Her ornate palace gown was dyed with blood, the skirt eerily empty\u2014her legs had been cut off!There was the sound of footsteps, and Shangguan Yue looked up with much difficulty.A familiar face appeared before her eyes.Her heart wildly trembled because the person who appeared was none other than her fianc\u00e9e whom she was set to wed\u2014Jiang Yucheng!\u201cShangguan Yue, how does it feel to lose your force and become an invalid?\u201dShangguan Yue looked at him in disbelief. \u201cIt was you!\u201dJiang Yucheng smiled. \u201cHow does the snow tea that I have been brewing for you for the past three years taste with a side of mortalizing powder?\u201dShangguan Yue froze, then laughed desolately. She thought they had a perfect romance, but he had been out to get her right from the start! The expression on her face gradually turned cold. \u201cJiang Yucheng, do you know what the punishment for murdering the princess is?\u201dJiang Yucheng smiled and remained silent, but a female voice appeared in the main hall. \u201cSister, now that things have come to this, do you still think that you\u2019re still the high and mighty princess?\u201dShangguan Yue whipped her head around, and a girl walked in elegantly. It was the sister that she doted on the most\u2014Shangguan Wan!The face that was usually gentle and timid was now obnoxious and arrogant!\u201cOne day and one night, you\u2019ve lost almost all your blood. Who\u2019s going to come and save you? Our critically ill father, or your Thirteen Yue Guard far away at the frontiers?\u201dShangguan Yue\u2019s heart turned cold. \u201cFather\u2019s illness\u2026 it was you?!\u201d They were probably behind the departure of the Thirteen Yue Guard as well!Shangguan Wan blinked and patted her chest before she looked towards Jiang Yucheng coyly.\u201cYucheng, sister\u2019s so fierce. Wan\u2019er is scared.\u201dJiang Yucheng smiled as he put his arm around her waist. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to be scared of? She\u2019s nothing but an invalid now. If we use her blood to cultivate your Yuan meridian, your talents will increase drastically. By then, everything will be yours!\u201dShangguan Wan looked at her sister with jealousy. \u201cSister, you were born with a Tianjing Yuan meridian, crowned as the ordained princess. Everything you had was the best! But why? Just because your mother was the queen, while mine was a concubine?\u201dShe was indignant, so she wanted to take everything that Shangguan Yue had and make it hers. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. From now on, the man you love and your future throne, I will take good care of them on your behalf!\u201dShangguan Yue felt that there were weights on her chest and that she was about to explode! The two people that she trusted the most were betraying her!As Shangguan Wan admired her sister\u2019s tortured expression, it did not seem to be enough for her. \u201cOh, right. Sister, on account of your care all these years, I\u2019ll make sure to send you off properly. Hopefully, you can be reunited with your mother and brother, who died young,\u201d she added.The words were like grenades that exploded by Shangguan Yue\u2019s ears. Could it be that her mother and brother\u2019s fatal accident by the frozen lake was not an accident?\u201cDid you know that when seventh brother died, he was still calling for you\u2026\u201d\u201cShangguan Wan!\u201d Shangguan Yue cried out.Harming her father, betraying her, cutting off her legs, and trapping her here. All of these crimes were unpardonable! Little did she expect that her revered mother and favorite brother had perished in their hands too!She glared at the pair with bloodshot eyes as if she were a demon from the depths of hell. In the next instance, a crimson fire swept across the hall. Shangguan Yue had activated the self-destruction mechanism of the Tianjing Yuan meridian in her body.A fireball the size of a longan flew out and headed straight for Shangguan Wan\u2019s dantian!Shangguan Wan immediately felt her Yuan meridian burning! She began screaming in panic. \u201cMy Yuan meridian!\u201dEven though Jiang Yucheng managed to avoid it narrowly, half of his right arm had been sliced off!\u201cIf I get a second chance at life\u2026 I\u2019ll have my vengeance!\u201d Shangguan Yue\u2019s words were like a curse!Nobody saw the flashing cryptic characters that formed on the pool of blood!\u2026Year 1653 of the Tianling Dynasty. Princess Shangguan Yue passed away because of Qi deviation.\u2026Pain!Pain that could be felt in the bones!It was like her flesh was being ripped apart and burned!A fuzzy voice appeared in her ears. \u201cHeh heh, big brother, even though this lass is like a twig, her face is stunning. Isn\u2019t it kind of a waste to kill her just like this?\u201d\u201cYeah! Big brother, no matter what, she is the Chu family\u2019s Big Missy. It must feel good to play with her!\u201d\u201cCheh, what Big Missy? This useless thing that doesn\u2019t even have the Yuan meridian. The entire Chu family treats her as the family\u2019s black sheep!\u201d\u201cBig brother, since Third Missy only said to make her disappear, can\u2019t we just burn everything after we\u2019re done? It\u2019s not like people from the Chu family will come looking for her.\u201dFire?Fire!There was a sharp pain in Shangguan Yue\u2019s brain, and she opened her eyes!Underneath the blinding lights, she saw a perverse looking man reaching towards her chest!\u201cYou must be tired of living!\u201d Shangguan Yue cried out, only to find that her voice was completely different from before! Her voice was raspy as if she had not had water for a long time. However, it was rather obvious that the voice belonged to a 12-year-old or 13-year-old girl!Before she could think things through, she grabbed the man\u2019s wrist and bent it hard. At the same time, she kicked her leg out!\u201cAh!\u201d A tragic cry echoed in the forest!In his moment of carelessness, the man was kicked backward, and his hand was in an eerie state. It had been broken with brute force!\u201cBig brother!\u201d The two men behind him were stunned as they rushed to catch him. They were shocked to see that the man had been hurt as they turned towards the girl.What was going on?! Chu Liuyue was known for being the Chu family\u2019s most useless member. She could not fight at all. Otherwise, she would not have been brought to this misty forest after they easily knocked her out!But now, she managed to break the big brother\u2019s hand!\u201cYou little b*tch. How dare you raise your hand against me, Song Lian? I think you are the one who\u2019s tired of living. Brothers, go and bring her over here!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Even though they were confused, they rushed over without much thought.The three of them were stage two warriors; how could Chu Liuyue be their match? That must have been a fluke!Shangguan Yue narrowed her eyes as she regarded the two men advancing toward her. A dark light flashed across her eyes. She then ran straight for the two men!Just as the three were about to clash, the two men swung their knives!Shangguan Yue seemed to have been expecting that. She bent and took a step aside, heading straight toward one of the men.Just inches away, she easily grabbed the man\u2019s wrist and pressed down hard in a certain position!A sense of powerlessness originated from her wrist, and the man\u2019s knife froze right above the young girl\u2019s head!Shangguan Yue\u2019s eyes turned cold as she turned. The direction of the knife changed and decapitated the man directly!Warm blood splattered all across her face, but she did not even bat an eyelid!Dong!She released her hand emotionlessly, and the headless man fell to the ground!A cold breeze came from behind her!She struck with the knife without looking back at all!The man, who was trying to sneak up on her, widened his eyes. Before his knife could land, he had been slashed across the waist!Dong!The clean cut sent chills down one\u2019s spine!Song Lian was stunned by everything that was unfolding before his eyes. What\u2019s going on?! Chu Liuyue managed to kill two stage two warriors in the blink of an eye!\u201cCh-chu Liuyue?! Are you insane?!\u201d Song Lian\u2019s voice was much sharper because of fear.Shangguan Yue turned and frowned as she looked at the man who was supposed to kill her. She did not know them. Besides, they were too weak. At the very least, they should have sent stage eight warriors if they wanted to kill her. But now this\u2026That\u2019s not right! Wasn\u2019t I already dead? I was harmed by Jiang Yucheng and Shangguan Wan together in the royal family\u2019s ancestral hall! Now\u2026She suddenly looked down at her hand that was holding onto the knife. This was a pair of slender and weak hands, but they had a number of calluses because of all the hard work it had done.These aren\u2019t my hands! Also, that man from earlier called me\u2026 Chu Liuyue?! Her gaze changed as she pieced everything together. \u201cThird Missy sent you to kill me?\u201dSong Lian wanted to take the chance to kill Chu Liuyue, but the two people before him had died so tragically. Although he was not sure what kind of spell Chu Liuyue was under, he dared not act rashly.His actions of kneeling down and crying out changed her thoughts and expression.\u201cYes! Yes! It was all Third Missy\u2019s orders! She asked us to abduct you while you were out shopping! She said she would give us 600 taels of silver as long as we made you disappear without anyone knowing! Big Missy, please have mercy on me! It was a moment of folly!\u201dBig Missy? Shangguan Yue felt her head throb when she heard that as if something was rushing to her head! The sharp pain made her take a step back, and her face was pale as a sheet.Song Lian glanced at her, and his eyes turned vicious. In for a penny, in for a pound! The moment was now!\u201cDie!\u201d As he cried out, he suddenly got up and flew towards Shangguan Yue! His energy was suddenly much stronger than it was before! He was already a stage three warrior!But just as he was about to reach Shangguan Yue, a knife pierced his chest first!It was the knife in Shangguan Yue\u2019s hand!Song Lian looked down in disbelief. How\u2026 When did Chu Liuyue become so strong?He would never know the answer.Bang!The last one was killed too!There was nothing but silence in the forest.If not for the three bodies on the ground, nobody would ever expect such a skinny young girl to have that much strength!Shangguan Yue supported herself using a tree. When the pain subsided, she realized that another person\u2019s memories were in her head. After sorting everything out, she slowly opened her eyes and sighed.It turned out that she had been reborn into the body of a young girl named Chu Liuyue. Chu Liuyue\u2014the big missy of the Chu family\u2014was from one of the four big families in Country Yao Chen.Even though she was the big missy, her life was worse than the servants. She was born with a lacking Yuan meridian, so she could not cultivate. Therefore, she was seen as the shame of the Chu family.Chu Liuyue\u2019s mother died when she was very young. Her father, Chu Ning, had been first in line to be the family\u2019s next head but was injured a few years ago. From then on, his status in the family plummeted. As such, it was not hard to imagine how hard she had been bullied since young.The Third Missy that wanted to kill her was her second uncle, Chu Yao\u2019s daughter\u2014Chu Xianmin. She wanted to kill Chu Liuyue because of the marriage agreement that Chu Liuyue had.It was with Country Yao Chen\u2019s Crown Prince, Rong Jin!Chu Liuyue would turn 14 in a month, and the engagement ceremony would be held then!It was not only Chu Xianmin, but countless people also tried to kill her in the dark!Shangguan Yue stood up, curling her pale lips into a smile. If she recalled correctly, Country Yao Chen was a subsidiary country of Tianling Dynasty!This was not the end of her!She was Chu Liuyue from now on!The vengeance from her last life would be paid back a hundred-fold in this life!Liked it?

It belonged to the original Chu Liuyue.She frowned when she opened and looked through it.There was quite a bit of money in the bag, alongside a bunch of jewels. Even though they were nothing special to the eyes of Shangguan Yue, who used to be a princess, they were quite a fortune to a downtrodden girl from the meager Chu family.Was she going to run away? Chu Liuyue scoffed.Chu Liuyue could never bear to leave her father behind if she were running away, not to mention that Chu Liuyue was a timid girl, who would never have the courage to do that.Most important of all, how could Chu Liuyue, someone who was pushed around by the Chu family, have the opportunity to get her hands on so much cash and jewelry? Someone was clearly trying to frame her!If Song Lian and his family were behind it, they had to put on a show just to keep things under wraps.If people found Chu Liuyue\u2019s body and saw the items, they would have assumed that she had stolen things and ran away under the pretext of shopping.Thieves deserved to die!Chu Xianmin was trying to ruin her, even after she died!Since she was borrowing Chu Liuyue\u2019s body, then she had to settle this for her host. Besides, Chu Liuyue\u2019s identity made her future operations much easier.After looking through everything, Chu Liuyue looked around. She could hear the faint sound of a stream.She was covered in blood and dirt right now, and she really needed to take a shower. Conveniently for her, there were fresh clothes in the baggage.\u2026Cutting through the lush forest for about 15 minutes, Chu Liuyue finally arrived at an azure-blue lake.What was astonishing was the layer of fog floating above the lake.Even from where she was standing on the bank, she could only see the lake water near her. Everything else was obscured.Chu Liuyue stretched out her hand and was a little surprised when she ran it through the fog.This fog is formed by extremely concentrated force! If I cultivated here, I would improve drastically!As the princess, the heir to the Tianling Dynasty, she knew the ten subsidiary countries rather well. Even though such a place could not compare to the places where she used to cultivate, it was considered great in a small place like Country Yao Chen.At this time, there was a low roar.She looked up and saw a snow-white tiger by the lake, staring at her with icy-blue eyes! This was a high-stage demonic beast!Just as Chu Liuyue was thinking of how to deal with it, it suddenly shook its tail and lay down again, closing its eyes.Chu Liuyue was stunned.Is it going to leave me alone? However, guardian beasts are supposed to be very hot-tempered!Before she could finish her thoughts, the lion opened its eyes and glanced at her. It then stood up and walked towards her!When it reached her, the white lion raised its paw and swept Chu Liuyue\u2019s baggage to the floor and nudged her forward with its head.\u201cYou want me to go in?\u201d asked Chu Liuyue uncertainly.The white lion sat down on the ground as it looked Chu Liuyue in the eyes as if telling her that it would not leave if she did not enter.Chu Liuyue was speechless.She laughed, thinking the white lion was rather cute. She patted it on the head, and the lion closed its eyes contentedly.She then removed her blood and filth covered clothes and stepped into the lake, allowing the warm water to surround her.A vigorous and warm force gushed towards her.Chu Liuyue closed her eyes as she began examining the condition of this body.\u2026Mainland Xuan Wu was about survival of the fittest.There were two kinds of cultivators. One kind was warriors, who absorbed the Heaven and Earth Force into their flesh and blood. The other kind was Xuan Masters, who could muster their force through amulets and see into the workings of Heaven and Earth Force.Although both were classified as cultivators, the conditions for becoming a Xuan Master were much higher, so they were rarer and more respected.In order to become a cultivator, one had to possess the Yuan meridian. The Yuan meridian was the only medium through which cultivators could take in Heaven and Earth Force, so it was especially important.There were four grades to a Yuan meridian: Tianjing, Dijing, Xuanjing, and Huangjing.Tianjing was the highest grade. Even the Tianling Dynasty had only produced two people with a Tianjing Yuan meridian in 1,000 years.The first was the founder of the dynasty. The other was\u2026 her.This was also why she was the most revered princess! To her, cultivation was as simple as it could be. However, her current body had a defective Yuan meridian. It could channel force, but it could not contain it, much less transform it into powers for Chu Liuyue\u2019s use.Chu Liuyue was therefore born a good for nothing!\u201cSeems like I have to restore this Yuan meridian first\u2026\u201d mumbled Chu Liuyue.Other people\u2019s jaws would drop if they heard her. How could the Yuan meridian, which was inborn, be repaired?Probably nobody in the entire Country Yao Chen was capable of doing that! However, it was nothing to Shangguan Yue, who was once the princess of the Tianling Dynasty!Heavenly doctors were the most secretive and revered existences on the mainland. They could revive the dead and restore skeletons to human form. Nothing was impossible for them! But becoming a heavenly doctor was even tougher than becoming a Xuan Master! Their cultivation was different from Xuan Masters and Warriors as well.Even if it was a piece of rotten wood, Chu Liuyue could perform magic with it!I wonder what grade the Yuan meridian will be after restoration\u2026 As she was thinking, a red light flashed before Chu Liuyue\u2019s eyes!She looked towards her hands with knitted brows, only to see a strange crimson amulet text appearing on her palms!\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d She had never seen the text, nor did she know of its origins. Did this belong to the original Chu Liuyue? Just as the thought flashed across her head, she felt a sense of familiarity. It was as if the text belonged to her!The text flashed, then disappeared quickly.Before Chu Liuyue could focus on it, she felt a new sensation in her dantian.The originally withered dantian was filled with a red light! Floating right in the middle of her dantian was the text that Chu Liuyue had seen earlier!She took a closer look and focused her energy.The text did not exist alone. It was inscribed on a transparent book page! The page was extremely thin as if it was ripped off from a book. The edges were uneven as the page hovered there. It would be hard to see if not for the crimson text.Just as Chu Liuyue was about to take a closer look out of curiosity, the transparent book page turned into a puddle and formed a small lake in her dantian.The amulet text disappeared completely as if it had never appeared.Chu Liuyue looked towards her palms. There was no trace of anything.Her body returned to its usual tranquility.As she pondered, she could not understand what was going on, so she chose to stop thinking about it. It did not seem like it would hurt her.It was more important to settle the troubles of her host first!She turned around, about to return to shore when her eyes turned cold. She hid her body in the water and looked straight ahead. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d At the same time, she removed her hairpin and held it in her hand, ready to strike!In the thick fog, there was an elusive, tall figure. It was accompanied by the deep, gentle voice of a man, which seemed to be concealing a smile. \u201cLittle lady, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for you to be trespassing on other people\u2019s territory.\u201dPerhaps it was because of the foggy atmosphere, but his words were a little dragged out, tinted with a hint of laziness. It was like a breeze plucking at the strings of a musical instrument. It was captivating.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: She\u2019s Alive!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosA man was actually hiding in the middle of the lake!Chu Liuyue was shocked. She had been coming here for so long, but she was clueless about it. Although she no longer had her previous body\u2019s strength, she was still sharp, and her eyesight still excellent. Otherwise, it would be impossible for her to take care of Song Lian and his two other companions by herself just now.This man must be very strong.\u201cIs this your territory?\u201d she asked cautiously.The water rippled. Chu Liuyue could vaguely see a tall figure coming out of the water. His silhouette could be seen through a veil of white mist.Straight shoulders, a broad back, and a curvy figure were vaguely hidden by the lake.Chu Liuyue gripped her hairpin tightly as she continued to stare. She had just been reborn; she didn\u2019t want to die again.A low laugh came out of nowhere. \u201cDo I look that good?\u201dA gust of wind dispersed the white mist. That man\u2019s figure became clearer. It seemed that he was keen to meet her face to face.Chu Liuyue sneered inwardly. She had seen worse. Why should she be intimidated by this? \u201cI can\u2019t get a good look with the mist in our way. Let me take a closer look; I can give you my answer then.\u201dThe flowing mist came to a sudden stop. The man probably didn\u2019t expect a young lady like her to talk in this manner.\u201cIf you are really that keen, I will be happy to oblige. However, I\u2019m worried you\u2019ll stab me with your hairpin before you\u2019ve seen more.\u201d He didn\u2019t seem annoyed because there was laughter in his voice.Chu Liuyue remained silent. The man was strong, smart, and definitely not easy to deal with. He had figured out her intentions with one glance. She wouldn\u2019t face such a person head-on when dealing with them.She simply rolled her eyes, pulled her hair back, and calmly inserted the hairpin into her bun smoothly. \u201cMy apologies. I didn\u2019t know this was your territory. I thought there was nobody until I intruded. I hope you will forgive me for my intrusion.\u201dThe man was silent for a moment.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201d His voice sounded distant.Chu Liuyue was flabbergasted. Was he letting her off this easily? Her mind was so confused that she didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cThe water in Lake Bibo may be good for health, but your meridian points are blocked. It\u2019s better if you don\u2019t stay for long.\u201d The man stood up and made his way to the shore as soon as he said that. In a flash, he was done dressing.Chu Liuyue could barely make out his silhouette despite the white mist. She could still see the man\u2019s figure. Indeed, it was a really good one.She, too, wore her clothes with haste without feeling embarrassed and left. This was not a man to be trifled with.Before she could take a step, the man\u2019s voice rang behind her. \u201cYoung lady, I have no wish to pursue this matter, but I have to know who has intruded into my territory today.\u201dThe tone of his voice was smooth, but it carried a hint of a superior person\u2019s irrefutable nobility.Are his words meant to intimidate me into telling him my name? Chu Liuyue turned around. A man was standing not too far away from her.She held her breath.When she was a princess, she saw countless talented and handsome young men. Her fianc\u00e9, Jiang Yucheng, was also the most handsome man in Tianling Dynasty.Nevertheless, she couldn\u2019t help but feel amazed when she first laid her eyes on this man.He had a pair of saber-like eyebrows which slanted into his temples, a straight nose, and sparkling eyes. Even the most beautiful starry night sky couldn\u2019t compare to those deep eyes. One glance at those eyes was enough to make one crazy and sink into its light.His scarlet lips were lightly pressed together into a flawless radian, which appeared thin. However, the bead in the middle of one of his lips made them look redder.His eyes were the cleanest starry night in the world, while his lips were the most ambiguous spring color in the world. He was pure yet mysterious. He was elegant and noble, like an impenetrable contradictory form that seemed to drive one crazy as it attracted all the attention.Chu Liuyue sized him up, and a word came into her mind\u2014Demon!\u201cChu Liuyue.\u201d She had no intention of hiding her identity. After all, he looked like a man of many means. Lying would only cause more problems.The man stood across her and stared, but his gaze was like the moonlight as his eyes lightly grazed past her. They finally remained fixed on her face. \u201cLet\u2019s forget about this since Xue Xue was the one who let you in.\u201dXue Xue? Is it that white lion?The man suddenly stepped forward and approached Chu Liuyue until he stood in front of her.Chu Liuyue was on high alert. However, she suppressed her feelings so as not to show him any hostility. She looked at him calmly.He stood unmovingly. Suddenly, he reached out and grazed her cheek lightly with his warm fingertip. \u201cLady Chu, you can\u2019t go home in such a mess with blood on your face.\u201dChu Liuyue was shocked. She looked down and saw the bloodstain on his fingertip.The two breathed, taking in each other\u2019s scent for a moment.His deep voice stirred her eardrums. \u201cAlso, my name is Rong Xiu.\u201d Before Chu Liuyue could say anything, he told her, \u201cYou should go.\u201dChu Liuyue pursed her lips. She might not know what he was up to, but she had a feeling that there was another battle to be fought when she returned to the Chu family. \u201cThank you.\u201d\u2026It wasn\u2019t until the young girl\u2019s slender figure completely disappeared into the forest that Rong Xiu finally withdrew his gaze and glanced at the white lion.His warm and friendly demeanor dimmed a few notches. \u201cDid you betray your master to get into her good graces?\u201dThe white lion was motionless.\u201cIf you pretend to be dead, I will tell her your other name is Hua Hua when I see her the next time.\u201dRoar!The white lion suddenly stood up. Its name was Xue Hua [Snowflake], not Hua Hua! It would be so embarrassing if others came to know about this.\u201cThe Imperial City should be quite crowded these days, so I\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201dXue Hua\u2019s eyes lit up.\u2026The atmosphere in the Chu family\u2019s hall was tense.Anxiety was written all over Chu Ning\u2019s face. He paced around uneasily while looking out nervously.\u201cYue\u2019er has been gone for the whole day. It\u2019s already evening. Why isn\u2019t she back yet? First Elder, we should send a search party out quickly.\u201dWhat should they do if something happened to her? Yue\u2019er was completely defenseless.First Elder, Chu Xiao, sipped his tea and told him nonchalantly, \u201cChu Ning, stop fretting. This isn\u2019t the first time she has gone out. What could happen? Perhaps, she was having so much fun that she simply forgot the time.\u201dChu Ning was extremely anxious, but he knew they wouldn\u2019t agree to his request. It\u2019s getting dark. Yue\u2019er wouldn\u2019t be so insensible. She should be back by now. \u201cI will search for her myself!\u201d He went out alone without waiting for them.The Third Missy, Chu Xianmin, came dressed in a yellow dress. She had a pretty face. She respectfully bowed before saying with a whimper, \u201cFirst Elder, I know that my sister hasn\u2019t come back yet, so I shouldn\u2019t bother you. B-but\u2026 there is something that I don\u2019t dare to hide\u2014my things have been stolen.\u201dFirst Elder frowned. \u201cWhat happened?\u201dTears began to well up in Chu Xianmin\u2019s eyes. \u201cI invited my sister to my room this morning, wanting to give her some money so she could buy something for herself when she went out. However, when I checked earlier, all the money and jewelry my parents gave me were missing.\u201dChu Ning barked. \u201cWhat are you trying to say? Are you implying that Yue\u2019er is the thief?\u201dChu Xianmin cried harder. Aggrieved, tears fell from her eyes.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that\u2026 How could I accuse my sister? However, she was the only one who has gone into my room today.\u201dFirst Elder squinted his eyes. \u201cPerhaps\u2026 she stole Xianmin\u2019s money and ran away? How dare she!\u201dChu Ning was about to argue when he heard the announcement.\u201cBig Missy is back!\u201dEveryone in the hall froze.A tear had been lingering at the corner of Chu Xianmin\u2019s eye as she concealed her disbelief. How? Chu Liuyue should be\u2026A petite silhouette approached against the light.\u201cFirst Elder must be joking. As the Chu family\u2019s eldest daughter, I have a share of all the family\u2019s assets. Why would I steal my sister\u2019s money and betray my family?\u201d Chu Liuyue walked into the hall with a smile, but it made Chu Xianmin quiver. \u201cAm I right, Sister?\u201dLiked it?

It really is Chu Liuyue! How could this be? Song Lian and his two lackeys aren\u2019t weaklings. It should be a piece of cake for them to deal with a mere Chu Liuyue. Everything has been arranged, but Chu Liuyue still\u2026\u201cYue\u2019er!\u201d Chu Ning rushed over nervously the moment he saw his daughter. \u201cYue\u2019er, what happened to you?\u201dThe worrying look in Chu Ning\u2019s eyes warmed Chu Liuyue\u2019s heart. She could feel it. Chu Ning truly loved his daughter. Even though she was a loser, his love for her as a father had not lessened.A pity. The real Chu Liuyue was dead.Chu Liuyue patted Chu Ning\u2019s hand and gave him a reassuring smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Father. I\u2019m fine.\u201dChu Ning was still unconvinced even after her reassurance. However, upon a closer look, she didn\u2019t seem to be hurt. He finally let go of that stone in his heart. For some reason, he was puzzled when he saw the smile on his daughter\u2019s face. There was something different about her. In the past, Yue\u2019er was always submissive and delicate. However, at this moment, her black irises seemed to be sparkling like the brightest stars in the night sky.\u201cSister, you\u2019re back! I was sick with worry.\u201dChu Liuyue looked up and saw that Chu Xianmin looked ecstatic as if she was truly happy to see Chu Liuyue.Worried? Chu Liuyue sneered inwardly. Chu Xianmin\u2019s worry was more from fear of seeing her safe return. \u201cOh? Were you really worried about me, Third Sister? I seem to recall that you were accusing me of theft just now when I was standing outside,\u201d retorted Chu Liuyue, unflustered.Chu Xianmin felt a cold sweat form on her back in an instant. What the h*ll is going on with this Chu Liuyue? Not only did she survive her ordeal, but she also seems to be a changed person! She actually dared to question me in front of so many people!\u201cDear Sister, you must be mistaken. You were not back, and it was getting late. I was anxious and came to ask First Elder about it.\u201d With that, her eyes started to well up with tears again. \u201cAfter all\u2026 you can\u2019t even protect yourself. If you were bullied while you were out, I wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive myself.\u201d Chu Xianmin was deliberately mocking her for being a loser because she couldn\u2019t cultivate.If it was the former Chu Liuyue, she would have been deceived by Chu Xianmin\u2019s act, that the latter had truly been worried. However, Chu Liuyue was a changed person. She would not be tricked by Chu Xianmin\u2019s unorthodox means.Chu Xianmin was the most gifted amongst the Chu family\u2019s younger generation. By saying such things, she was implying that Chu Liuyue was useless. Even her leaving the house was a problem!Sure enough, First Elder\u2019s eyes immediately filled with disgust as he reprimanded angrily. \u201cWho knows what you\u2019ve been doing out so late today! If you can\u2019t even handle such trivial matters, don\u2019t bother going out anymore! You\u2019ll only shame our family name. Such a good-for-nothing!\u201dChu Ning\u2019s expression suddenly turned cold. He stepped forward, shielding Chu Liuyue behind him. With both fists tightly clenched by his side, he forced himself to restrain his emotions. \u201cFirst Elder, Yue\u2019er is still a child. Aren\u2019t you being too harsh on her?\u201d He might not be who he used to be, but he simply couldn\u2019t allow other people to bully his daughter.Chu Liuyue was startled as she stared at the towering figure in front of her. She was overwhelmed. In her last life, she was destined to be a strong and noble princess. She always handled everything herself. To her, being loved was a foreign feeling that was too precious.She would do everything to protect the people who truly loved her this time. Whatever it took.\u201cFather.\u201d Chu Liuyue tugged his hand and stepped forward.Chu Ning looked at her, fully expecting her to give in like she always did. However, all he saw was calmness in her eyes.The petite girl straightened her back and lifted her chin. There was an inexplicable strength within her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, First Elder. Everything that needed to be bought is in order and is being delivered to the warehouse. You can go and check if you don\u2019t believe me. As for why I came back so late today, I think Third Sister knows best.\u201d\u201cSister, what nonsense are you spouting?\u201d Chu Xianmin panicked when she heard this. The tone of her voice became hostile. Has Chu Liuyue already guessed that I sent Song Lian and the others?Chu Liuyue looked at her with a smile, feigning surprise. \u201cSister, didn\u2019t you give me the silver taels to help you to buy something?\u201dChu Xianmin was stumped. She did no such thing! But\u2026 that was exactly what she had just said to First Elder and Chu Ning. She had wanted to take this opportunity to frame Chu Liuyue, but the latter had taken advantage of the situation for her benefit.Chu Liuyue stretched out her hand. A jade pendant shaped like a pomegranate was lying in her palm. \u201cThird Sister, since the money you gave me was not enough, I left your other Flower Moon Pomegranate Jade Pendant as collateral in Zhen Bao Pavilion. You may have it back when you send the rest of the money tomorrow.\u201dThe jade pendant was a dowry brought by Chu Xianmin\u2019s mother. Not only was it very precious because of its exquisiteness, but also because it could warm one\u2019s body. There was nothing like it in the whole of Imperial City. Chu Xianmin was very fond of it, and she wore it often.Everyone would testify that it belonged to Chu Xianmin for precisely the same reason.When First Elder heard this, he looked at Chu Xianmin with suspicion. \u201cMinmin, is what she said true?\u201d The pendant was her treasured belonging. It would be difficult for anyone to take it unless she gave it to them.It would have been fine if she had bought something else, but Zhen Bao Pavilion was the most luxurious place in the entire Imperial City. Everything inside was of good quality and considerable value.Although the Chu family was also a noble family, its status had gradually declined in recent years. It was not as glamorous as it appeared to be. Even as one of the Chu Family\u2019s elders, he couldn\u2019t just squander money in a place like Zhen Bao Pavilion!Chu Xianmin gritted her teeth secretly. It was a deliberate plot to make everyone believe that Chu Liuyue had stolen something and fled. Who would\u2019ve thought that her plan would backfire?\u201cY-Yes\u2026 I like one of the items in Zhen Bao Pavilion. I asked Sister to go on my behalf. Lately, I\u2019ve been too occupied with my cultivation to leave the house.\u201d She had no choice but to go with the flow. The things in Zhen Bao Pavilion might be costly. Nevertheless, she could still afford to buy one or two items.She would have to find out about the Song Lian trio\u2019s situation before she could deal with Chu Liuyue.At the mention of her cultivation, First Elder\u2019s demeanor softened considerably. He said warmly, \u201cWhat does it matter? You are the best in our Chu family\u2019s younger generation. You can have anything you want!\u201dChu Xianmin smiled sweetly. \u201cThank you very much, First Elder.\u201dChu Liuyue laughed inwardly. It\u2019s not that easy to get away with this. For the time being, she couldn\u2019t completely antagonize Chu Xianmin. However, it was also impossible for her to suffer in silence. \u201cFirst Elder, are you planning to help my sister pay the rest of the money using the family\u2019s accounts?\u201d asked Chu Liuyue curiously.First Elder and Chu Xianmin were stunned in unison. Then, both hesitated.The Chu family\u2019s rules were strict. Everyone\u2019s monthly salary was distributed according to their ranks. If First Elder forked out money for Chu Xianmin from the family\u2019s account, he would be upsetting the other family members.\u201cThis is Minmin\u2019s business. She should be responsible for it.\u201dChu Xianmin worked hard to maintain her reputation over the years. Naturally, she couldn\u2019t allow it to be tarnished. She took matters into her own hands right then and there.The items in Zhen Bao Pavilion might be expensive, but she was everyone\u2019s favorite, so she managed to save a fair amount of silver. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem for her to spend several thousand silver taels on one or two items.She pretended to be generous and gentle as she looked at Chu Liuyue with a smile. \u201cSister, you can pick up the treasure tomorrow?\u201dChu Liuyue nodded as a sly look flashed in her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ve already paid Zhen Bao Pavilion with the 1,000 silver taels you gave me. You only have to give me the remaining 199,000 taels tomorrow.\u201dChu Xianmin thought she had misheard, and she screamed subconsciously. \u201cWhat?!\u201dLiked it?

Didn\u2019t you say that you fancied the carved red jade pendant from Zhen Bao Pavilion and asked me to buy it for you? Its price is naturally high as it is the most treasured item in the whole shop. Dear Sister, do\u2026 you\u2026 not have the money? B-but\u2026 the staff at the pavilion has already made an exception for me. On account of our family name, they agreed to let me buy the pendant with an advanced payment of 1,000 taels.\u201d Chu Liuyue looked embarrassed.First Elder\u2014who had been standing beside her\u2014almost stopped breathing. That was 199,000 silver taels! Even for the Chu family, it wasn\u2019t easy to come up with that amount of money at once. He stared at Chu Xianmin. No matter how much he had favored her, he was only greatly dissatisfied with her at the moment. He reprimanded her coldly. \u201cMinmin! You\u2019re too ignorant for your own good!\u201dThey had to buy this pendant at all costs now that their family name was on the line. Otherwise, if word of this was to get out, they wouldn\u2019t know what other people would say about the Chu family.Chu Xianmin opened her mouth to defend herself, but nothing could come out. She didn\u2019t even ask Chu Liuyue to buy anything for her, not to mention the carved red jade pendant in Zhen Bao Pavilion that was worth 200,000 silver taels.That pendant had been famous for a long time. It was a treasure made from the finest red jade. Although it was good for cultivation, it was far from being worth 200,000 silver taels! That\u2019s why it remained unsold in the shop for the longest time!She never expected Chu Liuyue to be so scheming.Chu Liuyue planned for Chu Xianmin to cough up the 200,000 silver taels herself!Chu Xianmin shook with anger. If First Elder wasn\u2019t here, she would have pounded Chu Liuyue and shredded her into pieces!Throughout all these years, all she had managed to save was only about 4,000 to 5,000 silver taels. Two hundred thousand silver taels were too massive a hole for her to fill.However,\u2026 the Chu family\u2019s name was on the line. She had to take care of this matter at all costs.\u201cI-I\u2026 I will definitely pay for this out of my own pocket. First Elder, you mustn\u2019t worry about it.\u201d With gritted teeth, she forced a smile. \u201cMother has always loved me. She had promised to fulfill one of my requests if I came in first place in the academy\u2019s assessment.\u201dChu Xianmin\u2019s mother, Lu Yao, came from the Lu family\u2014one of the top merchant families in the entire Imperial City.She said this to show that she could get the money and wouldn\u2019t make things difficult for the Chu family no matter what. On the other hand, she also wanted to use the Lu family\u2019s name to elevate her status.As she expected, First Elder\u2019s demeanor softened considerably upon hearing the Lu family\u2019s name.\u201cIndeed, your mother loves you the most because you are an outstanding daughter. I recall that the academy\u2019s assessment is in one month\u2019s time?\u201dTian Lu Academy was the school Chu Xianmin had been studying at. It was also the most prominent academy to have ever existed in the entire Country Yao Chen. Those who entered the academy were all enviable geniuses. Even children of royal blood wanted to enter and undergo their assessment.Simply because of this, Chu Xianmin was loved throughout the Chu family.\u201cYes.\u201d Chu Xianmin became much more energetic. Then, something occurred to her. A trace of shyness appeared on her pretty face. \u201cBrother Jin\u2026 His Highness also said that he would reward me if I placed first in the assessment.\u201dChu Liuyue raised her eyebrows a notch.The \u2018Brother Jin\u2019 Chu Xianmin had just mentioned was none other than the current Crown Prince, Rong Jin. He was also engaged to Chu Liuyue.From her expression, anyone could tell that something was going on between Chu Xianmin and the Crown Prince.First Elder\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cReally?\u201dThe Crown Prince, a favorite of His Majesty, was highly gifted and capable. The Chu family had been declining. If they could climb up this enormous tree\u2014the Crown Prince\u2014everything would be different.Chu Xianmin seemed to have suddenly thought of something. She gave Chu Liuyue a quick glance and explained somewhat nervously, \u201cSister, there isn\u2019t any cause for misunderstanding. There is really nothing going on between Brother Jin and me. He is looking out for me simply because both of you are engaged. If you can get into the academy, I\u2019m sure Brother Jin will treat you\u2026\u201d She stopped talking abruptly.Everybody knew that Chu Liuyue was a born loser. She couldn\u2019t even cultivate normally, much less get into Tian Lu Academy.If someone had really cared about her engagement with the Crown Prince, Chu Liuyue wouldn\u2019t have been bullied to this extent!Chu Ning gritted his teeth, but his heart grew cold.The official engagement was in a month. He thought that would change the situation, but it now seemed like it was just his delusions.He had heard that the Crown Prince was interested in Chu Xianmin. However, he didn\u2019t expect that it had already reached such a blatant stage! They didn\u2019t care about Yue\u2019er at all! To think that his poor daughter had loved the Crown Prince wholeheartedly.Chu Xianmin was secretly complacent with herself as she looked at Chu Liuyue. She had expected to see pain on Chu Liuyue\u2019s face, but to her surprise, Chu Liuyue didn\u2019t seem to care at all.Not only was she not shocked or disappointed, but she even laughed! \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful as long as Third Sister can come up with the money.\u201dChu Xianmin was stunned. Why did she have the feeling that the Crown Prince wasn\u2019t as important as the 200,000 silver taels?\u201cFather and I will take our leave since the matter has now been settled.\u201d After saying that, Chu Liuyue actually turned around and left with Chu Ning.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Chu Xianmin felt a blockage in her chest as if her punch had landed on cotton.Chu Liuyue suddenly stopped and turned around at the doorway. Her dark, cold eyes pierced straight into Chu Xianmin\u2019s, and it actually brought on a pressurized silence. \u201cBy the way, Third Sister, it\u2019s better if you are careful with that mouth of yours from now on. If I hadn\u2019t come back in time today, everyone would have thought I had stolen your things and ran away. If that were the case, I would never be able to clear my name, right?\u201dChu Xianmin suddenly shivered. She knows! She must know. Chu Xianmin wanted to argue, but felt an invisible force over her head, making her unable to move.It wasn\u2019t until Chu Liuyue\u2019s figure disappeared outside the door that she gradually slowed down, her forehead covered in a cold sweat.Chu Xianmin\u2019s eyes flashed with fierce determination.She had to check on the Song Lian trio\u2019s situation before finding a way to deal with Chu Liuyue once and for all.\u2026Chu Liuyue and Chu Ning returned to the remote courtyard where they resided.\u201cYue\u2019er, you\u2019ve had a long day. Go and take a rest.\u201d Chu Ning felt pained as he patted Chu Liuyue\u2019s head.Chu Liuyue took in her surroundings quickly. Despite having the memories from her last life, she still sighed inwardly when she saw her surroundings.It wasn\u2019t a courtyard, but a few dilapidated houses that were almost completely deserted.It became clear as to what kind of life the father-daughter duo had been living.Nobody would believe that Chu Ning\u2014who was once the Chu family\u2019s next head\u2014and Chu Liuyue, the family\u2019s titular eldest daughter, would live in a place like this.Chu Liuyue nodded gently. \u201cThe same goes to you, Father.\u201dChu Ning moved his lips. He wanted to ask her something, but he could only sigh in the end.\u201cYue\u2019er, I know you like the Crown Prince, but I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s not the right man for you. Chu Xianmin is talented and has the support of the family clan. If you go against her like you did earlier, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201dChu Liuyue smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Father. I know what to do.\u201dChu Ning was full of worries. Suddenly, he was unable to speak when he looked into those smiling, calm eyes.Yue\u2019er\u2026 something is different about her. He nodded and ruffled his daughter\u2019s hair before leaving.Chu Liuyue\u2019s eyes landed on her father\u2019s right leg, which barely supported him, and quickly moved away while he pushed the door open.The night curtain rose outside. A pale ray of moonlight streamed in through the broken window.Chu Liuyue walked to the window. She tapped it gently, deep in thought.She had already asked for the date during the day. It was the seventh month\u2019s tenth day in year 832 of Country Yao Chen. It was exactly one year after \u2018she\u2019 died when she compared the date to the Tianling Dynasty\u2019s yearly calendar.In other words, she was reborn Chu Liuyue\u2019s body one year after her death. With her current status and strength, she needed to plan her revenge with great care.Suddenly, her expression changed. She swiftly turned her head towards her bed. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201dThere was dead silence in the room, and the air almost froze.For a moment, a pair of icy-blue eyes appeared in the darkened room.Taking a closer look, Chu Liuyue was shocked to see an enormous white lion lying obediently on her bed! \u201cXue Xue?\u201dLiked it?

Even though this white lion looked extremely ferocious, she could feel that it was very close to her; it had even reduced the domineering fiend aura around it.The white lion got up and jumped down from its bed, silently coming to Chu Liuyue\u2019s side. Its body was very big and bulky. In front of it, the originally thin Chu Liuyue looked even more petite, as if it could easily swallow her whole in one bite.Even the entire room seemed much narrower.Xue Xue\u2019s icy-blue eyes blinked, and it lowered its large head, swaying by Chu Liuyue\u2019s hand.Chu Liuyue was slightly taken aback and could not figure out what it wanted.As she did not budge, Xue Xue inched closer toward her and raised its head to look at her with its eyes wide open.Chu Liuyue\u2019s eyes twitched. Is it asking for a pat?She tentatively stuck out her hand and placed it on the lion\u2019s head to caress it gently. The unbelievably soft fur was great to touch; one could tell that it had lived a great life since it had such valuable fur.Xue Xue then closed its eyes in satisfaction and stretched its body. It wagged its tail and groaned in pleasure.Gu\u2026Chu Liuyue was speechless. Is it not intending to move away?\u201cHey, shouldn\u2019t you return to your master? Why are you sticking to me?\u201dHowever, Xue Xue did not mind her at all; its closed eyes did not move as if it really fell asleep.Chu Liuyue was caught between laughter and tears. Although she did not know the white lion\u2019s intentions, the sky was already very dark, and if she insisted on it going back, it might cause some commotion.By then, things would be even more problematic.After thinking for a while, Chu Liuyue decided not to be conflicted about this anymore. She patted its head gently and climbed up the bed to rest on her own.When she touched the blanket, she noticed that it was warm.A thought flashed across her mind. Did this fellow come here to warm the bed for me? The next moment, she could not help but laugh. I\u2019m thinking too much!\u201cIf you really must stay here, promise me that you won\u2019t let anyone else find out.\u201dXue Xue opened its eyes and wagged its tail happily.Chu Liuyue lay on the bed and went through her to-do list for the next day before she slowly drifted off to sleep.When she gradually fell into a deep sleep, the white lion\u2014which seemed to have fallen asleep much earlier\u2014slowly opened its eyes and looked at Chu Liuyue.Nobody knew what she dreamt of, but her eyebrows on her small face were tightly knitted; her forehead broke out into numerous droplets of cold sweat, and her lips were pale.A silver light glowed from Xue Xue\u2019s body and seeped into Chu Liuyue\u2019s body slowly and silently.In her sleep, Chu Liuyue just felt that her body was immersed in a pool of warm water, and it was very relaxing and comfortable. Then, she slowly relaxed her eyebrows and slept peacefully.\u2026When Chu Liuyue was sleeping peacefully, there was someone who could not fall asleep at all\u2014Chu Xianmin.\u201cSay it! What exactly is going on?\u201dIn Ting Fang Court, the main door was tightly shut.Chu Xianmin glared at the man kneeling before her, trying her best to control her anger.\u201cThis\u2026 I\u2026 Third Missy, I have already investigated it in detail, but I really can\u2019t find out the whereabouts of the Song Lian trio.\u201d Chu Liansheng\u2019s back broke out into a cold sweat.\u201cHow could this be possible?\u201d Chu Xianmin\u2019s sharp shrill voice interrupted his words. \u201cThe plan was perfect; it had no loopholes at all. Once Chu Liuyue stepped out of the door, she should have been directly hit unconscious and brought to Lin Zhong. That\u2019s it! Initially, you were the one who said that Song Lian was already a level three martial artist and that he wouldn\u2019t have a problem with dealing with a mere Chu Liuyue. What about now? Chu Liuyue didn\u2019t die, and even the Song Lian trio went missing! Is this how you complete your tasks?\u201d\u201cThird Missy, that should logically be correct. I personally witnessed them bringing Chu Liuyue out of the city gates, b-but\u2026 who would have thought that she wouldn\u2019t die?\u201dWhen he found out that Chu Liuyue came back alive, he felt that something was amiss and immediately went to trace the Song Lian trio\u2019s whereabouts. However, even when he had flipped the entire city upside down, the trio seemed to have disappeared into thin air. He then noticed that something was wrong.\u201cShe must have known that I planned it,\u201d said Chu Xianmin with hatred. She was frustrated beyond words when thinking about how she was previously stunned by a mere gaze from Chu Liuyue.\u201cThird Missy, so what if she knows? She\u2019s just a good-for-nothing. What else can she do?\u201d\u201cAre you dumb? If she really didn\u2019t do anything, then how did Song Lian and the rest go missing?\u201dChu Liansheng did not dare to utter another word.Chu Xianmin gritted her teeth secretly.She could not live in peace if Song Lian and the rest were not found. Who knew how Chu Liuyue came back alive and how she defeated those few people? If she used this against her\u2026\u201cContinue looking for them! Also, send someone to spy on Chu Liuyue. If there\u2019s anything amiss, report to me immediately!\u201d\u201cWill do!\u201dAfter Chu Liansheng left, Chu Xianmin\u2019s eyes gradually turned gloomy.Chu Liuyue already dared to turn her back on her and target her. Then, she should not blame her for being merciless.\u2026A good night\u2019s sleep.The next day when Chu Liuyue woke up, she found that Xue Xue had already left.It seemed like it was really keeping her company for the night.Chu Liuyue smiled and shook her head.This was her first night after her rebirth. Initially, she thought that it would be hard for her to fall asleep, but she did not expect to sleep so soundly. Her body also seemed much lighter and more relaxed than before, probably because of her good night\u2019s sleep.After washing up, Chu Liuyue sat in front of the mirror and looked at her new face.In the old and blurry bronze mirror, there was a young lady\u2019s face. Probably because she was malnourished regularly, her originally 14-year-old face looked as if she was just 12.Her dark, round, and watery eyes looked even bigger. Even if so, it was not hard to tell that this small face was naturally pretty. Now, she was still young. Later on, when she grew up, she would definitely be an enchanting beauty.Perhaps because the core personality had changed, the pair of weak and shy eyes had turned into solemn and determined ones that shone like the stars in the sky. There was even a trace of an elegant aura coming from her.Just like a pearl covered in dust, it was time for the pearl to shine brightly after the dust was wiped away.Chu Liuyue stared at her face and her gaze changed. After some time, she sighed.This face was actually quite similar to hers in her previous life.Almost immediately, she calmed her heart and briefly packed a few things before going out.\u2026The Chu family\u2019s rules were very strict, and they would check people coming in and out sternly. However, as Chu Liuyue was of lowly status and would usually be sent to do a slave\u2019s tasks, the guards did not interrogate her much when she left.Unknowingly, this also helped her greatly in her tasks.After leaving the Chu family\u2019s estate, she went straight to Zhen Bao Pavilion.The moment she stepped in, a middle-aged man welcomed her with a face full of smiles.\u201cBig Chu Missy, you\u2019re finally here! I\u2019ve been waiting for you all day.\u201d This middle-aged man was the second-in-charge at Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2014Yan Ge.Normally when people met him, they would have to call him \u2018Second Master\u2019 politely. Everyone knew that there was a mysterious power behind Zhen Bao Pavilion, so they knew not to offend them. They also knew that they had to have a very respectful attitude toward Yan Ge and Zhen Bao Pavilion.However, Yan Ge was extremely passionate toward Chu Liuyue today.Chu Liuyue smiled.\u201cIt seems like Second Master Yan is very pleased with yesterday\u2019s business deal.\u201dYan Ge laughed out loud. \u201cIt\u2019s all your hard work, Big Chu Missy.\u201dThat item had been placed in the store for quite a few years already. It was not that nobody liked it, but it was too expensive\u2014the price was literally asking for a hand and a leg. However, when Chu Liuyue came over the day before, she immediately said that the item could be sold.At the start, he still did not quite believe her, but in the morning, the Chu family and the Lu family respectively sent their money over.Now, when he saw Chu Liuyue again, it was akin to him seeing the God of Fortune.\u201cYesterday, you mentioned that there\u2019s still a good deal today. Why not\u2026\u201d Yan Ge rubbed his hands excitedly, and his eyes sparkled as he stared at Chu Liuyue.Chu Liuyue\u2019s fingers knocked on the table lightly. \u201cSecond Master Yan, I came here today, not to buy things, but to sell them.\u201dYan Ge was taken aback.Chu Liuyue took out a piece of paper from her sleeves and passed it to him.Yan Ge took the paper, and his eyes immediately widened in shock.Chu Liuyue said calmly, \u201cThree hundred thousand taels. I\u2019m not selling it for a lower price.\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Of course, he knew that he was not at a loss if he used 300,000 taels to exchange for this piece of paper. He would even profit quite a fair bit. However, the important thing was that this item was risky.\u201cBig Chu Missy, this\u2026 you\u2019ve really given me a hot potato.\u201d This was because this piece of paper was actually a title deed! Besides, it was not an ordinary title deed. It was the title deed for a hunting ground outside the Imperial City.The so-called hunting ground was actually a place specifically used to train fiends.In Mainland Xuan Wu, fiends were split into nine different levels\u2014where level one was the weakest, and level nine the strongest.Fiends had unreasonable personalities. They demanded freedom and would not be ordered around by people. However, once it made a vow with a human, they would be very loyal and become the human\u2019s capable assistant.Normally, a person could only establish a bond with one fiend. However, if the fiend died, humans could continue searching for other fiends to make another vow with.A higher level fiend was much stronger and could help humans even more. It was precisely because of this that the cultivators in Mainland Xuan Wu were all vying for fiends, especially ones that were of higher level. However, how could fiends be so easily found?An average cultivator could usually only venture into dangerous territories on their own, risking their lives to find fiends. However, it was different for families with authority. Since they usually chose to build their own hunting grounds.All they had to do was find a suitable place and gather a few fiends, which would save a lot of trouble for them. They could then allow their clans\u2019 disciples to choose any fiend they liked. They could even convert it into a training ground to strengthen the younger cultivators\u2019 capabilities.They would be more than happy to make this one move with multiple benefits. Although this sounded simple, it actually required a lot of effort and wealth to build a hunting ground.It was also because of this that only families with superior wealth could afford it, other than the royal family.Even the Chu family only had one hunting ground.Recently, the Chu family was gradually losing their power; it seemed like it would be hard for them to keep the hunting ground.Among the fiends there, the one with the highest cultivation was Jin Wanghu\u2014a level five fiend. He was a fiend the Chu family\u2019s master\u2014Chu Zhong\u2014had raised 20 years ago.However, the hunting ground title deed that Chu Liuyue produced was not the Chu family\u2019s, but her own\u2026The only reason why an invalid like her, who had been bullied multiple times, could have such a thing was because of her marriage agreement with the Crown Prince\u2014Rong Jin.When she was first born, Chu Ning was still the most outstanding talent from that Chu family\u2019s generation, and he faintly had the power to take over the Chu family. In addition to his fortitude and loyalty, he was well-loved by the Emperor, so once she was born, the Emperor immediately set up a marriage agreement between her and the Crown Prince.When she reached 14 years of age, they would officially be engaged, and she would become the Crown Princess.The hunting ground title deed was gifted to Chu Liuyue by the Emperor back then.At that time, Chu Liuyue had already become the envy of countless people when she was just an infant. However, who would have known she would be born an invalid\u2014she had a lacking Yuan meridian. From then on, she became Country Yao Chen\u2019s laughingstock.In a world where the strong were superior, the presence of weakness was a mistake on its own.When Chu Ning and his daughter fell into desolation, he did not forget about the hunting ground. However, in actual fact, it was long controlled by the Crown Prince. Chu Ning had asked to see the Crown Prince a few times to ask for help, but he was always ignored.Of course, he knew what it meant. Since then, he had no longer wished for anything more.The original Chu Liuyue always felt that she was not good enough for the Crown Prince, so she did not even think about it.It was a pity that the current Chu Liuyue was someone else.Her principle in life was very simple\u2014if one was kind to her, she would be a thousand-fold kinder; if one bullied her, she would definitely take her revenge and make that person suffer even more.It was impossible that the Crown Prince did not know what kind of lives her father and her were living, but he did not take any action at all. Then\u2026 what was the point of having the title deed?\u201cI know, so I came to find Second Master Yan. Why? Can Zhen Bao Pavilion not afford to accept this title deed?\u201d asked Chu Liuyue as she extended her hands to take back the paper as if she was disappointed.Second Master Yan hurriedly and carefully stowed the title deed into his sleeves and chuckled.\u201cJust listen to what you\u2019re saying! I don\u2019t dare to guarantee anything else, but in Country Yao Chen, there isn\u2019t any business that Zhen Bao Pavilion doesn\u2019t dare to take. Since you dare to send money to our door, we\u2019ll naturally dare to accept it.\u201dThe calm Chu Liuyue giggled. \u201cMy name\u2014Chu Liuyue\u2014is clearly written on the title deed. What wouldn\u2019t I dare to do?\u201dEveryone knew that this title deed was gifted to her by the Emperor. However, she was just an invalid now. No matter which aspect one looked at, she had no right to be the Crown Princess. If she had a bit of humility, she would take the initiative and return the title deed. However, why would Chu Liuyue do such a stupid thing?Since they were mean to her, she would do the same.Before she came, she had already found out that Zhen Bao Pavilion held a special status, and everyone in the Imperial City was very polite to them.Zhen Bao Pavilion was the only option as others would not dare to accept the title deed.Truly, it was just like what she had expected. Zhen Bao Pavilion really could take this business deal.Yan Ge sized the young girl in front of him in detail once again.This is weird, extremely weird\u2026 Rumors say that the Big Missy of the Chu family was born as an invalid, that she was weak and useless, and could even be bullied by the slaves in the Chu family. However, the person in front of me is clearly different.She is decisive, determined, generous, and calm. Even though her clothes are torn and tattered, her entire body exudes a strange distinguished aura. Her face still looks young, but one can tell that it reveals a rarely seen calm composure.He had only seen this aura in one person before\u2026\u201cHaha! Great! Our Zhen Bao Pavilion will accept this deal! Do you want it in banknotes or\u2026?\u201d Yan Ge rubbed his hands excitedly.That hunting ground contained quite a few fiends after the Crown Prince\u2019s meticulous care of it, and it was extremely valuable. This was a very profitable deal. However, Chu Liuyue shook her head.\u201cLet\u2019s not rush into things. I want to pick a few items first.\u201dYan Ge was taken aback and immediately said, \u201cWhat would you like? I\u2019ll immediately get someone to get it for you.\u201d At this point in time, he would no longer take the young girl in front of him as the rumored lowly invalid that could be bullied by anyone.Chu Liuyue\u2019s eyes sparkled slightly. \u201cI want a ten-year-old bamboo leaf, ice stone, Artemisia annua, 30-year-old hirsute shiny bugleweed, mulberry leaf\u2026\u201d As she spoke, she took out another piece of paper. \u201cJust prepare the items on the list for me.\u201dYan Ge took it and took a closer look in confusion. Initially, he thought that Chu Liuyue would pick a few valuable items, but he did not expect it to be these herbs. Some of them were quite common, but the items became increasingly valuable as he read through the list.\u201cHeh, don\u2019t worry. At any other place, they might not be able to give you everything that you want on this list, but our Zhen Bao Pavilion will definitely satisfy you!\u201dZhen Bao Pavilion dabbled in many trades, including medicine and herbs.\u201cHowever, these items are worth 20,000 silver taels when you add it up. As for the rest\u2026\u201dChu Liuyue\u2019s eyebrows raised slightly. \u201cJust give me 10,000 in banknotes. Second Master Yan, you can keep the rest since I want you to deliver the items on the list to me every three days.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Yan Ge, who experienced all sorts of scenes, could not help but widen his eyes.Two hundred thousand taels, which meant that he had to deliver the items on the list ten times in one short month!\u201cIs it difficult for you?\u201d\u201cNo, no! Not at all! Our Zhen Bao Pavilion will definitely not disappoint you. Just that\u2026 do you want me to deliver these items to the Chu family?\u201d asked Yan Ge tentatively.Chu Liuyue turned around and looked in a certain direction outside the window as she laughed with deeper meaning. \u201cOf course. I\u2019m the Big Missy of the Chu family; the items I buy naturally have to be officially delivered in from the main entrance.\u201dWant to spy on me? I\u2019ll let you look as long as you want!Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Also, they clearly said that it was for Chu Liuyue! Don\u2019t you think this is creepy?\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be\u2026 Everyone knows that Chu Liuyue is naturally an invalid. How can she be related to Zhen Bao Pavilion? It should be worth quite a bit of money for Zhen Bao Pavilion to give half a year\u2019s worth of herbs, right? Can she even afford it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I said that she went crazy! Zhen Bao Pavilion never makes a losing deal. Where do you think she got her money from? Could it be\u2026 from the Crown Prince?\u201d\u201cHah! The Crown Prince has never mentioned Chu Liuyue in so many years. Why would he do such a thing? He definitely wasn\u2019t the one who gave Chu Liuyue the money. She even bought herbs\u2026 Does she really think she can transform herself from an invalid to a talent just with all those herbs?\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201dEveryone in Imperial City was filled with sarcasm and was waiting to see Chu Liuyue\u2019s farce.\u2026In the Crown Prince\u2019s mansion\u2026In the study, a man wearing a dark purple robe was reading the documents on the table. He looked like he was in his early twenties; his features were sharp, and he was very handsome. His every move and action further brought out his distinguished aura.This person was none other than Country Yao Chen\u2019s respected Crown Prince\u2014Rong Jin.\u201cPrince, there seems to be a problem with the Chu family\u2026\u201d The Crown Prince\u2019s personal bodyguard\u2014Song Yuan\u2014carefully spoke.Rong Jin looked up. \u201cWhat can happen to the Chu family? Could it be Minmin\u2026\u201d Rong Jin realized something upon seeing Song Yuan\u2019s strange expression and squinted his eyes. \u201cSay it. What exactly happened?\u201dSong Yuan hurriedly reported the happenings between Chu Liuyue and Zhen Bao Pavilion to him in detail.\u201cI-I\u2026 have no idea where Big Chu Missy got all those silver taels from to afford so many herbs from Zhen Bao Pavilion.\u201dAll the herbs were contained in jade boxes and delivered over, so outsiders would not even know their contents. Even so, one could just randomly guess and know that the items inside would add up to an astronomical figure.Rong Jin knitted his brows and said in a frustrated tone, \u201cWhat the heck is she doing?\u201dIf it was not for that marriage agreement, why would he even care about that invalid? All these years, Chu Liuyue had not only been the Chu family\u2019s humiliation, but she was also a stain in his life that he could not get rid of. He felt disgusted once he thought about it.Uncertain, Song Yuan said, \u201cPrince, although Chu Ning has lost favor in recent years, he was once pretty powerful. It\u2019s not impossible for him to have some savings. The point is, why would they buy so many herbs? Perhaps\u2026\u201d\u201cHmph, she\u2019s just trying to solve her natural invalidity!\u201dThere was still a month left until the agreed engagement period on that marriage agreement. Was she still hallucinating and thinking of climbing her way up the ladder?\u201cRidiculous! In the entire Country Yao Chen, nobody could solve the problem of a lacking Yuan meridian. If they really had a solution, she would not have ended up in this state. She\u2019s not worth mentioning. This is just a farce. The palace will break off the marriage agreement with her sooner or later. In the meantime, the more important thing is\u2026 is Rong Xiu coming back?\u201dOnce Rong Xiu was mentioned, Song Yuan\u2019s expression changed, and he said softly, \u201cYes. They\u2019ll be reaching the Imperial City today. According to what I found out, Seventh Prince only brought two entourages with him, and they\u2019re coming back in simplicity.\u201dRong Jin chuckled. \u201cAt least he knows his place.\u201dAs Rong Xiu was naturally weak, he was different from the other princes. He was often taken to Mingyue Tianshan, which was miles away, to nurse himself back to health. He had only come back twice in so many years.It had already been three years since he had come back last time.Most of the people did not even take the Seventh Prince seriously; some didn\u2019t even remember his existence, but not Rong Jin, the Crown Prince. He was very alert about Rong Xiu\u2019s current return and had even sent people to follow him in secret.\u201cTell the subordinates to be more alert. If there\u2019s anything amiss, immediately report it to me!\u201d\u201cWill do!\u201d Even though Song Yuan did not know why the Crown Prince cared so much about the Seventh Prince, who was weak and powerless, he still immediately answered him. \u201cOh. Prince, a level five fiend has just arrived at the hunting ground. When would you like to go and take a look?\u201dAfter thinking for a while, a dim spark flashed across Rong Jin\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019ll be my birthday very soon. This year, I\u2019ll hold my birthday feast at the hunting ground.\u201d\u201cWill do!\u201d\u2026In the Chu family\u2026Half a year\u2019s worth of valuable herbs was ostentatiously delivered to Chu Liuyue and her father\u2019s yard.Chu Ning went out and had not returned yet, so Chu Liuyue brought the herbs bit by bit into the house alone.Very quickly, she discovered that the originally quiet and isolated yard had quite a few pairs of spying eyes.Chu Liuyue was very calm; she acted as if she did not know anything. Sometimes she would even open a jade box and check the herbs\u2019 quality.Zhen Bao Pavilion was indeed very meticulous toward her and had sent herbs of good quality.This was very helpful for her to get her Yuan meridian back.At this time, hurried footsteps sounds could be heard from outside the yard as a man loudly yelled, \u201cHurry! Capture Chu Liuyue!\u201dChu Liuyue sneered in her heart. They finally came. She looked up and saw that a bunch of people had already kicked open the door and rushed in.The man leading the pack looked ferocious, and there were more than ten strong and muscular men behind him. They looked like they were going to start a fight.Chu Liuyue squinted her eyes and finally recognized the man\u2014Chu Liansheng.This person was Chu Xianmin\u2019s trusted assistant. He was one of the culprits who had previously planned to kill the original Chu Liuyue.What a coincidence. I was just about to look for him, but he came and offered himself first instead.In no time, two men rushed toward Chu Liuyue.Chu Liuyue\u2019s gaze was as sharp as a knife as she yelled loudly, \u201cHow dare you! Who gave you the right to trespass into my place?\u201d Her questioning tone was strong and powerful, which immediately stunned everyone at the scene, causing them to stop their movements subconsciously.Chu Liansheng was also taken aback, but he immediately reacted over and said sarcastically, \u201cHah, Chu Liuyue, why do you think we\u2019re here? Don\u2019t you know? How can you afford such valuable herbs from Zhen Bao Pavilion? Your money must have come from doing illicit deeds! I advise you to be more honest. Obediently hand your things over and leave with us. If not, don\u2019t blame me for not being polite.\u201dUpon hearing that, Chu Liuyue surveyed her surroundings and put down the items in her hands. \u201cOh? Then what if I refuse?\u201dChu Liansheng was shocked and sneered afterward. \u201cWhat right do you have to say no?\u201d He sized Chu Liuyue up, his eyes filled with contempt. \u201cIt\u2019s already very humiliating for an invalid to freeload off the Chu family for so many years. Now, you\u2019ve used some disgraceful methods to buy all these items! Chu Liuyue, even if you don\u2019t want your reputation, the Chu family still wants ours!\u201dChu Liuyue looked at him calmly and walked forward. It seemed like she was going to give up without a fight.Chu Liansheng got increasingly cocky and glanced at the people around him. \u201cHurry up and confiscate the items! All of the items here are important evidence; none of them\u2026\u201dPiak!The sound of a loud smack cut across the air.The yard fell into deep silence.Chu Liuyue actually hit Chu Liansheng?!Everyone knew that he was Third Missy\u2014Chu Xianmin\u2019s trusted assistant. Anyone who saw him would normally give him some face. However, Chu Liuyue had completely lost her mind and even dared to hit him.\u201cYou! How dare you hit me?\u201d Chu Liansheng was shocked beyond words. The fiery pain on his face ignited his rage. \u201cYou must be tired of living!\u201d As he was talking, he subconsciously raised his hand and swung it toward Chu Liuyue.However, his hand could not land; his wrist was caught by Chu Liuyue instead. Then, she retaliated and gave him a second fierce slap.Piak!This time, she made Chu Liansheng\u2019s entire mouth bloody.Liked it?

How dare she slap Chu Liansheng twice?Chu Liansheng was the first one to react in this icy and embarrassing atmosphere. The fiery pain on his face and the bloody taste on his lips were all reminding him of what had just happened. \u201cYou b*tch! How dare you hit me?\u201dChu Liansheng\u2019s eyes widened in extreme anger, and he directly unsheathed the saber on his waist before ring towards Chu Liuyue ferociously.The sharp saber was just about to cut Chu Liuyue into two. When the saber landed, even if Chu Liuyue did not die, she would be crippled.However, Chu Liuyue did not move at all, but nodded and stared straight into Chu Liansheng\u2019s eyes. She enunciated her every word clearly, \u201cChu Liansheng, do you want to kill the Chu family\u2019s eldest daughter in front of everyone?\u201dThat one sentence was as if a lightning bolt zapped Chu Liansheng\u2019s ears. The words \u2018Chu family\u2019s eldest daughter\u2019 was like a curse that made him stop in his tracks.The tip of the blade was only inches away from Chu Liuyue.He subconsciously looked toward Chu Liuyue and met her black and silent eyes.At this moment, he actually felt a strong suppression that made people\u2019s hearts weaken. Chu Liuyue\u2019s gaze was like a sharp blade that cut across his body inch by inch.Shua!Chu Liansheng immediately cleared his head.Oh, right! Even though the skinny young girl in front of him was wearing torn and tattered clothes, she\u2026 was indeed the legitimate eldest daughter of the Chu family while he was just a servant that used Chu Xianmin\u2019s authority.\u201cThe first slap was because you didn\u2019t know your place.\u201d Chu Liuyue stepped forward.Chu Liansheng actually backed away subconsciously.\u201cThe second slap was because you committed insubordination.\u201d Chu Liuyue inched closer toward Chu Liansheng once again.Chu Liansheng\u2019s hand that was holding the knife trembled slightly.\u201cEven though I was born an invalid, the blood in my body is still the blood of the Chu family\u2019s first descendant. All these years, I\u2019ve kept my place and have not caused trouble at all. What about you? All of you started to bully me and humiliate me countless times. But have any of you ever thought of this? What rights do you have?\u201dChu Liuyue\u2019s repeated questioning finally made Chu Liansheng erupt as he rebutted, \u201cChu Liuyue! You\u2019re just a good-for-nothing from head to toe! You\u2019re the humiliation of the entire Chu family! How shameless must you be to say all of this? In this world, only the strong are respected. You deserve everything happening today!\u201d Even though his words were harsh, Chu Liansheng\u2019s voice was cracking slightly.He knew that nobody would care about it if he bullied Chu Liuyue privately, but it would be terrible if he had dragged the entire Chu family in.He was always careful in doing things. However, the Song Lian Trio\u2019s unknown fate made him anxious. Additionally, Chu Liuyue\u2019s actions that came one after another made him bring people over impulsively.He had never expected that the originally cowardly Chu Liuyue actually dared to retaliate.Upon hearing his words, Chu Liuyue\u2019s lips suddenly curved up, and she smiled. \u201cYes, I might be an invalid, but you seemed to have forgotten who my grandfather and my fianc\u00e9 are.\u201dChu Liansheng immediately broke out into a cold sweat. Chu Liuyue\u2019s grandfather was naturally the master of the Chu family, and her fianc\u00e9 was the Crown Prince.Even though everyone thought that Chu Liuyue had no chance of marrying the Crown Prince, the marriage agreement still existed after all. They could talk about these things in private, but absolutely nobody dared to say it to their faces.\u201cDid you call me a b*tch just now?\u201d Chu Liuyue smiled even more warmly. \u201cThen, are you scolding my grandfather and the Crown Prince?\u201dKuang!Chu Liansheng\u2019s saber fell to the ground. His legs turned into jelly; his face was pale, and he had almost collapsed onto the floor.Chu Liuyue, of course, did not care about her so-called grandfather or fianc\u00e9. If they had the slightest bit of sympathy or care for her, the original Chu Liuyue would not have ended up in this state. However, it was still okay to make use of them at this stage.\u201cI-I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d stammered Chu Liansheng. If word of this incident got out, no matter if it was the Crown Prince or the Chu family, he wouldn\u2019t be let off, even if it was just to maintain their reputation.Chu Liuyue said calmly, \u201cNow, are you going to cut off your right arm and pay for your sins, or\u2026 do you want me to get my grandfather and the Crown Prince to uphold justice for me?\u201dChu Liansheng was shocked. Chu Liuyue actually wanted him to pay such a painful price!Cutting off his right arm on his own\u2026 That would mean that his entire cultivating career would be ruined!He clenched his teeth and secretly glanced at the people around him. Now, he needed to stall for time and wait for Third Missy to appear.\u201cSince you can\u2019t do it yourself, then, I\u2019ll do it for you!\u201d Chu Liuyue did not even give him time to react as she moved at lightning speed to pick up the saber from the floor and chop down mercilessly.Chu Liansheng was a stage three warrior; logically speaking, he could have avoided Chu Liuyue\u2019s strike. However, for some reason, when the brandished saber cut through the air, he didn\u2019t even see Chu Liuyue\u2019s actions clearly!Tch!Chu Liansheng\u2019s right arm was cut off there and then.Blood spurted everywhere.\u201cAh!\u201d Chu Liansheng let out painful screams when the excruciating pain hit him.Everyone\u2019s hearts trembled as they stole glances at Chu Liuyue.That skinny young girl stood there with her back straight as she held the saber calmly.It was as if she had just cut down a tree branch and not someone\u2019s right arm.This made them even more afraid. Chu Liuyue had really changed into someone else! Even the people who were originally surrounding Chu Liuyue had canceled their plans to bully her after seeing the scene play out.What a joke! She had just made use of the Chu family master and the Crown Prince. Who would dare to go against her?Someone hesitated and wondered if he should help Chu Liansheng up, but he did not dare to step forward.What if Chu Liuyue went crazy and cut them too?At this point, everyone was still in utter shock; nobody thought about how an invalid like Chu Liuyue could defeat Chu Liansheng.Chu Liuyue casually threw the saber onto the floor, and it rolled beside Chu Liansheng\u2019s cut arm. The fresh blood was still dripping from it; it was very bloody and scary.\u201cGet lost!\u201d As she said that, she turned around and walked towards the pile of herbs in her yard.Today\u2019s incident was just a warning to the rest of them. She must make all of these people suffer 100 times more and pay for all the sufferings and grievances the original Chu Liuyue had gone through.What could a 200,000 silver tael debt amount to?What could a broken arm amount to?Compared to Chu Liuyue\u2019s life, these were nothing.In and outside of the yard, the crowd looked at each other dazedly.Originally, they wanted to watch Chu Liuyue\u2019s farce play out, but they did not expect\u2026At this time, familiar footsteps sounded from the outside.A woman shrieked loudly in shock. \u201cLiansheng! What happened to you?\u201dThe crowd turned around; their faces were filled with excitement once more.The person who came was none other Than Chu Liansheng\u2019s master\u2014Third Missy Chu Xianmin.Chu Xianmin had lost out previously; she was very indignant every time she thought about it, so she did not want to let Chu Liuyue live peacefully and sent Chu Liansheng over.On the one hand, she wanted to find out what kind of herbs Chu Liuyue bought, and on the other, she wanted to take the chance to teach Chu Liuyue a lesson. However, she did not expect for her subordinates to pass on words that a problem had cropped up halfway through the plan.She hurriedly rushed over and saw Chu Liansheng lying on the floor and groaning in pain, while his right arm had been cut.Chu Liansheng moaned non-stop as he crawled over and bawled loudly. \u201cThird Missy! Third Missy, you must uphold justice for me! That b*t- Big Missy has cut off my right arm!\u201dChu Xianmin\u2019s blood boiled instantly. Everyone knew that Chu Liansheng was her servant. Chu Liuyue\u2019s actions were akin to slapping her in the face.She glared at Chu Liuyue and tried her best to suppress the anger in her heart. \u201cSister, may I know what is going on? Shouldn\u2019t you give me an explanation?\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why are you so angry? Could it be that in your eyes, your elder sister can\u2019t even be compared to a slave?\u201dYou should have considered whose slave he was! Chu Xianmin was furious. If it weren\u2019t for the rather large group of people watching them, she would definitely not be able to contain her anger, and would directly go up and confront Chu Liuyue.She took a deep breath and forced a smile.\u201cSister, your status is definitely more precious than theirs, but as the saying goes, \u2018look at the owner before you hit the dog.\u2019 Sister, you clearly knew that Liansheng is my servant. Why must you treat him in this way? That one cut of yours directly destroyed his cultivating career.\u201dIt looked like she really wanted to stand up for her people.The crowd could not help but compare both people in their hearts as they watched the commotion.Chu Xianmin was extremely talented, but she did not put up an act and was gentle and mature. She was clearly angry and frustrated beyond words at this point. One could tell that she cared very much about her servants.This point alone made people admire her.On the other hand, Chu Liuyue was very arrogant as an invalid. She was just like a maniac!Chu Liuyue suddenly realized something. \u201cOh\u2026 right. I actually forgot that he\u2019s your servant.\u201dChu Xianmin was furious to the point she almost spat out blood. Chu Liuyue was clearly acting in front of her. If she did not stand up for Chu Liansheng today, everyone would know that Chu Xianmin was trampled all over by an invalid when word got out.What kind of reputation would she be left with?\u201cSince Sister remembered it, then no matter what, may I ask\u2026\u201dBefore Chu Xianmin could finish her sentence, Chu Liuyue interrupted her. \u201cIn other words, you were the one who asked him to come and wreak havoc at my place?\u201dChu Xianmin was suddenly stumped.\u201cYou commanded Chu Liansheng to bring people to capture me and snatch my herbs away, right?\u201d\u201cW-why\u2026 would I\u2026?\u201d Chu Xianmin subconsciously denied it.However, Chu Liuyue refused to believe her. \u201cWithout your instructions, why would Chu Liansheng dare to do that?\u201dHer one sentence made Chu Xianmin speechless.The entire area fell into a deep silence as everyone watched the good show.Chu Liansheng was very smart. He knew that if he let Chu Liuyue continue, it would not be good for them at all, so he hurriedly yelled, \u201cThird Missy, it\u2019s all my fault! Big Missy is a distinguished person; I shouldn\u2019t have offended her. If Big Missy insists on telling Master or the Crown Prince, I\u2019ll bear all the consequences on my own.\u201dChu Xianmin\u2019s face contorted. Chu Liuyue was using her marriage agreement with the Crown Prince to pressure her.What exactly happened? Chu Liuyue long knew that she wasn\u2019t good enough for the Crown Prince, so she was too ashamed to bring the marriage agreement up. Why would she\u2026?\u201cWhat\u2019s all the commotion about?\u201d An angry roar suddenly sounded.Chu Xianmin was elated to hear this voice as she turned around to take a look.\u201cFirst Elder!\u201d Chu Liuyue looked up and saw First Elder\u2014Chu Xiao\u2014walking towards them.An unfamiliar man was following closely behind him.\u201cI told him to come. Why? Do you have an issue with it?\u201d Chu Xiao stood in front of Chu Xianmin and knitted his brows toward Chu Liuyue. He did not even attempt to hide his hatred in his voice.Chu Xianmin was calmed. Actually, First Elder did not know anything about this issue, but she was more than happy since he was willing to take her side.Her heart was much more composed than before as she smiled and greeted the man behind the First Elder. \u201cVice-Captain Song, why are you here?\u201dThe person was precisely the Crown Prince\u2019s personal bodyguard\u2014Song Yuan.Song Yuan hurriedly bowed and greeted smartly, \u201cThird Missy, you\u2019re too kind. I came here to pass something to you.\u201dOne could just think a little to know that he was acting on the Crown Prince\u2019s orders to give something to Chu Xianmin.The expressions on the crowds\u2019 faces changed.They had long heard that the Crown Prince liked Chu Xianmin, and now it seemed like it was true.Chu Xianmin was also very pleased; the numerous envious looks from the crowd comforted her heart more than ever. Her cheeks blushed as if she was shy. \u201cIf Brother Jin wanted to give me something, he could just send anyone over. He shouldn\u2019t have troubled Vice-Captain Song to deliver the item over personally.\u201dSong Yuan took out a letter and passed it to her with both his hands. He said happily, \u201cThe Crown Prince\u2019s birthday party is coming soon. I came here specifically to pass you the invitation card. Of course, there are people who will deliver the cards for the others, but the Crown Prince had specially instructed me to pass you the card personally.\u201dThe crowd then realized that it was the Crown Prince\u2019s birthday party invitation. It was normal for the Crown Prince to invite guests to his party, but only a handful of people would receive the invitation from Song Yuan. This showed that he really treated Chu Xianmin differently.\u201cI see. Thank you, Vice-Captain Song.\u201d Chu Xianmin took the invitation card and was extremely pleased and elated in her heart. She knew that the Crown Prince liked her, but his previous attitude was always quite ambiguous. Now, he was finally willing to show it clearly.Very soon, everyone in the Imperial City would know about this incident.The Crown Prince had the intent to make her the Crown Princess.She took the invitation card and purposely asked Chu Liuyue, \u201cSister, I heard that your engagement with Brother Jin is going to happen really soon. You must have received the invitation card much earlier, right?\u201dThe crowd erupted into chuckles.Invitation card?The Crown Prince must probably have forgotten about her.Chu Xianmin said very sincerely, \u201cYou\u2019ve never gone to any of Brother Jin\u2019s birthday parties in the past few years. You are going this year, right?\u201dChu Liuyue sneered.In the past, Rong Jin did invite the original Chu Liuyue to attend his birthday party, and she did attend it with high expectations. However, she only received countless scoldings and mockery in return.From then on, she refused to go, and Rong Jin naturally did not invite her anymore.This time, there would definitely not be an invitation card for her as well.Chu Xianmin covered her mouth in shock. \u201cAhh! Could it be that you don\u2019t have it? T-this\u2026\u201d She looked at the invitation card in her hands as if in a difficult position. \u201cSorry, Sister. I didn\u2019t know that you didn\u2019t have\u2026\u201dFirst Elder stroked his beard in satisfaction. Chu Liuyue that invalid almost ruined the marriage alliance between the Chu family and the Crown Prince. Luckily the Crown Prince has set his eyes on Minmin. Thinking about this, he looked at Chu Liuyue with a cold face.\u201cWhy would an invalid like her go? To humiliate herself? Hurry up and kneel down!\u201dChu Liuyue looked at him coldly. \u201cFirst Elder, shouldn\u2019t you give me a reason for that?\u201dFirst Elder knitted his brows tightly as he pointed towards the herbs and his voice boomed. \u201cYou still have the guts to ask? Say it! Where did you get the money to buy all these items?\u201dSong Yuan looked at Chu Liuyue.Was\u2026 this the rumored invalid of the Chu family\u2014Chu Liuyue?He had never taken any notice of her in the past, and the Crown Prince did not even know what she looked like. Unexpectedly, she started to become out of place at this juncture.How ridiculous.Chu Xianmin started to feel uneasy when she saw Song Yuan\u2019s gaze land on Chu Liuyue.Song Lian was Song Yuan\u2019s cousin, and he had initially helped pave the way for her, which the Crown Prince might not even know about.Even though he had never stated his stance, his attitude showed that he silently agreed with his actions. However, Song Yuan still did not know about Song Lian\u2019s precarious situation.If he knew\u2026Chu Liuyue kept quiet for a while; when the crowd thought that she was about to admit her wrongs, she suddenly glanced at Song Yuan. Then, she spoke in a seemingly laughing manner, \u201cFirst Elder, where do you think I got so much money from? There aren\u2019t many people who would do this in the entire Imperial City.\u201dJust as the First Elder was about to continue scolding her, he was suddenly stunned.Did Chu Liuyue mean that the Crown Prince gave her the money?He looked at Song Yuan with uncertainty.Song Yuan was also dazed.Why would the Crown Prince ever give her money? However, there seemed to be no other explanation other than this.\u201cThird Sister, you don\u2019t have to feel guilty. I won\u2019t be going to the Crown Prince\u2019s birthday party this year.\u201dThe moment a tinge of happiness flashed across Chu Xianmin\u2019s eyes, she heard the next sentence that Chu Liuyue said.\u201cAfter all, the engagement is just around the corner, and I have lots to prepare. How can I be as free as you, right?\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What a b*tch!\u201d Chu Xianmin stormed back into her room angrily, and her mind kept replaying the words that Chu Liuyue had said before, which made her grit her teeth in anger.What engagement? She was clearly doing it on purpose! Chu Xianmin felt a fireball growing in her chest when she thought of Chu Liuyue\u2019s nonchalant expression.Piak!She slammed her door shut.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d A woman\u2019s voice suddenly came from within the house. Chu Xianmin looked up and after seeing who the person was, and instantly ran over with grievances.\u201cMother! You must stand up for me this time! Your daughter is being bullied so badly by that b*tch!\u201dThis woman was Chu Xianmin\u2019s real mother\u2014Lu Yao. Although she was well past her thirties, she had maintained her looks very well and still looked beautiful as ever; her every move was very coquettish.Lu Yao normally doted on her only daughter very much, but this time, her face did not look like she cared about Chu Xianmin\u2019s cries at all. She even looked quite displeased.\u201cI\u2019ve only not been home for a few days, and you\u2019ve already caused so much trouble You really disappoint me. That Chu Liuyue is just a good-for-nothing that can\u2019t even present herself properly. What tricks can she have up her sleeves? How can you be played by her?\u201dChu Xianmin rarely saw her mother\u2019s stern expression, and she could not help but stand straight. However, her heart felt even worse. \u201cMother, you have no idea. It\u2019s as if this Chu Liuyue has changed into someone completely different; her recent actions are extremely weird. It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t win against her, she\u2019s just too cunning!\u201dOnce Chu Xianmin thought of her losses in front of Chu Liuyue these few days, she could not help but clench her teeth.\u201cNot talking about the 200,000 silver taels she took from me. Today, she even used her wedding agreement with the Crown Prince to pressure me.\u201dLu Yao knitted her brows and was quite unhappy. \u201cSpeaking of this, I didn\u2019t even have the chance to talk to you about it. What exactly happened to those 200,000 silver taels? Even though the Lu family has money, I\u2019m no longer a part of them, let alone to ask for so much in one shot.\u201dChu Xianmin was pretty guilty, and she tried to explain the incident tactfully. Looking at Lu Yao\u2019s increasingly contorted expression, Chu Xianmin\u2019s eyes turned, and she hurriedly whined, \u201cMother, don\u2019t grandfather and the rest like me a lot? They will help me, right?\u201d\u201cBut this is still too much!\u201d Lu Yao looked away; she was very frustrated. Even though she was part of the Lu family, she was a concubine\u2019s daughter and did not have a high status. The Chu family she married into was also becoming increasingly desolated.All these years, the mother-daughter duo could only raise their heads in the Lu family because Chu Xianmin was outstanding enough. However, the Lu family would definitely treat her as a laughingstock if she asked for 200,000 silver taels in one go.Lu Yao looked at her own daughter from the corner of her eye and saw that she was not looking too well either. She stretched out her hand and patted Chu Xianmin\u2019s head.\u201cYou, sigh\u2026 You should think about why people like you! It\u2019s because you\u2019re very talented and you have the Crown Prince\u2019s favor. If not, who would care about you? Let me ask you, can you be at the top of your level at school in a month?\u201dChu Xianmin said nonchalantly, \u201cOf course!\u201d Her talent was one of the best in the entire Country Yao Chen. \u201cBut, the problem now is the marriage agreement between the Crown Prince and that b*tch.\u201dLu Yao did not care much about that, and she smiled with deeper meaning. \u201cSilly kid, what are you worried about? The one who doesn\u2019t want this marriage agreement to come true the most isn\u2019t you, but the Crown Prince! You can let her tease you these few days, but at that time, she\u2019ll have her own retribution.\u201d\u2026Chu Liuyue talking about her marriage agreement with the Crown Prince had indeed shocked everyone and successfully stumped First Elder and the rest, causing those people who wanted to see her farce leave in anger.When the yard was quiet once again, she finally brought all the herbs into the house and found a big black pot to start cooking.If she had the ability, she would not have to spend so much effort. Instead, she could directly use her force to churn up a fireball to boil the herbs. It was a pity that her cultivation was limited, and she could only use the most traditional method.Although this caused the herbs\u2019 effectiveness to be reduced, she had ordered ten sets of these herbs from Zhen Bao Pavilion, so it would probably be enough in the end.She put the herbs in one by one when the water started to boil.Very quickly, a fresh herbal smell started to permeate the air.Since each herb had different natures, the boiling times required to refine them were also different.She calculated the timing seriously; she carefully took out the herbs that had already been refined, and poured the remaining herbs in bit by bit.The color of the soup kept changing thereafter. The smell of the herbs had also become stronger.Chu Liuyue took a deep breath and instantly felt a warm air rushing throughout her body, making her much more relaxed than before.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look bad,\u201d she muttered to herself.As the princess of the Tianling Dynasty and having the cultivation talent to become an imperial doctor, Chu Liuyue had read all the medical books she could get her hands on in her previous life.As long as she had sufficient herbs, repairing her Yuan meridian posed no difficulty to her.\u201cYue\u2019er!\u201d Chu Ning\u2019s nervous shout could be heard from the door.Chu Liuyue walked over to open the door strangely and saw Chu Ning walking over at top speed.As he was in a hurry, he did not even care about his injured leg as he wobbled over in a staggering manner.\u201cFather, why did you come back so early today?\u201d Chu Liuyue asked curiously.Ever since Chu Ning was injured, he was sent to one of the Chu family\u2019s stores to work; he usually would not return home until late at night.\u201cYue\u2019er! A-are you okay?\u201dChu Liuyue suddenly realized what happened. It seemed like Chu Ning had found out about the incident earlier. If not, he would definitely not have such a reaction.She smiled brightly. \u201cFather, you\u2019re too worried about me. It\u2019s only been half a day. What could possibly happen? Quickly, come in and rest.\u201d As she spoke, she went over to hold him.However, Chu Ning grabbed her hand and stared at her sternly as he hesitated to speak. He had heard that something happened to Yue\u2019er earlier when he was working at the shop, so he hurriedly asked for leave and rushed back.The moment he entered the yard, he saw the scary pool of blood on the ground.Looking at his daughter\u2019s relaxed look, Chu Ning was even more solemn and subconsciously used even more strength to grip Chu Liuyue\u2019s wrist.\u201cYue\u2019er, d-did you really cut off Chu Liansheng\u2019s arm?\u201dChu Liuyue calmly nodded her head without a change in expression. \u201cYes. He wanted to steal my things. I can\u2019t let anyone bully me. Cutting off his arm was just a warning to the rest.\u201dChu Ning took a really long time to open his mouth with much difficulty. \u201cH-he\u2019s Chu Xianmin\u2019s servant\u2026 Your actions are clearly pitting yourself against her. She\u2026\u201d She is not someone that is easy to deal with!Chu Liuyue\u2019s hand started to hurt from Chu Ning\u2019s grip, so she patted his arm and comforted him. \u201cFather, what\u2019s the point of thinking so much? If I didn\u2019t do that, would she really treat me as her elder sister?\u201dChu Ning was stumped. Yes, Chu Xianmin was the one who wanted to destroy Yue\u2019er the most because of her marriage agreement with the Crown Prince.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018but.\u2019 Father, don\u2019t worry. I know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d said Chu Liuyue as she lifted her chin towards the inside of the house and smiled. \u201cOh, yes. I\u2019ve recently come across a folk prescription that is said to be good for body recovery. Do you want to try it?\u201dWhen she was boiling the herbs for herself, she did not forget about Chu Ning\u2019s injury. She had secretly taken his pulse before. If he was treated properly, he could recover completely in less than half a month.While talking, she pulled Chu Ning into the house.Chu Ning did not budge. He was very familiar with the face of the young girl in front of him, but why did he feel so unfamiliar with her at this very moment? The next moment, he finally asked with trembling lips, \u201cYou\u2019re not Yue\u2019er, are you?\u201dLiked it?

She asked weirdly, \u201cFather, what are you talking about?\u201d Her confused expression did not allow others to suspect her.However\u2026 Chu Ning was very conflicted, and he kept replaying his memories of the past two days.Everything seemed to be very different ever since Yue\u2019er went missing when she was picking herbs the day before and came back very late. The previously cowardly Yue\u2019er was missing and was replaced by a calm and composed young lady.When she stood up against First Elder and Chu Xianmin, he thought she was wronged and could not hold it back in, but the incidents that happened later were way overboard.\u201cIn the past, Yue\u2019er always thought of Chu Xianmin as her good sister and trusted her very much. Why would she go against her today? Besides, Yue\u2019er is very timid and doesn\u2019t even dare to talk loudly. It\u2019s impossible that she will cut off someone\u2019s arm\u2026 Also, about the herbs from Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2026 I\u2019ve never given you silver taels. How did you buy them?\u201d The more Chu Ning spoke, the guiltier he felt; his voice was even trembling.Initially, he felt that something was not quite right, but everything was questionable upon deeper thought.Chu Liuyue quietly waited for him to finish talking, before asking softly, \u201cIs there anything else? Other than all of these, do you have any other queries?\u201dChu Ning shook his head. Weren\u2019t these suspicions enough?\u201cI know that I look like I\u2019ve changed into someone else in the past two days, but it\u2019s all with good reason. I don\u2019t care about other people, but I\u2019ll explain it to you clearly since you\u2019re suspicious.\u201d Chu Liuyue held his hands warmly and determinedly. \u201cCome in; I\u2019ll explain it to you in detail.\u201dChu Ning subconsciously followed her in.After Chu Ning sat down, Chu Liuyue closed the door and went to check on the boiling herbs before adding two new ingredients in.Watching her every move, Chu Ning was more certain of his suspicions. The past Yue\u2019er did not know any of this. It probably has to be\u2026\u201cI think you\u2019ve roughly guessed that I did meet with some trouble the day I came back late. Chu Xianmin had secretly sent an assassin to kill me.\u201d The moment Chu Liuyue opened her mouth, it shocked Chu Ning so much that he stood up from his seat.\u201cWhat?!\u201d He had guessed a tiny bit about what happened, but he did not expect Chu Xianmin to be so cold-blooded to hire an assassin directly.Chu Liuyue looked at him and nodded seriously. She then explained the incidents that happened after that to him in detail. Of course, she cleverly hid the fact that the original Chu Liuyue had already died and she was a replacement.She had the original Chu Liuyue\u2019s memories; by mixing in her lies with the truth, there would be no loopholes.To Chu Ning, he realized that Chu Xianmin had tried to kill Yue\u2019er because of her selfish intentions.\u201c\u2026 So from then on, I saw her true intentions and finally understood that repeated tolerance can never be exchanged for peaceful days. Only when I become stronger will others not bully me.\u201dChu Ning did not utter a word for a long time. Oh, right! I know this logic too. It was just that I\u2019m severely ill and can\u2019t continue cultivating. What else could I do?\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault for being useless\u2026\u201d mumbled Chu Ning as he lowered his head defeatedly.Chu Liuyue shook her head and said, \u201cFather, do you remember the time when I went to the Crown Prince\u2019s birthday party and was bullied by everyone? I came home crying, and you insisted on meeting the Emperor. You stood up for me by getting all of those people to apologize to me. Without you, I would\u2019ve been bullied to no end.\u201dAt that time, Chu Ning\u2019s status was already no longer like before; one could just tell how hard it had been for him to get everyone to apologize.Even if those people\u2019s attitudes were fake, it was enough to prove that Chu Ning could sacrifice everything for his daughter.Chu Ning was touched; he raised his head slowly as if in slight disbelief.Chu Liuyue gave him one last assurance. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me that you\u2019ll do your best to protect me if I\u2019m ever bullied, no matter in the past or future? Right?\u201dChu Ning\u2019s eyes immediately turned red. He did indeed tell Yue\u2019er that in the past. His voice started to crack. \u201cYue\u2019er\u2026 My Yue\u2019er!\u201d The person in front of him was still his daughter!Chu Liuyue\u2019s eyes started to water. What does it feel like for a father to lose his own daughter? When I died back then, perhaps Father\u2026She always thought of her own father when she looked at Chu Ning. Since she was going to live as Chu Liuyue, she would naturally treat Chu Ning nicely and not let the world have another devastated father.Her personality was vastly different from the original Chu Liuyue\u2019s; thus, it became much easier for her to complete her tasks in the future now that everything was out in the open.Wasn\u2019t it normal to have a drastic change in personality after having a brush with death?A moment later, Chu Ning clenched his fists and gritted his teeth. \u201cChu Xianmin is outrageous! I must think of a way for her to pay!\u201dChu Liuyue\u2019s eyes flashed, and she took the chance to say, \u201cFather, actually her actions helped me instead. I found a chance in Lin Zhong unknowingly\u2026 I picked up a medical book.\u201dChu Ning was very surprised. \u201cMedical book? Do you understand it?\u201dOne had to know that it was very hard to understand medical books; it was impossible for an average person to self-learn medicine. Even with a specialized teacher aiding them, one might not be able to understand anything.However, Yue\u2019er\u2026Chu Liuyue nodded. \u201cI can only understand a little, so I wanted to try the remedy in the book. It seemed pretty simple.\u201d Chu Liuyue did not even bat an eye when she told her lie.In actual fact, most medical books were pretty simple to her.Chu Ning slowly looked at the pot of boiling herbs and suddenly walked over.The color of the soup was accurate, and the strong smell in the air was clean.Although he didn\u2019t know much about medicine, he had seen quite a lot of things in life and knew that it was not easy to cook such a perfect bowl of herbs.The order of the herbs that were put in, the quantity of the herbs, and the method of removing the residues\u2026 All of these things were equally important.It was only Yue\u2019er\u2019s first time trying, yet she could easily boil such a soup\u2026A thought flashed across his mind, which made him excited. He looked at Chu Liuyue anxiously. \u201cYue\u2019er, is this really your first time trying?\u201dChu Liuyue blinked. \u201cYeah. Why, Father? Is there anything wrong?\u201dOf course, there\u2019s something wrong! This is unbelievable! This proves that Yue\u2019er possibly has the gift to become a heavenly doctor. Her Yuan meridian is blocked, and she can\u2019t cultivate. However, if she can become a heavenly doctor\u2026 No, if she has the slightest bit of talent, things will be very different.Chu Ning had literally risen from hell to heaven, and he was extremely excited and emotional. If this was true, then nobody would dare to bully Chu Liuyue any longer.\u201cYue\u2019er, follow me to visit a person tomorrow.\u201dThere were very few heavenly doctors in Country Yao Chen; he was on good terms with one of them. He should let that person check if Yue\u2019er really had the talent in this area.Chu Liuyue naturally knew what he was thinking. After considering for a while, she said, \u201cFather, why don\u2019t we calm down first? This might attract too much attention.\u201dChu Ning was dazed.That was true. If they went over now, someone would definitely come and cause trouble.\u201cLet\u2019s wait for a while.\u201d He could also see if the herbs Yue\u2019er tried to boil really were useful.He felt much more secure after he thought of this.\u201cOh, right. Yue\u2019er, how did you escape from those people that day?\u201dChu Liuyue was taken aback. She could not say that she was too capable in her previous life, and that stage three warriors weren\u2019t her match even without force. Her eyes turned, and the image of a muscular man appeared in her brain.The seemingly visible lines painted a mesmerizing picture.She opened a jade box and said casually, \u201cOh, I met the Seventh Prince coincidentally that day, and he helped me.\u201dChu Ning was stunned. \u201cSeventh Prince? Is he not recuperating at Mingyue Tianshan? When did he return to the Imperial City?\u201dChu Liuyue froze.Liked it?

    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: Who was Spying?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosChu Liuyue suddenly remembered that the Seventh Prince\u2014Rong Xiu\u2014had indeed left the Imperial City earlier on since he was not in good health. He had only returned once or twice in all these years.Even some court officials did not really take the Seventh Prince, Rong Xiu, seriously, let alone the original Chu Liuyue\u2014a small character that got bullied all day long in her residence.There were only a pitiful few memories related to the Seventh Prince, Rong Xiu, in the original Chu Liuyue\u2019s brain, so Chu Liuyue did not even realize that he wasn\u2019t supposed to be in the Imperial City.\u201cBut I\u2019ve heard that the Seventh Prince is coming back\u2026 Yue\u2019er, did you say that you met the Seventh Prince at Lin Zhong?\u201d asked Chu Zhong curiously.Chu Liuyue let out a sigh of relief secretly and took advantage of the situation. \u201cYeah! I was also wondering about that then. I didn\u2019t expect to meet him so coincidentally just as he came back.\u201d\u201cNo wonder\u2026 It seems like the Seventh Prince has really come back. However, there hasn\u2019t been much news in the Imperial City.\u201d Chu Ning thought for a while as he knitted his brows, but did not care about this incident much. After all, Rong Xiu was part of the royal family, and he had his own logic in doing things.Now that he was no longer in court and was away from all these disputes, there was no use to think about this further.He caressed Chu Liuyue\u2019s head dotingly. \u201cThis time, we really owe the Seventh Prince a big favor. If there\u2019s a chance, I\u2019ll definitely thank him in person.\u201dChu Liuyue disagreed silently. What favor? I just made use of his Lake Bibo for a while. However, looking at Chu Ning\u2019s assured expression, she did not explain further and shifted the topic to the boiling herbs.\u201cFather, I boiled this according to the formula. I heard that it\u2019s useful for old injuries. Try it!\u201d said Chu Liuyue as she scooped out a bowl of medicine and opened the jade box next to her to take out a one-inch-long red rhizome that was as thick as a thumb. She squeezed it hard, and red juice dripped into the medicine.Chu Liuyue then passed the bowl to Chu Ning.Chu Ning looked down at the light-red medicine and was rather unsure. \u201cYue\u2019er, is this really useful?\u201dChu Liuyue naturally knew what he was worried about. Nobody could be confident about an ignorant person boiling herbs for the first time.He did not hope for the herbs to be effective; he just hoped that it wasn\u2019t poisonous.She could only let him try the medicine directly since she could not tell Chu Ning her real identity. She also could not say that his old injury was just a small case in her eyes.\u201cYue\u2019er, did you properly prepare this according to the medical book\u2019s formula\u2026?\u201dChu Liuyue was just about to explain, but Chu Ning had already taken the bowl from her hands. He chuckled. \u201cSince Yue\u2019er spent so much effort to make this for me, I can\u2019t let your goodwill go to waste.\u201d As he spoke, he directly finished the bowl of medicine in one go.When he was done, he even showed the empty bowl to Chu Liuyue. \u201cLook! I\u2019ve finished every single drop!\u201d Even if everyone in the world wanted to harm him, Yue\u2019er would not. Even if he was not sure what effects this bowl of medicine had, he still drank it willingly because this was his precious daughter.Chu Liuyue was dazed as she looked at Chu Ning\u2019s delighted face, and asked subconsciously, \u201cThis is my first time making this medicine. I don\u2019t have any experience at all. Father, aren\u2019t you afraid you\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you have experience now? With me here, you will never have to worry! You can do whatever you want.\u201dChu Liuyue felt her heart tingle as her entire body warmed up. Her heart was already frozen solid; even her bones and blood were cold after going through the painstaking betrayal in her past life. However, her heart warmed as she stared at Chu Ning\u2019s loving smile. She looked down and wiped away the tears in her eyes. After some time, she finally spoke. \u201cFather, you will get better!\u201dChu Ning was in a daze, but he heard her every word clearly.\u201cOne day in the future, Father, you\u2019ll be as strong as you were before! No, you\u2019ll become even stronger!\u201dChu Ning laughed bitterly in his heart. Be stronger than in the past?His leg was already\u2026 incurable. He could no longer advance in his cultivation. It was easy to say those words, but not easy to accomplish it. However, he could not bear to hurt his daughter, so he squeezed Chu Liuyue\u2019s cheeks with a smile and asked, \u201cOh, yeah. The money for the herbs\u2026\u201dChu Liuyue\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cThe Crown Prince gave me the money. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dChu Ning did not quite believe what Chu Liuyue said, but he did not probe further after seeing her confident expression and left after some instructions. After all, he had come back on leave. Since his daughter was fine, he should return to work.Chu Liuyue waited for him to leave before continuing to boil her herbs.Chu Ning\u2019s injury was not a big problem; it only required her to boil a few herbs for two hours. The next medicine was the star of the show.\u2026Time flew past quickly, and it was already nighttime.The herbal smell in the house became even stronger. Even though she closed the windows and doors, the yard was still filled with the strong fragrance that strengthened one\u2019s heart. However, as they were in an isolated corner of the estate and with this morning\u2019s drama, none of the Chu family members would step foot into this place.The moon hung high in the sky.It was completely silent inside and outside the house.Chu Liuyue poured all the medicine into the wood container for showering that she had already prepared at the side. The fragrance of the herbs and the rising heat merged together and permeated the air.She then undid her belt and prepared to take off her clothes. Even though she was very skinny, she already had some of a young woman\u2019s curves.Her clothes dropped on the floor, revealing her white, pearly shoulders.Dong!She heard a loud sound coming from outside.Chu Liuyue rapidly put on her clothes, went to the windows to open them, and took a look outside. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201dThe yard was deadly silent; she could vaguely see a white figure flash past a distant wall.When she was about to take a closer look, the figure disappeared into thin air.She alertly waited for a while, and only stopped looking when there were no more sounds. Just as she was about to lock the windows securely, a thought flashed in her mind. Did Xue Xue come back? Other than this, she really could not think of anyone else who would be here.But why did it leave?After thinking for a while, Chu Liuyue closed the window but did not lock it.If it came back, it could come in from the window.After doing all of this, she took off her clothes again and finally entered the bath.The hot power followed her skin, and ferociously entered her body.Chu Liuyue\u2019s face immediately flushed red as all the blood rushed to her face. It was hard for her body to take such a strong surge of energy since her body\u2019s Yuan meridian was lacking, and she was very weak.Chu Liuyue opened the last jade box at the side and took out the jade-green cold pearl that was as big as a longan before placing it in her mouth.A cold air that chilled her heart immediately went into her lungs.Her body started to prick and hurt everywhere.Cold on the outside, warm on the inside. She felt like she was being attacked by ice and fire at the same time. However, her Yuan meridian could only be revived and recovered through this strong and intense shock.Chu Liuyue slowly closed her eyes.In her dantian, the torn and tattered invisible book pages became small lakes and suddenly started rippling.\u2026A bulky figure hid in the darkness of the night, outside the Chu family\u2019s estate and in a dimly-lit alley. The shiny moonlight was not even as clear as his eyes.Behind him, a white lion was squatting down with grievances; there was a bruise on its forehead, which clearly just formed.Rong Xiu stood with his hands clasped behind his back and silently looked at the pitch-black, quiet yard. His voice was slightly cold as he said, \u201cIf you do it again, I\u2019ll smack your eye. Do you understand?\u201dLiked it?

Chu Liuyue bit her lips tightly until they started to bleed. However, she did not even make a single painful moan from the start till the end. She tolerated it forcefully and swallowed all her sufferings.The lack of a Yuan meridian in her body was like the dry and dehydrated ground that cracked like a tortoiseshell.All the energy surged into her body like a thunderstorm flooding the ground.In the past, Chu Liuyue\u2019s body could not even keep the energy; she could only watch it slip away. Now, the waves of energy kept surging in her body, and there was finally a change in her body\u2019s Yuan meridian.The dry and cracked Yuan meridian started getting nourished and grew.As time passed slowly, the color of the medicinal bath also started to become lighter. All the energy in it was absorbed by Chu Liuyue.Chu Liuyue shockingly discovered that some of the energy from the herbs entered her body and nourished her Yuan meridian, causing its lacking part to grow. The remaining portion of the energy went to a small lake in her dantian.This lake was very small and had a clear color. When the energy entered the lake, it magically disappeared as if it was swallowed by something.Chu Liuyue had observed it for quite some time and discovered that the lake was like a bottomless pit. Except for a few rippling waves, there were no signs of all the energy it absorbed.She started to become curious.That lake was transformed from the torn, transparent page. The blood-colored symbol that appeared at the start had never shown up again.What exactly was it? How did it get there?She searched through the original Chu Liuyue\u2019s memories thoroughly but did not find any relevant memories at all. It was as if it had appeared out of nowhere.The crucial point was that she had clearly never seen such a thing before, but she felt a sense of familiarity towards it.It seemed like\u2026 she brought it with her when she was reborn.Chu Liuyue decided not to think about it and focused on her Yuan meridian\u2019s recovery instead since she could not figure out what exactly was going on in such a short time.A night quickly passed.In the morning, Chu Liuyue woke up when the medicinal bath turned transparent.After briefly packing her items, Chu Liuyue found some wood, made a simple quincuncial pile, carved a wooden statue, and placed it at the side. She then tied one sandbag to each of her limbs and started training.The training was very simple, but this was the most convenient and effective method to strengthen her body quickly in this scenario.The Chu family had their own training ground, but she had always been ostracized. If she went there, she might cause some unwanted trouble. Even though she was not scared of trouble, she did not want to waste any time on it.She wanted to frighten the rest and cause them to tone down on the bullying a little by using Chu Liansheng as a warning to the rest. She even made use of her marriage agreement with the Crown Prince to shock First Elder, Chu Xianmin, and the rest.She then had to take advantage of this time to improve her body condition to the best that it could be.Her forehead started to sweat; her breathing started to intensify, and her entire body was as heavy as a rock after running around the yard for a short period.Chu Liuyue was helpless. This body was too weak. If she did not train it, she would not even be able to absorb the energy from the herbs, let alone from other sources.Sweat gradually drenched her shirt.It was currently July, the hottest month of the year. One could just imagine how hard it would be to train intensely under the ferocious sun.Her face turned red; her lips were pale as sweat trickled down her neck. Her black hair was stuck to her face, and she looked terrible.When she pushed her body out of her comfort zone, her legs turned to jelly, and she literally knelt on the floor. However, she did not stop. She went in front of the wooden statue, took a deep breath, and started training her basic moves.In her previous life, she no longer trained in this aspect after she became a stage three warrior when she was seven. She focused on higher levels of martial arts and the Xuan symbol. It was lucky that she knew all the harshest and most accurate moves. Her experience was very useful to her now that she was picking them up again.Bang!Bang!Bang!In the quiet yard, one could only hear the sounds of a body hitting a wooden statue. The atmosphere was very solemn.Chu Liuyue kept training herself like a maniac as if she did not know what exhaustion was.\u2026Chu Ning worked as the Dragon Tiger Store\u2019s second-in-charge. The Dragon Tiger Store was a weapons store under the Chu family that normally sold knives, swords, and other weapons. He was sent to work here after he got injured since he was pretty knowledgeable about various weapons.He was supposed to be the second-in-charge, but his status was still very low since he was trampled on by his younger brother\u2014Chu Xianmin\u2019s father\u2014Chu Yan. Furthermore, all the servants also ostracized him. However, Chu Ning discovered that these people were targeting him even more today.When he went back to the store, he saw that all the weapons were placed haphazardly. He knitted his brows. \u201cXiao Song, why didn\u2019t you clean this place up? Everything is in a mess.\u201dWu Song continued to sit and not move as he munched on his plum and said lazily, \u201cIf it\u2019s messy, you can clean it up on your own. Can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m busy?\u201d When he talked, the few people in the store all turned around to look at them.Chu Ning\u2019s blood boiled as he saw Wu Song roll his eyes and chuckle. \u201cDo you still think that you\u2019re the Chu family\u2019s Eldest Young Master? You should pee on the floor and use it to take a look at yourself!\u201dThe crowd laughed in secret and were all waiting to see Chu Ning\u2019s farce.Everyone knew that his daughter, Chu Liuyue, had thoroughly offended Third Missy Chu Xianmin.The father-daughter duo would definitely not have it easy in the future. Perhaps they would be chased out of the Chu family soon.Chu Ning took a deep breath and said solemnly, \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re not going to clean it up?\u201dWu Song ignored him, finished his last plum, and clapped his hands as he stood up. He walked to the side and extended his hands to make a mess out of everything that was arranged nicely.Cling! Kuang!All the daggers, swords, and knives dropped all over the floor.\u201cIsn\u2019t it even messier now? I think you should clean it up yourself. Haha!\u201d said Wu Song as he laughed arrogantly.Once Chu Ning left, it would only be a matter of when he became the second-in-charge as long as he sucked up to the store\u2019s first-in-charge, Chu Yan.Chu Ning clenched his fists tightly.Wu Song whistled nonchalantly. \u201cOh? Do you want to fight? I think you haven\u2019t improved much over the years, right? Do you want to test your skills?\u201d As he was talking, his gaze purposely landed on Chu Ning\u2019s leg.His gaze made Chu Ning\u2019s anger erupt; he sent a flying punch out.Wu Song moved backward and dodged the punch very quickly.\u201cHah, is that all\u2026\u201d Before he could finish his mockery, Chu Ning swiftly moved forward and sent out a second punch.Bang!Wu Song was not prepared at all and was hit square in the face. He directly fell onto the floor, and his nose and mouth started bleeding. However, Chu Ning did not let him off and followed closely after. He grabbed Wu Song by his collar and gave him a good beating.His punches rained down, and Wu Song quickly became unconscious.Everyone looked on with their mouths agape.Wu Song was not weak. Logically speaking, a half-crippled Chu Ning should not be faster than Wu Song! So how were Chu Ning\u2019s actions faster than Wu Song\u2019s?Dong!Chu Ning smashed Wu Song\u2019s head on the floor and finally stopped when he saw blood on his hands. His sharp gaze looked towards the crowd. \u201cIs there anyone else who wants to fight it out?\u201dEveryone subconsciously took a step back.The weak and easily bullied Chu Ning\u2026 seemed to have changed!Chu Ning wiped away the blood on his hands and was stunned the moment he turned around. That\u2019s not right? It seems like my actions are much faster than before. The force in my body also seems to be even smoother than before when I rushed over.He slowly lowered his head and looked at his right shin. For some reason, he suddenly thought of Yue\u2019er passing him that bowl of medicine.She had said that he would definitely get better.Liked it?

Without even looking, she knew that her body must be packed with bruises, but she was very happy. Doing such training would not only completely unleash the herbs\u2019 effectiveness, but she could also strengthen her fitness, which would be advantageous for her future cultivation.Chu Ning noticed the extra quincuncial pile in the yard the moment he came home.A thin, young girl was currently removing the sandbags attached to her limbs beside it.Even though the sky was already dark, he could still see her exhaustion. Chu Ning\u2019s heart immediately started to hurt. \u201cYue\u2019er.\u201dChu Liuyue raised her head and smiled at him. \u201cFather.\u201dChu Ning\u2019s words of advice stopped at the tip of his tongue, and he decided not to say them anymore. Chu Ning knew that Yue\u2019er had gone through an enormous setback after the previous incident, and she had changed completely.It was obvious that she was trying hard to become stronger. The only thing he could do now was to do his best to support and protect her.\u201cYue\u2019er, I think the herbs you boiled yesterday are pretty useful!\u201d Chu Ning walked over and wiped her sweat. Although he had tried his best to contain himself, he could not hide his excitement and curiosity.Chu Liuyue showed a look of surprise. \u201cReally?\u201dChu Ning nodded and did not tell her about what happened in the store, but just said that he suddenly felt that his condition was much better than before.\u201cIt looks like our Yue\u2019er really has the gift to become a heavenly doctor!\u201d Chu Ning was extremely emotional. If they had discovered this earlier, Yue\u2019er would not have to suffer so much all these years.Chu Liuyue smiled and blinked. \u201cIt\u2019s great if it works! It\u2019s not too late to discover this talent now.\u201dChu Ning thought that she was comforting herself and nodded. \u201cYeah. Yue\u2019er, you should rest well during this time. We\u2019ll find you a good teacher after some time.\u201dChu Liuyue smiled and did not say a word. Teacher? Even all the heavenly doctors in Country Yao Chen combined aren\u2019t good enough to be my teacher.\u201cOh yes, your birthday is coming. By then\u2026 what are you going to do about your marriage agreement with the Crown Prince?\u201d Chu Ning spoke hesitantly. He did not bring this topic up previously since the father and daughter had literally been abandoned by everyone else, and his daughter always had some wild dreams about the Crown Prince.Now that they started anew, she should start to consider this problem. After all, there was only about a month left.Chu Liuyue\u2019s smile turned slightly cold. \u201cI\u2019ll just wait and see.\u201d She was not the first person to panic.\u2026At night, Xue Xue appeared as usual, but there was an extra bruise on his head.Chu Liuyue asked about it, and Xue Xue buried its head in grievance.Was it easy for him? Its master clearly agreed to let it come here, but he hit it in the end. When it came the previous day, it did not know that it would coincidentally see Chu Liuyue taking off her clothes. It was frustrated to death.Chu Liuyue did not pay much attention to it after taking a look at its injury and realizing that it was not severe. She allowed the fellow to just lie in bed while she started to meditate and only slept in the latter half of the night.When Chu Liuyue was sleeping soundly, Xue Xue then opened its eyes and inched closer toward her, wrapping its exuded warmth and strength around Chu Liuyue.\u2026Everyone quickly forgot about the conflicts in the Chu family. This was because there was new popular news in the Imperial City\u2014Seventh Prince Rong Xiu came back from Mingyue Tianshan.Even though he was dressed casually and was very low key, an imperial edict from the Emperor immediately made the Seventh Prince the hot topic during meals.Seventh Prince Rong Xiu finally came back after staying outside for so many years. The Emperor was so happy, he directly named him \u2018Prince Li\u2019 and gifted him a mansion\u2014Prince Li Mansion\u2014to stay in.One could see the important meaning behind this imperial edict upon closer inspection.Firstly, this proved that the Seventh Prince would stay in the Imperial City. Secondly, this showed that the Emperor liked and thought extremely highly of the Seventh Prince.One had to know that the current emperor had nine sons\u2014three of them passed on early, and six were left. Other than the first son, Rong Jin, who had been made the Crown Prince the moment he was born, out of the remaining eight sons, only Fifth Prince Rong Qi\u2014who had the same mother as the Crown Prince\u2014was made \u2018Prince Ping.\u2019One could tell from this that naming Rong Xiu as \u2018Prince Li\u2019 would attract a lot of attention.Initially, no one had much of an impression of him and did not really care that the weak Seventh Prince had come back. However, it was hard not for one to overthink now that he was made \u2018Prince Li\u2019 the moment he came back to the Imperial City.Overnight, Prince Li Mansion became a hotspot; many people sent letters to seek an audience. However, the Prince Li Mansion rejected all of them, claiming that Prince Li was exhausted from all the traveling and needed to rest.Chu Liuyue naturally did not know about all these secret happenings. Now, she was most concerned about her own body.Zhen Bao Pavilion was very diligent in their work; the second batch of herbs was delivered over punctually.Chu Liuyue did not busy herself with arranging the herbs, but chose to go out instead. This time, she did not directly leave from the main entrance but disguised herself as a young man. She wore a black robe and a hat, and flipped over the wall near the backdoor.The Imperial City was very crowded, and many people wore all sorts of weird outfits on the streets, so Chu Liuyue\u2019s garb did not gather much attention.She left the Chu family compound and headed all the way west until she reached Ghost Street at the city\u2019s west side.The name was Ghost Street, but it was actually a place where people from all walks of life sold or bought items. It was a very messy place, and it sold everything at different prices. It was unknown how much money was needed to buy what kind of items.It was precisely because of this that people loved to visit this place. If they were lucky, they could buy some items at a lower price.Chu Liuyue also came here today with similar thinking.Ghost Street was indeed very crowded, and it was filled with all sorts of stalls on both ends.Chu Liuyue leisurely walked as if she was casually looking around, but her gaze was actually rapidly sweeping past the items.Time passed slowly. After going through half of Ghost Street, Chu Liuyue did not find anything she liked and was quite disappointed.When she was considering if she should go back, she spotted something in a torn stall from the corner of her eyes.Her heart tingled, and she walked over calmly.It was a rock around the size of a fist. It was grayish-white on the outside and even grew green moss. It looked just like a rock that someone casually picked up from the ground. However, if one took a closer look at it, one could see the two red streaks coming from the rock.This showed that a precious ruby was most likely hidden in the rock.Just when Chu Liuyue was about to ask for the price, someone intercepted her and picked up the stone.It was a man around the age of 20. He had a chubby head, big ears, and was wearing a cotton gown. His entire body was exuding the aura of an upstart.\u201cHeh. I can\u2019t believe my luck is pretty good today, and I met with this red stone! Old man, name your price.\u201dThe owner of the stall was an elder with white hair. It was currently summer, but he was wearing a torn, cotton gown and was shaking a thin fan as he lay there lazily. Upon hearing this voice, he opened his eyes and extended one finger.\u201cOne hundred silver taels?\u201dThe elder shook his head.\u201cTen thousand silver taels.\u201dThe young man exploded, and his fat body started to vibrate. \u201cAre you crazy? I\u2019m already giving you face by quoting 100 taels for a red rock. How dare you try to scam me? Do you know who I am? I\u2019m the future Crown Princess\u2019s cousin!\u201dUpon hearing this, the silent Chu Liuyue raised her brows.Why did she not remember having such a cousin?Liked it?

So, this is Chu Xianmin\u2019s cousin.Things haven\u2019t even begun to take shape, yet he was trying to claim his connections. Indeed, people who didn\u2019t belong together also didn\u2019t get to live together.The old man scoffed. \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are! Ten thousand silver taels, not a penny less. You can\u2019t afford it, but there are many who can.\u201dLu Zhitao was so furious that he could only laugh. Playing with that red stone, he spoke openly, \u201cReally? I\u2019d like to see who would be willing to buy this thing.\u201dHe glared at his surroundings with a look of warning. Those who had been interested in the red stone stopped in their tracks. Nobody could afford to offend the Lu family\u2019s Fourth Young Master.A red stone of this size would cost 2,000 silver taels at most. Nobody would pay 10,000 silver taels for it.Moreover, Lu Zhitao deliberately made a spectacle of himself by announcing his name. One would be going against him if they bought the stone.Most people had heard that the Crown Prince was fond of Chu Xianmin. For the past two days, it was even rumored that the Crown Prince\u2019s personal bodyguard, Song Yuan, had hand-delivered her invitation to the Crown Prince\u2019s birthday banquet.It seemed that Chu Xianmin would be the future Crown Princess. To offend the Lu family was akin to offending the Crown Prince.There was dead silence in the area.Lu Zhitao was proud of himself. \u201cOld man, you should know better. No one will buy this except me.\u201d\u201cTen thousand silver taels. I\u2019ll take it.\u201d A cold and clear voice called out. At the same time, a fair hand suddenly came out from the side and took that red stone away.Lu Zhitao never expected anyone to have the guts to steal what he wanted. It took him a while before he reacted.At first glance, the other party seemed to be a young girl dressed in a black robe with a bamboo hat.Lu Zhitao was so angry he almost hit the roof. \u201cWho do you think you are? Did you eat a bear\u2019s heart or a leopard\u2019s gall? You dare to steal what I wanted?\u201dThe old man was surprised too. He finally opened his other eye and took a closer look at Chu Liuyue. \u201cReally?\u201dIndeed, the red stone had excellent color, but it was definitely not worth 10,000 taels. He had casually said he would sell it for 10,000 taels because he was short of money lately, and he didn\u2019t want to sell it to Lu Zhitao. He didn\u2019t expect anyone to buy it willingly.Chu Liuyue took out a 10,000 silver tael banknote and gave it to the old man.At first, the old man hesitated, but when he saw the banknote, his eyes lit up, and he immediately accepted it. Recently, he was in a state of poverty.\u201cDon\u2019t you understand that the highest bidder gets the item? Besides, this red stone is worth 1,000 silver taels. If you want to buy it for 100 taels, where in the world would you get such a deal?\u201d said Chu Liuyue with a laugh. \u201cOr did the Lu family gain its fortune by resorting to such tactics?\u201dLu Zhitao\u2019s face turned scarlet-red from anger. His family had been implicated. Without a thought, he drew out his sword at his waist, intending to strike Chu Liuyue. \u201cI will do as I please. You are in no position to lecture me! Meet your doom!\u201dThe old man\u2014who had just received the banknote\u2014clasped his hands. His eyelids fluttered, and he was about to move. He stopped in surprise and looked at Chu Liuyue.She moved aside with light steps, turned around, and somehow managed to avoid Lu Zhitao\u2019s sword.Seeing that he missed, Lu Zhitao flew into a rage out of humiliation. He charged at Chu Liuyue again.Instead of avoiding this time, Chu Liuyue moved forward. Her body strangely bypassed his sword. She raised her leg and kicked Lu Zhitao above his elbow hard.The kick numbed his elbow, making him drop his sword.In the next moment, he felt a coldness against his neck. Chu Liuyue had already picked up his sword and placed it on his shoulders.He might lose his head if he moved.The old man\u2019s eyes changed from amazement to curiosity because of what he saw. He examined Chu Liuyue carefully. \u201cHuh?\u201dApparently, there was no fluctuation of force from this young lady. So, logically, she wasn\u2019t a match for Lu Zhitao. Those moves earlier were simple yet deadly.If she wanted, she could have Lu Zhitao dead in an instant.Interesting\u2026Lu Zhitao immediately broke into a cold sweat as he stammered, \u201cW-What\u2026 W-What\u2026 are\u2026 y-you doing? H-How d-dare\u2026\u201dChu Liuyue exerted more force. Blood began to ooze from Lu Zhitao\u2019s neck.\u201cNoisy!\u201dLu Zhitao was scared to death. He swallowed the rest of his words. He could tell that the other party was reckless. She would do anything. He really didn\u2019t have the talent for cultivation, but over the years, the Lu family had thrown in a lot of money to allow him to become a stage three martial artist at the very least.A martial artist of this level didn\u2019t have a rich source of force. One could only master some simple martial skills. However, no ordinary person could compare to them, regardless of physical strength or fighting skills.The other party was obviously not a warrior, but she could defeat him easily.\u201cGet lost!\u201d shouted Chu Liuyue.It made Lu Zhitao shiver as he stood up. He retreated continuously for more than ten paces before he finally shouted in return, putting on a show. \u201cYou! Just you wait!\u201d Without waiting for Chu Liuyue to respond, he turned around and fled.Chu Liuyue didn\u2019t take him seriously. She threw the sword down and turned to leave. It\u2019s a blessing to have bought that red stone. There\u2019s no point in staying here any longer. Besides, she knew that Lu Zhitao must have gone back to get help. She had no wish of revealing her identity so soon.The crowd that had gathered in a circle made way for Chu Liuyue subconsciously when they saw that she was leaving. Although nobody could make out this person\u2019s frame or face, there was something about her that made people submit subconsciously.\u201cHey. You there, wait.\u201d The old man reacted quickly just as she was leaving. He packed his things in a hurry and chased after her. However, when he looked up, Chu Liuyue was nowhere to be seen.He was so stunned that he couldn\u2019t help but shake his head as he chucked a curse. \u201cShe\u2019s really an alert girl!\u201d She must be dreaming if she thinks she can lose me like that.\u2026Chu Liuyue soon realized that someone was following her. She quickly changed her route and walked through several streets. Instead of returning to the Chu family, she went further and further off the beaten path, which eventually led her to a remote and narrow street with a dead end.All was silent when she arrived on the street. She turned around. \u201cIt must have been hard on you to follow me all this way. You may speak your mind.\u201dThe silhouette of an aged, stooping man appeared in the alleyway. It was the old man in the tattered cotton jacket.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No need for you to get upset, girl. I didn\u2019t stalk you on purpose. I just felt guilty for earning the 10,000 silver taels. Although I am short of money, that doesn\u2019t mean I can bully a young girl like you against my conscience, right?\u201dChu Liuyue raised an eyebrow. \u201cThere simply is no need for you to follow me because of this. To me, that red stone is worth 10,000 silver taels.\u201d It was more than worth it; she bought it for a great price!The old man didn\u2019t believe her as he shook his hand. \u201cHey, you don\u2019t have to be so polite, girl. I\u2019ve seen my share of red stones, around 90,000 to 100,000 of them. However, none of them are worth 10,000 taels. How about this? I give you something else as compensation?\u201dChu Liuyue shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201dThe old man looked crestfallen. This girl was a handful.\u201cWhat was it that you actually want to ask? You might as well spit it out.\u201dHe looked at the calm Chu Liuyue. Her sparkling dark eyes had already read his mind, so he stopped pretending to be embarrassed. \u201cActually\u2026 I wanted to know who your master is.\u201dAlthough there was no fluctuation of force from her body, he could tell that those few movements definitely originated from one or more profound martial art techniques.She must be learning from a highly-skilled expert. Otherwise, it would be impossible for her to defeat a stage three martial artist like Lu Zhitao.He had been leading a boring life all these years. It would be great if he could spar with the expert!Chu Liuyue squinted her eyes. \u201cWhat do I have to gain by telling you?\u201dThe old man scratched his head in annoyance. He was penniless, and she didn\u2019t look like she was in a shortage of money either. He finally patted his head after a long time and took out a jade pendant. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we use this to trade? It\u2019s still worth something.\u201dChu Liuyue looked at his hand, and her eyes lit up briefly.It was a jade pendant with the carving of the Xuan symbol. From the looks of it, the pendant with the Xuan symbol wasn\u2019t of inferior quality. It was definitely worth more than 10,000 taels! How could he offer it to her so casually?\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Sensing that his proposition somewhat moved her, the old man advanced a few steps and shoved the jade pendant into her hand. \u201cAn old man like me has no use for this thing. Since you like it, it\u2019s yours.\u201dAfter a moment\u2019s thought, Chu Liuyue accepted the pendant. She gladly accepted it since he dared to give it to her. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll be honest with you. I don\u2019t have a master,\u201d declared Chu Liuyue openly.The old man was so excited and full of anticipation that he instantly froze.\u201cWhat? No master? How can this be? Don\u2019t tell me you actually mastered the skills on your own?\u201dChu Liuyue coughed. She really had no explanation. \u201cIt\u2019s true. I don\u2019t have a master.\u201dThe old man caught her wrist in disbelief. \u201cDamn, girl. You better tell me the truth\u2026\u201d He suddenly paused halfway through his words. As he stared at Chu Liuyue, his face turned a few shades darker and gradually showed shock. \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026\u201dChu Liuyue\u2019s eyebrows knitted tightly together, and she intended to break away.\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re that girl from the Chu family?\u201dChu Liuyue froze. He could actually tell who she was without looking at her face? She had no recollection of such a person.The old man grew incredulous at her silence. \u201cYou\u2019re really Chu Liuyue, but I thought your Yuan meridian\u2026\u201dOh, he recognized me by checking my pulse. Chu Liuyue let out a sigh of relief, and she removed her bamboo hat. \u201cYes, I am Chu Liuyue. You are?\u201dThe old man was startled for a moment when he saw the beautiful face before him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve grown so big. But it shouldn\u2019t be\u2026 your Yuan meridian was\u2026\u201d He suddenly paused, at a loss as to what he should say.When Chu Liuyue was young, he checked her pulse and repeatedly confirmed that she was born with a defective Yuan meridian. She would never be able to cultivate for the rest of her life. However, when he accidentally touched her pulse earlier, he noticed that there seemed to be a subtle change in her Yuan meridian!Chu Liuyue\u2019s eyes narrowed as she looked at the old man\u2019s changing expression.My Yuan meridian has only just begun to repair itself; ordinary people shouldn\u2019t be able to notice. Nevertheless, this old man could tell with just one look. He must be someone extraordinary. Could he\u2026 be a heavenly doctor? At the very least, he is someone powerful.The old man shed his previous idle appearance and looked more serious. He let go of Chu Liuyue\u2019s hand while he stared into her eyes intently and asked, \u201cGirl, you better be honest with me. Who is helping you?\u201dChu Liuyue shook her head sincerely. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t anyone. You can ask around if you don\u2019t believe me. I may be the Chu family\u2019s titular eldest daughter, but I\u2019ve been treated worse than a servant all these years. It\u2019s fortunate enough that I managed to stay alive until now. What else can I ask for?\u201dThe old man remained skeptical. He hadn\u2019t been bothered with the daily ongoings in the world, so he didn\u2019t really know much about what had been happening in the Imperial City.Chu Liuyue was a born loser. Anyone could guess the kind of life she had been living all these years.What if there is someone helping them behind their backs\u2026 But she and Chu Ning have nobody to rely on. Who would they go to? \u201c\u2026 There\u2019s some truth in what you\u2019ve said, girl. However, your Yuan meridian\u2026 there simply isn\u2019t any explanation for it.\u201dThe old man thought long and hard, but he couldn\u2019t guess the reason for the sudden change in Chu Liuyue\u2019s Yuan meridian. He hit his head with his fan in agony.Chu Liuyue glanced at the sky, noting its color. \u201cIf there is nothing else, I will take my leave.\u201d Although she couldn\u2019t be sure of this old man\u2019s identity, Chu Liuyue was certain that his origins were definitely not simple. She wouldn\u2019t offend someone like that now.The old man waved his hand casually, still frowning as he pondered the question that he didn\u2019t have the answer to. \u201cIs it\u2026\u201dChu Liuyue didn\u2019t stay long; she left with haste.All that was left in the alleyway was that old man deep in his thoughts.\u2026Everything was normal as Chu Liuyue returned to the Chu family.The new batch of herbs had been delivered. As per the norm, she boiled Chu Ning\u2019s medicine first and awaited his return to give it to him.Without saying a word, Chu Ning drank all his medicine. His initial misgivings had long since been dispelled by his apparent improvement in health. In his opinion, his daughter was an indisputable genius! He felt the warm power surge through his limbs.Chu Ning sighed softly. \u201cYue\u2019er, I\u2019ll take you to a master when I\u2019m feeling better. A talent like yours must not be wasted!\u201dChu Liuyue asked, seemingly unintentionally, \u201cFather, how many heavenly doctors are there in Country Yao Chen?\u201dChu Ning thought for a moment. \u201cThe conditions for becoming a heavenly doctor are very harsh. Even those who are slightly gifted might not become one in the end. Today, there are only seven heavenly doctors throughout the entire Country Yao Chen.\u201dChu Liuyue asked some indirect questions, but it was a pity that Chu Ning had little knowledge regarding the heavenly doctors. In the end, she could find nothing to link that old man.She knew there was no point in rushing, so she stopped her inquiries completely. When Chu Ning left, she resumed boiling her own medication.Xue Xue didn\u2019t come that night.\u2026In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.An unwelcome guest arrived just when Chu Liuyue was going to boil Chu Ning\u2019s medication\u2014it was that old man.He had apparently not entered through the main entrance. He was still clothed in the same tattered cotton jacket. There were even a few pieces of fallen leaves on his head; the dark eye bags beneath his eyes indicated that he had not slept for the last few days.Chu Liuyue was surprised to see him like this. \u201cHow did you enter?\u201dThe old man\u2019s eyes were sad. \u201cI have pondered for the past three days and three nights, but I just can\u2019t figure out\u2026\u201dChu Liuyue was shocked to hear that he had not had a single day or night\u2019s rest since she last saw him.He reached out with his quivering hands, pointed to the pot of aromatic herbs, and complained as if he had suffered a great deception. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me who is helping you! You have made this old man very miserable!\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Alas, he was still clueless after thinking for three days. Finally, he had no choice but to come to the Chu family estate and see for himself.He almost lost his temper at the sight. The entire courtyard was filled with a strong scent of medicinal herbs. He knew they weren\u2019t any simple herb as soon as he smelled the fragrance.No ordinary person could have blended so many herbs together perfectly. It was a hard feat to achieve, even for him.This girl said nobody is helping her. She must be jesting! The old man\u2019s sorrowful face wore an expression of \u2018you\u2019re a big liar.\u2019Chu Liuyue could do nothing but nurse her forehead with her hand. An ordinary man might not know her purpose for brewing these herbs, but not this old man. He certainly knew what these herbs were for.Not bothering to cover up, Chu Liuyue simply shrugged her shoulders. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, so be it.\u201d With that, she opened the jade box and resumed sorting the herbs.The old man was clearly shocked because Chu Liuyue had shown no interest in explaining further. He was so angry his hair almost caught fire, and he sat on a rock to sulk.\u201cGirl, I\u2019m not leaving until you\u2019ve given me an explanation!\u201dChu Liuyue nodded to humor him. \u201cAlright. There\u2019s water in the house if you\u2019re thirsty.\u201dOh! What sort of attitude is that? The old man waved his fan wildly with anger, his beard fluttering. This time, he was really up against Chu Liuyue!\u2026Seeing that Chu Liuyue was actually ignoring him, the old man gave a low snort and casually surveyed the courtyard.The Chu family was, by all accounts, one of the Imperial City\u2019s four great families. It might be at the bottom of the pecking order, but it still had its heritage. Nevertheless, this courtyard was so remote and shabby that it was no different from any other poor house.Nobody would believe that the once magnificent Chu Ning and his only daughter resided here. To make things worse, these two were the Chu family\u2019s direct descendants, and this was what they ended up with.The old man sighed inwardly; his anger gradually subsiding.He then looked at the plum blossom stakes and the other things in the courtyard, which were clearly set up recently.Were these\u2026 used for Chu Liuyue\u2019s training? It\u2019s too shabby. This father and daughter are living a miserable life!A uniquely bitter and sour smell suddenly drifted in. The old man twitched his nose. He saw Chu Liuyue take out a black dried vine, which was about an arm\u2019s length, and put it into the boiling pot.\u201cHey, why are you adding the Dried Wall Vine in there directly? The boiling water will cause it to melt, and it will greatly lose its effectiveness.\u201d The old man quickly rushed to Chu Liuyue\u2019s side. He said hatefully, \u201cYou, girl. The Dried Wall Vine is worth a fortune! It\u2019s not something that\u2026\u201dHe stopped talking abruptly. The Dried Wall Vine should have melted instantly in the pot. However, it was lying well within it instead.Mist rose from the boiling water as the heat began puffing out. Nevertheless, the vine remained intact!Gradually, an ink-like liquid flowed out of the Dried Wall Vine and merged with the boiling water.That uniquely bitter and sour smell actually became sweet. This smell could only be achieved through the full distillation of the Dried Wall Vine\u2019s potency.The old man\u2019s eyes widened as he stared incredulously. \u201cH-How can this be possible?\u201dThe Dried Wall Vine had extremely powerful properties for repairing injuries. On top of that, it could only be found on steep cliffs, and it took ten years to grow an inch long. Thus, it was very valuable. However, such a rare herb was also troublesome to handle. Its texture was extremely thin and brittle. Once damaged, it would lose its medicinal effects instantly. The only way would be to put it into water and steam it slowly.Its medicinal effects would be affected by the water temperature, too. The water couldn\u2019t be too cold or too hot. When in contact with boiling water, it would quickly turn into waste.At this moment, not only did the Dried Wall Vine not melt in the boiling water, but it also stirred up its strongest medicinal effects!\u201cHow\u2026 did you do that?\u201d The old man looked at Chu Liuyue blankly.Chu Liuyue pointed. \u201cTake a closer look.\u201dThe old man rolled his eyes and leaned a little closer. Finally, he saw a silvery layer of white ice crystals covering the Dried Wall Vine.\u201cIs\u2026 this\u2026 Silver Ice Grass?\u201d This was an extremely common medicinal herb that was usually used to relieve pain because of its silvery-white body and icy-cold properties.\u201cGround Silver Ice Grass into powder and add it into the water 15 minutes in advance. When the Dried Wall Vine is added into the boiling water, the powdered Silver Ice Grass will coat itself on the vine. This way, the vine will not melt,\u201d explained Chu Liuyue.One thing to bring down another. Silver Ice Grass might be ordinary, but it had an excellent use in this instance.The old man was momentarily stunned. Then, he slapped his thigh. \u201cRight! Why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201dChu Liuyue simply smiled.It wasn\u2019t really a secret. The heavenly doctor merely had a different understanding and application of the herbs\u2019 medicinal properties.\u201cThis method\u2026 where did you learn it from?\u201d The old man finally reacted. He looked at Chu Liuyue with glowing eyes.Chu Liuyue fished the Dried Wall Vine out from the pot. Its effectiveness had been achieved. It would be better to take out the remaining residue as soon as possible. \u201cI figured it out myself.\u201dThe old man naturally didn\u2019t believe her. But after questioning her for a long time, he still didn\u2019t get an explanation out of Chu Liuyue. He couldn\u2019t help but feel annoyed. His eyes never left that pot of boiling herbs again.Chu Liuyue didn\u2019t cover the pot but generously allowed him to see.This medicine was for Chu Ning; the recipe was quite ordinary, and there was nothing to show him. The technique and the heat control when boiling the medicine was more important.Some people had no talent. Even if one was to memorize the recipe or tried diligently, one still wouldn\u2019t be able to become a heavenly doctor.The courtyard was silent. The old man was watching Chu Liuyue boiling medicine from the side, his appearance gradually changing.Chu Liuyue\u2019s series of movements flowed smoothly, even the timing and the amount of each herb added was perfect!The medicinal fragrance grew stronger and stronger. It was a sign that the medicinal powers were fusing with each other. This would never have been possible without thousands of hours of practice. Even he could do no better than Chu Liuyue.Snap.The jade box closed, and the last of its herbs were put in.Throughout the whole process, not counting the ones Chu Liuyue had already put in before he arrived, she had added a total of 35 herbs at least! This was apparently not the limit of Chu Liuyue\u2019s level.She was definitely good enough to be a heavenly doctor! Whoever she had learned these skills from, he could be sure of one thing\u2014Chu Liuyue had unparalleled talent in the path of becoming a heavenly doctor.What is wrong with the Chu family? How could they not cherish this once-in-a-century genius? How could they bully her so recklessly? He looked around the dilapidated courtyard with irony. He rubbed his hands together and looked at Chu Liuyue\u2019s eyes. It was like he was looking at a great treasure.\u201cGirl, I won\u2019t ask you about those things anymore. There is one thing I have to ask of you though. I wish to come here and watch you concoct medicine in the future. Will you be alright with it?\u201dChu Liuyue shook her head. There were too many things she had to do; it would be inconvenient to have another person here.\u201cThen, then\u2026 I\u2019ll just come once every three days?\u201dChu Liuyue shook her head again.\u201cF-Five\u2026 five days?\u201d\u201cOnce a fortnight. If you don\u2019t agree, one month then.\u201d\u201cFine. Fine. Fortnightly. Once every fortnight!\u201d The old man was afraid that she would go back on her word. He nodded his head as if he was pounding garlic, and a smile broke on his face.Chu Liuyue suddenly tilted her head and asked thoughtfully, \u201cAnd may I ask in what capacity you will be here as?\u201dLiked it?

Troubled, he shook his head. This was indeed a problem. He had slipped in without anyone\u2019s knowledge, but he couldn\u2019t do that every time. Although the Chu family\u2019s defense didn\u2019t deter him, he couldn\u2019t be so casual if he planned on coming to learn something from Chu Liuyue.Moreover, the line of heavenly doctors had many rules and regulations. One should know that many Heavenly doctors placed extreme importance on their own concocting methods and its processes; they rarely allowed bystanders to watch and study them unless they were teaching their own disciples.Chu Liuyue had already promised to allow him to visit once every fortnight. In fact, she was already very generous.As for his status\u2026\u201cHow about\u2026 accepting me as your apprentice?\u201d The old man spoke with excitement, but he frowned instantly and looked hesitant.\u201cOh my, I already had a master. He might have passed on, but it\u2019s still a bit difficult for me to just acknowledge someone else as my master.\u201dChu Liuyue looked at him, speechless. This proposal also placed her in a difficult position. She had no wish to have such an elderly apprentice.\u201cHow about this? Why don\u2019t you be my master?\u201d suggested Chu Liuyue.The old man was surprised as he played with his fan. \u201cEh\u2026 that won\u2019t do! How can I be your master when I\u2019m the one seeking your advice?\u201d He could tell that Chu Liuyue\u2019s standard was as good as the others; he wasn\u2019t qualified to be her master.Chu Liuyue\u2019s eyebrows curved. \u201cWhy are you being so polite? I am new to the world, and there are many things I don\u2019t understand. Naturally, I will need a master for guidance. Don\u2019t tell me that you have no wish to accept me as your disciple?\u201d\u201cNo, no, no\u2026 how can you say that? How could anyone in this world not want you as their disciple?\u201d Suddenly, something dawned on the old man. He stopped talking abruptly, his eyes widening. \u201cWait, wait! You mean to say that you have not accepted a master up to now?\u201dChu Liuyue blinked sincerely. \u201cThat\u2019s right! Didn\u201dt I tell you that from the beginning?\u201dThe old man eyed her with suspicion, not daring to believe wholeheartedly. In the end, he could only guess that she definitely had a highly-skilled expert behind her, and for some reason, he couldn\u2019t come forward. \u201cYou\u2014are you saying that you want me to be your master?\u201dChu Liuyue nodded. The old man might believe her earlier words, but anyone else would doubt it. She needed a \u2018master\u2019 as a reason for her sudden change. In the future, all she had to say was that she had already been secretly taught by her master and had been biding her time before if anyone asked.The old man was silent for a long while. He wasn\u2019t stupid; he knew exactly what Chu Liuyue was planning. To have such a mind and tactics is enough to prove that she is definitely not as useless and incompetent as the outside world says she is! On the contrary, she has top-notch talent and superior intelligence.Such a girl was only 14 years old\u2026 There was no telling how many secrets she was hiding. Once she agreed, she would definitely be involved in a lot of trouble.Chu Liuyue looked calm; she didn\u2019t rush him.The old man\u2019s expression changed; his eyes went back and forth between Chu Liuyue\u2019s face and the boiled medicine soup. He had already made up his mind that he would never get involved in those messy things, but\u2026He really wanted to watch Chu Liuyue concoct medicine!\u201cYes! I promise!\u201d The old man gritted his teeth and finally made up his mind. \u201cFrom now on, I will watch you concoct medicine in secret. But in plain sight, I will be your master.\u201dChu Liuyue was unsurprised by his reply. Her eyebrows smoothened at his words. She then folded her hands and bent her knees slightly. \u201cMaster, your disciple, Chu Liuyue, greets you.\u201dIt was a formal ritual for a master to accept their apprentice.The old man was startled as he looked at Chu Liuyue\u2019s somewhat green face. For a moment, he felt unrestrained joy rising inside him as well. This\u2026 is\u2026 My first disciple!In the past, he had always found it troublesome to take on a disciple. However, he had taken on such a genius as his disciple purely by coincidence!\u201cGood! Good!\u201d He felt much closer to Chu Liuyue at that moment. He hurriedly helped Chu Liuyue up. \u201cWe, as master and disciple, need not talk about those empty things. If you need anything in the future, just look for me.\u201dChu Liuyue smiled, and her eyes curved into slits. \u201cThank you, Master.\u201dHearing her call him \u2018Master\u2019 filled the old man\u2019s heart with love and compassion. \u201cMy last name is Ye. If you need to look for me in the future, you can go directly to Autumn Wind Garden in the city\u2019s west side.\u201dChu Liuyue quickly tried to recall in her mind, but she couldn\u2019t remember any character with the last name Ye, let alone Autumn Wind Garden.This was also normal. Being trapped in the Chu family for many years, she didn\u2019t know much about the outside world.This was not the time to ask about this. She simply didn\u2019t dwell on it any longer. She would know when the time was ripe.After that, Ye Lao and Chu Liuyue talked for a long time about the ways of refining medicine. He parted reluctantly when it was sunset.Chu Ning was naturally in the dark about all this. Chu Liuyue also acted as if nothing had happened as she recuperated calmly.More than 20 days flew by.Early in the morning, Zhen Bao Pavilion sent the last batch of the medicinal herbs. After Chu Liuyue counted the herbs, she began to refine the medicine in an orderly manner.Unlike the past, Chu Ning was home this time. He checked Chu Liuyue\u2019s room from time to time, feeling proud and nervous.After a few hours of boiling, Chu Liuyue finally stopped and scooped the medicinal soup out of the pot.\u201cFather, this is the last time. After drinking this, you may attempt to re-cultivate.\u201d Chu Liuyue sent the medicine over.Chu Ning quickly moved forward to accept it with excitement. His body had improved significantly over this period of time. Not only had his previously crippled calves became stronger, but his perception of his force also seemed to be even stronger!His condition even hinted that he seemed to be even better than he was at his previous peak! He had been hoping for a comeback after being down and frustrated for so many years. He just didn\u2019t expect that his own daughter would be the one to give him hope.Chu Ning drank without hesitation. The blazing power extended downwards, then entered his dantian.He lay with his legs crossed, and his hands folded in front of him. With closed eyes, he began to channel this power.The Force of Heaven and Earth around them seemed to have been guided in some way and began converging toward Chu Ning.It was a sign of a breakthrough!Chu Ning smiled with satisfaction.Chu Ning indeed had some talent to be able to take advantage of this opportunity and attempt a breakthrough. It was a pleasant surprise.Chu Liuyue withdrew quietly and returned to her room.After this period of recuperation, her body\u2019s Yuan meridian had almost recovered. There was only one last critical step left before she finished healing.She began to refine the medicine for the last time.The sky had turned dark completely by the time the medicinal soup was ready.She shed her clothes and entered the tub. The medicine\u2019s rich fragrance lingered in the air.The rising white mist almost obscured her form.She held her breath and allowed her qi to sink into her dantian.Power seeped into Chu Liuyue\u2019s limbs.Her Yuan meridian, which was originally crippled, had become moist and strong. Under the nourishment of the abundant power, her Yuan meridian continued to spread and grow.At the same time, that small lake within Chu Liuyue\u2019s dantian was actually causing waves again!A pale-red water droplet was suspended in the middle of the lake, then transformed into countless tiny, unseen particles that merged into the Yuan meridian within Chu Liuyue\u2019s body.Buzz!A majestic and vast aura overwhelmed Chu Liuyue.Liked it?

    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: The BanquetPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosChu Liuyue\u2019s whole body was shaking. At this moment, she actually felt a terrifying pressure from the ancient past that made one\u2019s soul tremble.A sudden fiery and horrifying burning sensation spread throughout her body before she even had time to be shocked.That one water droplet dispersed into millions of particles and rested on top of her Yuan meridian as though a comet had landed, instantly stirring up a great fire.Her entire body felt like it was wrapped in blazing flames.Chu Liuyue\u2019s heart thumped. Subconsciously, she curled her body into a ball, clenched her fists, and gritted her teeth. A strong bloody scent filled her nostrils and mouth. It was as though she had returned to that nightmarish day all over again.The pain she was having now was worse than that day.Chu Liuyue\u2019s body was red all over; her face was scarlet-red from the gush of blood. Her entire body was like a piece of burning charcoal. She was sweating profusely, but the steam from her blazing body dried before it could fall.For an instant, she was in complete despair.Betrayal.Burn.Death.But she bit her tongue so hard that the sharp pain woke her up the next moment. She told herself desperately that this wasn\u2019t the night for her to die in Tianling Dynasty\u2019s ancestral hall.She wanted revenge; this was what she had to go through. Right now, every second became more torturous than the last. At the same time, Chu Liuyue\u2019s Yuan meridian had finally completed its connection.After an unknown amount of time, the intense pain gradually disappeared.Chu Liuyue opened her eyes slowly and saw the murky medicinal soup in her tub, which had been clear. She immediately examined her crippled Yuan meridian. Upon examination, she couldn\u2019t help but draw a breath of cold air. \u201cThe Dijing Yuan meridian?\u201dThe Yuan meridian that was crippled initially was fully repaired; it was fluorescent and clear. It even had a faint red color.She never thought that her Yuan Meridian would reach the level of a Dijing Yuan meridian after it was restored.One had to know that in the entire Tianling Dynasty\u2019s 1,000 years of history, only two people had the Tianjing Yuan meridian. Although a Dijing Yuan meridian was a notch lower, it was still considered to be an extremely rare existence.For a body that was born with crippled Yuan meridian, she thought it would be good enough if she could reach the level of a Xuanjing Yuan meridian upon recovering, but she never thought she\u2026It was such a huge surprise!With this, her future cultivation will be twice as effective with half the work.Chu Liuyue quickly changed the water in the tub for a wash.This time, her Yuan meridian\u2019s reshaping seemed to have incidentally forced out the impurities within her body, making her feel much lighter.After tidying everything up, Chu Liuyue sat on the bed with her legs crossed beneath her and tried to absorb nature\u2019s force. She succeeded in condensing that force in her dantian and transformed it into her own power.Feeling the threads of power moving around her body, she was reassured by its familiarity. From now on, she would be able to walk the path of cultivation again! However, there was still doubt in her heart.That transparent page from the book in my dantian\u2026 what is it? The water droplet that flew out from it seemed to cause the change in my Yuan meridian. The vast and terrifying pressure I felt in that instant\u2026 what was it?Knock, knock, knock.Someone was knocking on the door.\u201cYue\u2019er, are you awake?\u201dIt was Chu Ning.Chu Liuyue looked around and realized one night had passed. She took a deep breath, got up, and walked over to open the door.Chu Ning was standing at the doorway. Instead of looking depressed and in dire straits like how he used to be, Chu Ning looked radiant. Today, he was obviously an entirely different person from before.Chu Liuyue tilted her head and smiled. \u201cFather, you\u2019ve broken through?\u201dChu Ning was stunned, and he whirled around to ruffle her hair. \u201cThere\u2019s really no hiding anything from you!\u201dTen years ago, he suffered severe trauma when he was just a step away from attaining the fifth stage as a martial artist. He hadn\u2019t made any progress since then; he was even unable to exert half the strength of a stage four martial artist because of his physical disability.Unexpectedly, ten years later, he recovered to his previous condition and even broke through to become a stage five martial artist in one fell swoop!One should know that only the Chu family head and the two elders were the only ones to reach this level.\u201cFather, I told you it would be better than before!\u201dChu Ning\u2019s talent was inherently good. It was normal for him to break through to the fifth stage after careful recuperation.Chu Liuyue had a sweet smile on her face, yet there was no surprise in her eyes. Chu Ning thought for a moment and guessed that she must have known this would happen. Chu Ning sized her up carefully. His eyes widened as a thought suddenly dawned on him. \u201cYue\u2019er, your Yuan meridian\u2026\u201dHe could actually feel the force coming from her body.Chu Liuyue blinked. \u201cFather, what day is it today?\u201dChu Ning turned pale. \u201cThe eighth day of the eighth month. You will be of marriageable age in two days.\u201d It was also the day of her engagement to the Crown Prince.Up until now, there weren\u2019t any apparent signs that the Crown Prince had been preparing for their engagement.Chu Ning thought Chu Liuyue was feeling aggrieved, and he said hastily, \u201cYue\u2019er, don\u2019t worry. I will go to the palace to seek an audience with His Majesty today and request to cancel your engagement to the Prince. His Highness is not a good match for you. That will be a relief.\u201dHe was now a stage five martial artist and was considered worthy to speak to the Emperor.Chu Liuyue chuckled lightly. \u201cCancel my engagement with the Crown Prince so that Chu Xianmin can sit back and reap the rewards? That would be too good to be true for both of them, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d She had not settled the score with them for all the years of grievances she had suffered!Chu Ning was confused. \u201cYue\u2019er, what are you going to do?\u201dChu Liuyue replied softly, \u201cI have my own plans.\u201d\u2026Outside the Imperial City, the mountains extended forever.The sunlight dappled the lush forests with light and shadows. Somewhere at the foot of the mountain, a grand birthday banquet was being held.Precious white jade tables were placed on either side with all kinds of delicacies and top-quality wine.Most of the Imperial City\u2019s distinguished sons and daughters were here, drinking and gambling. It was lively.From time to time, they looked towards their leader.There was a jaded seat in purple and gold. A young man dressed in a red and purple brocade was listening to the crowd with a smile. It was the Crown Prince, Rong Jin.Seated below him, on his right-hand side, was Chu Xianmin, looking demure and beautiful. To be placed in this position meant that the Crown Prince did indeed intend for her to be the Crown Princess!\u201cYour Highness is so refined and elegant to have chosen such a scenic place to hold your birthday party. It really is extraordinary!\u201d\u201cHaha. Brother Yue, there\u2019s something you don\u2019t know. The scenery here is beautiful, but more importantly, this mountain is the Crown Prince\u2019s hunting ground. His Highness cares about this place, but it\u2019s rarely been opened for years. Today will be a long day for us.\u201d\u201cSeriously?\u201dWith that, all heads turned towards the Crown Prince.Rong Jin nodded his head with a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Whoever can tame any of the beasts today will be able to take it away!\u201dEveryone shouted in unison after hearing the news.\u201cYour Highness is so generous!\u201dSomeone couldn\u2019t help but ridicule.\u201cYour Highness is so generous. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not for us old men, but to get a smile from a beauty. Am I right? If my memory serves me well, it seems that Third Miss Chu hasn\u2019t made a contract with any magical beasts yet.\u201dChu Xianmin blushed, and she glanced shyly at Rong Jin.Rong Jin smiled and drank his wine. \u201cIf you are not as skilled as the others, how can you blame Minmin for stealing your beasts?\u201dThe crowd humored him by laughing along.Naturally, the girls from other noble families felt annoyed and jealous. However, judging from the situation, they knew they had no choice but to hold back.Rong Jin waved his hand. \u201cGo on. Get them to open the gates.\u201dLiked it?

The types and levels of the fiends in the hunting ground could definitely not be compared to an ordinary hunting ground.If they were lucky, they could make a vow with a rare fiend!Chu Xianmin\u2019s hands were placed on top of her stomach, looking extremely elegant. However, her eyes were already sparkling with unconcealable emotions. She did not expect the Crown Prince to do so much for her.He actually prepared such a big present for her on his birthday. Even though she had not gone in to take a look, she knew that the Crown Prince prioritized the hunting ground; the fiends inside would definitely not disappoint people.Though the Chu family had their own hunting ground, they did not produce any good fiends, and she did not like any of them. It would undoubtedly be perfect if she could make a vow with a strong fiend as she was originally very talented.Rong Jin leaned in and laughed. \u201cMinmin, it\u2019s all up to you to snatch that top prize.\u201dChu Xianmin nodded shyly. \u201cI know your kind intentions, Brother Jin. I\u2019ll do my best!\u201dRong Jin laughed out loud. He liked Chu Xianmin\u2019s intelligence; she knew what to say and do at the right times.An idea flashed across Chu Xianmin\u2019s mind upon seeing him in a good mood. Afterward, she reduced the smile on her face and revealed an upset expression. She whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity Sister could not come.\u201dRong Jin\u2019s expression turned stiff and slightly cold.The surrounding crowd naturally heard her words and immediately turned around to look.How interesting! The sister that Chu Liuyue brought up was none other than the Big Missy of the Chu family\u2014Chu Liuyue.Everyone knew about her marriage agreement with the Crown Prince, but since she was born an invalid, the Crown Prince did not even care about her.The Crown Prince had not invited her to his birthday parties for quite a few years already. If Chu Xianmin did not bring her up, who would still remember that person?Rong Jin said coldly, \u201cShe\u2019s naturally stupid. Her presence will only ruin everyone\u2019s mood.\u201dChu Xianmin then seemed to realize that she had said something inappropriate and hurriedly apologized like she was in a difficult position. \u201cBrother Jin, don\u2019t get mad. I just remembered that Sister has nothing to do at home usually. Thus, I thought it would be a good thing for her to come out and play\u2026\u201dNothing to do? What could a good-for-nothing possibly do?The crowd secretly exchanged looks with mocking expressions.The Crown Prince was also very unlucky. There were so many girls from distinguished families, but he unluckily picked an invalid as his fiance. How embarrassing!\u201cI\u2019m thinking too much. Brother Jin and Sister\u2019s engagement is coming soon. Sister is very busy and has no time to care about this\u2026\u201d Chu Xianmin\u2019s voice became softer and softer and was filled with grievances and sourness, while her head gradually hung lower. \u201cI\u2019m the one that doesn\u2019t have the right to say all of this\u2026\u201dRong Jin sneered in his heart. When Song Yuan came back previously, he had already explained that day\u2019s incident to him in detail. Chu Liuyue still dared to hallucinate about their engagement. Dream on!That night, a feast would be prepared for him in the palace. He would naturally tell his father that he wanted a clean break with that good-for-nothing.Thinking of this, he said nonchalantly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of talking about someone irrelevant? Nobody can predict the future for sure. Just take care of yourself and fulfill your own tasks.\u201dChu Xianmin was elated. The Crown Prince meant that he would not have anything to do with Chu Liuyue.When she first heard Chu Liuyue nonchalantly mentioning the marriage agreement, she thought that the Crown Prince was really thinking of continuing with it. Now, it seemed like Chu Liuyue was just puffing herself up at her own cost.Chu Xianmin nodded her head obediently and looked down to hide the pleasure in her eyes when she noticed that quite a few people looked at her with envy.The smarter ones amongst the crowd immediately continued when they saw the situation.\u201cHaha! The prince is so generous today. We can\u2019t let go of this chance!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! I won\u2019t give in later!\u201d\u201cBring it on! I haven\u2019t dueled in a while. I\u2019ll practice with you later.\u201dThe crowd kept bantering with each other, and the atmosphere was very lively.Rong Jin laughed. \u201cOkay, okay. Judging by the time, they should\u2019ve brought the fellows over. It\u2019s a good time to enter the mountain now.\u201d He led the way forward as he talked.Chu Xianmin followed right behind him.The crowd fought to follow behind him, very afraid of being left behind.The crowd was delightfully surprised by what they saw after passing through a forest.The lush forest made the entire mountain look as clear as jade as it stood securely in its spot. A light breeze came by and made the leaves whistle.There was someone guarding the tall, circular, black metal fence at the bottom of the mountain every few meters.These guards were muscular and looked very strong.The crowd could not help but be astonished. It must have cost an enormous amount just to protect the hunting ground. Nobody would be as wealthy in the entire Imperial City.With such emphasis on the hunting ground, there must be fiends of high levels there.Song Yuan, who was following behind Rong Jin, had his heart skip a beat. Previously, when he was in charge of the hunting ground, there were not so many people.The pageboy, who was sent over, was currently standing in front of the hunting ground and having a fierce argument with the guard in charge of protecting the place.\u201cWho exactly are you? How dare you trespass the Crown Prince\u2019s hunting ground? Have you lost your minds? How many lives can you afford to lose when you offend the Crown Prince?\u201dThe guards remained nonchalant. \u201cDo you have evidence that the hunting ground belongs to the Crown Prince?\u201dThe pageboy was so frustrated until he laughed. \u201cEveryone in the Imperial City knows that this is the Crown Prince\u2019s territory. Why are you acting ignorant? Let me tell you; the Crown Prince will soon be here. If you still\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? What are you arguing about?\u201d Song Yuan\u2019s voice boomed as he rushed over when he noticed that something was amiss.The pageboy immediately turned around and saw that Song Yuan was already behind him. Further behind was the Crown Prince and many others. He instantly started to panic. He might just lose his life for failing to complete the task the Crown Prince had assigned him.The others might not know, but the servants in charge of Eastern Palace knew his temper the best.He hurriedly knelt on the ground. \u201cSir, I don\u2019t know where these people came from, but they\u2019ve occupied the hunting ground. Now, they\u2019re not allowing anyone to enter it.\u201dSong Yuan was stunned. How dare they mess with the Crown Prince\u2019s territory? Were they tired of living? He looked at the duo and yelled angrily, \u201cAre you guys crazy? No, who are you?\u201dThese people were clearly not theirs. He suddenly thought of something and quickly looked at the other guards far away. They were all unfamiliar faces.Song Yuan took a deep breath of cold air. Someone actually dared to snatch away their hunting ground right in front of their eyes? Why did he not receive any news before?\u201cWho are you? How dare you occupy the Crown Prince\u2019s hunting ground?\u201d His angered shout was very loud, and everyone with Rong Jin heard it crystal clear.Instantly, the atmosphere turned dead silent.Rong Jin\u2019s smile gradually stiffened. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201dWhen the two guards saw him, they greeted him but were not polite in their words. \u201cGreetings, Crown Prince. My master told me to thank the Crown Prince for your painstaking efforts spent on taking care of this hunting ground. In the future, he\u2019ll definitely pay you back for your kind deeds.\u201dRong Jin thought that he had misheard him. \u201cThis is my hunting ground. When did the owner change? Why do I not know about this?\u201dA guard raised his head and asked, \u201cCrown Prince, if this is your hunting ground, then\u2026 do you have the title deed to prove it?\u201dLiked it?

He only recovered his senses after some time and understood the person\u2019s words. The face that was usually emotionless actually revealed an unimaginable expression.I-is\u2026 this person asking me for the title deed? Just as he was about to holler, a blurry memory flashed in his brain. That\u2019s not right? I really don\u2019t have the title deed to this hunting ground. Even though it was gifted by Father back then, it\u2026 was actually a gift for Chu Liuyue. The title deed\u2026 is with Chu Liuyue!\u201cCrown Prince, the hunting ground belongs to whoever\u2019s name is written on the title deed, right? If I\u2019m not wrong, it seems like this hunting ground was never yours.\u201d Even though the guard looked ordinary, he did not mince his words in front of the prince and even had a harsh tone.Rong Jin instantly felt his stomach flip around; his chest felt like it was blocked by a ball of cotton, suffocating him and making it hard to breathe. This was because he had no way of refuting the other party\u2019s words.The crowd following behind Rong Jin was also dazed upon seeing the situation.What kind of situation was this?Why did the Crown Prince\u2019s hunting ground suddenly become someone else\u2019s?What kind of people are they, to be so daring enough to ask the Crown Prince for the title deed?One of them suddenly remembered an incident long ago. If he did not remember wrongly, the title deed should be with Chu Liuyue. However, how can a good-for-nothing like her have the ability to go head-on with the Crown Prince?Some people silently looked at Chu Xianmin.Chu Xianmin was also in a daze for quite some time. She only remembered Chu Liuyue when she noticed that many people were looking at her intentionally and subconsciously.Rong Jin tightly clenched his hands into fists in his sleeves to contain the anger raging in his heart. He asked coldly, \u201cDid Chu Liuyue send you over?\u201dThe guards shook their heads. \u201cWe have nothing to do with Big Chu Missy.\u201dRong Jin sneered in his heart. Nothing to do with her? They are even calling her \u2018Big Chu Missy.\u2019In the entire Imperial City, close to nobody would call that good-for-nothing in that manner.He would never believe that Chu Liuyue had nothing to do with this.\u201cDo you mean that the hunting ground is currently yours?\u201dThe guard said politely, \u201cIt belongs to our master.\u201d\u201cHow dare you?\u201d hollered Song Yuan as he stepped forward. \u201cThe Emperor was the one who gifted the hunting ground to the Crown Prince. He has taken care of it diligently all these years. How did it suddenly become your master\u2019s? I think you\u2019re just looking for a fight!\u201dAs he was talking, he circulated the force in his body as he turned his palm into a fist and punched one of them harshly. \u201cDragon Tiger Punch!\u201dSong Yuan was around 27 or 28 years old, but he had already surpassed a stage four warrior. This punch used his manly force and enormous strength. One could seemingly hear the punch cut through the air like a tiger\u2019s whistle.At this time, one of the guards put on a stance and threw a punch calmly. He actually chose to fight with him head-on!Bang!The boring impact noise started sounding in the quiet forest.The immense force made the leaves gathered on the ground fly up.Song Yuan did not even think of the other party as an opponent, but once he met with the other party\u2019s fist, he could feel immense strength surging toward him. He could even seemingly feel that the other party was much stronger than him.As expected, his body uncontrollably staggered backward in the next moment.Deng! Deng! Deng!He actually moved back three steps from the impact.Stabilizing his body with much difficulty, he wanted to curse at them at the top of his lungs, but he felt something coming up his throat; his mouth was suddenly filled with the taste of blood.Song Yuan pressed this breath down forcefully and swallowed the blood with much difficulty.In no time, the atmosphere became stiff.The duo attacked again, and Song Yuan staggered backward once again, while the guards were still standing stably.Judging from Song Yuan\u2019s face that was as white as a sheet, anyone could tell that he was no match for the other opponent. He was a stage four warrior, but was actually beaten so easily.Rong Jin\u2019s face was as dark as coal. He had completely lost his reputation in front of so many people; first, he was robbed of his hunting ground. His personal guard was then taught a lesson.The guard took a step back and bowed toward Rong Jin. \u201cCrown Prince, my master has ordered me to guard the hunting ground closely. I don\u2019t dare to defy his orders. I seek your understanding in this matter.\u201dIt sounded like he was seeking forgiveness, but in actual fact, he had just ripped off the Crown Prince\u2019s face and stepped on it mercilessly.In the entire Country Yao Chen, the Crown Prince had the highest status, other than the Emperor himself.Only a few people dared to do this, even if he did not have the title deed.Rong Jin asked solemnly, \u201cWho on earth is your master?\u201dThe guards lowered their heads. \u201cWe\u2019re from Zhen Bao Pavilion.\u201d\u2026In the Chu family estate\u2026Chu Liuyue took a look at the sky and finally stopped her training, as she took off the sandbags tied to her limbs. She muttered to herself, \u201cIt\u2019s almost time\u2026\u201dAs expected, hurried footsteps were heard in no time. It was the First Elder\u2019s pageboy. His face was filled with happiness as he watched her misery without any attempt to hide it.\u201cChu Liuyue, First Elder is looking for you.\u201d When he came, he saw how terrible First Elder looked. This time, Chu Liuyue was doomed.Chu Liuyue looked at him lightly. \u201cWho were you calling previously?\u201dA chill went down the pageboy\u2019s spine as he inevitably thought of Chu Liansheng. He heard that Chu Liansheng was cut by Chu Liuyue because he said the wrong things. He actually forgot that the current Chu Liuyue was different from the past.The pageboy\u2019s voice became guilty and his arrogance from before disappeared. \u201cY-you\u2026 Big Missy, First Elder is looking for you.\u201dChu Liuyue then walked over at a normal pace. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know how to call people properly, there would be no use for your tongue. Do you understand?\u201dChu Liuyue said her words nonchalantly, but it made the pageboy shiver in horror as he hurriedly nodded.Chu Liuyue then followed him to the living room calmly.The place she was living in was very isolated, so it took some time to walk over.The pageboy started to become anxious, but he did not dare to rush her and could only hold it in.After some time, Chu Liuyue then asked casually, \u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Cro\u2026\u201d The pageboy answered subconsciously, only realizing that something was not right when he opened his mouth. However, the invisible pressure given off by Chu Liuyue made him explain himself obediently. \u201cIt\u2019s the Crown Prince\u2019s people.\u201dChu Liuyue did not say anything but sneered in her heart. At this point in time, Rong Jin was still not willing to show himself. It was clear that he did not lose much.\u2026In the living room of the Chu family\u2026First Elder was sitting opposite a middle-aged man. Chu Xianmin sat beside First Elder.The middle-aged man had a square face and looked ordinary, but the half-inch long scar on his face made him look ferocious. He held his broadsword and sat there without saying a word, but it made First Elder very uneasy.This person was the Crown Prince\u2019s capable assistant. His presence was already worrying, and in addition to his words previously\u2026This Chu Liuyue is too daring!\u201cBig Missy is here\u2026\u201dThe few people in the living room raised their heads and saw Chu Liuyue walking in.First Elder could not take her behavior lying down; he slammed the table and hollered, \u201cChu Liuyue! Are you crazy? Kneel immediately. Kowtow to admit your wrongs in front of Officer Zhao!\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Do you really think that everyone else\u2019s knees are as soft as yours?\u201d\u201cYou! You!\u201d First Elder was so angry until his chest felt tight as his face reddened with anger. This Chu Liuyue is really too arrogant! She dares to use that tone to talk to me like this repeatedly!Chu Xianmin at the side immediately went up to help the First Elder and comforted him. \u201cFirst Elder, don\u2019t be angry. It\u2019s not good for your body. Sister, s-she might have done it on impulse\u2026 Sister, hurry up and apologize to First Elder and Officer Zhao.\u201d She looked at Chu Liuyue anxiously as if she was really thinking for her sake.\u201cMinmin! Don\u2019t stand up for her. This evil, unfilial creature is heartless! If not, she wouldn\u2019t do such a thing,\u201d hollered First Elder as his blood boiled even more.Chu Liuyue\u2019s eyes turned slightly cold as she raised her brows and asked, \u201cFirst Elder, if I\u2019m an evil, unfilial creature, then what is everyone in the Chu family? Don\u2019t forget that I\u2019m the Chu family\u2019s eldest daughter. Besides, I would like to know what exactly I did to infuriate First Elder.The same blood was flowing in their bodies. This kind of humiliation would implicate the entire Chu family. First Elder was instantly at a loss for words; he was so furious that his body started shaking. \u201cHow dare you have the cheek to say that? You actually sold the Crown Prince\u2019s hunting ground to Zhen Bao Pavilion privately; half of Imperial City knows about it now!\u201dThe hunting ground that the Crown Prince took meticulous care of became someone else\u2019s overnight. He was even rejected at the door on the day of his birthday party.This was way too humiliating!On the surface, everyone did not dare to talk about this incident that concerned the Crown Prince\u2019s reputation. However, it had already spread like wildfire in private. All the distinguished families in the Imperial City knew about it.One just had to think carefully and would remember that the hunting ground was initially gifted to Chu Liuyue by the Emperor.It was naturally related to Chu Liuyue, now that the hunting ground had become part of Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2019s possessions.The Chu family had now become the laughingstock of the Imperial City.Chu Liuyue was instead thinking about how strong Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2019s backing must be to embarrass the Crown Prince.An average person would not even be able to withstand the Crown Prince\u2019s authority. Even if they had the title deed, they would not be able to take advantage of the Crown Prince right in front of him.It was clear that Rong Jin did not dare to offend Zhen Bao Pavilion.If she had a chance, she could check up on it secretly\u2026 As Chu Liuyue thought of this in her heart, her facial expression did not change. \u201cThat hunting ground was originally mine. Do I still need to care about others when I decide what to do with it?\u201dShe said it righteously as if she did not think that this incident was wrong in any way.First Elder was also taken aback.Zhao Cheng knitted his brows at the side. \u201cBig Chu Missy, do you mean that you took the initiative to sell the title deed?\u201d At first, he thought that Chu Liuyue had no brains and was tricked into giving the title deed away. However, it now seemed that she had clearly done it on purpose.Chu Liuyue nodded honestly. \u201cSo what?\u201dZhao Cheng suddenly stood up, and he glared at Chu Liuyue ferociously with his sharp gaze. An invisible pressure immediately filled up the entire room. \u201cThe title deed is indeed written with Big Chu Missy\u2019s name, but don\u2019t forget that this hunting ground is a present the Emperor gifted to you for your marriage. Logically speaking, this hunting ground is only truly yours when you become the Crown Princess. Currently, you have no right to handle this on your own.\u201dChu Liuyue tilted her head. \u201cOfficer Zhao, you\u2019ve seemed to have forgotten that it\u2019s my 14th birthday in a few days, which is also my engagement day with the Crown Prince. I\u2019ll be the Crown Princess real soon. What\u2019s wrong with selling a hunting ground? Could it be\u2026 that the Crown Prince has no intentions of being engaged to me?\u201dShe looked naive; her eyes were confused as if everything was logical and right.Zhao Cheng was instantly stumped, but his blood continued to boil. Was this Chu Liuyue really mental? How can a good-for-nothing like her dream about becoming the Crown Princess?When Chu Xianmin heard the two words \u2018Crown Princess,\u2019 she was furious.Chu Liuyue really will not stop until she sees the coffin. The Crown Prince has not even made any moves until now, yet she is still dreaming.An idea flashed in her head, and she took a look at the solemn Zhao Cheng. She comforted him softly, \u201cOfficer Zhao, Sister is indeed in the wrong for this, but\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat right do you have to judge if I did the right thing or not?\u201d interrupted Chu Liuyue.Chu Xianmin revealed a wronged expression, and her tears rapidly welled up. She said pitifully, \u201cIt looks like\u2026 Sister is still angry at me. However, Sister, Brother Jin and I are really not like what you think\u2026 If Sister was angry and sold the hunting ground on impulse because of this misunderstanding, then it would really be my fault!\u201dThis one sentence seemed as if she was standing up for Chu Liuyue, but it would only make other people hate Chu Liuyue even more. They would feel that she was a very petty and self-centered person.Chu Liuyue smiled casually. \u201cWhat misunderstanding? I\u2019m the one with a marriage agreement with the Crown Prince. What is there to misunderstand? If not, can you really snatch my marriage agreement away?\u201dChu Xianmin\u2019s face turned white. Now, it looked like she really did not have any right.Chu Liuyue became increasingly arrogant just because of the marriage agreement.She lowered her head in grievance and did not utter a word.Zhao Cheng sneered. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Big Chu Missy to be so amazing.\u201dEveryone knew that the Crown Prince liked Chu Xianmin, but Chu Liuyue still dared to talk about the marriage agreement.We\u2019ll see what pride she will be left with after the Crown Prince gives up on the marriage agreement. \u201cSince Big Chu Missy doesn\u2019t want to get the title deed back, then may I trouble you to explain it to the Emperor and the Crown Prince yourself?\u201dAs he said, he looked at First Elder and bowed. \u201cI would like to invite First Elder and Big Chu Missy to enter the palace and meet the Emperor for tonight\u2019s feast. You can also talk to the Crown Prince about the engagement.\u201dThe last sentence was filled with unconcealable mockery.First Elder hurriedly said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Officer Zhao.\u201dZhao Cheng turned around and walked away after he finished his sentence. When he walked by Chu Liuyue, he purposely stopped for a while. \u201cBig Chu Missy, I\u2026 wish you the best of luck.\u201dHis aggression went straight towards Chu Liuyue. However, Chu Liuyue still smiled lightly without a change in expression. \u201cI\u2019ll return this wish back to the Crown Prince.\u201dWhen Zhao Cheng met with her gaze, he instantly felt an icy cold suppression. His heart unconsciously skipped a beat, and he unknowingly reduced the aggression he was giving off.He sneered, clenched his fists tightly, and turned around to walk away.First Elder glared at Chu Liuyue harshly. \u201cLet\u2019s see if you\u2019ll still dare to be this arrogant after tonight\u2019s feast.\u201dChu Liuyue shrugged her shoulders. \u201cNo one knows who will have the last laugh.\u201d After she finished her sentence, she turned and walked away.First Elder cursed. \u201cEvil creature!\u201dA smile darted across Chu Xianmin\u2019s eyes. After tonight, both the Chu family and the Crown Prince will not care about Chu Liuyue anymore.\u2026Prince Li Mansion\u2026The officer handing over the invitation letter was waiting outside politely with his back bent. He did not dare to move casually, which would show his disrespect, even under the sweltering heat that caused his body to be drenched in sweat.Even though the person inside had just returned to the capital, the title \u2018Prince Li\u2019 was enough to reveal his status in the Emperor\u2019s heart.Screech!The door opened.A young guard wearing a light green gown came in.He knew that this person was Prince Li\u2019s personal guard\u2014Yan Qing\u2014and immediately greeted him. \u201cGreetings, Officer Yan Qing. May I know if Prince Li will be attending the Crown Prince\u2019s feast at night?\u201dPrince Li had come back for nearly one month, but he had not stepped out before. It seemed like he would not\u2026\u201cOf course, I will.\u201d A young man\u2019s low voice, with a hint of pleasure, sounded clearly from the study as if precious stones had hit each other.She was going, so he would naturally go as well.Liked it?

He was well-loved by the Emperor. With the addition of his outstanding talent and extraordinary capabilities, the Emperor favored him even more over the years.Many people would then naturally lick the boots of someone with such high status.Power and status would naturally come their way if they got into the Crown Prince\u2019s good books.The crowd entered gradually, making the palace increasingly lively.The crowd was not as restricted yet since the Emperor, Empress, and the Crown Prince had yet to arrive. In between the chuckles, there was a seemingly odd atmosphere. Quite a few people kept looking at the entrance as if they were waiting for someone to arrive.\u201cHey, did you hear? The Crown Prince was humiliated today.\u201d\u201cWhat? When did this happen? Why don\u2019t I know about it?\u201d\u201cBrother Yan, you still don\u2019t know about this? It has been spreading like wildfire. Today, the Crown Prince said that he wanted to go to the hunting ground\u2026\u201dEveryone started chiming in with excited and nosy expressions. They were clearly talking about the incident.It was impossible to stop the news from spreading as Rong Jin had indeed invited quite a number of people with extraordinary statuses.One spread to two, two to three, and in no time, everyone knew about it.\u201cIsn\u2019t that person from the Chu family an invalid? Why does she have so much guts to sell the hunting ground? Everyone knows that the Crown Prince loves that hunting ground and has spent a lot of effort on it. How dare she just sell it?\u201d\u201cHah, what does an invalid know? She most likely wanted to attract the Crown Prince\u2019s attention.\u201d\u201cHaha! That\u2019s too stupid. If she took the initiative to return the title deed to the Crown Prince, perhaps he would pity her. But now, she has really offended the Crown Prince thoroughly.\u201d\u201cThe Crown Prince has long given up on this marriage agreement. There will definitely be a good show to watch today.\u201dJust when the crowd was talking about this excitedly, the notification command rang outside the palace.\u201cChu family\u2019s First Elder\u2014Chu Xiao\u2014is here!\u201dThe palace instantly quietened down, and everyone looked over.They saw a line of people walking in.The first person was Chu family\u2019s First Elder\u2014Chu Xiao.Behind him was Chu Yan, Lu Yao, and Chu Xianmin.Chu Xianmin was wearing a long snow-white dress with flower embroidery. Her dress made her originally pretty face even more attractive. Her looks could be considered one of the top few in the entire Imperial City. In addition to her outstanding talent, she was also known as \u2018Imperial City\u2019s Most Beautiful Girl.\u2019Her presence immediately made the crowd\u2019s eyes light up. However, nobody dared to look charmed by her looks. After all, this was someone the Crown Prince had set his eyes on. Who would dare to fight with the Crown Prince?The crowd looked behind them and saw a handsome yet familiar face.\u201cChu Ning is here?\u201dSome people gasped.Chu Ning was very famous in the Imperial City earlier on, but ever since he got injured and was crippled, he did not appear in front of a crowd. His sudden appearance then made everyone remember that there was such a person.\u201cHe\u2019s Chu Liuyue\u2019s biological father. Of course, he had to come here and bear the responsibility\u2026\u201dSome guessed in secret.Everyone\u2019s gaze landed on Chu Ning, but he still looked calm and collected as if he did not notice the crowd.A young girl followed beside him. She looked younger than 13 or 14 years old, and she was decked in red. She was very skinny, but her back was straight.One look and the crowd confirmed that the young girl was Chu Liuyue.Almost everyone\u2019s eyes landed on her.She was never outstanding over the years, being an invalid. Yet, she secretly sold the hunting ground, humiliating the Crown Prince. How could this not attract the crowd\u2019s curiosity?In the crowd, the atmosphere became increasingly silent and stiff.The lights shone down brightly.She took a step forward, and the clear lights landed on her face.Everyone was shocked.Her innocent white face was in full view. Her brows looked as far as the mountains; her nose was high, and her lips were red without any makeup. It was an extremely clear and pretty face. Her pair of dark but shiny eyes attracted the crowd\u2019s attention the most. Her eyes were clear, clean, and pure.One look at her, and the crowd talked amongst themselves subconsciously.Her face still looked quite young; it was not hard to imagine how pretty she would look in a few years.The palace\u2019s atmosphere suddenly became special.Nobody expected the invalid from the Chu family to have such a mesmerizing face.Chu Xianmin noticed this, and her blood boiled. The hands in her sleeves clenched into fists; her delicately manicured nails dug into her skin, causing her to hurt. Chu Liuyue probably saw a ghost this month. Not only did her temperament change completely, but she even looks different.Chu Liuyue\u2019s original yellow and sickly face turned clear and pearly white. An indescribable composure also replaced her fearful eyes. Her five features clearly did not change much, but she looked way prettier than before.Before Chu Xianmin came, she was kind of worried that her limelight would be stolen away, and it indeed happened.Upon seeing her daughter\u2019s weird expression, Lu Yao silently pulled Chu Xianmin back.So what if Chu Liuyue became a little prettier? An invalid doesn\u2019t even have the right to become the Crown Princess. Chu Xianmin took a deep breath and suppressed her jealousy with much difficulty. I must destroy Chu Liuyue today.The crowd only recovered their senses and started muttering when the Chu family sat down.The palace regained its previous liveliness.Everyone looked happy and excited. However, their eyes were still on Chu Liuyue.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect the Chu family\u2019s invalid to be so pretty\u2026 Why didn\u2019t I hear about her before?\u201d\u201cOh, do you have any thoughts about her\u2026?\u201d\u201cHaha! The Crown Prince won\u2019t marry her for real. What\u2019s wrong with thinking about it? After all, it\u2019s hard to find such a beauty.\u201dThe young, aristocratic children bellowed with laughter.Chu Ning\u2019s face was ice-cold. Just as he was about to stand up, Chu Liuyue lightly pressed his hands down. He turned back and saw her shaking her head.The main star of the show today was Rong Jin. As for these people\u2026 she really did not need to spend any effort on them.Looking at her calm composure, Chu Ning did not insist any longer. He knew that his daughter was different from the past and that she definitely had her own ideas.Chu Ning did not realize that he already treated Chu Liuyue as his pillar of support subconsciously.\u201cThe Crown Prince is here!\u201dWhen the command sounded, the entire palace was silent once again.Chu Liuyue looked over and saw a dark purple figure appear in front of her.The figure had a considerably handsome face, but his gaze was cunning, which incurred people\u2019s wrath.She squinted her eyes. Crown Prince Rong Jin!The other party seemed to have noticed her looking at him and quickly glanced over.The two people\u2019s eyes met.Surprise flashed across Rong Jin\u2019s eyes. He had clearly not seen a girl of such beauty before. Even Chu Xianmin seemed ugly when compared to her.The next moment, he noticed that the young girl was actually sitting at the Chu family\u2019s seat.He instantly understood. She is Chu Liuyue!Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She even sold the hunting ground without consulting me, causing me to lose face in front of the imperial families\u2019 sons.If he didn\u2019t take his revenge by ten times or more, he would have been the Crown Prince for nothing!Rong Jin forced himself to suppress his anger and walked straight forward.The crowd was shocked to discover that he was actually heading towards Chu Liuyue.He looked condescendingly at Chu Liuyue while maintaining a calm demeanor, but anyone could see the turbulent waves beneath his seemingly calm disposition.Countless pairs of eyes stared intently at the two.First Elder and the others immediately stood up and bowed. \u201cPleased to meet Your Highness.\u201dHowever, Rong Jin ignored them. His eyes were trained on Chu Liuyue as he asked pointedly, \u201cAre you Chu Liuyue?\u201dChu Liuyue met his eyes and answered frankly. \u201cExactly.\u201dRong Jin slowly clenched his hands in his sleeves. He thought Chu Liuyue would panic, but the young girl before him was calm. He couldn\u2019t see any uneasiness in her at all! Where did she get her courage from?\u201cYou\u2019re not very old, but you have a lot of guts. I thought you wouldn\u2019t dare to come today.\u201dChu Liuyue blinked her eyes. \u201cWhat made you think that I wouldn\u2019t dare to come? Your Highness, didn\u2019t you send word to the Chu family and demand that I come today?\u201dRong Jin choked at once. Then, he sneered. \u201cYou really have a sharp tongue.\u201dChu Liuyue smiled and responded, \u201cThank you for your compliments, Your Highness.\u201dRong Jin glared at her before he turned around and headed towards his seat.First Elder turned and gave her a disgusted look. \u201cYou don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\u201cFirst Elder, if you wish to embarrass yourself in public, feel free to scold me,\u201d said Chu Liuyue lightly and sat down again calmly.It suddenly dawned on First Elder that they were in Mingcui Palace, not the Chu family estate.Everyone was waiting to see them make a fool of themselves. It would be bad if they made a scene now.After much self-restraint on his part, First Elder finally waved his sleeve violently and kept quiet.The Crown Prince obviously hated Chu Liuyue and was bound to throw a fit later. He would simply have to kick her out when the time came.\u2026The palace quickly resumed its bustle, but many people were still secretly checking out Chu Liuyue.She didn\u2019t seem to mind as she sat peacefully in her seat. In reality, she had already swiftly checked them out.Apart from the topmost position in the middle where His Majesty and the Empress were seated, the main hall was divided into two parts from the left and right.The ones sitting at the very front were the princes and princesses of noble status.As she had already inquired earlier, His Majesty had given birth to a total of nine princes and three princesses. Among whom three princes and one princess had died prematurely.Currently, there were only six princes and two princesses alive.Seated across from the Crown Prince was a man dressed in a black powerful suit. He looked about the same age as the Third Prince, but his features were rigid yet handsome. Even his temperament was completely different. He had a murderous aura. It could only be honed on the battlefield.He was the Third Prince, Rong Jiu.He joined the Northwest Army at the age of 15. As a young general, he had a prestigious reputation in the army. For this precise reason, he could stand up against the Crown Prince even though his birth mother was only a noble lady.The court had long been secretly divided into two factions. The Crown Prince might have the advantage, but Rong Jiu was also not to be underestimated.On Rong Jin\u2019s side was naturally the Fifth Prince, Rong Qi, who was born from the same mother. He was also one of the only two princes with a title other than the Crown Prince.The Eighth Princess and the Ninth Prince, Rong Shu and Rong Feng, were seated next to Rong Jiu. However, there were a few empty seats.Further back were the four great family clans\u2014Si, Gu, Chu, and Lu\u2014on both sides.The Chu family was seated behind the Gu family. The Lu family was seated opposite them, behind the Si family.Among the four families, the Si family was the most powerful while the Chu family was the weakest.Originally, the Chu family had enjoyed a higher status than the Lu family. But over the years, they had fallen out of favor while the Lu family surpassed them with their wealth and sat in the third position.Shortly after Rong Jin sat down, a burst of laughter suddenly came from outside the palace. At the same time, a loud and majestic summon could be heard.\u201cHis Majesty has arrived. The Empress has arrived.\u201dHere they come!Everyone rose quickly and bowed in unison towards the direction of the Emperor and his Empress.\u201cLong live His Majesty!\u201dChu Liuyue did the same as everyone else.\u201cHahaha. Everyone, rise. Today is the Prince\u2019s birthday banquet. There\u2019s no need to be so formal.\u201d A middle-aged man\u2019s powerful laughter rang throughout the palace. \u201cAlright. Zhen Zhen, go look for your brother too.\u201dOnly then did everyone see the Fourth Princess, Rong Zhen, who was behind the Empress. She was also born to the current Empress\u2014a true First Princess. She looked about 16 to 17 years old. Her gorgeous palace attire set off her face with increasing beauty.\u201cThen Father Emperor has promised Zhen Zhen?\u201dEmperor Jiawen smiled in favor. \u201cOf course! You\u2019re the most mischievous of all. Look at the rest of them. None can rival your trouble-making ability. If I don\u2019t agree, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to create a mess today.\u201dRong Zhen wrinkled her nose, but there was a coquettish smile on her face as she happily made her way to sit beside Rong Jin.Any fool could see how much Emperor Jiawen doted on her.Everyone sat only after the Empress had settled down.Chu Liuyue quickly looked up and stole a glance at the Emperor.Emperor Jiawen, Rong Xiao.The last time she saw him was during the Grand Court Meeting.All of Tianling Dynasty\u2019s affiliated countries would come to seek an audience during the Grand Court Meeting, which was held once every three years.Those of Rong Xiao\u2019s status, however, could only stand at the very end. They basically didn\u2019t even have the right to speak to her. But she had an excellent memory. She was already preparing to take over her father\u2019s position at that time, so she was very careful to remember everyone\u2019s appearance and their relationship with each other.Compared to that time, Rong Xiao seemed to have aged. His face and aura were very different. Yes, at that time, he was humble and could only stand among the crowd, looking up to her from afar.Now, however, his and her position had been completely flipped!She quickly withdrew her gaze after only one glance.Emperor Jiawen was aware of the strange gaze falling on him. But when he tried to look, he didn\u2019t find anything unusual.As soon as Rong Zhen sat down, she saw the gloomy look on Rong Jin\u2019s face. She suddenly recalled something and looked toward the Chu family.She only managed to see a slender frame because Chu Liuyue was seated in the second row.She leaned close to Rong Jin and asked softly, \u201cIs that her?\u201dRong Jin muttered a \u2018hmm.\u2019\u201cHmph! Who does she think she is? Don\u2019t worry, Brother. I\u2019ll help you out.\u201dRong Jin moved his eyebrows but made no attempt to stop her. This was a tacit acceptance.Rong Zhen was rude and arrogant, and she always did things out of the ordinary. However, because her parents doted on her, nothing would happen to her even if she made a mess of things.As the Crown Prince, he would be at a disadvantage if he got himself into trouble with a woman because of a hunting ground. It would be perfect for Rong Zhen to step in.In the middle of the conversation, Rong Zhen opened her mouth and asked loudly, \u201cI\u2019m sure this is the \u2018famous\u2019 Miss Chu, right?\u201dEveryone quiet down. Then, they immediately realized that Rong Zhen was going to find fault with Chu Liuyue.Chu Liuyue raised her eyes.Rong Zhen smiled unkindly and said, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you much throughout all these years. Today, I feel like I\u2019ve seen you for the first time. I plan to give you a gift for our first meeting.\u201d With that, she clapped her hands.\u201cSomeone, come and present the treasure that I won the day before yesterday.\u201dLiked it?

The crowd couldn\u2019t guess what was inside. However, Chu Liuyue could smell the light fishy scent, and she narrowed her eyes.Rong Zhen stepped forward and pulled the cloth away.Shua!A golden-yellow python was coiled up inside the cage. Its body was as thick as a human thigh. Its layers of pale golden scales reflected the cold lighting. Its blood-red vertical pupils were more like two sharp daggers, cruel and indifferent. It was a Golden Python, a third-grade beast.The sudden sight of light caused it to be alert. It raised its huge head, showed its fangs, and made hissing sounds which sounded creepy.The crowd in the palace were taken aback by the sudden revelation of this huge creature. Even Emperor Jiawen, who was seated up there, appeared to be surprised.He then followed Rong Zhen\u2019s line of sight and looked over. A young girl\u2019s unfamiliar face appeared before him.In his heart, he already knew that it was the Big Missy of the Chu family, Chu Ning\u2019s daughter\u2014Chu Liuyue\u2014who had a marriage agreement with Rong Jin.\u201cZhen Zhen, what are you doing?\u201d asked Emperor Jiawen. \u201cThis is your brother\u2019s birthday banquet, not the place for you to fool around.\u201d He remembered that Chu Liuyue was born with a lacking Yuan meridian and that she was unable to cultivate for her entire life.How was she going to handle this third-grade Golden Python? He wasn\u2019t concerned about Chu Liuyue, but she had an existing marriage agreement with Rong Jin. It wouldn\u2019t be good if things got ugly. Besides, if he indulged Rong Zhen with so many pairs of eyes on them, people would think that the royal family was ruthless. They would think that they treated Chu Liuyue so shabbily because she was a loser.Instead, Rong Zhen laughed. \u201cFather, this is my first time meeting Big Missy Chu. I like her so much that I want to give her the Golden Python that I tried extremely hard to obtain. I caught it myself. I initially wanted to keep it as a pet, but my meeting with Miss Chu is fated. I am willing to part with it, no matter how painful it is for me.\u201dShe looked at Chu Liuyue and said, \u201cI\u2019m guessing that Big Chu Missy hasn\u2019t obtained a contracted fiend yet, right?\u201dA few snickers came from the crowd.What kind of contracted fiend could a good-for-nothing have?Quite a number of eyes sarcastically landed on Chu Liuyue as they waited for a good show to start.Rong Zhen pulled a face as though she was displeased. \u201cWhat? Is it possible that Big Chu Missy doesn\u2019t care for the Golden Python that I\u2019m giving her?\u201d She was the most favored true-born princess of the country. Who would dare to say they didn\u2019t like what she was giving them?Chu Liuyue stood up. \u201cThe Fourth Princess is so kind. I am very grateful from the bottom of my heart. Why wouldn\u2019t I like it?\u201dOnly then did Rong Zhen smile again. She crooked a finger at Chu Liuyue as though she was summoning a lowly servant. \u201cSince you are so grateful to me, why don\u2019t you come here and accept your gift?\u201dChu Liuyue paused for a moment before moving forward. She first bowed to Emperor Jiawen, then she looked at Rong Zhen and bowed again. Her movements were very standardized, but they were even better executed than any of the palace\u2019s training sisters.All her movements were as smooth as a flowing river; it was pleasing to the eyes. Most importantly, she was carrying herself like royalty. Her disposition was more distinguished than that of the true-born princess, Rong Zhen, herself.Despite the fact that she was wearing old clothes with frayed edges, and her small face was unpainted, she stood out more strikingly than the gorgeous Princess Rong Zhen\u2014who had dressed with care for the occasion.Like a pearl, she would be the first to attract everyone\u2019s attention in any location.Some people couldn\u2019t help but whisper among themselves.\u201cIsn\u2019t Chu Liuyue a born good-for-nothing and was thrown into the pile of inferiors since she was a child? How is it that she is so well-mannered?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of strange! No one in the Chu family even took her seriously, so how can they be teaching her this? Was she taught specifically before entering the palace?\u201d The voice of the person who said this gradually diminished.All of them came from great families, so they naturally knew very well that these rules could not be learned in a matter of a day. That noble and elegant temperament simply couldn\u2019t be cultivated overnight.\u201c\u2026 How is that possible? Even Chu Xianmin didn\u2019t have such nobility and elegance.\u201d\u201cNot to mention Chu Xianmin, don\u2019t you see that even the Fourth Princess can\u2019t be compared to her?\u201dThe crowd didn\u2019t dare to say this openly. But with one look exchanged after another, they knew what everyone else was thinking.Rong Zhen definitely sensed this too. A surge of anger arose from within her. What is Chu Liuyue pretending to be? She didn\u2019t believe that this loser could stir any waves. \u201cMiss Chu, although this python is my gift to you, there is a condition.\u201dRong Zhen\u2019s scarlet lips curved into a smile as she pointed at the Golden Python. \u201cThis is a newly-captured Golden Python. It is wild and untamed. If you want to be its master, you will have to defeat it. So, how about you fight it instead?\u201dThe atmosphere froze instantly. Nobody expected Rong Zhen to make such a request.Chu Liuyue is a loser. She will only die if she fights the third-grade Golden Python. Emperor Jiawen frowned without waiting for Chu Liuyue to speak. \u201cZhen Zhen, stop your nonsense!\u201dThe smile on Rong Zhen\u2019s face disappeared, and she said coldly, \u201cFather, I am not messing around. I\u2019m doing this for a reason! Do you know that she sold the hunting ground belonging to my brother, the Crown Prince, for private use?\u201dEmperor Jiawen was stunned. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBrother put in a lot of effort into that hunting ground. In the end, it was all for naught! He had been generous enough to leave her alone, but as his sister, I can\u2019t stand it. This Golden Python might be a third-grade fiend. However, it can\u2019t compare to what Brother has lost!\u201dShe raised her voice as she looked at Chu Liuyue. \u201cAre you going to admit it or not?\u201dEmperor Jiawen finally recalled that he had indeed given a hunting ground to Chu Liuyue. She actually sold it? In any case, it was something I personally bestowed to her. How could she sell it away so casually?This caused Emperor Jiawen to harbor some dissatisfaction toward Chu Liuyue. But if he were to agree with Rong Zhen\u2019s proposition, it was possible that Chu Liuyue might not live until the end of the day.\u201cYour Majesty, Chu Ning is willing to atone for my daughter\u2019s sins.\u201d At this moment, Chu Ning suddenly stepped forward and knelt on one knee.Emperor Jiawen\u2019s attitude somewhat relented slightly when he saw Chu Ning. After pondering for a while, he finally nodded. \u201cThis is possible.\u201d Although Chu Ning was no longer the same, it shouldn\u2019t be too dangerous for him to deal with a third-grade Golden Python. Moreover, he was Chu Liuyue\u2019s father. It would be most appropriate for him to step in.On the one hand, it saved the Crown Prince and the royal family from embarrassment; on the other hand, the father-daughter duo\u2019s lives wouldn\u2019t be in real danger.In that instant, Chu Liuyue suddenly stepped forward. \u201cI am willing to try.\u201dRong Zhen had been annoyed about losing an opportunity to teach Chu Liuyue a lesson, but she didn\u2019t expect her to take the initiative to come forward on her own!\u201cWhat did you say? Say that again.\u201dChu Liuyue raised her chin. Her black and pure eyes were as brilliant as the stars. \u201cI said that I am willing to try. I will fight the Golden Python.\u201dLiked it?

She must be courting her own death.\u201cYue\u2019er!\u201d Chu Ning was also taken aback, and he tugged at Chu Liuyue\u2019s sleeve. \u201cThis Golden Python is fierce and much more powerful than any ordinary third-grade fiend. You\u2026\u201dChu Liuyue merely looked at him and smiled. \u201cFather, don\u2019t worry.\u201dMiraculously, these words soothed Chu Ning\u2019s troubled and worried heart. It was as if she had a magical power within her. Subconsciously, it made people believe in her. If she said not to worry, then all would be fine.Chu Ning moved his lips. He had already guessed that her Yuan meridian was fully repaired, and she had most likely started cultivating. However, how could she be a match for a third-grade fiend within such a short period of time?After repeatedly struggling with himself, Chu Ning finally swallowed his words and nodded gravely. \u201cI believe in you.\u201dThis warmed Chu Liuyue\u2019s heart. This feeling of being trusted unconditionally was most reassuring.Rong Zhen naturally wouldn\u2019t let go of this opportunity. She immediately declared, \u201cYou agreed on your own accord. I have nothing to do with this, regardless of the outcome.\u201dChu Liuyue mocked Rong Zhen in her heart. No ordinary person can display such shameless behavior in public.Emperor Jiawen hesitated as he exchanged a look with his empress.The Empress nodded her head and whispered, \u201cYour Majesty, this concerns the royal family after all. Wouldn\u2019t it be enough to teach her a lesson in person and have her protected?\u201dEmperor Jiawen was deeply impressed, so he specially sent a few guards to rescue Chu Liuyue immediately if something did go wrong.Nevertheless, the crowd wasn\u2019t as optimistic.They all thought Chu Liuyue was courting death.Rong Zhen smiled proudly as she turned to reclaim her seat. However, Chu Liuyue stopped her.\u201cFourth Princess, please wait.\u201dRong Zhen turned back impatiently. \u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cThe Fourth Princess has given me such a great gift. I am deeply touched, so I have also prepared a gift in return for your kindness. It will be sent to you later. Please kindly accept it.\u201dRong Zhen sneered contemptuously. \u201cYou\u2019re only a\u2026 Fine. Just deliver it later.\u201d A loser who has been disregarded by her waning aristocratic family. What good can she do? It\u2019s ridiculous!She walked over to Rong Jin and winked complacently.The corners of Rong Jin\u2019s lips curled ever so slightly. He gave her an affirmative look and quickly restrained himself.In the center of the palace, there was only Chu Liuyue and the Golden Python that was trapped in the huge black cage.Chu Liuyue slowly walked toward the Golden Python until she was in front of it.A woman and a beast faced off.\u201cAudacious fool.\u201d Chu Xianmin was relieved by what she saw.There were plenty of people that would deal with Chu Liuyue without her having to do anything!Everyone quieted down unconsciously.\u2026The Golden Python was inherently fierce. On top of that, Rong Zhen hadn\u2019t subdued the beast on her own. Instead, she rounded it up and used every trick in her sleeve to capture it. Moreover, Rong Zhen had deliberately starved it for the past few days. The python was on the verge of extreme violence, waiting to explode. This was even more dangerous than an ordinary python!Initially, Rong Zhen wanted to tame this Golden Python and have some fun with it. However, today she heard about what happened with Rong Jin, and she knew Chu Liuyue would be present. Thus, she ordered the python to be brought here specifically for this occasion to teach Chu Liuyue a lesson.Chu Liuyue took one glance and surmised that they were trying to give her a hard time.Hiss!The Golden Python, with its hostile eyes, turned more manic once it sensed Chu Liuyue\u2019s scent.She headed straight for the guard beside her and cupped her hands together. \u201cMay I borrow your sword?\u201dThe stunned guard subconsciously looked towards Emperor Jiawen.Emperor Jiawen nodded. \u201cGive it to her.\u201dOnly then did the guard remove the sword at his waist and hand it to Chu Liuyue.\u201cThank you.\u201d She took the sword and waved it around with fluid motions. The blade is too heavy and not sharp enough; the materials used for forging the sword are also not good enough. Nevertheless, the sword is sufficient.\u201cSeems like she has some skills.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a charade! Her Yuan meridian is crippled, and she can\u2019t even absorb force. What can she do?\u201d\u201cTrue. Maybe she asked for a sword to give herself some courage.\u201dChu Liuyue ignored them. She took half a step back with one foot, gripped the hilt of her sword with both hands, and raised it over her head.She whirled it and struck down hard.Clang!A spark ignited. The chain to the cage actually snapped in response!Everyone was horrified!What\u2026 is she trying to do?Without waiting for anyone to understand, Chu Liuyue had already tipped the sword. The cage opened wide instantly.The Golden Python realized that the cage imprisoning it had been unlocked. It dashed out immediately.Its gigantic head lunged at Chu Liuyue without hesitation. It opened its mouth, revealing the sharp fangs.A mouth like that could kill, if not inflict some serious damage.In contrast to its huge size, Chu Liuyue looked extraordinarily small and delicate, as if the python could swallow her whole in a second.Right at this moment, Chu Liuyue advanced instead of retreating. She pointed her toes and leaped forward using that momentum.At the same time, the sword stabbed quickly. It went straight at the python\u2019s belly.The python\u2019s scales were extremely tough and couldn\u2019t be pierced by an ordinary sword. The only entry point of attack would be its abdomen, a softer area.The Golden Python also sensed Chu Liuyue\u2019s intentions; it immediately flicked its tail and slapped Chu Liuyue hard!It was too strong physically. If it smacked Chu Liuyue, she would die on the spot. However, Chu Liuyue was so swift on her feet that she somehow narrowly avoided the blow and circled to the side of the Golden Python.She stabbed at it without hesitation.Zing\u2026The longsword sliced along the hard scales, making a piercing sound. Yet, there was only a light, white scratch. There wasn\u2019t even a trace of blood!Rong Zhen sneered. \u201cBrother, Chu Liuyue is really stupid to think\u2026 What?\u201dBefore she had even finished her taunting words, the situation changed dramatically.That attack from Chu Liuyue had completely enraged the Golden Python. It flicked its tail frantically in an attempt to entangle Chu Liuyue.But she suddenly released the sword\u2019s hilt and leaped onto it. By using this leverage, Chu Liuyue actually went straight for the python\u2019s head!She wrapped one arm around the python\u2019s neck and swiftly removed the hairpin in her hair with the other and thrust it into the snake\u2019s eye.Its eyes were its greatest weakness!Fizz!Blood splattered everywhere.The Golden Python let out an angry and painful shriek, but Chu Liuyue plucked out its eyeball without hesitation.The python shifted its body violently. There was nothing it could do to Chu Liuyue.In the blink of an eye, the second eyeball was picked out too!The python gradually went limp.Finally, Chu Liuyue jumped down, picked up her sword, and thrust it straight into the bloody hole.One harsh stroke!Just like that, she cut the snake open and beheaded it.\u201cAh!\u201d Some of the dainty noble ladies screamed at this bloody scene.Chu Liuyue, however, didn\u2019t even flinch. She reached in and probed with her hand before pulling out a turquoise pearl\u2014the Golden Python\u2019s essence! Chu Liuyue then walked towards Rong Zhen\u2014who had already stiffened\u2014stretched out her bloodied hand, and presented the pearl.\u201cFourth Princess, this is my gift in return. Take a look.

She could actually smile! She looked like a demon from hell.Rong Zhen suddenly felt a chill. At this moment, a thought occurred to her: Chu Liuyue is not an easy target to bully like she appears to be.Chu Liuyue held something out. \u201cFourth Princess, the Golden Python\u2019s essence is very nourishing to the body. Please\u2026\u201dIt was still sticky and stained with blood. The fishy smell made one nauseous.Rong Zhen\u2019s face went pale. Nevertheless, so many pairs of eyes were looking at them, so she had to accept the \u2018gift in return.\u2019Just when she was in a dilemma, Rong Jin\u2014who was sitting beside her\u2014suddenly spoke. \u201cSomeone come and take this gift from Miss Chu.\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, a guard beside him immediately stepped forward with the intention of receiving the pearl on behalf of the princess. However, Chu Liuyue avoided the guard\u2019s hand and continued to stare intently at Rong Zhen.\u201cInitially, I thought it belonged to me because my name was on it, and I could do whatever I pleased with it since it was my belonging. However, I didn\u2019t expect my actions would provoke the Fourth Princess, enraging her. If so, please allow me to apologize to Your Majesty and Your Highness. It\u2019s a pity that the Fourth Princess doesn\u2019t seem to care for my gift, or is it not good enough for you?\u201dRong Zhen\u2019s heart skipped a beat. She might be wilful and petulant, but she wasn\u2019t a fool. Chu Liuyue was asking her to accept the gift personally. If she didn\u2019t, her earlier demands on Chu Liuyue would seem mean.So many people, including her father and mother, were watching her every move.It was no big deal if she tarnished her own reputation. After all, she had always had such a temper. However, she couldn\u2019t afford to have the royal family be criticized because of her. She was able to please the Empress in large part because she knew the limits, even though she always messed around.\u201cOf course, your Princess is satisfied with your gift.\u201d Rong Zhen gritted her teeth, stood up, and got the guard to stand down while she accepted the Golden Python\u2019s essence.It was so sticky and disgusting that she almost threw it away!Rong Zhen thought she would be able to teach Chu Liuyue a well-deserved lesson, but in the end, the latter managed to turn the table around.She stared at Chu Liuyue with a deadly glare and said through gritted teeth, \u201cChu. Liu. Yue. You are good! Your Princess will remember you!\u201dChu Liuyue smiled faintly and bowed. \u201cThank you for remembering me, Princess.\u201dRong Zhen was so choked up with anger that she almost exploded.\u201cOkay,\u201d reminded Rong Jin.Rong Zhen could only suppress her anger.Rong Jin gave her a look as if he was unhappy. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you go and clean up? You look so dirty. What impression are you trying to make?\u201dThe moment he finished, there was silence in the palace.The Crown Prince seemed to be talking about the Fourth Princess, but in reality, he was indirectly targeting Chu Liuyue.The Fourth Princess merely had a little blood staining her hands. Chu Liuyue, on the other hand, was covered in blood from her earlier fight with the Golden Python.\u2018Dirty\u2019 was the exact description for the current Chu Liuyue.Soft snickering could be heard throughout the palace.All eyes, filled with mockery and ridicule, were on her.Everyone was well-dressed and clean in the brightly lit Ming Cui Palace.She was the only one covered in blood. Her hair was down and scattered because she had removed her hairpin. She was a mess.This was the sight that greeted Rong Xiu when he entered the palace.A skinny young girl stood in the center of the palace. Beside her were a huge, broken black cage and the Golden Python\u2019s bloodied corpse.The floor was covered in bloodstains.The girl\u2019s side profile and hands were also covered in blood. She might be thin, but her back was straight like the cypress tree on a mountain cliff. It never bent, no matter how hard the wind blew.His warm, clear eyes instantly turned dark and cold. He regained his usual gentle look in the next second.\u201cPrince Li has arrived!\u201d The announcement broke the atmosphere in the palace. Everyone\u2019s eyes widened in shock.Prince Li?The Seventh Prince?What is he doing here?He returned to the Imperial City a month ago but had not attended any banquets because he had been sick. Why today\u2026Chu Liuyue felt her heart stir, and she looked back unconsciously.A familiar silhouette appeared at the palace door.The octagonal glazed palace lamp hanging outside the palace door cast a soft, warm light, reflecting his tall and long figure.Chu Liuyue was stunned. He was actually wearing a white fox cloak in the middle of summer.His features became clearer as he walked into the palace.Although this wasn\u2019t her first time seeing his face, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from falling into a daze.Rong Xiu had eyebrows that slanted towards his temples\u2014which resembled two swords\u2014profound phoenix eyes that were like the brilliant stars in the Milky Way, and a high nose.One look from him was enough to make a person melt willingly.Within the cloak, he was dressed in a snow-white brocade coat with dark-gold patterns embroidered on the cuffs and hem. He seemed to be gliding on the moonlight.Only one thought occurred in everyone\u2019s mind with his appearance: like a well-cut and polished rogue gentleman.He looked really noble, regal, and as warm as a piece of jade.Some noble ladies were flushing and stared at him with adoring eyes.\u201cSo\u2026 this is Prince Li. I never thought he was so handsome!\u201d\u201cThe last time he returned to the Imperial City was three years ago. I didn\u2019t expect to see him back again with such a demeanor. Nobody in the city can compare to him in terms of looks.\u201d\u201cHumph! What is there to see? He\u2019s just a sick kid. At the end of the day, he\u2019s nothing more than an idle prince.\u201dThere were whispers in the palace.Chu Liuyue looked closer, and her eyebrows rose.It wasn\u2019t surprising that those people had said all this. Rong Xiu\u2019s lips were pale, and he did look weak.At this moment, Rong Xiu\u2019s attention shifted, and he looked at Chu Liuyue.Their eyes met.Chu Liuyue squinted her eyes.In the next moment, Rong Xiu was actually making his way toward her until he stood before her.Everyone was looking at her strangely.Chu Liuyue froze. What is he planning to do? Is he here to settle the score because I trespassed into Bibo Lake last time?While she was thinking about this, she saw Rong Xiu suddenly extend his hand and hand her a handkerchief that was white as snow.Chu Liuyue immediately understood his intentions.He wanted her to wipe the bloodstains on her face.The circumstances of when she first met him resurfaced in her mind.That time, he had reached out, wiped the bloodstains on her face with his fingertip, and said, \u201cLady Chu, you can\u2019t go home in such a mess with blood on your face.\u201dThe situation this time was so similar.Chu Liuyue accepted his handkerchief and bowed with gratitude. \u201cThank you, Your Highness.\u201dRong Xiu looked at the young girl\u2019s curls of hair and her well-mannered demeanor that was a stark difference from her earlier wariness. His mood improved instantly.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It seemed like he had been sick for a long time.Emperor Jiawen shook his head with some disapproval. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a weak constitution ever since you were a child. You must take good care of yourself now that you\u2019ve just returned to the Imperial City. Why are you pushing yourself by coming?\u201dRong Xiu looked smilingly at Rong Jin. \u201cIt is Brother\u2019s birthday banquet. As his brother and his subject, how can I not come?\u201dRong Jin sneered inwardly, but he wore a smile on his face. \u201cSeventh Brother, you\u2019re being too polite. It\u2019s only a birthday. I\u2019ll feel bad if your sickness gets worse. Quickly, sit!\u201dRong Xiu followed his advice and took his seat beside the Third Prince, Rong Jiu.He coughed a few times after removing his cloak. It seemed that he was suffering on this trip.The crowd exchanged looks among themselves.Indeed, Prince Li looked like he was in bad shape.Some noble ladies were disappointed. He might have the looks, but there wouldn\u2019t be much of a future with his weak body. A pity. He was so handsome and exuded such a magnificent presence.Rong Xiu didn\u2019t seem to care. He sat, greeted a few people around him, and quieted down.What a gentle and humble gentleman.Rong Zhen had no impression of her seventh brother. However, she was disgusted by him after he offered his handkerchief to Chu Liuyue. She sneered and turned her attention from Chu Liuyue to him. \u201cBrother, you seem to care greatly for Big Chu Missy. Is it possible that you already know each other?\u201dRong Xiu simply smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve only been back to the Imperial City for a month. This is my first outing. How can I know anyone?\u201dRong Zhen remained skeptical. \u201cThen why did you help her?\u201dRong Xiu\u2019s smile slightly faltered. \u201cI just feel that it\u2019s really not good to see blood as today is my brother\u2019s birthday banquet. Besides\u2026 I\u2019m late. I don\u2019t know what happened earlier, and this place is actually in such a mess?\u201dHe poured himself a cup of tea and casually said, \u201cIf I remember correctly, Miss Chu is engaged to my brother. I wonder who is bold enough to treat the Crown Prince\u2019s wife-to-be in such a manner on his birthday banquet.\u201dRong Zhen choked.Rong Jin looked even more embarrassed.Wasn\u2019t he being accused of letting others bully Chu Liuyue under his nose?The Empress sensed that things had taken a wrong turn. She said warmly, \u201cPrince Li must be mistaken. Rong Zhen felt close to her even though it was their first meeting, and she wanted to give the Golden Python to Miss Chu. They were merely taming the python earlier.\u201dRong Xiu was a little surprised. \u201cTame the Golden Python? Big Chu Missy is born with a crippled Yuan meridian, and she can\u2019t cultivate. How can she possibly tame it?\u201d His perplexed question made the Empress and the others suddenly feel extremely embarrassed.Rong Jin frowned. He felt that Rong Xiu had set the trap on purpose. However, judging from his shocked expression, he seemed to be asking the question out of genuine concern. Besides, Rong Xiu shouldn\u2019t know about what happened to the hunting ground. Rong Jin couldn\u2019t tell what Rong Xiu was thinking for a while, so he didn\u2019t say anything.Rong Zhen, however, couldn\u2019t stop herself from arguing. \u201cShe obviously made the mistake of selling the deed for Brother\u2019s hunting ground to others! She has gone too far by doing that.\u201dAfter a moment\u2019s silence, Rong Xiu asked as he fondled his teacup, \u201cHow did she do that if the deed belongs to the Crown Prince?\u201dThere was dead silence in the palace.Everyone naturally knew her name was on the deed, but anyone with a brain could tell that the Crown Prince highly valued the hunting ground.The fact that she sold it meant she was screwing the Crown Prince over big time!The Crown Prince was furious. He obviously wanted to deal with her today. Otherwise, why would a loser from the Chu family have the right to be present at a palace banquet?Everyone was well-aware of this. Even the Empress had acquiesced to it.When a man of Prince Li\u2019s status had pointed this out, it made the Crown Prince look exceptionally bad.Chu Liuyue wiped the bloodstains off with the white handkerchief as she hid a smile. Since Rong Xiu had the intention to help her, she would seize this opportunity. \u201cYour Highness, there is something you might be unaware of. Although my name is on the deed, it is still my fault for selling it away just like that because the Crown Prince and I have not been officially engaged. Earlier, the Fourth Princess also promised to let the matter rest if I can tame the Golden Python. Am I right, Princess?\u201dRong Zhen glared at her with bulging eyes. \u201cWhen did I say that? Don\u2019t put words in my mouth!\u201dChu Liuyue looked at Emperor Jiawen in confusion. \u201cIs that not what you meant, Your Majesty?\u201dEmperor Jiawen didn\u2019t expect Chu Liuyue to be so direct, and he felt embarrassed. He coughed and waved his hand. \u201cIt is just a hunting ground. Since Liuyue has already tamed the Golden Python as agreed, let\u2019s leave it at that. Zhen Zhen, you\u2019re not to talk about this again.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t just a warning for Rong Zhen alone, but also for everyone present.Rong Zhen was annoyed, but when she saw the seriousness in Emperor Jiawen\u2019s eyes, she could only agree reluctantly. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThank you, Your Majesty.\u201d Chu Liuyue had no intention of letting it go so lightly. She sighed softly and wore an aggrieved expression. \u201cYour Majesty, I know in my heart that you personally granted the title deed to me all those years ago, and I naturally treasure it very much. However, I would have never sold the deed if I had not been forced to do so.\u201dEmperor Jiawen was stunned. \u201cWhat is it? Is there something else?\u201dChu Liuyue breathed deeply. \u201cYour Majesty, life hasn\u2019t been easy because I was born with a crippled Yuan meridian, and my father had been seriously injured many years ago. If I had a choice, I wouldn\u2019t have to sell the deed away to raise some taels to sustain our living\u2026\u201dFirst Elder stood up immediately and shouted out in anger. \u201cChu Liuyue! What nonsense are you babbling?\u201d Is she trying to implicate the entire Chu family?Emperor Jiawen looked displeased as he glanced at First Elder. \u201cLet her speak!\u201dFirst Elder was furious, but he didn\u2019t dare to interject anymore.\u201cThere was a time when my father and I sought help from the Crown Prince, but we couldn\u2019t even meet him. Before I sold the deed, I tried to talk to the Crown Prince about it. Alas, I was turned away. So\u2026\u201dRong Jin turned blue as he listened. This is some story from Chu Liuyue!\u201cOut of desperation, I was forced to do what I did. Your Majesty, I seek your wise judgment.\u201d Chu Liuyue\u2019s words were half-true, but the people in the palace were inclined to believe her.Almost everyone in the Imperial City knew what kind of lives Chu Liuyue and her father were living. It was entirely possible that the Crown Prince had shut her out.Wasn\u2019t it normal for the Crown Prince to do this when he loathed her so much?If that was what happened, then Chu Liuyue wasn\u2019t to blame.Emperor Jiawen looked more dignified when he looked at Rong Jin. \u201cCrown Prince, I\u2019m sure you have put in a lot of effort into that hunting ground. However, if you hadn\u2019t neglected Liuyue all these years, she also wouldn\u2019t have done this. If my memory serves me well, her birthday is in two days. You will be formally\u2026\u201dRong Jin\u2019s heart skipped a beat. Is it possible that Emperor Jiawen wants me to fulfill my marriage agreement with Chu Liuyue? Absolutely no way!Rong Jin jumped out of his seat at this thought. \u201cFather, I have a request.\u201d He pointed at Chu Liuyue. \u201cI wish to dissolve my marriage agreement with Chu Liuyue!\u201dLiked it?

Rong Jin had initially planned to use this incident to sow discord between Emperor Jiawen and her. Thus, bringing about the dissolution of their marriage agreement.He didn\u2019t expect things to turn out like this. Chu Liuyue had a valid reason to sell the deed, and it was the result of her being bullied by the Chu family and him. He had no way of pulling himself out of this mess. It was a waste of time to dwell on this. Besides, the situation had become worse. This evening\u2019s events had put the royal family at a disadvantage.He knew this was something his father wouldn\u2019t want. He had to cut the Gordian knot and propose to dissolve their marriage agreement immediately to make a clean break. Even if it resulted in him being criticized, it was better than his father having dissatisfaction with him.Emperor Jiawen was silent; his expression solemn.It was so quiet in the palace that one could hear a pin drop.A penny for a pound. Rong Jin stated bluntly, \u201cFather, I have no feelings for Big Chu Missy. Even if we marry, we wouldn\u2019t be happy. It would be better for us all if we dissolve the marriage agreement.\u201dChu Liuyue\u2019s lowered her eyes to hide her contempt.This man was not only irresponsible; he was also cunning and sinister. He gave such a grand presentation because he felt that she was a loser and unworthy of his status as Crown Prince. Throughout their years of having this marriage agreement, he had never said he wanted to dissolve the agreement. Instead, he chose this moment to bring it up.Naturally, Chu Liuyue could guess his reason. He was a noble prince, whereas she was a born loser. If he had brought this matter up sooner, he would be ridiculed for being a snob.He lived an indulgent life without any care while Chu Liuyue suffered in the Chu family. Perhaps, he knew that she wouldn\u2019t live past the age of 14. If she had died sooner, he would have resolved a major problem without breaking a sweat. Never did he expect her to retaliate against him!With what happened today, he must propose the dissolution of their marriage agreement.Emperor Jiawen narrowed his eyes. Nobody could read his thoughts.\u201cHave you considered this?\u201d Emperor Jiawen spoke in a deep voice a while later.Rong Xiu suddenly advised warmly. \u201cCrown Prince, Miss Chu is actually quite nice. Didn\u2019t she tame the Golden Python earlier? Even though she doesn\u2019t have force in her body, it seems she may have the strength after what happened.\u201dRong Jin\u2019s face fell. In fact, he was quite shocked when Chu Liuyue killed that Golden Python just now. But after careful observation, he had not sensed any force fluctuating within her.The main reason Chu Liuyue won was that she was ingenious enough to find the Golden Python\u2019s weakness and attacked it with all her might.This kind of strategy was fine when used once or twice. It would be ineffective when overused.The bottom line was strength.After more than ten years of having a crippled Yuan meridian, could Chu Liuyue have recovered? At this thought, Rong Jin replied with certainty. \u201cYes, I have.\u201dHe was going to inherit the throne in the future. Someone like Chu Liuyue would be a stain to his status. \u201cOf course, in order to compensate for the harm caused, I am willing to make amends to Miss Chu.\u201d As he said that, he looked at Chu Liuyue. \u201cFeel free to state your terms. I will do my best to satisfy them.\u201dIs he attempting to put me down further, or is he trying to erect a benevolent plaque for himself? How in the world could anything be so good? Chu Liuyue lifted her chin, looked at Rong Jin, and pursed her lips. \u201cYour Highness, you\u2026 Actually, I once admired you\u2026\u201dRong Xiu, who had just lifted his teacup, froze. He then set the teacup down as though nothing was amiss. His eyes scanned the girl before him.Chu Liuyue felt a chill at the back of her head suddenly and inexplicably.As Rong Jin listened, he frowned. Is Chu Liuyue unwilling to break off the engagement? Maybe. Even if she is stupid, she knows how precious the position of Crown Princess is. A moment ago, she deliberately accused me of neglecting her and her father. Now, she says she admires me? She is indeed a greedy girl!The thoughts that Rong Jin had when he saw Chu Liuyue\u2019s face earlier had completely vanished. He cut her off impatiently. \u201cI told you. State your terms. There\u2019s no need to say anything else.\u201dChu Liuyue\u2019s lips were pale. Her eyelashes quivered, followed by a bitter smile. \u201cYour Highness, please don\u2019t worry. I know I\u2019m unworthy of you, so I\u2019ve never deluded myself. I know there is another person in your heart.\u201d As she said that, her eyes drifted toward Chu Xianmin. \u201cIn the past, I never had the chance to attend any of your birthday banquets. Third Sister would always describe the parties to me vividly whenever she came back. I didn\u2019t get to see you much throughout all these years. Third Sister would tell me everything about you. That\u2019s the only way I could get to know you.\u201dShe paused and lowered her head. Her voice was calm and clear. It made her audience\u2019s hearts ache for her.\u201cShe knows what tea you like to drink, what books you like to read, and what incense to burn to make you sleep more soundly\u2026 I, on the other hand, know nothing.\u201dChu Xianmin\u2019s heart skipped a beat. This is not right! Why does this sound so wrong?As the crowd in the palace listened, they began to work out what was going on. Eyes began to fall on Chu Xianmin.It didn\u2019t sound like she had good intentions; she was clearly showing off on purpose! How dare she say all that when she knew for a fact that Chu Liuyue and the Crown Prince had a marriage agreement?Besides\u2026To know his preferred tea and books was one thing, but she even knew the incense he burnt when he sleeps. This was\u2026\u201cTsk tsk. I thought Third Missy was extremely talented, gentle, and virtuous. I didn\u2019t expect her to be so bold.\u201d\u201cThere are countless noble ladies in the Imperial City. Why is the Crown Prince partial to her? So that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\u201cEven if Chu Liuyue is useless, she\u2019s still her sister. But treating her like this, heh! What kind of woman gets together with a man who is engaged to their sister?\u201d\u201cShe looks quiet and virtuous. Who knows what is underneath that facade?\u201dChu Xianmin\u2019s face reddened as if a fire wildly burned in her chest!Chu Liuyue\u2019s words had directly ruined her reputation!She stood up without a thought and snapped with a shriek. \u201cB*tch! What nonsense are you talking about? I\u2019ll rip your mouth off!\u201dEveryone heard the insult clearly.Chu Xianmin panicked as soon as the words came out of her mouth. Her shrewish actions were bound to displease the Empress and the Crown Prince!She looked toward Rong Jin and saw that his expression had indeed turned from shock to disgust.Chu Xianmin\u2019s heart sank all the way to the abyss, but Chu Liuyue sighed as if she was relieved of a great burden.\u201cYour Highness and Third Sister are a perfect match. I\u2019m willing to withdraw and break off my engagement with you. I don\u2019t need any compensation.\u201dEmperor Jiawen finally opened his mouth. \u201cLiuyue, you are a good child. This is the Prince\u2019s fault. How about this? I will give you and your father 100,000 taels of gold. In addition, I can see that your martial arts are quite good. Why don\u2019t I find you a master from Tianlu Academy to teach you properly?\u201dMany people dreamed of the opportunity to be taught by Tian Lu Academy\u2019s teachers.Chu Liuyue muttered to herself for a moment. \u201cYour Majesty, I want to enter Tian Lu Academy for cultivation on my own.\u201dLiked it?

Tian Lu Academy recruits students annually in January, so I would like to ask Your Majesty to give me a chance.\u201dEmperor Jiawen looked at her with a complicated gaze. This Chu Liuyue is very strange. One may say that she is dumb, but she managed to solve all the problems perfectly from the beginning until now. One may say that she is smart, but she took the initiative to give up on the status of Crown Princess. She even says that she wants to enter Tian Lu Academy.It is impossible that she doesn\u2019t know that Tian Lu Academy is the top academy in the entire Country Yao Chen. One has to be the best talent to enter. She does not even have a Yuan meridian. How will she accomplish it?\u201cThis isn\u2019t hard, but\u2026 Tian Lu Academy\u2019s assessments are very difficult. Are you sure you want to go? You need to know that those old fellas won\u2019t give you an easy way out just because of me.\u201dChu Liuyue smiled lightly. \u201cI know that. I just want a chance to be assessed.\u201dEmperor Jiawen stared at her and sighed after confirming that she was not joking. \u201cSince you want it, I\u2019ll grant you your wish. However, it\u2019s all up to you if you can get in or not.\u201dChu Liuyue went on her knees and bowed. \u201cThank you, Your Majesty, for your kindness.\u201dEmperor Jiawen waved his hands. \u201cOkay. You must be tired today as well. You should return home to rest first. Chu Ning, accompany her and take care of her.\u201dChu Liuyue had no intention of staying any longer after settling the most important task, so she left with Chu Ning happily.Only when the duo\u2019s figures disappeared into the night sky outside the palace did the stiff and cold atmosphere in the palace start to warm up. However, nobody dared to say much after all that had happened that night.A happy birthday party became suppressed and boring.Rong Jin closed his eyes and rubbed his glabella. Logically speaking, he should be very relaxed after settling his marriage agreement with Chu Liuyue. However, his heart was still weighed down by a rock, making him very unhappy.He had initially planned everything well, but he did not know how it ended up like this. He did not know how the people in the Imperial City would talk about him after today.Although this wasn\u2019t a big deal, the most important thing was that his father was most likely unhappy with him.Chu Xianmin currently felt even worse than Rong Jin. She sat at her own seat with an ever-changing expression, but her entire body felt numb as her mind blanked.Chu Liuyue\u2019s words today had completely ruined her reputation. Who would care if these kinds of incidents were real or fake?She did not expect that she would get herself into trouble instead of teaching Chu Liuyue a lesson.All sorts of gazes and stares landed on her, making her very restless. She just wanted to dig a hole and hide in it.\u201cAhem\u2026\u201d Rong Xiu coughed once again.Emperor Jiawen knitted his brows. \u201cWhy is your cough getting worse?\u201dRong Xiu waved his hands. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 ahem\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his next sentence, he started coughing again, and his face became even paler.Emperor Jiawen commanded determinedly, \u201cGo back and rest now. It was so hard for you to get better at Mingyue Tianshan, but you\u2019re already in this condition after coming back for a month. What will you do in the future? If your illness relapses, I\u2019ll convict the people in your mansion.\u201dRong Xiu smiled helplessly and stood up.Yan Qing, who was behind him, immediately helped him put on a coat.\u201cI\u2019ll take my leave first.\u201d Rong Xiu then looked at Rong Jin. \u201cBrother, I\u2019ve already sent your birthday gift to your mansion. I\u2019ll make up for the lack of company today.\u201dRong Jin forced a smile. \u201cSeventh Brother, you\u2019re too kind. Your health is very important.\u201dRong Xiu then turned and left.After he left, Rong Jiu said that he had to handle military tasks and left as well.The atmosphere that was originally weird became even more awkward and cold after the two people departed.Before this, nobody thought that the prosperous Crown Prince\u2019s birthday party would end up in this manner.\u2026Rong Xiu walked through the palace doors and saw two people standing by Prince Li Mansion\u2019s horse carriage. They were Chu Liuyue and Chu Ning.He raised his brows lightly and walked over. \u201cOfficer Chu, Big Chu Missy, why are you here?\u201dChu Ning held his hands in a fist and bowed solemnly. \u201cThank you, Prince Li, for your help just now. My daughter and I will definitely remember your kindness.\u201dRong Xiu\u2019s eyes flashed slightly. \u201cOfficer Chu, you\u2019re too kind. I didn\u2019t help much today\u2026\u201dChu Ning shook his head repeatedly. \u201cApart from helping her get out of the awkward situation, you also saved her life previously. Without you, I don\u2019t know what would happen to us\u2026 In the future, do let me know if you need me to do anything for you.\u201dPreviously? Save her life? Rong Xiu looked at Chu Liuyue and met with the warning glare in her sparkling black eyes. His lips curved up slightly; the corner of his eyes also looked happy. \u201cOfficer Chu, don\u2019t mention it. It was nothing, really. I guess I\u2019m just fated with her.\u201dChu Liuyue secretly heaved a sigh of relief. Previously, she lied to Chu Ning and said that Rong Xiu had saved her. She did not know that he would take it to heart. Now that Rong Xiu was here coincidentally, Chu Ning was determined to wait around and thank him in person.She could not advise him otherwise and could only wait with him in the end.Not long later, the other fellow actually continued cooperatively, \u201cThe sky is already dark. Let me send you two home.\u201dChu Liuyue immediately rejected it once she heard him. \u201cNo need!\u201dWho knew what he was thinking in his heart?There was no free lunch in the world. The more he helped her, the more alert she was.On the surface, this man looked as gentle as jade and was a humble gentleman. However, Chu Liuyue did not think that way.Although she could not see through his eyes and guess his thoughts, her intuition told her that this was a very dangerous man. It was better to keep this type of person as far away as possible.Chu Ning looked at her in disapproval. \u201cDon\u2019t be rude to Prince Li.\u201dChu Liuyue scrunched her nose.Actually, Chu Ning also felt that this was inappropriate, but before he could speak, Rong Xiu continued, \u201cIt\u2019s on my way back anyway. I\u2019ll just bring you two along with me. Big Chu Missy must be exhausted from today\u2019s events.\u201dChu Ning\u2019s words of rejection got stuck in his throat. He was indeed worried about whether Yue\u2019er got injured during her battle with the Golden Python.After hesitating for a while, he finally spoke, \u201cThen we\u2019ll have to trouble you, Prince Li.\u201d\u201cPlease.\u201d\u2026Prince Li Mansion\u2019s horse carriage was indeed very big and comfortable. There was more than enough space for the three of them.Chu Liuyue sat beside Chu Ning and opposite Rong Xiu. Chu Liuyue was very alert at the start, but Rong Xiu closed his eyes once he boarded the carriage as if he was resting.He sat there quietly and closed his pair of deep, seductive eyes. His features\u2014which were like carvings on jade\u2014looked especially gentle under the warm light.Chu Liuyue took one look at him and immediately retrieved her gaze.They went all the way to the Chu family\u2019s estate without a word.Chu Ning got off the carriage first.Just as Chu Liuyue was about to descend, a hand pulled her back.The hand was slightly cold, but a weird sensation shot into her heart from his hand.Chu Liuyue was about to make a move, but a soft, gentle, and low voice sounded. \u201cRemember to return me the item.\u201dChu Liuyue was stunned. When she turned around, Rong Xiu had already let go of her hand and closed his eyes as if nothing had happened.She pressed her lips against each other tightly. \u201cHow petty.\u201dLiked it?

Even though his master looked gentle normally, in actual fact, he did not show his expressions on his face and would rarely laugh. What did that person do just now?Did his master really fall for that girl from the Chu family?\u201cReturn back to our mansion.\u201d Rong Xiu\u2019s voice had a tinge of rarely-seen happiness.\u201cYes!\u201d Yan Qing immediately led the way.Prince Li Mansion was not too far away from the Chu family estate. They took less than an hour to return to their residence.Rong Xiu returned to his bedroom. After a while, another one of his personal bodyguards\u2014Yu Mo\u2014came up and said respectfully, \u201cPrince, I have settled the issue.\u201dRong Xiu nodded, walked to the side of the table, and placed something down.Yu Mo took a look at it and was shocked. It was a teacup!The design of the teacup was very intricate. It was painted golden at the hems, which made it look very elegant. This was clearly something used in the palace.The next moment, Yu Mo saw the teacup shatter silently.In the blink of an eye, it turned into dust.Yu Mo\u2019s heart skipped a beat, and he did not dare ask further. He glanced at Yan Qing to ask for help. It\u2019s very rare for Master to get angry. What\u2026 happened? However, it seems like Master is not angry; it even seems like he\u2019s\u2026 in a good mood.Yan Qing lowered his head and did not say a word. What should I say? Say that it was because of that lady from the Chu family?Rong Xiu put down his coat.Yu Mo then noticed that Rong Xiu\u2019s hand had bloodstains and immediately gasped in shock. \u201cPrince, you\u2019re injured?\u201d Didn\u2019t the Prince just attend the Crown Prince\u2019s birthday party? How did he get injured?Rong Xiu lowered his head and took a look at his hand, and indeed found some bloodstains. This is\u2026 from her hand. It seems like she did not wipe the blood off cleanly.That was true. How could a small handkerchief wipe off all the blood on her face?Rong Xiu\u2019s eyes turned slightly cold. \u201cWhat has Rong Zhen been up to lately?\u201dYu Mo did not expect him to ask this so suddenly and replied after thinking for a while. \u201cFourth Princess seems to want to change her vowed fiend and likes to go to the hunting ground lately.\u201dWhat a meaningful interest.After keeping silent for some time, Rong Xiu\u2019s long fingers lightly knocked on the table twice, and he said calmly, \u201cLet her play all she wants.\u201dHis tone was calm, but Yu Mo heard the murderous intent behind it. \u201cYes!\u201d Yu Mo could not help but sigh in his heart.I heard that the Fourth Princess was very unreasonable and never cared about anyone when doing tasks. However, Master rarely cares about this type of person. She must have done something to incur Master\u2019s murderous intent.\u201cPrince, do you want to take a bath and rest?\u201dRong Xiu\u2019s fingers brushed past each other as if it had a tinge of warmth and gentleness. \u201cMm, tell the rest that I caught the flu and that I\u2019ll rest in bed. I\u2019m not going to see anyone.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Yan Qing answered and left immediately.Upon reaching the door, Rong Xiu added, \u201cIf she comes, you must tell me immediately.\u201dEven though Yan Qing was already prepared mentally, he was still taken aback and tried his best to control his expression. \u201cYes, Master.\u201dYu Mo left sensibly and quickly chased after Yan Qing. When he got out of the door, he asked, \u201cWhat exactly is going on? Who is Master referring to?\u201dYan Qing kept quiet. After being questioned for some time, he finally said, \u201cYou\u2019ll know when she comes.\u201dYu Mo was very confused. What exactly happened that night?\u2026That was not all that happened that night.That night was when even the wind tasted sweet to some people. However, it was not so nice for others.After the banquet ended, First Elder and the rest hurriedly returned to the Chu family estate.It was already very late at night, but Chu Xianmin could not return to her house and rest. Instead, she was interrogated by First Elder and the others.The doors and windows were tightly shut. First Elder sat at the main seat. Chu Yan and Lu Yao sat on the seats at the side while Chu Xianmin was standing in the middle.Everyone\u2019s gaze swept across Chu Xianmin\u2019s body like a sharp knife.\u201cWas what Chu Liuyue said today true or false?\u201d asked First Elder solemnly.Chu Xianmin was furious and humiliated. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s fake! Why would I-I do such a thing? That b*tch was smearing my name!\u201dChu Yan kept a straight face the entire way. He finally could not contain it at this point, and he slammed the table. \u201cHow dare you continue lying? If you didn\u2019t say it, how would Chu Liuyue know that the Crown Prince must light incense before he sleeps?\u201dPeople who were not close to him would definitely not know about this.Chu Xianmin was frightened until she started shivering, instantly feeling guilty. \u201cI-I\u2026 I didn\u2019t! I really didn\u2019t! I-I\u2026 just smelled the incense when I went to find the Crown Prince when he was coincidentally resting.\u201dAll the people here were experienced, and all of them could tell from her expression. Even if the two of them did not finish the final step, they must have done something they were not supposed to.Chu Yan closed his eyes. \u201cDo you know that this incident will spread throughout the Imperial City tomorrow? Your reputation will be ruined completely. Also, you actually dared to curse in front of the Emperor like a crazy woman. How would the Crown Prince still choose you as his Crown Princess?\u201dChu Xianmin immediately could not say anything else.Lu Yao suddenly spoke up at the side. \u201cSince we can\u2019t contain the incident, then we shall not.\u201dAll the others looked at her in shock.Lu Yao\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cShe can never absolve herself from this incident now, so we should just take advantage of the situation. If everyone knows that you\u2019re the Crown Prince\u2019s woman, he would definitely not leave you in the lurch.\u201dChu Xianmin felt a little wronged. \u201cB-but if we do so, I\u2019ll probably lose the proper status of his wife\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen you enter the Crown Prince Mansion, that proper status will be yours sooner or later. What else is important?\u201d Lu Yao was nonchalant. \u201cYour only chance is to become as strong as possible. As long as you are capable enough, you can make everyone else shut up. The academy\u2019s assessment is coming up. You must rank first, do you understand?\u201dChu Xianmin bit her lips. This was the only way now. \u201cYes, I understand.\u201d\u2026Chu Liuyue only felt comfortable after she returned home, took a hot bath, and changed into a set of clean clothes.When she was arranging her clothes, that handkerchief suddenly dropped down.She picked it up.The original snow-white, pure handkerchief was already stained all over with blood. She could not bear to look at it.Remembering Rong Xiu\u2019s words, she grunted lightly and used water to wash the handkerchief.I\u2019ll return it to him tomorrow; we\u2019ll owe each other nothing.Liked it?

Everyone partook in heated discussions.Too many things had happened that night, but the person who attracted the most attention was Chu Xianmin. She actually had an affair with the Crown Prince much earlier.At first, they thought that she was a pure, innocent, and talented young girl, but they did not expect her to be so immoral in secret. Even though Mainland Xuan Wu focused on one\u2019s capabilities, they were still quite conservative about such things.Chu Xianmin was currently still a maiden and had not even reached marriageable age, but her reputation was completely ruined after this incident was exposed.Everyone already expected Rong Jin to break off the marriage agreement with Chu Liuyue, so in comparison, the crowd was still more interested in Chu Xianmin\u2019s affairs. Of course, everyone was also shocked about Chu Liuyue wanting to enter Tian Lu Academy. However, nobody cared about it after the momentary shock.How could an invalid with a lacking Yuan meridian get into Tian Lu Academy?The crowd only thought she was delusional; some even felt that she was strongly affected when her marriage agreement was broken off, making her brain become abnormal.Most people were still thinking about the Crown Prince, Rong Jin.The Crown Princess spot was still empty, and the most worthy competitor, Chu Xianmin, was humiliated when the incident was exposed, so she would definitely not be able to have the proper status. Hence, quite a few girls from distinguished families started to get their hopes high.\u2026Chu Liuyue woke up early in the morning and practiced in the yard as per usual. She only stopped when she exhausted her energy.By this time, the sky was only slightly bright.\u201cYue\u2019er.\u201d Chu Ning\u2019s voice sounded from behind.Chu Liuyue turned around and saw Chu Ning standing in the yard and looking at her dotingly. She had already felt Chu Ning\u2019s presence previously, so she was not shocked.Chu Ning was long used to her crazily practicing every day, but he did not stop her. He knew that this was something she wanted to do, so he chose to support her silently.\u201cFather, aren\u2019t you going to the store today?\u201d asked Chu Liuyue strangely. Her gaze quickly sized Chu Ning up; she realized that he felt different from the past.He had changed into a navy robe with a white belt around his waist. His hair was tied up nicely, and he had just shaved his beard, leaving some light stubble on his chin. Chu Ning had clearly meticulously dressed up today, looking much younger than before.The most important thing was that he no longer had a defeated gaze like before. Instead, it was bright and clear. His entire person looked energized as if he had turned over a new leaf.Chu Liuyue actually had already guessed this would happen.\u201cI have something important to do today.\u201d Chu Ning\u2019s eyes seemed calm, but one could still see them sparkling emotionally.Chu Liuyue nodded. It seemed like Chu Ning had finally picked himself up.\u201cIn the future, I will definitely not let Yue\u2019er suffer grievances like previously. It\u2019s time to calculate some debts properly,\u201d said Chu Ning determinedly.In the past, his body was unwell, so he could not protect Yue\u2019er. Now that he had successfully overcome his injuries, he could not sit around anymore.He lowered his voice and said solemnly, \u201cYue\u2019er, you said that one of the people Chu Xianmin sent to kill you was called Song Lian?\u201d\u201cYes. Father, do you know him?\u201d Chu Liuyue\u2019s interest was piqued.Chu Ning squinted his eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t know him at first, but I found out some things after asking around lately. That Song Lian was quite a famous thug. He\u2019s usually very arrogant and pompous, causing trouble everywhere he went. He\u2019s messed up quite a number of people in the Imperial City. He slacked around all day and had nothing serious to do, so he frequented all the major gambling dens. However, such a person has quite the background. Although he caused some serious trouble before and even offended some aristocratic children, nothing happened to him in the end.\u201dChu Liuyue nodded in understanding. \u201cIt seems like the person behind him is not Chu Xianmin, but someone else.\u201dChu Xianmin does not have such abilities. There must be someone else behind the scenes. It\u2019s no wonder that a mere stage-three warrior could be so arrogant. He clearly had someone backing him.\u201cFather, can you find out who his backer is?\u201dChu Ning paused for a while and shook his head in regret. \u201cNot yet. He seemed to be very cautious about this and hid it very well. I need more time to look into it.\u201dChu Liuyue nodded. Two may keep counsel putting one away. Now that he has disappeared for a month, the person behind him will not take his lying. He will be exposed sooner or later.After thinking for a while, she asked, \u201cFather, do you know which gambling den he likes to frequent?\u201dChu Ning asked weirdly, \u201cFeng Yun Gambling Den, but why are you asking about this? Yue\u2019er, you can\u2019t take the risk yourself\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Father. I\u2019m just asking casually. I won\u2019t do anything about it.\u201dChu Ning then calmed down, and said after some thinking, \u201cOh, right. Prince Li has helped us quite a few times, but we haven\u2019t thanked him properly yet\u2026\u201dChu Liuyue was speechless upon seeing the grateful look her father had toward Rong Xiu. If this carried on, she did not know what else her father would do.She hurriedly said, \u201cFather, you\u2019re right. I plan to look for him and thank him personally today.\u201dThe best solution was to return him his belongings and see less of him in the future.Chu Ning knitted his brows. \u201cToday? But we don\u2019t have any presentable gifts\u2026\u201d\u201cPrince Li is so kind, why would he care about this? Don\u2019t you think so, Father?\u201d Chu Liuyue smiled and squinted her eyes. \u201cWe might not have gifts, but we have sincere hearts. Prince Li will definitely not care about this. What do you think?\u201dChu Ning then relaxed. \u201cThat\u2019s true. Okay, then.\u201dChu Liuyue blinked solemnly. \u201cI\u2019ll head over right now!\u201d\u2026Chu Liuyue left the Chu family estate smoothly. Although her marriage agreement with the Crown Prince was broken off, the entire Chu family now knew that Chu Liuyue was not one to mess with after all these incidents, so they were much more polite toward her.Nobody even asked her what she was going out for and just let her leave.Chu Liuyue walked towards Prince Li Mansion happily.She did not hide her identity today. Quite a few people recognized her innocent and pretty face on the way. They all pointed and talked about her in secret, but they did not dare to bully her like in the past.Chu Liuyue did not care and pretended not to notice it.After walking for a quarter of an hour, she reached the crowded streets; the number of people around her started to increase.She walked on, and there was a sudden noise coming from the front. A figure then rushed towards her rapidly.Just as she was about to move away, she suddenly noticed something and squinted her eyes slightly as she paused.The other party bumped right into her.\u201cCatch that thief!\u201d hollered someone from the back.Chu Liuyue turned around to take a look, and the person that bumped into her disappeared into thin air.Her lips curved up unnoticeably, and she immediately followed him.\u2026The sun was setting.The last bit of sunshine poured in through the windows and shone on a person\u2019s tall figure.Rong Xiu read the book in his hands silently and gentlemanly, but his eyes were slightly cold for some reason.Yan Qing said, \u201cPrince, I\u2019ve received 23 letters today, including the ones from Crown Prince Mansion. I have already rejected all of them.\u201dRong Xiu replied with an \u201cMm.\u201dThe atmosphere became even stiffer.The sky gradually darkened.Rong Xiu flipped a page and asked nonchalantly, \u201cNo one came to visit us today?\u201dYan Qing obviously knew who he was asking about. He could not help but feel bitter in his heart as he lowered his head. \u201cNo one, Prince.\u201dPiak!The book was slammed on the table.Liked it?

He hurriedly ripped open the pouch and found out that there was nothing inside except for a white handkerchief. Frustration flashed across his face, but it quickly disappeared as he smiled at Chu Liuyue cunningly.\u201cDo you really think that I\u2019m targeting your money?\u201d As he said that, he took out a dagger from his waist.His murderous intentions were obvious. However, Chu Liuyue was not anxious at all. Instead, her face broke out into a meaningful smile.The man was taken aback and immediately reacted after that. That pouch did not even have money in it. Even though it was stolen, Chu Liuyue shouldn\u2019t have cared about it, but she still followed me. That means\u2026 she came here on purpose!\u201cYou must be delusional to think that you can steal something from me with your middling skills. But since you wanted me here, I\u2019ll accede to your request.\u201d Chu Liuyue\u2019s words made the man\u2019s face contort.\u201cYou must be tired of living!\u201d As the man hollered, the dagger in his hands rapidly went towards Chu Liuyue.Stage-four warrior! The moment he struck, Chu Liuyue swiftly inferred his capabilities. She squinted her eyes. It seems like the missing Song Lian\u2019s trio made the person backing them fear me. This time, they directly sent a stage-four warrior to kill me.Chu Liuyue stood with her legs apart and rapidly moved back half a step. Her right leg bent slightly as she went on her tip-toes and suddenly exerted her strength.Her seemingly gentle and thin body was actually filled with shocking tenacity and explosive power as she unleashed it within a moment.She actually chose to go against a stage-four warrior head-on.Chu Liuyue kicked the man\u2019s wrist with one foot.The man\u2019s hands turned quickly, and he immediately used the dagger to stab Chu Liuyue\u2019s foot.Tsing!A crisp sound was made.That man only felt a strong impact from Chu Liuyue\u2019s feet, making his entire body turn numb.His dagger directly slipped out of his hands and left shocking traces.What\u2019s going on? The man was stunned; he immediately looked up to see cold, sharp, and vague glimmers coming from the bottom of Chu Liuyue\u2019s shoes.That was\u2026 a cast iron blade!Before he could carefully think about why Chu Liuyue had such a weapon on her, he suddenly felt excruciating pain.Chuo! Chuo!The sharp weapon cut across his wrist and sliced off a piece of his flesh in no time.\u201cAh!\u201d He yelled out in pain and quickly moved backward. He looked down to see his entire arm already bloody.Chu Liuyue landed on the ground and shook her head with some sort of dissatisfaction upon seeing the scenario. \u201cIt\u2019s still not sharp enough\u2026\u201dShe long knew that danger loomed all around her, so she was very careful about her words and actions. As her strength had not recovered yet, she used other aspects to increase her combat skills.She specifically asked Chu Ning for the blades hidden in her shoes.If her attack was successful, the man\u2019s entire wrist would\u2019ve been cut off directly.It was a pity that the cast iron blade was not of good quality, so she could only make do with it.Seeing her calm expression, the injured man was frustrated and furious. He was a stage-four warrior no matter what, yet he was defeated by an invalid. His superiors had instructed him to find a way to catch Chu Liuyue; he could not fail at his task no matter what.Thinking of this, his eyes flashed as he sneered. \u201cSo the rumored weak and useless Big Chu Missy is actually this harsh\u2026 It\u2019s a pity that you\u2019re still nothing in terms of real capabilities, no matter what kind of tricks you have up your sleeves.\u201dHe bellowed and threw his dagger aside. He then crossed his arms and started circulating his internal force.A green wind blade rapidly formed around his body. An enormous, forceful suppression exuded from his body.This suppression made the already narrow alley seem even smaller.\u201cBreeze Chop!\u201d The man\u2019s voice boomed, and the green wind blade chopped down towards Chu Liuyue at the speed of lightning.Huala!A clear, white crack appeared on the bluestone as the wind blade headed straight for Chu Liuyue.Chu Liuyue flew up, and the howling winds deafened her ears.The strong suppression she felt made her head whir; her moves were much slower than before.The fourth stage was the watershed for warriors. Even though warriors of the first three stages could absorb Heaven and Earth Force, it was just to strengthen their bodies and energy.Only stage-four warriors and stronger could circulate the accumulated force within their bodies and execute an explosive attack.A stage-three warrior could not even be compared to a stage-four warrior in terms of attack strength or attack speed.This Breeze Chop instantly forced Chu Liuyue into a corner.Chu Liuyue even felt her glabella hurting slightly.Her eyes stared at the green wind blade closely; her muscles tightened as she held her breath and waited.Her strong eyesight and rich fighting experience were the only reasons why she could win against Song Lian and the rest with her identity as an invalid. With these two things, one could make up for the difference between an average person and a stage-three warrior. However, stage-four warriors were different.The other party could imbue his force into an attack. Thus, it was very difficult for her to win. Even though her Yuan meridian had already recovered, she had not gathered much force. She could not even compete with the other party in this aspect.She could only look for the man\u2019s shortcomings.Shua!The green wind blade flew up quickly.Chu Liuyue\u2019s waist bent backward, and her body was almost parallel to the floor.The next moment, she used one hand to push against the ground with her strength to flip around, barely avoiding the attack.Kacha!The green wind blade struck the ground behind her and caused a crack to appear.\u201cYou really know how to dodge!\u201d The man was very surprised to see this, and the murderous intent in his eyes grew. \u201cNo wonder Song Lian and the rest fell in your hands.\u201dSomething flashed across Chu Liuyue\u2019s eyes secretively. As expected! I haven\u2019t even found them, but the other party has sent themselves to my door.Her gaze quickly swept past the man. \u201cIt seems like your master is Song Lian\u2019s true backer.\u201dThe man was stunned for a while. He then started laughing loudly as if he heard a joke. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty smart! What a pity, the smarter you are, the more you have to die!\u201dChu Liuyue wanted to find out more, but she suddenly felt a cold impact at the back of her head.She flew forward without thinking.Peng!A deep trench appeared at the place where she was standing initially.The remains of the strong attack caused blood to rise through her chest.She immediately raised her head to look and saw the man who yelled \u2018catch the thief\u2019 blocking the alley\u2019s entrance.The key was that he was also a stage-four warrior.\u201cDie!\u201d The duo\u2019s eyes met, and they rushed to attack Chu Liuyue at the same time.The cold and harsh murderous aura immediately buried her.Liked it?

She definitely was not a match for two stage-four warriors attacking her together. However, this did not mean that she did not have other ways of defeating them.At this point, a white figure suddenly dashed in from the side.Roar!A strong power instantly erupted alongside the oppressive roar.Hong! Hong! Hong!Before the two men\u2019s attacks could reach Chu Liuyue, they suddenly died off. The remnants of the strong waves even impacted the two men instead.Sou! Sou!The duo could not even dodge in time and felt an enormous force blowing them away before they could even see who it was. They landed on the floor harshly and spat blood out as their chests shivered.Their originally arrogant auras immediately mellowed down.\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d The duo hurriedly lifted their heads in anger and fear. However, they were taken aback by what they saw.The one that suddenly attacked them was a white lion with a strong build. Its body was covered in snow-white fur, and its blue eyes gleamed with an icy-cold brilliance as its entire body exuded an oppressive aura.Previously, it had just casually waved its claws and easily defeated two stage-four warriors\u2019 attacks.\u201cSeventh-grade Heavenly Lion!\u201d The duo could not help but gasp in surprise when they realized who had attacked them; anxiety filled their faces.Why would a high-level fiend that only seemed to exist in rumors appear here? There were only a few seventh-grade fiends in the entire Country Yao Chen, and Heavenly Lions were even rarer and never before seen. However, one actually appeared in the Imperial City.Chu Liuyue was also shocked. \u201cXue Xue? Why are you here?\u201d How did it appear so timely? Was it following me the whole time? However, I did not notice it at all before\u2026 It seems like I have to increase my cultivation training.The duo\u2019s eyes twitched upon hearing Chu Liuyue\u2019s words. This familiar tone\u2026 meant that Chu Liuyue knew this seventh-grade Heavenly Lion earlier on.It clearly came to help her! The duo was pretty strong when they worked together, so they would still be able to fight if it were others helping her. However, the one that stood in front of them was a true seventh-grade Heavenly Lion.It only had to raise its paws to claim their lives easily.What was with Chu Liuyue? How did she have such a strong backing behind her?Xue Xue, who was originally filled with murderous intent, reduced its aggressive aura and lowered its head to rub against Chu Liuyue\u2019s waist after hearing her words. It let out deep purrs as if it was whining.Chu Liuyue patted its soft fur and secretly heaved a sigh of relief in her heart. These two people will not be a problem with Xue Xue around. Just that\u2026 its appearance is too much of a coincidence.\u201cHe sent you here?\u201d asked Chu Liuyue as her eyes turned.Xue Xue immediately shook its head, but it nodded in conflict after remembering something. Even though it really wanted to claim all the credit, if its master found out about its independent claim, it would suffer a beating again\u2026Xue Xue had a strong urge to live.Chu Liuyue chuckled. She could sort of guess Xue Xue\u2019s thoughts by looking at her hesitant expression.It seemed like both the master and the servant had a part to play in this.What exactly is that Rong Xiu thinking? This question flashed across Chu Liuyue\u2019s brain very quickly, but she did not show it on her face as she looked at the duo instead. She had to settle this urgent problem first.The duo\u2019s eyes met with each other; they both saw the anxiety in each other\u2019s eyes.Chu Liuyue was no longer someone they could defeat with the seventh-grade Heavenly Lion helping her.\u201cRun!\u201d Without hesitation, the duo stood up and fled in opposite directions.Chu Liuyue\u2019s lips curved up slightly.Xue Xue bellowed and suddenly disappeared.The next moment, it appeared in front of one of the men. It swiftly raised its claws and harshly slammed them against the man\u2019s chest.Huala!The man\u2019s clothes were instantly ripped apart, and blood spurted out in all directions.Bang!The gigantic force caused the man to land strongly on the floor; there was a long streak of blood, which only stopped when he hit against the wall.The other man also had a similar ending. He did not even run out of the alley before Xue Xue directly attacked him and smashed him beside the previous man.A seventh-grade Heavenly Lion was indeed very powerful. These two stage-four warriors did not even have the chance to struggle or escape and had lost miserably in Xue Xue\u2019s hands.The tables were turned in no time.Chu Liuyue walked to the duo and looked at them from high ground. \u201cSay it. Who is your master?\u201dThe duo was on the verge of dying but still refused to say a word.Chu Liuyue crossed her arms and smiled lightly. \u201cYou refuse to say? Then let me guess\u2026 is your master the Crown Prince?\u201dThe two men were shocked and looked at her subconsciously, but they immediately noticed something the next moment and nervously shifted their gazes. However, this reaction was already sufficient.\u201cSong Lian\u2019s real backer is Song Yuan, right?\u201d\u201cW-what are you talking about? I don\u2019t understand you!\u201d The two people were not dumb and persisted with their denials.Chu Liuyue did not care at all. Actually, this incident was quite easy to guess. After all, only a few people hated her and wanted her to die in the wild.There were even fewer people who could send stage-four warriors to go against her.In Rong Jin\u2019s eyes, killing her ten times was not even enough to vent his anger from the new and old hatred.It was a pity that this person was not very smart.In the beginning, he sent out Song Lian. He didn\u2019t learn to be smarter after Song Lian died. Instead, he hastily sent two other people to kill her.\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t admit it.\u201d Chu Liuyue did not even care about the duo; she turned to face Xue Xue. \u201cXue Xue, can I trouble you to do something for me? Drag these two people away.\u201dXue Xue looked at her in confusion.Why did she not want to end the people that wanted to kill her directly?Chu Liuyue suddenly turned around and picked up the pouch one of the men had previously thrown on the floor. She lifted her eyebrows. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\u2026The silence in the room was almost suffocating.Yan Qing lowered his head and felt that the cold atmosphere around his master could literally freeze a person.Master never really liked to show his emotions or feelings on the outside, but he actually behaved in this manner just because that person did not come on time\u2026\u201cMaster, Big Chu Missy is here!\u201d Yu Mo\u2019s voice suddenly sounded from the outside at this point.Almost instantly, Yan Qing felt that his master\u2019s exuding aura had changed strangely. He quickly raised his head and saw that his master was already looking at the door. Looking out from the half-open door, he could vaguely see the blurred, thin figure hiding behind Yu Mo in the dark sky outside.\u201cMaster, I\u2019ll invite Big Chu Missy in right away,\u201d said Yan Qing happily as if a huge burden was lifted off his shoulders.Rong Xiu\u2019s eyes sparkled like a starry night, but his eyebrows knitted slightly in the next moment. As he tidied his clothes and picked up the book again, he said lightly, \u201cIt\u2019s late at night, and I\u2019m not feeling too well. I won\u2019t be seeing anyone today.\u201dLiked it?

She stopped in her tracks and raised her eyebrows slightly.Yu Mo was also dazed when he heard this. Won\u2019t be seeing? However, Master clearly said before that he would not see anyone, but that we had to report to him immediately if Big Chu Missy came. That\u2019s the reason why I dared to bring her in directly.Why did Master say he did not want to see her? He looked at Yan Qing and asked him what was going on with his expression.Yan Qing was also puzzled. How would I know? He personally witnessed his master waiting for Big Chu Missy for the entire day. It was clearly impossible that he did not want to see her. Didn\u2019t he just get angry because Big Chu Missy did not come? She finally came, but his master did not seem to cheer up and even refused to see her.\u201cMaster, this\u2026 Big Chu Missy\u2026\u201dRong Xiu raised his head and looked at Yan Qing silently.Yan Qing immediately swallowed his words and lowered his head obediently as he stood aside.Rong Xiu retracted his gaze and flipped another page.As the wind blew, one of his hands formed a fist and covered his mouth as he coughed a few times. However, that pair of eyes did not look at Chu Liuyue from the start till the end.Chu Liuyue did not drag her feet and looked at Yu Mo. \u201cSince your master is unwell, I won\u2019t disturb him any longer. Please help me to return him this item, and thank your master for helping me,\u201d said Chu Liuyue as she handed over the handkerchief in her pouch.Yu Mo looked at the handkerchief, and his eyeballs almost popped out. Is this not Master\u2019s personal handkerchief? Master is normally very concerned about this handkerchief and always has it with him, but\u2026 why did it end up with Chu Liuyue?Yu Mo did not enter the palace that day and naturally did not know what had happened.Master actually gave this to Chu Liuyue\u2026\u201cBig Chu Missy, this\u2026\u201d Yu Mo hesitated to pick up the handkerchief, but he suddenly felt a chill running down his spine. He shivered and immediately rejected her solemnly. \u201cBig Chu Missy, this belongs to Master. You should return it to him yourself.\u201dChu Liuyue was speechless. Isn\u2019t it just a handkerchief? Why is he so serious about it?She wanted to return it too! If not, she wouldn\u2019t visit him at his place. However, Rong Xiu was the one who claimed that he did not want to see anyone. What could she do?She looked inside again. She could see the bulky figure through the half-open door.The warm light showed off his unique side view, which was flawless with its intricate details. His eyes were slightly lowered, and his thin lips were pressed against each other tightly.Rong Xiu\u2026 seems to be angry? What is he angry about? Chu Liuyue had no idea what he was thinking and decided not to care about it after pondering for a while. She directly looked at Rong Xiu and said, \u201cI\u2019ve returned you your item. Prince Li, I don\u2019t owe you anything else, right? Thank you for saving me the previous few times, but I don\u2019t like to owe other people favors. We\u2019re vastly different people. To avoid any future troubles, let\u2019s not see each other anymore.\u201dAfter she finished her sentence, she did not see Rong Xiu\u2019s reaction and shoved the handkerchief at Yu Mo.Rong Xiu laughed silently. He really could not do anything about her. He finally raised his head, and his eyes landed on Chu Liuyue, surrounding her invisibly. \u201cNo, you still owe me two favors.\u201dChu Liuyue\u2019s heart jumped.\u201cFirstly, Xue Xue saved you.\u201d His tone was gentle and calm as usual, but even colder than the moonlight. \u201cSecondly, the Crown Prince did not send those people to kill you today.\u201dChu Liuyue\u2019s eyes turned slightly cold.\u2026The Imperial City seemed peaceful that day, but it was secretly filled with uproars.In the study of Crown Prince Mansion\u2026Inside the room, there was only Rong Jin and an elder in a gray robe.\u201cAre you really sure that there\u2019s a seventh-grade fiend in the Imperial City? But I didn\u2019t hear any news about it\u2026\u201d asked Rong Jin suspiciously.\u201cThat seventh-grade fiend only appeared for a while, and an average person can\u2019t even detect it. However, I have already gone to check, and there were indeed battle marks left behind by a seventh-grade fiend in Eight Corner Alley of the Imperial City\u2019s northeast region. The elder stroked his beard confidently. \u201cAlso, I can confirm that it\u2019s not an existing fiend in the Imperial City, and it had just appeared here. Besides, I\u2019m pretty sure that it has an owner.\u201dRong Jin knitted his brows tightly. \u201cHowever, there are very few people who can conquer a seventh-grade fiend in the Imperial City\u2026 Who would it be?\u201dThe elder shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate anyone in the Imperial City. If the other party can have a seventh-grade fiend, he definitely won\u2019t be easy to deal with. If he\u2019s coming for you, you must be extra careful.\u201dThe elder shook his head. \u201cEven though you\u2019re already the Crown Prince, quite a few people are still eyeing your status. Your marriage agreement with Chu Liuyue ended very badly, and the Emperor is very unhappy with you. You can\u2019t cause any more trouble at this point.\u201dRong Jin was furious when he was reminded of this. \u201cIt\u2019s all because of Chu Liuyue that\u2026\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s just an invalid and nothing to be worried about. You should lie low for this period of time and wait until the rumors die down. The most important thing now is to elevate your skills and allow the Emperor to see your abilities.\u201dRong Jin took a deep breath and nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll definitely remember your teachings.\u201d\u201cThis is your last year at Tian Lu Academy. You must grab this chance, do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u2026The news about the seventh-grade fiend spread quietly; it quickly reached the ears of distinguished families.Rong Zhen also found out about it. She was very excited. The previous few fiends did not have high grades. Now that there was a rare seventh-grade fiend, she had to go and take a look. It would be amazing if she could capture it and make a vow with it. Hence, she also started sending people out to investigate the whereabouts of this seventh-grade fiend.On the other hand, the assassination attempt on Chu Liuyue was as if it never happened. Even the disappearance of the duo did not attract any attention.In this seemingly calm situation, Chu Liuyue finally received Tian Lu Academy\u2019s notification.Tian Lu Academy accepted the Emperor\u2019s request and gave Chu Liuyue a special chance to enter the academy.As long as she passed the assessment, she could enter Tian Lu Academy and become a part of them.\u2026Chu Liuyue\u2019s 14th birthday was on the 10th of August. It was also the day of her Tian Lu Academy assessment.Chu Ning had already prepared longevity noodles for her to eat.In her previous life, her every birthday was spent extravagantly. Numerous people came forward to wish her well, and the list of presents was endless. Now, even though there was only Chu Ning to accompany her, this bowl of longevity noodles made her feel even warmer and more secure.Chu Liuyue finished the noodles cleanly and briefly packed her items before heading towards Tian Lu Academy.Chu Ning wanted to follow her, but she rejected him. She knew that Chu Ning was busy lately, and in her eyes, it was very easy to enter the academy, so she did not require anyone to accompany her. However, when Chu Liuyue arrived at Tian Lu Academy\u2019s entrance, she realized that there were many people waiting outside.Chu Liuyue\u2019s appearance garnered countless stares.Chu Liuyue instantly understood that these people clearly came here to watch a show.A middle-aged man stood in front of Tian Lu Academy\u2019s entrance and had a stern face. He looked at Chu Liuyue, and his eyes vaguely filled with frustration.\u201cChu Liuyue, right? Since the Emperor spoke in favor of you, Tian Lu Academy will give you a chance. There are three categories for the entrance assessment: warrior, Xuan Master, and heavenly doctor. You\u2019ll succeed if you pass any one of them. Which would you like to choose?\u201dLiked it?

    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37: AssessmentPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosChu Liuyue quickly surveyed her surroundings, and her lips curved up into an interesting smile.Tian Lu Academy was the top academy in the entire Country Yao Chen and held a very high status. Even in the Imperial City, where every inch of ground was worth a huge amount of money, Tian Lu Academy still occupied a very large area.The lapis lazuli structure made the entrance seem traditional yet magnanimous. In front of the entrance was a black crystal stone in the shape of a longsword that descended from the heavens and stabbed right into the ground. \u2018Tian Lu Academy\u2019 was carved in gold on it.These were already worth an extravagant amount, let alone the things inside the academy.Before the entrance was a wide court made up of white jade. This was also Tian Lu Academy\u2019s territory; it was the venue they used when they recruited students annually. However, there was nothing on the court when Chu Liuyue came to participate in the assessment.There was only a small square table in front of that middle-aged man.There were three black, wooden boxes on the table, which clearly represented the so-called three different assessments. It seemed like they did not even intend to give Chu Liuyue a proper chance of assessment on the court.Chu Liuyue bowed and asked gently, \u201cThank you, Senior. Sorry if I\u2019m rude, but may I know your name?\u201dThe middle-aged man was originally upset with Chu Liuyue since he felt that she was delusional for wanting to enter Tian Lu Academy as an invalid. However, they could not reject the Emperor, though they knew that their efforts would be wasted.He originally had something urgent to do today, but he was sent over to assess Chu Liuyue at the very last minute. He was extremely upset and, of course, would not give Chu Liuyue an easy time. Thus, he also haphazardly prepared the things needed for her assessment.He sneered in his heart upon hearing Chu Liuyue\u2019s tone. There was no use for anything else if she did not have any abilities. She did not even need to try to lick his boots.\u201cBai Chen!\u201dChu Liuyue laughed and pointed at the court not far away. \u201cSenior, I\u2019ve heard that Tian Lu Academy assessments are usually held on that court, but it seems like it\u2019s not open today\u2026 May I know if you will be able to do me a favor?\u201dBai Chen looked at her mockingly as if he had heard a joke. \u201cYou should know that the other participants have their assessments on that court because they have all sorts of fights and battles there. The forces generated would then be neutralized by the array formation on that court. As for you\u2026 do you even have a use for it?\u201dThe crowd heard this and burst out laughing.\u201cExactly! Does she need it? Haha!\u201d\u201cTian Lu Academy only accepts the top few talents. How dare a person like her without a Yuan meridian dare to dream of entering? She\u2019s just going to humiliate herself.\u201d\u201cDid you see how the rest don\u2019t even want to care about her? They only gave her a chance because of the Emperor\u2026 There will only be an extra laughing stock in the Imperial City from now on\u2026\u201dChu Liuyue seemed to have not heard the mockery, and her expression did not change. She looked at Bai Chen and asked persistently, \u201cThen\u2026 what must I do to make you open the court?\u201dBai Chen sized her up and did not notice any force moving within her. He could not help but sigh. \u201cAs long as you can open any one of these three black, wooden boxes.\u201dThe black, wooden boxes were made using great amounts of a special black spiritual wood. The boxes had different seals according to the various assessments. It was impossible for an average person to open them.If a student wanted to obtain the assessment questions, they had to open the black, wooden box personally. This was precisely the assessment\u2019s first stage.Chu Liuyue nodded and did not say anything else. She moved forward and directly went for the box on the left.The crowd\u2019s faces were filled with excitement for the show.The thin, white hand landed on the black, wooden box.Bai Chen frowned slightly. You don\u2019t even know where you stand.Kacha!A small, crisp sound was made.Chu Liuyue easily opened the box.The atmosphere turned stiff in no time.Bai Chen\u2019s expression froze. How is that possible?Chu Liuyue had already picked up the piece of paper in the box. \u201cYou pass if you become a stage-three warrior.\u201dThe stage-three warrior requirement seemed simple, but the students that Tian Lu Academy accepted were all under 20 years of age. They would unquestionably be talents if they could reach the standards of a stage-three warrior.Bai Chen did not even have time to think about how Chu Liuyue opened the box. He saw the topic she chose and burst out laughing. \u201cWarrior Assessment!\u201d He looked down at Chu Liuyue from above. \u201cYou pass if you reach the standards of a stage-three warrior. However\u2026 I remember that your Yuan meridian is lacking, and you\u2019re not even a warrior, right?\u201dThe crowd immediately chuckled, not even bothering to hide their laughter.The others might have a chance of achieving this condition, but as for Chu Liuyue, she would not reach it in her entire life.Some people even hissed.\u201cGet lost! Stop humiliating yourself!\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201dBai Chen shook his head and was about to pack his things.\u201cWait a minute,\u201d said Chu Liuyue suddenly. \u201cSenior Bai Chen, if my capabilities reach the standards of a stage-three warrior, do I pass?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Bai Chen suspected that he had heard her wrongly.Chu Liuyue asked again, \u201cIf I can win against a stage-three warrior, will you say that I\u2019ve met the condition?\u201dBai Chen hesitated for a while and nodded later. \u201cOf course! But\u2026 can you do it?\u201dChu Liuyue\u2019s lips curved up slightly. \u201cI want to try.\u201dBai Chen understood and waved his long sleeves. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll lower my abilities to a stage-three warrior. If you can last three moves from me, you win.\u201d After he finished talking, he waved his long sleeves, and the court buzzed softly.After this, he suddenly raised his power and jumped up like an eagle that soared in the skies. He instantly flew more than ten feet away and landed in the center of the court accurately and silently.Chu Liuyue walked over step by step and stood in front of Bai Chen. \u201cSenior, please enlighten me.\u201dBai Chen did not care about her. Without talking, his palm turned into a fist and went straight for Chu Liuyue.Hu!He moved at lightning speed and appeared in front of Chu Liuyue in the blink of an eye. His strong punch cut across the air, and he utilized his immense strength.In the blink of an eye, his fist was only less than an arm away from Chu Liuyue. He did not need to use martial arts skills when he lowered his abilities to a stage-three warrior; he could just use his physical strength to go against Chu Liuyue.This one punch would end everything.Chu Liuyue saw the rapidly approaching fist from the corner of her eye. She stood there with her back straight and seemed frightened to death by the outsiders.Bai Chen thought the same way. However, when he thought that his punch would definitely land on her, the young girl in front of him suddenly disappeared.Chu Liuyue\u2019s body moved in some way, and she had actually avoided the punch miraculously.Bai Chen was instantly stunned by what he saw. A chill ran down his spine the next moment.A cold, murderous intent wrapped him completely.He!He subconsciously circulated his force and executed an attack.\u201cLightning Shock!\u201dHong! Long! Long!A blue fireball suddenly exploded. However, there was no one there.Bai Chen was shocked before looking beside him in realization. As expected, an unharmed Chu Liuyue was standing right there.Chu Liuyue looked at him with a beaming smile. \u201cSenior Bai Chen, it seems like you\u2019ve used more than a stage-three warrior\u2019s ability, right?\u201dBai Chen\u2019s heart dropped. I fell for her trap!Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38: Pass!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosThe spectators outside the court looked at each other in silence and only comprehended what had happened after a while\u2014when Bai Chen was testing Chu Liuyue, he had actually used skills above the standards of a stage-three warrior.This also meant that he did not even lower his abilities to a stage-three warrior, just like what Chu Liuyue had said. Then\u2026 what exactly did this mean?Bai Chen\u2019s face flushed, and he felt embarrassed. He initially thought that this move could destroy Chu Liuyue, but he didn\u2019t expect that he was unable to control it properly and had spoiled the assessment.It was humiliating to commit such a low-level mistake in front of so many people.However\u2026 What exactly happened just now? Bai Chen\u2019s eyebrows knitted tightly as he stared straight at Chu Liuyue. He was a stage-five warrior and was considered strong in Country Yao Chen. He had assessed a few students in the past, but he had never made such a mistake.He clearly remembered that he felt a scary murderous intent from Chu Liuyue earlier, so he subconsciously used his real abilities. However, how could an invalid like Chu Liuyue make him feel such intense suppression and oppression?Bai Chen did not understand it, no matter how much he thought about it. He looked at Chu Liuyue with suspicious eyes as if he wanted to burn a hole in her.\u201cSenior Bai Chen, you previously said that I\u2019d pass if I can last three moves from you. However, you exceeded a stage-three warrior\u2019s ability in the first move\u2026 What should we do about this?\u201d asked Chu Liuyue calmly as if the incident that just happened had no impact on her.This question made Bai Chen\u2019s face contort even more. Even though he was upset, he had to admit that the exchange just now could prove Chu Liuyue\u2019s abilities to some extent since she could force him to use his true strength.This young girl must be hiding something up her sleeves.The spectators outside fell into dead silence.After a while, Bai Chen\u2019s voice boomed. \u201cIf you can endure my next move head-on, I\u2019ll immediately let you pass.\u201d After he finished his sentence, he moved his feet quickly and dashed towards Chu Liuyue.Chu Liuyue\u2019s lips curved up unnoticeably.An average person would know that it was slightly overboard for Bai Chen to ask her to face his move head-on and endure it.Even if he had lowered his ability to a stage-three warrior\u2019s standards, he was originally a stage-five warrior, so the abilities he executed would definitely be stronger than that of a stage-three warrior.Even a true stage-three warrior might not be able to go against him head-on.Chu Liuyue raised her eyes and saw that Bai Chen was already near her.The merciless punch went straight for her face. This punch had even more force than the first time he attacked.\u201cIt\u2019s over. Chu Liuyue didn\u2019t even give Bai Chen any face. She\u2019s definitely going to be taught a lesson.\u201d\u201cThis punch will probably cause Chu Liuyue\u2019s bones to break.\u201d\u201cPfft, so what? Chu Liuyue was asking for it. She should just obediently hide in a corner as an invalid and stop hallucinating\u2026\u201dThe spectators discussed silently as if they had already foreseen Chu Liuyue\u2019s miserable defeat.Under countless eyes, the thin, young girl in the middle of the court suddenly understood what to do. She did not make any extra movements. Instead, she spread her legs and lunged forward as her right hand turned into a fist.The crowd gasped loudly.Chu Liuyue actually chose to face Bai Chen head-on and formed a fist as well.Bang!A deep sound of impact was made.The duo\u2019s fists harshly smashed against each other.In comparison, Chu Liuyue\u2019s fist was only half the size of Bai Chen\u2019s. Her fist looked extremely small next to his.Some people could not help but hold their breaths as they thought, The bones in Chu Liuyue\u2019s hand will probably shatter.As expected, they saw Chu Liuyue\u2019s body shiver in the next moment as blood started trickling out of her mouth.Just when they thought everything was over, they saw that Bai Chen\u2019s face did not have any signs of happiness. Instead, there was shock.He widened his eyes and looked at Chu Liuyue as if he were looking at a weirdo. \u201cYou! You\u2026\u201d He opened his mouth, but he did not know what to say. However, his mind was thoroughly flipped around.Chu Liuyue\u2019s capabilities had exceeded his imagination.Logically speaking, Chu Liuyue should definitely not have been able to endure that punch. However, she was still standing in her original spot, without having even moved back an inch.Besides, he could clearly feel that Chu Liuyue\u2019s punch was much stronger than what he had expected.He silently clenched his teeth even harder.Kacha!The ground below Chu Liuyue started to crack, and the crack lines rapidly spread. However, Chu Liuyue did not move at all.In actual fact, her entire body was enduring an immense pressure. The strength within Bai Chen\u2019s punch was definitely not what an average stage-three warrior could exhibit. Even though she had already fixed her Yuan meridian and trained diligently these days, the difference between them was very large, and it was hard to overcome it.Her internal organs were squeezed into a ball by an invisible force as if they would explode in the next second. However, she had still met with this attack head-on.She looked at Bai Chen, and her clear, bright eyes sparkled. She enunciated every word clearly as she asked, \u201cSenior Bai Chen, do I pass this round?\u201dBai Chen clenched his teeth but did not retract his fist. His voice boomed as he said, \u201cPass!\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everyone looked at the court in shock and suspected that they had misheard something.What did Bai Chen say previously?Chu Liuyue\u2026 passed?After the temporary deadly silence, the crowd erupted into heated discussions.\u201cHow is that possible? How did Chu Liuyue pass that?\u201d\u201cExactly! She\u2019s not even a stage-one warrior, right? How can she pass so easily?\u201d\u201cDid she really just enter Tian Lu Academy like that? It\u2019s way too simple!\u201d\u201cEven though it\u2019s weird, Chu Liuyue seemed to have really endured Bai Chen\u2019s last move,\u201d muttered someone in confusion.Some people suddenly quietened down and looked at each other awkwardly.Oh, right!Bai Chen had said previously that Chu Liuyue would pass if she met and endured his move head-on.Chu Liuyue really did not move back a single step and had faced the impact forcefully.\u201cDid\u2026 Bai Chen do it on purpose?\u201d said someone uncertainly, but he hurriedly covered his mouth after he finished his sentence.Questioning Bai Chen in front of him was akin to questioning Tian Lu Academy.Bai Chen surveyed his surroundings with a gloomy gaze and took a deep breath before announcing, \u201cI know a lot of people might think that I\u2019ve let her off easily, but I dare to guarantee with my reputation that there was no problem in the entire assessment. Tian Lu Academy is the top academy, and we always conduct our assessments fairly. Chu Liuyue has indeed passed the warrior assessment.\u201dNot only did he not let her off easily, but he had even secretly increased the difficulty of the assessment. Even a true stage-three warrior might not be able to pass the assessment this smoothly. However, Chu Liuyue did it.Even though he looked down on her previously, he naturally admitted her abilities after she did this.Bai Chen\u2019s determined words had successfully stumped everyone else. Bai Chen was famous for his terrible temper as a teacher at Tian Lu Academy. Since he had confirmed Chu Liuyue\u2019s abilities, other people were in no position to say anything about it.Bai Chen looked at Chu Liuyue with a complicated gaze. He never expected Chu Liuyue to pass the assessment. \u201cFrom now on, you\u2019re a student at Tian Lu Academy.\u201dThe crowd went crazy.Originally, they thought that they could watch Chu Liuyue turn into a laughing stock today, but who knew she could really make it in? Only the top few talents in Country Yao Chen could enter Tian Lu Academy. It was really strange for an invalid like Chu Liuyue to be admitted.Chu Liuyue\u2019s red lips curved up. \u201cThank you, Senior Bai Chen, or perhaps I should call you Teacher Bai Chen.\u201dBai Chen grunted. He clearly saw that Chu Liuyue did not look shocked at all. Composure was written all over her face, and she had clearly expected this outcome. In other words, she was confident of her admission into the academy.Bai Chen previously thought that she was delusional for telling the Emperor that she wanted to enter Tian Lu Academy, but it seemed like she was clearly very confident of herself.\u201cEntering Tian Lu Academy is just the start. There\u2019s nothing to be proud of. You should know that the academy is filled with talents. Only the top few can become true, strong warriors.\u201d Bai Chen felt that he had lost face, so even though Chu Liuyue had passed the assessments, he did not give her a good time.In actual fact, he still looked down on Chu Liuyue. This was because he had never felt any force circulating within Chu Liuyue throughout the entire process. He did not know how she endured the last obstacle. A person lacking in a Yuan meridian could definitely not become a true cultivator.One could probably reach the standards of a stage-three warrior using other means, but it was impossible for them to advance.Even though Chu Liuyue had entered Tian Lu Academy, she would probably achieve nothing.After he finished his sentence, he waved his sleeves and was about to leave.\u201cTeacher Bai Chen, please wait a minute,\u201d said Chu Liuyue suddenly.Bai Chen turned around in frustration. \u201cWhat else do you want? You\u2019ve already passed the assessment. Someone will bring you into the academy later.\u201dChu Liuyue shook her head. \u201cTeacher Bai Chen, the assessment hasn\u2019t ended yet.\u201dBai Chen knitted his brows. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dChu Liuyue smiled and pointed at the two black, wooden boxes not far away. \u201cAren\u2019t there two more assessments?\u201dBai Chen\u2019s face turned cold. \u201cDidn\u2019t you previously hear the rules properly? You only need to pass one assessment out of the three.\u201d Now that Chu Liuyue had already passed the warrior assessment, she did not need to carry on with the other two.Chu Liuyue blinked. \u201cCan a person only be assessed in one category?\u201d\u201cDo you not understand\u2026\u201d Bai Chen suddenly paused in his sentence. Hold on, Chu Liuyue is saying\u2026\u201cTeacher Bai Chen, from what I know, there\u2019s no such restriction in the academy\u2019s assessments, right?\u201dBai Chen did not speak for quite some time. They prepared three different assessments because there were three types of cultivators in Mainland Xuan Wu.Different people had different talents. Even though some were untalented as a warrior, they had shocking potential in other areas. This type of person would either be a Xuan Master or a heavenly doctor. There were very few such people, and even more so for heavenly doctors as there might not even be one in ten thousand.\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that\u2026?\u201d Bai Chen opened his mouth and became nervous for some reason.Chu Liuyue took a step forward and said calmly, \u201cI\u2019m saying that I want to be assessed in the other two categories.\u201dLiked it?

    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: How Fragrant!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euThe entire court was deadly silent.Everyone looked at Chu Liuyue as if they were staring at a maniac. Is she out of her mind? She wants to be assessed on the last two categories? Does she think that she really can pass all three assessments?Only a few people could pass all three assessments in the entire Country Yao Chen.Bai Chen knitted his brows very tightly. \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re asking? You really want to be assessed on the last two categories?\u201dChu Liuyue nodded.Bai Chen was silent for a moment before he waved his sleeves and clenched his teeth. \u201cOkay. I do want to see what kind of tricks you can pull off.\u201d After he finished his sentence, he signaled Chu Liuyue to open the remaining two boxes.Chu Liuyue walked over and opened the one in the middle. There was a piece of paper and a chessboard inside.The black and white chess pieces were already placed on the chessboard, forming an endgame.Chu Liuyue took one look at it and noticed that the chess pieces were placed in a regular manner to form an array formation on the chessboard.The requirement for the Xuan Master assessment was written on the paper\u2014\u201dYou\u2019ll pass if you manage to solve this chessboard in two hours.\u201dPerhaps two hours to solve an endgame was a tad too long for an average person, but in actual fact, this assessment was completely different from a normal chess game.The black and white chess pieces, more or less, had the forces from heaven and earth. They were placed in different positions and influenced each other, naturally forming a complicated chess game.If she wanted to solve this problem, she needed to feel the circulating force between heaven and earth sensitively.This point alone stumped most people. Even though some people could forcefully feel the circulating force, they could not clearly see the pattern amongst the pieces, let alone figure out the solution for the endgame. Hence, only truly talented people with the potential to become a Xuan Master could pass this assessment.Bai Chen walked over, and his gaze landed on Chu Liuyue. \u201cYou need to take the chessboard out\u2026\u201dIt would be easier for students to take the assessment as it lasted for two hours after all.Chu Liuyue shook her head in rejection. \u201cThank you, Teacher Bai Chen, for the kind reminder, but it\u2019s okay.\u201dBai Chen paused and sneered in his heart. She must have rejected it so decisively because she knows that she can\u2019t solve it and wants to give up.He grunted. \u201cDon\u2019t act strong if you don\u2019t have the patience. Do you think it\u2019s so easy to become a Xuan Master?\u201d As he spoke, he was about to close the box.When Chu Liuyue heard this, she pressed her lips against each other tightly. Is Bai Chen so sure that I can\u2019t pass and thought that I was going to give up?\u201cTeacher Bai Chen, wait a minute.\u201dBai Chen looked at her in frustration. What else is she going to play at?However, Chu Liuyue already picked up a black chess piece and placed it on the chessboard precisely without hesitation.Piak!The chessboard made a soft sound.Bai Chen was just about to scold her, but he suddenly felt a strange movement from the chessboard.He looked over subconsciously and saw that the black and white chess pieces were as if controlled by an invisible force and had flown up gradually before landing precisely in the chess compartment beside it.Pilihuala!The chess pieces knocked against each other crisply, but it sounded like thunder in other people\u2019s ears.Chu Liuyue had actually succeeded in solving the endgame!Bai Chen stood there dazedly and could not recover his senses for a long time.H-how long did Chu Liuyue take to solve it?It seemed like it had not even been a quarter of an hour.Including the conversation time between both of them, Chu Liuyue literally solved the chess puzzle after looking at it a few times.Bai Chen was really shocked.He had been in Tian Lu Academy for many years and had seen numerous Xuan Master talents, but he had never seen one that could solve this assessment so quickly and accurately.One either had to know the answer beforehand or be extremely talented to be this fast!This chessboard was one of Tian Lu Academy\u2019s treasured items. It would form different endgames for the various assessments. Even he did not know what the chessboard would look like before he opened the wooden box.This feat meant that Chu Liuyue was, indeed, very talented as a Xuan Master.All along, Bai Chen felt that Chu Liuyue had passed the previous warrior assessment by playing some tricks since he did not feel any force circulating in her body. If not, there really was no explanation for how she exuded such an intense suppressive aura and even faced his move head-on. However, everything in front of Bai Chen made him realize that Chu Liuyue was indeed talented.At the very least, she had the potential to become a top Xuan Master.\u201cTeacher Bai Chen, do I pass the test?\u201d Chu Liuyue\u2019s lips curved up into a smile, and spoke in her usual nonchalant manner as if she did not notice how shocking her performance was.However, Bai Chen could not be as calm as her. His heart felt like it had been flipped right over. That was because\u2026 he was also a Xuan Master!After entering Tian Lu Academy, the students would usually be assigned to various teachers to undergo cultivation. This was even more so for Xuan Masters and heavenly doctors as they were unique.Every teacher could be considered as individuals.There were quite a few Xuan Master teachers in Tian Lu Academy. They were all very competitive, especially when it came to showing off how incredible the students they taught were.Bai Chen was very confident that Chu Liuyue was a very rare Xuan Master talent that would only appear once every 100 years.Chu Liuyue waited for a while; when she saw that Bai Chen did not say anything, she could not help but call him. \u201cTeacher Bai Chen?\u201dBai Chen suddenly recovered his senses, and he looked at Chu Liuyue as if he was looking at a precious treasure. He rubbed his hands together, and a passionate smile was plastered onto his face, which looked very weird with his originally stern look.\u201cPass! Pass! Of course, you pass! Hehe, Little Liuyue, what other requests do you have? Just name them! I\u2019ll do it for you!\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: All-Kill!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euChu Liuyue\u2019s eyes twitched.Little Liuyue?Previously his face was still filled with frustration, yet his attitude completely changed in the blink of an eye. His face change came faster than flipping a book page.\u201cUm\u2026 Teacher Bai Chen, you don\u2019t have to be so polite\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean polite? Since you\u2019re a student of Tian Lu Academy, I should take care of you as a teacher,\u201d said Bai Chen hurriedly. As he talked, he carefully observed Chu Liuyue\u2019s expression and secretly regretted it in his heart.How could I treat her in that way previously? Little Liuyue must have had a bad impression of me. If I knew that she had such formidable talent as a Xuan Master, I would have treated her nicely. Upon thinking this, he could not help but ask about the Chu family\u2019s 18 generations in his heart.Invalid? How useless the Chu family is! They do not have the eyes to recognize true talent and even implicated me.If he did not trust the rumors he heard, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have treated her that way.\u201cLittle Liuyue\u2026 I had a bad attitude towards you previously. Please, don\u2019t take it to heart,\u201d said Bai Chen embarrassingly as he scratched his head.Chu Liuyue looked at him in shock but saw that, although Bai Chen looked awkward, his gaze was sincere and honest. He was genuinely apologizing.Chu Liuyue blinked. This person is quite interesting.It was true that he looked down on her before, and also true that he wanted to get close to her.Was this change because she showed off her Xuan Master talent earlier? However, she had already tried her best to restrain her talent.This endgame was too simple. She had started learning array formations when she was four, and she could create Xuan arrays when she was five. She did not even care about such array formations. However, it seemed like she had to lie even lower now.\u201cI know that capabilities are the most important thing. Teacher Bai Chen, you don\u2019t have to take it to heart.\u201dBai Chen was rather sincere when he dared to apologize to her in front of everyone as he had a relatively high status. This gave Chu Liuyue a better impression of him.This type of person was very straightforward. One only had to show their true abilities to change their attitudes.Bai Chen finally heaved a sigh of relief after hearing her say that and hurriedly asked her. \u201cThen, do you still want to continue with the heavenly doctor assessment?\u201dThe heavenly doctor assessment was even harder than the Xuan Master assessment. Previously, he thought that Chu Liuyue was just acting strong, but now he was slightly expectant.Perhaps\u2026 she was also talented as a heavenly doctor?Chu Liuyue looked down.She originally thought that the Xuan Master assessment was a piece of cake, but she did not expect to shock these people. Based on Bai Chen\u2019s reaction alone, this incident was bound to spread like wildfire.The winds howl around the highest peaks. She had to be more careful about the heavenly doctor assessment.Chu Liuyue nodded. \u201cContinue.\u201d As she spoke, she opened the third box and took out the question paper from inside.\u201cProduce a drug formula with the ten herbs given.\u201dChu Liuyue took a look inside the wooden box and saw that the herbs were split into ten different compartments, with different herbs in each of them.Her eyes darted quickly, and she recognized the different herbs.Most of them were very common herbs, but their natures were different. Some were cold, and others were hot.Amongst these different herbs was a Silver Ice Cicada, which was also known as cold herb; it was extremely poisonous.Examinees needed to have thorough knowledge of all these herbs and neutralize their effects in order to create a good drug formula.One would fail if they weren\u2019t careful. One might even produce a poisonous drug instead of a useful one.The handling of the cold herb was the most important aspect.Of course, Chu Liuyue knew how to handle the cold herb and remove the poison in it, but she obviously could not show it now.After thinking deeply, she took out the herbs one by one, ground some into powder, and juiced the others. Then, she combined them in different ratios.Chu Liuyue\u2019s movements were slightly hesitant in the entire process, and she would sometimes make a small mistake.Bai Chen shook his head silently while watching at the side. Even though he was not a heavenly doctor, he had some understanding of medicine.Chu Liuyue was talented in this area, but her talent was very limited.An hour passed very quickly. Chu Liuyue finally finished her drug and passed it to Bai Chen.Bai Chen took a look at it and shook his head. \u201cThis\u2026 You barely passed, but\u2026\u201d It\u2019s nothing much. This talent could only help her become a doctor, but not a true heavenly doctor.Actually, it was already rare to find doctors. If others could pass this assessment, they would definitely be over the moon, but Bai Chen had previously seen Chu Liuyue\u2019s outstanding performance as a Xuan Master. This was just a let down in comparison to that.Chu Liuyue asked, \u201cTeacher Bai Chen, do I pass this assessment?\u201dBai Chen quickly erased his other thoughts and looked at Chu Liuyue emotionally before laughing. \u201cOf course, you pass! Little Liuyue, you\u2019ve passed all three assessments and have been admitted to Tian Lu Academy! Not many people in Country Yao Chen can do this.\u201dHis deep voice boomed, and it clearly echoed throughout the court.Everyone was in a daze.What?What just happened?Not only did Chu Liuyue enter Tian Lu Academy, but she also passed the assessments with an all-kill?Was the world crazy?Liked it?

I\u2019ll show you around the academy!\u201d Bai Chen was very emotional and excited since he could not wait to accept Chu Liuyue as his disciple. It would be the biggest regret in his life if he missed such a talented Xuan Master.He was upset about being sent to host the assessment at first, but now he was just very grateful for the chance. He could enjoy the benefits of this favorable position and win Chu Liuyue over before the other fellows found out about her talent.Looking at his excited expression, Chu Liuyue could not help but laugh. \u201cTeacher Bai Chen, isn\u2019t this too soon?\u201d\u201cNo! Not soon at all! You didn\u2019t make it for the admission in January, so you\u2019re very late when compared to the other students. More than half of the semester is now over. You must hurry up and catch up with them. It\u2019s better if you follow me around to familiarize yourself with the environment first at the very least.\u201dWhen he said that, he suddenly thought of something and slapped his thigh. \u201cOh, right. After you start school, will you be living in the Chu family estate or in the academy? If you\u2019re living in the academy, I\u2019ll get someone to arrange your lodging.\u201dTian Lu Academy\u2019s students were normally free to choose. Students with homes in the Imperial City would normally choose to stay at home. Whereas the other students who came from other parts of the country would choose to stay in the academy.Tian Lu Academy was the top academy in Country Yao Chen, so it definitely had decent facilities. However, when compared to the various distinguished families\u2019 estates in the Imperial City, it was still considered simple and basic. Thus, many aristocratic children would spend more time at home, apart from their cultivation training.Speaking of which, Chu Liuyue was also the Chu family\u2019s legitimate eldest daughter. However, Bai Chen knew very clearly that Chu Liuyue did not have a good life after being called an invalid for more than a decade.Besides, the news of her dissolving her marriage agreement with the Crown Prince was still spreading like wildfire amongst the public. There were probably only very few people in the Chu family who treated her genuinely.Seeing Bai Chen\u2019s enthusiasm, Chu Liuyue\u2019s heart tingled slightly since she knew that he was thinking for her. She bowed. \u201cI\u2019ll have to trouble you then, Teacher Bai Chen.\u201dBai Chen was slightly shocked and waved his hand. \u201cIn the future, I\u2019m also considered your teacher. What\u2019s there to thank when it\u2019s such a small matter? If you don\u2019t have anything else to do, why don\u2019t you follow me around the academy?\u201dChu Liuyue nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201dAs they talked, the duo walked towards Tian Lu Academy one after another.The crowd then finally comprehended what had happened thoroughly. Looking at the thin, young girl, they could not even utter a single word in a short amount of time.Who would have thought that she could make it this far?Bai Chen also clearly looked very impressed by her.Chu Liuyue would no longer be the Chu family\u2019s invalid that could be bullied by anyone and everyone in the future.Chu Liuyue walked towards the entrance, step by step, and suddenly paused for a while as her gaze slowly swept past the three words \u2018Tian Lu Academy.\u2019She was finally admitted to the top academy in Country Yao Chen. However, this was just the beginning.After Chu Liuyue followed Bai Chen into Tian Lu Academy, the happenings of that day spread across the entire Imperial City rapidly as if the news had wings.\u2026Finally, Chu Liuyue formally entered Tian Lu Academy after passing through the boundary at the entrance.The moment she walked in, she immediately felt that the surrounding Heaven and Earth Force was much stronger than outside.When she was outside, she could already see that a gigantic boundary covered Tian Lu Academy. The boundary was clearly built using a Xuan formation, which merged with the entire academy perfectly.One look across and Chu Liuyue had already noticed quite a few Xuan formation focal points.She raised her brows and was quite surprised.Tian Lu Academy\u2019s Xuan formation was much stronger than what she had imagined. It was indeed surprising to see such quality in the small Country Yao Chen. It seemed like it was a wise decision to come to Tian Lu Academy.Bai Chen had been secretly observing Chu Liuyue the entire time. When he saw the changes in her expression, his heart tingled. \u201cLittle Liuyue, did you feel something?\u201dChu Liuyue naturally knew that he was testing her and smiled. \u201cThe academy\u2026 seems to be different from the outside world. It seems like there\u2019s\u2026 the power from a Xuan formation.\u201d\u201cYou really noticed it!\u201d Bai Chen was very excited, and he sighed in his heart. Chu Liuyue is really the most talented person I have seen in so many years when it comes to Xuan Masters. When he thought of this, he could not help but ask, \u201cLittle Liuyue, you are very gifted as a Xuan Master, why didn\u2019t you\u2026\u201dEven Bai Chen did not have the face to continue with his sentence. Everyone knew that Chu Liuyue was labeled as a \u2018good-for-nothing\u2019 for more than a decade. Even he thought the same way before the assessment today.Logically speaking, a family like the Chu family would definitely not miss such a talent\u2026Chu Liuyue smiled nonchalantly. \u201cIt\u2019s all matters of the past. I\u2019ve also just coincidentally discovered that I have a little talent.\u201dBai Chen muttered to himself, \u201cIf that\u2019s \u2018little,\u2019 then there won\u2019t be many talented people in the entire Country Yao Chen.\u201dIt\u2019s a pity that Chu Liuyue discovered her potential so late. Her capabilities would be much greater if her talent was discovered a few years earlier. The Chu family basically delayed her development.Bai Chen thought about this in his heart, but he did not continue talking when he saw that Chu Liuyue seemed reluctant to talk about this topic. Then, he started to introduce the academy to her in detail.\u201cEnough of that! Since you\u2019re a Tian Lu Academy student from now on, you\u2019ll be very different from the past. I believe you can also feel that the force inside the academy is much stronger than the outside world. This is because there\u2019s a Pit of Heavenly Origins in the academy. That Pit of Heavenly Origins can produce vast amounts of Heaven and Earth Force on its own. Back then, our first director created this Xuan formation to suppress the Pit of Heavenly Origins so that training in the academy would be much faster than training outside.\u201dChu Liuyue\u2019s eyes sparkled. This was her real motive for coming to Tian Lu Academy.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That\u2019s the closest place to the Pit of Heavenly Origins. The Heaven and Earth force is even more concentrated there! It\u2019s a few times stronger! It takes half the amount of effort to cultivate in there!\u201dChu Liuyue pointedly looked at it before she smiled. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, won\u2019t spending a year in there be the equivalent of cultivating for years outside?\u201d\u201cHaha! That may be true, but no one has been able to spend that much time in there to date! The force is really concentrated in Jiuyou Tower, but it\u2019s precisely because of this that it puts a lot of pressure on the cultivators! Even a stage-three warrior can only last a maximum of three days in there! If you remain in there forcibly, not only will it not be beneficial to your cultivation, but it will also cause a great deal of harm to your body, even to your life!\u201dAt this point, Bai Chen\u2019s expression was much more serious. \u201cYou should know the idea of being unable to digest too much food.\u201dChu Liuyue nodded.\u201cBut you can\u2019t just randomly enter Jiuyou Tower either. You just need a basic understanding of these places for now.\u201d Bai Chen looked like he wanted to say something as he looked at Chu Liuyue. \u201cIt\u2019ll be better for you to look at this Xuan formation if you have time.\u201dChu Liuyue smiled and did not say a word. She knew what Bai Chen was trying to say: It would be futile for someone with a damaged Yuan meridian to enter that place.Only Xuan Masters did not have a requirement for the Yuan meridian. All they had to do was to feel the inner workings of the force.What Bai Chen said was in consideration for her.Chu Liuyue did not explain much either. It was not necessarily a bad thing to enter as a Xuan Master. It would make a lot of things easier in the future while leaving her with a backup plan. It killed many birds with one stone.\u201cThat\u2019s the academy\u2019s martial arts center. Students will usually spar there. To the side is the fighting ring. Students usually use it to challenge one another.\u201d As Bai Chen led her towards the academy, he explained many things to her. \u201cToday can be considered your admission day. As you know, the academy only takes the most talented prodigies to develop them to their greatest potential. The academy is also rather particular about the way it teaches.\u201dBai Chen raised three fingers \u201cWarriors, Xuan Masters and heavenly doctors! The academy is divided into three main sections, but the number of Xuan Masters is only one-tenth that of the warriors. As for heavenly doctors\u2026 there are even fewer of them. There\u2019s only about a dozen of them.\u201d And only less than a third of them will become true heavenly doctors.\u201cStudents will be assigned to different teachers based on their results after they enter the academy. People with different talents will naturally have different teachers. But\u2026 if the student is extremely talented, sometimes a few teachers will fight over a student. We always let the student make the choice in cases like this,\u201d said Bai Chen as he coughed.\u201cTake me for example. Even though I\u2019m a stage-five warrior, I\u2019m also a Xuan Master. I usually teach Xuan Masters as well.Chu Liuyue nodded in understanding.Warriors were not rare. In comparison, Xuan Masters had a more prestigious status. It was normal that he would choose to teach Xuan Masters.At the same time, Chu Liuyue finally understood why his attitude shifted when she exhibited her Xuan Master talent.He clearly wanted to take her as his student! However, Chu Liuyue did not want to rush into a decision too early, so she did not say anything. She just maintained a smile on her face.Bai Chen was a little disappointed by her reaction, but he knew that he did not have any grounds to ask Chu Liuyue to choose him as her teacher because of his earlier attitude toward her.Chu Liuyue changed the topic. \u201cTeacher Bai Chen, why is the academy so quiet? We\u2019ve been walking around here for a while, but I haven\u2019t seen anyone?\u201dBai Chen paused, then laughed out loud. \u201cHaha! That\u2019s because the academy\u2019s three-day-long mid-term exams have begun. Today is the first day. All the students and teachers are in the back mountain!\u201dMid-term exams? That sounds a little familiar\u2026 If I recall correctly, Chu Xianmin aimed to place first in this exam earlier?At this point, there were a few female voices.\u201cMinmin, let\u2019s walk faster. The exam is about to start!\u201d\u201cWhy are you so anxious, Peipei? Don\u2019t we still have time? Besides, Minmin has always been well-liked by our teachers. They won\u2019t reprimand us even if we\u2019re late. Right, Minmin?\u201d\u201cEven so, it\u2019s not good to be late. We better hurry up. It\u2019s all my fault. If I hadn\u2019t been delayed by a family matter, we wouldn\u2019t have been this late.\u201dChu Liuyue looked towards the voice and saw a few girls walking further up. Chu Xianmin was the one at the front.\u201cMinmin, you\u2019re just too kind. I heard that you got punished by your father because of that Chu Liuyue! That loser is clearly just taking revenge on you because you\u2019re better than her!\u201dAt the mention of Chu Liuyue, Chu Xianmin\u2019s expression froze for an instant but quickly reverted to the way it was earlier. \u201cNo matter what, she\u2019s still my older sister\u2026\u201d\u201cHmph, her? I remember today is the day she\u2019s taking the entrance exam, right? She really isn\u2019t afraid of embarrassing herself. If I were her, I would have killed myself out of shame already! Minmin, you\u2019re capable of placing first in our academy, and she\u2019s just a loser who can\u2019t even get into our school. What can she use to compete with you?\u201dChu Xianmin pursed her lips and kept her glee to herself. She suddenly felt that something was wrong at this point. She turned her head and saw a familiar face. Chu Liuyue?!\u201cYou\u2026 why are you here?!\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When she saw her now, she wanted to rush up and teach Chu Liuyue a lesson! But when the words were in her mouth, she suddenly noticed someone standing next to Chu Liuyue.It was Teacher Bai Chen from the academy!She forcibly swallowed her words and retracted her vicious gaze. When she looked up and glanced at Bai Chen, she had her usual warm smile plastered on her face. \u201cGreetings, Teacher Bai Chen.\u201dThe others around her only came to their senses then and began greeting him too. \u201cGreetings, Teacher Bai Chen!\u201dBai Chen frowned without saying a word. He had clearly heard the entire conversation from earlier!Setting the enmity between Chu Liuyue and Chu Xianmin aside, Chu Liuyue had never provoked the others. He never expected them to be so harsh with their words while conversing!Although Chu Liuyue was not his treasure, he could not bear to hear anyone insult or defame her!Bai Chen had an explosive temper, and his heart was burning with rage from everything he had heard.Chu Xianmin worriedly exchanged glances with the others when she felt Bai Chen\u2019s anger. Did he hear everything that we said earlier? Even if he did, we were talking about Chu Liuyue, so why is he getting upset?\u201cThe academy recruited you here to cultivate and become stronger, not for you to gossip. If your heart is not focused on cultivating, you should leave as soon as you can!\u201d Bai Chen\u2019s harsh words were to the point.The girls turned pale.This was a little harsh! They had never been reprimanded like this before, and they felt their faces begin to burn. But given Bai Chen\u2019s status, they dared not talk back. The few of them furtively glanced at Chu Xianmin for help.Only Chu Xianmin, the teachers\u2019 favorite, could save them now.Chu Xianmin was also shocked by Bai Chen. We just said a few things about Chu Liuyue. Did he have to act out like this? \u201cTeacher Bai Chen, you might be a little mistaken. It was just a passing comment. We don\u2019t have any ill will\u2026\u201dHowever, Bai Chen clearly did not feel like letting them off today. \u201cOh? So you\u2019re saying that I misheard?\u2019Chu Xianmin was stunned. The academy\u2019s teachers usually did not treat her like this, but today\u2026\u201cMinmin did not mean it that way. She was just asking because she was surprised to see her sister here.\u201dThey changed the topic, attempting to shift the attention away from their insults toward Chu Liuyue.At the same time, Chu Xianmin promptly recalled something. Bai Chen is the one sent to assess Chu Liuyue today! Looking at the time, the assessment should have ended by now. But why is Chu Liuyue here, instead of going home?Chu Liuyue narrowed her eyes. With a half-smile, she said, \u201cI\u2019m taking Tian Lu Academy\u2019s entrance examination today. Didn\u2019t you know, Third Sister? Weren\u2019t you just talking about this earlier?\u201dChu Xianmin gritted her teeth silently, but could barely keep her smile on her face. \u201cYes\u2026 that was why I\u2019m curious. Teacher Bai Chen, the academy rules state that ordinary people can\u2019t come in, right?\u201dThe others behind her began grumbling as well.\u201cYeah, how can Chu Liuyue the outsider come in?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a violation of the rules\u2026\u201dBai Chen laughed coldly. \u201cAgainst the rules? Am I the teacher, or are you? I\u2019m telling you that Chu Liuyue is a student of Tian Lu Academy from today onward! What\u2019s wrong with her coming in here?\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Chu Xianmin cried out in surprise and looked at Chu Liuyue in disbelief. \u201cHow can that be?\u201d How could Chu Liuyue possibly get admitted to Tian Lu Academy?Bai Chen usually did not deal with Chu Xianmin, but now he was getting impatient. When compared with a Xuan Master, what is Chu Xianmin\u2019s so-called talent? The Chu family is a family of fools!\u201cWhy, are you questioning me?\u201d asked Bai Chen coldly.Chu Xianmin returned to her senses and hurriedly said, \u201cNo, no! I just\u2026\u201d\u201cTeacher Bai Chen, are you sure you didn\u2019t make a mistake? Chu Liuyue has a defective Yuan meridian! She was born a good-for-nothing! How does she have the ability to enter the academy?\u201d The girl called Peipei could not stop herself from voicing her suspicions as she looked at Chu Liuyue with doubt and hatred.Bai Chen was so upset that he started laughing. \u201cI\u2019m telling you that not only did she make the cut, but she also passed all three assessments!\u201dChu Xianmin and the others were stunned. When they realized the meaning of Bai Chen\u2019s words, they had very colorful expressions on their face!Caught between laughter and tears, Chu Liuyue looked at Bai Chen. He came to her defense before she could say anything.Chu Xianmin\u2019s face turned green then white, unable to believe what she had heard.But how could it be fake? Bai Chen was standing next to Chu Liuyue!What means did Chu Liuyue use! It was like a fire was burning in her chest, and she could barely stand!\u201cMinmin, Peipei, why aren\u2019t you all here yet? The exam is starting now! All the teachers are looking for you all! You\u2019ll be late if you don\u2019t leave now!\u201d Someone appeared in the distance at this time.An idea flashed across Chu Xiamin\u2019s mind, and she looked at Chu Liuyue. \u201cSister, you came at the perfect time. The mid-term exam period is the academy\u2019s most exciting time. Why don\u2019t you go take a look? If you\u2019re interested, you can take part as well. This is a chance for you to familiarize yourself with more people in the academy. What do you think?\u201dIs she trying to get a feel of my abilities? Chu Liuyue smiled. \u201cSure.\u201d\u2026Zhen Bao Pavilion was especially lively today. It was not noon yet, but quite a number of people had gathered on the first floor, and they were all people of status.They were all here for the same reason\u2014Zhen Bao Pavilion had recently received a fresh batch of treasures, and they were holding an auction for them today!The pamphlet had been sent to the various families a few days ago. There were a few rare items, so several people showed up.Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2019s second-in-charge, Yan Ge, was making small talk with various people.\u201cSecond Master Yan, we have waited so long for today\u2019s auction!\u201d\u201cYeah! I wonder who those few items will end up with!\u201d\u201cHehe, you\u2019ll know when the auction starts! You\u2019ve worked hard, Second Master Yan!\u201dYan Ge was full of smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I have to thank you all for gracing me with your presence today\u2026\u201dAt this point, an attendant hurried over to Yan Ge, whispered into his ear, and handed him a letter.Yan Ge smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Everyone, please excuse me.\u201d With that, he retreated into the small room behind the main hall and carefully opened the letter. \u201cWhy would Master suddenly send a letter now\u2026\u201dYan Ge\u2019s words were cut short by what he read, and he widened his eyes in shock! His expression changed rapidly, and it took him a while to calm himself down.After a while, he walked out and stood in the middle of the hall. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, everyone. Today\u2019s auction is canceled.\u201dEveryone seated was stunned.\u201cWhat?! Canceled?!\u201d\u201cWhat is going on? We\u2019ve been waiting all morning, and you just decide to cancel it?\u201dYan Ge shrugged apologetically, but his tone was firm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, everyone. However, there\u2019s a good reason for this cancellation. Our master said that everything in Zhen Bao Pavilion, including the new batch of treasures, is temporarily not available for transaction. He would like to pick a gift for Madam from them personally.\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They could make an appeal if it were another reason, but it was him\u2026He was not someone to be trifled with!Yan Ge chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, everyone. To make up for everyone\u2019s loss, Zhen Bao Pavilion will send a little gift to you all after this; we also seek your forgiveness.\u201dThe crowd only relaxed when they heard that. This gave them some leeway; thus, they took it.\u201cSecond Master Yan, you\u2019re too kind! Since it\u2019s the master\u2019s request, we can only oblige!\u201d\u201cOf course! Zhen Bao Pavilion has been in business in the Imperial City for years. How can we make things difficult for them? We\u2019ll just wait!\u201d\u201cA gift is not necessary. Second Master Yan is too kind!\u201dEveryone present was the elites of Imperial City. What mattered the most to them was not wealth but their status and image. They would not let things slide so easily if this were a different place, but the place in question was Zhen Bao Pavilion.They still had their reservations.Yan Ge chuckled and continued speaking. \u201cThank you, everyone! We\u2019ll gift everyone a Pobi Elixir later as an apology.\u201dThe crowd was shocked by what they heard.Pobi Elixir? That was a rare, top-tier elixir!Advancing from a third-stage warrior to a fourth-stage warrior was a huge challenge for all cultivators. Many never made the leap, forever remaining in the third stage. However, one\u2019s chances of succeeding in the breakthrough would double with a Pobi Elixir!Although it might not sound like an impressive effect, it could help some people break through successfully and advance to the next stage.Pobi Elixirs were extremely precious! Regular families could never get their hands on one! Even an existence like the four big clans could only produce a few! But Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2026 was giving one to each person present!There were at least 20 to 30 people here. One for each person, that was\u2026 Also, the Pobi Elixirs were just as an apology!Zhen Bao Pavilion was really generous!Some people\u2019s expressions changed as they began to reassess Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2019s standing. Such a number of Pobi Elixirs simply could not be obtained through wealth\u2026What exactly was this place\u2019s background? And who exactly was their secretive Master who never showed his face?The Pobi Elixir managed to quell all the people\u2019s discontent. Even if they were still unhappy, they could not say anything more.After a while, someone began to joke around. \u201cSecond Master Yan, Zhen Bao Pavilion is losing a lot of money over this! Your Master can really bear to part with his money, huh!\u201dYan Ge stood up straight and laughed graciously. \u201cNah, our Master and Madam love one another. What is all this if it can make Madam happy?\u201dEveryone present laughed out loud and soon began leaving one after another.Soon, the hall was empty, leaving Yan Ge and a few pageboys behind.When everyone had left, and the door was closed, Yan Ge heaved a sigh of relief. He rubbed his face that was stiff from smiling forcefully before he turned and entered the small room behind the main hall.\u201cWhen did Master get a wife?!\u201d he asked anxiously. Only he knew how stunned he was when he saw the letter from Master.The pageboy coughed. \u201cI also only found out today. It should be\u2026 a recent development\u2026\u201d\u201cYou follow Master around every day. Shouldn\u2019t you know this?\u201d Yan Ge did not buy it. He immediately stepped forward and took the letter out again. He read it a few more times, and was still upset.\u201cI\u2019ve been following Master for so many years, yet I wasn\u2019t aware of this at all! It\u2019s fine that Master didn\u2019t tell me, but he also didn\u2019t tell you? Things almost got out of control by springing this on me!\u201d The pageboy felt wronged. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of this either! If you really want to know, go ask Master yourself!\u201dYan Ge was shut down immediately. He did not have the guts to do that! After pondering for a moment, he could not help but ask questions. \u201cHey, who exactly is Madam? You\u2019ve got to know that at least, right? Tell me? At least I won\u2019t offend her in the future!\u201dThe pageboy sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon.\u201dYan Ge was more curious when he heard that. Their Master had not been interested in women before. How did he suddenly get a wife? What kind of fairy was able to conquer their Master?\u201cI\u2019ve delivered the letter, so I\u2019ll be heading off first. Settle whatever you need to get done here. Master will be here soon.\u201d The pageboy left in a hurry after that.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d Yan Ge rubbed his throbbing head as he watched the pageboy leave. Master risked offending all the elites of Imperial City just to choose a present for Madam\u2026 It looks like it\u2019s true love this time!\u2026Tian Lu Academy, back mountain.Many students were gathered here. There was chatter all around, and it was lively.Excitement and nervousness were clear on their young faces.\u201cI wonder what this year\u2019s exam format is! I heard that the prizes are especially good!\u201d\u201cThe academy has always been generous, so what\u2019s so special about that? The important question is if we can place in the top few!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true! The higher one\u2019s rank, the better the reward! The three sections\u2019 students are examined and will produce three top scholars. The top scholar for our section has to be Chu Xianmin, right?\u201d\u201cSigh, speaking of her, why isn\u2019t she here yet? Teacher Bai Chen isn\u2019t back yet either.\u201dAs the crowd chattered, Bai Chen and the others finally arrived.A teacher wearing a green robe, who was preparing for the exam, waved at Bai Chen when he saw the latter. \u201cBai Chen, you\u2019re finally back! Why did you take so long with administering one exam? You still have to deal with the Xuan formation\u2026\u201dBai Chen laughed and cut him off. \u201cLing Zhu, I was not wasting time. I found a treasure for our academy!\u201d His voice was loud, plus he had his mind set on backing Chu Liuyue up, so his words spread and rang clear in everyone\u2019s ears!Everyone looked over.Ling Zhu looked at him confusedly. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dBai Chen laughed out loud as he stepped aside and motioned for Chu Liuyue to step forward.Chu Liuyue bowed graciously. \u201cLiuyue greets Teacher Ling Zhu.\u201dLiuyue? Chu Liuyue?! Ling Zhu eyed her from top to bottom and looked at Bai Chen with a frown. \u201cBai Chen, you\u2026\u201d\u201cLittle Liuyue has passed all three exams and is officially a part of our academy! I just brought her here to check things out!\u201d His words silenced the lively back mountain.Seeing that Chu Liuyue had stood out again, Chu Xianmin stepped forward with a smile. \u201cTeacher Ling Zhu, my sister wants to take part in the exam as well.\u201dLiked it?

The academy\u2019s exam is beginning soon. You can\u2019t joke around like this.\u201dBai Chen chuckled. \u201cAm I the kind of person to joke about this? Since Little Liuyue is part of our academy, what\u2019s wrong with her taking part in the exam?\u201dLing Zhu was still doubtful, and he took another close look at Chu Liuyue.Everyone in the Imperial City knew that Chu Liuyue was born a good-for-nothing. Otherwise, she would not have been bullied by everyone as the Chu family\u2019s Big Chu Missy. But Bai Chen was now saying that not only did Chu Liuyue make the cut for the academy, but she also passed all three assessments?How could that be? There was only a handful who managed that in the history of the academy. However, he knew Bai Chen well. The guy had a straightforward personality; he would not have been that kind to anyone without any ability. But he clearly really liked Chu Liuyue!Seeing that Ling Zhu had not spoken in a while, Bai Chen waved his hand impatiently. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. I know none of you will believe me. You can just see her ability for yourself later when the exam begins!\u201dLing Zhu could only go along with it since Bai Chen had brought up the idea. \u201cThat works too. Which exam is she taking?\u201dChu Xianmin also paid close attention to the conversation. She really wanted to know what Chu Liuyue relied on, to be able to take the exam so boldly!Bai Chen popped up in front of Chu Liuyue, his face full of smiles. \u201cLittle Liuyue, which exam do you want to take? Actually, the Xuan Master examination is a little easier. It also won\u2019t take too long. How about you pick this one?\u201dLing Zhu shook his head to himself. He really did not know what was up with Bai Chen. The shortest exam was clearly the warrior one. The other two, no matter whether it was the Xuan Master examination or heavenly doctor examination, was time and energy-consuming.Bai Chen clearly wanted Chu Liuyue to take the Xuan Master examination, but why\u2026?Chu Liuyue knew what Bai Chen was thinking, so she smiled right back at him. \u201cThanks for the tip, Teacher Bai Chen. I\u2019ll take the Xuan Master examination then!\u201dThe students in the crowd began whispering to one another when they heard that.\u201cChe, she\u2019s good at acting. I refuse to believe that she really can pass all three exams. She has a defective Yuan meridian. How can she possibly pass the warrior exam?\u201d\u201cWho knows what means she used to pass the assessment? If she were really capable, she should just take the warrior exam and prove herself!\u201d\u201cHowever, Teacher Bai Chen clearly seems to care about her a lot\u2026 Doesn\u2019t he usually dislike mediocre but ambitious students?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Who knows! We\u2019ll find out in a bit!\u201dBai Chen\u2019s expression turned cold when he heard that, and was about to explode. \u201cThese kids! I\u2019ve got to\u2026\u201dHowever, Chu Liuyue shook her head with a smile. \u201cTeacher Bai Chen, it\u2019s normal for people to have doubts. I\u2019ll make sure that they\u2019re silenced by the end of the exam.\u201dBai Chen felt much better when he saw how calm and confident she was. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll silence them with your prowess!\u201dBai Chen explained things to her as he looked around. \u201cLittle Liuyue, there are three batches of students, and that\u2019s the way in which the exams are administered. Even though all the students are in the back mountain, they\u2019re separate. You\u2019re a new student, so you\u2019re in the lowest level. They\u2019re all over there. You just need to head there.\u201dChu Liuyue followed his gaze, then nodded.Chu Xianmin suddenly spoke up. \u201cTeacher Bai Chen, why don\u2019t I show Sister the way? It\u2019s more convenient that way.\u201dBai Chen narrowed his eyes at her and laughed coldly. \u201cYou?\u201dHe still remembered the things that Chu Xianmin and her friends had said earlier! She clearly didn\u2019t harbor any kind thoughts toward Chu Liuyue! He did not feel comfortable with that!The surrounding students looked at Chu Xianmin strangely. Why is Teacher Bai Chen treating her that way? She has always been quite popular with the teachers\u2026Chu Xianmin\u2019s face turned red as she stood awkwardly.Ling Zhu could not bear to watch it and gently said, \u201cMinmin, since she\u2019s your sister, I think it\u2019s best that you show her the way. Head over now. The exam is about to start.\u201dChu Liuyue walked over with a smile. \u201cThank you then, Third Sister.\u201dBai Chen did not say anything on account of Chu Liuyue\u2019s actions. Little Liuyue is clearly not a pushover.Chu Xianmin spaced out for an instant as she looked at Chu Liuyue, who was standing before her.It had only been a while, but Chu Liuyue seemed to look better than she did before. Her skin was fair; her eyes were kind, and her smile seemed to tug at one\u2019s heartstrings. Chu Liuyue was just standing there, but it seemed like she exuded a powerful aura that made her seem more respectable. Her eyes were like the stars in the dark night, able to illuminate everything!The discomfort in Chu Xianmin\u2019s heart grew because she already knew that Chu Liuyue looked much better than she did. She gritted her teeth, repressed all her anger and jealousy, smiled, and led Chu Liuyue forward.A lot of gazes were concentrated on them.Chu Liuyue ignored them all, gathering with the crowd.The students standing there were clearly the youngest ones.They all had silver, circular name tags on the left of their chest. There was a sword engraved on the tag, and there were words in very small font underneath the sword.Chu Liuyue glanced at it, and the words were \u2018four-hundred-and-fifty-three.\u2019The sword was clearly Tian Lu Academy\u2019s logo, and the number was the student\u2019s class.The same tag was on Chu Xianmin\u2019s left chest.Chu Xianmin pointed in a particular direction. \u201cSister, everyone here is taking the warrior exam. That\u2019s the Xuan Master students over there. You can head over now.\u201dChu Liuyue glanced over and saw a dozen or so students standing there, emanating a different aura.They were looking at Chu Liuyue with hostile and judging expressions.Chu Liuyue headed over.When she was three steps away, a young man stepped out and stood in Chu Liuyue\u2019s way. A cold voice rang by her ears. \u201cNot everyone can be a Xuan Master. This is not where you should be, understand?\u201dChu Liuyue curled her lips and looked up. The young man had a black-and-white name tag instead of a silver one.This is the logo of Xuan Masters? Chu Liuyue was a little worried. Why are kids nowadays so eager to be thrown down?Liked it?

Are you saying that it\u2019s Teacher Bai Chen\u2019s mistake?\u201d asked Chu Liuyue lightly.The young man\u2019s expression changed slightly, and he knitted his brows.Bai Chen was one of the top Xuan Master teachers in the academy. He also held a very prominent status. Even he did not dare to offend Bai Chen. If he insisted that it was Bai Chen\u2019s fault, it would not be of any advantage to him.After a while, he sneered. \u201cDo you only know how to use Teacher Bai Chen as your shield? If you have the capability, show it. If not, no one will look up to you, even if you were admitted into the academy.\u201dChu Liuyue replied with a simple \u2018oh\u2019 before saying, \u201cIsn\u2019t that why I\u2019m here for the examination? Brother, you\u2019re blocking my way.\u201dThe young man choked on his words until his face turned red. He wanted to lash out at Chu Liuyue, but he did not know what to say.\u201cSi Yang, come back.\u201d A crisp voice sounded at this moment. Even though the tone was calm, it had a tinge of undeniable authority.Chu Liuyue looked up and realized that the voice was from another young man standing in the crowd.Chu Liuyue raised her brows when she saw that young man\u2019s face clearly. This was because that young man was very good looking.His features were intricate as if a knife had carved them, and he looked extremely handsome. He stood in the middle of the crowd, but all the surrounding people added up were still not as attractive as him.The sun shone brightly, and the trees waved gently. He stood with his hands behind his back like a sword that was about to be unsheathed. He exuded a sharp, fear-inducing aura.The badge on his front was also black and white. He was clearly a Xuan Master.This person\u2026 isn\u2019t simple, thoughtChu Liuyue to herself.When she came over previously, she did not notice this person at all. Logically speaking, she definitely wouldn\u2019t have overlooked the obvious aura coming from his body. Thus, there was only one explanation left\u2014this young man had completely hidden his aura previously.This was sufficient proof that he was definitely not weak.As if he had noticed Chu Liuyue\u2019s gaze, that young man turned around and looked at her.Shock flashed across his eyes.He had seen the Chu family\u2019s Big Missy before, and he remembered that she was a cowardly weakling. Why did she seem to have changed into another person?Once the young man named Si Yang heard this voice, he tightly pressed his lips against each other and said to Chu Liuyue with a lowered voice, \u201cI\u2019ll see your true abilities in the examination later.\u201dChu Liuyue shrugged her shoulders and did not say anything. She was not certain if he was capable enough. However, the name \u2018Si Yang\u2026\u2019 It seemed like he was someone from the Si family, which was one of the top four family clans.\u201cBig Brother.\u201d Si Yang walked over to that person and became much more obedient.Chu Liuyue instantly understood. It\u2019s him. The Si family\u2019s younger generation is filled with talented individuals. The most famous amongst them is the Si family\u2019s Eldest Young Master\u2014Si Ting.He was admitted into Tian Lu Academy more than half a year ago since he was the top scholar of the Xuan Master assessment.Back then, Tian Lu Academy\u2019s teachers had complimented him and said that his potential in this area was extraordinary. They said that he would definitely be one of the best Xuan Masters in the entire Country Yao Chen in a few years\u2019 time.This had caused a big uproar back then. The praises and compliments earned by Si Ting back then were way more than Chu Xianmin, who was the top scholar in the warrior assessment. However, after more than half a year, Chu Xianmin kept improving and became more and more famous. On the other hand, Si Ting\u2019s fame seemed to have died down completely.The crowd then gradually only remembered how outstanding Chu Xianmin was.\u201cDid you study the Eight Water Formation I told you about a few days ago\u201d?\u201d asked Si Ting.Si Yang hurriedly nodded. \u201cOf course! You said that as long as I understand this array formation, I\u2019d have hopes of becoming a stage-two Xuan Master from stage one. Thus, I have been studying it with all my heart these few days.\u201dThe people around him could not help but say, \u201cSi Ting, when you were in seclusion, Si Yang has already successfully become a stage-two Xuan Master.\u201dSi Yang\u2019s face broke into a smile of happiness. \u201cBig Brother, even though I can\u2019t compare to you, I didn\u2019t give up. I have also been training hard.\u201dSi Ting then forced out a smile; it was like a bright moon amidst the clouds. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201dSi Yang suddenly thought of something and inched closer to ask, \u201cBig Brother, did you hear? I think the rewards for this examination are pretty substantial. Especially for the top scholar, it seems\u2014\u201d\u201cEveryone, take your places!\u201d The examiner\u2019s voice boomed before Si Yang could finish his sentence.All the students immediately quietened down at the same time.\u201cWarrior examination in the first zone! Xuan Master in the second! Heavenly doctor in the third! All examinations will proceed at the same time.\u201d As he was speaking, some teachers started leading the students into the various examination zones.Chu Liuyue and the rest were quickly brought to the second zone.Some teachers were already waiting there.Chu Liuyue saw that everyone here were all Xuan Masters, no matter whether it was the teachers or the students.She turned around to look and noticed that the three assessment zones were pretty close to each other. She could even see the other zones. However, the zones were still separated, with a gap in between.\u201cWelcome to the Xuan Master examination,\u201d announced a teacher standing at the front. \u201cActually, this examination is very simple. Do you see the forest in front of you? You\u2019ll succeed if you enter from here, make it through the forest, and claim the flag opposite it.\u201dNot only did the students not relax after he finished his sentence, but they all became nervous.Everyone knew that it was not so simple to pass through the forest. There had to be Xuan formations set inside.\u201cHowever, you must know this. You all need to complete the task individually after you enter the forest. Your results will be made invalid if there\u2019s any alliance.\u201d When that teacher said this, his expression suddenly became stern. \u201cThe teachers will monitor the entire examination. You better hide all the tricks that you\u2019re thinking of. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d The students were all very serious.Actually, these types of rules were very normal. After all, the Xuan Master examination was targeted at an individual\u2019s capabilities.What meaning would there be if they formed an alliance?\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll announce that the Xuan Master examination\u2026 starts now!\u201dThe teacher threw something out from his hands once he finished his sentence.Peng!Bright fireworks exploded in mid-air.\u201cRun!\u201dOnce the fireworks sounded, people ran inside without hesitation.In the blink of an eye, their figures disappeared within the thick forest.\u201cWhy are they rushing? The fastest runner won\u2019t even win in a Xuan Master assessment,\u201d grumbled Si Yang as he looked at Si Ting. \u201cBig Brother, I\u2019ll go first!\u201dIt was better for them to go their separate ways since they could not work together.Si Ting nodded.Very quickly, people left one by one.Only Chu Liuyue and Si Ting were left.Si Ting was about to start walking, but he discovered that Chu Liuyue was faster than him, so he moved three steps to the right and back.He instantly squinted his eyes.Liked it?

The assessment started the moment they entered the woods.Before this, Si Ting had already noticed that the Xuan formation was special and that it would be troublesome to enter from this position.The academy teachers had clearly done this on purpose. Only Xuan Masters with true talent and capabilities could recognize the Xuan formation and choose to enter it from another position.This was also the reason why he did not follow those people in the first instance and chose to stay at the back. He never intended to enter from that entrance. However, he did not expect that someone else noticed this apart from him.This person was precisely Chu Liuyue, who was just admitted into the academy. Thoughts flashed across Si Ting\u2019s mind as he looked at Chu Liuyue calmly again. Is this a coincidence, or\u2026 is she really capable?Chu Liuyue naturally noticed Si Ting\u2019s gaze, but she continued moving back a few steps without hesitation and opened the correct entrance to the forest. She then chose to move forward in another direction.\u201cIf you wait any longer, I\u2019ll be first instead.\u201d Chu Liuyue turned around and smiled at Si Ting.Si Ting was taken aback and momentarily felt that the view surrounding them had lost its color.The young girl in red seemed to have gathered all the light, becoming so dazzling that his eyes hurt. However, her pair of charming, black eyes\u2014which were as shiny as a gem\u2014was even brighter than all of those.Everything around her seemed to blur, and this young girl was the only one in color.Si Ting\u2019s heart tingled as if something had glided past it. When he recovered his senses, Chu Liuyue\u2019s figure had already disappeared into the thick woods; he could only see the leaves waving in the breeze.Si Ting closed his eyes and calmed his beating heart. After hesitating for a while, he moved back a few steps and entered from another direction.The teachers in charge of the examination only recovered from their shock after all the students entered the forest. They looked at each other in complete disbelief.\u201cHow did\u2026 Chu Liuyue go inside just now? Only stage-three Xuan Masters can identify this array formation. Logically speaking, only Si Ting can find the correct way to enter. How did Chu Liuyue do it?\u201dEven though Si Ting had been very quiet the past half a year, a few teachers at the academy knew that he had already become a stage-three Xuan Master a few days ago. He was not even 15 years old this year, but his talent and capabilities were unmatched in the entire Country Yao Chen.He would not even lose to his seniors. It was more than normal for him to spot the trick in the Xuan formation. However\u2026 how did Chu Liuyue do it?\u201cHah, I said that Little Liuyue is a genius, yet you didn\u2019t believe me. When the results come out, remember to glue your eyeballs to your sockets, lest they drop out.\u201d Bai Chen had already walked over. He was not the teacher in charge of the examination, so he could only watch by the side and not participate personally. However, this did not stop him from coming over to watch a good show.\u201cLet me warn you first; I\u2019m first in line if Little Liuyue wants to choose a teacher. None of you can fight with me,\u201d said Bai Chen animatedly. When he saw Chu Liuyue choose to enter from the correct direction, he could not help but exclaim in his heart. After the results come out, these people will definitely not treat Little Liuyue the same way.A teacher nodded. \u201cIt seems like Chu Liuyue does have talent in this area. Even if she can\u2019t compare to Si Ting, she\u2019s still pretty decent.\u201dThey were all Xuan Masters, so they obviously could see her abilities. This was not something they could deny.\u201cCan\u2019t be compared to Si Ting?\u201d retorted Bai Chen as he laughed heartily, \u201cThat might not be the case.\u201dLiked it?

She then chose to progress in a certain direction after some hesitation.This Xuan formation was too simple for her. If she thought hard about it, she could use the most accurate and shortest way to get out. However, she roughly understood what kind of standards she should show to be suitable after what she went through before. Hence, she started walking through the woods slowly.Since she had already entered the academy, the rest did not really matter. As for being the top scholar\u2026 Actually, she really wasn\u2019t very interested in that. She only agreed to join the examination since she wanted to let other people know that she was not easily bullied in order to save some trouble in the future.Her words before were just an act.Chu Liuyue walked in this manner for more than 25 minutes and reached a three-way path.The three paths extended into the forest in different directions.Staring ahead, she could not see anything other than thick greenery.It was time for her to make a choice.Chu Liuyue stood at the three-way path and chose the middle one after some silence.Howling winds could be heard after she stepped on this path. The trees shook intensely while the leaves shook frighteningly as they flew towards Chu Liuyue.Chuo! Chuo!The leaves cut through the wind mercilessly.Cold, murderous intent was enveloping her from all directions. However, Chu Liuyue was still calm and not shocked at all.The next moment, she went on her tiptoes and flew out rapidly, barely avoiding the leaves\u2019 attack.At the same time, two middle-aged men and an elder were sitting around at the other end of the forest. The three of them closed their eyes and meditated, looking as if they had fallen asleep.A silver Xuan formation was shining brightly in the middle of the trio.The different silver lines intersected and overlapped to form a complicated drawing.Suddenly, one of the lines vibrated intensely.One man opened his eyes and shockingly said, \u201cShe already made it this far in such a short amount of time. This Chu Liuyue is really a Xuan Master talent.\u201dThe elder also opened his eyes and smiled as he stroked his beard. \u201cNot bad. Out of so many people, only Si Ting and she went the correct way from the very start. Even though her choices weren\u2019t as good as Si Ting\u2019s, they were still quite outstanding.\u201dThe last person hesitated for a while and shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that the girl isn\u2019t walking with much pattern. I don\u2019t think she learned about Xuan formations. She\u2019s probably just walking based on her instincts. Look, she walked the wrong way.\u201dThe elder squinted his eyes and suddenly asked, \u201cI remember that this Chu Liuyue didn\u2019t have a good time at the Chu family, right? The Chu family wouldn\u2019t have hired a teacher for her.\u201d\u201cElder Sun, are you saying\u2026?\u201dSun Zhongyan looked down at the Xuan formation and saw that the previously intensely-moving line had calmed down.He laughed with deep meaning. \u201cEven though that girl walked the wrong way, she\u2019s not injured at all. Hah, the Chu family really destroyed her talent.\u201dAt this time, a star lit up in the Xuan formation.Both the middle-aged men were shocked.\u201cElder Sun, Si Ting actually found the formation eye.\u201dLiked it?

It\u2019s not a surprise that he can find the formation eye.\u201d Sun Zhongyan was not shocked and waved his hands. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m surprised because he always kept a low profile after he entered the academy. Why did he\u2026?\u201dShowing off his abilities was not Si Ting\u2019s style.\u201cPerhaps he already noticed that a worthy opponent had appeared\u2026\u201d muttered Sun Zhongyan.The other two looked at each other in confusion.\u201cWorthy opponent? Elder Sun, are you being serious? Out of all the students at the academy, who can pose a threat to Si Ting?\u201dOutsiders might not know, but as Xuan Masters, they knew how strong Si Ting\u2019s capabilities and talents were. It was not an exaggeration to say that the seniors from two cohorts before him might not even be his match.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that Si Ting\u2019s talent as a Xuan Master was a rare sight that would only appear once in 100 years?\u201dSun Zhongyan extended his finger and pointed towards the Xuan formation in the middle of the trio. \u201cTake a closer look. Even though Chu Liuyue is walking messily, she has been walking towards a certain direction.\u201dThe two of them lowered their heads in confusion upon hearing his words.From the position she entered the woods, she was walking all the way to\u2026\u201cFormation eye?\u201dAlthough her process was kind of messy, Chu Liuyue was indeed walking towards the formation eye in general.\u201cHow is this possible? She\u2019s not even a stage-one Xuan Master. How can she find the formation eye? She\u2019s probably just walking around based on her intuition.\u201dDisbelief filled the two men\u2019s faces.Sun Zhongyan laughed. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t take the wrong path at the three-way path, she would\u2019ve already reached the formation eye. Perhaps\u2026 she might even be faster than Si Ting.\u201dThis sentence made the two men fall into deep silence.\u201cNo wonder Bai Chen was so emotional just now. It looks like he really did discover a rare talent.\u201dSun Zhongyan looked at the Xuan formation excitedly, filled with curiosity about Chu Liuyue. Either she is doing this because she\u2019s unfamiliar with Xuan formations, or she\u2019s doing it on purpose to hide herself.\u2026Chu Liuyue navigated her way through the woods. At some point, she suddenly stopped and closed her eyes to feel the Xuan formation\u2019s changes.\u201cI\u2019m finally here\u2026\u201d Chu Liuyue muttered and opened her eyes. Si Ting should have already reached the formation eye. I can now proceed on.Firstly, she had no interest and did not plan to reveal all her skills today. However, her results could not be too bad. If not, other people would still label her as a good-for-nothing. She took a deep breath, changed her direction, and walked forward.\u2026Si Ting heaved a sigh of relief in his heart after he arrived at the formation eye and realized that nobody was there. It seemed like no one was ahead of him. Thereafter, he immediately knitted his brows. Why am I afraid that someone will be ahead of me? I\u2019m absolutely confident in myself and have never felt this way before. What is wrong with me today? Is it because of what Chu Liuyue said?Si Ting clenched his fists tighter.In actual fact, he did feel a dangerous aura from Chu Liuyue. He did not know where this feeling came from, but his gut feeling was that Chu Liuyue was not simple.Luckily, he had reached the formation eye first. Since he reached the formation eye, the competition was close to being over.Si Ting waved his palm, and a silver line flew out, forming a weird pattern in mid-air.In the next moment, the silver line vibrated intensely and disappeared.Si Ting looked at the direction the line was at and was about to go forward.Once he moved, he heard footsteps coming from behind.He instinctively turned around to look.A thin, young girl\u2019s figure entered his vision.Chu Liuyue looked up and met with his eyes. She smiled and shrugged her shoulders. \u201cWhat a pity, I\u2019m behind you.\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Completely unharmed. It looks like she did not meet with any trouble at all. However, this is not right.If Chu Liuyue walked the wrong way in the middle, she should have activated the Xuan formation and met with some trouble. However, she looks like she was just casually walking around in her backyard. If she really did not meet with any trouble, she should have been here much earlier. At the very least, she should\u2019ve arrived here around the same time as me. However, she was late by a step.Si Ting wanted to figure something out from Chu Liuyue\u2019s face, but there was only calmness in the depths of her sparkling eyes. He could not glean anything. It seemed like nothing in this world could falter her heart.\u201cYou\u2019re very fast,\u201d said Si Ting simply.Chu Liuyue opened her arms. \u201cStill slower than you by a little.\u201dSi Ting did not say anything else and turned around to walk forward. There is nothing difficult about this competition at all. Chu Liuyue is the only variable. However, it is clear that she doesn\u2019t intend to show off her true abilities. Thus, it won\u2019t be too late to investigate her later.Chu Liuyue also did not say anything else and continued to move forward.After passing through some place, she set her eyes on the disc-like stones beneath her feet. Who would have thought that this is the Xuan formation\u2019s formation eye?This rock that looked more than ordinary actually contained the strongest energy in the entire Xuan formation.She would not be far from the exit once she walked through this place.Si Ting\u2019s figure quickly disappeared, and Chu Liuyue followed closely after.\u2026Si Ting walked out of the woods smoothly without any obstacles and found Sun Zhongyan and the other two teachers waiting for him there.He casually picked up the flag, and a firework rose to the sky from the chessboard at the same time.Peng!The firework exploding meant that the Xuan Master examination\u2019s top scholar had already appeared.\u201cSi Ting, you\u2019ve indeed improved by quite a bit. You only used less than an hour to get out,\u201d praised Sun Zhongyan.Si Ting looked calm and clenched his fists as he bowed. \u201cThank you, Elder Sun, for the compliment. I still have much to learn.\u201dAnother middle-aged man laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re only 15 this year, but you\u2019re already a stage-three Xuan Master. You have a bright future ahead of you. You\u2019re well-deserving of this top position.\u201dSi Ting\u2019s expression changed upon hearing his words as if he wanted to say something, but he swallowed the words in the end. He turned around and looked at the forest.As expected, a pretty face appeared in front of him not long after.It was Chu Liuyue.The time difference between the two reaching the final destination wasn\u2019t very large.Sun Zhongyan and the other two sized Chu Liuyue up seriously.The rumored good-for-nothing young girl was actually so\u2026Chu Liuyue walked over and picked up the second flag.\u2026When the fireworks flew up to the sky, the students still competing behind the mountains were shocked.There was an uproar in the warrior examination zone.\u201cHow did the Xuan Master examination proceed so quickly? The senior sisters said that they would take hours.\u201d\u201cThis should be the top scholar, right?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still quite early\u2026 Who do you think is the top scholar?\u201d\u201cWho else can it be? With Si Ting around, no one else can be at the top.\u201dAt this point, a thick but strong voice sounded in everyone\u2019s ears. \u201cFirst place of the 453rd Xuan Master examination\u2014Si Ting!\u201dThe crowd burst into commotions once the voice faded away.\u201cIt\u2019s really him!\u201d\u201cBased on this efficiency, Si Ting is definitely a stage-three Xuan Master, right? I thought he had died down after not hearing any news about him for more than half a year. I didn\u2019t expect him to get first secretly!\u201d\u201cYeah! I think Chu Xianmin isn\u2019t a match for his talent.\u201d\u201cHow can a warrior and a Xuan Master compete?\u201dA few people whispered amongst themselves and kept glancing at Chu Xianmin.Chu Xianmin tolerated the stares with all her might and pretended that she did not hear them, but her fingernails were already digging deeply into her palms.Si Ting had stolen all the limelight! However, it was okay. Si Ting was part of the Si family after all. He had nothing much to do with her.As long as she destroyed Chu Liuyue today\u2026Peng!The second firework rose into the sky.The crowd was taken aback. Did\u2026 the second place for the Xuan Master examination emerge?Only a short amount of time had passed since the first firework had risen into the sky.\u201cOh my god. Who\u2019s so capable to follow closely behind Si Ting and emerge as second place?\u201dQuestions rose amongst the crowd.The same voice from before boomed. \u201cSecond place of the 453rd Xuan Master examination\u2014Chu Liuyue!\u201dLiked it?

However, how did Chu Liuyue emerge as second place?The initial noisy mountain immediately fell into deadly silence.Chu Xianmin froze, and chills ran down her spine. She seemed to lose control of her own body. Her mind was completely blank, except for that one sentence that kept ringing in her head, which almost made her brain explode.Chu Liuyue! Second place in the Xuan Master examination! How is that possible? How is that even possible?Xuan Masters were very demanding when it came to natural talent. Even she was not lucky enough to become a Xuan Master, let alone that invalid Chu Liuyue.Very quickly, the crowd broke into heated debates.\u201cChu Liuyue in second place? Are they mistaken?\u201d\u201cThis is impossible, no matter how you think of it. Didn\u2019t they say that Chu Liuyue was an invalid and that she lacked in a Yuan meridian?\u201d\u201cThere must be a misunderstanding\u2026 Even if she could pass the examination, how could she come in second?\u201dOne had to know that there were quite a few other outstanding Xuan Master talents attending the same examination apart from Si Ting. All of those people had trained for more than half a year in the academy. How could they lose to Chu Liuyue?Someone hesitantly said, \u201cMaybe\u2026 it\u2019s really true? Perhaps she really has shocking Xuan Master talent. In that case, it would explain Teacher Bai Chen\u2019s previous attitude.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201d screamed Chu Xianmin subconsciously. She only realized that she had lost her composure when everyone looked over. Anxiously, she explained, \u201cI-I mean that Sister really doesn\u2019t have a Yuan meridian. If she\u2019s talented as a Xuan Master, it\u2019s impossible that our family wouldn\u2019t know\u2026 I-I don\u2019t know how she did it\u2026\u201dIn other words, Chu Liuyue\u2019s second place came illegitimately.Someone laughed lightly. \u201cChu Xianmin, you\u2019ve stolen the Crown Prince\u2019s affection. Even if Chu Liuyue had talent, she probably wouldn\u2019t tell you, right?\u201dThis sentence caused the group of people to burst out laughing.The entire Imperial City already knew about what happened at the Crown Prince\u2019s banquet. Chu Xianmin took the initiative to offer herself to attract the Crown Prince\u2019s attention, which eventually led to Chu Liuyue and the Crown Prince\u2019s marriage agreement being dissolved.How was it possible for both parties to have close sisterly bonds with such enmity?Chu Xianmin still had the audacity to act like she cared for Chu Liuyue. Her acting was really good!Chu Xianmin\u2019s face immediately flushed red, and her entire body felt like it was on fire.\u201cChu Xianmin, did you purposely say that because you\u2019re afraid of Chu Liuyue stealing your limelight?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d denied Chu Xianmin immediately, but the mocking stares around her made her feel restless. She clenched her teeth in secret.In the past, everyone knew that the position of Crown Princess belonged to her, and they all licked her boots. They would never dare to say such words. However, her reputation was already ruined now. The status of Crown Princess would land in anyone\u2019s hands except for hers.All these people immediately fell out with her and were very sarcastic towards her.\u201cI-I just feel that it\u2019s quite weird. After all, this Xuan Master examination progressed too quickly. Nobody knows\u2026\u201d\u201cChu Xianmin, are you doubting Elder Sun?\u201d asked Ling Zhu with furrowed brows.Sun Zhongyan held a very respected status in the academy. Even most of the teachers did not dare to challenge him, let alone students.A chill ran down Chu Xianmin\u2019s spine, and she finally lowered her head. \u201cI-I\u2026 don\u2019t dare to\u2026\u201dSeeing her current look, Ling Zhu shook his head silently. He initially thought that Chu Xianmin was very smart, but he did not expect her to be so petty. \u201cThe semi-finals are about to start. The most important thing now is to settle yourself first.\u201dChu Xianmin nodded and took a deep breath.She could only turn the tables around if she was the top scholar for the warrior examination.\u2026In another area behind the mountains, the 451st batch of students was having their examinations.Rong Jin stood there and checked his sword.A few youngsters behind him were filled with enthusiasm.\u201cYour Highness, it seems like you\u2019re bound to be the top scholar for the warrior examination.\u201d\u201cYour Highness should be the strongest in the entire academy, right?\u201dRong Jin laughed lightly and looked into the distance. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t count for much\u2026\u201dPeng!Another firework exploded in the air.Rong Jin took a look at it and squinted his eyes slightly.A young man beside him laughed. \u201cJust now, Si Ting already emerged as first place in the Xuan Master examination. It seems like the top scholar for the warrior examination has also emerged.\u201dAnother young man turned his eyes and laughed sheepishly. \u201cYeah! I think the top scholar for the warrior examination should be Chu Xianmin, right?\u201dRong Jin paused for a while, and his face looked much gentler. \u201cShe is quite talented.\u201dChu Xianmin\u2019s reputation would recover slightly if she emerged as the top scholar; his face would also be saved.A deep, thick voice sounded. \u201cSecond place of the 453rd Xuan Master examination\u2014Chu Liuyue!\u201dRong Jin\u2019s smile froze on his face.Liked it?

The few of them all quietened down instantly as they were afraid of angering Rong Jin. However, they were not the only ones who heard the announcement.The other students waiting for the examination had heard it crystal clear.Some of them started looking at Rong Jin discreetly, wondering if this \u2018Chu Liuyue\u2019 was the famous one in the recent rumors that spread like wildfire.\u201cWho is this Chu Liuyue? Is she a hidden gem suddenly discovered amongst the junior sisters and brothers?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ve never heard of her before. However, it\u2019s not that one\u2026 right?\u201d\u201cOh! I suddenly remembered something. Didn\u2019t that Chu Liuyue say she wanted to be admitted to our academy?

Besides, how is it possible for Chu Liuyue to be admitted to the academy? I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a mistake somewhere.\u201dRong Jin\u2019s face turned even darker when he heard the whispers around him. Yes, he had almost forgotten that the only condition Chu Liuyue raised for dissolving the marriage agreement was to have one chance to be admitted to Tian Lu Academy. No, it\u2019s impossible\u2026\u201cYour Highness!\u201d A shout broke the anxious silence. It was from the young man who had gone to find out more information.Upon seeing him, Rong Jin stepped forward and asked quickly, \u201cWhat exactly is going on over there?\u201d Even he did not notice that his voice had an unconcealable nervousness.\u201cYour Highness, the second place for the Xuan Master examination on the other side is indeed Chu Liuyue,\u201d said the young man while gasping for air.Rong Jin\u2019s heart sank, but he was still harboring a last bit of hope. \u201cIs there someone with this name in that batch of students?\u201dIn a difficult position, the young man paused for a while and avoided Rong Jin\u2019s gaze. \u201cY-yes, there\u2019s someone called Chu Liuyue\u2026\u201dRong Jin closed his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief secretly.There is indeed someone with the same name. Exactly, how could that Chu Liuyue be a Xuan Master?\u201cY-your Highness\u2026\u201d explained the young man with a shaky voice as he knew that Rong Jin had misunderstood his words, \u201cthis Chu Liuyue is that one\u2026\u201dRong Jin was taken aback. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dThe young man pulled a long face. \u201cChu Liuyue was admitted into the academy today. She participated in the Xuan Master examination as a new student. She placed second in the examination. All the students and teachers on the other end are currently going crazy over the news. It\u2019s only a matter of time before the people here will find out about it.\u201dThis news would spread to everyone in less than an hour.Not only did the Chu Liuyue\u2014who everyone could bully in the past\u2014successfully enter Tian Lu Academy, but she had also come in second place during the mid-semester Xuan Master examination on the day of her admission.This would definitely rile up the entire Imperial City.Rong Jin did not recover his senses for quite some time. Then, he grabbed the young man by his collar and hollered, \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? How can someone without a Yuan meridian be a Xuan Master?\u201d\u201cY-your Highness, why would I dare to lie to you? Elder Sun Zhongyan said it himself.

How unlucky must he be to meet with such a thing?Just after he dissolved the marriage agreement, the other party became an attractive genius, and she was even a Xuan Master.An outstanding Xuan Master talent was even more precious and capable than a regular warrior talent.Chu Liuyue\u2019s life would really be flipped upside down if she had truly used her own capabilities to place second in the examination. From now on, everyone would want to ride on her coattails.Rong Jin had actually given up on such a rare Xuan Master talent that had been his fianc\u00e9e and chose Chu Xianmin instead.

At the very least, there would be no ignorant people that dared to cause trouble for her from now on.\u201cAre you Chu Liuyue?\u201dChu Liuyue turned around and saw a kind old man sizing her up.Behind him were two other middle-aged men.A mini Xuan formation floated beside them.She realized that these three men were the Xuan Masters controlling the Xuan formation in the forest.She bent her knees and bowed. \u201cGreetings, teachers.\u201d\u201cElder Sun is one of our academy\u2019s five most esteemed elders,\u201d reminded one of the middle-aged men.Chu Liuyue immediately changed her phrasing. \u201cGreetings, Elder Sun.\u201dSun Zhongyan waved his hands and chuckled. \u201cThis isn\u2019t important. It\u2019s normal for Liuyue not to know about this since it\u2019s her first time here. I didn\u2019t expect the academy to be able to accept such a talent. It was no wonder that kid\u2014Bai Chen\u2014likes you so much. You\u2026 are very capable!\u201d\u2018That kid\u2026\u2019 It seems like this elder is pretty senior here. She did not really hear about the five elders before, but it was obvious that they held a prominent status. Chu Liuyue thought this in her heart, but her facial expression did not change. She said, in neither an overbearing nor a humble manner, \u201cThank you, Elder Sun, for the compliment.\u201dSun Zhongyan liked her even more after hearing her words.Even though she was young, she was very calm and collected. Most of the students that came in first or second during an examination would have a hard time hiding their proud expressions even though they spoke in a humble manner. However, judging from Chu Liuyue\u2019s calm eyes, it seemed like she really did not care about it.It was either she did not know what her ranking meant, or she did not even care about the difficulty of the examination.\u201cI\u2019m not praising you. You do have the talent to become a Xuan Master. You would definitely be very different if your talent had been unearthed and cultivated earlier.\u201dWhat is wrong with that Chu family? How can they delay such a rare talent? If Chu Liuyue did not suggest entering Tian Lu Academy herself, her talent would\u2019ve been buried for the rest of her life.The two middle-aged men beside him looked at each other and saw the other party\u2019s shocked look.Elder Sun looked kind and gentle, but he had very high expectations; it was rare for him to admire and praise students. Even though Chu Liuyue\u2019s performance was decent, Elder Sun\u2019s comments were a little too much.Chu Liuyue smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re really thinking too highly of me. I\u2019m already very happy to be able to enter the academy and learn.\u201dSun Zhongyan stroked his beard and smiled at Si Ting. \u201cSi Ting, you need to work a lot harder from now on.\u201dSi Ting tightly pressed his lips against each other and looked down slightly. \u201cI will remember your teachings.\u201d It seems like Elder Sun saw something in her. There\u2019s an 80% chance that Chu Liuyue hid her true abilities during the examination.\u201cSince you\u2019ve finished the examination, come take a look at the Xuan formation,\u201d said Elder Sun as he pointed at the floating silver Xuan formation.Si Ting and Chu Liuyue readily agreed and followed him over.Sun Zhongyan personally arranged this Xuan formation, and it was very detailed and complicated. One would definitely benefit a lot if they could personally examine it and learn from it.After an hour roughly passed, hurried footsteps could be heard from the woods.Chu Liuyue looked over and smiled.The person coming was actually Si Yang. The current him had his hair in a mess, and his clothes were stained with blood. It was obvious that he had a hard time inside. He looked very different from his initial arrogant expression.His gaze swept across the row of flags and discovered that there were two empty spots. This meant that only two people were ahead of him.I\u2019m third! A smile finally appeared on his face when he thought of this as he hurried over and took one of the flags. Even though the journey here was very difficult, it was worth it to get such a result.He then looked up.In the woods, one could not hear sounds that came from outside the Xuan formation. Thus, he did not know who had come in first place and second place.He looked up and saw a familiar, bulky figure. As expected, it\u2019s Si Ting. He directed his gaze to the side, and his entire person froze when he saw the pretty face.\u201cCongratulations.\u201d Chu Liuyue clapped her hands and smiled happily. \u201cThird place.\u201dSi Yang was completely dazed as he asked instinctively, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dChu Liuyue blinked. \u201cBecause\u2026 I came in second place.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s such a pity. You said we would battle it out on the examination grounds, but you didn\u2019t catch up with me after I waited for you for so long. Thus, I could only make a move first.\u201d Chu Liuyue shrugged her shoulders. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be so\u2026 slow.\u201dLiked it?

Too slow? I came in third!Such an achievement was clearly something to be proud of, but he was mocked when it came to Chu Liuyue! He couldn\u2019t even refute her because she had come in second.Even if he didn\u2019t believe it, Chu Liuyue wouldn\u2019t have the guts to lie in the presence of Elder Sun and the others.After comparing their achievements, he felt his face burn as he recalled what he had said earlier. Si Yang clung onto his last hope as he struggled and asked, \u201cYou? When did you get out?\u201dIf Chu Liuyue had been slightly faster than him, then\u2026\u201cThe girl came within less than half an hour of Si Ting, and you arrived one hour after her.\u201d Sun Zhongyan smiled. Si Yang was a good kid in all other aspects, but he could get a little too proud and full of self-righteousness.By using Chu Liuyue, he could knock down the boy\u2019s ego by a notch.Indeed, after Si Yang heard Elder Sun\u2019s words, all his lucky thoughts were dispelled instantly. He lowered his head dejectedly. If there was a crack in the ground, he would have crawled into it immediately!He looked like a joke now because he had been the one to provoke Chu Liuyue earlier.Chu Liuyue said, \u201cIf you have any regrets because we didn\u2019t get to spar today, let\u2019s arrange to do it some other day.\u201dHer words seemed to rouse him, and he looked at her carefully. Upon closer examination, he was amazed to see that there wasn\u2019t even a single scratch on Chu Liuyue. He had suffered during the test, but Chu Liuyue didn\u2019t seem to be affected at all!He gritted his teeth and turned away. \u201cNo need! I admit that you are better than me in today\u2019s examination!\u201d He wished he was anywhere but here when he said that. He felt disgraced.\u201cLiuyue is indeed talented in this area. You are going to be classmates in the future. It\u2019s always good to communicate more and help each other out,\u201d said Sun Zhongyan.Si Ting finally drew his gaze away from the Xuan formation. \u201cI will remember Elder Sun\u2019s advice diligently.\u201dSun Zhongyan nodded.Soon, the announcement for third place sounded.This time, Si Yang\u2019s name was announced.Initially, Si Yang had been looking forward to hearing his name announced like this. However, he wasn\u2019t happy at all now that it had actually happened. He even felt an inexplicable sense of shame when he thought about being next to Chu Liuyue.She had taken second place without saying a word. So, what was the big deal about him coming in third place?He walked and stood behind Si Ting in embarrassment, not saying a word. He couldn\u2019t help himself from glancing at Chu Liuyue occasionally.He couldn\u2019t fathom why Chu Liuyue\u2014who was being mocked by everyone in the Imperial City as a loser\u2014could be so powerful.When she looked at him, he quickly withdrew his gaze again as though nothing had happened. His ears were getting redder and redder, revealing his guilty conscience and nervousness.After this happened several times, Chu Liuyue finally couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud. \u201cIf you have anything to ask me, feel free to do so.\u201dThis time, it wasn\u2019t only his ears that reddened. Si Yang\u2019s face and neck also reddened.Actually, he didn\u2019t really have much to say to Chu Liuyue. However, he was simply too curious about her. Finally, he couldn\u2019t help himself from awkwardly asking, \u201cEhm\u2026 you\u2026 So many people have called you a loser. Have you been faking it?\u201dChu Liuyue\u2019s eyebrows rose slightly.A few people turned towards them once he asked that. In reality, this question bugged them too.Chu Liuyue shook her head and gave a crisp answer. \u201cNo.\u201dSi Ting leaned forward to hear more, but Chu Liuyue didn\u2019t elaborate further. She obviously didn\u2019t see the need to explain.He was a little disappointed, yet he knew that this was someone else\u2019s secret. He was in no position to ask more. So, he muttered, \u201cI told you. If you\u2019ve been faking it, you could have just come in first place. I hear that this year\u2019s first place will get to meet the ambassadors from the Tianling Dynasty!\u201dChu Liuyue suddenly froze, and her pupils shrank.Liked it?

Oh, right. You used to have such a miserable life in the Chu family. It is only normal that you don\u2019t know about the existence of different levels.\u201d Si Yang finally gained some internal balance. At least he knew more than Chu Liuyue in this aspect. As the descendant of the Si family, all he heard was actually a few rumors. However, this was more than what any ordinary person could hear.Chu Liuyue curled her fingers, seemingly unperturbed by his words. She smiled. \u201cWhat? Is that so-called Tianling Dynasty that powerful?\u201d\u201cMore than powerful! The whole Country Yao Chen has to look up to them. That\u2026\u201d Si Yang got more and more excited as he spoke.Then, Si Ting gave him a look. \u201cSi Yang.\u201dSi Yang suddenly quieted down and coughed. \u201c\u2026 I know, I know. I shouldn\u2019t speak about such things.\u201dChu Liuyue was silent for a moment before she asked, \u201cEarlier, you said that whoever comes in first gets to see the ambassadors?\u201dSi Yang cautiously glanced at Si Ting. When the latter didn\u2019t object, he nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Although we don\u2019t have the chance to go to the Tianling Dynasty, it\u2019s a great opportunity to be able to see their ambassadors too!\u201d Saying that, he looked at Chu Liuyue and shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s futile for you to ask. The assessment is over. You came in second, so there\u2019s no chance for you.\u201dChu Liuyue lowered her eyes.Si Ting suddenly asked, \u201cYou seem to be very\u2026 concerned about this?\u201d As a bystander, he saw everything clearly. Chu Liuyue seemed to be different after hearing the news.When she came in second place during the assessment earlier, she was extremely calm, as if she didn\u2019t take these things to heart at all. It was like she was just doing it casually.But just now, Chu Liuyue had asked a question casually. However, the fact that she had asked about it meant she was concerned about this.\u201cFrom what Si Yang said, this is a rare opportunity. If I didn\u2019t know about it, that\u2019s fine. But now that I know, I naturally want to see too.\u201d Chu Liuyue looked honest, with regret in her eyes. \u201cUnfortunately\u2026\u201d I was reborn in Country Yao Chen, which is a great distance from the Tianling Dynasty.She originally thought that it would take many years before she could go back and exact revenge on those people. However, she never expected that people from the Tianling Dynasty would come themselves!Although she wasn\u2019t sure who the ambassadors were, she would be able to find out some information at the very least. However, it was exceptionally rare for the Tianling Dynasty to send ambassadors to its subsidiary countries. At least, she had never sent anyone to Country Yao Chen during the years she was in power.What is it this time? Chu Liuyue withdrew her gaze and looked at the Xuan formation again like she was trying to comprehend it. In reality, her mind was still thinking about the ambassadors from the Tianling Dynasty.She wondered how long she would have to wait for any relevant news about the Tianling Dynasty again if she missed this opportunity. Country Yao Chen was but an unremarkable country among the Tianling Dynasty\u2019s dozens of affiliated countries. This was a rare opportunity.Her current strength certainly wasn\u2019t enough to help her exact her revenge, but\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to obtain some information! A full year had now passed since the day she \u2018died.\u2019 She wanted to know what happened after her death.Chu Liuyue was torn as though two vile creatures were fighting inside her.\u201cBrother, you must definitely tell me what it is like to meet the ambassadors!\u201d Si Yang leaned closer to Si Ting with envy and yearning written all over his face. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that all of them there are top-notch powerhouses\u2026 I wish I had the chance to go there to take a look in this life!\u201dSi Ting smiled slightly. \u201cYour chance will come if you work hard.\u201dSi Yang\u2019s eyes lit up. He nodded vigorously, but his face fell in an instant. \u201cUgh, I wonder when that will be!\u201dIt took decades for Country Yao Chen to have such an opportunity. It was rare indeed.Chu Liuyue suddenly spoke up. \u201cElder Sun, I would like to ask you a question.\u201dSun Zhongyan nodded. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cI wonder if the academy has a rule that a person can only participate in one assessment?\u201dSun Zhongyan shook his head. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be such a rule. However, there are no such precedents previously because the assessments are divided into three categories\u2014warriors, Xuan Masters, and heavenly doctors. Each student has their own specialized discipline, so they basically only take part in the one they study.\u201dHe looked at the young girl before him. Suddenly, he could vaguely guess what she was thinking. \u201cYou\u2026 wish to take part in the other categories\u2019 assessments?\u201dChu Liuyue pursed her lips and smiled, her eyes brilliant. \u201cElder Sun is wise.\u201dAnother teacher spoke out and expressed his objection. \u201cHow can you do that? You\u2019ve already participated in the assessment for Xuan Masters.\u201dChu Liuyue was calm. \u201cTeacher, you seem to have forgotten that I just enrolled today. I\u2026 haven\u2019t decided which discipline I am going to specialize in yet. This means that I\u2019m eligible for the other assessments, aren\u2019t I?\u201dHer words shut everyone up.Oh, right! Chu Liuyue had entered the academy with three passes in all three assessment categories. Therefore, she could actually take the examination for any category before she decided which one to specialize in.Another teacher couldn\u2019t stop himself from commenting. \u201cB-But, you have the most talent as a Xuan Master, and you have already come in second place. You won\u2019t be able to get a better result, even if you partake in the other assessments!\u201dChu Liuyue, however, was unmoved. \u201cI won\u2019t know until I\u2019ve tried.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d Si Yang was stunned for quite a while before he realized what Chu Liuyue was planning to do. He rushed to her side and shouted, \u201cI admit that you are gifted as a Xuan Master, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll have an advantage in the warrior assessment or the heavenly doctor assessment! You\u2019re going to get yourself killed. Coming in second place is good enough. Why can\u2019t you just think about it carefully? If you get beaten half to death, let\u2019s see what pride you\u2019ll have when you come back!\u201dChu Liuyue looked at him with some surprise. Is this brat worried about me getting bullied?Si Yang blushed and raised his voice when she saw his embarrassment. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare think otherwise! You\u2019re one of us now that everyone knows you\u2019re the second-best Xuan Master! If you embarrass yourself, people will laugh at us too!\u201dPutting the heavenly doctors aside, the warrior students and Xuan Master students had been secretly competing against each other.Si Yang had already recognized Chu Liuyue as one of his own. Now that he saw her like this, he naturally objected.Chu Liuyue patted his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be back after taking first place.\u201dLiked it?

Minmin, you\u2019ll definitely come in first, won\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! I heard you had another breakthrough a while back. We\u2019ll get to see it all this time.\u201dAt the warrior assessment area, the process was halfway through. They had arrived at the final stage. This was the part with the most students, almost 300 of them. However, only two of them would be able to overcome the numerous hurdles and make it through the finals.Chu Xianmin was definitely one of them.Chu XIanmin\u2019s mood finally improved after listening to the several people rallying around her. She replied modestly, \u201cI\u2019m not as good as you say. Besides, Gu Mingfeng is also very strong. I may not be able to get first place in the assessment this time.\u201dGu Mingfeng was the other finalist. He, too, came from one of the four great family clans.\u201cHe is just a commoner. How can he compare to you?\u201d A girl smirked. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for his little bit of talent, why would the Gu family care about him?\u201dIn Country Yao Chen, people still valued the hierarchy between a true-born descendant and a commoner, as well as seniority.Chu Xianmin looked at Gu Mingfeng\u2014who was standing in the distance\u2014and realized that he was staring at her too.Gu Mingfeng was actually quite good-looking. His features were exquisite as if they had been carefully carved. However, his amber eyes, which always seemed a bit gloomy, chilled one\u2019s heart.She immediately showed her disapproval and pulled at her friend. \u201cStrength is of the essence. Yan\u2019er, don\u2019t speak of such things in the future.\u201dThe girl named Yan\u2019er didn\u2019t even notice Gu Mingfeng was watching them. She stuck her tongue out. \u201cSo what? I am the Second Missy of the Lu family; I dare him to find trouble with me.\u201dAlthough the Lu family couldn\u2019t be compared to the Gu family, she was, after all, the first daughter of her family!Chu Xianmin glanced at Gu Mingfeng, but he had averted his gaze and didn\u2019t seem to hear them.Gu Mingfeng definitely heard them. She had intentionally wanted to do him a favor. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t seem to be that easy to bait.In her heart, Chu Xianmin actually despised this kind of commoner\u2019s son, so she simply stopped thinking about it.Lu Feiyan tugged at her sleeve and whispered to her. \u201cMinmin, Chu Liuyue came in second place for the Xuan Master assessment. No matter what, you mustn\u2019t lose to her. You must come in first place!\u201dChu Xianmin stiffened. She was annoyed that Lu Feiyan had been ignorant enough to touch her sore spot. She nodded reluctantly. \u201cI know what to do.\u201dAt this moment, a firework exploded in the distant sky.\u201cFirst place for warrior assessment, Rong Jin from 451st batch!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Crown Prince! The first place is really him!\u201dLu Feiyan\u2019s eyes shone as she shook Chu Xianmin\u2019s arm with joy. \u201cMinmin, His Highness is really as strong as people say he is! I heard that their batch is very competitive. It is awesome that he came in first!\u201dChu Xianmin laughed unconcernedly. \u201cBrother Jin had it at his fingertips.\u201dLu Feiyan was both envious and jealous of the intimacy between Chu Xianmin and the Crown Prince. \u201cHey, Minmin. His Highness sees you in a different light. Will he be present for your upcoming assessment?\u201dEveryone surrounding her directed their attention to Chu Xianmin.Chu Xianmin felt slightly embarrassed. If it was before, the Crown Prince would definitely be present. Alas, his attitude towards her was much colder ever since that banquet so he probably wouldn\u2019t come.She forced a smile on her face. \u201cThe assessment over there has just ended. Brother Jin should still be busy and won\u2019t\u2026\u201dBefore she had finished, she heard a familiar voice coming from afar. \u201cMinmin, why did you say that? This is your finals, so I\u2019ll definitely come.\u201dChu Xianmin\u2019s heart skipped a beat, and she immediately looked up.The Crown Prince, Rong Jin, was headed her way while dressed in purple brocade.Chu Xianmin was filled with joy and apprehension at the same time. He must also know that Chu Liuyue has come in second place for the Xuan Master assessment. Why is here to see me instead of being angry?Rong Jin came before Chu Xianmin. His expression was one of rare tenderness. He seemed to be emphasizing something with each word when he said, \u201cYou\u2019re the best.

As a result, she had entered Tian Lu Academy and even came in second place for the Xuan Master assessment. That was equivalent to slapping his face hard!At a time like this, she must take first place in the warrior assessment to regain her pride and prove that she was truly better than Chu Liuyue.Not only did this concern her, but it also concerned the Crown Prince! That was why he came under such circumstances. He wanted to show everyone that he had nothing to lose by choosing Chu Xianmin over Chu Liuyue.Chu Xianmin knew this was her chance and promised him. \u201cBrother Jin, rest assured that I will do my best.\u201dAs long as she performed well today, the Crown Prince would have an out, and everything after that would be easy.Rong Jin nodded with satisfaction. What he liked most about Chu Xianmin was her intelligence; she knew the appropriate action for every occasion.The teacher-in-charge of the assessment shouted, \u201cChu Xianmin, Gu Mingfeng, are you done with your preparations? The finals are about to begin!\u201dChu Xianmin and Gu Mingfeng heard that, and they walked towards the open space in the middle.The other students had already formed a circle, waiting for the finals to begin.The two of them naturally had the talent and strength to be able to stand out among hundreds of students.\u201cThe final will determine who takes first place! The battle has no time limit and will only end when one side concedes! However, absolutely no killing is allowed during the battle! Otherwise, you will be disqualified from the competition!\u201d The teacher supervising the exam raised his voice as he looked at both of them. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d\u201cWe will remember it in our hearts.\u201d\u201cThe match\u2026 starts now!\u201d With the teacher\u2019s announcement, the atmosphere at the arena immediately became serious.\u201cPlease share your experience with me,\u201d said Chu Xianmin politely. As her words trailed off, she was the one who quickly moved her feet towards Gu Mingfeng with a swift attack!A sharp glint flashed in Gu Mingfeng\u2019s eyes!The two were engaged in a melee battle.\u201cThese two are about to advance to the fourth stage as warriors. It should be some time before the winner emerges.\u201dSome teachers from the academy were among the audience. They whispered while watching the battle on the field.\u201cChu Xianmin has been playing it safe. I think she is the stronger one. She should win.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard that Gu Mingfeng has been diligently cultivating recently. It\u2019s still too early to tell who will be the winner.\u201dChu Xianmin and Gu Mingfeng did not have the same teacher; naturally, they would be compared at such times.A teacher beamed. \u201cActually, I\u2019d like to head over to Xuan Masters\u2019 assessment to watch\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, Yu. Normally, there\u2019s nothing wrong with you except that you like to go where the crowd goes. The Xuan Master assessment is nothing more than a mystic formation. You won\u2019t understand it even if you went. I believe you probably want to see Chu Liuyue, right?\u201dThere was derision.One who had been unmasked must simply admit it.\u201cAren\u2019t you curious? Everyone says she\u2019s a loser, but she became a Xuan Master in the blink of an eye. Did the whole Chu family go blind and never realize she was a genius throughout all these years?\u201d\u201cYu, let\u2019s stay out of their family business.\u201dAt this point, everyone looked at each other. They said nothing more and quickly changed the topic to the match between Chu Xianmin and Gu Mingfeng.An hour passed, and the two were still fighting.Chu Xianmin began to panic. She realized that Gu Mingfeng was much more formidable than she expected. If they continued like this, she might not get first place!She stole a quick glance at Rong Jin, who was among the audience. Indeed, he looked sullen.Chu Xianmin gritted her teeth. This mustn\u2019t go on! I must finish it quickly.She took a deep breath, transferred all her force, channeled it into her longsword, and thrust the longsword straight ahead.Liked it?

She loosened her grip on the sword, lowered herself, and stepped aside to avoid his sword.Gu Mingfeng initially thought she would attack again, but he didn\u2019t expect her to abandon her sword and lose her pivot all of a sudden.The longsword in his hand, which had been filled with the force, fell short! He wobbled.Chu Xianmin had circled to his side by this time. In her hand, something flashed with a biting, cold light.\u2026 A sharp dagger!By the time Gu Mingfeng reacted, the dagger was already in front of him, no more than half an arm\u2019s length from his neck!He subconsciously tried to turn his longsword around, but it was too late!In his hurry, Gu Mingfeng had to retreat quickly! However, he hadn\u2019t been able to stand firm just now, and this caused him to lose his center of gravity directly.His gaze turned icy when he looked at Chu Xianmin. How dare she use such a devious move against me!The anger burned inside him. He was about to move, but he suddenly thought of something. His expression changed, and he hesitated. No, not now.Chu Xianmin had already arrived before his eyes at precisely this moment.Gu Mingfeng secretly removed half of the force from his leg and kicked Chu Xianmin\u2019s wrist!Bang!He actually kicked her dagger away.However, Chu Xianmin was prepared and immediately used the momentum to lift her leg. Her kick landed right in the middle of Gu Mingfeng\u2019s chest.With a muffled sound, his whole body flew back, somersaulted, and hit the ground hard. It left a long trail on the ground.The crowd outside the arena quieted down.An assessment teacher shouted, \u201cGu Mingfeng, out of bounds! Chu Xianmin wins the battle!\u201dAs soon as she heard that, Chu Xianmin finally set the boulder of worry in her heart down.Everyone exchanged looks with each other.\u201cThis\u2026 whatever Chu Xianmin did just now couldn\u2019t be intentional, right?\u201d\u201cI think so. The two of them are on par when it comes to strength. How could she have lost her grip on her sword so easily? If it weren\u2019t for that, Gu Mingfeng wouldn\u2019t have missed.\u201d\u201cYou guys aren\u2019t jealous that Chu Xianmin won first place, are you? It\u2019s not like we don\u2019t know about her talent and strength. She didn\u2019t have to resort to these tactics! The teachers also haven\u2019t said anything!\u201d\u201cBut it just looked a little off\u2026\u201dOne teacher laughed.\u201cIt is a competition after all. Sometimes, it\u2019s not a bad idea to be smart.\u201dThere were other teachers who showed their disapproval, but they didn\u2019t say anything in the end. All of them could clearly see that Chu Xianmin had pushed the envelope. Although her actions weren\u2019t very good, it wasn\u2019t a big mistake.They would encounter much more dangerous situations than this when they fought in the future.Besides, Gu Mingfeng didn\u2019t seem to have any intention of fighting for first place\u2026Hearing the teacher say all this, the questioning voices in the crowd gradually subsided.Chu Xianmin walked up to Rong Jin and said with relief, \u201cFortunately, I didn\u2019t disappoint Brother Jin.Rong Jin smiled. \u201cYour strength has increased by so much more than before. It won\u2019t take you long to become a stage-four warrior.\u201d The process didn\u2019t matter. What he wanted was the result. \u201cI promised you before that I would give you a reward as long as you could pull off a victory.\u201dRong Jin was in a good mood. He was beginning to look at Chu Xianmin much more favorably again.The position of main consort was no longer available to her, but the position of side consort was still good.\u201cWarrior assessment for the 453rd batch, first place goes to Chu\u2014\u201dThe assessment teacher couldn\u2019t finish the announcement. He was interrupted by a clear female voice.\u201cWait.\u201dEveryone looked toward a certain direction in unison, and they were all taken aback.\u201cChu Liuyue, what are you doing here?\u201d The teacher was initially frustrated by the interruption. But as soon as he saw Chu Liuyue, his tone became gentler.Chu Liuyue smiled and replied, \u201cI would like to participate in the warrior assessment.\u201dLiked it?

You want to join the warrior assessment?\u201d That teacher was shocked. \u201cDidn\u2019t you already participate in the Xuan Master assessment?\u201dChu Liuyue explained, \u201cTeacher, it\u2019s my first day at school today, and I haven\u2019t chosen which aspect I want to specialize in. So, I should be given a chance to join the warrior assessment, right?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d The teacher paused. \u201cIt\u2019s not wrong to say that, b-but\u2026 there has never been such a case before.\u201dEven if a person had a lot of talent in different aspects, they would normally just choose one to specialize in. For example, someone that could become a Xuan Master would usually spend all their efforts on Xuan formations, not warrior cultivation.All humans had a limit to their energy. If they wanted both ends of the stick, they would usually end up failing to obtain both.Besides, Chu Liuyue lacked a Yuan meridian, so it would be best for her to become a Xuan Master. What made her foolish enough to join the warrior assessment?\u201cThe academy doesn\u2019t have a rule that states that each student can only join one assessment. Since the girl wants to try, let her have a go.\u201dThat teacher looked up and was stunned momentarily before he respectfully greeted the speaker. \u201cGreetings, Elder Sun.\u201dChu Liuyue also turned around and nodded in gratitude. Originally, she planned to come on her own, but she did not expect Sun Zhongyan to follow her. It seemed like he was standing up for her.Since Sun Zhongyan had already spoken, outsiders could not stop her anymore.After hesitating for a while, that teacher said with much difficulty, \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible for you to join the assessment, but\u2026 the assessment here has already ended\u2014the finals are over. If you want to join the assessment, you need an opponent to determine who wins and loses. However, there isn\u2019t anyone suitable at this moment.\u201dChu Liuyue raised her chin. \u201cIsn\u2019t there someone suitable there?\u201d\u201cChu Xianmin?\u201d With disbelief, that teacher dazedly said, \u201cYou want to go against the top warrior? Are you serious?\u201dIs Chu Liuyue a fool?She lacks a Yuan meridian and probably might not even be a match for a stage-one warrior. How can she possibly compare with Chu Xianmin, who is about to reach warrior stage four? Only failure will await her if she goes on to battle.Chu Liuyue paused for a while and smiled abruptly. \u201cI\u2019m serious, because\u2026 I came here to be the top scholar!\u201d\u2026After the finals, the warrior assessment zone had already calmed down; many people were preparing to leave. However, they did not expect Chu Liuyue to come over to participate in the assessment and even directly challenge Chu Xianmin.The originally quiet crowd burst into heated discussions.\u201cIs this true? Chu Liuyue wants to go against Chu Xianmin?\u201d\u201cHah, did I hear it wrongly? She wants to be the top scholar?\u201d\u201cMy god\u2026 This Chu Liuyue doesn\u2019t usually talk, but she shocks everyone once she does! Does she think she hasn\u2019t proved herself enough today?\u201d\u201cA battle between the sisters while the Crown Prince is at the side. How exciting!\u201dIf it weren\u2019t for so many people watching her at the side, Chu Xianmin would burst out in laughter. Chu Liuyue actually wants to vie for first place with me? I can\u2019t do anything to Chu Liuyue regarding anything about Xuan Masters, but she is just asking for trouble by participating in a warrior assessment.\u201cSister, do you really want to challenge me?\u201d Chu Xianmin had a belly full of jealousy and hatred yet to be unleashed, but who would have thought that Chu Liuyue would offer herself?Chu Liuyue raised her brows. \u201cYou won\u2019t fight me?\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, I\u2019ll definitely obey. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be \u2018careful\u2019 and won\u2019t hurt you, Sister.\u201d As she talked, she smiled at that teacher. \u201cTeacher, please allow for this match to take place.\u201dSince both of them had agreed, others would not interfere with their decision.\u201cOkay! Then, we\u2019ll add one more match. However, I\u2019ll repeat this once more: the match stops when you score sufficient points.\u201dChu Liuyue did not say anything.Rong Jin\u2019s expression was complicated as he stared at the girl not too far away from him. The once inferior girl has now become a Xuan Master talent\u2026 Did she purposely come here to prove something to me?However, Chu Liuyue didn\u2019t even look in his direction after waiting some time; she acted as if he did not even exist.An unknown fire grew in Rong Jin\u2019s heart. He turned to look at Chu Xianmin and gently said, \u201cBe careful, don\u2019t let me worry about you. I\u2019ll organize a celebratory feast for you when you get first place!\u201dLiked it?

The Crown Prince did like her, but he rarely used such a gentle tone with her, especially when in front of so many people. He even sounded like he was pampering her.Does this not prove that the Crown Prince is determined to marry me? Chu Xianmin was filled with elation and delight as she smiled even more sweetly. \u201cThen, I\u2019ll thank you first, Brother Jin.\u201dRong Jin nodded, but the corner of his eyes quickly swept past the nearby Chu Liuyue. However, she was already walking towards the arena. She did not care about what happened between them or his actions.Rong Jin\u2019s thin lips pressed against each other tightly, and the unknown fire burned even more fiercely in his heart. Didn\u2019t Chu Liuyue previously say that she secretly had a crush on me? Why does she have such an attitude now?In the past, he only had hatred towards her. The marriage agreement between the two of them was like a gigantic mountain crushing his heart, which utterly frustrated him.However, he felt like something was wrong now that she didn\u2019t bother him nor take another look at him anymore after the marriage agreement had been dissolved. He felt\u2026 uncomfortable.He did not even know why he would feel this way himself, but this feeling would not go away and kept annoying him.Rong Jin quickly retracted his gaze and looked at Chu Xianmin. Suddenly, he felt very bored.But Chu Xianmin did not notice Rong Jin\u2019s changes and turned around to head for the arena.The two sisters were against each other.The atmosphere immediately started to tense up.\u201cSister, I haven\u2019t congratulated you. I didn\u2019t know you had such amazing talent as a Xuan Master. If our family finds out about this, they will be over the moon.\u201d Chu Xianmin smiled as if she was genuinely happy for her.The crowd looked at each other with confusion and doubts in their eyes.What does that mean? The Chu family doesn\u2019t know that Chu Liuyue has Xuan Master talent? Then how did she start learning how to be a Xuan Master and attain second place in the assessment when faced with such outstanding students?\u201cDon\u2019t worry; they\u2019ll find out about this very soon. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be happy, but it seems like you aren\u2019t, Third Sister.\u201d Chu Liuyue was very straightforward and had no intention of faking their \u2018sisterhood.\u2019Chu Xianmin could not maintain her facade. \u201cSister, you\u2019re seeing yourself as an outsider by saying this. It\u2019s a good thing for the entire Chu family if you can become a Xuan Master, so why wouldn\u2019t I be happy? The more talented and stronger you are, the happier I will be as your sister. For this warrior assessment, I still need you to kindly enlighten me.\u201dThe crowd choked with laughter.\u201cChu Liuyue lacks a Yuan meridian and can\u2019t even be counted as a warrior. She is bound to lose this match. How could she possibly have the ability to \u2018enlighten\u2019 Chu Xianmin?\u201d\u201cHahaha, it seems like this pair of sisters\u2019 relationship has thoroughly fallen apart.\u201dChu Liuyue\u2019s lips curved up slightly. \u201cSince you\u2019ve said so, then\u2026 I won\u2019t go easy on you.\u201d Before Chu Liuyue finished her sentence, she suddenly vanished into thin air.Chu Xianmin was stunned, and her heart skipped a beat. Why is Chu Liuyue so fast?A dangerous aura suddenly attacked from behind her, and Chu Xianmin instinctively turned around and drew her sword.A red figure flashed across her eyes, and Chu Xianmin swiftly brandished her sword towards the front and stabbed harshly.The sharp sword instantly cut through the person\u2019s chest.Before Chu Xianmin could be happy about it, she realized that the other party was not injured. The other party\u2019s figure had even slowly disappeared.Chu Xianmin immediately felt that something was amiss. That wasn\u2019t even Chu Liuyue. It was her shadow!\u201cYou\u2019re too slow.\u201d A cold voice sounded.Chu Xianmin looked up and saw Chu Liuyue already standing three steps away and looking at her nonchalantly. Chu Liuyue gazed at her as if she were looking at a tiny ant.Chu Liuyue\u2019s gaze made Chu Xianmin feel inferior for some reason.\u201cWhat happened just now?\u201dThe spectators watching the battle also did not expect Chu Xianmin\u2019s attack to miss. They looked at each other in confusion.The few teachers\u2019 expressions changed slightly. When they looked at each other, they saw the shock in the other party\u2019s eyes.\u201cHow can Chu Liuyue be so fast? It looks like she\u2019s not weaker than a stage-three warrior.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not even a warrior. How can she have such ability?\u201dAt this point, Bai Chen could not help but raise his brows in delight. \u201cHehe, why don\u2019t you think about it carefully? What\u2019s so surprising about Little Liuyue having such ability if she could pass the warrior examination?\u201dThe few teachers were stunned when they heard his words.That was right!Chu Liuyue had passed all three categories in the entrance examination. This proved that her own capabilities were comparable to that of a stage-three warrior.Seeing their expressions, Bai Chen unleashed the anger in his heart. \u201cDid you think that I purposely made it easy for Little Liuyue to enter our academy?\u201dThe few teachers kept quiet for a while before shaking their heads since they knew Bai Chen was someone with integrity and honesty. He definitely wouldn\u2019t do such a thing.\u201cHehe, let me tell you that an exciting show awaits at the back!\u201dThis group of people doesn\u2019t know how to think on their feet. They will start regretting it when they see that girl\u2019s true potential.\u2026No! It should not be like this! Chu Xianmin clenched her teeth tightly. Chu Liuyue is just a loser, and I\u2019m about to become a stage-four warrior. How can I not be Chu Liuyue\u2019s match? T-that\u2026 was just a mistake on my part previously.Chu Xianmin did not say a word as she circulated the force in her body and infused it into her longsword.Weng! Weng!The sharp sword started vibrating and made frightening sounds.\u201cGo!\u201d Chu Xianmin stood on her toes and swiftly attacked Chu Liuyue.Chu Liuyue looked up.The sharp sword was coming right for her.Her hair flew along with the wind.\u201cChu Liuyue won\u2019t be able to avoid it this time\u2026\u201d said someone softly in the crowd.However, the next second, the crowd shockingly discovered that Chu Liuyue did not retreat but had even advanced.Chu Liuyue took a step forward and planned to face the attack head-on.The most important thing was that she had no weapons on her. Was she going to fight Chu Xianmin with her bare hands? She was bound to lose if that were the case.Chu Xianmin\u2019s longsword was only half an arm away from Chu Liuyue\u2019s neck.Chu Xianmin suddenly had an evil thought as she stared at the face getting increasingly closer. Her face really is getting prettier. If I can ruin it once and for all, Chu Liuyue will not be so arrogant in the future.When Chu Xianmin thought of this, her wrist tilted slightly, and the sword\u2019s blade moved an inch away, heading straight for Chu Liuyue\u2019s face.Murderous intent flashed across Chu Liuyue\u2019s eyes. She spun around and bent her left leg slightly as her right leg flew up and went straight for Chu Xianmin.Bang!Chu Liuyue directly kicked Chu Xianmin\u2019s wrist with her foot.Chu Xianmin felt excruciating pain as she yelled out loud.Before she could react, Chu Liuyue had already rapidly closed in on her. Chu Liuyue turned around, and her left leg went flying out.This time, she kicked Chu Xianmin\u2019s face directly.A silver light flashed across, and fresh, red blood gushed out. Chu Xianmin\u2019s face instantly had several deep cuts.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her hand felt sticky.That excruciating pain made her heart tremble.Chu Liuyue actually ruined my face! Anger erupted from the bottom of her heart, and Chu Xianmin threw away the last bit of her rationality.She quickly looked at the bottom of Chu Liuyue\u2019s foot. As expected, a few very sharp blades were hidden underneath.Chu Liuyue used this to cut her face just now.There was an 80% chance of her face being scarred.While covering her face in a hurry, she questioned with a shaking voice, \u201cChu Liuyue! What hatred do you have towards me for you to harm me like this?\u201dChu Liuyue calmly glanced at the sword she dropped on the floor. \u201cWeren\u2019t you planning to disfigure me first?\u201dChu Xianmin was instantly stumped and felt guilty.Actually, it all happened in a single moment. When she decided to leave a scar on Chu Liuyue\u2019s face, she only shifted her wrist slightly. If one did not observe the battle closely, they would not have noticed that something was wrong. However, Chu Liuyue had accurately guessed her intentions.\u201cNo, I-I didn\u2019t! W-We\u2019re only dueling, so why would I do such a thing? You! It\u2019s you! You wanted to do this much earlier, right? If not, why would you react so quickly?\u201dChu Liuyue\u2019s lips curved up slightly as she mocked Chu Xianmin mercilessly. \u201cI\u2019m fast because I\u2019m stronger than you. You should\u2019ve known this from the start, right?\u201dChu Xianmin\u2019s anger was stuck in her chest; she felt so uncomfortable that she was about to explode. She had no way of retorting Chu Liuyue\u2019s words.Chu Liuyue was indeed very fast when the two of them first exchanged blows. However, how could Chu Xianmin be calm with her possibly disfigured face?Murderous intentions rose in Chu Xianmin\u2019s heart. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d Chu Xianmin screamed and rushed towards Chu Liuyue. Even though her face was harmed, she still had her abilities\u2014which exploded at the highest speed with her current agitation.Even the Heaven and Earth Force in the surroundings seemed to have converged towards her body.In a short span of time, Chu Xianmin\u2019s aura became even stronger. \u201cStars and Sky Fall!\u201dThe next moment, red force quickly gathered in her hands and formed burning fireballs. She harshly flung the red balls out afterward.The balls burned brightly in the air and headed straight for Chu Liuyue.The strong force was hurled towards the front at a high temperature, leaving the ground with long scorch marks.\u201cShe truly is about to become a stage-four warrior. She can actually forcefully expand her warrior skills now. It seems like she\u2019ll still win this battle in the end\u2026\u201d said a teacher softly.All of them had seen Chu Xianmin\u2019s talent for themselves. If not, she would not have come in first place during the warrior assessment.Bai Chen sneered. \u201cNot to mention the fact that she isn\u2019t a true stage-four warrior yet, she might not even be Little Liuyue\u2019s match even if she were.\u201dThis sentence immediately attracted the teachers\u2019 attention.\u201cBai Chen, why do you think so highly of Chu Liuyue? You need to know that it\u2019s a huge jump from warrior stage-three to warrior stage-four. An ordinary person can\u2019t casually overcome this gap.\u201d\u201cConsidering Chu Liuyue\u2019s previous reaction and moves, she should\u2019ve undergone some simple training. Her talent as a warrior is proven since she can execute such moves, but it\u2019s a pity that she has a lacking Yuan Meridian and is helpless in front of such warrior skills.\u201dBai Chen could not be bothered to speak to them. Even if Chu Liuyue really can\u2019t become a true warrior in the future, the capabilities she has are more than enough to go against a mere Chu Xianmin.The scene of the entrance examination appeared in his brain once more. He could still vividly remember that moment he felt his life being threatened when he fought against Chu Liuyue.In the arena, Chu Liuyue did not appear anxious in front of Chu Xianmin\u2019s unleashed powers\u2014which were in an uncontrolled state. She even raised her brows and laughed instead. \u201cSince you told me to enlighten you, watch closely. This is how you use a sword!\u201dAs Chu Liuyue said that, she rapidly stepped forward, lifted the sword with her foot, and quickly caught the handle.\u201cHow fast!\u201d The crowd gasped.Chu Liuyue\u2019s action just now was even faster than her previous moves.Compared to her, Chu Xianmin seemed like she had purposely slowed down her movements.Chu Liuyue spread her legs as she got into a stance and bent her knees slightly. Her muscles tensed up and gathered all the energy to be unleashed.She tightly held the sword in her hand and suddenly raised her arm when the fireball of force was about to reach her.The sword was high in the air, and the cold light was harsh.Shua!Chu Liuyue cleaved down without hesitation. This move was executed at the speed of lightning.The crowd did not even see Chu Liuyue\u2019s actions clearly, and only saw the gleam of a blurred silver shadow.They then heard a frightening sound of air being pierced through.The next moment, that silver shadow cut right through the middle of the red fireball.This all happened in just a moment\u2019s worth of time.To the crowd, Chu Liuyue\u2019s sword cleave did not have any effect at all. That frightening fireball of force was still flying towards her rapidly.Chu Xianmin sneered. \u201cWith your abilities, you must be dreaming if you think you can stop my attack.\u201dA loser who can\u2019t even be considered a warrior might not even know what warrior skills are. Chu Liuyue will be handicapped with this one move, if not dead.However, Chu Xianmin\u2019s smile froze the next moment because that fireball had actually stopped one arm away from Chu Liuyue.After a momentary silence, it suddenly exploded.Hong!The fireball exploded into countless sparks. The energy within the ball also quickly dissipated.When the scattered sparks were about to land on her body, Chu Liuyue raised the sword once again, tilted her wrist, and sliced the front.The strong sword power immediately erected an invisible shield in front of her, blocking all of the aftereffects.The countless sparks fell around Chu Liuyue like the beautiful stars in the night sky. However, her body was clean and did not even get dirtied by a single speck of dust. Her pair of dark eyes seemed to shine even brighter.Everyone was stunned! If they did not see it with their own eyes, they would never believe that Chu Liuyue could actually block Chu Xianmin\u2019s warrior skills with a sword.Chu Xianmin was shocked beyond words as her eyes widened; she had even forgotten about the excruciating pain on her face. She looked at Chu Liuyue in a daze, and her mind was blank.Chu Liuyue suddenly threw the sword towards Chu Xianmin the next moment.The harsh murderous intentions came from all directions, wrapping around Chu Xianmin tightly.The indescribable, deep fear made Chu Xianmin\u2019s body go soft, and she could not retaliate.Choo!The longsword flew past the top of Chu Xianmin\u2019s head and instantly cut off a part of her scalp.\u201cAh!\u201d Chu Xianmin screamed and instantly collapsed onto the floor. I-I\u2026 almost died just now!\u201cYour reaction speed is too slow! You\u2019re too slow, and your moves are too clumsy! It seems like you\u2019re not very good yourself.\u201d A harsh and cold voice sounded from above Chu Xianmin\u2019s head.Chu Xianmin trembled as she raised her head and saw that the weak girl she had trampled on so many times before had completely changed her look.It was as if Chu Liuyue had superior powers that no one could ever obtain, which humbled people and made them admire her from their hearts without any tinge of defiance.\u201cThird Sister, are you pleased with this enlightenment?\u201dLiked it?

Her lips moved slightly, but she could not say a word.The sword had previously flown right across the top of her head. If it had deviated slightly, she would have died.Everyone had their mouths agape.Since when did Chu Liuyue become this strong?\u201cHer sword had force in it!\u201d muttered a teacher in shock.If not, there would be no other explanation for why the sword had such tremendous strength.Chu Xianmin\u2019s abilities were nearing that of a stage-four warrior. An average person definitely couldn\u2019t push her to this stage.\u201cThis means that\u2026 She has a Yuan meridian!\u201dAll the other teachers looked at each other in confusion, and their eyes filled with doubt.\u201cNo wonder\u2026\u201d Bai Chen let out a deep breath.When he first exchanged blows with Chu Liuyue, he already felt that something was amiss. In hindsight, this seemed to be the only explanation.\u201cIt seems like this girl has many tricks up her sleeve\u2026\u201d Sun Zhongyan was dazed for a moment before he smiled. He looked at Chu Liuyue with shock and admiration.Even he did not feel that anything was wrong. If Chu Liuyue had not battled Chu Xianmin, nobody would have known when the public would find out about this secret.\u201cWhat happened? I thought Chu Liuyue didn\u2019t have a Yuan meridian.\u201d The crowd\u2019s shock could not be appeased. \u201cIf Chu Liuyue is a warrior, why did nobody notice her?\u201dIf Chu Liuyue showed a trace of her force movement before, the others would definitely notice it. Chu Xianmin would also not be so arrogant and lose this badly. Sun Zhongyan looked at Chu Liuyue calmly and stroked his beard with a smile before saying, \u201cThat\u2019s because she\u2019s still not a warrior.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d The teachers were stunned when they heard his words.\u201cThe Heaven and Earth Force her body has absorbed is plentiful, but she did not take that final step to become a true warrior. That\u2019s why no one noticed her.\u201dLing Zhu sighed softly and looked at Chu Liuyue with a completely different gaze than before. She is so young, but she already knows how to keep a low profile. Her mindset is already much stronger than that of other people her age.\u201cHowever, Director had once checked for her before, and she really did not have a Yuan meridian. Why\u2026?\u201d\u201cI heard that Chu Liuyue bought numerous herbs from Zhen Bao Pavillion after she sold the Crown Prince\u2019s hunting ground earlier on. This piece of news spread like wildfire back then. Could it be that was when she recovered her Yuan meridian?\u201d\u201cHowever, there are only a few heavenly doctors in the entire Country Yao Chen. Who has such capabilities?\u201dIn their eyes, recovering a Yuan meridian was an impossible task. However, Chu Liuyue\u2014who stood in front of their eyes\u2014was living proof. They had to believe it.\u2026\u201cSurrender or continue?\u201d asked Chu Liuyue nonchalantly in the arena as she looked down at Chu Xianmin from above.Continue? Once Chu Xianmin heard that, her body started shaking violently. The excruciating pain on her face and head kept reminding her of what happened previously. If she continued\u2026 her entire body would probably be destroyed by Chu Liuyue.However, she would be indignant until death if she surrendered to Chu Liuyue.Chu Xianmin raised her head slowly and looked at Chu Liuyue standing in front of her. The young girl\u2014who was once trampled on, played with, and bullied by her\u2014currently stared straight down at her from a high position.Chu Xianmin never imagined that such a day would come.If she surrendered, Chu Liuyue would get first place. She would easily win everything.Two strong opposing forces in Chu Xianmin\u2019s body were tearing her apart crazily, making it hard for her to decide.\u201cThen we\u2019ll continue,\u201d said Chu Liuyue. She did not have that much patience to wait for Chu Xianmin\u2019s answer, and she raised her right hand.\u201cI surrender! I surrender!\u201d yelled Chu Xianmin out loud as if she was agitated greatly. At the same time, she swiftly moved backward and stared at Chu Liuyue\u2019s right hand in horror as if she were avoiding a humongous beast.Chu Liuyue shifted the loose strands of her hair behind her ear with her right hand and chuckled. \u201cWhy are you nervous? I said I only wanted to come in first place during the assessment.\u201dAs she was talking, she looked at the supervising teacher at the side. \u201cTeacher, can we announce the results now?\u201dThe teacher was dazed when he saw everything happening in front of him. He only recovered his senses when Chu Liuyue spoke to him. Even if he had never thought of this scenario in the past, the truth was right before his eyes.He gulped some saliva down with much difficulty before saying, \u201cChu Liuyue, first place in the 453rd Warrior Assessment.\u201dChu Liuyue came in first place!The teacher\u2019s voice immediately spread far and wide, echoing throughout the mountains. It entered everyone\u2019s ears crystal clear.Chu Xianmin\u2019s face immediately darkened, and her ears drooped down instinctively. It\u2019s over\u2026\u2026\u201cThe people in the Chu family are such fools! They will immediately regret this once they hear this news,\u201d said a teacher while shaking his head.Everyone saw the battle between Chu Liuyue and Chu Xianmin clearly. They all knew who the stronger one was.Chu Liuyue had also attained second place in the Xuan Master assessment. Only a few people in the entire Country Yao Chen had such Xuan Master and warrior talent at the same time.This type of person would be lovingly doted on in any household, but how did the Chu family treat Chu Liuyue all these years?They allowed her to be bullied and insulted by anybody and everybody.Bai Chen chuckled and touched his chin. \u201cPfft, I\u2019m afraid someone else will be the last to regret.\u201dWhen the teachers beside him heard that, they instantly looked in a certain direction as if they understood each other\u2019s thoughts.They did not forget that another key person was here\u2014Crown Prince Rong Jin!Of these two sisters, one was the fianc\u00e9e he abandoned, while the other was the new love he doted on.One sister got rid of her \u2018good-for-nothing\u2019 name with one move and became the talented one that everyone admired.The other sister\u2019s reputation was ruined, and she had even lost to the other party in the competition she was most confident in.Who would not regret when they realized they treated the dirt as treasure and had thrown the real treasure away?Rong Jin stood rooted to the ground, and his entire person became as stiff as an ice statue, exuding a cold and harsh aura. His face was expressionless, just like the frozen floor\u2014hard and stiff.Only the hands in his sleeves were tightly clenched together as if he was about to crush something to death.This entire battle didn\u2019t even take half an hour. The conversation he previously had with Chu Xianmin still seemed to be echoing throughout the mountains, but Chu Liuyue had already given them a tight slap.On the arena, Chu Xianmin remained collapsed on the floor, letting her mucus and tears flow on their own as her face was badly mangled. A part of her scalp was even sliced off, making her look extremely ugly and disgusting.However, Chu Liuyue was completely unharmed and looked just like the sun high up in the clouds as she stared down at them with her lips curved up into a gentle smile. She looked very beautiful.The people around Rong Jin were all as quiet as mice. They did not dare move an inch, nor did they dare to look at his current expression.However, Rong Jin could still feel countless gazes landing on him.Mockery, teasing, and contempt\u2014Chu Liuyue was the cause of all of this. However, the culprit was already descending from the arena and did not even look in his direction.He swiftly went forward, blocked Chu Liuyue\u2019s path as if he could not control himself, and questioned her harshly. \u201cDid you lie to me on purpose? You were acting on the day of the banquet. You purposely wanted to dissolve the marriage agreement between us, right?\u201dChu Liuyue blinked. \u201cCrown Prince, how could you say that? You were the one who wanted to dissolve the marriage agreement.\u201dRong Jin was instantly stumped since he was indeed the one who made the request. However, how was he supposed to know\u2026\u201cI think you can save your efforts in preparing a celebratory banquet for my third sister.\u201d Chu Liuyue\u2019s smile became even more mesmerizing as she genuinely said, \u201cHowever, I still need to give my blessings to both of you. I hope both of you will grow old together and build a wonderful family.\u201dRong Jin\u2019s anger was stuck right in his throat.Liked it?

Rong Jin was not a fool and understood everything after seeing Chu Liuyue\u2019s present attitude. She wanted to dissolve the marriage agreement a long time ago. If not, why would she even sell the hunting ground on her own and trigger the entire series of events?Rong Jin looked at the smiling young girl in front of him, and her eyes were sparkling brightly as if she long knew this day would come.\u201cIf Your Highness doesn\u2019t have anything else to say, I\u2019ll take my leave,\u201d said Chu Liuyue as she walked by him. There were no signs of reminiscence or regret from the start till the end.Rong Jin\u2019s heart was harshly pricked as if he had suddenly lost something important at this moment. Rong Jin clenched his fists tightly and relied on his last bit of rationality to prevent himself from rushing over to hold her back.What position did he have now?Everyone was taking him as a laughingstock.\u201cBrother Jin\u2026 Brother Jin\u2026 Please help me\u2026 I\u2019m in pain. Brother Jin\u2026\u201d Chu Xianmin miserably cried while she stared at Rong Jin as though she was looking at her last straw of life. She wanted to walk towards Rong Jin, but her body was paralyzed. She laid on the floor uncontrollably and could not use any of her body\u2019s strength.She suddenly fell on the floor again after struggling for a while, and her body was dirtied with dust and dirt. Together with her messy hair, frightening wounds, and bloodstains, she looked as creepy as a scary ghost.Chu Xianmin currently no longer looked like that talented young girl\u2014who was once proud and highly sought after.Many people looked at her with contempt.\u201cPfft, Chu Xianmin has completely lost the match.\u201d\u201cHehe, didn\u2019t you like her a lot in the past? Why are\u2026?\u201d\u201cPui! I don\u2019t dare to like such a pompous woman. Her reputation is completely ruined. She will never have good days like before, no matter whether it\u2019s in the academy or the entire Imperial City.\u201d\u201cIf not, how could she attract the Crown Prince? There are too many women in the Imperial City who want to suck up to the Crown Prince. However, Chu Xianmin is the most\u2014and only\u2014successful one. The Crown Prince\u2019s taste is pretty feisty\u2026 Hahaha!\u201d\u201cHey, do you think the Crown Prince will still marry Chu Xianmin after today?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if the Crown Prince will marry her. I only know that Chu Liuyue will immediately become the most sought after distinguished woman in the entire Imperial City after today. Now that she has regained her freedom after dissolving her marriage agreement with the Crown Princ, the Chu family\u2019s gate will definitely be struck until it\u2019s broken. Besides, she\u2019s originally a very pretty girl. She is also talented, both as a warrior and a Xuan Master.\u201dThe whispers started spreading.Rong Jin\u2019s body suddenly became cold. At the same time, he felt as if lava was rolling around his chest, burning him. It was like he would explode in the next second. Rong Jin glared at Chu Xianmin with a deadly gaze filled with hatred.\u201cSomeone! Bring her away and let her rest!\u201d commanded Rong Jin while grinding his teeth.Someone immediately stepped forward from behind Rong Jin and carried Chu Xianmin away.When Chu Xianmin passed by Rong Jin, Chu Xianmin stretched out her hand, seeking some comfort from him. \u201cBrother Jin, Bro\u2014\u201dRong Jin glared at her warningly. \u201cYou should rest and recuperate during this period. Don\u2019t come out if you have nothing to do. Do you understand?\u201dRong Jin had never directed such a cold and nonchalant gaze at Chu Xianmin. He looked at her as if she was useless trash.Chu Xianmin started shaking and retracted her hand fearfully, suppressing the horror and indignance in her heart. \u201cY-Yes\u2026\u201d\u201cLittle Liuyue, way to go! I said you were a rare talent, yet those old fellows didn\u2019t believe me!\u201d On the other end, Bai Chen had already rushed to Chu Liuyue\u2019s side and excitedly raised his chin toward that group of teachers. \u201cDo you have anything else to say about her results? Second in the Xuan Master assessment and first in the warrior assessment!\u201dThe teachers looked at each other and laughed helplessly.Capabilities would forever be the most powerful evidence.If they did not see it for themselves, they would never believe that the once good-for-nothing Chu Liuyue\u2014who was mocked by the entire Imperial City\u2014could actually have such skills.Sun Zhongyan smiled and shook his head. \u201cOkay, Bai Chen. From now on, nobody will suspect that you purposely made it easy for Liuyue to get in. On the other hand, people will praise you for not making the academy lose a true talent.\u201dThinking of his previous stony attitude towards Chu Liuyue, Bai Chen immediately felt guilty and scratched his head. \u201cPfft, that was nothing much! The main point is that Little Liuyue is outstanding herself!\u201dThe way many students gazed at Chu Liuyue now had already changed from their initial contempt to their current curiosity and admiration.\u201cTeacher Bai Chen, tell us what exactly happened at the entrance examination!\u201d shouted a student suddenly.This sentence garnered several screams from the crowd.\u201cYeah! Tell us!\u201d\u201cHow exactly did she pass all three of the examination\u2019s assessments?\u201dBai Chen playfully scolded, \u201cAre you guys trying to start a revolt? I\u2019m a teacher, not a storyteller! The incident is already spreading like wildfire in public. Go and find out for yourself!\u201dThe crowd burst into laughter.\u2026Chu Xianmin only felt that this laughter was very harsh to her ears.At a point in time, she was in the limelight, and she was the one that everyone envied.However, Chu Liuyue had completely replaced her now. Chu Liuyue had even attained more than what Chu Xianmin originally had.And her?Now, she could only be carried away from the arena and leave doggedly, miserably, and pitifully.She closed her eyes with much hatred and almost crushed her silver teeth. Chu Liuyue, it\u2019s not over between us!Rong Jin was also in an equally awkward position as Chu Xianmin. He stood rooted to the ground and felt even worse when he heard the bustling laughter.\u201cI still have something to do in the palace. I\u2019ll take my leave first.\u201d Rong Jin turned around to bow to Sun Zhongyan and the rest of the teachers before leaving at lightning speed. He did not turn back even once.\u2026\u201cLiuyue, it\u2019s your first day in the academy. Since you passed all three of the entrance examination\u2019s assessments, you can choose whichever one you want to specialize in. Since you\u2019ve participated in two assessments, I think you should have a deeper understanding of those two aspects. Have you thought about which you would like to specialize in?\u201d asked Sun Zhongyan.Once he said this, the crowd instantly quietened down and looked at Chu Liuyue curiously.Bai Chen gulped down a mouthful of saliva nervously. He originally thought that Chu Liuyue had the most talent as a Xuan Master. However, he now understood that Chu Liuyue\u2019s Yuan meridian was completely fine after the earlier battle and that she also had outstanding cultivation talent as a warrior.She had no obstacles in front of her. A bright future laid ahead of her, no matter which path she chose.Chu Liuyue smiled. \u201cI choose\u2026 Xuan Master!\u201d\u2026The Chu family estate.In the living room, all the seats were filled up. All the distinguished members of the Chu family were gathered in one place.Suffocating silence filled the spacious living room.Everyone sat quietly, and their expressions were strange. They came here upon hearing the news, so they knew why they had gathered here.Finally, Third Elder stroked his beard and said, \u201cThe news has spread throughout the entire Imperial City, and many people have sent numerous gifts over\u2026 According to the rules, we should celebrate Liuyue\u2019s entry into Tian Lu Academy\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to celebrate?\u201d First Elder looked terrible and slammed the table harshly. \u201cWe first need to punish her for lying and hiding the truth from her elders when she comes back!\u201dLiked it?

    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66: ReclaimingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euThird Elder Chu laughed in response. He asked with interest, \u201cFirst Elder, you must be joking. Liuyue\u2019s acceptance to Tian Lu Academy has brought the whole Chu family honor. Why do you want to punish her instead?\u201dEveryone in the hall fell into a more awkward silence.If it were any other child of the Chu family who had gotten into Tian Lu Academy, they would definitely be exhilarated. However, this person happened to be Chu Liuyue\u2014the person the entire Chu family had bullied for over a decade!The better she was now, the more embarrassing it was for the Chu family! She became living proof, showing everyone how blind the Chu family had been all these years.Since the whole Imperial City had learned of this matter, the family wondered how many people would be laughing behind their backs, even if they came to offer their congratulations!How many people were waiting to see them make a laughingstock of themselves!?First Elder was irate. \u201cThat\u2019s all the more reason to discipline her! Clearly nothing was wrong with her! She\u2019s even quite talented, yet she pretended to be a good-for-nothing and deceived the entire Chu family. Now that she\u2019s basking in the limelight, where does that leave us?\u201dChu Yan suppressed the anger in his heart and seriously said, \u201cFirst Elder is right! I didn\u2019t expect Chu Liuyue to have such deep thoughts, but I absolutely believe that she did this on purpose today!\u201dHe had been out dealing with things today, but he immediately rushed back when he heard the news. At the moment, all he could feel was extreme hatred and resentment toward Chu Liuyue.Not only did she get herself into Tian Lu Academy, but she even participated in the mid-term examinations! She came in second place for the Xuan Master examination while taking first place for the warrior examination! Chu Liuyue had completely surpassed Minmin.How could Chu Yan accept this?\u201cIf all the children in the Chu family follow her example and behave like her, the Chu family won\u2019t exist in the future.\u201dWhen everyone in the hall heard what Chu Yan said, they exchanged looks among themselves. Each of them wore a different expression.Chu Yan seemed to speak for the entire Chu family. In reality, everyone knew he was taking this opportunity to exact his own private wrongs.He was extremely proud of his daughter, Chu Xianmin, for being the family clan\u2019s most outstanding daughter. However, Chu Liuyue had outshone and defeated Chu Xianmin. How could he wholeheartedly accept it when he might even be plotting to kill Chu Liuyue?The Third Elder sipped his tea leisurely. \u201cOutsiders might not know whether there\u2019s an actual problem with Liuyue\u2019s body. However, as members of the Chu family, we should know better. At that time, His Majesty asked several people to diagnose her, and all of them said she had a defective Yuan meridian. When our family clan tested her a few years ago, we also detected no force in her body. First Elder, you say she has deceived us all, then are you suspecting that all those people lied as well?\u201dThe First Elder turned pale. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that!\u201d He couldn\u2019t afford to mess with those people, who were of prestigious status. If word got out, he wouldn\u2019t have an easy time dealing with them.Chu Yan refused to give up. He snorted coldly and said, \u201cOf course, those guys can\u2019t be wrong with their diagnoses. Chu Liuyue is the only one at fault! According to Third Elder, she previously had a defective Yuan meridian. So, how did she manage to turn herself into a genius in the blink of an eye? She never said anything about what happened in between! If she hadn\u2019t gone to Tian Lu Academy and taken the exams today, there\u2019s no telling when this would have been discovered!\u201dThe crowd exchanged looks among themselves. In fact, this was what confused them the most. What really happened to Chu Liuyue\u2019s body for her to experience such a huge and abrupt change?\u201cCould it be\u2026 those herbs she bought some time ago?\u201d someone whispered with uncertainty.\u201cAfter the herbs were delivered, Chu Liuyue handled everything by herself. Are you trying to tell me that she repaired her own Yuan meridian?\u201d First Elder was furious, but he only laughed at the absurdity!During that period of time, he had sent his men to monitor Chu Liuyue and her father in secret. However, his men never saw anyone enter their courtyard. Nobody could repair her Yuan meridian in the whole Country Yao Chen, so how could she manage to do that on her own?Either fate decided to give her a chance, or someone more powerful was secretly helping her! Whatever the reason behind her change, he was going to dig it up!\u201cThe family head is still in seclusion, so I will handle all of the Chu family\u2019s matters. When Chu Liuyue returns, immediately bring her here for interrogation!\u201d First Elder\u2019s eyes swept across the great hall, looking at everyone with authority, and finally landed on the Third Elder.\u201cThe family head entrusted the whole family to me. Naturally, I have to be responsible for everyone. Chu Yin, you have been opposing me all this while. What exactly are your intentions?\u201dThe Third Elder sneered inwardly. He thought of how shameless this old thing had gotten! He is indeed a lawless man without his master!Chu Yin relaxed, leaned back in his chair, and said, \u201cFirst Elder, you misunderstood me. I am not opposing you. I just feel that there aren\u2019t many from the Chu family\u2019s younger generation that can show their skills. We finally have Chu Liuyue\u2014a top genius warrior and Xuan Master, who has been favored by Tian Lu Academy\u2019s teacher\u2014and her future is limitless.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that she is the Chu family\u2019s future face. There should be a limit to the questioning, interrogation, or punishment, even if First Elder wishes to do so. Of course, considering how wise and devoted you are to the Chu family, you will definitely not do anything excessive. Right?\u201dFirst Elder was choked beyond words. Finally, he swung his sleeves furiously. \u201cThat goes without saying!\u201dAt this moment, a pageboy suddenly burst through the door in a flurry. \u201cFirst Elder! Big Missy has returned!\u201dFirst Elder reprimanded him furiously. \u201cShe\u2019s already back! Why are you panicking?\u201d He looked up, towards the outside. \u201cWhere is she? Tell her to come see me at once!\u201dThe pageboy threw himself onto his knees, looking flustered and helpless as he stammered, \u201cI-It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2026 Big Missy is back, b-but she\u2019s standing outside the front door. She refuses to come in!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d First elder frowned. \u201cWhat is she trying to do now? She won\u2019t come in, so we have to go invite her in?\u201dAll these years, Chu Liuyue had been a coward in the Chu family. Though she had just been accepted into Tian Lu Academy, she became so arrogant!He gave a low grunt and looked at the crowd. \u201cHow is this not an issue? Look at her! She\u2019s already putting on airs!\u201dThe crowd in the hall had mixed reactions.Third Elder asked, \u201cWhat did she say?\u201dThe pageboy wiped the sweat from his brow. \u201cMissy s-said\u2026 she wants you to go out and see her.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s rebelling!\u201d First Elder slapped the table when he heard that. \u201cWho does she think she is?\u201dThird Elder stroked his beard and chuckled. \u201cFirst Elder, Chu Liuyue is not a nobody, but a rare genius seen only once a century. She has the most outstanding presence among the Chu family\u2019s entire younger generation. You said that the family is your priority earlier. Are you\u2026 not willing to go?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d First Elder was irate. \u201cFine! I\u2019d like to see what tricks she has up her sleeves!\u201d\u2026Chu Liuyue stood in front of the Chu family estate\u2019s main gates with her hands clasped behind her back. Her eyes were calm and indifferent as she stared at the two big golden characters \u2018Chu Family\u2019 on the gate.She had suffered much injustice and many grievances here.

A crowd had also gathered not far away.It was afternoon. News of Chu Liuyue\u2019s acceptance into Tian Lu Academy had spread throughout the whole Imperial City like wildfire. Many had rushed here to join in the fun.Even though they didn\u2019t dare to approach the Chu family\u2019s gate, the formed crowd had blocked most of the streets in and out of the family estate. It was a mess.First Elder had been seething with anger. However, it quickly turned into resentment when he saw the crowd. \u201cWhy are you still standing there? Get in here now!\u201d He shouted at Chu Liuyue, obviously in a bad mood.Chu Liuyue stood rooted on the spot. Did she want the whole city to witness their family\u2019s embarrassment?Chu Liuyue tucked the loose hair behind her ear and asked with a knowing smile, \u201cFirst Elder, I was useless in the past. When you ordered me around, I had nothing to say. However, I\u2019ve been admitted to Tian Lu Academy now. Why are you still being unkind to me? Am I that detestable to you?\u201dFirst Elder choked and whirled around. \u201cIt\u2019s naturally a good thing that you\u2019ve been accepted into Tian Lu Academy. However, if you\u2019re going to use this to your advantage, then I won\u2019t allow it!\u201dHis expression remained unchanged, and his voice increased in volume as righteously said, \u201cWe, the Chu family, are one of the Imperial City\u2019s four great families. We have always valued our family rules the most. As a junior, you dare to make me\u2014a senior\u2014come and invite you personally. Do you know that this is wrong?\u201dChu Liuyue chuckled as if she had just heard a joke and looked at First Elder. \u201cFirst Elder, you also know that you are a senior in the family? In all the years I was being bullied, did you ever show up even once as a senior to protect me?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d First Elder was tongue-tied. He averted his gaze. \u201cThere are so many things going on in the entire Chu family. It\u2019s normal to have occasional oversights\u2026\u201d\u201cThose oversights lasted a decade.\u201d Chu Liuyue cut him off. Her smile gradually faded, and her eyes turned cold. \u201cAt the age of five, a servant fed me poison. I was unconscious for three days and three nights, but I pulled through. At the age of seven, I wanted to practice cultivation like the other children, but I was told that I wasn\u2019t even qualified to visit the martial arts training ground.\u201cAt the age of ten, I could only leave the estate to go shopping for groceries. Even in the middle of the winter, I had to fetch water to wash the clothes for those lazy servants. My hands were frostbitten\u2026 How could First Elder not know about these things?\u201d said Chu Liuyue calmly. However, one could feel the deep despair and desolation coming from the bottom of her heart.What had a child done wrong to deserve such treatment?First Elder and the others were dumbfounded. The crowd fell silent as well.The whole Imperial City knew that the Chu family had a loser. Nevertheless, almost none of them remembered that this loser was also the Chu family\u2019s first trueborn. No matter what, there was no reason to be so harsh on her!First Elder flew into a rage out of humiliation and shouted, \u201cTh-That\u2019s all in the past. Besides, what happened didn\u2019t cause you any real harm, right? You have been accepted into Tian Lu Academy. What are you trying to do by bringing up all this now? Do you want the entire Chu family to apologize to you?\u201dChu Liuyue didn\u2019t respond. Her indifferent eyes swept past everyone like icy, sharp blades.Countless fragmented memories flickered in her mind. They all belonged to the body\u2019s original owner. Although she might not be the real Chu Liuyue, it was hard to suppress the anger and hatred welling inside her now that she had recalled those incidents.Perhaps, it was because she was using this body, or they might have even been in desperate situations. Since she was now Chu Liuyue, it was only natural for her to settle old and new grudges together!Chu Yan finally lost his cool and scolded loudly, \u201cChu Liuyue, you\u2019re so insensible! No matter what, the Chu family raised you without seeking merit or reward. Not only are you ungrateful now, but you\u2019ve even turned against us and accused us of being unfair to you in front of all these people! What the h*ll do you have in mind?\u201dChu Liuyue glanced at him. \u201cIsn\u2019t what I said the truth? Besides, the ones who raised me were my father and mother. When did the rest of the Chu family come into the picture? Chu Yan, I haven\u2019t settled the score with you for secretly bullying my father all these years, yet you have the nerve to say these things to me?\u201dBack then, Chu Ning was injured, and his strength had decreased. However, he still excelled in other aspects. Chu Ning deserved half of the credit for running the shop under Chu Yan\u2019s name so successfully. Nevertheless, Chu Ning was not valued for his hard work. He was repeatedly exploited by Chu Yan instead.The days of this father-daughter duo got tougher, and they were unable to make ends meet. Chu Ning also became more and more depressed.\u201cYou\u2019re insolent!\u201d Chu Yan never actually expected Chu Liuyue to berate him in public. For a moment, he was consumed by his anger, then he shuddered and pointed his shaking finger at Chu Liuyue. \u201cYou! You! Good for you, Chu Liuyue! Do you really think that you\u2019re so awesome just because you got into Tian Lu Academy?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t just pass the entrance exam; I passed all three categories of the assessment. Besides, I took second place in the Xuan Master examination and first place in the warrior examination.\u201d Chu Liuyue raised her eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019m not that awesome. I just happened to be slightly better than Chu Xianmin.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Chu Yan\u2019s anger hit the roof, but he couldn\u2019t outsmart Chu Liuyue! Everything she said was the truth!People with power were respected. There were no other words more powerful than these!\u201cEnough!\u201d First Elder suddenly shouted in anger and glared at Chu Liuyue. \u201cGo back right now! Think about your mistakes and repent in your room!\u201d\u201cFirst Elder, you seem to be mistaken about one thing. I didn\u2019t ask you here to invite me back in.\u201d Chu Liuyue remained at the same spot and declared, \u201cI came to cut all ties with the Chu family! From today onwards, I, Chu Liuyue, and my father\u2014Chu Ning\u2014are making a clean break from the Chu family clan once and for all! We will have nothing to do with each other in life and death!\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Do you understand?\u201d\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re saying?\u201d First Elder stared at Chu Liuyue in disbelief. He never imagined that she was capable of saying such things! \u201cBoth of you have the blood of the Chu family flowing through your veins. You have shown us great impiety and disrespect to say that! I knew you were going to turn things against us when you got accepted into Tian Lu Academy!\u201dNot only First Elder, but the entire Chu family was in a state of shock. It had just occurred to them that, once Chu Liuyue had turned over a new leaf, she might hold a grudge against them because of what happened in the past. She might even seek revenge. However, nobody imagined that she would have the resolve to choose to leave the Chu family!Even though she had become a genius, it was wishful thinking if she believed she could pit herself against the entire Chu family!The Chu family was one of the Imperial City\u2019s four great families and had a prestigious status. How many people would like the chance to form a connection with them? How could she have made such a decision?\u201cI\u2019m not here for a discussion, but to inform you.\u201d Chu Liuyue didn\u2019t seem to care about the commotion that her words had caused at all. Her expression remained calm and relaxed.Her words were simple and clear, yet they carried a hint of indisputable authority!Third Elder finally frowned. \u201cLiuyue, you can\u2019t say such nonsense. I know you\u2019re upset, but you\u2019re being too impulsive\u2026\u201d\u201cThird Elder, I\u2019ve made up my mind.\u201d Chu Liuyue was still polite when she spoke to Third Elder. This was because of the memories retained by the original body. Third Elder was one of the considerable few in the family who had ever helped her and her father.Chu Yin had no children. He had always held Chu Ning in high regard, even treating the latter like a son. However, too many things happened after that incident. As much as Third Elder wanted to help Chu Ning, he was unable to do anything about their situation.Third Elder wanted to say something when he looked at Chu Liuyue. In the end, he only managed a sigh. The bottom-line was that he was a useless man. If he had more authority in the family and helped them a little, Chu Ning and Chu Liuyue wouldn\u2019t have been reduced to such a state\u2026If Chu Liuyue hadn\u2019t been accepted into Tian Lu Academy today, there was no way he could\u2019ve mustered the courage to confront First Elder.This girl has obviously given up on the Chu family! It is too late for us to want to keep her now!Chu Yan\u2014who had been seething with anger\u2014finally came back to his senses. With some urgency, he abruptly asked, \u201cChu Liuyue! Chu Ning is not here now. Are your words also a representation of his wishes?\u201dThe departure of Chu Liuyue and Chu Ning might not be a good thing for the Chu family. However, it would be beneficial for Chu Yan and his family!Chu Ning would no longer be around to compete with him for the position as the next family head. Chu Liuyue would also be unable to utilize Chu family\u2019s best resources for geniuses!Everything in the family would belong to him when they left!Chu Liuyue saw the spark in his eyes. It was easy to guess what Chu Yan was thinking. She smiled and took her time to answer him. \u201cWhatever I\u2019ve said definitely reflects my father\u2019s wishes. Rest assured, my father and I will walk away with no further disputes. We also won\u2019t be involved with the Chu family\u2019s matters after we\u2019ve settled the final issue.She raised a finger. \u201cFirst, my mother\u2019s dowry weighed a total of 120 catties when she married my father. If I remember correctly, after my father was injured back then, you used the pretext of letting him recuperate without worries to allow Lu Yao to handle the dowry at her full discretion. Since I am severing my ties with you, it\u2019s time for you to return the dowry to me.\u201dChu Yan and Lu Yao suddenly went pale in unison.\u201cSecond, my father is the family head\u2019s son, after all. I was also once the entire Chu family\u2019s eldest daughter. Although the master of the family is not here, he will definitely feel bad if he knows that my father and I have left without a penny. It\u2019s not too much for us to ask for one-fifth of the Chu family\u2019s fortune, right?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re dreaming!\u201d Chu Yan was the first to object. \u201cWe have so many sons and daughters in the family. Do you and your father think it is that easy to walk away with one-fifth of our family\u2019s fortune?\u201dChu Liuyue bluntly said, \u201cI\u2019m sure all of you have witnessed how much my father has done for the Chu family over the years. If you don\u2019t want to give it to us, that\u2019s fine. I will go to His Majesty and seek justice. Let\u2019s see if it is fair for us to have a part of the fortune then.\u201dChu Yan promptly shut his mouth.Everyone knew that Chu Ning had injured himself all those years ago because he was protecting the emperor. If word of this really reached His Majesty, the emperor would definitely treat Chu Ning fairly, even if it was out of consideration for his benevolent reputation!That would only humiliate the Chu family more!First Elder laughed in exasperation. \u201cFine! Fine! You\u2019ve got it all figured out! Since this is the case, both of you are not allowed to set foot in the Chu family again from now onwards! I\u2019d like to see how you are going to survive in the Imperial City!\u201dWithout the Chu family to back them up, they might not even have a place to stay!Chu Liuyue blinked and smiled. \u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about us, First Elder. I already bought a new mansion on West Street a few days ago. It might not be as big as the Chu Mansion, but it\u2019s very clean and free from all the nonsense. Today is the tenth day of the eighth month\u2014an auspicious day to rid ourselves from the bad and move into a new place!\u201dLiked it?

She had secretly purchased a mansion and waited till she was accepted into Tian Lu Academy before completely turning against the family!This way, she could get rid of the Chu family once and for all!First Elder and the others almost passed out from anger once they realized that Chu Liuyue had made all the preparations.If it was in the past, there wouldn\u2019t be any objections if Chu Ning and Chu Liuyue did this. They would even be secretly glad to rid themselves of the two black sheep. However, Chu Liuyue\u2019s status had changed drastically. This was equivalent to them being abandoned by Chu Liuyue.If word of this incident got out, the Chu family would lose face!\u201cFirst Elder, Chu Liuyue has simply gone too far. I think we really don\u2019t have to keep her any longer!\u201d Chu Yan took a deep breath and started to persuade First Elder.They could afford to be embarrassed. What mattered most was to nip this in the bud completely!Nevertheless, not everyone agreed with Chu Yan.\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be so rash. After all, Chu Liuyue is now a rare genius. The other family clans yearn to have one but can\u2019t. If we let her go just like that, it\u2019ll be our great loss.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! Besides, they are the Chu family\u2019s trueborn direct descendants. The matter of severing ties is of great importance. Our family head is not around, so we have to be extremely careful\u2026\u201dFirst Elder was unhappy to hear their opinions. He coldly glared at the ones who dared to speak up. \u201cWhat? Do you not trust me? Or you think I don\u2019t have the authority to decide?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get us wrong, First Elder. That\u2019s not what we meant\u2026\u201d\u201cHmph! Chu Liuyue is conniving and unscrupulous! Minmin is her sister, yet she wounded her mercilessly! Moreover, she harbors a grudge against us. If we keep such a cruel person, she is bound to wreak havoc in the Chu family!\u201d said Chu Yan with contempt.First Elder looked uncertain, and he was silent for a long time. After he got over the shock, he carefully considered it and was eager to agree to this matter immediately.Among other issues, the relationship between him and Chu Ning, as well as Chu Liuyue, was strained. They even had an ongoing feud. He absolutely didn\u2019t believe that they didn\u2019t hate him.If Chu Liuyue remains in the Chu family, she will definitely be highly regarded in the future. When she reaches adulthood, I fear that my bitter days will come! Nevertheless, it will be hard to explain to the family head.\u201cFirst Elder, Chu Liuyue may be gifted, but she is stubborn and vicious. She really can\u2019t stay! Besides, her future won\u2019t be easy after leaving the family. We don\u2019t have to worry about the consequences. As for Chu Ning, what\u2019s there to be concerned about a cripple?\u201d said Chu Yan softly.First Elder clenched his teeth. \u201cSomeone, bring me a pen and paper!\u201dChu Liuyue is the one who brought this up. Even if the family head does come out of his seclusion and seeks accountability, it will be Chu Liuyue\u2019s fault!\u201cDon\u2019t bother. I have already written the declaration for severance and property division.\u201d After that, Chu Liuyue really took out two pieces of paper from her bosom and handed them over sincerely. \u201cFirst Elder, I just need your fingerprint on the papers.\u201dA few snickers could be heard coming from the crowd.Chu Liuyue was really heartless; she had prepared everything beforehand!First Elder\u2019s face reddened. He almost exploded with anger! He snatched the two pieces of paper and read through them once while suppressing his anger. Once he was sure that the papers were in order, he bit his finger hard without hesitation and pressed it onto the papers!\u201cTake it! From today onwards, you are no longer a member of our family!\u201d First Elder angrily threw the two pieces of paper back to Chu Liuyue.Chu Liuyue didn\u2019t mind at all. She examined the bright-red fingerprints and waved the two pieces of papers with a smile on her lips. \u201cGreat! From now on, I\u2019ll hit the high road while you cross the log bridge! However, please remember to send the things on the list to my residence within three days. I don\u2019t like to leave my stuff with others.\u201d\u201cGet lost!\u201d First Elder finally lost it. He shouted in anger, then threw his hands up before leaving and saying, \u201cClose the gates!\u201dAs soon as First Elder said that, a surprised feminine voice called out from not far away. \u201cOh, so many people are here. What\u2019s happening?\u201dEveryone turned in the direction of that voice and saw a pale, beardless man dressed in official attire. He was definitely from the palace!The crowd parted to make a path for him.That man approached curiously. Finally, he saw Chu Liuyue, First Elder, and the others at the gate.He was suddenly happy. \u201cMy goodness, isn\u2019t this Big Chu Missy? His Majesty is so pleased to hear that you\u2019ve been accepted into Tian Lu Academy!\u201dChu Liuyue smiled and bowed. \u201cEunuch Min, you\u2019re too kind. I will be sure to head to the palace to thank His Majesty personally another day.\u201dEunuch Min was a popular person by His Majesty\u2019s side. His status was more prestigious compared to the average courtiers. Nobody should offend him.First Elder coughed, quickly adjusted his expression, and forced a smile onto his face. \u201cEunuch Min, what brings you here? Does His Majesty need something?\u201d\u201cOh! I\u2019m here to announce the good news! It\u2019s a double blessing for your family today!\u201d\u201cDouble blessings? May I know what you are talking about?\u201dEunuch Min gave a joyous smile, gesturing with his thumb and middle finger joined while extending the rest of his fingers. \u201cNaturally, the first blessing is that your Big Missy has been admitted into Tian Lu Academy. She also did exceptionally well, taking second place in the Xuan Master assessment and first place for the warrior assessment.\u201cThe second blessing is that Lord Chu Ning has successfully broken through to become a stage-five warrior after recovering from his old injuries! His Majesty is so pleased that he has appointed Lord Chu Ning to be the imperial guards\u2019 Commander in Chief! I\u2019m here to give you these two pieces of good news!

Instead, they looked like they had swallowed a fly!Eunuch Min\u2019s smile faded slightly, sensing something was amiss. \u201cT-This\u2026 What\u2019s wrong with you people?\u201dFirst Elder came back to his senses, looked at Eunuch Min, and tried to say something. However, there seemed to be a blockage in his throat, and he couldn\u2019t utter a single word.\u201cHow can this be? He suffered severe trauma back then. Several heavenly doctors diagnosed him and declared that the probability of him recovering in his lifetime was slim to none! How did he recover so abruptly and even break through to become a stage-five warrior?\u201d Chu Yan shouted, stunned.I don\u2019t believe it! This can\u2019t be true!Eunuch Min narrowed his eyes, his smile cold. \u201cWhat is this? Lord Chu Yan, are you suspecting me of falsely passing on an imperial decree?\u201dChu Yan froze. \u201cNo, no! I didn\u2019t mean that! I was\u2026 I was simply in shock. This\u2026 There was no news of this at all before! H-how can\u2026\u201dEunuch Min dusted himself. He was well aware of this matter. Chu Ning and his daughter had suffered some years back. Their position in the Chu family had been awkward, and they had been ostracized.It was normal that Chu Ning hadn\u2019t told them about his recovery and his breakthrough as a stage-five warrior.After all, some people in the Chu family would be anxious once they got wind of this news. Wasn\u2019t that how Chu Yan had just reacted?Chu Ning\u2019s rise would be Chu Yan\u2019s greatest threat, so he certainly wouldn\u2019t accept it!Nevertheless, Eunuch Min didn\u2019t bother to expose the elder. He smiled. \u201cNot to mention you, even His Majesty has also just been informed today. His Majesty has been brooding about Lord Chu Ning\u2019s injuries. When he heard that Lord Chu Ning broke through and became a stage-five warrior, he was overjoyed. Coincidentally, the position of the imperial guards\u2019 Commander in Chief is vacant. Lord Chu Ning would be the perfect candidate for the job! His Majesty has also said he\u2019s keeping the lord in the palace tonight for a late chat!\u201dChu Yan closed his eyes. Eunuch Min\u2019s words were clearly a warning to him.Even His Majesty didn\u2019t know about it. So what was the big deal that he hadn\u2019t been informed?This only meant that His Majesty was the first person Chu Ning had told because none of them knew about it! What better way to show one\u2019s loyalty than that?His Majesty would just trust Chu Ning more!What else could he say?The Commander in Chief of the imperial guards was a powerful position.The only people who had ever held this position were those with outstanding capability and favored by His Majesty! Even Chu Ning\u2014who was in the limelight back then\u2014had only been a small captain in the imperial guards.Chu Ning actually skipped a few levels after his recovery and was directly promoted to the imperial guards\u2019 Commander in Chief! From now on, he would surely be the most popular person in the Imperial City!\u201cBy His Majesty\u2019s grace, this is a big deal. First Elder, the whole family should be rejoicing, right?\u201d Eunuch Min continued.First Elder opened his mouth and forced a smile on his face. He looked worse than when crying. \u201cY-you have a point\u2026\u201dChu Liuyue stepped forward with a smile and interrupted First Elder by saying, \u201cEunuch Min, thank you for making this trip. This is indeed a great joy. We will definitely throw a banquet to celebrate when Father returns tomorrow. Eunuch Min, no matter what, please grace us with your presence and come for the banquet when the time comes!\u201dChu Liuyue had spoken appropriately. Eunuch Min liked her even more after he saw her behaving so sensibly. \u201cBig Chu Missy, you are too humble! Lord Chu Ning and yourself are both persons that possess great ability! You only make me admire you more! I\u2019ll be sure to congratulate you in person then. Look at the doorstep. From now on, I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s going to be a crowd at your door!\u201dChu Liuyue shook her head and cast a meaningful look at First Elder and the others. \u201cThe step is too high. I\u2019m worried it\u2019ll wear you out. Let\u2019s move to another place. Oh, you might not know that I have just severed my ties with the Chu family. From today onwards, my father and I have nothing to do with the Chu family!\u201dAlthough Eunuch Min was used to seeing all sorts of occasions, he, too, was shocked by Chu Liuyue\u2019s words. \u201cWhat?\u201dChu Liuyue smiled nonchalantly. \u201cIn other words, the two joyous pieces of news have nothing to do with the Chu family and these people!

I\u2019m afraid the Emperor doesn\u2019t know about it yet\u2026\u201d said Eunuch Min hesitantly as he looked at First Elder and the rest.\u201cIs this confirmed?\u201d\u201cThe contract is already written, and we have many witnesses, so it\u2019s confirmed. Don\u2019t worry, Eunuch Min. I\u2019ll explain this to the Emperor personally another day.\u201dSeeing that none of the Chu family members were willing to explain this incident, Eunuch Min knew that there was no turning back on the matter and could not help but sigh secretly. He did not expect that the rumored cowardly and weak Chu family\u2019s good-for-nothing could actually be so bold and decisive.Severing her ties with the Chu family was akin to gaining a huge enemy for herself. However, now that Chu Ning was the imperial guards\u2019 Commander in Chief and Chu Liuyue was a talent everyone admired, the Chu family would not dare to do anything to them openly.Eunuch Min had always been a sensible person and quickly gathered his thoughts. As he bowed towards Chu Liuyue, he smiled and said, \u201cThen, I\u2019ll congratulate Officer Chu and Ms. Liuyue on your honor. I still have other things to attend to, so I\u2019ll take my leave first.\u201dChu Liuyue knew that Eunuch Min did not want to interfere with their family\u2019s affairs and readily said, \u201cEunuch Min, please be careful on your way out.\u201dEunuch Min then bade farewell to First Elder and the rest before leaving quickly.Chu Liuyue did not stay any longer and turned around to leave. When she took a step out, she suddenly remembered something and turned back to say, \u201cOh yes. I heard that many people in the Imperial City sent gifts to the residence. All of these should be for me, so may I trouble you to send them over with the other items?\u201dAfter she finished her sentence, she did not bother to look at those people\u2019s wretched expressions and left relaxingly.First Elder glared at Chu Liuyue\u2019s back view with a deadly gaze, wanting to go up to her and teach her a lesson. However, he still held himself back and hollered, \u201cLet\u2019s go back!\u201dBang!The Chu family residence\u2019s gate was shut tightly after the crowd went back in. However, the major news of what happened in the Chu family had immediately spread across the Imperial City.\u2026\u201cFirst Elder, this Chu Liuyue is such a bully! If we don\u2019t get back at her for what we suffered today, how can we hold ourselves up high in the Imperial City?\u201dAfter they returned to the residence, First Elder only asked the few people who had the most say in the Chu family to stay and discuss the issue.Chu Yan was the first to speak, and he looked infuriated.First Elder\u2019s face darkened, but he did not say a word.\u201cYeah! Even if she has entered Tian Lu Academy, she\u2019s way too arrogant! If she dares to do this now, who knows what she\u2019ll do in the future?\u201d\u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything this time round and take it lying, the entire Imperial City will think that we\u2019re cowards. I won\u2019t let her go this easily.\u201d\u201cHmph, does that Chu Liuyue think she can have a stable life after leaving the Chu family? We should let her see what we are capable of. If not, she really will think that we have nothing against her.\u201dThe few people broke into heated discussions as if they wanted to let Chu Liuyue know how formidable they were immediately.Third Elder stood at the side and shook his head as he lightly said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget that she still has Chu Ning.\u201dThe few people were instantly stumped.Chu Ning was currently the imperial guards\u2019 Commander in Chief\u2026 It was indeed a tough situation.\u201c\u2026 So what? Can Chu Ning alone go against our entire Chu family?\u201d Chu Yan laughed sinisterly, and cruelty flashed across his eyes. \u201cThe various powers are deeply connected to each other in the Imperial City. It may seem like Chu Ning and Chu Liuyue have turned the tables, but things aren\u2019t so simple. Since they decided to sever ties with us, they need to have the courage to accept the consequences.\u201dThis sentence enlightened First Elder as he paced back and forth before finally making a decision. \u201cThat\u2019s right! Didn\u2019t Chu Liuyue say that she wanted to hold a celebratory banquet? I would like to see how many people in the Imperial City will go!\u201d\u2026Chu Liuyue walked to her new mansion alone. She was in a good mood today after settling a few issues.It was already evening, and a gentle breeze blew her loose strands of hair up in the air.The setting sun cast a long shadow over her.She walked step by step in rare relaxation and freedom.During the entire month after her rebirth, she had nervously been planning everything. Now, she could finally relax a little.The bustling noise in the surroundings gradually disappeared and quietened down.Chu Liuyue looked up and could see the green roof of her new mansion. She used 100,000 of the 300,000 silver taels she earned from selling the hunting ground to buy this mansion.The mansion was located in the Imperial City\u2019s western region. It was very isolated and quiet. Distinguished families would normally not like it here, but Chu Liuyue loved it at first sight.She had had enough of the beautiful but cold palaces in her previous life. She no longer held any interest in them after she was reborn. She liked quiet places like this even more.Her lips could not help but curve up into a smile when she thought of her and Chu Ning spending the rest of their lives away from the people in the Chu family.Suddenly, something cold dropped on her face.Chu Liuyue was taken aback and looked up.Water droplets fell down rapidly, quickly forming a line.It was raining!Chu Liuyue hastened her steps. Her house was located at the end of the marble path around the corner in front. However, Chu Liuyue was stunned after she turned around the corner.A person was standing in front of the mansion at the end of the simple marble path. He was tall and wore a snow-white robe with a black cloak.The sky quickly changed to grayish-blue as the rain poured down, erecting an invisible rain scene between heaven and earth.The rain landed and splashed on the marble path and formed a thin layer of white mist, causing the view in front to be blurred. However, she could still see the man\u2019s distinguished face clearly.The white and black clothes complemented his cold and handsome appearance. He was like a flower at the top of the mountain that one could only look at.It was actually\u2026Rong Xiu? The moment the name flashed across Chu Liuyue\u2019s heart, the man started walking towards her.He looked like he was emerging from the darkness as the sky turned dark, and the rain poured down.For some reason, Chu Liuyue felt that this Rong Xiu was different from before. She could not help but inch closer towards him.Finally, Rong Xiu walked to Chu Liuyue and stood in front of her firmly.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Chu Liuyue spoke hesitantly.Hua!Rong Xiu suddenly raised his hand, and a black figure swept past. Suddenly, the rain above Chu Liuyue\u2019s head disappeared.Rong Xiu held a black umbrella up for her.Chu Liuyue looked up at him and met his gaze.Rong Xiu\u2019s dark eyes were as bottomless as the night sky.\u201cYue\u2019er.\u201d His cold and misty voice contained a tinge of undetectable love. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you for a long time.\u201dLiked it?

How did Rong Xiu find out, even coming to this place to wait for her?Rong Xiu\u2019s gaze shifted and landed on the raindrops on her face. He immediately bent down a bit lower and raised his hand.\u201cHey\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201dChu Liuyue instinctively wanted to stop him, but she subconsciously retracted her hand when she heard his voice.Rong Xiu\u2019s fingers were long, white, and had distinct joints, but his skin felt incredibly soft as he gently wiped away the raindrops on her face. Rong Xiu was very close to Chu Liuyue, to the point that she could clearly feel his long black lashes trembling slightly.He looked very serious as if this was an important task.For some reason, Chu Liuyue held her breath.This moment seemed to be much longer than usual.After some time, Rong Xiu suddenly laughed before speaking in a low voice. \u201cBreathe.\u201dChu Liuyue instinctively answered with an \u201cOh\u201d and heaved a sigh of relief.The warm breaths that landed on his face felt like landing meteorites, burning his face instantly. Rong Xiu paused in his actions, and his eyes darkened.\u201cAre you done?\u201d asked Chu Liuyue. Is there a need to wipe so long? I was only in the rain for a while.Rong Xiu silently retracted his hand, and his fingers curled up and brushed past her lips as if it were unintentional.It happened in a flash, but Chu Liuyue\u2019s heart tingled, and she suddenly felt awkward.She looked up at Rong Xiu but saw that he had already retracted his hands. He looked very calm as if he did not notice anything wrong.It\u2026 shouldn\u2019t be on purpose\u2026 But why does he have to wipe my face every time we meet? Chu Liuyue muttered in her heart and suppressed the ripple she previously felt as she once again asked, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dRong Xiu smiled. He directly held Chu Liuyue\u2019s hand and walked back while slowly saying, \u201cLet\u2019s talk when we go home.\u201dChu Liuyue lowered her head, and her lips twitched. Go home? That\u2019s my home, not yours! What\u2019s with your righteous tone?\u201cPrince Li, what are you doing?\u201dEven though no one is around, we shouldn\u2019t be doing this, right?\u201cI\u2019m cold,\u201d said Rong Xiu lightly. His righteous attitude stumped Chu Liuyue; she could not think of how to retort him in such a short time.Rong Xiu pulled her closer again.Chu Liuyue raised her brows. \u201cYour Highness, you won\u2019t feel warm this way.\u201dRong Xiu nodded. \u201cMm, but at least I won\u2019t get wet.\u201dChu Liuyue was dazed, and her gaze shifted.The cloak on his body was truly slightly drenched.She suddenly remembered that the umbrella was tilted towards her side when Rong Xiu held it up for her. After taking the umbrella incident into consideration, Chu Liuyue decided not to pursue the matter.The two of them walked on without saying a word and reached the front door.Chu Liuyue struggled a little, so Rong Xiu naturally let go of her hands.Chu Liuyue then opened the door and walked in. After walking forward two steps, she turned around as she suddenly thought of something.Rong Xiu was still standing outside the door, not looking like he intended to leave.Chu Liuyue clenched her teeth in secret. \u201cYour Highness, do you want to sit in my humble home for a while?\u201dRong Xiu\u2019s lips separated slightly. \u201cSince you\u2019re so hospitable, I won\u2019t reject you,\u201d said Rong Xiu as he walked in.Chu Liuyue was speechless. Why didn\u2019t I see that Rong Xiu was so shameless before?\u2026Chu Liuyue only came to this mansion once\u2014it was when she bought it\u2014and it was still rather dirty then.After the renovation, it looked much cleaner and more exquisite.Chu Liuyue invited Rong Xiu to take a seat as she went to make some ginger tea.\u201cMy house is rather simple, and I have nothing much to serve you.\u201d Chu Liuyue no longer busied herself after she offered Rong Xiu some tea and sat opposite him.\u201cThis ginger tea will suffice.\u201d Rong Xiu seemed like he did not mind at all as he poured two cups of tea\u2014one for Chu Liuyue and one for himself. He gently sipped his cup of tea.The white steam rose up, causing his brows to relax.His words and actions did not make him look like a prince, and he really seemed pretty satisfied\u2026Chu Liuyue was curious. This ginger tea is a very common item, and the smell is a bit harsh to the nose. Aristocratic children will usually find faults with it, but he is still drinking it so leisurely. Did he live bitter and simple days at Mingyue Tianshan previously?\u201cIt seems like you didn\u2019t have good days before,\u201d said Chu Liuyue on purpose. \u201cYou\u2019re used to drinking things like ginger tea.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not\u201d\u2014Rong Xiu smiled\u2014\u201dbut it\u2019s rare for you to make it for me. Thus, I got used to it, even if I\u2019m not.\u201dI got used to it, even if I\u2019m not\u2026Rong Xiu\u2019s tone was as calm as before, but the sentence sounded very flirtatious.Chu Liuyue did not know what to say and tightly pressed her lips against each other. She really would be stupid if she could not guess Rong Xiu\u2019s feelings towards her.Helping her once was a coincidence, but what about the second time and the third time? However, she did not know what exactly Rong Xiu saw in her.Her looks?When they first met, her yellow skin looked like a vegetable; she was definitely ugly then.Talent?She only entered Tian Lu Academy academy today.Identity?An average person would run away from her\u2014the ex-fianc\u00e9e abandoned by the Crown Prince and a Big Missy detested by the Chu family\u2014let alone Prince Li with a distinguished status.\u201cYour Highness, let\u2019s be honest with each other. Just say your thoughts directly.\u201d Chu Liuyue took a deep breath in, straightened her back, and looked at Rong Xiu seriously. \u201cWhy did you come here today? Or rather, what do you want from me? Even if I managed to turn the tables for myself today, I have very little power. I can\u2019t help you much, so you\u2019re just wasting your time and effort on me.\u201dRong Xiu turned the teacup in his hands and looked down in silence. After a while, he looked up at her.The two of them stared straight into each other\u2019s eyes.Rong Xiu\u2019s eyes sparkled with countless stars, reflecting the young girl\u2019s entire face. \u201cI came here to celebrate your birthday.\u201dChu Liuyue was taken aback.Rong Xiu suddenly took out a wooden box, which exuded a light fragrance. It was a very intricate agarwood box. \u201cThis is a gift for you.\u201dChu Liuyue took it hesitantly, and the box opened with a slight move of her fingers.A peach blossom hairpin quietly laid inside.Liked it?

It was currently summer, so there would not be snow.Chu Liuyue took a closer look at it and shockingly discovered that the snowflakes were carved from a very valuable moonstone. Moonstones were a type of rare gem, which sparkled under the sunlight and gently glowed like the moonlight when in the dark.Chu Liuyue was very shocked.Even though Rong Xiu was Country Yao Chen\u2019 Seventh Prince, Country Yao Chen did not amount to much in the entire Mainland Xuan Wu.If it were her in her previous life, it would not be difficult for her to obtain this moonstone as the Tianling Dynasty\u2019s princess. However, this was definitely a rare treasure for the people in Country Yao Chen.Why does Rong Xiu have such a thing? Also, why did he give me such a valuable gift?Chu Liuyue closed the box and passed it back to him. \u201cPrince Li, this gift is too valuable. I can\u2019t accept it.\u201dRong Xiu looked straight into her eyes. \u201cToday is the day where you become of marriageable age. According to the rules, your family elder should hold a ceremony for you and give you a hairpin.\u201dChu Liuyue kept quiet.Rong Xiu was right. The day when one reached marriageable age was very important to the women in Mainland Xuan Wu. This was because it meant that a woman had become an adult and could marry now.Even if one were from an average family, their family would specifically hire someone to give a hairpin to the girl.This was an even more formal ceremony for girls from aristocratic families.Many neighboring countries had specifically come forth to deliver gifts to her when she became of marriageable age in her previous life. The celebratory banquet lasted for a total of three days and three nights.It was a really important event back then.After being reborn, she had always been planning how to escape from her perilous situation and take revenge. She did not even care about such things.Today was the day she became of marriageable age, but she had severed ties with the Chu family. Her only family member, Chu Ning, was still in the palace and had not returned yet.If Rong Xiu did not come, she would just spend her day like any other. However, he did come. He had even brought an extravagant gift.\u201cI accept your kind intentions, Your Highness, but I really can\u2019t accept\u2014\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t accept it today, I\u2019ll come again and give it to you tomorrow.\u201d Rong Xiu ignored her rejection, and his lips curved up slightly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t accept it, I\u2019ll just come another day. I\u2019ll continue coming every day until you accept it.\u201dChu Liuyue was speechless. Upon seeing Rong Xiu\u2019s nonchalant and calm expression, Chu Liuyue confirmed that he could deliver on what he said.She ground her teeth. \u201cYour Highness, has anyone ever told you that you\u2019re very thick-skinned?\u201dRong Xiu leaned against the chair and laughed lightly. \u201cI just returned to the Imperial City and have been resting in my residence. I haven\u2019t heard anyone say this to me yet.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKa!Chu Liuyue opened the box again, pointed at the peach blossom hairpin, and asked, \u201cYour Highness, peach blossoms bloom in spring. Why does your hairpin have snowflakes on it?\u201d\u201cPeach blossoms can bloom in winter too.\u201d\u201cHow can it be? Have you seen it before?\u201d Chu Liuyue chuckled in her heart.Rong Xiu really could not say anything to retort. However, Rong Xiu suddenly looked up and stared at her deeply.This look reminded Chu Liuyue of the first time she saw him standing in the rain. He had also directed such a gaze at her back then.She could not guess what he was thinking and even felt that Rong Xiu saw another person through her.\u201cI\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d He closed his eyes and hid the ripples in them. He sighed lightly and said in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019ve seen peach blossoms brightly shining as snow danced around them.\u201dLiked it?

He seemed to be missing the scenery he was describing, but he seemed like he was missing someone even more.Where can one see blooming peach blossoms in winter? Also, who is that person he can\u2019t forget? No matter what, they clearly are extremely important to him.Chu Liuyue hesitated before she decided to keep the peach blossom hairpin. \u201cThank you, Your Highness.\u201dRong Xiu rested his hand on his cheek as he spaced out. The warm candlelight on his face accentuated his outstanding features.Chu Liuyue looked outside. The rain was getting heavier, with no sign of stopping soon. She then asked, \u201cYour Highness, do the people from your residence know that you\u2019re here? They should be coming to pick you up since it\u2019s raining so heavily, right?\u201dEven though he had an umbrella, it was a little much to make Prince Li brave the rain on his return journey, especially since he had just given her a big gift.Rong Xiu glanced at her with a half-smile. \u201cDo you not want to see me? You\u2019re in such a hurry for me to leave.\u201d\u201cHow can that be? It\u2019s our honor to have you visit! However, our place is a little shabby and cannot be compared to Prince Li Mansion,\u201d said Chu Liuyue seriously.\u201cI think this place isn\u2019t bad.\u201d Rong Xiu knocked on the table. \u201cBesides, my body has been weak recently, so I can\u2019t stand the cold. If the rain continues, I might have to impose on you for the night.\u201dChu Liuyue\u2014who had picked up a teacup for tea\u2014almost flung the cup out as her eyes widened in shock. \u201cYou want to stay here?! How can that be?!\u201dThis was her first day in this place! Rong Xiu was not related to her in any way, so how could he just sleep here?\u201cYour residence is rather big. It should at least have a guest room, right?\u201d Rong Xiu looked a little surprised too.\u201c\u2026\u201d Chu Liuyue was at a loss for words.There were a number of rooms in the mansion, but she bought it for its tranquility in the first place. Therefore, she only prepared two bedrooms\u2014one for Chu Ning and one for herself.There was no space for him!Chu Liuyue immediately relayed the situation to Rong Xiu. \u201c\u2026 Your Highness, I\u2019m not chasing you away, but there\u2019s really no room for you here. My father will be back later tonight\u2026\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t your father go into the palace to meet Father? I heard that Father is really happy and intends to talk with Officer Chu through the night.\u201dChu Liuyue glanced at Rong Xiu warily.It was not strange for him to know that. Eunuch Min had said this at the door earlier, so anyone who wanted to know could find out easily.Besides, as a prince, Rong Xiu had the clearest grasp on the workings of the palace. Prince Li was not as harmless and gentle as he looked.\u201cFather will return when they are done talking. As a daughter, I cannot not leave a room for my father.\u201dRong Xiu nodded in agreement. \u201cThat\u2019s true. As a junior, we should not impose on the elders.\u201d But before Chu Liuyue could relax, he continued, \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, then\u2026 I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to put Yue\u2019er in a spot.\u201dChu Liuyue was about to slam the table in protest, but she saw Rong Xiu begin coughing as if he would pass out if he caught a cold.This fellow is hell-bent on staying here! Chu Liuyue clenched her fists then released them before she got up. \u201cOur place is shabby and dilapidated. I ask for Your Highness\u2019s understanding should you catch a cold.\u201dRong Xiu\u2019s coughing finally stopped. \u201cThank you, Yue\u2019er.\u2019\u2026His skin is as thick as the city walls! What poised gentleman? That\u2019s all a farce! He is clearly a shameless lecher! Chu Liuyue thought to herself as she laid the bed.Hua!She flung the blankets hard.Bang!She slammed the windows shut.Bang bang bang!She threw the pillow down harshly.\u201cYue\u2019er, even though the pillow is made of wood, I don\u2019t think they can take that much force\u2026\u201d Rong Xiu reminded. He felt his eyelids twitch as he watched her.Chu Liuyue broke into a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry! It\u2019s quite solid! Aren\u2019t I just afraid that you won\u2019t sleep well?\u201dRong Xiu kept his mouth shut. As he looked at her angry expression, he curled his lips into a smile.\u201cOkay! Everything is tidied up! You can rest here now!\u201d Chu Liuyue was prepared to leave after she was done.Rong Xiu took a step forward and blocked her. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201dChu Liuyue looked at him strangely. \u201cI gave up this place to you, so I naturally have to go somewhere else.\u201dRong Xiu shook his head. \u201cI get sleep paralysis easily, so I can\u2019t be left alone.\u201dChu Liuyue widened her eyes slowly.\u201cSo, you\u2026\u201dPlop!A white figure broke in through the window, landing on the floor!The pair looked over.Chu Liuyue was pleasantly surprised! \u201cXue Xue, why are you here?\u201dXue Xue laid on the ground, its fluffy fur wet because of the rain, making him look much slimmer. It wanted to turn and get up when it heard Chu Liuyue\u2019s voice, but\u2026 a cold glare pinned it to the ground. It dared not move, pretending that it had accidentally fallen into the room.Chu Liuyue turned to look at Rong Xiu with a smug smile. \u201cXue Xue is here, so it can accompany you. Xue Xue is smart, so it will take good care of you, right?\u201dRong Xiu looked at Xue Xue. \u201cEn,\u201d he said coldly.Xue Xue shuddered. The next instant, it shook off the rainwater as a blue flame enveloped its body, evaporating the rest of the rainwater. After that, it had returned to its usual clean look.It then ran over to Rong Xiu, giving him an obedient look.Chu Liuyue\u2019s gloominess was swept away, and she left with light footsteps.In the room, awkward silence enveloped the man and beast.\u201cYou came in at just the right moment this time, en?\u201dLiked it?

He had helped her out a few times, so she owed him. It was nothing to let him stay for a night.Upon walking out of the bedroom, she pondered for a moment before heading to the study room.There was a bed in the study room as well, but Chu Liuyue did not intend to sleep. She wanted to make a breakthrough and finally become a true warrior today!Chu Liuyue closed the windows and doors before she sat on the bed with folded legs and slowly closed her eyes.This body had the Dijing Yuan meridian, so she cultivated much faster than other cultivators. Therefore, even though her Yuan meridian had only been restored recently, there was an ample amount of Heaven and Earth Force in Chu Liuyue\u2019s body.Since she had gotten into Tian Lu Academy, she no longer needed to hide the fact that her Yuan meridian had been restored.The room was rather quiet.Soon, the Heaven and Earth Force began converging towards Chu Liuyue\u2019s body.Tonight, I shall make a breakthrough to become a warrior!\u2026The rainy night was destined to be eventful.The Lu family.\u201cYan\u2019er, did Chu Liuyue really beat Minmin in the assessment?\u201dAfter the assessment, the school had a three-day break. The moment Lu Feiyan arrived home, she was pulled into the study room and interrogated over what happened in the academy.Lu Feiyan pouted. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201dThe members of the Lu family looked at one another.\u201cThis\u2026 Did Chu Liuyue really go from zero to hero?\u201d They did not believe it when they first heard the news.How could Chu Liuyue\u2014who had a lacking Yuan meridian that even heavenly doctors could not fix\u2014recover?However, they now had no choice but to believe it!\u201cHmph, I think it\u2019s strange. That Chu Liuyue must have resorted to some tactics to defeat Minmin! She\u2019s vicious. Not only did she defeat Minmin, but she disfigured her too! Minmin hates her guts now!\u201dThe adults were stunned and shook their heads when they heard what had happened.\u201cThis Chu Liuyue has really offended the Chu family now! She is different than before, and Chu Ning has become the Commander in Chief of the imperial guards, so they are arrogant! But I think it\u2019ll be difficult for them to survive in the Imperial City\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Chu family has sent word, Second Elder\u2026\u201d\u201cEven though we don\u2019t really get along with the Chu family, Minmin does carry Lu family blood in her. Besides, a starving camel is still bigger than a horse. There\u2019s no need to offend the Chu family now.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u2026Gu family.Even though it was vacation time, Gu Mingfeng did not return home, as usual.The members of the Gu family were not bothered by it. Instead, they were discussing what attitude they should have towards the Chu family.\u201cChu Ning\u2019s status is different now. If we don\u2019t show him some respect, won\u2019t it be the same as disrespecting His Majesty? The Chu family is on the decline, so there\u2019s no need to be so wary of them\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if that\u2019s the case, the Chu family still has some formidable characters! No matter how excellent Chu Ning is, he\u2019s still alone. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll prevail over the people from the Chu Family!\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, we\u2026\u201d\u201cSupport the Chu family!\u201d\u2026Si family.No long after Si Ting and Si Yang returned home, the head of the household, Si Ye, called them in for questioning.There was only the trio in the room.\u201cWhat do you all think of Chu Liuyue?\u201d Si Ye asked directly.\u201cSir, that Chu Liuyue is rather formidable! She\u2019s only slightly weaker than Big Brother! The Chu Family has really been blind all these years!\u201d Si Yang said excitedly.Si Ye put his hands behind his back. \u201cChu Liuyue broke off her relations with the Chu family today.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Si Yang cried out loud. However, he did not see anything wrong with her actions when he thought of the way the Chu family treated her. \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s understandable she did this after the way they treated her\u2026 She\u2019s bold!\u201dSi Ting, who had been silent, looked towards Si Ye. \u201cMaster, your choice?\u201dSuch wit and wisdom make a person made for big things. Si Ye looked at him approvingly. \u201cChu family. In fact, it won\u2019t be just me. Everyone in the Imperial City will probably make the same choice. The Chu Family\u2026 I\u2019m afraid they won\u2019t give her the chance or time to grow.\u201dHowever, Si Ting shook his head. \u201cI would like to ask you to choose Chu Liuyue.\u201dSi Ye was stunned. \u201cWhy?\u201dSi Ting was silent for an instant. \u201cHer abilities are way above mine.

The Heaven and Earth Force was drawn into her body and flowed towards her dantian via her Yuan meridian. However, they did not form a pearl of essence. Instead, the force was absorbed into the small lake.In order to become a true warrior, one had to form a pearl of essence.In Chu Liuyue\u2019s case, she had ample amounts of force in her body, so forming a pearl of essence could not be any simpler. However, she still couldn\u2019t pool the Heaven and Earth Force together after so long!Instead, it kept on flowing into the lake. The energy disappeared without a trace as if it had been consumed. The lake didn\u2019t even ripple once.Chu Liuyue slowly realized the severity of the situation. If this goes on, does that mean that I can\u2019t form a pearl of essence and become a warrior?!A pearl of essence meant a lot to warriors!Especially after the fourth stage, the pearl of essence was of utmost importance to cultivators!If she did not have a pearl of essence, she could not be considered a true warrior, and her ability would be greatly restricted.Chu Liuyue tried to retain the force and pool it together, but she could not do it.Chu Liuyue opened her eyes and muttered, \u201cThe force of the lake is covering mine\u2026\u201dBased solely on her current ability, she had no way to fight off the lake\u2019s influence over her body.This is pressing! What on earth is this lake? Chu Liuyue was sure that the lake was not deadly to her. It would even protect and save her in times of danger. However, would she be stuck at this stage forever if she did not figure this out?Chu Liuyue looked towards her hand. She clearly remembered that a strange pattern had appeared on her palm when she first regained consciousness after her rebirth.The pattern disappeared later, and a transparent but torn book page appeared in her dantian. The book page became the floating lake in the end.The last time the lake reacted was when she restored her Yuan meridian.Chu Liuyue initially did not pay much attention to it, but she did not expect it to get in her way of forming a pearl of essence!Chu Liuyue tried a few more times after this, but it all ended in failure.The incessant sound of the rain outside the window frustrated her.\u201cWhat lousy thing is this?!\u201d Right after she spoke, Chu Liuyue immediately felt a tremble in her dantian!A scary force burst out from the lake!Chu Liuyue\u2019s body shook suddenly, and energy rose in her chest!She stabilized herself and quickly observed her dantian! She was stunned by what she saw.The floating lake was rapidly transforming into a transparent book page! It was the book page that she had seen previously, but a red light was rapidly gathering on the page this time!Chu Liuyue\u2019s heart was in her heart. What does the sudden change mean?The red light on the page was gradually coming together to form a\u2026Word?!Chu Liuyue concentrated her energy and scrutinized it carefully.At this time, a second word appeared!Chu Liuyue finally saw the words on the page clearly\u2014\u201dDumb, dumb!\u201dChu Liuyue was speechless. She did not expect the first words this transparent book page formed to be\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re insulting me?\u201d Chu Liuyue asked in disbelief.The book page trembled, and the words swiftly disappeared. However, Chu Liuyue\u2019s shock did not dissipate.After what happened last time, she had speculated that the book page was a broken treasure, but she was not sure what it was exactly.It now seemed that the book page had its own consciousness!Chu Liuyue suppressed her surprise and coldly asked, \u201cWhat exactly are you?!\u201d She felt a little unsettled about having something like this in her dantian.A new line of text soon appeared on the book page: \u201cThe pearl of essence concentrates the Heaven and Earth powers. One scoop will overflow.\u201dChu Liuyue froze. Does that mean my pearl of essence does not have enough Heaven and Earth Force? However, isn\u2019t that normal?Countless cultivators exist. If one\u2019s pearl of essence held an unlimited amount of concentrated Heaven and Earth Force, won\u2019t things be in chaos? Besides, one\u2019s pearl of essence will get stronger as the cultivator levels up. It will carry more energy then! It is not a one-off thing!As if reading her mind, the line of text disappeared, which was replaced by a new one: \u201cDumb beyond repair!\u201dChu Liuyue was speechless. Even in both her past and present lives, this was the first time she had been insulted like this.Before she could say anything, the line of text had disappeared. Even the book page had transformed back into the floating lake. It seemed like the other party was ignoring her\u2026Chu Liuyue stared at the floating lake as she fell into deep thought. What does that line mean? One scoop of the pearl of essence will overflow\u2026 Could it be that it is saying that my pearl of essence can contain more Heaven and Earth Force?At this thought, Chu Liuyue had an idea. She began to feel the force contained in the lake.Vast and ethereal!Chu Liuyue held her breath and carefully tried to guide the energy, and a ripple cut through the surface of the lake.Hong!In an instant, a scary burst of energy flew out from the lake and traveled towards Chu Liuyue\u2019s limbs!Chu Liuyue suddenly opened her eyes and pointed one finger straight ahead!Bang!The door broke into pieces!Liked it?

Just now\u2026 All I did was create a small ripple in the lake. Where did the explosive power come from?!At this moment, a figure dashed in from outside. \u201cYue\u2019er!\u201dChu Liuyue instinctively followed the voice. It was Rong Xiu.He had clearly rushed over when he heard the door breaking.A thought flashed across her mind. My room is quite a distance from here; how did he rush over so quickly?Rong Xiu glanced at the door before he hurried in. \u201cAre you okay? What happened?\u201d He realized that Chu Liuyue was okay the instant he stepped in. He was relieved, but he could not put his mind at ease.Chu Liuyue paused. His usually lazy voice had hints of anxiety.Upon closer inspection, one could see an indiscernible look of worry between his eyes. This was rare for Rong Xiu, who usually kept a poker face.Chu Liuyue shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I just had a mishap while trying to form a pearl of essence. I didn\u2019t control the force well.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Rong Xiu looked at her suspiciously. How did forming a pearl of essence create such a big commotion?Chu Liuyue knew that her explanation was a little preposterous. Not even a stage-three warrior could wield the amount of strength from just now!But that was the truth\u2026Chu Liuyue rubbed her glabella helplessly. \u201cI\u2019m really fine. Please don\u2019t worry, Your Highness.\u201dXue Xue rushed in from outside at this point and leaped over to Chu Liuyue\u2019s side. It sniffed around as if afraid that something was wrong with Chu Liuyue.Chu Liuyue was tickled by the fur at the top of its head, and she laughed. \u201cOkay, okay! Xue Xue, I\u2019m fine! I\u2019m not hurt!\u201dXue Xue blinked. When it saw that Chu Liuyue was really okay, it rubbed against her neck as if asking for attention.Rong Xiu glanced at Xue Xue.Xue Xue stiffened immediately. It roared deeply and obediently stepped aside, lying on the floor.Chu Liuyue rubbed its head and looked at Rong Xiu. \u201cYour Highness, how did you get here so quickly?\u201d she asked strangely.Xue Xue was a high-level fiend, and it was from the lion family, so it traveled fast. It must have started to make its way here when it heard the commotion, but it still lagged behind Rong Xiu.\u201c\u2026 Could it be that you were nearby?\u201dRong Xiu could not help but laugh when he saw the girl\u2019s gaze turn suspicious towards him. He pinched her face. \u201cDon\u2019t go imagining things. I was just taking a stroll since I couldn\u2019t sleep. I headed over when I heard the commotion.\u201dChu Liuyue pulled his hand away, but she did not believe it.Such a coincidence? Besides, even if you were taking a walk nearby, I still remember how fast you moved when you came over. This sickly Prince Li is masterful at hiding things\u2026Chu Liuyue did not continue asking and instead said, \u201cYour Highness, it was a false alarm. Please, go back and rest.\u201dRong Xiu looked at the broken door pointedly. \u201cYou sure you won\u2019t tear the place down if I leave?\u201dChu Liuyue was speechless. There really is no way to explain this, is there?\u201cJust continue to form your pearl of essence. I\u2019ll just be here, and I won\u2019t get in your way.\u201d With that said, Rong Xiu sat down on a chair in the corner of the room. He picked up a book to read as if he did not intend to leave.Chu Liuyue was speechless. One clearly can\u2019t win if they fight this guy over the thickness of their skin?Whatever! The lake is in my dantian. There is no way outsiders will know about it. The most they will feel is the explosive power contained within it. All that can be explained with a pearl of essence as well.Hang on! A thought suddenly surged into Chu Liuyue\u2019s mind, and she finally understood what the book page\u2019s sentence meant. It was telling me to use it as the pearl of essence?!Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78: My LordPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euHaving connected the dots, Chu Liuyue found everything much clearer now!The blast from earlier had proven that she could in fact employ the force within the lake and that its powers were the same as that of a pearl of essence! She also learned that the lake carried energy several times stronger than that of the pearl of essence!Just a ripple was enough to trigger an explosive force. If she put in all her force, she could trigger an even mightier attack!Forming a pearl of essence was not necessary as long as this thing remained in her dantian.The only solution was to treat the lake as her pearl of essence!However, there was one problem\u2014this thing had a consciousness of its own. It clearly didn\u2019t listen to her orders completely. If she was not careful with it, it could create a lot of problems!At this time, Chu Liuyue suddenly felt an anomaly in her body. She concentrated and looked towards her dantian.The lake was gradually transforming into a giant water droplet that had a strange pattern on it!It was the pattern that had initially appeared on Chu Liuyue\u2019s palm!In that instant, Chu Liuyue felt a strange connection between herself and the droplet! It was as if the droplet had become a part of her body!Chu Liuyue used her mind to try and deploy some of the droplet\u2019s strength.A ripple\u2014much weaker than the one before\u2014appeared, and force traveled through her body.Chu Liuyue could clearly sense that she had much better control over the force this time because of her connection with the droplet.It was like it was a part of her!She experimented a few more times and finally confirmed that she had formed some kind of relationship with the water droplet!A vast but ethereal voice echoed in her head as if it were a voice from ancient times! \u201cThree thousand worlds, chaotic heavens. My lord will prevail!\u201d\u2026After hearing this voice, Chu Liuyue could not regain her senses for a while.The words were arrogant beyond belief!She had seen many strong warriors in her past life, but none of them dared say anything like this!Mainland Xuan Wu was boundless and had countless tribes. Who could emerge at the top!Besides, it said \u2018my lord!\u2019Was that not referring to her?This was a little preposterous\u2026As the voice faded, only the giant water droplet remained suspended in her dantian as if everything that had just happened was an illusion.Chu Liuyue wanted to overlook that statement but found that the voice was imprinted in her head.She waited for a while, then decided not to think about it.Since this thing decided to recognize me as its master, it won\u2019t harm me. If that is the case, I will use it as a pearl of essence for now! It took the shape of a lake earlier, and it probably became a water droplet because it formally recognized me as its master.Chu Liuyue still remembered the tiny drop of water from the lake that sent an enormous amount of energy across her body when she was repairing her Yuan meridian.Her ownership of the Dijing Yuan meridian seemed to be the result of that drop of water.However, that drop of water was not even one-thousandth of the water droplet in her dantian!At this point, red ripples suddenly appeared on the water droplet!The water droplet seemed to be wrapped in a clear membrane, on which the red ripples were inscribed. The water droplet was flowing, but the membrane remained still.In this state, the water droplet resembled a pearl of essence.For regular cultivators, their pearl of essence would change as they advanced to the next stages.For stage-one warriors, one single line would be present on their pearl of essence.For stage-two warriors, two lines would be present., and so on and so forth.Chu Liuyue solemnly thought as she stared at the water droplet. Other than the fact that its form is slightly different, this thing resembles a pearl of essence. Oh right, it has a consciousness of its own.However, that is much more convenient for me anyway.But\u2026 Why is there only one line present?No matter what, I have a \u2018pearl of essence\u2019 now! Given my ability, I should be a stage-three warrior! However, why is there only one line?!Indignant, Chu Liuyue tried to add another line to it, but the water droplet did not even react.While staring at the line, Chu Liuyue finally realized something. Does the water droplet think I\u2019m not capable enough for a second line?\u201cAre you looking down on me?\u201d asked Chu Liuyue in disbelief. \u201cI should have two lines at least, right?!\u201dWhy am I stuck with just one line? After all that fuss, I\u2019m just a stage-one warrior?The water droplet did not react, but Chu Liuyue felt despised.She glared at the water droplet for a while. In the end, she could only open her eyes in exasperation!\u201cEn? You\u2019re done forming the pearl of essence?\u201d Rong Xiu noticed her movements and looked over immediately. With one look, he could sense the aura emanating from Chu Liuyue. She\u2019s\u2026 a stage-one warrior?!Rong Xiu\u2019s expression was a little stiff, and he eyed Chu Liuyue for a while before asking with uncertainty, \u201cYou\u2026 Are you sure you\u2019re not going to continue breaking through?\u201dGiven her ability, she should definitely be above stage one.Chu Liuyue gritted her teeth. How could she admit that she could not add a second line to her \u2018pearl of essence?\u2019\u201cBeing a stage-one warrior is pretty good! It helps me keep a low profile!\u201dRong Xiu had a wry smile. \u201cYou wreaked havoc in Tian Lu Academy and the Imperial City. However, you\u2019re now thinking of keeping a low profile? Didn\u2019t you say that you wanted to hold a banquet to celebrate?\u201dChu Liuyue huffed. \u201cThat goes without saying!\u201dNot only did she want to break off her relations with the Chu family, but she was also going to make them pay for all their insults and mockery!Rong Xiu could not help but laugh when he saw her pouting. \u201cIt seems like Yue\u2019er is going to treat me to a good show.\u201dLiked it?

Even though the rain has stopped, you\u2019ll easily get sick if you go out now, right?\u201dRong Xiu could not help but smile slightly when he heard her tease him. \u201cThis study is no longer suitable for accommodation. Unless, you want to sleep in the same room as me?\u201dChu Liuyue grunted. She completely turned a deaf ear to Rong Xiu\u2019s teasing. \u201cYou\u2019re free to go whenever you want, Your Highness. Suit yourself.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll come and visit you another day,\u201d said Rong Xiu as he turned to leave.Xue Xue looked at Chu Liuyue before reluctantly following after Rong Xiu hurriedly.\u201cYour Highness, there are puddles outside. You\u2014\u201d Chu Liuyue was just about to remind him when her eyes suddenly widened.Rong Xiu stepped on the water surface like a light feather falling down without getting his foot dirty at all.Upon closer inspection, she could see that there was a narrow gap between the bottom of his foot and the water surface.He is walking on air! Only a stage-five warrior and stronger can do this! Chu Liuyue was stunned when she saw this scene.Rong Xiu was only around 16 or 17 this year, but his capabilities had already reached such a shocking level.Weaking? Everyone has underestimated this mysterious Prince Li. Chu Liuyue had never underestimated Rong Xiu, but she did not expect him to be a stage-five warrior at least.His talent was considered outstanding, even in Tianling Dynasty.Just when Chu Liuyue was shocked speechless, the man and the fiend had already disappeared into the night sky.\u2026Chu Liuyue returned to her own bedroom in the latter half of the night.When Chu Liuyue saw the black cloak by the bed, she suddenly realized that Rong Xiu had forgotten to take it away.Chu Liuyue frowned in contempt but still kept the cloak in the end. She even planned on finding some time to return it to him.She quickly fell into a deep slumber after she lay down, largely because of the many happenings in the day.\u2026After Rong Xiu left the mansion, he walked on the marble path and turned around the corner.Right after, someone hurriedly went forward and said, \u201cGreetings, Master!\u201dIt was Yan Qing.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d asked Rong Xiu lightly.\u201cMaster, Chuan Qiong just sent us some news saying that Jiuyou Tower has strange movements,\u201d said Yan Qing while panting and wiping off the beads of sweat on his forehead.If it were not something urgent, Yan Qing wouldn\u2019t have dared to contact his master at this time. However, this matter could not be delayed.Chuan Qiong was a teacher at Tian Lu Academy. Even though he was very experienced, he usually kept a low profile. Nobody knew he worked for Rong Xiu.Tian Lu Academy had an extraordinary status. Even the royal family did not dare to mess with them. Nobody would expect that Rong Xiu\u2014who had been out of the city for many years\u2014had actually planted a spy in Tian Lu Academy a long time ago.Chuan Qiong had been in the academy for many years and never contacted them before. This was the first time.Thus, how would Yan Qing dare to take it slow? He hurriedly rushed over anxiously. Now, he could only secretly hope that he had not disturbed his master.\u201cMm,\u201d said Rong Xiu coldly and nodded; he did not look surprised. \u201cLet him continue observing it.\u201dYan Qing was shocked. \u201cMaster, y-you already guessed this would happen?\u201dJiuyou Tower is an important place in Tian Lu Academy. How did Master predict that it would have some strange movements today? Actually, how did he even arrange for Chuan Qiong to be there much earlier on\u2026?Xue Xue yawned at the side as if it was frustrated.Rong Xiu took a look and Xue Xue and suddenly asked, \u201cWhat has the Fourth Princess been up to lately?\u201dYan Qing said hurriedly, \u201cFourth Princess has been making a fuss lately about going to the hunting ground. She is even willing to pay an extravagant amount to do so. I heard that she asked several aristocratic children to come along to hunt for high-level fiends. They\u2019re going there tomorrow.\u201dRong Xiu replied with an \u201cMm\u201d and glanced at Xue Xue. \u201cYou must let Fourth Princess have a good time.\u201dXue Xue licked its paws, and its icy blue eyes sparkled coldly.\u201cMaster, your cloak\u2026\u201d Master always wears a cloak when he goes out. Why is it missing?Rong Xiu turned around, and the dark night sky blurred the outlines of the dark-green house. \u201cI\u2019ll come back and take it tomorrow.\u201dLiked it?

Didn\u2019t the Emperor say that he wanted to talk to you throughout the night? Did you come right back home after it ended?\u201dChu Ning looked at her dotingly. \u201cHurry up, come here and eat. I actually came back at midnight. However, I saw you asleep, so I didn\u2019t wake you up.\u201dChu Liuyue sat down beside him and could not help but tease when she saw the piping hot breakfast. \u201cDad, you\u2019re already the imperial guards\u2019 Commander in Chief. This meal is so precious!\u201dChu Ning raised his hand, seeming like he wanted to pat her head. However, he paused in his actions, retracted his hand, and sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re the most precious person to me. Yesterday was the day you reached marriageable age, so I intended to come home right away after talking to the Emperor. However, I didn\u2019t expect to talk to him for so long, and it even rained. That\u2019s why I came home so late.\u201dChu Liuyue\u2019s heart felt warm. \u201cFather, you already made longevity noodles for me yesterday. That was enough.\u201dChu Ning shook his head, looking regretful and apologetic. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity I can\u2019t hold a grand banquet for you.\u201d\u201cFather, you becoming the imperial guards\u2019 Commander in Chief is already the best gift to me. Besides, I\u2019m more than happy because you allowed me to sever ties with the Chu family.\u201dChu Ning was different from her as he had feelings for the Chu family. However, when he heard her say that, he agreed after keeping silent for a while.\u201cIn the past, we were in a very difficult position. Leaving the Chu family would only make it worse, but everything is different now. We don\u2019t need to stay there anymore.\u201d Chu Ning smiled, and his face filled with pride. \u201cHowever, I didn\u2019t realize that your Yuan meridian had recovered and that you also had so much Xuan Master talent. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve already asked my subordinates to send out the invitation cards. We\u2019ll hold a banquet at Ying Bin Restaurant this afternoon to celebrate.\u201dIt was more than simple for him to do such things. After all, his current identity was different; he had also recovered his previous connections and resources.\u201cYue\u2019er, how many tables do you think we should have? I told Zhao Ming to book ten tables. Will that be enough?\u201dChu Liuyue held up a bowl of porridge. \u201cYou can decide.\u201d\u201cThen, we\u2019ll have ten tables first. We can add more if they aren\u2019t enough.\u201dAt this moment, a man wearing imperial guard armor walked in through the door. \u201cGreetings, Commander.\u201d\u201cZhao Ming, have you settled the matter with Ying Bin Restaurant?\u201d asked Chu Ning while smiling.Zhao Ming seemed hesitant. \u201cCommander, Ying Bin Restaurant said that they are fully booked today and can\u2019t hold another banquet\u2026\u201dChu Ning\u2019s smile faded. \u201cWe can just change to another restaurant then. Chun Xing Restaurant is not bad.\u201dZhao Ming\u2019s head hung even lower. \u201cCommander, I have already asked Chun Xing Restaurant, and they said that they are also fully booked today. All the famous restaurants in the Imperial City said they are fully booked\u2026\u201dChu Ning already realized something. \u201cSo, all of them are not willing to let us hold a banquet?\u201dZhao Ming did not dare to speak. It wasn\u2019t only these famous restaurants; he had even gone to ask the average ones as well.Initially, they were all very polite when they heard that Zhao Ming wanted to hold a banquet. However, once they heard that the hosts were Chu Ning and Chu Liuyue, they rejected him and avoided him like he was a scorpion.Everybody\u2019s reactions were very similar, as if they had discussed it in advance.Chu Ning\u2019s face turned cold, and he gradually clenched his fists. The Chu family is obviously stirring up trouble. They are purposely humiliating us.\u2026The Chu family estate.\u201cMy pitiful Minmin! Chu Liuyue is too cruel to hurt you to this state.\u201d Lu Yao almost fainted when she saw Chu Xianmin\u2019s appearance when Chu Xianmin returned home the previous day.Even after a night, she still trembled in anger when she talked about this.Chu Xianmin lay on the bed hopelessly, her face as white as a sheet. Her entire person looked much frailer than before.Shattered glass pieces from a mirror were scattered beside her bed.Her eyes did not focus as she kept muttering, \u201cMy face\u2026 My face\u2026\u201dShe started crying again when she talked about it. \u201cMother, my face is ruined! The Crown Prince won\u2019t want me anymore! It\u2019s all Chu Liuyue\u2019s fault! That b*tch deserves to die!\u201dLu Yao went forward and hugged Chu Xianmin dotingly as she ground her teeth. \u201cMinmin, your face will get better. I\u2019ll definitely help you. I won\u2019t let Chu Liuyue off the hook.\u201dChu Yan\u2014who had a darkened face since the start\u2014finally shouted in frustration. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. What\u2019s the point of crying? Your face doesn\u2019t amount to anything. The point is that she crushed your talent.\u201dChu Xianmin trembled, and her tears dropped even quicker.Chu Xianmin was still his daughter in the end, so Chu Yan held himself back and suppressed the anger in his heart. He then said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take revenge for you. Neither Chu Liuyue nor Chu Ning can play any tricks this time round. Weren\u2019t they very happy yesterday and even said they wanted to hold a banquet to celebrate? I want to see which restaurant will dare to go against the Chu family and allow them to host a banquet. With no backing, it won\u2019t be easy for them to make a name out of themselves in the Imperial City.\u201dChu Xianmin clutched the corner of her sleeves in indignance. \u201cHowever, Chu Ning is already the imperial guards\u2019 Commander in Chief, and Chu Liuyue became a genius. Even if they can\u2019t hold this banquet, next time\u2014\u201dLu Yao sneered. \u201cThey might not even have a next time.\u201d\u2026\u201cFather, don\u2019t bother asking. All these restaurants in the Imperial City have clearly received some \u2018hints.\u2019 Even if they didn\u2019t, a sensible person wouldn\u2019t go against the Chu family.\u201d Chu Liuyue finished her porridge calmly and wiped the corner of her mouth.Chu Ning\u2019s brows knitted tightly. He said that he wanted to hold a celebration for her, but he could not do it.If word got out, he would become the Imperial City\u2019s laughingstock.\u201cThen, what should we do now?\u201d Chu Ning was not willing to let his daughter suffer any more grievances. \u201cIf it really can\u2019t work, I\u2019ll go personally\u2014\u201d I\u2019m still the imperial guards\u2019 Commander in Chief. They can\u2019t possibly not give me any face.Chu Liuyue pressed his shoulders and shook her head. \u201cFather, you don\u2019t need to show yourself. Everyone is watching us now. If you do this, everyone will think that we\u2019ve lost at the start.\u201d\u201cShould we just let it go, then?\u201d\u201cNo, we need to wait.\u201d\u201cWait?\u201d\u201cThe banquet isn\u2019t important. The important thing is the people attending it.\u201d Chu Liuyue looked up at the sky. \u201cThere are still three hours left to the stated time. Let\u2019s see if anyone will come.\u201dLiked it?

One look at his sly-looking appearance made people unhappy.\u201cYou are?\u201dThe person didn\u2019t seem to expect that Zhao Ming would be the one who opened the door.

Pui!\u201d The pageboy climbed up and became even more arrogant. \u201cDidn\u2019t she say that she was holding a celebratory banquet today? Tsk tsk, why isn\u2019t anyone here yet? It\u2019s so quiet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not quiet at all with a lost dog barking wildly.\u201d A cold woman\u2019s voice sounded.Chu Liuyue and Chu Ning heard the commotion and walked over.Zhao Ming hurriedly said, \u201cCommander, Big Missy, this person came here to stir trouble. I\u2019ll chase him away right now.\u201dChu Liuyue raised her hand and looked at the pageboy with much interest. \u201cWhy? Is the Chu family so useless that they don\u2019t even dare to come themselves?\u201dThe pageboy\u2019s face flushed red. \u201cWho are you calling a dog?\u201dChu Liuyue shrugged her shoulders. \u201cWhoever is the one barking.\u201dThe pageboy was stumped. His eyes turned, and he laughed coldly. \u201cHmph, didn\u2019t you say you were holding a banquet yesterday? It\u2019s already so late, yet both of you are still at home. Oh no\u2026 Could it be that you don\u2019t have a place to hold the banquet? Do you intend to host your guests in such a rotten mansion? No, I think nobody would even come. Hahaha!\u201dChu Ning\u2019s face darkened. \u201cI think you don\u2019t want your mouth anymore.\u201dA chill ran down the pageboy\u2019s spine as he backed away in fear.I heard that Chu Ning has already recovered his stage-five warrior cultivation, and his aura is indeed different. However\u2026 so what? Nobody dares to do business with this father-daughter duo in the entire Imperial City. They don\u2019t even have a restaurant that is willing to host them.He shrugged his shoulders and teased, \u201cOh my, Officer Chu Ning you\u2019re currently the imperial guards\u2019 Commander in Chief; you won\u2019t hold it against a mere servant like me, right? Besides, I came here to help you. First Elder told me to tell you that there\u2019s still a way if you can\u2019t find a place to host the banquet.\u201d\u201cThe Chu family has several restaurants. If you\u2019re willing, First Elder won\u2019t mind lending you the place, ignoring whatever happened before. He will even give you a discount. What do you think?\u201dThey were riding all over him!\u201cOfficer Chu Ning, don\u2019t be upset. First Elder just wants to help you. Look, yesterday you said you were going to hold a banquet. If you don\u2019t have a location today\u201d\u2014the pageboy hit his face\u2014\u201dwhat do you think will become of your status as the Commander in Chief?\u201dChu Ning\u2019s blood boiled, and he gathered force into his palms. He was going to deal with this pageboy straight away.Someone walked over from not far away. \u201cMay I ask if this is Ms. Chu Liuyue\u2019s residence?\u201dThe few people all turned around to look at him.The person who just spoke was a slightly chubby middle-aged man and looked very harmonious when he smiled.Chu Liuyue nodded. \u201cThis is my house. May I know who\u2014\u201dThat man was slightly taken aback and smiled even friendlier afterward. \u201cSo you are Ms. Liuyue. Apologies for not recognizing you earlier. I\u2019m Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s manager\u2014Su Hui.\u201dEveryone was shocked when he introduced himself.Phoenix Restaurant was an old store with a long history in the Imperial City and was very famous. Rumor had it that Phoenix Restaurant had three bests\u2014best taste, best price, and best appearance.The taste need not be mentioned since everyone who had been there only had praises for the food. Of course, the food was not something an average person could afford. Even some aristocratic children could not afford to eat there.In terms of appearance, Phoenix Restaurant overflowed with elegance from top to bottom and inside to outside. It was also known as the top view in the Imperial City.Phoenix Restaurant was definitely the best restaurant in the Imperial City because of these. Ying Bin Restaurant and the rest could not even be compared to it.However, why did Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s manager come here?\u201cYou\u2019re here for\u2026\u201d\u201cI heard that Ms. Liuyue wants to host a banquet. May I know if Phoenix Restaurant can have the honor of being the venue?\u201dThe surroundings fell into deep silence.Chu Liuyue blinked. \u201cYou mean\u2026 you\u2019re willing to host this banquet?\u201dSu Hui bent his back slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s my honor.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dChu Liuyue really did not expect that Phoenix Restaurant would take the initiative to help them after she was rejected by all the restaurants in the Imperial City.Even Chu Ning could not stay calm. \u201cManager Su, are you serious? I thought the banquets at Phoenix Restaurant had to be booked one month in advance? There won\u2019t be space if we go there now, right?\u201d He did not dare say this about other places, but Phoenix Restaurant would definitely be packed to the brim.Su Hui smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Officer Chu Ning. Phoenix Restaurant has already cleared our place today, and we\u2019ll only serve Ms. Liuyue.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSu Hui\u2019s words sounded like thunder in the few people\u2019s ears, and they could not recover from their shock.Chu Liuyue was the first to react. Did\u2026 someone save me from this mess? The point is, who did? I don\u2019t have any friends or backing in the Imperial City, and I even offended a bunch of people.Who exactly is willing to risk offending the Chu family to help me? That\u2019s not right. That person must come from a formidable background and has strong capabilities to get Phoenix Restaurant to do this, so why will he fear the Chu family?\u201cManager Su, are you sure you want to help them? I heard a cup of tea starts from 500 silver taels. I\u2019m afraid these two people aren\u2019t able to afford the banquet. Are you sure you want to do a losing business?\u201d That pageboy did not expect someone from Phoenix Restaurant would come, and he was stunned. However, he refused to admit defeat on the surface and continued talking arrogantly.Upon hearing this, Su Hui did not even look at him and smiled at Chu Liuyue instead. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ms. Liuyue. Today\u2019s expenses have already been paid.\u201d\u201cWho did it?\u201d\u201cSecond Master Yan.\u201dSecond Master Yan? Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2019s Yan Ge\u2026?\u201cDidn\u2019t you know? A high-level fiend appeared in the hunting ground you sold to them a few days ago. To express his gratitude, Second Master Yan specifically booked Phoenix Restaurant for you. He will also come and celebrate with you today.\u201d\u201cOfficer Chu Ning and Ms. Liuyue, please\u2014\u201dLiked it?

Many people were on the streets, and it was very lively.Su Hui smiled and pointed to the front. \u201cIt\u2019s the place in front.\u201dUpon looking in the direction he was pointing at, Chu Liuyue saw a traditional two-story restaurant and could vaguely see the two words \u2018Phoenix Restaurant\u2019 on the plaque.She was slightly shocked. Every inch of ground was worth gold in this place. Even the rental price for a small shop was ridiculous. How can Phoenix Restaurant only have two floors as the top restaurant in the Imperial City?Chu Liuyue casually scanned her surroundings. Even the neighboring clothes shop had three stories.Phoenix Restaurant really looked much more low-key in comparison.Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s doors were tightly shut as two pageboys stood in front of the building.A few people were at the door and speaking to the pageboy.\u201cClosed? Phoenix Restaurant normally closes at the end of the month, right? Why are you closed so suddenly today?\u201dThe pageboy politely said, \u201cSorry Sirs, we\u2019re only listening to our manager\u2019s commands. I seek your kind forgiveness.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not over just because you apologized. I already made a deal with my brothers to gather here today. How dare you tell me this? It will be so embarrassing for me.\u201dThe few people looked like young masters that were very rich. The leader of the pack looked very frustrated, and his words were arrogant.Chu Liuyue looked over and realized the person talking seemed familiar.\u201cTell your manager to come out. How dare Phoenix Restaurant not care about the Lu family\u2019s reputation?\u201dOh, so it\u2019s him, Lu family\u2019s Fourth Young Master\u2014Lu Zhitao.The pageboy matter-of-factly said, \u201cWe won\u2019t entertain any guests today. Please, come another day. If not, there are many restaurants in the Imperial City, and you can just change to another one.\u201d\u201cHow is it the same?\u201d Lu Zhitao raised his voice. \u201cHow do you do your business? How can you chase your customers away? Do you believe I\u2019ll\u2014\u201dSu Hui stepped forward. \u201cYoung Master, I\u2019m really sorry about it.\u201dLu Zhitao turned around and knitted his brows. \u201cWho are you?\u201dThe two pageboys immediately bowed. \u201cManager.\u201dSu Hui nodded.Lu Zhitao and the rest looked at each other and were slightly shocked. They did not expect the seemingly harmonious fatty to be Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s manager.Phoenix Restaurant was very famous, but only a handful of people could see the manager. Thus, they still did not know Su Hui, even though they had come a few times.\u201cSo you\u2019re Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s manager. You\u2019ve come at the right time. You\u2019ve seen what happened earlier, right? We\u2019re considered regulars at Phoenix Restaurant, so how can you treat us like this?\u201d Lu Zhitao still sounded very aggressive.The people behind tugged him and softly said, \u201cFourth Young Master, Phoenix Restaurant is not simple. We should be polite\u2026\u201dLu Zhitao still smiled coldly. \u201cIt\u2019s just a restaurant. How powerful can it be? My Lu family also does business, but we\u2019ve never chased customers away so directly. Why, can the top restaurant in the Imperial City not care about their customers?\u201dHis voice was very loud, quickly attracting the surrounding people\u2019s attention.A few people gradually started to gather around. Some of them were watching the commotion while others were enjoying the show.Lu Zhitao felt even more justified.Su Hui cupped his fists. \u201cPhoenix Restaurant wouldn\u2019t dare to claim the title of the Imperial City\u2019s top restaurant, but someone has already booked the entire Phoenix Restaurant today. Thus, we\u2019re really sorry for the inconvenience today. I seek your understanding on this.\u201dOnce he said that, the crowd\u2019s faces instantly changed at the same time.B-book the whole place?Booked the entire Phoenix Restaurant?How much would that cost?Who is so extravagant?Lu Zhitao\u2019s anger was reduced by half as he clearly knew that it was not easy to book the entire Phoenix Restaurant, even for his Lu family. It was akin to burning money.The person who did such a thing\u2026 could not be offended.\u201cOh\u2026 you should\u2019ve said so earlier!\u201d Lu Zhitao exchanged glances with the people behind him. \u201cWe\u2019ll come back again tomorrow.\u201dSu Hui smiled. \u201cSorry, that person has booked the entire place for three days straight.

Young Masters, please take your leave.\u201d Su Hui turned around after saying that and clearly did not want to continue talking to them.Su Hui might not even meet the Lu family head if he came on a normal day, so it was very rare for him to be patient enough to talk to Lu Zhitao.\u201cFourth Young Master, Phoenix Restaurant can\u2019t be rifled with. We should go.\u201dAnger rose in Lu Zhitao\u2019s heart, but he became more clear-headed once he heard the reminder. Just as he was about to cower and leave, his gaze shifted and landed on the pretty young girl standing nearby.She was just standing there quietly, but she seemed to make everything around her lose its color.Lu Zhitao\u2019s eyes immediately brightened. Since when did the Imperial City have such a beautiful lady?Chu Liuyue\u2019s eyes shifted when she noticed Lu Zhitao\u2019s gaze.Lu Zhitao did not go to the Crown Prince\u2019s banquet that day. She had also disguised herself when they argued the previous time, so it was normal for him not to recognize her.\u201cOh my, whose daughter is this? Why haven\u2019t I seen you before?\u201d said Lu Zhitao as he walked over.Su Hui moved and blocked his way. Su Hui\u2019s smile had vanished from his face, and his tone was packed with warning. \u201cThis lady is Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s esteemed guest today\u2014Ms. Liuyue.\u201d\u2026\u201cWhat? They\u2019re hosting the banquet at Phoenix Restaurant? How is that possible? They can\u2019t afford it!\u201dThe entire Chu family was stunned when they heard the piece of news the pageboy brought back. \u201cI heard that Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2019s Second Master Yan booked the entire place for her as thanks for selling the hunting ground\u2019s title deed.\u201dChu Yan was so furious that his teeth were itchy. Everything was going well until Yan Ge appeared out of nowhere.\u201cI also heard that high-level fiends have appeared in the hunting ground recently, so the price surged drastically. Fourth Princess is also going to bring a few people over today.\u201d\u201cThis Chu Liuyue is so lucky. Even though she lost her marriage agreement with the Crown Prince after selling the hunting ground, she won Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2019s liking.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of place is Zhen Bao Pavilion? Would they look at Chu Liuyue differently just because of a mere hunting ground? I think something must be up behind the scenes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not the time to talk about this now. We should think of what to do next. The news about Zhen Bao Pavilion standing up for Chu Liuyue is probably spreading like wildfire around the Imperial City. Some might even go and support Chu Liuyue and her father because of Zhen Bao Pavilion.\u201dFirst Elder\u2019s face darkened, and he suddenly laughed coldly. \u201cHmph, this incident isn\u2019t so simple. Zhen Bao Pavilion snatched the Crown Prince\u2019s belongings. Now that high-level fiends have appeared in the hunting ground, the Crown Prince will only hate Zhen Bao Pavilion even more. He might not do anything to Zhen Bao Pavilion, but he will definitely push the blame to Chu Liuyue. The people who go to the banquet today aren\u2019t only going against us but offending the Crown Prince as well. I want to see who will intentionally get involved in this mess.\u201d\u2026Chu Liuyue walked into Phoenix Restaurant and discovered that the place was huge, even though there were only two floors.Upon walking in, she realized that there was an annulus level apart from the main hall.A clear pond sat in the middle of the building. The pond was surrounded by borders carved from agarwood, exuding a light fragrance in the entire Phoenix Restaurant that refreshed one\u2019s heart.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Officer Chu Ning and Ms. Liuyue, I\u2019ve already sent out the news about the banquet venue changing to Phoenix Restaurant. You can just wait here peacefully.\u201dChu Liuyue was secretly touched that he had done so much. The other party was clearly prepared and settled everything for her.Chu Ning could not help but say, \u201cYue\u2019er, we must thank Second Master Yan properly this time.\u201dChu Liuyue nodded. In actual fact, she also wanted to ask Second Master Yan some questions.At this time, a voice sounded from the outside. \u201cSecond Master Yan is here!\u201dSpeak of the devil.Chu Liuyue and the rest turned around and saw Yan Ge walking towards them.She did not expect Yan Ge to be the first to arrive. According to his identity, it was already very rare for him to come personally, not to mention this early.Chu Liuyue suppressed her surprise and welcomed him with a smile and bow. \u201cSecond Master Yan.\u201dOnce Yan Ge saw this, his heart skipped a beat, and he hurriedly moved behind. \u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201dChu Liuyue glanced at him curiously and noticed that he looked rather anxious and a little\u2026 restrained. He seemed very different from the delightful and calm Second Master Yan she first met. \u201cSecond Master Yan, what happened to you?\u201dYan Ge tried hard to pretend to be calm, and his mouth curved up unnaturally. \u201cN-nothing much. Ms. Liuyue entering Tian Lu Academy is a very happy incident. I came here to celebrate with you.\u201dChu Liuyue\u2019s eyes curved up like crescent moons. \u201cYour gift is too much.\u201dYan Ge waved his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing much! Nothing much! I even brought some gifts for you; they\u2019re outside.\u201dChu Liuyue casually scanned her surroundings and saw quite a few boxes outside. The corner of her eyes twitched. He\u2019s giving gifts in boxes?\u201cSecond Master Yan, you\u2019re too kind\u2026\u201dYan Ge forced a smile.I only gave 300,000 silver taels for the title deed of Master\u2019s wife\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be digging my own grave if I knew of this earlier.Liked it?

Ms. Liuyue, you must accept it.\u201dChu Liuyue was silent as she stared at the gift boxes piled into a hill outside.Small gift\u2026 Does Yan Ge have a misunderstanding of this term? Or does he think that Zhen Bao Pavilion has too much money?But Chu Liuyue could only accept them in the end. Considering Yan Ge\u2019s determined expression, she would be looking down on him if she didn\u2019t accept them. \u201cThen, I can only accept your goodwill respectfully.\u201dYan Ge finally heaved a sigh of relief in his heart when she finally accepted it. Only God knew that his soul was almost frightened away when he heard that his master was choosing presents for Chu Liuyue.He never thought that his master\u2019s rumored missus would be Chu family\u2019s Big Missy\u2014the one he had recently struck a deal with\u2014Chu Liuyue.\u201cThat\u2019s great! That\u2019s great! I didn\u2019t expect Ms. Liuyue to have such outstanding talent. You really surprised me.\u201dThis was the truth. Who would have thought that Chu Liuyue\u2014whom everyone thought was a good-for-nothing\u2014could actually enter Tian Lu Academy and attain such great results?With Chu Liuyue\u2019s talent and forbearance, it was no wonder his master\u2014who did not care much for girls\u2014was attracted to her.Yan Ge had dealt with Chu Liuyue before during the hunting ground business deal, and he had admired her quite a bit. Now that he knew she was the apple of his master\u2019s eye, his attitude was naturally even better.He looked at Chu Ning and sighed emotionally. \u201cI heard that you\u2019ve completely recovered, and you\u2019re now the imperial guards\u2019 Commander in Chief. I haven\u2019t congratulated you yet.\u201d\u201cSecond Master Yan, you\u2019re too kind.\u201d Chu Ning walked forward and looked at Chu Liuyue lovingly. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my Yue\u2019er\u2026\u201d He paused and did not continue.Even though Yue\u2019er passed all three examinations and entered Tian Lu Academy, her most outstanding achievements were her placing second in the Xuan Master assessment, followed by first place in the warrior assessment. Nobody seemed to mention her heavenly doctor talent.She also did not participate in the heavenly doctor assessment, nor did she perform ideally in that category during the entrance examination since she passed it forcefully.Chu Ning originally thought that she would enter as a heavenly doctor, but it seemed like she was hiding her talent on purpose. Even though he did not know the reason, Yue\u2019er definitely had her reasons for doing so.At the very least, she had a trump card up her sleeves.Chu Liuyue smiled and said, \u201cWhat are you talking about, Father? We\u2019ve relied on each other for so many years, and we have finally made it past the bad days. It\u2019s my blessing to have you with me.\u201dChu Ning\u2019s tears started welling up. \u201cYue\u2019er is right! Today, we should celebrate properly! Second Master Yan, please head inside.\u201d\u2018Inside\u2019 definitely meant the more central location.Yan Ge personally attending the banquet meant that Zhen Bao Pavilion was willing to stand up for the father-daughter duo. It was really rare for Zhen Bao Pavilion to do so with their current status in the Imperial City.\u201cHaha, Officer Chu Ning and Ms. Liuyue are the true hosts today. You two should head in first,\u201d answered Yan Ge with a smile, but his gaze shifted to Chu Liuyue subconsciously. What a joke! How would I dare to walk in front of Master\u2019s missus?Chu Liuyue discovered that Second Master Yan was really weird today. However, it was not the time to ask questions. After seeing Yan Ge\u2019s persistence, Chu Liuyue did not force him. \u201cSecond Master Yan, make yourself at home then.\u201dYan Ge immediately agreed happily.Something flashed across Chu Liuyue\u2019s mind, and she seemingly nonchalantly asked, \u201cSecond Master Yan, I heard that high-level fiends have appeared in the hunting ground. May I know what level they are?\u201dYan Ge immediately felt a bit guilty when he heard that and coughed. \u201cActually, we only found traces of high-level fiends in the hunting ground previously. We haven\u2019t seen what exactly they are yet. However\u2026 I think their levels aren\u2019t too low\u2026\u201dChu Liuyue nodded. It was rare to see high-level fiends, so it was natural for Yan Ge not to want to talk about such important things in detail.Chu Ning looked outside the door, and it seemed like nobody else came other than the people Yan Ge brought. He could not help but say, \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for booking the entire Phoenix Restaurant. I really don\u2019t know how to return the favor. However, there won\u2019t be many people coming today; I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re just wasting your money.\u201dYan Ge chuckled and did not say a word. Waste? I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t be enough!\u2026\u201cSi family\u2019s Eldest Young Master, Si Ting, is here!\u201dThe second announcement shocked the people in Phoenix Restaurant.Chu Liuyue looked up and saw a young man in a blue robe walking over.The face of the young man was sharp and handsome. He exuded a cold and distinguished aura, similar to a sharp knife. It was Si Ting!\u201cW-Why is he here?\u201d Chu Ning was surprised.As the indubitable top aristocratic family in the Imperial City, the Si family rarely interfered with other families\u2019 affairs. So, why did they send someone over this time?They had even sent Si Ting, who had the highest status amongst the Si family\u2019s younger generation.This banquet could be considered as the battle between the father-daughter duo and the Chu family. Everyone knew that they were pitting themselves against the Chu family by coming here.Logically speaking, the Si family had no need to get involved in this situation. Even if they had to choose, they would choose the Chu family. Then, why would they\u2026Si Ting had already walked over in the blink of an eye. He first bowed towards Chu Ning. \u201cGreetings, Uncle Chu.\u201dChu Ning hurriedly said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so formal, Si Ting.\u201dSi Ting exuded a faintly distinguished yet distant aura, but his gaze was calm and actions appropriate, which people would not be uncomfortable with.\u201cDid\u2026 the Si family\u2019s Master send you over?\u201d asked Chu Ning rather hesitantly.Si Ting nodded. \u201cMaster has been rather busy lately, so he can\u2019t come personally. Thus, he told me to take his place. He heard that you became a stage-five warrior, and he\u2019s very happy about it. He said that he wants to duel with you if there is time.\u201dActually, Si Ye was only a few years older than Chu Ning. Both of them had some connections before, but Chu Ning got injured later, and Si Ye became the Si family\u2019s head. Thus, they started interacting with each other less and less.With Si Ye\u2019s current status, he had no need to come over personally. It was more than enough that he sent the Si family\u2019s Eldest Young Master, Si Ting, over. This was enough to show the Si family\u2019s stance.Chu Ning was touched. \u201c\u2026 Good! Good!\u201d\u201cHowever\u2026 I came here today on behalf of my family and also myself,\u201d said Si Ting as he looked at Chu Liuyue. \u201cBig Chu Missy and I are disciples in the same Xuan Master course, so I should come over to congratulate her.\u201dThe academy was split into the three factions\u2014warrior, Xuan Master, and heavenly doctor. Originally, few people could be Xuan Masters, so they were more united and bonded.Thus, Si Ting\u2019s actions were considered normal.Chu Liuyue smiled. \u201cThank you.\u201dSi Ting felt that the young girl\u2019s smile was bedazzling, and he could not look at it directly. His heart skipped a beat, and the weird feeling from before appeared again.He nodded lightly and subconsciously looked away. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many people in the academy as we\u2019re on a break. However, Si Yang has already gone to call the others over. They\u2019ll be here in a bit.\u201d\u201cSi family\u2019s Fifth Young Master, Si Yang; Ou family\u2019s Second Young Master, Ou Zhen; Sun family\u2019s Fourth Missy, Sun Xiaoxiang; General Zhen Nan\u2019s daughter, Wu Yingying\u2026\u201dChu Liuyue looked up and saw a group of young men and women walking towards her together.The person leading the pack was Si Yang, and he was filled with excitement. \u201cPhoenix Restaurant! We must eat until Chu Liuyue becomes poor!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d replied the crowd loudly.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect her to be so powerful. I can\u2019t even eat at Phoenix Restaurant once every three months.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! I came out late for the previous assessment, so I didn\u2019t even see how she looks. I must look at her properly this time.\u201d\u201cThe second place in our Xuan Master assessment got first place in the warrior assessment. Don\u2019t you think those people were driven to their graves? Hahaha!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t fight with me later! I want to be the first to drink with her!\u201dThe lively chatter immediately made the entire Phoenix Restaurant livelier.Si Yang looked up and winked at Si Ting. \u201cBig Brother! I called everyone over! More people are still behind!\u201dSi Ting softly replied with an \u201cMm,\u201d but the hands in his sleeves gradually formed a tight fist.Chu Liuyue blinked. \u201cSi Ting, did you call them over?\u201dSi Ting nodded grimly. \u201cNot really. We\u2019re all in the same school anyway, and it\u2019s livelier with more people around.\u201dYan Ge\u2019s brows rose up high. What a lad. Is he fighting with Master?Liked it?

We\u2019re all Xuan Masters, so we\u2019re family. How can we not come to your banquet?!\u201d Si Yang did not realize that he had betrayed his brother with his words as he hopped over to Chu Liuyue and marveled at things. \u201cHowever, I\u2019ve got to say that you\u2019re really generous! You reserved the entire Phoenix Restaurant for this? This must\u2019ve cost a bomb, right?!\u201dEven he, who was the Si family\u2019s fifth young master, could not come here whenever he wanted.Chu Liuyue looked at Yan Ge. \u201cActually, I have to thank Second Master Yan from Zhen Bao Pavilion for this.\u201dSi Yang and the rest paused when they heard Chu Liuyue mention Zhen Bao Pavilion. It was only then that they saw Yan Ge, who was standing by the side.The few of them greeted him immediately. \u201cSecond Master Yan!\u201dYan Ge waved and laughed out loud. \u201cDon\u2019t stand on ceremony, everyone. Ms. Liuyue is the star today. I\u2019m just here to congratulate her on behalf of Zhen Bao Pavilion!\u201dEveryone was secretly stunned by his words.What status does Zhen Bao Pavilion hold? In the Imperial City, only a handful of people have the guts to provoke them!Rumor has it that Zhen Bao Pavilion stood the big families up last right, but they did not receive any trouble for it!Here on behalf of Zhen Bao Pavilion to congratulate her?That sounds simple, but it will be very clear that Zhen Bao Pavilion is backing Chu Liuyue up if word gets out!Si Yang and the others took another good look at Chu Liuyue.Everyone used to say that Chu Liuyue was a good-for-nothing. However, she got into Tian Lu Academy with stellar results! Even though she broke off her ties with the Chu family, she had Zhen Bao Pavilion backing her up in an instant!There is probably little to no truth in the rumors about Chu Liuyue! How many cards does she still have hidden!\u201cSi Yang, what are you waiting for? Aren\u2019t you going to introduce us?\u201d A young man by the side nudged Si Yang and gave him a look. \u201cOnly you and Si Ting met her that day. We were behind and could not catch up!\u201d\u201cCome, come! I\u2019ll introduce you all one by one. This is Ou Zhen!\u201d Si Yang returned to his senses and introduced them to Chu Liuyue one by one. Just as he finished the introductions, a few more young men and women came in from outside.Without a doubt, they were here because of Si Yang.Actually, it should be because of Si Ting.Even though they were all in the same Xuan Master class at Tian Lu Academy, their identities were not to be belittled.Most of them came from noble families. Some students came from outside the Imperial City, but they also had strong family backgrounds.After all, large amounts of resources and support were required to become a Xuan Master. Common families would not be able to afford these two things.Thus, their presence here was representative of their family\u2019s wishes.Of course, Chu Liuyue was not naive enough to believe that her status as a Xuan Master was enough to garner their support.These people were probably there on account of Si Yang and Si Ting.Especially Si Ting. His attitude was a reflection of the Si family\u2019s attitude!Si Yang was more extroverted, so he was good at livening things up.Even though Chu Liuyue did not know these people beforehand, things warmed up fast with Si Yang around.While Chu Liuyue was surprised by everyone\u2019s attendance, Yan Ge\u2019s presence stunned the rest of the people.They were there on account of Si Ting and the Si family, but they did not expect Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2019s second-in-charge to be here before them!No wonder Chu Liuyue had the courage to break off ties with the Chu family!With Zhen Bao Pavilion, the Chu family cannot act as they please!\u201cThe rooms on the second floor have been prepared. If you all would please\u2026\u201d Su Hui smiled extra graciously.Si Yang and the rest were a little surprised. \u201cRooms on the second floor? I thought they were not usually open to the public?\u201dWhen ordinary people came to Phoenix Restaurant, they could only remain on the first floor. Rumor had it that the rooms on the second floor had exorbitant prices and hard to reserve.\u201cWe usually have such a rule, but Ms. Liuyue has reserved the entire place today. Thus, it\u2019s of no problem. Everyone is classmates with Ms. Liuyue, so, of course, you all have the right to take a seat.\u201d Su Hui smiled as he bowed.Si Yang and the others looked at each other, stunned.The rooms on Phoenix Restaurant\u2019s second floor!Led by the manager!What kind of treatment is this!The youngsters were still young and unfamiliar with such situations, so they could not help but look forward to it. They followed Su Hui up the stairs excitedly.Soon, only Si Ting remained on the first floor.Seeing that the others had left, it did not seem appropriate for him to remain there further. Thus, he took a step forward, intending to head upstairs.\u201cSi Ting, thank you for today,\u201d said Chu Liuyue seriously as she looked at him.Without Si Ting\u2019s maneuvers, these people would not have come today. Even though she was not worried about it, she had to thank Si Ting for his good intentions.Si Ting glanced at her. Sparkles seem to be rippling in Chu Liuyue\u2019s bright, black eyes. She seems to see through\u2026 everything.Si Ting felt his heartbeat speed up. He instinctively turned and hurried towards the second floor. \u201cIt was nothing. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dChu Liuyue confusedly blinked as she watched him leave, and then she chuckled. She did not expect the Si family\u2019s cold and sharp looking eldest young master to be shy.Si Ting paused when he heard the laughter behind him, and he felt his face heat up. In that instant, he felt like he had been seen right through. He felt a little exposed.Yan Ge suddenly asked, \u201cMs. Liuyue, are you happy with the arrangements this time?\u201dChu Liuyue touched her forehead helplessly. \u201cSecond Master Yan, your thank you gift is a little too expensive.\u201dEven if high-level fiends appeared in a hunting ground, one would not be able to cover the expenses of renting out the entire Phoenix Restaurant!\u201cIt\u2019s already too kind of you to rent out the place for three days. I didn\u2019t expect you to convince Manager Su to open up the rooms on the second floor\u2026 I can\u2019t repay you even if I sold another hunting ground to you. Are you sure Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2019s master will not have any objections to your actions?\u201dYan Ge felt his head throb when he heard this. Madam, the entire Zhen Bao Pavilion is yours, yet you\u2019re saying this? Master is moving rather slowly. There are many things that Madam doesn\u2019t know about yet\u2026He looked around before breaking into a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it! To be honest, all of the arrangements were Master\u2019s ideas.\u201dHis ideas? Chu Liuyue was taken aback. She was just prodding for information, but she did not expect Yan Ge would actually admit to it directly!But\u2026 she did not know Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2019s mysterious master!Why was he helping her?She did not believe that it was just because of the hunting ground!\u201cI don\u2019t know Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2019s master, so how\u2026\u201d\u201cHead of the Ou family, Ou Xiangtian; Head of the Sun family, Sun Xia; Zhenbei Duke, Jiang Yuan; Xiangnan Superintendent, Mo Qing\u2026\u201d At this time, more announcements came from the door!Everyone was stunned when they heard the names, and they looked towards the door.From the corner of his eye, Yan Ge saw Si Ting\u2014who was going up the stairs\u2014freeze. He laughed out loud and loudly said, \u201cMaster\u2019s orders were to make sure your banquet is lively and crowded!\u201dLiked it?

Brother Chu Ning, congratulations!\u201dThe laughter just broke out when several men entered Phoenix Restaurant.Chu Ning suppressed his surprise and went up to receive them. \u201cBrother Xiangtian, why are you all here?\u201dThese people were of high status. By right, they shouldn\u2019t have come\u2026\u201cBrother Chu Ning made a comeback after so many years, and you\u2019re now the imperial guards\u2019 Commander in Chief. Your beloved daughter got into Tian Lu Academy with stunning talent. Of course, we have to come and celebrate!\u201d said Ou Xiangtian as he patted Chu Ning\u2019s shoulder.The others nodded. They were clearly there for the same reasons.However, Chu Ning\u2019s doubt only deepened. He did know these people, but they were not close. After all, they were all outstanding members of their own families, so there was no way they would be particularly close.He had been down and under all these years, and people rarely paid attention to him.Based on these people\u2019s status, they didn\u2019t have to lower themselves, even if he and Yue\u2019er were different now.He could not help but take a look at Yan Ge. He clearly heard the words from earlier.Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2019s master said to make sure that Yue\u2019er\u2019s party is lively and crowded. Other than renting out Phoenix Restaurant, could it be that he has even invited guests on our behalf\u2026?\u201cBrother Chu Ning, this has to be your daughter, right?\u201d Ou Xiangtian and the others looked towards Chu Liuyue.Chu Liuyue greeted them one by one.\u201cThe apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree! Brother Chu Ning, I am envious of you for having such an outstanding daughter!\u201d Ou Xiangtian sighed. He meant what he said.Everyone in the Imperial City knew that Chu Liuyue had rare warrior and Xuan Master talent. The key point was that she was talented in both aspects!She became her year\u2019s top warrior and second-best Xuan Master on her first day of school! Who would not be jealous?!Chu Liuyue was rumored to be a good-for-nothing while Chu Ning was downtrodden because of his injury. Who would\u2019ve expected both of them to be where they are now?!\u201cWe\u2019re not too late, are we?\u201d asked Sun Xia.Chu Ning shook his head with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re just on time, please\u2026\u201dAfter hearing the commotion downstairs, the youngsters on the second floor were uneasy.\u201cWhy do I feel like I just heard my father\u2019s name?\u201d Ou Zhen asked confusedly. \u201cDid he beat me silly this morning?\u201d\u201cIt might be, but\u2026 I heard my father\u2019s name as well.\u201d Sun Xiaoxiang walked towards the door, looked down from the corridor, and became stunned. \u201cMy father really is here! Ou Zhen, your father is here too! You were not mistaken!\u201dOu Zhen\u2019s expression froze, and he hugged his head in agony. \u201cNo way?! He chased after me all the way here?! He refused to agree when I said I was coming in the morning, and I finally managed to sneak out! I\u2019m doomed! Doomed, I tell you! I\u2019m going to get it from him this time. No! I\u2019ve got to hide first!\u201dOu Zhen got to his feet, preparing to jump out of the window.\u201cWhy are you panicking!\u201d Wu Yingying grabbed Ou Zhen by his collar with disdain. \u201cLook at you! It\u2019s just that your father is here. If he really wanted to come for you, can you really get away?\u201dOu Zhen had a pained expression on his face because he really could not defeat his father!Si Ting\u2014who just arrived on the second floor\u2014plainly said, \u201cYour dad is not here to punish you.\u201dOu Zhen leaped over as if he had just seen his lifeline. \u201cSi Ting! You\u2019ve got to help me! If anything happens to me\u2026\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re here to offer their well-wishes too.\u201dSi Ting\u2019s words stunned the others into silence and disbelief.\u201cHo-how can that be? My father called me an idiot when I told him I wanted to come in the morning\u2026\u201d Ou Zhen mumbled.Sun Xiaoxiang cried out. \u201cThey\u2019re really coming upstairs! They have smiles on their faces too!\u201dThe students huddled together to look over.The people heading to the second floor seemed to be having a pleasant conversation with Chu Ning and Chu Liuyue!At this point, Ou Xiangtian looked up and saw Ou Zhen.The father-son duo\u2019s eyes met.Ou Zhen was ready to leave. \u201cComrades, I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha! Ah Zhen, you\u2019re here already!\u201dOu Zhen knew that he could not hide, so he could only smile stiffly. \u201cFather.\u201d\u201cThis child; do you not know to wait for me? Did you come without preparing any gifts?\u201dOu Zhen, who was waiting to be lectured: \u201c?\u201d\u201cHowever, Father has already brought the gift. Don\u2019t be so careless next time, okay?\u201dOu Zhen widened his eyes. Who was the one who said it was not appropriate to offend the Chu family? Who stopped me? Who called me an idiot?From the side, Sun Xia said, \u201cBrother Xiangtian, don\u2019t be mad. The children only wanted to have some fun. How could they have taken things like this into consideration? Look! My Xiaoxiang didn\u2019t bring anything either. As their elders, we have to bear the burden\u2026\u201dSun Xiaoxiang, who was implicated: \u201c?\u201d\u201cSirs, your room is by the side. Please\u2026\u201d Su Hui was smart, so he arranged for the adults to be placed in a room further away from the children.Si Yang gave Su Hui a silent thumbs-up.After the adults left, the youngsters still could not come to their senses.\u201cThis\u2026 They were here for Officer Chu, right?\u201dSi Ting stood behind them and quietly watched the young girl downstairs.Chu Liuyue was slender, calm, and collected, and had let her sleek hair down.He knew that Ou Xiangtian and the rest did not come for Chu Ning. No, they were here because of her\u2026An invisible hand is shielding her from the Imperial City\u2019s chaos. Who\u2026 is that person?!Liked it?

Many people belonging to rich and powerful families in the Imperial City had come.Phoenix Restaurant, which was calm earlier, quickly became lively.People came in succession to exchange pleasantries with Chu Ning, but they couldn\u2019t stop themselves from looking at Chu Liuyue. Some were curious, others were confused, and some even looked fearful.This girl\u2019s status must be extraordinary if it can make Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2019s Second Master Yan be so attentive to her.At the very least, with Zhen Bao Pavilion backing her up, few people will dare to provoke her in the open from now on.No wonder she dared to offend the Crown Prince and the Chu family without fearing the consequences. It isn\u2019t surprising when she has such backing.Chu Liuyue naturally noticed the different sorts of stares at her. She was calm on the surface, but in reality, she was becoming more and more confused.Who exactly is Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2019s Big Boss? Why is he helping me, and what exactly did he do to make the whole Imperial City so afraid of him? These people have inevitably offended the Crown Prince and the Chu family by coming to Phoenix Restaurant today. Nevertheless, they still came! When this is over, I\u2019m going to investigate thoroughly\u2026Chu Liuyue pushed these thoughts away and followed Chu Ning to greet the guests.Yan Ge stood beside them and greeted the guests as well. He looked more eager and sincere than them.Chu Ning might have been in the limelight back then, but he had been silent all these years. Even with his recent and sudden full recovery, he still felt a bit awkward.As Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2019s Second Boss, Yan Ge was best at getting along with all sorts of people. His presence made things easier for both Chu Liuyue and Chu Ning.Some people couldn\u2019t help themselves from whispering when they saw this.\u201cSecond Master Yan has always been a distinguished figure. Even the princes and princesses treat him with respect. Have you ever seen him treat anyone like this?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. This morning, when I heard that Zhen Bao Pavilion would be present, I didn\u2019t think much of it. I assumed that Chu Ning had spared no effort with the invitations. Who would have thought that this was obviously arranged by Second Master Yan at the last minute!\u201d\u201cHey, do you guys think he\u2019s being extra attentive toward Chu Liuyue? It seems like\u2026 he\u2019s being cautious? He takes Chu Liuyue\u2019s occasional words very seriously! Tsk\u2026 do you think he\u2019s taken a liking to her?\u201d\u201cShh! Be careful about what you say! You guys arrived late. Earlier, Second Master Yan himself said he was following his master\u2019s orders!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s strange. Doesn\u2019t he already have a wife\u2026\u201d\u201cWho knows what means Chu Liuyue used to deserve this? Anyway, the Crown Prince and the Chu family can\u2019t do anything to her for the time being with Zhen Bao Pavillion in the picture! I believe there\u2019s going to be more drama in the future!\u201d\u2026\u201cAre you speaking the truth? Ou Xiangtian and the others have gone?\u201dThe Lu family was taken aback after hearing Lu Zhitao\u2019s words.\u201cI\u2019ve spoken nothing but the truth! After Chu Liuyue offended the Crown Prince and the Chu family, I thought no one would attend the banquet even though she booked the whole Phoenix Restaurant. Nevertheless, it didn\u2019t take long before people started to arrive one after another. Quite a number of high profile people are there too! I came back immediately with that knowledge.\u201dLu Zhitao recalled all the prestigious names, and he shuddered inwardly. There might not even be so many attendees, even if it were a prince\u2019s or princess\u2019s banquet!The Lu family members fell silent.Lu Feiyan listened from the side with disdain. \u201cSo what? The Ou family may be powerful, but they can\u2019t even be compared with us! Apart from the royal family, we, the four great families, are the most powerful in the Imperial City. Si Ting and Si Yang may be there, but the other three families have yet to make their moves! Those people went for nothing!\u201dLu Ming, the head of the Lu family, was sullen. \u201cFool! On their own, none of them can be compared to the four great families. However, they can\u2019t be ignored when they join forces! If it were just for the sake of Chu Ning\u2019s promotion as the imperial guards\u2019 Commander in Chief, there\u2019s no reason for so many of them to go! There\u2019s definitely something fishy about it!\u201dLu Feiyan was reprimanded, and she became upset. However, she didn\u2019t retort when she saw Lu Ming\u2019s gloomy expression.\u201cI don\u2019t care if anyone goes or not; I\u2019m not going! Chu Liuyue ruined Minmin\u2019s face because of her own jealousy. If I go there, she might ruin my face too!\u201dLu Zhitao couldn\u2019t help from snorting as he listened. \u201cBig Sister, I have to disagree. Minmin may be pretty, but Chu Liuyue is much more beautiful than she is. Why should she be jealous of Minmin? Chances are that Minmin did something to offend her and got herself into trouble\u2026\u201d\u201cFour, what do you mean? Have you taken a liking to that b*tch?\u201d Lu Feiyan glared at him with bulging eyes and scolded.Lu Zhitao sneered inwardly.Lu Feiyan had always been domineering in the family because she had gotten into Tian Lu Academy. She acted as if she couldn\u2019t be offended. He had had an issue with her attitude for a long time.\u201cIsn\u2019t what I said the truth? Besides, Chu Liuyue has become the envy of everyone as a genius, and she has a father who is also the imperial guards\u2019 Commander in Chief. Many men will be asking for her hand in marriage! Minmin\u2019s reputation and her face are ruined. The Crown Prince won\u2019t bother himself about her well-being anymore. Sister, I advise you to keep your distance from her!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough! Shut up, all of you!\u201d Lu Ming snapped harshly. \u201cYou will all stay put at home today! No one is to step foot outside! I\u2019m going to the Crown Prince Mansion.\u201dThe Lu family had spent a lot of effort to maintain a cordial relationship with the Crown Prince. At a time like this, it was even more crucial for them to show their loyalty to him!No matter how powerful Zhen Bao Pavilion was, it couldn\u2019t be compared to the imperial court.

However, he couldn\u2019t take in anything because of his irritable mood. A beautiful girl\u2019s face also kept popping up in his mind, and he couldn\u2019t shake it away.He was still staring at the same folder after one hour without actually reading a single word. Finally, he put it away and rubbed the area between his brows. \u201cSong Yuan, how\u2019s the situation at the Chu family?\u201dSong Yuan\u2014who had cautiously been waiting outside\u2014came in when he was called. He bowed respectfully. \u201cYour Highness, Third Missy Chu is still recuperating in her bed. Her condition doesn\u2019t seem to be good\u2026\u201dRong Jin opened his eyes and looked at him.Bang!The prince slammed his palm against the tabletop and spoke in an icy tone. \u201cYou know very well what I was asking!\u201dSong Yuan shuddered and fell on his knees immediately. \u201cYour Highness, the Chu family sent news overnight. Hardly any restaurants in the entire Imperial City have accepted their reservation\u2026\u201dRong Jin closed his eyes, his mood somewhat improved. So what if Chu Liuyue is a double genius? Without support from her family clan, she is isolated on her own! She will know the consequences of going against me! When she is at the end of the rope, she will regret dissolving our marriage agreement on purpose!\u201cI own a restaurant in my name. Send word to her. Tell her I am willing to forgive her and offer my help this once if she comes and begs for my mercy in person.\u201dSong Yuan stood rooted to the spot. His expression became awkward. \u201cYour Highness, i-it\u2019s\u2026 Chu Liuyue has found a restaurant for her banquet\u2026\u201dRong Jin froze.\u201cZhen Bao Pavilion has booked the whole Phoenix Restaurant for Chu Liuyue\u2019s celebratory banquet\u2026\u201dClang!Rong Jin swept everything off his table. He had a murderous look on his face.Song Yuan dared not look up. He, too, had been shocked when he heard the news. However, this was not the most surprising thing!\u201cYour Highness, because of this, a rumor has started to spread in the Imperial City that Chu Liuyue has Zhen Bao Pavilion to back her up. Many people have gone to Phoenix Restaurant on account of Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2026\u201dA mighty pressure descended on Song Yuan! He didn\u2019t dare to resist. A blow struck his chest as he flew backward and slammed onto the ground!Poof!Song Yuan spat out a mouthful of blood but still managed to stand on his feet almost immediately. \u201cYour Highness, please calm down!\u201dRong Jin tightly clenched both his hands into fists. His entire being was being consumed by the anger inside him!Calm down? How am I supposed to calm down? I dissolved his marriage agreement with Chu Liuyue after much difficulty, even going as far as bearing Father\u2019s scolding. What about Chu Liuyue?She became a genius in the blink of an eye, and she is celebrating without a care! It\u2019s as though she wants everyone to know that she has been accepted into Tian Lu Academy! This is clearly a provocation from her to the Chu family and me!The more glamorous Chu Liuyue became, the more people would mock Rong Jin and the Chu family!\u201cAnd here I was thinking about how she could muster up so much courage to\u2026\u201d It turns out that she had already secured her position with Zhen Bao Pavilion!Rong Jin frowned as he paced in his study, and finally coldly said, \u201cSend someone to investigate immediately. I want to know everything about Zhen Bao Pavilion!\u201d\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Song Yuan looked up in surprise. He scrambled to discourage the prince. \u201cYour Highness, please think twice! Zhen Bao Pavilion has a mysterious background and is incredibly wealthy. It\u2019s not wise to mess with them! As you know, people have tried to investigate Zhen Bao Pavilion secretly, but they failed to achieve their goal miserably! You really don\u2019t need to get yourself into trouble because of this!\u201dHow could Rong Jin not know this?

They couldn\u2019t afford to offend the Crown Prince and the Chu family, but the consequences of offending Zhen Bao Pavilion were much worse!When the Crown Prince had suffered a loss at Zhen Bao Pavilion, he hadn\u2019t been able to retaliate.As such, people from all over Imperial City began to arrive in waves. By noon, the large Phoenix Restaurant was actually filled to the brim.\u201cManager, all the private rooms on the second floor have been filled up. The first floor is also full. We still have a dozen guests outside yet to be seated!\u201dThe pageboys at Phoenix Restaurant were so busy that they hadn\u2019t had time to rest their feet.Business in the restaurant was usually good, but the second floor was rarely open. Thus, things had never been this hectic.Chu Liuyue and the others had booked the venue. Although the first and second floors were packed to the brim, it still wasn\u2019t enough!Su Hui had a bit of a headache. He apologetically looked at Chu Ning and the others. \u201cLord Chu Ning, Ms. Liuyue, Second Master Yan, what do you think we should do?\u201dPhoenix Restaurant was an extremely high-end and elegant place. They never had this many people in the restaurant before.Chu Ning was at his wits\u2019 end as well. \u201cThe visitors are all guests. Besides, they\u2019re not of ordinary status. It will reflect badly on us if we do not treat them with the hospitality they deserve. Manager Su, is there really no place for them?\u201dSu Hui sighed helplessly and smiled. \u201cLord Chu Ning, there\u2019s really no room. We can\u2019t possibly seat them at the cloister in the center of the lake, can we?\u201dThe four of them fell into instant silence.Chu Liuyue looked at Yan Ge. \u201cSecond Master Yan, you\u2019ve invited too many people\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, Ms. Liuyue, you\u2019re mistaken. I didn\u2019t invite those people that came towards the end!\u201d Yan Ge quickly waved his hand. Those on his invite list were all respectable and dignified.The people that came later hadn\u2019t even popped up in his mind when he was drafting the invitation list. However, all of them came with an invitation!\u201cLord Chu Ning, you\u2019ve sent out too many invitations!\u201dChu Ning\u2019s hands balled into fists as he coughed. \u201cAt first, I thought not many of them would bother to come, so I sent a few more\u2026\u201dAt the time, he thought it would make a difference if only one of the people he invited did come here. However, he didn\u2019t expect all of them to be here!They had now run out of room in the restaurant!Chu Liuyue naturally knew what was on her father\u2019s mind. For a moment, she was caught between laughter and tears. She pondered for a moment and suddenly had an idea. \u201cOfficer Zhao, I wonder if it will be possible to trouble you for an errand?\u201dZhao Ming\u2014who had been standing to their side\u2014immediately replied, \u201cMs. Liuyue, I\u2019m at your command.\u201dChu Liuyue pulled out an invitation and handed it to him. \u201cOfficer Zhao, please deliver this invitation to the Chu family.\u201dAs soon as she said that, several people\u2019s expressions changed.\u201cYue\u2019er, what are you planning to do?\u201d Chu Ning frowned slightly. He didn\u2019t want to deal with the people from the Chu family on this joyous occasion!Zhao Ming took the invitation hesitantly. \u201cMs. Liuyue, are you sure you want to do this?\u201dChu Liuyue nodded.Yan Ge also couldn\u2019t figure out what she was thinking. He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cMs. Liuyue, we don\u2019t have enough space in Phoenix Restaurant. Why are you still sending out invitations, and\u2026 to the Chu family?\u201dChu Liuyue glanced and smiled at Chu Ning, who was wearing a disapproving look. \u201cFather, do you remember that pageboy sent by the Chu family this morning?\u201d\u201cOf course. Why are we talking about him?\u201dThis morning, before they came to Phoenix Restaurant with Su Hui, they had already sent the pageboy away.\u201cHave you forgotten? He said we could ask them for help if we don\u2019t have a venue to hold our banquet. The Chu family happens to own a few restaurants, right?\u201dChu Ning\u2019s eyes widened slowly. \u201cDo you mean\u2026\u201dChu Liuyue tapped on that invitation as her red lips curved. \u201cTheir restaurants are not up to the standard, so naturally we can\u2019t let our VIPs go there and suffer. However, we can have them bring over some tables and chairs and set them up on the street outside Phoenix Restaurant. I\u2019m sure we can put quite a number of tables outside.\u201d\u201cPhoenix Restaurant will still provide tea, wine, and food. At the same time, their staff can stay behind to help with the chores and save us from the manpower shortage. It\u2019s a win-win situation, isn\u2019t it?\u201dZhao Ming foolishly asked, \u201cI-is this okay?\u201d\u201cWhy not? Didn\u2019t they also say they\u2019ll give us a discount for old times\u2019 sake?\u201d Chu Liuyue smiled brightly. \u201cI, Chu Liuyue, can still afford to pay for this!\u201dAll those present were flabbergasted by what she said. It took them quite a long time to regain their senses.Yan Ge couldn\u2019t help himself from giving her a thumbs up. \u201cMs. Liuyue, you\u2019re simply amazing!\u201dThis is no longer a slap; she is literally ripping the Chu family\u2019s face off, throwing it on the ground, and stomping on it! When this invitation arrives at the Chu family, it will antagonize them so much that they will vomit blood! She is indeed worthy of Master\u2019s love. This strategy is fantastic!Chu Liuyue urged, \u201cOfficer Zhao, please.\u201d\u201cOh! Sure! I\u2019ll do it right away!\u201d Zhao Ming broke into a wide smile. He took the invitation and headed to the Chu family without further ado.Su Hui regained his senses and cupped his hands in admiration. \u201cMs. Liuyue, that\u2019s really clever.\u201d\u201cManager Su, I\u2019m flattered. However, I hope you don\u2019t mind the trouble we\u2019ve caused.\u201d\u201cHow could I?\u201d Su Hui shook his head. Then, he sighed inwardly. The Chu family must have eight generations of bad luck to offend this lady! They thought they could teach her a lesson by utilizing their family\u2019s resources, but who would have expected them to meet their match! The Chu family is going to be a laughingstock in the Imperial City again!Chu Liuyue looked towards the door. She rested a hand on her cheek, then tapped her chin as she thoughtfully asked, \u201cAs I recall, the Crown Prince also seems to own a restaurant under his name?\u201dLiked it?

He didn\u2019t dare stay any longer.The others in the hall didn\u2019t look good as well.\u201cWho sent that person this morning?\u201d First Elder asked angrily.No one spoke.Piak!First Elder slapped the table so hard that the corners splintered immediately!\u201cAnswer me!\u201dChu Yan cringed. Finally, he stepped forward and whispered, \u201cI-I was going to humiliate them. I-I\u2026 didn\u2019t expect\u2026\u201d\u201cHumiliate them? Open your eyes wide and take a look! Who is humiliating who? If this gets out, it\u2019ll embarrass our family. This is all your fault!\u201dThe unfairness suffocated Chu Yan. At the time, First Elder had been aware of his actions and had agreed to send the pageboy, too. Now that things had taken a turn for the worse, he flipped out and made it look like it was all Chu Yan\u2019s fault.\u201c\u2026 Nobody knows she\u2019s capable of doing this\u2026\u201dThe gloom on First Elder\u2019s face was horrifying.This wasn\u2019t the most important thing. What troubled them the most was that half the city\u2019s most respectable people had already gone to Phoenix Restaurant! No matter what, it was a done deal! This event would certainly solidify Chu Ning\u2019s and Chu Liuyue\u2019s statuses in Imperial City!\u201cFirst Elder, I hear that the Lu family head has gone to Crown Prince Mansion. What do you think\u2026 What should we do now?\u201d someone asked.First Elder breathed in deeply. The Crown Prince is still fuming about what happened between Chu Liuyue and Chu Xianmin. He won\u2019t show the Chu family any kindness! We thought we could rely on Chu Xianmin when she climbed the social ladder with the prince\u2019s connections, but who would have expected things to turn out this way? However, this isn\u2019t the time to lose the support from Crown Prince Mansion!\u201cI\u2019ll have to go there myself!\u201d\u2026Chu Liuyue had expected the Chu family\u2019s rejection. Instead of panicking, Chu Liuyue asked Su Hui to send his men to the other restaurants to seek help. At the same time, she also sent someone to send an invitation to Crown Prince Mansion.Chu Liuyue didn\u2019t care whether Rong Jin came or not. However, she was happy to give some problems to others.Unlike the previous repeated refusals, quite a few restaurants immediately agreed this time. Their attitudes were completely different from this morning.Table after table was set up outside Phoenix Restaurant, occupying almost half the street. People mingled around, and the aroma of the wine was overwhelming. It was really lively!The focus of everyone\u2019s discussions naturally didn\u2019t stray away from Chu Ning and Chu Liuyue.Who would have thought that the father-daughter duo, who had been constantly bullied, would be in the limelight? This truly reflected the ever-changing world with an unpredictable future.As Chu Ning listened to his peers\u2019 countless congratulatory words, he couldn\u2019t help but feel sad. He knew very well that all this happened because of Yue\u2019er.\u201cBrother Chu Ning, if I remember correctly, Liuyue is of marriageable age. Now that she\u2019s single, and you\u2019ve just been promoted, I wonder if you\u2019ve been considering the sons from any families?\u201d\u201cYes! Your daughter is simply outstanding. Many people in the Imperial City will be keeping an eye on her! Haha!\u201d\u201cBrother Chu Ning, what do you think of my son?\u201d\u201cAnd my nephew! He\u2019s also a student at Tian Lu Academy! They must have something to talk about together!\u201dChu Ning was beginning to get anxious. After what happened with the Crown Prince, he had become more cautious. For the time being, he didn\u2019t see the rush in getting Yue\u2019er engaged. \u201cGentlemen, Yue\u2019er is still young. Now\u2014\u201d\u201cPrince Li has arrived!\u201d Chu Ning was interrupted by this announcement. It also got everyone\u2019s attention!Countless pairs of eyes turned towards the door!Prince Li!This person hadn\u2019t received many guests since his return to the Imperial City.

He was tall, lean, had broad shoulders, and a narrow waist. When he moved, a dark light seemed to be flowing on the hem of his clothes.The sun was high, yet there seemed to be a layer of cold air lingering on his body, surrounding him. He looked like an unattainable snowy mountain peak.A pair of saber-like eyebrows slanted toward his temple. His nose was straight, and his eyes sparkled like the stars in the Milky Way on a beautiful night. One could easily lose themself just by looking into his eyes.His scarlet lips\u2019 curves were perfect. It added warmth to the somewhat thin lips with the bead in the middle.The man\u2019s eyes resembled the world\u2019s most tranquil and brilliant starry night, while his lips had the colors of intimacy and seduction. He was warm as jade, yet cold and noble. The aloofness between his eyebrows made one yearn for him subconsciously.Everyone fell silent.Few had seen this man since his return to the city; most of the people here were even seeing him for the first time.Nobody expected Prince Li, the one rumored to be weak and mysterious, would be born with such features!Some of the women present blushed silently.Rong Xiu was oblivious to those gazes. He made a beeline towards the restaurant\u2019s most inner part.Chu Ning was the first to come to his senses. He was pleasantly surprised and stepped forward. \u201cYour Highness, what brings you here today?\u201d In Chu Ning\u2019s opinion, Prince Li was a great benefactor to them because he had saved his daughter from difficult situations time and time again.When everyone had despised them, His Highness was the only one to lend them a helping hand. Naturally, he felt differently about Prince Li. He heard that Prince Li had been sick all this time and refused all visitors who had wanted to pay their respects.He had sent the invitation out of courtesy without much expectation, but the prince actually came in person!Chu Ning was simply delighted and surprised.Rong Xiu nodded gently and smiled. \u201cLord Chu Ning\u2019s promotion is a joyous occasion. My health has improved lately, so I thought I should come, take advantage of the celebration, and join in the fun. However, I had been delayed because of some matters. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201dChu Ning hurriedly said, \u201cOf course, not! Yue\u2019er and I are so happy that Your Highness is here!\u201dRong Xiu\u2019s brows rose slightly. He finally laid his eyes on Chu Liuyue at the side, quickly sweeping past her. \u201cOh? Does Ms. Liuyue think the same?\u201d His tone of voice sounded polite. However, who would\u2019ve thought that this man had stayed in her room the previous night and refused to leave?Chu Liuyue was secretly cursing him. Since you want to put on a show, I\u2019ll go along with it!She bowed. \u201cMy father\u2019s thoughts reflect my exact feelings. We are humbled and honored by your presence.\u201dRong Xiu watched her half-hearted appearance. The smile at the corners of his lips deepened.Everyone was astonished by what they saw.His Highness, Prince Li, seems to be friends with Chu Ning and his daughter. When did they get to know each other? Otherwise, why would he choose to be here today when he has rejected all the other invitations?His Highness, the Seventh Prince, had a distinguished status and was a member of the royal family. He might have spent most of his time away from the Imperial City, but he was bestowed the title of \u2018Prince Li\u2019 by His Majesty as soon as he returned. It was proof of how much the emperor liked him.When had Chu Ning forged a connection with him?\u201cYour Highness, please come inside.\u201d\u2026Although many people came today, nobody had a higher status than Prince Li. Naturally, they had a place for him upon his arrival.In other words, he was seated at the same table as Chu Ning and Chu Liuyue.Yan Ge was also seated at the same table.\u201cYour Highness, please sit down.\u201d\u201cLord Chu Ning, please don\u2019t stand on ceremony. I will follow your lead.\u201dChu Ning respected Rong Xiu, but His Highness didn\u2019t treat him with arrogance. The latter\u2019s behavior only made Chu Ning appreciate him more.Chu Liuyue saw the way Rong Xiu and Chu Ning were talking to each other, and her mouth couldn\u2019t help but twitch.Her own father had been completely deceived by Rong Xiu\u2019s appearance!\u201cChu Liuyue, why don\u2019t you pour some tea for His Highness? His Highness has helped us several times, but we have yet to thank him properly,\u201d said Chu Ning.A sudden thought came to Chu Liuyue. She reached out and picked up a jug of wine, avoiding the teapot.The clear wine drew a line in the air and flowed into a cup. Its crisp, bamboo fragrance filled the air.\u201cYour Highness, please try this premium Green Bamboo Leaf Wine. You\u2019ll definitely like it.\u201dA stunned Chu Ning stopped her with disapproval. \u201cYue\u2019er, His Highness has just recovered. How can he drink wine?\u201dChu Liuyue blinked and looked at Rong Xiu. \u201cYour Highness, I noticed that you are wearing thin clothing. I was worried that you\u2019d catch a cold, so I poured you some wine to warm you up. You don\u2019t like it?\u201dRong Xiu stared into her sparkling eyes. He knew she was doing this on purpose. \u201cMy body really can\u2019t take too much wine\u2026\u201dChu Liuyue raised an eyebrow, and she was about to take the jug of wine away.Rong Xiu suddenly lifted his hand and gently pressed on her wrist. His hand was cold, yet it seemed like a fire had started burning. \u201cNevertheless, Ms. Liuyue has poured the wine yourself. How can I refuse?\u201dHe rested his hand for a moment, then withdrew it without fuss as if he was only stopping her from removing the wine jug.Chu Ning didn\u2019t see anything improper. He smiled helplessly. \u201cI have a wilful daughter. Please forgive her, Your Highness.\u201dRong Xiu\u2019s thin lips curled. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201d I\u2019m already used to it.Chu Liuyue snorted inwardly, shifted her attention, and realized Yan Ge was still standing at the side. \u201cSecond Master Yan, why aren\u2019t you sitting?\u201dYan Ge smiled awkwardly. \u201cNo, no. I-I\u2019m\u2026 having a slight discomfort in my back. I\u2019ll just stand!\u201d He wouldn\u2019t dare to sit at the same table with his master, even if he had the gall to do so!Liked it?

It was fine if others called him this. However, for this person to call him this\u2026 It was killing him!\u201c\u2026 This, it\u2019s not appropriate\u2026\u201d Yan Ge forced a smile. \u201cYour Highness is of noble status.

Something is strange about Yan Ge\u2019s behavior today\u2026 Even if Rong Xiu is royalty, given Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2019s standing in Imperial City, he doesn\u2019t have to act like this.The fuzzy thoughts flashed across her mind. However, just as she was about to look deeper into it, a hand suddenly reached over and took her cup of alcohol from her.\u201cYoung ladies should just drink tea.\u201d As Rong Xiu spoke, he switched her cup and poured her a cup of tea.His actions were so natural that none of the people around them thought it was strange. Even Chu Ning looked at him with increased admiration.Chu Liuyue raised her eyebrows as she looked at the hot tea before her eyes. Is this\u2026 tit for tat?\u2026\u201cHey, why do you all think Prince Li is here today? All the invites previously sent to Prince Li Mansion were rejected. What does Chu Ning have to be able to get him here?\u201d\u201cWho knows? Chu Ning\u2019s position as the imperial guards\u2019 Commander in Chief is not low, but it shouldn\u2019t be good enough for Prince Li to attend, right?\u201d\u201cHowever, I heard that Prince Li helped Chu Liuyue out when the Fourth Princess made things difficult for her at the Crown Prince\u2019s birthday banquet\u2026 It can\u2019t be that he has his eyes set on her, right?\u201d\u201cHow can that be? He just returned to Imperial City!\u201d\u201cHow else can we explain why he stood up for Chu Liuyue? Surely he must know that coming here is the same as offending the Crown Prince and the Chu family, right?\u201d\u201cHa, I think you\u2019re onto something. I think Prince Li is taking the chance to taunt the Crown Prince. He was crowned a lord the moment he returned. How can the Crown Prince not have anything to say?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s so sickly, what is there to fight for\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know? I heard that Prince Li\u2019s mother was\u2026 by the empress\u2026\u201d At this point, the person grew wary and stopped talking.It was quiet all around as the people stared at one another before deciding to change topics.\u201cNo matter what, Chu Ning and Chu Liuyue will have a stable position in the Imperial City after today\u2026 The Chu family has lost their face today. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll take it lying down!\u201d\u201cHmph, the Chu family has not produced a prodigy like this in years. Without Chu Ning and Chu Liuyue, their days are going to be tough\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Chu family has occupied a position in the top four families for too long\u2026\u201d\u2026Chu Liuyue had just taken a sip of her tea when she heard a commotion outside. She walked towards the window and looked downstairs.Their room had the best view on the second floor. The open windows on one side revealed the restaurant\u2019s lake, while the windows on the other side revealed the street.Chu Liuyue saw a group of people approaching on horses.A number of stalls were knocked over on the streets, causing much chaos. But the owners of the disrupted businesses dared not speak and just hurriedly packed up their items.Chu Liuyue squinted her eyes before she saw that the group of people was dressed in armor. It was the imperial guards.However\u2026 what has happened for them to be this anxious?At this time, one of the guards broke away from the group and headed towards Phoenix Restaurant. \u201cCan I ask if Commander in Chief Chu Ning is here?\u201dSu Hui was downstairs, and he knew that something was off, but he still promptly replied. \u201cLord Chu Ning is here indeed.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the leader of the seventh bridge, Ji Qingfeng. I request an audience with Commander in Chief!\u201d The person looked like he was in his late twenties, and anxiety was plastered all over his face.\u201cPlease hold on, Officer Ji, I\u2019ll report right away\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease invite Officer Ji up directly,\u201d said Chu Liuyue.Ji Qingfeng looked up and saw a slender silhouette by the window on the second floor. He couldn\u2019t be bothered with anything else and rushed upstairs.Even though Chu Ning had not met this person, he had a working knowledge of the imperial guards\u2019 situation, so he had heard of Ji Qingfeng.\u201cGreetings, Commander in Chief!\u201dJi Qingfeng had a tense expression. He was about to bow, but Chu Ning stopped him.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Chu Ning asked with tightly knitted brows.\u201cCommander, the Fourth Princess went to the hunting ground this morning.

It\u2019s just that the river current beneath the cliff is fast flowing, and it\u2019s been an hour since she disappeared. She has not been found yet! His Majesty is very upset.

He had to be there during times like this. He had just taken a step when he suddenly remembered Chu Liuyue. He turned to look at his daughter guiltily. \u201cYue\u2019er\u2026\u201d\u201cFourth Princess\u2019s matters are more important. You should hurry and leave, Father.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Chu Ning was a little hesitant.\u201cI\u2019ll look after things here. Lord Chu Ning need not worry.

I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to hurry back as well.\u201dChu Liuyue understood, and she nodded. \u201cThis matter is important. Second Master Yan should hurry back as soon as you can.\u201dNo matter what, the incident happened on their grounds. Thus, they were partly responsible for it.Yan Ge shot a quick glance at Rong Xiu, and he cupped his fists. \u201cI\u2019ll take my leave first. I hope that Ms. Liuyue will understand.\u201d\u201cSecond Master Yan is a busy man. Liuyue is grateful that you could join us today.\u201d Chu Liuyue shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll send you off\u2026\u201d\u201cNo need! There are a lot of guests today, and Lord Chu Ning has just left. You have a lot of things to do, so I won\u2019t trouble you! I\u2019ll be taking my leave!\u201d With that, Yan Ge quickly left without looking back.Yan Qing, who was standing at the door, looked at Yan Ge with sympathy as he fled. What does Fourth Princess\u2019s disappearance count as?This fellow was probably traumatized from taking a seat earlier\u2026 His heart probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to take it if he stayed any longer.The rather lively room only had Rong Xiu and Chu Liuyue left.Rong Xiu rubbed his cup, with worry between his brows.\u201cI heard that the hunting ground\u2019s terrain is rather dangerous. This time\u2026 Fourth Princess is in danger.\u201d Chu Liuyue looked at him. \u201cYour Highness, Fourth Princess is in an accident. Are you not going to take a look?\u201dRong Xiu drank the cup of alcohol slowly, and the fragrance of alcohol spread across the room. \u201cFather has already sent the imperial guards to search for her. My presence would only create problems, so I might as well wait here,\u201d he said plainly.Chu Liuyue raised her brows. \u201cHere?\u201dRong Xiu tapped on the sides of the cup as he looked at Chu Liuyue. \u201cI seem to have left something at your place. I\u2019ll pick it up when all this is over.\u201dChu Liuyue instinctively wanted to reject it. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for so much trouble. Why don\u2019t I go back and get it for you now?\u201dRong Xiu paused and looked at her with a wry smile. \u201cYou want everyone here to know that my clothes are at your place?\u201dChu Liuyue: \u201c\u2026 But it\u2019s even more inappropriate for Your Highness to go to my place, right?\u201dRong Xiu looked into her eyes, seemingly smiling, and nonchalantly said, \u201cNo one will see if I go at night.\u201dChu Liuyue was speechless. Shameless!\u2026After both Chu Ning and the imperial guards were deployed, many people felt that something was wrong and sent people to investigate.Many knew that the Fourth Princess was at the hunting ground today. Besides, given the gravity of the situation, it couldn\u2019t be kept under wraps.The news spread quickly.Everyone was stunned.Hunting grounds were rather dangerous, but the Fourth Princess has bodyguards. How did something so serious happen?Besides, if they were right, the hunting ground the Fourth Princess went to seemed to be the one that Zhen Bao Pavilion bought from Chu Liuyue a while back?If anything happened to the Fourth Princess, a lot of people were going to be implicated!A lot of people connected the dots, and some even got up and left.Chu Liuyue knew what they were thinking. They were just fence-sitters. She was not bothered and sent them off.When she passed by the room that Si Yang and the others were in, she saw that they were all standing at the door.\u201cYou all are leaving too?\u201d Chu Liuyue asked.\u201cForget about that. How can you still have the time to think about this now?\u201d Si Yang hurried forward. \u201cDo you know that the hunting ground where the accident occurred is\u2026\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cWhy are you still so calm then? Aren\u2019t you afraid that His Majesty will blame you for this?\u201dSi Yang was not the only one who was worried. The others were rather worried as well, believing that the matter was rather troublesome.\u201cThat hunting ground does not have much to do with me. Besides, Fourth Princess is the one who insisted on going there to hunt for high-level fiends. I don\u2019t think anyone else is to blame for it, right?\u201dSi Yang and the others paused.That seems to make sense, but something seems off\u2026\u201cBut that\u2019s the Fourth Princess\u2026\u201dChu Liuyue smiled. Rong Jin can\u2019t even do anything after he was taken advantage of, not to mention Rong Zhen, who is asking for it.\u201cFourth Princess is blessed and protected by His Majesty\u2019s blessings. She\u2019ll be fine, so let\u2019s just wait patiently.Si Yang and the others looked at each other and nodded.\u2026The news came in the evening.Fourth Princess Rong Zhen fell off the cliff and broke both her legs. Since she was attacked by a mysterious high-level fiend and did not receive treatment on time, her pearl of essence was destroyed, and she was handicapped.Liked it?

Royal Palace, Jiaolan Palace.The moon was high in the sky. It was an especially quiet night.The entire Jiaolan Palace was enveloped in a somber atmosphere. Even the servants held their breath, afraid that they would get in trouble. Their eyes, which looked towards the inner palace, were filled with panic and fear.Fourth Princess had regained consciousness an hour ago. In this short time, she had given orders for the execution of five people!If they were not careful, they might be next!Pak!There was a sharp sound like something was thrown to the ground.Everyone was petrified.Nobody would be able to handle becoming handicapped overnight, not to mention Fourth Princess, who had been the apple of everyone\u2019s eyes!\u201cI don\u2019t believe it! I don\u2019t believe it!\u201d Rong Zhen\u2019s voice was hoarse from shouting the past hour, but her voice grew increasingly shrill. \u201cYou all must be lying! I am the talented Fourth Princess! How can I be handicapped?!\u201dInside the palace, Rong Zhen was seated on the bed. Her hair was a mess, and her eyes were vicious and crazed.A few people knelt before her bed.The person in the front was struck on the head by an object. Blood trickled down, looking rather messy. Even if they were afraid, they had no choice but to plead with her.\u201cFourth Princess, your pearl of essence was broken, and your Yuan meridian has been damaged. Cultivating is going to be tough for you from now on\u2026\u201d\u201cYou imbeciles! So what if my pearl of essence is broken? I can just form another one!\u201d Rong Zhen cut him off suddenly, her voice sharp.The few of them looked down silently.Her pearl of essence was broken, and her body had taken a lot of damage. It was impossible for her to form another one.\u201cHeavenly doctor! Call for a heavenly doctor! If you can\u2019t do it, the heavenly doctor can!\u201d Rong Zhen refused to give up, refusing to accept the result.As she looked at the people who remained silent, Rong Zhen felt more and more desperate. She actually knew what kind of fate was awaiting her. But\u2026 how could she accept it?!\u201cZhen Zhen, your body is still weak. Why aren\u2019t you resting?\u201d A person hurried in from outside the door. It was the Empress.While looking up at the person, Rong Zhen\u2019s tears began to fall. \u201cMother! You have to help me!\u201dThe Empress hurried over. Her heart ached to see her beloved daughter in this state, and she brought Rong Zhen into her embrace. \u201cZhen Zhen, don\u2019t worry. Mother has called for them. No matter what, I\u2019ll try my best to help you. However, you were too careless this time\u2026\u201dRong Zhen wanted to get up, but the sharp pain from her legs reminded her that they were broken. Her anguish, hatred, and anger only grew stronger.She then burst out into a tantrum. \u201cMother! It\u2019s all that beast\u2019s fault! If it weren\u2019t for it, I wouldn\u2019t be in this state! Also, that hunting ground! Mother, didn\u2019t you go and see Father? Has he agreed to close down the hunting ground? Chu Liuyue is the one who sold it to Zhen Bao Pavilion. They are definitely involved in this! I want them to pay for this with their lives!\u201dThe Empress\u2019 expression stiffened. She hesitated for a while before she spoke with much difficulty. \u201cZhen Zhen, this happened because you insisted on going to the hunting ground. I\u2019m afraid\u2026 it\u2019ll be hard\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy?!\u201d Rong Zhen pushed her mother aside but instantly understood something after seeing her mother\u2019s hesitance. \u201cT-this is Father\u2019s wish?\u201d\u201cYou are dismissed.\u201d The Empress dismissed all the people in the room before she sighed. She shook her head indignantly. \u201cYou know your father\u2019s temperament\u2026\u201d\u201cMother!\u201d Rong Zhen looked at her in disbelief. \u201cFather has always doted on me.

As the Fourth Princess of Country Yao Chen, do I not have the right to pursue the matter now that I\u2019m in this state?!\u201cMother, just what is Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2019s background to have Father protecting them like this? Does he not care about the lives of his children?\u201d Rong Zhen could not understand! \u201cIt was the same with Crown Prince Brother! Zhen Bao Pavilion took over the hunting ground that he had carefully managed, but nothing came out of it!\u201d\u201cYou should know that even the Crown Prince doesn\u2019t stand a chance against Zhen Bao Pavilion!\u201d The Empress cut her off. One was her son, the other her daughter. How could she not have hatred? Therefore, she went to plead with His Majesty despite knowing that Zhen Bao Pavilion was different to him.However, the results were as expected\u2014he did not intend on punishing Zhen Bao Pavilion!\u201cBesides, they turned you down several times when you wanted to go to that hunting ground. They only made an exception for you because you insisted. Many people know about this! Who can you blame for your accident now? Everyone at the hunting ground witnessed it. You only fell off the cliff because you insisted on chasing after that beast! What reason do you have to pursue the matter?\u201dThe Empress felt anguished. Rong Zhen was in the wrong, so she could only suffer the consequences!Rong Zhen could not refute her mother\u2019s words. However, she had always been arrogant and prideful, so how could she admit that it was her fault? \u201cEven so, are they free of all responsibility? What will happen to me in the future?\u201dAm I really going to become handicapped?! How can I take this?!The Empress suppressed her tempestuous emotions. \u201cZhen Zhen, don\u2019t worry! Mother will not abandon you. Even if they don\u2019t have any means, we\u2019ll think of something else! The envoys from Tianling Dynasty will be here soon. Maybe they\u2019ll have an idea\u2026\u201dRong Zhen\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cReally?\u201dThe Empress forced a smile. \u201cYou know what kind of place the Tianling Dynasty is. For all we know\u2026 they might have a way. I will help you then!\u201d\u2026Night.Chu Ning only returned home long after Chu Liuyue did. Chu Ning told her about the matter briefly and shook his head with a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity. Fourth Princess was rather talented. That\u2019s why His Majesty spoiled her. But from now\u2026\u201dHe thought of how Rong Zhen had made things difficult for Yue\u2019er and mocked her for being a good-for-nothing at the Crown Prince\u2019s birthday banquet. Little did they expect the tables to turn. Yue\u2019er was now the prodigy, and Rong Zhen was the handicapped one.The father-daughter duo had been bullied back then, and they did not expect things to turn out the way they did today.Chu Liuyue smiled. \u201cLife is unpredictable. You have to repay what you owe.\u201dNo matter how one looked at it, Rong Zhen was the one responsible for the matter. Nobody else could be blamed for this. However, Chu Liuyue felt that something was a little strange.It seemed like an invisible hand controlled everything, but she did not know who it belonged to.\u201cOh, right. Father, did you all find the fiend that injured the Fourth Princess?\u201d\u201cNo, it was a high-level fiend. The people protecting the princess were not its match. They didn\u2019t even know what it was. His Majesty has ordered for a thorough investigation, but I think it\u2019ll be tough. I\u2019ll be busier during this time, so you should be more careful.\u201dChu Ning was a little hesitant as he spoke. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in the limelight for the last couple of days, so they won\u2019t do anything. But after a while, I\u2019m afraid\u2026 I\u2019ll send someone to protect you in the dark.\u201dChu Ning was naturally referring to the people from Crown Prince Mansion and the Chu family. He did not believe that they would give up easily!Chu Liuyue smiled. \u201cFather, don\u2019t worry. When the banquet ends, school will start again. You\u2019ve just been promoted, and you have to deal with this. I know you\u2019ll be busy, so I intend to stay at school first. What do you think?\u201dChu Ning heaved a sigh of relief. He had almost forgotten about this. Compared to outside, Tian Lu Academy was much safer. \u201cYou can make the decision. Of course, I\u2019ll agree to it.\u201d\u2026\u201cYou want to stay in school?\u201dChu Liuyue felt a cool scent when she returned to her room. She turned to look, and it was indeed Rong Xiu.His deep gaze landed on her body, gentle but powerful.Chu Liuyue was not surprised by his arrival. He was good at masking himself, so there was nothing she could do about it. She could always leave if he were here.Chu Liuyue nodded. She smiled as she removed his cloak from the cupboard and handed it to him. \u201cTherefore, it\u2019s better for Your Highness not to come. It\u2019s more important for you to recuperate in your mansion.\u201dRong Xiu glanced at the cloak and took it from her with raised brows. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Yue\u2019er to be so concerned about my body.\u201dChu Liuyue shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019ve offended the Crown Prince. I\u2019m afraid your life is going to be difficult.\u201dThe Crown Prince clearly saw Rong Xiu as a thorn in his side. His attitude was clear from the banquet.Now that Rong Xiu was on her side, the Crown Prince was bound to be even angrier.Rong Xiu bent down when he heard this and inched closer. The distance between the two was closed; they were within inches of each other.Chu Liuyue was about to back away, but she saw two tiny reflections of herself in Rong Xiu\u2019s deep eyes.His voice was deep, like strings plucked by the wind. \u201cI can\u2019t thank him enough for giving you up.\u201dLiked it?

His behavior at the banquet was deliberate, but\u2026 why?\u201cYour Highness, you\u2026\u201d Chu Liuyue wanted the situation clarified, but Rong Xiu had straightened himself.\u201cYou\u2019ve had a busy day. I won\u2019t bother you.\u201d Rong Xiu put his cloak over himself and left. His tall, dark silhouette disappeared in the night.Chu Liuyue only sighed with relief after she stared in the direction Rong Xiu disappeared in for a while. She then curled her fingers.Just now\u2026 Rong Xiu was so close to her, and her heart had begun to speed up.In theory, she would never let someone \u2018disrespect\u2019 her like this, but\u2026 she did not seem to dislike Rong Xiu\u2019s closeness. For some reason, she seemed to believe that Rong Xiu would not harm her.She did not know where her sense of trust came from.After the heartbreaking betrayal in her past life, she thought that she would never get close to anyone. However, both Chu Ning and Rong Xiu were able to make her lower her guard gradually.Chu Liuyue thought about it for a while, but she could not think of anything, so she stopped obsessing over it.As usual, she sat on her bed and continued to cultivate, taking in the Heaven and Earth Force. She only lay down to rest after one Heavenly Cycle.\u2026The celebrations at Phoenix Restaurant went on for two more days, but Rong Xiu did not appear again. This disappointed many who had wanted to take the chance to get close to Prince Li.However, he was royalty, and it was rare for him to come at all.Many tried to get information out of Chu Liuyue, but she dismissed them. They could only assume that Chu Ning and Prince Li had relations, but they did not get anything out of her.From the way she spoke, Chu Liuyue did not seem like she was familiar with Prince Li.That was expected. How could someone of Prince Li\u2019s status have dealings with Chu Liuyue? Even if she was in Tian Lu Academy and was a prodigious warrior and Xuan Master, there was a huge gap between herself and Prince Li since she didn\u2019t have the big families\u2019 support.On the other hand, Chu Ning was the Imperial guards\u2019 Commander in Chief\u2014the Emperor\u2019s close aide. Thus, he was of higher value. However, he was busy dealing with the Fourth Princess\u2019s accident and did not appear at the restaurant. This disappointed many.The few events coupled together reduced the people\u2019s attention on Chu Liuyue.Thankfully, Yan Ge was there the whole time, which helped Chu Liuyue a lot. It was also his presence that suppressed any ideas anyone would have.No matter what, Chu Liuyue had the backing of Zhen Bao Pavilion and was not to be trifled with.\u2026Time passed quickly. In the blink of an eye, school had reopened.This was Chu Liuyue\u2019s first day of classes since she entered the academy.Quite a number of people were at the academy\u2019s gates, which made it seem rather lively.Chu Liuyue\u2019s descent from the carriage attracted many people\u2019s attention.The lively entrance quietened.Countless eyes looked over with mixed feelings.\u201cLittle Liuyue, you\u2019re finally here!\u201d Following the excited voice, someone hurried towards Chu Liuyue. It was Bai Chen.Chu Liuyue greeted him. \u201cTeacher Bai Chen.\u201dHe looked at her happily. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you for a while. Why are you here only now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m staying in school and had a lot of things to pack, so I arrived a little later,\u201d explained Chu Liuyue.Bai Chen chuckled. \u201cYour living quarters have been prepared. Just follow me!\u201dChu Liuyue nodded. \u201cThank you for the trouble, Teacher Bai Chen.\u201d\u201cWhat trouble! You\u2019re not a popular character in the academy. Many wanted this chance, but they couldn\u2019t beat me! Hehe!\u201dEveryone had witnessed Chu Liuyue\u2019s talent. Though she had chosen to cultivate as a Xuan Master, she had not chosen a teacher yet.All the Xuan Master teachers were excited. Everyone wanted a talented disciple!Today was her first day in school. Of course, they could not miss the chance to get close to her!Bai Chen did not have much hope about getting chosen, but he liked Chu Liuyue from the bottom of his heart, so he was happy to be here.\u201cEverything on this carriage is your belongings, right?\u201d\u201cYes. They\u2019re just daily necessities.\u201d\u201cThen, I\u2019ll get someone to help you\u2026\u201dBefore Bai Chen could finish, a mocking voice cut him off. \u201cWhat kind of lousy carriage is this? Someone also has the guts to park it in front of the school?\u201dThe voice was a little familiar to Chu Liuyue. Chu Liuyue looked around and saw a familiar face.Lu Feiyan. She stood from afar, covering her nose as she looked at Chu Liuyue\u2019s carriage with disdain. Her arrogance was written all over her face. \u201cIs this carriage made of rotten wood? Why does it smell like mold?\u201dHer gaze swept across Chu Liuyue\u2019s body as she smiled coldly. She raised her voice deliberately and spoke to the girls around her. \u201cLook, that horse\u2019s fur is patchy and of various colors. It\u2019s clearly a lousy breed. Will ladies of respectable families use something like this?They nodded in agreement.\u201cYan\u2019er, she\u2019s no longer from a good family. Of course, she can\u2019t compare with us.\u201d\u201cYeah! So what if she\u2019s a prodigy? She\u2019s still just as poor. What a joke!\u201dBai Chen\u2019s expression changed, and he was about to scold them, but Chu Liuyue stopped him.\u201cTeacher Bai Chen, I know that carriages cannot enter the academy, but I have quite the number of items. Could you get someone to help me?\u201dBai Chen paused and then said, \u201cOf course!\u2019Chu Liuyue smiled as she looked at Lu Feiyan and company. \u201cThen, you all will do.\u201dLiked it?

Why are you throwing a tantrum?\u201d Bai Chen spoke directly and harshly. He had seen such scenes often and was not affected by it at all. \u201cIf you want to throw a tantrum, go back to the Lu family.\u201dAfter getting scolded, Lu Feiyan toned down a little. However, it was impossible for her to be Chu Liuyue\u2019s servant. \u201cTeacher Bai Chen, Chu Liuyue only entered the academy today. Even though we\u2019re in the same cohort, we shouldn\u2019t be doing this for her, right?\u201dBai Chen sneered. \u201cEven though it\u2019s her first day here, her capabilities and talent are way better than yours. In Tian Lu Academy, capabilities are the most important thing. Besides, I\u2019m just asking you to help her hold some things, yet you\u2019re so reluctant about it. Am I not a teacher in your eyes?\u201dLu Feiyan and the rest did not dare to rebut Bai Chen and could only reluctantly walk over when they realized that they could not avoid it.Lu Feiyan glanced at the horse carriage. What kind of good things can a lonely and poor household without backing have? I\u2019m worried my hands will get dirty.Chu Liuyue walked over and took out a black wooden box with flower engravings. It exuded a faint fragrance.Bai Chen took a deep breath in and felt that the fragrance had infiltrated his body and refreshed his soul. His eyes brightened. \u201cIs this lennart green?\u201d\u201cTeacher Bai Chen, you have good eyesight.\u201dLu Feiyan knitted her brows once she heard the words \u2018lennart green\u2019. Actually, when Chu Liuyue first took out the box, Lu Feiyan could smell the vague plum fragrance and guessed that it was lennart green, but she did not quite believe it.Lennart green was very precious and only lived in harsh winter, growing an inch every three years. It would only blossom after living for more than 100 years.An average person might not even be able to see it once in their lifetime, let alone have it.The girl at the side could not help but softly ask, \u201cYan\u2019er, your bracelet is also made from lennart green, right?\u201dLu Feiyan\u2019s face turned a little pale. When she first entered Tian Lu Academy, her mother specifically bought her a bracelet made from lennart green to reward her. She loved it very much and always had it with her, so the people around her all knew about it.This bracelet had attracted many envious stares. However, Chu Liuyue actually took out a wooden box made of lennart green. The box\u2019s material alone was worth a lot more than that bracelet of hers.\u201cHer wooden box costs quite a bit, right?\u201d muttered another girl.\u201cWhat do you know? There are good quality lennart greens and bad ones. This wooden box might be big, but it\u2019s probably just made with some inferior and cheap material,\u201d said Lu Feiyan with annoyance.Chu Liuyue raised her brows. \u201cOh, so Big Lu Missy has seen lennart green before. I can rest assured then; you can hold this.\u201dLu Feiyan was taken aback and suddenly felt some weight on her hands. Chu Liuyue had already placed the item on them.The box was cold to touch, and Lu Feiyan could vaguely feel the engravings on the box. The fragrance was also much stronger than before. She could not help but look down and see the intricate carvings of lively plum blossoms on the wooden box.She chuckled and could not hide her contempt. \u201cYou\u2019re really from a poor background and haven\u2019t seen much of the world. Lennart green grows very slowly and is found in cold places, so the material is cold and heavy, which helps to refresh one\u2019s mind. However, once you destroy the patterns and randomly carve something on it, the fragrance will quickly dissipate, and it\u2019ll just become a piece of rotten wood. Your lennart green is completely destroyed.\u201dChu Liuyue did not show any form of regret after hearing her words and laughed instead. \u201cEveryone says that the Lu family\u2019s wealth is incomparable, and Big Lu Missy, you\u2019re really knowledgeable. Randomly carving on lennart green will indeed spoil it easily, but this problem won\u2019t exist if one soaks it in the juice made from lennart green flowers.\u201dLu Feiyan started stuttering. \u201cW-what? Lennart green flower\u2026 juice? Soak it?\u201dLennart greens were so hard to find, let alone its flowers. She had not seen one before.\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, you can take a closer look at the plum blossom. The petals are green because of the lennart green flower juice used.\u201dLu Feiyan hurriedly looked down and indeed saw that the plum blossoms had a tinge of green. The fragrance was also especially refreshing. Lu Feiyan widened her eyes in disbelief.This\u2026 This item can really be considered super precious. Just this lennart green box alone is worth hundreds of thousands of silver taels. With that lennart green flower juice\u2026\u201cY-you\u2026\u201d Lu Feiyan was stunned, but she refused to admit defeat. She could only put up a front and said, \u201cI think this precious item of yours is your family asset, right? You even need to bring it with you everywhere in the academy\u2026\u201dChu Liuyue laughed lightly. \u201cI put tea in the box, so I must bring it along.\u201dLu Feiyan was stumped and later chuckled coldly. \u201cTea? What kind of good tea do you have?\u201d Chu Liuyue probably doesn\u2019t have any tea that is worthy of this lennart green box.Chu Liuyue nodded gently. \u201cI really don\u2019t have any good tea. I just placed some flower tea in it for me to soak my feet when I have nothing to do.\u201dLu Feiyan was stunned, taking a while to recover her senses. Her face flashed green and white at the same time, which made her look amusing. Chu Liuyue actually made me carry her feet-washing items?Liked it?

    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98: Everything She LikedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosThe worse thing is that Chu Liuyue actually used such a precious lennart green box to store the flower tea used for soaking her feet. She is simply\u2026 simply insulting this precious item!Lu Feiyan really wanted to ask Chu Liuyue what she was thinking. However, when she was about to speak up, she saw Chu Liuyue\u2019s calm expression and heard her light tone. It was as though everything was very normal and not worth mentioning.If I blow the matter out of proportion, it would seem as if I am overreacting and am not experienced enough. Lu Feiyan\u2019s blood boiled, and her chest felt as if it was blocked, making her feel like she was suffocating.Since when did I\u2014the Big Missy of the Lu family\u2014ever do things such as serve someone? She almost exploded once she recalled that the item she held contained the tea Chu Liuyue used to soak her feet.\u201cWho wants to hold such a rotten\u2026\u201d scolded Lu Feiyan as she acted as if she wanted to smash the box on the floor.\u201cBig Lu Missy, please be careful. Even though this item isn\u2019t very precious, I might have to trouble Big Lu Missy to compensate for it if it\u2019s broken.\u201d Chu Liuyue was very gentle and polite as her hand lightly tapped on the wooden box.Lu Feiyan only felt a heavy force overwhelming her and suppressing her the next moment, causing her to be unable to move.Since when did Chu Liuyue become so powerful? Also, I definitely can\u2019t produce enough money to compensate for it. She was shocked. After much internal conflict, Lu Feiyan finally released her force and said with clenched teeth, \u201cI know! It\u2019s just a lennart green box, right? What\u2019s there to be happy about?\u201dJeers could be heard from the crowd.Lu Feiyan\u2019s sentence was filled with jealousy. When she first wore the lennart green bracelet, her chin was about to fly up to the sky.Besides, Chu Liuyue\u2019s box was just used to store flower tea. The two could not even be compared.Chu Liuyue smiled in satisfaction. \u201cBig Lu Missy, you\u2019re really a sensible person.\u201d After Chu Liuyue finished her sentence, she took out something else from the horse carriage. \u201cRainbow glass cup. This item is very fragile and will crack in extreme temperatures. May I trouble you to hold this carefully?\u201d\u201cPurple jade fan. It\u2019s currently summer, and it\u2019s really hot, so it\u2019ll be good to have a fan with me.\u201d\u201cOh, this inkstone is a gold streaked inkstone that can\u2019t be directly touched with the hand. You must cushion it with a pillow made from silver thread.\u201dChu Liuyue took out several items and informed the others on the things they had to be wary of at the same time.The original arrogant Lu Feiyan and the rest were gradually dazed beyond words.Every single one of the items was extravagant. They had even only heard some of them and not seen them before.The originally angered and indignant Lu Feiyan\u2019s face became even more contorted as she stared at all the items. Initially, she thought that the lennart green box was the only presentable item Chu Liuyue had, but it was clearly not the case.Lu Feiyan felt like her chest was blocked, and her face burned as she recalled how she mocked Chu Liuyue earlier about being born in a poor family. She really wanted to dig a hole and jump into it. Even a fool could tell who the ignorant one was.If Lu Feiyan was in this state, the others were even worse. The few girls were long dazed as they stiffly held the items in their hands, not daring to move casually for fear of accidentally breaking something.They could not afford to compensate Chu Liuyue.The crowd, who was waiting to watch a scene, was also stunned.This Chu Liuyue is too much of a spendthrift\u2026Didn\u2019t she and Chu Ning sever their ties with the Chu family?Logically speaking, their pockets should be tight. However, it seems like their lives are better than most of the aristocratic families.Even Bai Chen could not help but take a few more looks at those items. He said, \u201cLittle Liuyue, I didn\u2019t know you have so many valuable items.\u201dThese were not things that could be obtained even if one had money. He wanted some of those treasures, but he could not even find a way to get them.Chu Liuyue smiled and did not say a word.How would the original Chu Liuyue have all of these? Even the Chu family might not have such treasures.Actually, she picked those things up from the boxes Second Master Yan gave her.Just based on how the things I brought out have already attracted so many people\u2019s attention, I wonder how they will react when they find out that I have more at home and that these aren\u2019t even a tenth of my items.She was already shocked when she saw that Second Master Yan had sent her so many gifts. She did not expect an even bigger surprise waiting for her when she opened them.Every single item in those boxes were extravagant treasures.The so-called \u2018prized possessions\u2019 in Zhen Bao Pavilion could not even be compared to them.Chu Liuyue could not help but re-evaluate Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2019s wealth and background.It had already been quite a few days since the Fourth Princess\u2019s mishap, but there was no news of the Emperor punishing Zhen Bao Pavilion. One could already guess quite a bit from this alone.Zhen Bao Pavilion was much more mysterious than what she thought.As the Tianling Dynasty\u2019s princess in her previous life, she used nothing but the best, so the value of these items could not shock her. However, these things\u2026 From the teacups to the ink and brushes used for writing, even the flower tea inside the lennart green box\u2026 They were all things she liked very much.Everything was coincidentally her favorite.Liked it?

    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99: Choose a TeacherPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euWithout a doubt, this was the work of the mysterious Zhen Bao Pavilion\u2019s master.Chu Liuyue was becoming increasingly curious as she wondered who the master was and why he did so much for her. This was definitely not something that could be exchanged with a hunting ground title deed.Initially, she tried to ask Yan Ge and said that she wanted to meet the Master, but was curtly rejected by Yan Ge as he said that the Master was rarely in the Imperial City. It was hard for even him to meet the Master.If Chu Liuyue wanted to meet him, she had to wait quite a while.Chu Liuyue looked at it from another perspective. Since the other party sent so many treasures over, she would just accept them. She would naturally be able to meet the other party when he wanted to meet her. It would not be too late to talk to him then.Besides, she really liked all the items, and it would be a waste if she rejected them.While looking at Lu Feiyan and the rest who were forced to surrender, Bai Chen laughed out loud. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll show you your residence.\u201d\u2026Chu Liuyue followed Bai Chen into the academy, while Lu Feiyan and the rest followed behind them, looking just like her slaves.Their group of people had attracted quite a lot of attention on the way.Even though quite a few people had seen Chu Liuyue during the previous assessment, most of them were from the same cohort as her.Chu Liuyue\u2019s name was like thunder piercing through the ears of the students in the two batches above her. Now that she finally came, they wanted to take a closer look to see what type of person she was. However, nobody was insensible enough to cause trouble for her with Bai Chen around.Chu Liuyue quickly saw many houses in the academy.These houses were all independent ones with a small yard, and they were all equally spaced apart.\u201cThe academy is very big, but we don\u2019t have a lot of students, so every student has their own house. This way, students could have their own place to cultivate in peace when they don\u2019t need to attend lessons,\u201d explained Bai Chen as he walked.\u201cIn the academy, even though the arena and library are shared amongst everyone, we have separated territories as cultivation is different for warriors, Xuan Masters, and heavenly doctors. The one we just walked past is the warriors\u2019 territory. After passing the Shuang Qing Lake, it\u2019ll be our Xuan Masters\u2019 territory.\u201dChu Liuyue looked in front and saw the clear water flowing past. A seven-hole stone bridge was situated on top of the lake.There were also individual houses on the opposite side of the river, but they clearly looked much bigger than the ones before.\u201cIt seems like the students\u2019 lodgings are also different\u2026\u201d Chu Liuyue muttered to herself.\u201cHehe, of course! Our Xuan Masters\u2019 living conditions are way better than the warriors\u2019!\u201d Bai Chen smiled happily. \u201cThe houses here are at least two times the size of those over there.\u201dChu Liuyue nodded in understanding. It was normal for such a distinction as there were limited Xuan Masters, and Xuan Masters had a higher status than warriors.\u201cLook! You\u2019ll be living in that house!\u201d Bai Chen raised his hand and pointed towards a house near the lake. \u201cIt\u2019s near to Jiuyou Tower and the library, so it\u2019s very convenient!\u201dChu Liuyue\u2019s heart tingled. \u201cThank you, Teacher Bai Chen.\u201d\u201cNo need to thank me! Elder Sun specifically instructed me to do it! It\u2019s normal to have this kind of treatment with your extremely good talent as a warrior and a Xuan Master. After all, the teachers all wish for you to become a strong person.\u201d Bai Chen looked very serious.Chu Liuyue could tell that he meant every word he said. Even though Bai Chen had a bad temper, he did not have evil intentions and did his job as a teacher dutifully.After reaching the house, Chu Liuyue could tell that the place had been meticulously cleaned, so she felt even more satisfied.When Lu Feiyan and the rest saw this, they became even more upset and left in a fury after putting the items down.Chu Liuyue did not care about them. She did not need to waste her efforts on these people.Bai Chen explained the things Chu Liuyue needed to take note of, and she wrote them down one by one.\u201cThis is your nameplate and uniform. When you\u2019re done unpacking, make a trip to Peach Garden. That\u2019s the place where teachers normally attend to their tasks. Even though you\u2019ve already chosen to cultivate as a Xuan Master, you haven\u2019t chosen your teacher. After you\u2019ve made your choice, head over to Peach Garden to meet your teacher, register on the booklet, and then you can formally cultivate.\u201dChu Liuyue thought for a while and asked, \u201cTeacher Bai Chen, must\u2026 I choose a teacher?\u201dLiked it?

Since you entered the school to cultivate, how can you not have a teacher? This is especially so for Xuan Masters as one needs detailed guidance from a teacher. If not, you\u2019ll take a long path. Why? Do\u2026 you not want to pick a teacher?\u201dChu Liuyue hemmed and hawed. Upon seeing his weird expression, she shook her head and smiled. \u201cNot really. I just asked about it casually. There are many teachers in the academy, but I\u2019m not too familiar with them as I\u2019ve just come here. So, I haven\u2019t made up my mind for now.\u201dBai Chen did not doubt that she had another reason for asking this as he laughed out loud. \u201cOh, so that\u2019s the case! Actually, you don\u2019t need to be so conflicted. It\u2019s not too late to choose when you see the teachers individually at Peach Garden.\u201dChu Liuyue heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cThen, I\u2019m assured.\u201dBai Chen winked. \u201cActually, most of the students are like you when they first enter the academy and know nothing about the teachers. However, their range of choices isn\u2019t as big as yours. You took first place in the warrior assessment and second place in the Xuan Master assessment. All the teachers want to have you as their disciple now, so it\u2019s up to you to choose. Not everyone can have this treatment.\u201dOnly a rare talent like Chu Liuyue could stir up all those people\u2019s desires.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go over after unpacking my things.\u201d\u2026Chu Liuyue\u2019s residence was a very clean two-story building.She scanned her surroundings and discovered that everything she needed was already prepared for her. She did not need to bring anything along. However, she still placed her items neatly and changed into the academy uniform with the nameplate on her left chest area. Then, she walked towards Peach Garden.Bai Chen had already told Chu Liuyue how to go to Peach Garden, so she arrived there smoothly.From far away, Chu Liuyue already saw a traditional and spacious building.When Chu Liuyue stood outside the door, she suddenly felt immense pressure coming straight for her. She focused her gaze but did not move. She stood still instead.Hua!The harsh aura suddenly disappeared when it almost reached her face. The remaining wind blew up the loose strands of hair in front of her forehead.Chu Liuyue stood there calmly and cupped her fists. \u201cGreetings, teachers.\u201dDeep laughter sounded at the next moment.\u201cI said this girl has true capabilities, yet you insisted on testing her. You\u2019re not even afraid of being ridiculed by her.\u201d It was Sun Zhongyan\u2019s voice. \u201cGirl, come in.\u201dAfter he finished his sentence, the invisible force in front of Chu Liuyue vanished completely. She then stepped into the building.Unlike its name, Peach Garden had no plants or flowers, only rough rocks haphazardly placed around. However, Chu Liuyue could immediately tell that the rocks formed a special Xuan formation.With this place as the center, the Xuan formation energy exuded in all directions. The Xuan formation\u2019s power could definitely not be underestimated once activated.Chu Liuyue quickly retracted her gaze.Sun Zhongyan sat on a stone bench in the building and placed a chess piece down when he saw her enter.Chu Liuyue noticed that the chessboard was exactly the same as the one she used to enter Tian Lu Academy. However, today\u2019s chess pieces were scattered around like stars in the sky, clearly much more complicated than the chessboard that day.\u201cGirl, have you chosen your teacher?\u201dAfter hesitating slightly, Chu Liuyue shook her head. \u201cTeacher Bai Chen told me to come over and meet all the teachers.\u201d As she was talking, she scanned her surroundings and discovered that nobody else other than Elder Sun was in the yard.However, some hidden aura was in the building\u2026\u201cElder Sun, the other teachers\u2026\u201d Chu Liuyue was confused.Sun Zhongyan pointed towards the chessboard. \u201cSince everyone wanted to be your mentor, we held a small competition. Now, all of them have lost, and I\u2019m the only one left.\u201d He smiled and looked at Chu Liuyue. \u201cWhat do you think of me being your teacher?\u201dChu Liuyue was slightly stunned. If she did not remember wrongly, Elder Sun was also Si Ting\u2019s teacher.When she was hesitating, a gray shadow suddenly dropped down from a distance, and a deep voice boomed like thunder in Peach Garden. \u201cI disagree!\u201dLiked it?
