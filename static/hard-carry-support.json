    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 - The Wrong Job (1)Clang!The moment the blade slashed empty space, the world got split.The ground shook, and part of the dimension was cut off.This happened after SeoHyun's ultimate attack, \u00abSpace Divider\u00bb, was activated.Tens of thousands of monsters were oxidized at once into darkness.The sword that had just slashed many demons began emanating white light.Asra Online.SeoHyun, who had kept the number one position in the rankings for many years, was about to clear a quest.'I can beat it.'In the past, 40 rankers had tried to beat this quest, but they had gotten defeated as soon as the battle started, so they were forced to walk away from it.But SeoHyun was about to beat that quest alone.He had been planning this assault for three months, so he felt very confident.'I just have to make no mistakes.'Whish-\u00a0SeoHyun jumped at the enemy's forces. He impaled the air and activated the chained skill of his ultimate attack.\u00abDimension Breakthrough\u00bb.The light emanating from the sword cleared all the visible opponents.All kinds of monsters were wiped out in a single attack\u2014from trash mobs to elite monsters; even named bosses disappeared while screaming.The laser-like attack pierced all the hills and reached up to space.'Yes!'SeoHyun celebrated the success.His ultimate attack had successfully pierced the great demon Keidrial's heart.'I've almost cleared everything up.'What was left was defeating monsters that were still standing, but most of them were on the verge of death.SeoHyun slowly killed the enemies that were left, one by one.A couple of hours later, he had finally defeated the quest's final boss.[You've successfully cleared the quest 'Demon World Annihilation'!][You've single-handedly ended a multi-dimensional war that has been going on since 1836! Everyone in the heavens will praise your accomplishment!]\"Oof...\"After hearing the mission cleared message, SeoHyun smiled bitterly.He had just accomplished something that most people couldn't even fathom. Despite this, he didn't seem happy. The reason was simple.<Total Amount of Players Online: 287>By coincidence, he saw the current server's status in the lower part of the screen.'Another person has quit.'He was the number one player of Asra Online!He was the emperor who had managed to conquer all 21 castles.\u2014All users and members of different races looked up to him.With one step, he managed to clear a castle, and with another, received the cheering of tens of thousands.SeoHyun, an average first-year university student, was the king of the world of Asra Online.But the king's world was somewhat shabby.Asra Online only had 300 users online at one time.Video games resembled the water's flow. Just like a stream of water flows in and then spreads in the ocean, most games have new players coming in. Then, some users get tired and stop logging in\u2014this is how the pluses and minuses were balanced.Once new players disappear, the water that doesn't flow stagnates.Since no new users are coming in, the entry barrier becomes higher.Then, users are left with two choices: either leave or resist.The moment new users stop showing up, the game basically becomes their private league.The ecosystem stagnates and starts to rot.The Asra continent was rapidly decaying, and SeoHyun was the emperor of that dying continent.'Why is nobody playing such a fun game...?'\u2018I just can't understand.\u2019A planetary-level scale and vast world-building\u2026A Well-written story and countless easter eggs\u2026It was as if they'd used the most advanced artificial intelligence to create each NPC\u2014they were all very humanlike and had characteristics that made them unique.There's no reason not to play this game.'Is it because it wasn't originally made for virtual reality?'From what they said, Asra Online was first developed as a PC game, but because of popular demand, developers quickly ported it to 3D Virtual Reality.The problem was that many similar games released around the same time were made for virtual reality from the beginning.For Asra Online, it was hard to survive in this era where capsules and virtual reality games had become widespread. The bad user interface and poor graphics were Asra Online's fatal weaknesses.'If only Asra Online had been developed as a VR game from the beginning...!'He felt angry.If only it had been able to gain some popularity from the beginning, there would be at least ten thousand players online.He thought about deleting his account many times, but in the end, SeoHyun couldn't give up on Asra Online.For eight years, he had focused on one game.SeoHyun couldn't move on from Asra Online.But one day\u2026A new opportunity was presented in front of SeoHyun, the king of a dying game.<Pre-orders for Asrian Online are open>\u2018What is this...?\u2019Just like any other day, SeoHyun had accessed the online community boards of Asra Online. An advertisement with an eye-catching font caught his attention.'Asrian...?'His hands were shaking. After he clicked on the advertisement, a page opened.\"What?\"SeoHyun's eyes couldn't believe what they were seeing.There, he could see Gluna, Asra's moon. The purple light it emanated was illuminating the background of the page.In the sky behind the floating castle, you could see an ancient dragon fighting a Divine Mage, one of the top jobs for a magician. He was attacking the dragon with a pillar of fire. Sparks were flying everywhere. Underneath that, a number so big that it was hard to read was going up continuously.<World First Sensory Synchronization Mechanism! Pre-Orders for Asrian Online are open>Amount of Pre-Orders: 78,739,952.'Sensory Synchronization? Are they referring to that same technology that was recently covered on the news?'Even if it was called Virtual Reality, it only covered two of the five senses: sight and hearing. Compared to reality, it was lackluster. If you wanted to move, you had to use the controllers and not your muscles.But a few months ago, there was news in which they had said that a realistic virtual reality that satisfies all five senses had been developed. Gamers were excited.'No way...'After calming down his rapidly beating heart, he searched for Asrian on YouTube.\"This is crazy.\"The teaser video of Asrian Online had been viewed 108,374,234 times. He hadn't started watching the video, but he already felt intimidated.SeoHyun became immersed in the video.The 20-minute video was so great that SeoHyun became dumbfounded.He couldn't believe what his eyes were seeing\u2014NPCs he knew very well were moving three-dimensionally.'Is this really footage from a video game?'It was more realistic than the CG of a movie. One wouldn't guess that they took the scene from a video game.Asra Online had been reborn as a real virtual reality game.But it wasn't your average crappy virtual reality. Unlike others, it used cutting-edge technology!SeoHyun became so overwhelmed by feelings that he almost cried.The 20-minute video finished playing.That short video was good enough to know that everything\u2014including the story, world-building, system, and gameplay\u2014was perfect.'Did NFM have enough money to build such a great quality game?'NFM.It was a medium-sized company; its only source of income was the 300 active players of Asra Online.SeoHyun had doubts about how they could've built a game like this. But he quickly stopped thinking about it.'That's not for me to worry about.'<Pre-orders for Asrian Online are open>Amount of Pre-Orders: 79,634,754In just a few minutes, pre-orders had gone up by a million.From what he could see, the pre-orders must have started that day since the number was going up very fast.SeoHyun smiled.While reading what was written under the number, he kept opening and closing his hands.<Asrian Online, available worldwide on May 1st!>One week from then, Asra Online would be reborn as Asrian Online.Nobody would be able to make fun and call it a dying game from that moment on.\u2018I'm going to show you the skills of the number one player.\u2019That night, he couldn't sleep because of the excitement.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *SeoHyun wasn't planning to play Asrian Online half-heartedly.'There's going to be at least tens of millions of players...! There will probably be many professional gamers among the users. By playing casually, I won't be able to get far.'The following days were some of the most intense in SeoHyun's life.At first, he tried to get more information on the official page, but he soon became disappointed.'There's only basic stuff here. There's no useful information.'It was as if they were planning a surprise on the opening day\u2014they were hiding all information very well.There was no information about jobs, skills, or items; the explanation about the world was also very poor.The only information available was about changing the user interface or settings.'I won't be able to get any useful data here.'SeoHyun changed his focus to the community boards.Korea's biggest online community was already very active.<Daily Asrian Online opening hype post. Only five days leefffttttt! (0)><Warning! If you click on this post, you'll be linked to the world of Asrian (5)>Most posts were useless posts, but once he entered the popular section, threads with helpful information started to appear.<Teaser Video Analysis! (349)>SeoHyun clicked on the video that was on the top of the page.The user 'Stuck in a Dying Game' started the thread by presenting himself first.- I'm known in video games as Steel Rock. I'm an active player of Asra Online, which is the previous game made by NFM, the people who made Asrian Online.SeoHyun tried to remember him.'Steel Rock? Is he maybe that guy?'He was one of Asra Online's rankers but not a high-ranking one.That was because all Asra Online players were rankers.The fact that he remembered the user ID of most rankers was a grim reminder of how few people played that game.All users on the server knew each other\u2014they were either friends from the same guild or enemies from opposing ones. It definitely sounded more like a social/chatting game than anything.'There really isn't a game in a worse state than that one.'SeoHyun left the bittersweetness behind and kept reading.- I guess everyone has seen the video of the magician fighting the dragon, right? The floating castle that you can see in the background is called Lacrenzel. The ancient dragon Kerber makes an appearance as a named enemy. As you can see, he's using \u00abTriple Fire Brass\u00bb. But... This skill is the same as the one he uses in Asra Online!Steel Rock had attached two screenshots, which added credibility to what he said.He also commented on similarities between the NPCs and skill effects.- By now, you should've noticed. It seems that Asra and Asrian Online share more than the world. They probably also share things like skills of the different classes and quests, among other things.SeoHyun nodded in agreement.He had thought the same things as Steel Rock while watching the video.From what he'd seen, there were many similarities, but there were some differences\u2014mainly new places and skills.Even if there were differences, right now, when there was no information about Asrian Online, the possible similarities were very important.'There are five days left.'SeoHyun was about to enter Asra Online to gather more information. What he saw on the login page surprised him<Total Amount of Players Online: 4323>'What's happening?'The number of people inside Asra Online was the highest he had ever seen.It felt like he was back on launch day.After seeing ten times more players than normal, he became tempted.'What would happen if I, the number one player of Asra Online, started streaming right now?'But after thinking about it for a while, he decided not to do it.'I could probably acquire some wealth and fame because the number of people interested in the game has increased.'The downside was that if he started streaming, he would end up revealing a lot of information.All the information he had acquired through the years was too valuable to give away for some clout.From hidden items to the best skill sets, he also knew about the location of NPCs that gave you hidden quests. It was information that only he, the number one player, knew. It was all thanks to the fact that he could freely move in normally hidden places.He couldn't just give away that type of information.For the people that were just starting, that information would probably be as valuable as gold.'I shouldn't broadcast.'After SeoHyun reached that conclusion, he decided to log in. His character was standing in the middle of space.He warped five times and landed in a secret place.After extending his arm to the void, the space started to change, and the gravity barrier crumbled.A dimensional door opened. From inside it, you could see a blue light coming out.The Library of Knowledge.This was a place where you could find all the information and knowledge about Asra Online.SeoHyun, who was familiar with this place, entered the other dimension.Armed angels guarded the entrance gate; they bowed their heads. Even the emperor of Acresia couldn't stop him from going there.Among all the players of Asra Online, only SeoHyun had access to this place.'There's no need to be grandiose.'SeoHyun couldn't find any new useful information.He just remembered the past eight years.Thankfully, he had access to everything in the Library.SeoHyun read about Asra's history; he also checked out the theory behind magics, skills, and how to combine them.He also tried to remember all the magical beasts spread across the world.SeoHyun tried to remember as much about Asra as he could. At the same time, he looked back at the eight years he had spent playing the game. After all, this was his farewell.While doing that, five days flew by.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 -\u00a0 The Wrong Job (2)It was the long-awaited opening day of Asrian Online.People from all sorts of gaming communities were excited.Thanks to people searching for strategies and users that streamed their gameplays, the communities remained very active.- Wow... Servers aren't lagging at all.- You're right. Usually, when you begin playing, it lags so much that the server enters maintenance.- Is this the power of innovation? This is the first game with Sensory Synchronization, right?- I've managed to get the ID 'Legend.' I'm selling it for USD 1000.- This game allows duplicate IDs, lol.- Really? I was happy after obtaining the ID 'Love' \u3160\u3160.- The amount of users is in the tens of millions. If it didn't allow duplicate IDs, you wouldn'tbe able to create a decent one.SeoHyun felt restless while watching the virtual reality capsule in the corner of his room.Even though Asrian Online had launched, he hadn't started playing it\u2014he had a very goodreason for that. Before starting, there was something he wanted to know.That something was job selection.In Asra Online, you had to select your job at level 1.You could upgrade your character's job, but you couldn't change it. Not only that butresetting the settings wasn't even an option.There was an option to add another character slot via DLC, but the price for that was 100 USD\u2014it was three times higher than what it cost in Asra Online.They were charging that because they could, but it was a lot of money for SeoHyun, who was struggling with that month's living expenses.Since he didn't have any friends, his parents were the only ones he could ask for money.- Wow. As soon as you start, an NPC comes out and picks your job, lol.- Yeah, I was also surprised by that.SeoHyun's eyes shone with interest.After scrolling down a little bit more, he finally found the information he was looking for.- It seems like you can choose between four jobs. The Angel NPC guides you through theprocess. But to give a brief explanation: if you choose a sword, you become a warrior, if youpick up a magic wand, you become a magician, and so on.- I ignored the NPC and just grabbed a random thing. I ended up becoming a priest, lol.- In my case, I became a thief.- To become a thief, you have to pick the short sword, right?- Yes.Asrian Online had been open for about 10 minutes, but the online communities were inchaos because of the job selection.SeoHyun felt relieved.\"Just as I thought, waiting was the correct answer.\"He was afraid that the new game might have a different way of doing certain things.After reading that your class got chosen the moment you picked up a weapon, he feltrelieved by deciding to wait and not to log in.\"Good. I've learned how to pick jobs...\"It was time to be at the forefront by exploring and completing quests.He read a couple more posts and then walked towards the capsule and laid down.[Do you want to log in to Asrian Online?]\"Yes.\"[Loading.]Whish-Soon, he couldn't see anything but darkness. SeoHyun felt like he was floating in the air.At first, he felt uneasy. But after hearing the calm system message, he could continue withthe set-up.[Please enter the username you're going to use in Asrian Online]\"Hyun.\"[Setting Complete!]When SeoHyun opened his eyes, rather than the capsule's walls, he saw what looked like acastle soaked in darkness.A silent blackness covered the entire palace.\"Has it started?\"Hyun tried to move.Walking alone in a dark castle late at night made him feel like an assassin.Hyun was looking around when a bright light made him frown.'Ugh!'The traces of light gathered and formed a set of wings. What appeared next was a humanoidlife form\u2014it was an angel who was glowing.\"Welcome, being from another dimension.\"He could hear a soprano voice directly in his mind.It was his first time hearing another person's voice in his mind; it reminded him of one ofthose martial arts novels.But that wasn't what surprised him the most.SeoHyun already knew that an angel appeared in front of you as soon as you started thegame, but he never thought that it would be a female angel.'What a moment, is she...?'He had already met this angel in Asra Online.Yes, it was definitely her.Subconsciously, he called her by her real name.\"Keidrial...?\"The names of most angels ended with -el, but the names of demons ended with -al.Her angelic form\u2019s name was Keiruel\u2026But her real name was that of a demon.The fact that she was a demon was revealed in the latter half of the story.\"From now on, you'll be able to experience more than...\"After Hyeon said her real name, her voice that was as kind as a mother's faded out.The glow that symbolized an angel went out like a candle.Crash-!Her beautiful wings broke into polygon-shaped pieces.The statue of the angel that was blocking the way collapsed and disappeared.The voice of the angel sounded like an artificially modified and distorted one.\"So, you know my name? How did you know~?\"Keidrial spread out a pair of black wings.SeoHyun could hear her creepy but playful voice. His body was getting excited on its own.He knew why.Keidrial could make one hallucinate. She had this special ability because she was a named creature.The Sensory Synchronization functionality could manipulate human emotions, but it was ata non-harmful level for humans.That was also the reason why he felt pressured.Even though his heart was beating fast, he tried to calm down and order his thoughts.'In the communities, everyone said that an 'Angel' had appeared before them.'She had horns and black wings.If anyone could call her angel after seeing these, they should definitely get their sightchecked out.That meant one thing: people didn't know about Keidrial's real identity.Nobody had revealed her true self.Even in Asra Online, she was the last named NPC to appear. So he was probably the only one that knew about this.\"I got caught? Oh well, there's nothing I can do about it now. You should be grateful that youwere able to see this form.\"Keidrial laughed in such a way that it was hard to tell if she was having fun or feeling annoyed while looking at Hyun.\"Now, please pick your job and get out of here, human.\"She pointed to four items that were on top of a desk.There was a sword, a dagger, a wand, and a cross.They were items that allowed you to become a warrior, a thief, a magician, or a priest.Hyun looked at Keidrial with suspicion.'Is this really all?'An event that suddenly happened\u2026In Asra Online, when a secret event happened, usually something special appeared.There was always a special reward or another linked event behind things that were hidden.'There's probably something more here.'SeoHyun stopped and started looking around.'What's that?'Behind the demon, he could see something of great quality.It was a red carpet.\u2026But the length of it was unnaturally short.\u2018Shouldn't the carpet of a palace like this be longer?\u2019On top of it, he saw something that was a little bit too small and asymmetrical to call acushion.It was as if a piece of it was cut out.'What's this?'That place had appeared where the statue of an angel was standing. That meant that itwasn't visible while Keidrial was hiding her identity.When she turned into a demon, the statue of the angel disappeared, and that space thatwas hidden became visible.'Should I take a closer look at it?'Hyun slowly walked towards where the red carpet had appeared in order to take a closerlook.Keidrial, who saw what he was about to do, started to panic and shouted at him.\"Wait...!\"'Huh?'\"What are you doing? Why aren't you choosing your job?\"He looked back at Keidrial, who was trying to rush him into making a decision.\u2018Is she feeling uneasy?\u2019 It wasn't normal to see her like this.\u2018Maybe...?\u2019Hyun smiled maliciously.\"There's something I wanted to take a closer look at.\"\"There's nothing over there.\"\"We'll see about that.\"Hyun got closer and stepped on the carpet.At that moment\u2014[You've found a hidden place!][The number of jobs from which you can pick has increased!]In the empty place, torches appeared, and a new space showed itself.He could see a throne at the end of the red carpet that had looked unnaturally short before.The red carpet had looked short because there was a hidden place at its end.\"...\"Keidrial remained silent.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Was it because he had discovered the hidden place? She was glaring at him with scaryeyes.Even those eyes couldn't keep him from being excited.\"This is awesome!\"While walking on the red carpet and looking around, Hyun couldn't hide his smile.The number of jobs from which you could pick was more than four!These were probably upgraded or hidden jobs!He could see more than a dozen of item, and they were all probably job-relateditems.'Hmm?'After getting to the end of the red carpet, SeoHyun started to wonder about another thing.The demon that had deceived him, Keidrial, had rapidly placed herself behind the throne.Normally, he wouldn't have thought much about it. But at that moment, he couldn't help but think that Keidrial was there because she wanted to hide something.\"Why aren't you choosing your job? After all, there are a lot of hidden ones around here.You should be satisfied with anything you pick up.\"\"Wait...\"Hyun looked at Keidrial with suspicion.\"Can you please move away?\"\"Wh... Why do I need to do that?\"He laughed at Keidrial's reaction.He found it somewhat cute that an evil demon couldn't control her emotions.\"Then just stay there.\"He stepped inside the place that Keidrial was guarding. But surprisingly, they didn't bump.There, in that job picking place, the user's will was the most important thing. That's why shecouldn't do anything to stop him, including physically.Hyun walked through Keidrial and found a sword stuck in a marble.\"Ah...!\"Hyun was awed by the sword. He could tell at a glance that the sword was at another level!The sword was emitting a dark red light.\"What kind of job does this give?\"It was hard to tell, even for someone with eight years of experience.In Asra Online, he had a job called Dimension Crasher.That job, which was the last upgrade, allowed him to destroy anything.Maybe this job could have the same... No, at least similar destructive power to the one heused to have.There was no doubt remaining in his mind. Hyun extended his hand and grabbed the sword.Black energy emanated from the sword and covered Hyun.He should have thought about it more carefully.Keidrial was a demon.According to the lore of Asra, she was a demon that gained pleasure by deceiving humansand devouring their desperation.[Congratulations! You've picked the hidden job 'Support'!]\"Huh...?\"It was as if the system was laughing at the dumbfounded Hyun.[You've finished your first job selection!][You can get more character slots in the cash shop for 100 USD!]Keidrial started to laugh at him.\"Hahahahaha~!\"\u2018Support?\u2019\u2018What? Is this a hidden camera prank?\u2019After coming back to his senses, the first thing he saw was Keidrial, who was dying oflaughter.\"Hahaha, that job may unexpectedly be good, so do your best!\"Zap-Keidrial, who was laughing at him until the very last moment, disappeared.After being left alone, Hyun could feel his body being forcefully transported to another place.He couldn't help but shout out in sorrow.\"Fuuuuccckkkkk~!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 -\u00a0 Support's Breakthrough (1)After being backstabbed by Keidrial, SeoHyun logged out.'100 USD... It's a lot of money, but I think that I can afford it.'He decided to eat ramen for the rest of the week and bought another character slot.'This time, I'll definitely pick a cheat class!'He broke out into cold sweat when he entered the character picking room.'Huh...? Where is Keidrial...?'He couldn't see anyone in the place where either an angel or a demon should be standing. The hidden place was also nowhere to be seen.Warrior, Thief, Magician, Priest...He could only see the items necessary to pick one out of the four jobs.'No way... Each account gets only one chance?!'It didn't take him long to realize that his suspicion was true.Boom!SeoHyun, who was having a mental breakdown, came out of the capsule and grabbed his hair.A Support?!Even if his job changed in the future, it would probably still be some kind of supporting role. For example: Expert Support, Legendary Support, Support of Darkness, Moonlight Support, etc.'But why?'He had definitely chosen a red greatsword.It was the type of weapon that seemed capable of beating everything and everyone\u2014a job fit for a damage dealer.But Support?How could such a weapon symbolize the job of a Support?\"Oof...\"SeoHyun took a bottle of cold water from the fridge and drank it.He calmed down and placed himself in the capsule again.He was tempted to start the game with a normal job for a moment, but after thinking about it, he decided to give it a chance. After all, making a decision before taking a better look at the job would be silly.'Even if it's a support, it's still a hidden job. Right?'He tried to be positive about his current situation.'Is it possible that the Support's ability is better than it seems? In the first place, its item is an amazing greatsword.'SeoHyun rapidly logged in again.[You've logged in to Asra Online!]As soon as he successfully logged in, Hyun opened his status window.Hyun (Lv. 1)HP: 50/50Mana: 100/100[Strength: 2] [Agility: 2] [Vitality: 5] [Magical Power: 10] [Empathy: 27]Skills - <+Open List>\"...Hm.\"Hyun fell into silence for a little while.Even though he was still in the first line of the status window, his job had many issues.'Okay, I'm going to decide after reading the skills.'[ \u00abThe Heavenly God's Protection Lv.0\u00bb ]- You can increase the defense of a selected target by 50+(Empathy/10).- It lasts for one second.<Cooldown Time: 10 seconds>[ \u00abShield Lv.0\u00bb ]- Cover a selected target with a protective shield.- Opponents that attack the shield lose their conscience for 3 seconds+ (Empathy/500) seconds.- If the target gets hit, the cooldown time gets reduced by 5 seconds.<Cooldown Time 600 seconds>Hyun closed the status window.What came out of his mouth were insults.\"What the fuck is this?!\"There was a reason for his anger.First of all, the job had amazing stats\u2026 Amazing in a bad sense.\"What is empathy?\"He had played Asra Online for almost eight years, but it was his first time seeing a nonsensical stat like that.Not only that, but the rest of the stats were also very low.\"Only 2 in strength and agility? Are these stats even possible?\"In Asra Online, most jobs had a base stat of at least 15 points, though there were some exceptions. For example, the Warrior had a Magical Power of 2, and the Magician began the game with 5 in health.Basically, the Support had the worst stats out of all current jobs available in the game.Most stats were probably low because of the Support's exclusive 'empathy' stat. He wouldn't complain if that stat were actually useful, but that didn't seem to be the case.First of all, \u00abThe Heavenly God's Protection\u00bb.It increased defense by 50 points for one second.50 points of defense were actually very high. It was comparable to the defense that a level 150 knight had.Up until level 80 or 90, there wouldn't be any monster capable of dealing damage. So, in the beginning, it would make anyone practically immortal.The problem was the duration.\"Hmm... A duration of one second, huh?\"Hyun changed the name \u00abThe Heavenly God's Protection\u00bb to \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb.\"Well, at least I'll be able to use it to defend myself from one hit.\"Hyun gave the skill \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb an almost perfect score.Next skill, \u00abShield\u00bb.It was a counter-attacking skill.The 3-second stun seemed useful, but if you looked at what it did carefully, it wasn't hard to see that it was a trash skill.The duration was the same as the other one, one second.But the issue was that the cooldown time was 10 minutes.The shield was only activated when an opponent hit you; that meant even if you used \u00abShield\u00bb, you needed to be attacked by an opponent almost immediately. If not, you had to wait 10 minutes.A cold sweat rolled down from his ears.He just couldn't think of a good way to use the Support class.\"Shouldn't they give me at least one offensive skill? Or a healing one. Does this mean that a Support isn't even a healer?\"If he had received the Healer job, he would have been able to join a party and have an easy time.For example, the Support seemed to be more fit for a simple job, like picking up items.\"Should I just make a new character? No, I should at least try to obtain the ultimate attack.\"Hyun decided to calm down and give it another chance.At level 50, all jobs learned an ultimate attack.Since it was a hidden class, its ultimate attack could be special.No! It had to be special!After Hyun set a goal, he became more motivated.He took out the 'Newbie's Dagger' from his inventory. And after that, he walked outside of the Starter Town.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The 'Transparent Slime' used Body Slam!Hyun didn't avoid its attack. Not because he couldn't but because he didn't need to.\u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb!Boing - The Transparent Slime bounced away after hitting Hyun.Neither the slime nor Hyun were hurt.Hyun counter-attacked. The Newbie's Dagger slashed through the slime's body.[You've successfully dealt 3 damage!]The slime seemed to be hurt but nothing fatal. After all, slimes had a vitality of 100 points and a regenerative ability.Once Hyun's attack had finished, the Transparent Slime attacked him again. When it was about to hit him, he activated another skill.\u00abShield\u00bb!The slime hit the protective shield and made a loud noise. You could see stars going around in circles on top of its head.The protective shield that lasted for one second had the ability to knock out any opponent that tried to attack him.The issue was that it didn't stop the opponents from damaging him.[You've received 10 damage!]He sacrificed some vitality to knock out the opponent for three seconds.During that short period of time, he managed to land two attacks on the slime.[You've dealt 3 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 5 damage!]Once the time was up, the slime woke up and prepared to attack again.Hyun used \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb again.Boing - The slime bounced away once more.The same things happened for around five minutes. And then, finally\u2026Squeak!\u00a0- After making a sound similar to a mouse, the slime was defeated.Hyun enjoyed the victory after a battle that lasted for 10 minutes.Hyun looked at the rewards he had gained.[You've obtained 5 experience points]Next to Hyun, another player that had just come out from Starter Town was fighting a slime.He watched the new player.Hyun thought that the other user must be a Warrior. After all, he used a level 1 skill called \u00abStrike\u00bb, which was exclusive to the warrior job.The moment he used \u00abStrike\u00bb again on the slime with a Newbie's Dagger.Boom-!His attack made a clear and loud sound. It was a critical hit.Just two attacks\u2026The slime exploded.Dumbfounded, Hyun saw the Warrior run away in search of the next monster.\"Screw this game.\"Hyun was able to kill 10 slimes in two hours. During that time, he was able to obtain three slime essence and 50 experience points.The Warrior, however, had killed a Slime in a few seconds and ran past him.\"Not worth it.\"Hyun threw away the Newbie's Dagger, but he regretted it immediately, so he picked it up again.'This isn't going to work. Should I try to join a party?'If he talked to someone that looked nice, that person might accept incorporating him into the party.But as the former number 1, he didn't like the idea of using such a petty strategy.He laid down on the grass and closed his eyes.A few users walking nearby looked at him with weird eyes, but Hyun didn't notice that.He was lost in his thoughts.What he had was a lot of knowledge about Asra Online.He didn't necessarily have to level up by grinding like everyone else.What he had to do was use his knowledge and experience. If not, he wouldn't be able to catch up with everyone else.Hyun started to navigate through Asra in his mind.The first continent, Asra\u2026Among the five nations, he should begin with the Erant Kingdom.Hyun tried to remember everything about the Erant Kingdom.21 castles... Towns... NPCs... Types of monsters that appeared... He tried to remember every single detail.Since he couldn't find the answer he was looking for, he started to explore another place using his mind.The Lanpurus Empire.It had 63 different areas. It was by far the continent's biggest country; that's why it always had many things going on, and a wide variety of monsters appeared in that place.Mercenaries of Reus... Magical Tower... The Empire's Academy... The continent's biggest workshop...He tried to remember even the hidden areas.The Floating Gardens... The Altar... The Thread of Destiny... The Lake of Evil Spirits...He thought a lot about the different places available.After a while, he seemed to have found the answer. The look in his eyes had changed.\"Maybe... I can do it...\"He simulated the possible outcome in his head.Hyun perfected his strategy little by little, and every time it improved, his heart started beating faster.\"It might actually work!\"Hyun stood up.After going through the entire world of Asra, he finally had a clue. It was a tiny one, but thanks to his calculations, it seemed like something he could pull off.There was a hunt that only a Support could do!If everything went according to his plan, he wouldn't need to hunt slimes anymore.* * *Asra and Asrian Online had a special newbie bonus.Users below level 5 could use the teleport gate for free once.That benefit was designed to help newbie users.You started at a random town inside the Asra continent when you created a new character.Most of the time, the town where you start your adventures is decided by your IP location.But there could be exceptions.You could also start your adventure in an area that was in the middle of a conflict or a place where strong monsters appeared.If you started the game in a high-difficulty area, you wouldn't be able to do anything.That's why they gave users one chance to teleport themselves and change their starting town.Some people used this benefit to teleport to their friends, but the important thing here was that every character under level 5 received the ability to use the teleport gate once free of charge.That was the starting point of Hyun's idea.'If I can use teleport to get out of a dangerous place, I should be able to do the reverse.'Hyun easily found the teleport gate building.The Magician in charge of the gate looked at Hyun with suspicion.\"Are you out of your mind? It seems like you're a new 'user.' That place isn't for you. In order to survive there, you need to be at level 60 minimum.\"Hyun smiled bitterly.He probably looked like a newbie who didn't know anything about the world or someone suicidal.But he didn't want to explain his reasoning to the Magician, nor did he care about what the other person thought.\"Mind your own business.\"The Magician's face became red.\"I shouldn't have tried giving advice to a crazy person like you. I'll send you there immediately. Oh, by the way. Going there it's free, but if you want to come back, it will cost you 200 gold.\"Hyun stepped inside the Magic Circle. After the Magician moved his hand, he disappeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 -\u00a0 Support's Breakthrough (2)He had arrived at Kantas Castle, which was in a territory near the 'Magic Country Levia.'The weakest monster around there was at level 60. It also wasn't among the towns where users started the game, so he was the only player in that place.The ghost monsters that appeared there were immune to physical attacks\u2014that's why the place wasn't suited for newbies.Despite all of that, Hyun was smiling while looking at the ghosts.\"Hmm... It feels nice.\"The target Hyun had in mind was a level 80 monster called 'Ghost Archer.'The fortress in front of him was full of them.\"Ghost Archers, huh? They're probably one of the worst possible enemies for newbies.\"Those monsters, on their own, were quite stupid. But they shared consciousness, just like the alien race from a certain old classic game.The worst among those monsters was the elite one that had the skill 'Lead.'\u00abAll-Out Attack\u00bb.Since the ghost monsters shared consciousness, under the guidance of an elite monster, they could perform tasks such as attacking simultaneously.Even players over level 100 had a difficult time deflecting hundreds of arrows at the same time, so they frequently died without being able to heal.That's why that place, 'The Ghost Fortress,' was called the cemetery of healers.Hyun was planning to use the \u00abAll-Out Attack\u00bb in his favor.\"First, I should test my strategy. Just in case.\"While walking towards The Ghost Fortress, Hyun found the first Ghost Archer.He grabbed its attention by throwing a rock to where it was standing. The Ghost Archer immediately reacted by launching an arrow at him.Swish\u00a0- The arrow flew towards him, and Hyun activated his skill just in time.\u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb!'That skill increased his defensive points by 50; that amount was enough to resist up to 500 damage up-front.That meant that, during the beginning, he was practically immortal.The Ghost Archer\u2019s arrow bounced away without being able to inflict any damage on him.'Just as I thought. I don't take any damage.'Swoop- The second arrow flew towards him.The Ghost Archer took more than 10 seconds before attacking again. So just like the first time, it didn't inflict any damage on him.Thuck- Ting -!Thuck- Ting -!\"Hehehe...\"Just like a masochist, he laughed while being hit with arrows.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Every time he got shot with an arrow, he laughed.After spending 10 minutes like that, he walked towards Kantas Castle.Boooo-The ghosts followed him while making noises, but Hyun just let them be until they reached the castle's walls.\"What is that?\"On top of the walls of Kantas Castle\u2026A soldier of the Magic Country frowned after seeing a random person and a ghost approach the walls.\"Captain, there's a ghost approaching the wall.\"\"You don't need to inform me of such trivial things. Just eliminate it!\"\"Yes, sir!\"Flash-!The light of sacred magic covered the area, and at the same time, another light covered Hyun's body.[Level Up!]Hyun smiled.He could level up without doing anything, thanks to Asrian Online's experience-sharing system.If two people that weren\u2019t in a party killed a monster, how much exp you received depended on how much you collaborated.\u2014How much damage you'd dealt or how much you've taken from the monster.Successful healing or crowd control was also counted when distributing experience points. This system was put in place for tankers who took the damage and healers.Hyun had gained experience because he had received arrows for 10 minutes; that was also why he was smiling while being attacked with arrows.\"The experience I can obtain with one ghost should be around 200.\"Hyun looked at his experience bar.Even after gaining two levels, the bar was half-full.The Ghost Archer gave 4000 experience. That meant he was gaining 5% of it for collaborating.\"It's not bad.\"At that speed, he was gaining experience four times faster than a level 1 Warrior.But he wasn't satisfied with just this.He was planning to use as much of his knowledge and experience as possible.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Hyun was deep into the Ghost Fortress.Ghosts were dumb. That's why infiltrating into their territory was relatively easy.\"Going through.\"Hyun was walking right behind the ghosts while matching their walking speed.Since most ghosts\u2019 intellectual ability was at the level of a slime, they didn't notice Hyun.\"Finally, I've found him.\"Hyun managed to slip away from the ghosts and discovered one dressed differently.The 'Ghost Archer Commander.'It was the only elite mob in the place. Despite that, during the process of developing consciousness, it suddenly stopped. That's why it was just a little bit smarter than a trash mob.Booo- Boo-The Ghost Archer Commander that was booing saw Hyun in the distance.At that moment\u2014!The consciousness of all the ghosts synchronized with the Commander\u2019s.Tens of Ghost Archers turned around and looked at Hyun.Boooo- Boo- Booooooooo-The cries of the ghosts resonated together and echoed through the fortress.The ghosts moved in unison and began aiming their arrows toward Hyun.Even he was intimidated by the sight of a ghost army aiming their bows and arrows at him in unison.\"It creeps me out a little bit...\"He felt like needles were pricking his pores.He was feeling something like a thirst for blood.But Hyun wasn't the type of person who would let himself be intimidated by such things.He mustn't be intimidated by stuff like that.Hyun thought he should try to get used to how things felt in virtual reality.Thuck-!Tens of arrows flew at the same time in his direction.The \u00abAll-Out Attack\u00bb skill of the Ghost Archer Commander had activated.He felt like a prisoner about to be executed.When countless arrows were about to hit him, Hyun activated one skill.\u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb!Clang Clang Clang Clang-!The sound of metal spread through the room.It was a sound made by the countless arrows loosed in unison by the Ghost Archers.Tens of arrows had tried to pierce him simultaneously in just one second.All of the arrows had tried to pierce him in that short frame of time.Oof- Hyun sighed.The activation of the skill could be neither slow nor fast.The situation was different from when he was defending himself from just one arrow. Arrows were flying from all directions. Some were far away, and others were close.He had to be careful with the timing of the skill if he wanted to be protected from the first arrow to the last one that flew toward him.Boooooooo-The hand of the Ghost Archer Commander moved up and down\u2014it was the signal ordering an \u00abAll-Out Attack\u00bb.Clang Clang Clang Clang-!The number of arrows flying had increased.That's because a few more ghosts were attracted to the place.But it didn't matter.The flight duration of the arrows shot by the Ghost Archers was less than one second.If he didn't mess up the timing, he could even block tens of thousands of arrows.The same scenario repeated all over again.All Ghost Archers attacked at the same time.Hyun used \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb.'I still need more.'Hyun didn't remain in the same place.While trying to lure Ghost Archers, he also attracted other ghosts.Soon, he was being attacked with hundreds of arrows simultaneously.An average player would have already lost.Even the best tanker, the 'Guardian Knight,' would have trouble with so many arrows if they had no special skill.It was ironic that a level 2 Support was able to survive a rain of arrows.\"This is actually an OP skill!\"He had to reevaluate the Support job since it could survive a massive arrow attack thanks to the \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb skill.In certain situations, the Support's advantage could be better than what he initially thought.Boo- Booooo-New ghosts kept appearing constantly.It was as if he was in the middle of a concert catered for ghosts.The number of arrows coming at him increased accordingly.Hyun had to defend himself from hundreds of arrows.Woooooooooo-.Suddenly, the sound of their cries changed.The body of the 'Ghost Archer Commander' changed from black to red. Hyun already knew what that meant.\"Next phase, huh?\"The Ghost Archer Commander, who had gotten angrier, ordered a new attack.\u00abMultiple All-Out Attack\u00bb.This attack pattern began when the Ghost Archer Commander got angry.The attacks from that point onwards would, as the name says, come in groups. Instead of one arrow, they'd shoot five arrows one after the other. And to worsen things, they'd do it all simultaneously!He couldn't block the\u00a0 \u00abMultiple All-Out Attack\u00bb with his \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb because it lasted for more than one second.But Hyun already knew everything about the Ghost Archers, so he already had a defense strategy that would work against them.\u00ab1 Second Immortality\u00bb, \u00abShield\u00bb!'As arrows flew toward him, he activated both skills simultaneously.\u00abShield\u00bbHe summoned a shield around him that lasted for one second.All monsters that had attacked the shield were stunned for 3 seconds.It was easy to explain what the skill did, but using it correctly was another story.Thuck Thuck Thuck-.As a rain of arrows flew toward him, the Ghosts lost consciousness.Thanks to Hyun being attacked, his \u00abShield\u00bb skill had activated. And thanks to it, the \u00abMultiple All-Out Attack\u00bb had been canceled.Watching stars go around on top of the heads of hundreds of ghosts wasn't something you could see every other day.\"Hehe, this is what I call a customized strategy.\"The damage was canceled with \u00abOne Second Immortality>; The \u00abMultiple All-Out Attack\u00bb was canceled with \u00abShield\u00bb.Everyone could do the same if they had those two skills, but coming up with such a strategy was something on another level.But Hyun's strategy didn't end there.[The cooldown time of \u00abShield\u00bb has been reset!]Every time the \u00abShield\u00bb was hit with an attack, the cooldown went down by five seconds. If he had received 120 attacks, that would mean that the cooldown time would go down by about 600 seconds.The moment the number of ghosts surpassed 120, he could use it without restrictions.Woo- Wooooo-.The ghosts had recovered consciousness, and they were preparing for their next wave of attacks.They placed their arrows on their bows and\u2014at the order of the 'Ghost Archer Commander'\u2014 launched their attacks.Riinnngggg!After making a refreshing sound, they all lost consciousness again.You could see stars going around on top of everyone's head.At the same time, the cooldown for \u00abShield\u00bb went to 0 again.Hyun and the ghosts kept doing the same thing for a while.If someone saw hundreds of arrows flying towards one point, and then every one of the attackers became red after being stunned, they would think they were watching a synchronized show.\"Should I end this?\"After a while, Hyun was starting to get tired.He got the theory right, but if he kept repeating the same thing, sooner or later, he would probably end up making a mistake.He had already gotten hit a lot, so the amount of experience he could obtain for contribution was probably the maximum amount he could get.It was time to get the fruit of his hard work.Hyun kept using \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb and \u00abShield\u00bb to guide the Ghosts that were in the fortress.As he got closer to the walls of Kantas Castle, the guards started to panic.\"Hey, what's going on?\"\"We have problems! An army of ghosts is approaching us!\"\"Is this the ambush of an enemy?! Where are they?!\"The soldiers of the Magic Country were getting nervous and causing a ruckus, but as the ones who were in charge of the security of a castle that was in the middle of a dangerous area, they calmed down quickly.They extended their wands towards the ghosts that were approaching them.\"Why are these guys bothering us again?! Prepare your best attacks! Everyone, get into position!\"At the orders of the Squad Leader, Chris, you could see lamps being turned on everywhere.They weren\u2019t really lamps. It was a light type spell called 'Erase.'Next, you could see many spells being casted at the same time from the walls by the soldiers of the Magic Country.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - First Teammate (1)Asrian Online's official page.Hyun, who had logged out to eat ramen, was looking at the ranking list.As he clicked on either local, country-wide, or global rankings, he could see the ids of current top players.The list was hard to read because there were languages from all over the world. But thanks to the auto-translate option, it became easier to read.<Global Ranking>1. Lattice - Lv.132. II - Lv.103. Strongest Berserker - Lv.104. Shao Shao - Lv.105. Cleo - Lv.106. Viper - Lv.97. Nihonjin desu - Lv.98. Mayday - Lv.99. Blank - Lv.9...Are numbers 3 and 7 Korean?If that username was written in real Japanese, it would probably say something like 'I'm Japanese.'\u2018That guy is definitely Korean.\u2019SeoHyun took a glimpse at the top 50 players.\"There isn't anyone remarkable yet.\"It was understandable that there wasn't someone he should be careful about yet. After all, Asrian Online had been open for one day.Once a week passes, most of the names there would probably change.The only player he should probably follow closely was the one using the ID 'Lattice.'There were many levels of difference between him and the other users.But the interesting stuff ended there.\"Still, he's not that great.\"After hunting ghosts, Hyun's level had reached 27. That meant he had more than 13 levels of advantage over the current number 1 player.Despite that, he didn't appear on the rankings. The reason was that he hadn't registered his character in the Hall of Fame.Users that registered on the Hall of Fame, depending on their rankings, gained fame.But it wasn't that they became celebrities. It was an important part of the game. Your fame was reflected on the NPCs. That meant you received more quests, met important characters, and obtained useful qualifications, among other helpful things. Your fame influenced the in-game experience.\"I'm probably better off not registering on the rankings yet.\"The reason why he wasn't interested in the Hall of Fame was simple.\u2014Information leak.The moment he registered in the Hall of Fame, everyone would get to know his ID and level.It wasn't like private information like stats, skills, and jobs were leaked, but the ranker tag would probably place a lot of eyes on him, and that would end up limiting his actions.\u2018Maybe I could even get some stalkers\u2026\u2019He didn't want to attract unnecessary eyes to him.'There are also some quests you can only do if you have low fame.'Some secretive quests required you to have low fame.If he registered in the Hall of Fame, quests like that would become forever out of his reach.He had considered many factors before deciding not to register his ID.'Even if I increase my fame, later on, it won't be late.'* * *Hyun (Lv.27)Job: Support[Strength: 2] [Agility: 2] [Vitality: 5] [Magical Power: 11] [Empathy: 27]Skills - <+Open List>[\u203b You have 52 unused experience points!][\u203b You have 26 unused skill points!]After logging in to the game, he looked at his status window.It was to understand the Support job better.\"Empathy is definitely the main stat.\"The Warrior focused on Strength and Health, Magicians and Priests focused on Magical Power, and the Thief focused on Agility.Focusing on those stats made it easier to develop each class's potential.But for a Support, it was hard to tell which stats were important.Next to most of the Support's skills, you could see an Empathy requirement.Should he focus on increasing Empathy? The answer to this question was harder than it seemed.\"It's hard to decide since this is a new class, and there's no information about it...\"The skills were even more complicated.Skill Points had two use cases: one was to make current skills stronger, and the other one was to unlock new ones.[ \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb (Lv.0 -> Lv.1) ]- You can increase all defensive stats by 3 extra points.(Skill Points required 1)[ \u00abShield\u00bb (Lv.0 -> Lv.1) ]- The opponents that lose consciousness receive 20% of your Empathy as extra damage.(Skill Points required 1)'Should I increase this or not...?'He was confused.The amount of defense given by \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb didn't increase much after leveling up. Not only that, but the duration time remained the same.Would the duration time increase if he leveled up the skill even further?The only way to discover the answer to that question was by trial and error. But there was one problem with that\u2026 He couldn't re-assign skill points. So if he made a mistake, that character would become useless.'Should I just learn a new skill?'After reaching level 20, he hadn't reviewed the new available skills.The skills listed below were some of the ones he had seen before.[ \u00abAddictive Counter\u00bb ]- Decrease the attack speed of an ally by 20%.- If a counterattack activates while fighting an enemy, they receive 200% more damage.(Points required: 5)[ \u00abSophisticated Weapon Mastery\u00bb ]- Increase the attack range of an ally by 10 cm.- While attacking an opponent, if the target is within the increased attack range, the damage they receive increases by 1.5 times.(Points required: 3)[ \u00abSophisticated Magic\u00bb ]- Increase the magical attack range of an ally by 1 meter.- While attacking an opponent, if the target is within the increased attack range, the damage they receive increases by 1.5 times.(Points required: 4)[ \u00abWeapon Enhance\u00bb ]- Increase the damage dealt by an ally by 50 points.(Points required: 10)He looked at the skills with doubtful eyes.'Are these good or bad skills?'Hyun tried to use his eight years of Asra Online experience to try and see how these skills synergized with others.The \u00abWeapon Enhance\u00bb skill seemed to be the most useful since it was intuitive and easy to understand.The other skills seemed to be useful under certain circumstances.\"Depending on how I use them, they could become cheat skills.\"Hyun was finally starting to understand the 'Support' job.It didn't have a direct attack skill.More than attacking himself, the role of the Support was more like a playmaker.Under certain circumstances, the synergy that the skills could have was amazing.Skills like \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb and \u00abShield\u00bb, which seemed useless at first glance, had proven useful if played correctly.The rest of the skills were the same.The pre-requisites of activating the Support's skills were quite difficult. But if you managed to satisfy them, you would be able to see their true potential.\u2014High risk and high return.It was a class that required a lot of skill and dexterity.The most important thing was creating the correct situations to make the class shine.\"The problem is that the Support has very clear limits.\"The Support wasn't a job that allowed solo playing as Hyun had wanted.Since its conception, a Support couldn't achieve greatness alone.\"I can't keep using strategies that rely on NPCs.\"Hyun felt the need to change his playing style.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *He had many fond memories related to Asra Online.There was a user with the ID 'Smiling Angel.'According to her profile, she was a 20-year-old girl. Her job was an evolved one from the Priest that was very similar to a Support.People from the guild often referred to her as 'Angel.'\u300cSmiling Angel, is there any new item you need?\u300d\u300cHey Angel, do you want to go together to the Dragon's Dungeon? I originally planned to do solo play, but I can carry you if you wish, lol.\u300d\u300cSmiling Angel, do you want to do a raid? We're in need of a priest. We don't care about things like specs, don't worry.\u300dThe moment she logged in, she was flooded with messages.She usually answered right away.\u300cFirst of all, I'll gladly receive the free item. Then, I will let you carry me through the dungeon and join the raid. So everyone, please wait for a little bit. ^^\u300dSmiling Angel.In Asra Online, she was something like a princess.She had at least five loyal underlings who would cry tears of joy just from her calling them by their names.Her royal highness sometimes rewarded her loyal underlings with a generous gift.\u300cDoes anyone need a buff? Oh, I'm low on mana. I'm only going to be able to buff three people. I'm sowy \u3160\u3160\u300dThe moment she spoke, tons of people who wanted to become her underlings suddenly appeared.Those incredibly moving scenes were recorded deep in Hyun's mind.What was even more surprising was that, later on, it was discovered that Smiling Angel was actually a 31-year-old man. But Hyun really didn't care about what had happened.Now, unintentionally, he had become a support.Smiling Angel. Maybe there was something he could learn from her(?).\"I need to get a damage dealer underling.\"Getting hard-working underlings seemed the best answer.If he added his supporting skills on top of that, maybe he'd be able to build a decent team.There was one problem with that: he wasn't sure if he had something like Smiling Angel, who could easily obtain the loyalty of several people.His ideal underling should have decent control and game sense.At the same time, it should be someone that listened and followed his orders.\"Is there anyone like that...?\"Hyun started to recall everything he could from Asra Online. Then, he remembered a certain face.\"There is someone!\"That guy would be perfect to have as an underling.SeoHyun immediately took action.He logged into Asra Online for the first time in a while.Most people had quit after the sequel came out. But that guy, who was also a top player, maybe was still around this place.\"There he is!\"Hyun shouted in happiness after checking out his friend list. He was also online.That person was one of the few users Hyun had on his friend list.Hyun was about to send him a whisper when he was surprised by a sudden message.['Ain' has challenged you to a 1 vs. 1 duel. Will you accept?]He wasn't expecting Ain to contact him first.It hadn't been 10 seconds since he logged in. Also, a duel request?Maybe\u2026 was he waiting for him to log in again?\"I guess I'll know the answer once I meet him.\"After accepting the request, he moved towards the duel room.In that place, a big wolf was waiting for him.It was a 'Werewolf', a part of the humanoid race.The ID 'Ain' was well suited for someone as wild as him.Thanks to Ain's cool personality, they got along well. That's why they frequently played together.Ain's playstyle was just like his personality, cool and cruel.Watching him scratch and rip apart an opponent was quite refreshing.He always looked like a wolf in the middle of a flock.Ain had very good control and a deep understanding of the game.In a 1 vs. 1 duel, using normal items, he wasn't sure he could beat him.The first time they met each other in the duel fiend, he had wondered if Ain wasn't a real pro gamer.\u300cLong time no see, Hyun!\u300d\u300cNot really, it's been only one week since the last time I logged in.\u300d\u300cIf you're not here, I don't have anyone else with whom I can have a duel. The only ones that are still around this place are the weaklings.\u300dJust like he always did, Ain approached him first.In Asra Online, there wasn't a voice recognition module, so to talk, Hyun had to type on the keyboard in the capsule.\u300cSince you're here, let's have a duel.\u300d\u300cI don't want to.\u300d\u300cWhy, are you afraid? You're finally admitting that you can't beat me, right?\u300dAnd just like always, he started talking about PVP.Ain was one of those players who enjoyed PVP more than hunting.\u300cI guess it's understandable. If our specs were similar, my win ratio would be higher!\u300d\u300cWe'll never know that without trying it first.\u300dHyun answered like that. But what Ain said wasn't something unrealistic.In Asra Online, Ain was the only user that could fight him on equal terms.Both were good at controlling their respective characters, but he had the advantage in terms of specs.Despite that, their win ratio against each other was similar. The reason behind this was that Ain was very good at mind games.Even Hyun couldn't match Ain's ability for getting to know the opponent's intentions.It'd been a week since they last talked to each other, so they took this opportunity to get an update on the other person.There wasn't any deep or special content in what they talked about. It was the usual chit-chat.It was Ain who suddenly changed the topic of the conversation.\u300cSo are you planning to quit Asra?\u300d\u300cI'm not sure... But I won't be login in regularly as I did before.\u300d\u300cReally? Well, I guess everyone eventually gets tired of a game. Even Asra.\u300d\u300cAre you going to keep playing Asra?\u300d\u300cI'm not sure. But if you quit, I'm also going to leave eventually.\u300dAin's words were printed out as a text, but Hyun knew he was sad about it.Hyun had known this guy inside the game for many years, so he could somewhat understand Ain's feelings.Ain wanted to retain Hyun, but his pride made it hard for him to say something like that.That meant this was the perfect opportunity to talk about the main topic.\u300cDon't you want to play Asrian with me?\u300d\u300cHmm...?\u300dAin remained silent for a while.It seemed like he knew that a sequel of Asra Online had come out.\u300cThat game has very high requirements, right? The capsule I have at home is quite old, so I'm not sure it will be able to run it.\u300d\u300cIs that so...?\u300d\u300cOh, wait. I'll just buy a new one.\u300d\u300cThen let's play together! After all, we're the strongest duo of Asra. Let's show everyone what we can do in Asrian Online.\u300dAin's doubt seemed to be deepening. Hyun was afraid of losing this opportunity, so he tried his best to lure him to Asrian.\u300cIf you create an ID, Hyung will help you level up. After all, my character is a support, so I have a lot of ways in which I can help you.\u300d\u300cYou? Hyung? Are you kidding me? But hey, you're a support? What happened that you'd chosen a job like that?\u300d\u300cStuff happened...\u300dHyun was smirking while typing using his two fingers.Ain had fallen into his trap. Convincing him would just be a matter of time.Hyun, as the master, and Ain, as his underling. He smiled just by thinking about the picture-perfect formation.To make Ain the perfect underling, he started to sweet talk.\u300cIf you're going to start Asrian Online, choose the Magician job.\u300d\u300cMagician? Why? I don't really like it.\u300dHe could easily tell that Ain didn't like the Magician job. After all, he was a werewolf that enjoyed close combat.Ain's current character was the definition of manliness.For someone like him, who enjoyed using macho-like characters and jobs, a Magician was probably just a weakling who launched attacks from a distance.'But still, it would be great if he could choose Magician as a job.'The job that had the best synergy with the Support was a Magician.Among the skills, there was one called \u00abWeapon Enhance\u00bb.This skill gave the target 50 extra damage.Since the Wizard's attack had a wide range, the effective damage dealt was lower than other jobs, but once you added \u00abWeapon Enhance\u00bb on top of it, the Magician's wide-range attack could become as dangerous as a nuclear bomb.In no way was he going to pass on such an explosive combination.That's why he talked as highly about the Magician job as possible.\u300cYou like jobs that require skills, right? In Asrian Online, the Magician is that type of character.\u300d\u300cReally...?\u300d\u300cYes! Casting a spell isn't automatic. You have to use your head. Hand signs need to be memorized, too, since you have to do it manually. What's clear is that it isn't an easy class to use.\u300dHyun told him things he had seen on the community boards.\u300cEven though it has a learning curve, a Magician can become one of the strongest if you learn to use it properly. It's OP at practically everything, including hunting, raids, PVP... Of course, it's hard to use it correctly. I'm not sure if you'll be able to do it.\u300d\u300cHmm... Now that you say it, Magician sounds interesting.\u300d\u300cSee?\u300dHyun became even more excited.If Ain selected Magician as a job, the picture became even more perfect.His skills were on par with professional gamers. But more than that, he was someone trustworthy.\u300cThere's something I've forgotten to tell you.\u300dHyun even explained to him how to get a hidden job while praying that Ain wouldn't make the same mistakes as him.\u300cWhen you're about to select a job, you'll meet an angel. If you call her by the name of 'Keidrial,' she'll become a demon. After that, you'll be able to see a previously hidden place. If that happens, you'll be able to choose top-tier or even hidden jobs. But there's something you need to remember. You shouldn't select the item she's trying to hide, no matter what happens. That isn't something she's trying to hide; it's an item that she's trying to lure you into selecting.\u300d\u300c???\u300dAin had trouble understanding what he had just said, so Hyun spent another thirty minutes trying to get him to understand everything regarding job selection.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 - First Teammate (2)The next day.SeoHyun was about to enter the capsule and log in when he saw that a user with the ID 'AIN' had sent him a message.\"Didn't he say that he had an older model? Don't tell me he already bought a new one...\"He really was someone that acted fast.SeoHyun was sending him a message when a chatting window opened.It seemed that Ain didn't know that the new capsule model had voice recognition.AIN: I created an ID in Asrian Online.LeeSeoHyun: Did you already buy a new capsule model?AIN: I did it at dawn. I have already finished the job selection process.\u2018What an amazing guy.\u2019\u2018How did he manage to buy a capsule at such an hour?\u2019But more than that, Hyun asked him about what he had insisted on yesterday.LeeSeoHyun: So, what's your job?AIN: Magician, just like you've said.LeeSeoHyun: Nice!It seemed like Ain had done a good job in completing the quest.LeeSeoHyun: Use teleport and come to the south gate of Kantas Castle.AIN: But I'm at level 1.LeeSeoHyun: Don't worry. I'll carry you.AIN: What's your level?LeeSeoHyun: 27.AIN: Can you hunt there at level 27?Ain, just like Hyun, was a top ranker at Asra Online. That's why he knew about the levels of the monsters around that area.The land of ghosts and the undead\u2026It wasn't a place for newbies under level 60.LeeSeoHyun: Just come. Once you get here, you'll understand everything.SeoHyun smiled. Even Ain, a former top-ranker, wouldn't be able to come up with a strategy like his.Gathering as many enemies as possible in order to farm a massive amount of experience\u2026He was probably going to be at a loss for words at the sight of more than ten levels going up all at once.In Asrian Online, unlike other games, you could check the facial expressions of other players.He was getting excited at the thought of seeing Ain astonished.* * *Kantas Castle, south gate.There were a lot of NPCs gathered in front of the walls.Two guards were protecting the gate; on the road next to it, you could see a group of girls selling flowers.In the distance, a group of merchants was returning after completing a trade.Hyun was looking everywhere while sighing.The reason was that he couldn't see the person he was looking for.\"Why is this guy so late?\"Hyun, who was tired of waiting, sent a message via the capsule.LeeSeoHyun: Where are you?Ring-Hyun received a reply immediately.AIN: I'm already here, at where you asked me to come.\u2018Huh?\u2019Hyun looked around, searching for Ain.'Just where...?'In Asrian Online, you couldn't tell the difference between NPCs and users just based on looks alone.Now that he thought about it, he had never seen Ain's real face.Ain: You're the guy standing next to the shop, looking around, right? You seem to be wearing silver clothes.Hyun was starting to get annoyed. He was indeed wearing a silver vest.That meant that Ain had already seen him. He was probably watching him from a distance.LeeSeoHyun: Don't joke with me and just come here!Aim: I'm currently looking at you. Come try to find me.\u2018He's looking at me?\u2019Hyun's eyes sparkled.He had seen a man looking at him from a distance.Yes, that must be him.'Huh? Why is he so handsome?'Ain seemed to be a blond guy whose height was more than six feet tall.His body was muscular. But more than a bodybuilder, he looked like a professional athlete.'That's Ain, right?'Just like his Asra Online persona, he looked like a macho-type person.\u2018So all this time, I've been playing with the typical popular guy.\u2019He really looked nothing like himself, who did nothing more than play video games all day.While feeling ashamed, he approached that man and initiated a conversation.\"Ain! I finally found you. You're quite handsome, huh?\"The moment Hyun talked to him, that man looked at Hyun with a confused look on his face. He answered Hyun with another question.\"Is there anything you need from me?\"\"Stop joking. I already know it's you.\"Hyun thought that Ain was joking around.\"I know that you've been looking at me for a while.\"\"I was watching you because you were looking around with a suspicious look on your face.\"The man, whom Hyun thought was Ain, took out something from his pocket.It was a badge that proved that he was the sheriff of the Magic Country.Ain: LOL, what are you doing over there?After receiving another message, he finally understood the situation.The man wasn't Ain. It was an NPC of the Magic Country.He was staring at him because he mistook him for a pickpocket.Ain: LOLWhile biting his lips and remembering the message, he asked the sheriff for forgiveness. After a long explanation, he finally made him understand that he wasn't someone suspicious.'Just where is this guy hiding?'When he was thinking that once he saw Ain, he was going to punch him, another message arrived.Ain: You still don't know where I am? I've been staring at you for a while.Hyun slowly moved his head and looked around. But he couldn't find anyone who matched his mental image of Ain.\u2018Just from where are you looking at me?\u2019The moment he had enough and was about to shout, just by coincidence, he looked towards the castle's gate.There was someone who was leaning on the wall. That person was laughing while looking at him.'No way...'It was someone with their arms crossed that had been looking at him for a while.'Wait. Really?!'The truth is that he already knew that someone was looking in his direction, but there was one reason why he had passed on that person.He would've never guessed that Ain was that person.'Is that really Ain?'The reason for his confusion was simple\u2014that person was too different from how he thought that Ain would be.Ain: Oh, it seems like you've finally found me.After sending the message, a petite girl approached him.She had black, bob-cut hair, her height was on the shorter side, and she barely reached Hyun's shoulders.The corners of her lips were slightly up.The girl he assumed was Ain was right in front of him.\"Hmm... This is the first time we\u2019ve seen each other's actual appearance, right?\"\"A... Are you really Ain?\"\u00a0 Hyun answered, stuttering.\"Haha, what's up with that strange way of talking?\"Hyun was flustered. All sorts of thoughts crossed his mind.Was it character customization?No... There wasn't an option that allowed you to change genders.Character customization required a lot of gold, so there was no way a new player like Ain could've tried it yet.That girl in front of him was indeed Ain. There was no other possible explanation.'How is it possible? That tough, manly werewolf Ain is actually a girl?'Hyun, whose head was filled with chaotic thoughts, suddenly started to ask her questions related to Asra Online.\"What's the name of the ultimate skill that the Werewolf Ain uses...?!\"\"Body Enhance... But why are you asking me that?\"Hyun asked her more questions, and she answered every single one of them.Ain seemed a little bit annoyed but still answered everything he asked. Most of the questions were things that no one else besides Ain would know.After a while, he finally could accept it.\"I've never imagined that you were actually a girl.\"\"Really? But I always knew you were a boy.\"Ain had a quiet voice that wasn't too different from the other girls of similar age.Since she was always cold and always went straight to the point, he always thought she was a guy.He asked her about it.\"Hyun, do you talk in real life just like you do on the internet?\"After being reproached, he wasn't able to form any words.But once time passed, his confusion dissipated.Hyun and Ain talked for a while.Once they began talking about Asra Online, the awkwardness disappeared.Back in Asra Online, Ain was one of the few people he used to talk to regularly.Once they talked, he found out something.Leaving the gender and appearance aside, Ain was still Ain.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *After they finished talking, Hyun started to focus again on his original goal.Ain: Damage Dealer.Hyun: Support.He had lured Ain to Asrian Online to make her his first slave.Now that he knew that Ain was, in fact, a young girl, the word 'slave' started to feel weird, but he decided to ignore it.He never mentioned that word in front of Ain, of course.Choosing the wrong words while talking to someone as prideful as her could bring a lot of problems.Hyun decided to start slowly.\"Your job is Magician, right?\"\"Yeah, you told me to pick it.\"\"Is it a promotion-type job or a hidden one?\"\"It's a hidden one, of course!\"Hearing the word \u201chidden\u201d made Hyun's heart sink. It made him remember the 'Support(Hidden)' nightmare.\"First, can you show me your status window?\"She nodded.Ain (Lv. 1)HP: 50/50Mana: 450/450Job: Close Range Magician (Hidden)[Strength: 15] [Agility: 15] [Vitality: 5] [Magical Power: 30(+15)]Skills - <+Open List>Titles - <+Open List>\"Hmm...\"First of all, it was indeed a Magician.But in front of 'Magician,' there were two strange words.He had never seen that job before, so that probably meant that it was a new one that wasn't in Asra Online.\u2018I'll think after checking out the skills.'[ \u00abFlame Claws\u00bb Lv.0]- Your claws get covered in flames, and you deal [Magical Power] x5 extra damage.- It consumes 10 mana per second.<Title>[Deceiver]- Magical Power 15- While trying to deceive an opponent, you're less likely to get caught.\"Hyun, show me yours too.\"\"Okay...\"While showing her his status window, Hyun started to think deeply about something.\u2018Close Range Magician\u2019.First of all, its overall stats were very high thanks to the job being a hidden one.He wasn't sure what Ain did while picking her job, but she had managed to get an extra title; thanks to that, her Magical Power was ridiculously high for a level 1 character.But there was the fact that Ain had only one skill, \u00abFlame Claws\u00bb.At first glance, it looks like an amazing one. After all, it dealt five times the Magical Power as damage.Even at level 1, it was capable of dealing a ridiculous amount of 225 damage.'The problem is that this skill has a fatal flaw.'\u00abFlame Claws\u00bb consumed a lot of Mana.The skill \u00abFire Arrow\u00bb consumed 10 mana. Using \u00abFlame Claws\u00bb was the equivalent of using one \u00abFire Arrow\u00bb per second. Basically, it leaked a lot of Mana!In Asrian Online, since there weren't many ways to recover Mana, it was a huge flaw.Not only did she not have an AOE attack, but there also wasn't a long-range attack.The job was a magician in name alone. In reality, it was more similar to a Warrior that fought using fists.Hyun wiped away the sweat.\u2018Why did it become like this?\u2019\u2018Did Ain also get ripped off by Keidrial?\u2019By seeing the title she had received, it didn't seem so.\"I think it's okay.\"\u201cNo... I think that we're screwed.\"\"I like it.\"Ain was smiling while watching her fingers covered in fire.Not only was Ain's hand burning; her Mana was burning too. The fire didn't even last one minute before it went out.She had consumed all of her Mana.\"Even if my hand is burning, I can't feel anything. I won't have to worry about burn marks.\"That was all Ain had to say about her job.\"Hyun, let's go hunting. I want to test this!\"She grabbed Hyun's collar with an excited voice.At the moment, all she could think about was testing her skill.Hyun got annoyed by that overexcited attitude of hers.\"This is a level 60 area! Test what?! How?!\"\"Then let's go to the next town. You have enough gold to teleport two people, right?\"Just like she'd said, he had some money he had earned by selling the clothes of the ghosts.\"F... For two...?\"\"Well, you were the one who told me to come to Kantas Castle, so you need to take responsibility,\"\u00a0 she said while making a mischievous smile.\"I started this game because you'd asked me to.\"Going hunting with her at that moment would be suicidal.The solution was doing the same thing they always did.\"I will let you test it on me in a duel.\"\"Duel...?!\"Just as he expected, Ain got excited at the word, \u201cduel\u201d.\"But Hyun, you're a Support. Can you win against me?\"\"What else can I do? Hit me as much as you wish.\"\"Then let's do it.\"After challenging Ain to a friendly duel, he finally calmed her down.Ain had always enjoyed dueling more than anything.The other day, when he logged in to Asra Online, she had sent a duel request almost immediately.Of course, there was no way he'd be able to beat her. He didn't have offensive skills, and his specs were lower than hers.The winner was already defined.'Hmm...? This seems to work great as a training session.'He lost, but as they dueled repeatedly, he was starting to get used to moving in virtual reality.Asrian Online was the first virtual reality game in which moving felt real, as if you were really using your muscles. It was different from other games where you had to use the controller to move.\"This is what it feels to toy you, huh?\"\"Oof... Let's duel a little bit more.\"\"Huh? Even if we did, you wouldn't be able to beat me.\"The duel junkie was Ain. But at that moment, Hyun was more eager than her to keep dueling.One hour after they began fighting, Hyun could imitate how he moved back in Asra Online.Both of them began to move with more precision. Ain began mixing fake movements with the attacks; that's why each duel didn't get longer.They were so concentrated on dueling that they didn't notice that three hours had passed and that they hadn't yet begun ghost hunting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 - Hidden Named Hunting Preparation (1)After Asrian Online came out, SeoHyun's schedule became full.First, he goes to the university for attendance check-in. Once he finishes that, he walks out of the campus.Thankfully, he hadn't signed on to any course that required group work.SeoHyun, who was hooked to Asrian Online, spent more time gaming than ever.His day really began once he came back home from school.He began his daily routine by checking the stock price of NFM.After Asrian Online came out, the stock price of NFM had reached new highs, and it was in the middle of a bullish trend.Most gaming-related sites were full of news related to NFM.NFM was originally by no means a small company.But in just three months, the stock price had risen 80 times. It was receiving the attention of the whole world, and it was in the process of re-writing the history of the entertainment industry.Asrian Online was a worldwide bestseller, and the stock was reaching new highs every day.Sadly, SeoHyun didn't know how to do stocks. He didn't have a single share of NFM, but seeing Asrian Online get bigger and bigger made him happy.\"Now, let's visit the next site.\"SeoHyun entered Asrian's community boards.Weirdly, there wasn't much information about the game on the official website.Did the developers want people to learn about the game slowly by actually playing the game?That was the reason why SeoHyun only entered the official website to read news about updates. The rest of the time, he always visited community sites.Most of the time, he laughed at the memes that people posted. But sometimes, he found useful information or news.<Title: How to level up fast! The fastest way to reach level 15!>There was a thread about a leveling-up strategy.Hyun wasn't interested in it since he had already surpassed level 15.He scrolled down to read the next post.<Title: How critical hits work>Another title caught SeoHyun's attention.It was a post by the user 'Medical Student Wannabe.'The first few lines were enough to draw his full attention.- How critical hits work in this game is easy: if you hit the opponent at a vital point, you'll be able to deal critical damage. One thing to remember is that you need to hit it with extreme precision.- I've discovered a total of 11 parts; among them are the head, the heart, the stomach, the arm, and the legs. Basically, they have the same weaknesses as us. If you hit the opponents in one of these parts, you'll be able to deal critical damage.It was a very useful thread, but it was sadly full of nonrelevant, dumb comments.- Girls have one less weakness compared to men. Isn't this too unbalanced?- If you're mad, just create a female character, lol.- Hey asshole, it isn't that easy to change the gender of your character. If you're not going to do it for me, just shut up.SeoHyun focused on the useful post rather than the useless commentaries.He didn't have enough time to care about keyboard battles.While reading the thread, he remembered the previous day\u2019s battle.'So this is how Ain manages to land critical hits all the time... This is different to how it used to work in Asra Online.'If you land an attack on a vital point, the opponent receives a critical hit.While dueling, Ain had aimed at his vital points with a smile on her face.While dueling, he had formed a suspicion that it was how critical hits worked, but the thread had just confirmed his theory.A battle system that resembles real life\u2026Something like that worked only because Asrian Online had sensory synchronization.\"I need to get used to the new system.\"After finishing reading the thread, he closed the tab.Once he did that, SeoHyun's daily routine was almost over.He had already checked out the stock price and read through the community boards.He had ramen for lunch and then took a cold water shower.He needed to do many things beforehand if he wanted to game for ten hours straight.After completing preparations worthy of a pro gamer, SeoHyun logged in to Asrian Online.[AIN has logged in.]He got a message that notified him that Ain had entered the game.She always entered Asrian Online between 17:00 ~ 18:00 and logged off at 03:00 am.In a way, Ain, who played Asrian Online every day until dawn, was a game addict.\u2026Although she didn't spend as many hours as him.Suddenly, he started to wonder something about Ain.Judging by her playtime hours, she seemed like a student.Her height and face made her look really young, and she seemed like a high school student at most.Not asking the age in video games was an unwritten rule, so he decided not to pursue it anymore.AIN: Are we ghost hunting today?Ain sent a private message as soon as she got into the capsule.Hyun and Ain stayed in Kantas Castle for four days in order to hunt ghosts.At first, because of the difference between the levels, she didn't get a lot of experience points.Up to a certain point, they just hunted together. But once their levels became similar, they formed a party; that allowed them to gain an equivalent amount of experience.Hyun Lv.42Ain Lv.40Thanks to that, both of them had surpassed level 40.He still remembered her face when he showed her the ghost farming method.\"Th... This is amazing... Even for you...\"Hyun smiled in high spirits.They had 20 levels of advantage over the top-ranker in the hall of fame, so there wasn't any user with a higher level than them.'But this much isn't enough. If the only advantage is the level, they'll eventually catch up to us.'Hyun knew better than anyone how to keep the distance between them.Even if the distance between top rankers shrank and became on par with each other, he'd be the exception.'I should start moving before it's too late.'Thanks to the online communities, he knew that the biggest guilds were busier than ever.There was only one reason for them to be busy: Named monster hunting!'I'm sure many guilds will soon try to hunt down named monsters.'He was confident that in two weeks, a lot of guilds would start a fierce competition among each other to hunt down named monsters.Everyone was after the accomplishment of the first named monster kill!The first kill always gave more rewards than the successive ones.Some named monsters increased your stats permanently, so everyone was probably after them.Some guilds would probably try to hunt named monsters to get free publicity.That's why it was the perfect time to do it.He was planning to move faster than the others.'I won't be able to kill every named monster that lives in the Asra Continent since it's so big.'The named monsters Hyun was after were the special ones! He was especially interested in the ones that increased your stats permanently.The accomplishment of killing a named monster for the first time would be given only one time, so he should move faster.'I should take Ain too, right?'The \u2018Close Range Magician's\u2019 specialty, \u00abFlame Claws\u00bb, could deal a ridiculous amount of damage in exchange for an absurd amount of Mana.It wasn't very useful for farming, but while hunting a named monster, the most important thing was to deal as much damage as possible in a short amount of time.There shouldn't be anyone better than Ain for that.'The only weakness is that she is fragile. But I, as a Support, can cover that.'First of all, he decided he should check out both of their stats and skills.\"How many stat points do you have left? You haven't used them yet, right?\" Hyun asked Ain.\"Uh... I have 70.\"\"70?\"Hyun rapidly did some math inside his head.Ain was at level 40. Every time you leveled up, you received two stat points... So she should have 78 left.Hyun thought that maybe he had made a mistake in the calculations.\u2018Why are there eight stats missing?\u2019What Ain said next solved Hyun's doubts regarding her stats.\"I've used eight to increase my strength.\"\"Strength...?\"\"Yes.\"\u2018Why would a magician need strength? Is there something I'm missing?\u2019This new doubt was also quickly answered by her.You could see cold sweat dripping from her forehead.\"I mistakenly thought that I was still a werewolf. You know... The fighting style is very similar to before, so I just used those stat points without thinking about it. I... It should be okay, right? Maybe having more strength could be good in the future.\"\"Hmm...\"\"Even if I made a mistake allocating some stats, I should be okay with my level of control. Right?\"After hearing Ain's excuse, he got a Deja Vu.How she tried to excuse herself reminded him of a certain somebody.It was like seeing that guy who had mistakenly chosen Support as a job.\u2018Trying to excuse oneself is a personality trait of the hidden job?\u2019 For a little while, he thought of something as ridiculous as that.\"Let's... Use the rest of the stats more carefully.\"\"Okay...\"In silence, Ain upgraded her stats.Ain (Lv. 40)HP: 200/200Mana: 1000/1000Job: Close Range Magician (Hidden)[Strength: 23] [Agility: 30] [Vitality: 5] [Magical Power: 85(+15)]<Skill List>[Flame Claws Lv.0]- Your claws get covered in flames, and you deal [Magical Power] x5 extra damage.- It consumes 10 mana per second.[\u203b You have 39 unused skill points!]Title - <+ Open List>Of course, the most useful stat for a \u2018Close Range Magician\u2019 was [Magical Power].Even if you didn't allocate any stats in vitality, your HP still goes up when you level up, but if you don't increase your Magical Power, your Mana won't increase.There was nothing too hard to think about since there was a minimum mana requirement next to most of the magician's skills.\u2026And a little bit of agility helped deliver the skills.Since Ain was a Close Range Magician, she also needed to take care of her combat skills.Her Magical Power and Agility needed to be balanced; only by doing that would her skills and stats be well balanced and show great synergy.'Her Vitality is on the lower side, but since I'm here, she should be okay, right?'There were some named monsters whose attacks couldn't be blocked, but he wasn't planning on hunting them.The ones he was after were the named monsters they could counter with their synergy.'Let's leave skills alone for the moment.'They still had a lot of unused skill points, but there was no need to hurry.Ain's flame attacks had already surpassed 500.That amount of damage was so much that he couldn't completely neutralize it with his \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb skill.Considering that she was level 40, that amount of damage was simply ridiculous.If you don't take into account the high amount of Mana that the \u00abFlame Claws\u00bb skill requires, the Close Range Magician was probably one of the hidden jobs that could deal the most DPS (Damage per Second).'The damage is more than enough.'According to his calculations, they could take out a level 50 named boss in under five minutes.From then on, the problem wouldn't be damage dealing, but all the other things.\u2026And he was probably going to be the one that needed to cover all the other things.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Arneng, Hell Dust.The two of them had been playing the game together from the start, so they were really close.The first time they had played together, it was by coincidence. By pure luck, they began hunting together; that's why they ended up entering the same guild.They quickly became good friends.The main reason behind their friendship was that gaming was the primary source of income for both of them.\"I think that things are stabilizing.\"\"Yes, that's true. Even though the server has been open for just over a month, we're earning enough money to survive.\"\"That clearly shows that there are a lot of people playing this game.\"Asrian had only one worldwide server.There were more than a hundred million players, and at any given time, millions of people were online.The world had never seen a game so polished and with such a big scale as that one, and the number of players was increasing day by day.Arneng smiled.\"This game is still growing, so our income will keep growing too.\"\"Yes, that's true,\" answered Hell Dust whilst also smiling.Arneng and Hell Dust were sure that they would be able to achieve financial success with Asrian Online.After all, they were already level 30.Considering their rankings, they were among the top 0.01% of players.Basically, they were in the heavenly realm.The only thing other users could do was look up at them.\"The number 10 in the ranking is at level 35, right? We'll probably be able to catch up soon. The difference between us isn't that big.\"\"If we level up at this pace, shouldn't we be able to become rankers?\"\"If we're lucky enough, we'll probably be able to become rankers.\"\"All top rankers earn a lot of money, right? Once that happens, I want to buy a building in LA.\"\"I just want to get a sports car.\"\"Once we become rankers together, let's meet up in real life. How does that sound?\"\"That sounds good... It's going to be a meeting between two members of high society.\"Rankers were people among the top 1000 players in the Hall of Fame.The top 1000 may sound easy to achieve, but the truth is that those people were among the top 0.001% of players\u2014they were the one in a million kind of players.Arneng and Hell Dust thought that they could get to that level.But their confidence was by no means vain.A few days ago, a guild member had discovered important information related to hidden named monsters. Everyone within the guild had gotten excited.Information about normal named monsters was already considered confidential information, but someone had just discovered something above that, a hidden named monster.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 - Hidden Named Hunting Preparation (2)The guild had canceled everything they'd planned for the day and had a meeting.They talked about how they'd discovered the hidden named enemy, if it was trustworthy information, how feasible it was them defeating it, etc.The conclusion was that there was a real possibility of them killing the hidden named monster, but it was hard to guarantee that the raid would be a success.Even if they failed in killing the boss, getting to know its weakness or patterns would be useful information for the future.With that goal in mind, they selected a group of 20 players.Arneng and Hell Dust were among the people that the guild had chosen.The main goal was information gathering, but if they concluded that they could hunt it down during the combat, they were allowed to do it.Arneng talked about the realistic probabilities of them hunting the named monster down.\"The place where the hidden named monster is said to appear is in the Dark Forest. Most monsters around that area are at level 20, so a hidden named one should be at level 25 or 30 at most.\"The group formed for the expedition was composed only of elite players.Among the 20 members, there wasn't a single player under level 25.The ratio of knights, thieves, priests, and magicians was also perfect.Every single one of them was an elite player that was really skillful.Even if it was a level 30 named boss, they didn't think it would be a one-sided fight.\"What do you think?\"\"About what?\"\"Us. We originally planned to gather information and then back off as soon as possible, but what if we could beat the boss?\"Haha- Hell Dust answered while laughing.\"Well, it's possible. With our skills, a level 30 named boss could be easier than we originally thought.\"\"What do you think, Tarr Tarr?\" Arneng asked the boy that was next to him.Tarr Tarr was also among the players selected by the guild.He was a new member of the guild. Since he was in 9th grade in real life, he was the youngest member.\"I think that Mr. Arneng may have a point.\"\"May have?! If you're a boy, you should talk with more self-confidence!\"\"R... Really? Haha...\"Arneng patted Tarr Tarr's back, who was laughing awkwardly. He felt happy but pressured since he thought he was the weakest among the guild members.'Everyone here except for me is amazing.'Tarr Tarr thought that it was by pure luck that we had passed the test to join the guild.At first, the fact that he was able to join a famous guild made him happy, but as time went on, he began worrying.'There are a lot of good players in the world.'That's what he thought while hunting with them.He was always amazed by the other guild members' gaming sense and skills.He didn't even dare to copy their movements.Every day he could see things he had only seen on YouTube and in crazy gameplay compilations.Arneng, Hell Dust, and all the other guild members were his role models.'I also have to do my best if I don't want to put others out.'He wasn't confident enough, but if he kept doing his best, he would probably get better as time went on. Tarr Tarr told himself that he needed to be more self-confident.\"Everyone, stop.\"While walking through the Dark Forest, the team leader suddenly raised his hand.\"It seems to be around here.\"They'd found a road that led to an empty plot of land. In the middle of it, there was a strange-looking temple.\"Is this the 'Blue Temple'? It really looks like where a named monster would appear,\" the leader of the raid nervously said.\"Doesn't it feel colder here?\"Everyone nodded at the question.The wind that reminded them of an autumn night had suddenly turned cold.\u2026A place covered by ice.That place, where you could even see frost in the grass, was the Temple of Frost.Everything they were seeing was exactly like the information they'd gotten from the guild.That meant that the possibility of them finding a hidden named monster there was really high.\"It was true.\"\"Is a hidden named monster really going to appear?\"\"I'm shaking with excitement. We're probably the first ones to engage with a hidden named monster. This also means we will be able to get to the top!\"\"Everyone, silence!\"After the leader, Guy's, order, everyone became silent.\"Don't talk as if we've already finished the raid. A hidden named monster probably has better skills than the average named monster; that means they're probably going to be stronger and more dangerous.\"He didn't forget to warn everybody once again.\"The moment we engage in combat with the hidden named monster, you have to follow my orders. If you die while moving by yourself, you won't be compensated accordingly. If you die, it's going to be your loss.\"\"I'll be careful.\"\"Either way, I'm not going to die.\"At Guy's order, everyone got closer to the temple.Nex they needed to discover how to call the hidden named monster.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The atmosphere was starting to get denser.Every particle of the air became sharp as a blade made of ice. All the ones present there could feel it.The cold fog started to swirl around the temple.Swosh- The cold fog started to form a vortex that constantly grew in size.An ice vortex so big that it seemed to connect land and sky appeared in front of the group.[The cold weather makes your movements slower!]They were so intimidated by the sight that they couldn't read the message in front of them.It was hard to remember that they were in the middle of a virtual reality game.ZOOM- Suddenly, ice pillars rose from the ground and locked them up.The ice pillars blocked the sun. It was as if it was saying that there was no way out once you were there.They felt like gladiators locked up in a stadium made of ice.\"The quality of the production is just amazing.\"\"It looks like a scene from a movie.\"A few of the members talked very calmly to hide their nervousness, but what they couldn't hide was the cold sweat dripping from behind their necks.\"Everyone, prepare yourselves! The named monster is about to appear!\"Guy shouted after seeing a white shadow that had appeared in the middle of the vortex.That was definitely the hidden named monster.They were trembling because of the pressure that characterized named monsters.He was also trembling.Guy bit his lips.If he, the strongest one of the group, was trembling, the other people were probably in a worse state than him.\"This is a named... He makes you tremble regardless of your will.\"It is clearly said on the page of Asrian Online.The game can control human emotions.It used your brain waves to make you feel fear or awe about something; researchers had concluded that the technology didn't have side effects.Getting your senses and emotions manipulated\u2026He had previously thought that the feature was nothing noteworthy. But at that moment, when he was in front of the named monster, he had changed his opinion.\"Did you come here in search of me?\"At that moment, they heard a voice as cold as the ice.Because of the echo, it was hard to grasp the direction from where the voice was coming.They looked around in surprise.\u2026But there was no need for that.The owner of the voice, just like a fog, had suddenly appeared in front of them.The ice vortex disappeared. Instead, you could see an old magician wearing a white robe standing there.Magical runes covered his body. The old magician was looking at them with ominous eyes.[The forgotten Magician 'Leopard' has appeared!]- Leopard was a very famous magician who was active in the war with the empire that happened 20 years ago. He used to say that he was a heavenly being. With the excuse of magical research, he has killed numerous people. His ways were so cruel that the royal family of Levia decided to sentence him to death.Leopard's robe became stiff because of the cold energy emanating from him.\"You commoners from earth can't defy me, a heavenly being. I'm going to make sure you're not able to step inside this place ever again.\"Along with his arrogant tone of voice, you could feel a very strong killing intent.All the members present there flinched.No one would've been able to guess what happened to them at that time.One of the special effects of 'Sensory Synchronization' was the ability to cast hypnosis over the user.It was able to force changes in what humans felt.The signal sent from the capsule mixed with the brain waves and created a sensation called fear.\"Ugh...!\"For a moment, they really feared for their lives. They'd completely forgotten that it was a game.\"W... What's happening?\"Arneng was having trouble speaking; that's because he was having difficulties breathing.He looked around. Everyone's reaction was the same.Hell Dust was trying to breathe with his eyes wide open.\u2026He was barely standing. He really wanted to kneel down.He didn't have time to think about how they were able to create such a terrifyingly realistic experience in virtual reality.But Arneng was soon freed from the fear.Leopard had ended his gaming session for the day.\"One down.\"The moment Leopard raised his wand\u2026!Arneng, who had become rigid, turned into light and disappeared.[You've lost more than 33% of your HP, so your body stopped working properly!][You've lost your heart!][Since an important part of your body vanished, you died immediately!][You'll be able to log in again in 48 hours.]With an influx of messages coming through one after the other, Arneng's consciousness returned to reality.Arneng's corpse disappeared.\"A-Arneng!\"'Arneng, a Warrior, was killed with just one shot?'Hell Dust was horrified.He couldn't believe that a level 30 Warrior had been killed so easily.Not only that, but even though Arneng was standing right next to him, he couldn't see what kind of magic he had been hit with.The only thing he could sense was that something had pierced through him.Leopard, who was standing far away in the distance, was smiling.\"This is just the beginning...\"Swish-Another thing flew through the air.It all happened in an instant.Even though it was the second time Leopard had used the skill, no one was able to see through it.The speed of his spell was so fast that it was hard to follow it with their eyes.When everyone else noticed what was happening, Hell Dust had been killed already.Even Hell Dust wasn't able to see how he was killed.[You've lost more than 33% of your HP, so your body stopped working properly!][Your neck has been cut off!][Since an important part of your body vanished, you died immediately!][You'll be able to log in again in 48 hours.]\"Everyone, run! We must learn what the ability of the hidden named is first!\"The leader, Guy, screamed while raising his fist.Arneng and Hell Dust had been defeated in just an instant, even though they were among the five strongest members of the group.The fact that they didn't know anything about the attack showed the severity of the situation.'It's too dangerous.'Guy could feel the difference in power between them and the named monster.This wasn't the moment to strategize a plan.If they weren't careful, they would be wiped out!\"Another attack is coming! Everyone, please concentrate! Remember, our goal is to get as much information about this named monster as possible!\"Their main objective had shifted from clearing the quest to trying to return alive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 - Hidden Named Hunting Preparation (3)\"Do you think that you'll be able to evade my attacks?\"Leopard, who was moving his wand, suddenly opened the palms of his hands.Whack- An air-cutting sound could be heard.At the same time, one of the users that was walking backwards twitched and convulsed.[You've lost more than 33% of your HP, so your body stopped working properly!][You've lost both of your legs, so you won't be able to move!][You're not going to recover your legs unless you get treated at a shrine or die!]Another person was hit.That time, it was his legs.He could avoid being killed since the attack didn't hit a vital point, but it was hard to feel relieved.The user who had lost both legs rolled around on the ground while screaming in pain.\"Hahaha! You became a roly-poly toy!\"He couldn't hear Leopard's laughter.The user that had just been attacked was screaming because of the damage received.The truth was that the pain inflicted by virtual reality didn't hurt that much.If you could feel real pain inside a game, no one would dare to play it.Even if your legs and arms were cut off, the pain you felt hurt as if you'd hit yourself with a doorknob.But the placebo effect was scarier than most people thought.In a game that looked just like real life, your emotions were controlled via your brain waves.While in the middle of a dangerous situation, you just don\u2019t have time to consider if the intensity of the pain you're feeling is real or not.Most people had never experienced the pain of having their extremities cut off, so that made the confusion worse.\"Ouch...! Log out! Log out!\"[If you log out in the middle of a battle, you won't be able to log in for 48 hours!][Do you really want to log out?]He subconsciously decided to escape to real life.He was only able to calm down after the brainwave protection system of the capsule kicked in.But the rest of the group had to keep fighting with Leopard.'What should I do...?'Guy was starting to feel the pressure.Three people had died, but they still couldn't understand the nature of the opponent's attack.If things went on like that, everyone would die. Not only that, but because of the named monster's special effect, they were having a hard time breathing and couldn't think properly.\"So you're the leader, huh?\"At that moment, Leopard began targeting Guy.He had discovered that Guy was the one leading the party, so he wanted to get rid of him first.Whoosh-In front of Leopard's wand, a magic circle appeared.The spell that had killed Arneng and Hell Dust was targeting Guy.Bang-The moment Guy heard the vibrations of the wind, his eyes opened wide.With all the strength he had left, he tried to move his shoulders.With a little bit of pain, he could feel his arm being detached from his body.[You've lost more than 33% of your vitality, so your body stopped working properly!][You've lost your left arm!][You're not going to recover your arm unless you get treated at a shrine or die!]He heard a rock behind him break.Guy turned around.That's when he finally learned what the magic that couldn't be seen was.\"Ice...?\"A very sharp piece of ice was stuck in the middle of a rock.The ice was so smooth and transparent that it looked like a diamond.The ice could pierce through everything because Leopard had applied a magic that made the ice rotate faster, thus increasing the damage output.\"You're lucky my \u00abIce Top\u00bb missed you. It should've pierced your heart, but you won't get lucky twice.\"Leopard, the magician, moved arrogantly and once again pointed at Guy with his wand.The magic circle in front of his wand began spinning.Up until then, he had used only one type of magic.\u00abIce Top\u00bb.That was the identity of the spell that was so fast that it was impossible to see.Every time someone was hit with the ice, you could hear screams.Arneng, Hell Dust, and another guild member couldn't avoid death.The leader, Guy, had managed to live, but he had lost his left arm, so he wasn't able to engage in battle.Guy was starting to feel frustrated.They were all being killed with a single shot; they would all be wiped out if things went on like that.'There's no way this named monster is level 30...! He's probably level 60! There's also a chance he's over level 70!'Guy tried to guess as much information about the named monster as possible.Even if he was in a low-level area, his level was really high.Did he say that the name was quick...? It definitely suits it.That magic wasn't something you could see and evade\u2014it was too fast for that.Smash, Smash! You could hear something breaking, followed by the scream of someone.That time, two guild members standing in the attack's trajectory died with just one hit.Whoosh-Was there no end to Leopard's mana pool?After forcing many players to log out, he kept waving his wand and rotating the magic circle.There was no way out of it.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\"Everyone, attack! Even if you die, do it while attacking!\"As soon as Guy gave an order, everyone launched an attack directed toward Leopard.The Magicians attacked him with flames, and those who didn't know how to use magic used their bow and arrows.Flames and arrows poured over Leopard.The Warriors raised their swords and charged towards him.Leopard laughed at the attacks that were coming his way.\"What a bunch of losers.\"\u00abSnow Shield\u00bb.Stomp-! Leopard's wand hit the floor, and thus his second magic activated.Thousands of ice pellets began rotating with him at the center\u2014it was truly a shield made of snow.Thuck-The arrows disintegrated when they hit the ice pallets and scattered away.All the Warriors froze. After a few seconds, they were covered in a light, and then they faded away.Wh... What kind of magic...?\"Guy was shocked after seeing Leopard's new skill.The guild's firepower became useless instantly as the four Warriors faded away.His mouth was agape in awe. The difference between them was too big.\"You will all die.\"Whoosh-.Leopard extended his wand, and the magic circle in front of it started to spin.Bang! There was the sound of air being torn away.The \u00abIce Top\u00bb pierced him while making a loud noise that reminded him of a bullet.\"Ugh-!\"A short scream came out of Guy's mouth; the sound hit the ice walls and echoed through the space.Only after seeing the massive influx of messages did he become conscious of what was about to happen to him.[You've lost more than 33% of your HP, so your body stopped working properly!][The attack has pierced your head, so you died instantly!][You'll be able to log in again in 48 hours.]Even Guy became light and faded away.\"Even the leader was defeated...\"\"This plan was a complete failure... He's just too strong, to begin with...! How are we even supposed to defeat him?!\"\"I don't think we'll be able to kill him until we reach level 100.\"What that person said was very close to reality. After all, Leopard's level was 95!Considering that hidden named bosses were stronger than the average monster, they were most likely to fail even if 20 level 100 players attacked Leopard.From the beginning, he wasn't someone that level 20~30 newbies could fight and win.Once Guy, the leader, was defeated, it didn't take long for the rest of them to be annihilated.Leopard breathed a chill cold enough to freeze the eyebrows and completely destroyed the remaining users.\u00abIce Top\u00bb.\u2026An ice bullet so fast that it was almost impossible to see it.Every time Leopard pointed to someone, a hole appeared on the target's body.Sometimes, Leopard, who was covered with a blizzard, jumped right into the middle of the party.The moment people even touched it, thousands of rotating ice shards would pierce them.In the middle of the storm, light rays went up into the sky.And finally\u2026Leopard's ice blue temple returned to normal.After a while, all the corpses of the guild members disappeared.If it wasn't for the trace of the fight, it seemed like nothing had happened there.'What should I do?'It wasn't like everyone from the team sent there had died.The youngest member of the guild, Tarr Tarr, was still alive. He was hiding behind the rock, holding his breath.He covered his mouth with his hands to avoid breath from leaking out.'Has everyone else died?'It was his first time experiencing something like that.The moment the named boss started leaking a very strong killing intent, he became scared and escaped alone.It wasn't that he did it on purpose.If a third party saw what he did, they'd call him a coward.After all, everyone but himself had died.As time went on, Tarr Tarr began worrying.What if there was someone that saw him escaping?If he returned alive alone, there might be some people who would point their fingers at him and call him an egoist.If he got put on a blacklist, no other guild would accept him as a member. Maybe he should have died together with the rest of the members.Tarr Tarr made up his mind.The boss was still there, so dying shouldn't be hard.If he also died there, he would be able to say that he also had been killed while fighting.Tarr Tarr had decided to die at the hands of the named boss.Right at that moment\u2026'Who's that...?'Tarr Tarr had gotten up to commit suicide when he saw two people.He hid again.He saw two people wearing black robes entering the 'Blue Temple.'\u2018Are they human?\u2019Since they were wearing hooded robes, he couldn't see their faces.The only thing he could see was their body type.One was just as small as he was; the other person was a little big bigger than him.'Did they get here by mistake? No, that can't be. In the first place, to come here, they should be skillful. After all, the monsters around here are strong.'But they weren't carrying any weapons. Not only that, the only protective gear they were wearing was the black robe.The first impression he had of them was that they looked like people that were wandering around.You\u2019d get flustered when walking around the Dark Forest and entering the Blue Temple. The temperature difference is very notable.But those people not only were not flustered, but they also seemed very calm. It was as if they knew everything they needed to know about the place.'That can't be, right?'For a moment, Tarr Tarr thought about something ridiculous.Once again, he tried to think rationally.Those people were probably hunting in an area near there, and they'd just discovered by pure luck the place where the named boss was.\u2018No, they're going to die soon. So they're unlucky.\u2019After all, it was the home of the hidden named monster, Leopard.Tarr Tarr, who had seen Leopard fighting, was sure about something. At the moment, there wasn't a player with a level high enough to beat Leopard.Those two are not going to be the exception.'I'll need to push back the suicide mission for a little while.'Tarr Tarr decided to remain hidden. After all, it probably wouldn't take a lot of time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 - The Spirit that Wanted to Become a Heavenly Being (1)\"There he is.\"Ain pointed to something white that could be seen in the distance.That thing that looked like a human being was the hidden monster named Leopard.On the floor under his feet, traces of a previous battle could be seen.Hyun tilted his head.\"Why is the boss outside? Did someone else try to get him and fail?\"\"That seems to be the case.\"\"I don't know who they are, but how foolish. It's been only one month since the game came out. Who in their right mind would try to catch Leopard so soon?\"Hyun shook his head.\"Well, it really doesn't matter as long as we get the first kill achievement. Let's just hope he isn't a regen-type monster.\"Hyun never thought that someone else would try to kill Leopard so soon.A level 95 named monster wasn\u2019t an opponent that could be defeated by a group of users around level 30.Within the user base of that time, there shouldn't be anyone who'd be able to counter Leopard's skill, \u00abSnow Shield\u00bb.That skill surrounded the monster with thousands of rotating pieces of ice.The ice not only protected Leopard, but each rotating piece of ice could deal damage, so even getting close to him was hard.In the stage of the game they were in, Leopard should be the worst nightmare for players.Of course, that was from the point of view of players with normal jobs, but there's always an exception.\"Even if it's a hidden named monster, to us, it\u2019s nothing more than experience and items,\" Hyun said while making a grim smile.\"Are we really going to be okay? It's a level 95 boss...\"\"Huh? You don't trust me?\"\"Hmm... In regards to hunting named monsters, you're quite trustworthy.\"Ain nodded.Ain was better than Hyun in psychological warfare, but Hyun was better than her in everything else. It was hard to catch up to him in certain aspects, no matter how much she tried. It had been a long time since she had started admiring him.Hyun's abilities that made her admire him were also shining there in Asrian.Both of them had managed to kill 17 hidden named monsters.Hyun knew the attack pattern of every boss; that's why he was able to use creative strategies to counter them. Sometimes he used mean strategies, but either way, every single plan of his ended up in success.Even for a fellow former Asra Online ranker, the things he could pull off were impressive and praise-worthy.'If Hyun says that it's possible, we should at least try it.'Ain began warming up while looking up-front.Leopard had noticed them and was coming to where they were standing.\"There were some small fry left? You're just simple human beings anyway.\"Leopard mumbled while pointing them with his wand.\"I'll also send you to the other world.\"\u00abIce Top\u00bb.Not long before, no one had been able to avoid his attacks. Even a small touch had been enough to kill them.Leopard was sure that it would be the same with those two.Annoyed, he moved his hand and launched his attack. He was about to turn around because he thought he had killed the insignificant bugs.\"What...?\"Since a fearless little girl was coming at him, he launched an attack without thinking twice.At first, he thought a single attack would be enough to break her neck, but he was forced to turn around.Even after launching his attack, the opponent was still standing there as if nothing had happened.Leopard frowned.Since he had turned around after attacking, he hadn't seen what had happened.Was it a coincidence?Did he make a mistake while calculating the trajectory of the magic?Once again, he pointed at her and launched another attack. This time, he would definitely put an end to her.The ice made a sharp noise and flew towards her.And then\u2026\"What...!\"That time, he saw it clearly.\u2014Why his magic hadn't touched her.The moment the \u00abIce Top\u00bb was about to pierce her chest, she had brushed it off with the palm of her hands.The flight trajectory of the magic had changed.Leopard was in shock after seeing such an amazing stunt.\"How did she do it...?\"During his lifetime as a magician of the Magic Country and after becoming a spirit, Leopard had fought many enemies. Among them, some people had been able to defend themselves against his attacks.Most either did it with a shield or defensive magic; some people with extremely good sight were able to do it with their swords, but it was his first time seeing someone using their hands to brush away a magic attack.Leopard was frustrated after seeing such a feat that went against common sense.After seeing such an unusual thing, Leopard was lost in words.How was she able to brush off an attack that could pierce steel with such little hands?But unlike what Leopard was thinking, Ain wasn't having an easy time.Brushing off an attack with the hands may have seemed easy, but it really wasn\u2019t. There were a lot of complex strategies involved.She couldn't make a single mistake.One mistake meant death.Ain kept remembering everything Hyun had just explained to her.\"The main attack of the boss is called \u00abIce Top\u00bb.\"\"It's a simple attack that consists of shooting a piece of ice, but it's extremely fast\u2014even you're going to have a hard time avoiding it.\"\"The damage output is more than 10,000, so if it touches you, you're dead.\"\"My \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb gives you 50 extra defensive stats, so it can't block 10,000 damage.\"The first time she\u2019d heard Hyun's explanation, she thought it'd be impossible to pull it off.\u2026A magic so fast it was impossible to avoid it.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The damage output was too high to block it with the \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb defensive skill.Under those conditions, anyone else would have given up, but Hyun ended up finding an answer.\"When the magic comes flying in your direction, brush it off and forcefully change its path. Normally, you'd lose your arms if you tried something like this...\"\"But if I reinforce your defensive stats with \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb during that short period, the situation changes!\"That was what Hyun had thought.Normally, even if you managed to do that, you'd still lose your hands because of how high the damage was.In Asrian Online, there was a system that if you received more than 33% of damage at once, you wouldn't be able to use the part of the body that received the attack.But what if the defense against magic increased by 50?In Asra and Asrian online, there was a bonus for being precise.Just like you got critical hit damage by attacking the opponent at a vital point, by brushing off the opponent's attack, depending on the angle, the damage received decreased.If you could decrease the damage output to a certain point, you could perfectly block any attack with \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb.The problem was that this was all in theory.\"The magic will come flying in your direction when the wand shines.\"\"There's a margin of 0.2 to 0.3 seconds. But if it's you, you should be able to react.\"Whoosh-Leopard's wand illuminated.Ain made sure to keep her eyes wide open.Her body moved faster than she thought was possible.The moment she twisted her waist, she was able to brush off the incoming attack with her hands.Just before her hands touched the ice, Hyun applied his \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb on her.Smash- The piece of ice missed Ain and hit a tree behind her.The damage Ain received by pulling that off was zero: She hadn't received any damage.Oof- Ain sighed in relief.\u300cDo you think you'll be able to do it?\u300dHyun asked Ain.Yes, of course. Although my hands are tingling a little bit.\u300d\u300cOkay, then let's do it.\u300dThey were talking via whisper, which was something reserved for friends.They had chosen to talk that way because they were in the middle of a battle, and there was a risk of not being able to hear what the other person was saying.In order to dissipate the opponent's attack, Hyun rushed towards the back of the boss monster.Whish- The wand illuminated again. And once more, Ain was able to brush it off.Hyun had been able to synchronize his \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb with the exact moment Ain dismissed the ice bullet.The time necessary to recast 'Ice Top' was longer than the one of \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb, which was 10 seconds. Hyun had already made all the necessary calculations and was ready to use his skill at any moment.Hyun had managed to cast the buffs at the exact time.The two moved in perfect synchrony as if they were only one person.If one person made a mistake, they'd both die. You could say that their harmonious way of fighting was beautiful.The boss kept attacking them.The direction in which the wand was pointed changed.Hyun's eyes widened.That time, he was the target!His reaction timing wasn't that much worse than Ain's.He focused all his attention and brushed off the attack perfectly\u2026 Or that's what he thought. Unlike Ain, he couldn't manage to do it perfectly.[You've received 15 damage!]He had received some damage because of the angle from which he dismissed Leopard's attack.But Hyun still had a lot of health left, so that didn't make them change their original plan.'Unlike Ain, I'm using a skill while also defending. Doing this much while having my attention span divided into two is impressive enough.'Even if he saw that his magic wasn't working, Leopard didn't give up and cast the spell again and again.His wand pointed towards Ain once more.Hyun naturally changed the target of the buff.\u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb!Whoosh- The moment Leopard's wand illuminated\u2026He shot his attack right in front of Ain.Wiping out an attack coming from a short distance required a little bit more skill.\"Ugh...\"Ain groaned a little bit.The moment she brushed off Leopard's attack, she extended her right hand. Now that she had managed to reduce the distance between them, Ain's first attack began.Claws covered in fire scratched Leopard's white robe.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 823 damage!]\"Ugh... How dare you hurt me! Okay, then I'll erase you from existence!\"Leopard hit the ground with his wand.Whoosh\u00a0- A magic circle appeared around him, and the air around him began fluctuating.Hyun already knew what was about to happen.\u300cBack off!\u300dAin had already moved backward before Hyun shouted.Leopard finished casting his spell.Thousands of ice pieces, sharp as a knife, began rotating just like a tornado.It was a perfect defensive shield that could block both physical and magical attacks.Leopard had just used his perfect defensive skill, \u00abSnow Shield\u00bb.\"What are you going to do now? Are you feeling the powerlessness of being a criminal who has dared to defy a celestial being?\"Leopard was undefeatable as long as the rotating ice pieces didn't stop.Since it was impossible to get closer, attacking him wasn't possible.But Hyun already knew about this skill, so he had already thought of a plan to counter it.If there were no way to destroy \u00abSnow Shield\u00bb, he wouldn't have dared to challenge Leopard.'Now!'Hyun was watching Leopard from behind when he jumped right into the snowstorm.Throwing himself into a tornado made of thousands of ice pieces as sharp as a knife seemed silly.If another person saw him doing, they'd probably think he had committed suicide.Of course, Hyun wasn't planning to die so easily.\u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb\u00abShield\u00bbHyun applied his two skills to himself at the same time.Thousands of ice pieces attacked him, but more than hurting, they tickled him.Hyun's HP wasn't decreasing at all.It was all thanks to the 50 defensive stats that his \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb gave.If it was against a skill that consisted of many small different pieces attacking simultaneously, his \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb was practically invincible.Crumble-All the rotating pieces of ice fell to the ground at the same time.Leopard's defensive skill had been canceled by \u00abShield\u00bb.The requirements to activate \u00abShield\u00bb were different from other defensive skills. Instead of the user, it depended on the enemy.He used to criticize this skill because of this same reason. But right now, what he thought was a weakness was playing in his favor.Hyun didn't need to penetrate Leopard's defense\u2014activating \u00abShield\u00bb and jumping at him was enough.[ \u00abShield\u00bb's casting cooldown has been reset! ]And there was another thing\u2026Every time he got hit by an opponent's attack, the cooldown time went down by five seconds.It was a skill that had been designed to counter Leopard's \u00abSnow Shield\u00bb perfectly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 - The Spirit that Wanted to Become a Heavenly Being (2)Because of the snowstorm, Hyun had become completely frozen.He was able to block the damage, but he couldn't do anything against the abnormal status.\u201cPlease free me!\u201dThe moment Hyun shouted, Ain used her flames to melt down the ice.You couldn't hurt the same party members, so Hyun didn't receive any damage.Leopard was still stunned because of \u00abShield\u00bb.Fwoosh- Ain rapidly ignited both hands.Leopard, who didn't have any protection, was fully exposed to Ain's attack.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 852 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 841 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 830 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 848 damage!]...Every single attack ended up being a critical hit. Ain had managed to land more than ten attacks on Leopard in just an instant.Although it looked like a cat scratching a post, so it didn't look cool.\"Ugh... How dare you humiliate me like this?! Playtime is over. I'll kill you both right now!\"The moment Leopard woke up from the stun, his white robe had turned black because of Ain's attack.But he was so angry that he didn't even care how he looked.Whoosh\u00a0- Leopard's wand began vibrating.He was about to cast \u00abSnow Shield\u00bb again.Ain quickly stopped attacking and backed off.Hyun once again ran towards the snowstorm.The cooldown time of his skills had already refreshed.Crumble- The \u00abSnow Shield\u00bb stopped before the ice pieces could even begin spinning.Ain unfroze Hyun while attacking Leopard.\"Ugh...!\"Leopard's eyes had turned red.His white skin, just like his robe, had become tanned.Normally, humanoid boss monsters had good defensive skills but low HP.If Leopard couldn't use \u00abSnow Shield\u00bb, he was just a named monster that could attack fast.Maybe not so weak, but that comparison wasn't that far off.\u300cHe isn't using that anymore.\u300d\u300cArtificial intelligence has gotten really good. There isn't a notable difference compared to real people.\u300dHe hadn't used that skill again after they\u2019d managed to cancel his \u00abSnow Shield\u00bb twice.Was it because he had discovered that they could counter his magic very easily?That was when the real fight started.Hyun used supporting skills from a distance. Ain and Lepard were each spitting out fire and ice.\u2014The fire and ice mixed with each other.Even though it was a fight between Magicians, it looked like a battle between two Warriors.Since Ain preferred fighting from a close range, Leopard couldn't move away, even if he wanted to.Because of how fast Ain was, Leopard couldn't increase their distance.Ain covered her hands in fire and landed attacks that were critical hits most of the time.Every time Leopard's wand shone, Hyun used his \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb.Seeing Ain brush away the ice attacks from a really short distance was certainly very impressive.Hyun could already see how the battle would end.She used to play as a werewolf.In close-range combat, you need to be able to read your opponent's next move. In those types of fights, even he was no match for her.Not only that, but she was also good at psychological warfare.Even if it was a named monster, she wasn't someone a mere Magician could win against.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 843 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 835 damage!]Just as she thought, in Ain's system message, there were only alerts that said that the attack had been successful.At some point, the fight became one-sided.Ain mixed feints in her attacks; sometimes, she changed the timing and rhythm of her attacks just to screw with Leopard.From time to time, Leopard tried to activate \u00abSnow Shield\u00bb, but it always failed.Every time his skill activated, Ain just backed off and waited for him to be stunned, then she resumed her attacks.Hyun smiled bitterly. Watching the boss being beaten up was like looking at himself a few days prior.If he were in Leopard's place, he would have logged out.\"This can't be... A celestial being like me can't lose to insignificant earthlings like you!\"Creak-!With the sound of the surrounding air freezing, an incredibly cold chill came out from Leopard.It felt like he was about to freeze the entire world.Leopard had just used all the mana he had left.Even Tarr Tarr, who had been watching everything that had happened from a distance, froze for about 20 seconds.Ain covered herself in flames and protected herself from the cold. She then used those same flames to melt Hyun, who had frozen.Right at that moment, a rotating piece of ice flew towards them, but at the perfect timing, Hyun's \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb skill activated; Ain used that opportunity to brush off his attack.\"It's over,\u201d said Hyun.Ain nodded.That magic Leopard had just used that looked like it would be able to freeze the entire world was his last card.He used that technique when he only had 5% of his HP left.Since he didn't have any mana left, Leopard was just a punching bag.\"See? I told you we could beat him.\"At Hyun's smile, Ain replied with a low tone of voice.\"You're right... I honestly thought that you were being unreasonably optimistic. I was even prepared to die.\"\"It isn't like there weren't any dangerous moments, but I've always believed in you.\"\"Huh...?\"At Hyun's confession-like reply, she stretched her waist.Suddenly, Ain's hand got covered in a fire. She was feeling shy after hearing Hyun's words.With her hands covered with fire, she hit Leopard many times consecutively. Then, they got a message from the system.[The Forgotten Magician Leopard has been defeated!][You've cleared it with a party of two people!][You're the first ones to defeat Leopard! Your Magical Power has permanently increased by 5 points!]-\u00a0 Leopard was born as a normal human being. But from the first moment he learned about the Heavenly Beings, he had yearned to become one of them. Later on, he convinced himself that he was a Heavenly Being, and during his lifetime, he tried to reach the Sky City. But he ended up being executed by the orders of the Royal Family. You've successfully managed to end his misery. Bravo!\"He's already dead... Why are you still hitting him?\"\"...\"Ain kept punching Leopard's corpse for a while.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *It had been three weeks since Asrian Online had opened its doors.Players in the Hall of Fame had surpassed level 40.The user in the number 1 ranking was at level 50.Other players were rapidly catching up.They were no longer the unofficial number 1.But it wasn't like they hadn't made any progress. Just taking a glimpse at their status windows was enough to see that their stats had improved a lot.Hyun (Lv. 47)HP: 658/658Mana: 450/450Job: Support (Hidden)[Strength: 2] [Agility: 48] [Vitality: 14] [Magical Power: 45] [Empathy: 120]Skills - <+Open List>[\u203b You have 46 unused skill points!]Ain (Lv. 46)HP: 460/460Mana: 1680/1680Job: Close Range Magician (Hidden)[Strength: 23] [Agility: 60] [Vitality: 10] [Magical Power: 153 (+15)]Skills - <+Open List>[\u203b You have 45 unused skill points!]Titles - <+Open List>Their stats had changed a lot!Hyun felt happy just by seeing the status window.If his status window got leaked on the internet, the boards would go crazy.The sudden appearance of someone who had remained in the dark and with stats that didn't match the level would make everyone astonished.It was all thanks to the first kill bonus rewards.Those past few weeks, they had managed to kill 18 hidden named monsters.When they had fought Leopard, their Magical Power had already gone up by 5 points. That's the equivalent of leveling up two or three times.When you level up, you get two stat points, so their current stats were equivalent to a player of level 90.It had a different meaning than leveling up to 90 as fast as possible.'The initial growth rate becomes completely different... When I reach level 90, I'll have the stats of a level 130 player!'Despite all this, they decided to stop the hidden named monster hunting temporarily.The more levels a hidden named monster had, the stronger it became. Not only that, but they also had a more diverse attack and defense pattern.Leopard was probably the last hidden named boss they could safely win against.Thanks to defeating many named monsters, their inventory was full of rare items.They sold the items they didn't need to the blacksmith for the highest price possible.As of then, they weren't using the Auction House because the rare items were being sold for money rather than gold.Even if he posted the item on the Auction House, how many users had thousands of gold coins to use?'The only item left is this one.'He hadn't sold the items that could be useful to a Support, but among them, there were some he wasn't sure about.[ Leopard's Wand (Unique) ]Requirement: [Magical Power 130]<A piece created by Leopard while trying to replicate what the heavenly beings use.

At this point of the game, there shouldn't be a lot of users with unique items, and that one had a lot of specs, even for a unique item.'It really isn't useful for me.'Since the Support's main stat was Empathy, they didn't benefit from the increase in Magical Power.Also, the fact that the weapon of choice wasn\u2019t important for a support was something most RPG games had in common.Then, was it useful for Ain?Not really.'There's no way she'd use a weapon like a wand.'For Ain, whose attack consisted in covering her hands with fire, using a handheld weapon was impossible.From the information they'd gotten up until then, the weapon of a Close Range Magician was a glove.'So... It seems like there's only one way to deal with this.'Hyun was thinking about item enhancement.Item Enhancement consisted in transferring one item's special effects to another one.Every big city had an item enhancer. But even in Asra Online, he really didn't visit an item enhancer frequently.The first reason was that it required you to spend a lot of money.The second reason was that the success of an enhancement depended on probability.If the item enhancement failed, you would lose both the item and money.'I've sworn not to use the services of an item enhancer ever again...'It reminded him of the time he lost the Sword of the Supreme Being.That nightmarish day, he had lost both the item and money.He was so angry that he couldn't even cry.He was able to cry when he was in bed and about to sleep.'But there's another way\u2026'If the only way to get good items was via item enhancing, he couldn't avoid going to see the enhancer.\u2018Wait\u2026\u2019Hyun was about to give up when a thought came to his mind.Hyun began wondering about something.'Why am I worrying about Ain's weapon? Shouldn't each person worry about their weapons?'It seemed like he subconsciously thought that she was his underling, and that's why he probably felt that he needed to get her a weapon.However, when he found himself in a difficult situation, the self-sustaining instinct kicked in.He was using Ain as an underling only when it benefited him. That really said a lot about what kind of human he was. But at the moment, he wasn't mature enough to realize that.* * *32 rare armors.Eight rare accessories.Nine rare weapons.One unique weapon!While hunting hidden named monsters, he was able to obtain 18 items.The items he didn't need, he had put them in the auction house, and thanks to that, he had gotten 20,000 gold.Now he had nine rare items and one unique left.Hyun tried to distribute the items in the fairest way possible.\"The unique item is probably worth ten rare ones. Ain, you should get the unique weapon; I'll grab the rest. Regarding the gold, we can just split it into two.\"Hyun got all the rare items, and Ain got Leopard's Wand. She seemed to have no complaints.\"Now, we should start getting equipment. Ain, maybe you should try item enhancing for your weapon. Oh, if either of us requires more money, each should go and hunt independently.\"After saying that, Hyun glanced at Ain.If they thought they weren't getting a fair deal, people with a bad character would start screaming and swearing.\"Well, I don't mind.\"Ain didn't seem to care.Hyun clenched his fists in joy.Of course, discreetly, so Ain wouldn't notice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 - The Day Things Don't Work Out (1)Hyun and Ain teleported to Loupra, one of the biggest cities of the Magic Country.Even at night, the streets of Loupra were full of life.In the Magic Country, artifacts that resembled neon signs illuminated the streets.It was like looking at the night view of a big city.The most important building of Loupra was the one that belonged to the Magician's Guild.Something that looked like an artificial sun was orbiting through the installations of the building. So even at night, inside the Guild, it was bright as day.They were using an artifact similar to an escalator to go up. They were there searching for the Guild's item enhancer.\"Everyone... Is looking at us, right?\"Ain asked Hyun with a low tone of voice.\"I think it's because of how we're dressed.\"It wasn't their imagination. Everyone, from the guide to some clients, was looking at them.He was wearing the 'The Ghost Commander's Robe of Darkness' he had gotten while hunting ghosts.Hyun and Ain were wearing dark clothes, so in the eyes of some NPCs, they probably looked like suspicious people.\"Are you Dark Priests? This place isn't somewhere your kind can enter. Get out immediately!\"The NPCs didn't try to hide their distrust towards them.Hyun denied it before the misunderstanding deepened.\"No, we're not dark priests!\"\"Then... Why are you wearing those clothes?\"\"We're 'users,' we got these clothes while hunting!\"\"Hmm...\"The NPCs of the game knew about the existence of users.From their point of view, they had come from another dimension and were fundamentally different from them\u2014that's why they gave users a lot of freedom.After ten minutes of explanations, they finally let him go.\"Damn it. I'll throw away these clothes as soon as possible.\"Hyun felt the need to change his robes and equipment quickly.After walking for a while, they finally arrived at the Item Enhancer Department on the third floor.The interior looked like a luxurious department store's jewelry shop.The Magician, who was reading a book reclined on the sofa, looked at the awkwardly standing Hyun and Ain.\"Are you clients?\"\"Yes, we're clients,\" Hyun answered with an awkward tone of voice.The Item Enhancer began explaining.\"The prices are like this: Magic Items: 500 Gold, Rare: 2,000 Gold, Unique: 8,000 Gold. Ones from a higher category depend on each case. The success of the item-enhancing process isn't guaranteed. So even if it fails, there's no reimbursement.\"After giving a cold and concise explanation, she again turned her eyes to the book.\"Once you're ready, give me the items you're going to give magic and the ones that'll be used as materials.\"\"Excuse me... Do you have a dressing room?\"Hyun asked while carefully raising his hand.The item enhancer looked at Hyun. Then she hit the desk with her wand.At that moment, both Hyun and Ain teleported to the room next door.Hyun was flustered because the scenery had changed suddenly. But after seeing through the blind the place where they'd just been, he understood what had happened.\"Is this a remote teleport magic circle...?\"\"Yes, I think so.\"\"It seems like that woman's level is quite high.\"Drawing a magic circle that allowed another person to teleport required a third rank ascension.Because Hyun and Ain's levels were low, they were teleported before they could notice what was happening.Thud-Hyun took out the rare items inside his inventory he had obtained after beating the hidden named boss monsters.\u2014From a full-body armor made of steel to a light one made of leather.Lastly, he took off the 'The Ghost Commander's Robe of Darkness.'\"I'll finally be able to throw this old and rugged robe away.\"\"Isn't the design okay?\"\"No, I mean\u2026 They say that it's better to throw away the old stuff, right? It's better to change items frequently.\"He had been wearing that robe since level 20. If it were real life, it would probably stink.Hyun was about to take out from his inventory a robe worth three gold that the only good thing it had was the design when he noticed something weird.Ain was acting differently from usual.'Did her eyes shine...?Now that he thought about it, she'd been acting weird.Ain was walking in circles around 'The Ghost Commander's Robe of Darkness.'She was staring at the item as if she was analyzing it.She also got closer to the robe and placed her nose on it.\"Ain, what are you doing?\"As Hyun called Ain, her shoulders shrugged.It was as if she'd awakened after being hypnotized.\"Umm... I was just... The smell... No, not that. I was just trying to see how much durability it had left!\"\"Durability...?\"\"Yes...\"\"It should be similar to yours, right? After all, we began wearing them at the same time.\"\"R... Right? Since we began wearing them at the same time...\"Hyun thought that Ain was acting weird but decided to ignore it.Even normally, he couldn't understand what Ain was thinking.It wasn't like she thought of something ridiculous once or twice.\"Then I'll go first. Come out when you're ready.\"As Hyun walked out of the dressing room, the Magician looked at him and said in a dry voice.\"Rare item enhancement costs 2,000 gold. You need to pay first.\"\"Hmm... It's a little bit expensive.\"Hyun had a grim expression while taking a huge sum of gold out of his inventory.He was about to blow the money he had saved up through a lot of effort in enhancement.The moment he took out the money, the Magician took out a scroll.He didn't have time to mentally prepare for what was about to happen. The normal rarity robe began to shine.The process didn't even take three seconds.A few moments later, Hyun got a message from the system.[The item enhancement has failed.][The Brilliant Pauldron of the Water Dragon (Rare) has been destroyed.]\"...?\"* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Hyun couldn't understand what was happening. He just stared at her blankly.She looked at him as if nothing had happened.After a while, words came out of Hyun's mouth.\"Was that a try?\"\"Yes, and it failed,\" she coldly replied.\"Are you going to try again with another item? A rare one costs 2.000 gold.\"More than being dishearted by the results, he was getting annoyed.Was item enhancement supposed to end so quickly?It was true that item enhancement was done with one click in Asra Online.He thought there would be some kind of special effects in Asrian Online, a game that used the latest technology.'Anyways, the enhancement has failed, huh? Well... I wasn't expecting for it to be a success on the first try.'Hyun took out the next rare item.Dale's Armor.It increased your HP by 20%, and when hit with an opponent's attack, it decreased the amount of damage received by 30%. A great new item would be born if the item enhancement was successful.\"Please, try to proceed slowly.\"She nodded, but Hyun felt that talking to her was as if he were talking to a wall.The Magician took out a scroll from the drawer.Plaf\u00a0- He heard the sound of the wand hitting the desk. Then he received the same message.[The item enhancement has failed.][The Armor of the Fallen Knight Dale (Rare) has been destroyed.]\"Here's 6,000 gold. I'm not stopping until I get a successful enhancement!\"\"Understood.\"She took out three scrolls and hit them with the wand.The item enhancement that took a huge sum of money was over instantly.[The item enhancement has failed.][Istal's Life (Rare) has been destroyed.][The item enhancement has failed.][The Blue Light Bone Armor (Rare) has been destroyed.][The item enhancement has failed.][Lamyla's Armor (Rare) has been destroyed.]He got three consecutive messages that said that the item enhancement had failed.He subconsciously hit the desk of the NPC with both hands.\"Are you kidding me?! How is this even possible?!\"The probability of success was 50%. Shouldn't at least one have been a success?\"Isn't this rigged?\"He had blown up 10,000 gold plus five rare items in just an instant. For a moment, he became blind because of anger.\"My money! My items!\"Hyun was about to make a scene but suddenly stopped.Next to him, the Magician was applying pressure on him.\"Be quiet.\"Just a stare was enough to suffocate him.She seemed to be using magic to apply pressure on his heart.He was short of breath and could feel his blood circulation accelerate.If it were real life, he would've been seriously worried about possible side effects on his body.\"If you make a scene in the shop, I'll have to take measures. I don't decide whether an item enhancement will be successful or not. The success rate depends on your luck.\"Once the Magician stopped applying pressure on him, he could finally breathe normally.'A game that can control how you feel, huh? I almost lost my mind...! Also, can a shop employee treat the user like this?'At that moment, he felt that a game using the latest technology had many cons.'That's not important. Right now, I need to think about how I'm going to recover the gold and items I've blown up!'10.000 gold and five rare items had disappeared in just an instant.They were items he could have sold at the auction house for at least 1,500 gold each.'I can't go back to hunting named monsters, but it will be hard from now on without good items...!'Until then, he'd been able to confront enemies without any items. But from that moment on, things would get consistently harder.He needed to have the best items and new skills.But the item enhancement process had ruined all his plans.It reminded him of what had happened in Asra.Once again, he had to struggle because of the success rate! It made him want to cry.At that moment, he heard the woman's voice that made him want to cry.\"The percentage of success is low, but it has been successful.\"\"...?\"Hyun lifted his head.There was a pair of gloves that had holes in the fingers on Ain's hands.It was just a normal pair of gloves that they'd just bought.

The success rate of unique item enhancement is less than 20%, so I thought that it would fail.\"Although the Magician had a mean tone of voice, at least he agreed with what she said that time.He had failed five times to get a successful rare item enhancement, but she had managed to get a unique item enhancement with a success rate of just 20%.'This damn game...'He couldn't understand what had happened.'This is all probably because of my bad luck. The unique item enhancement was probably successful because I offered five rare items as sacrifices.'\u2018Yes, there's no way that it's possible to get a unique item enhancement on your first try!\u2019\u2018This means that I was partially responsible for her success. Then it should be okay to ask for compensation. Right?\u2019Hyun was thinking about nonsensical things when he saw another light coming from the side.It was weaker than before but still enough to make Hyun surprised.\"Another success. But why would anyone embed a rare item in such a ragged thing?\"\"It isn't ragged,\" Ain replied to the item enhancer.In her hands, she had a black robe.It was the 'The Ghost Commander's Robe of Darkness' he had just thrown to the floor.[ The Ghost Commander's Robe of Darkness (Rare) ]Requisite: [Level: 20], [Holy jobs can't use this item.]<The robe that the ghost commander used to wear.

You're giving that to me...?\"Hyun was having a hard time closing his mouth because of the surprise.To be honest, he didn't like the robe because of the color, but that was when it didn't have a rare item embedded in it.Hyun was feeling happy.'It was worth raising her up! She knows how to pay back her benefactor!'Hyun looked at 'The Ghost Commander's Robe of Darkness' again.\"Huh, wait a minute...\"He felt slight discomfort.It wasn't anything notable, but he felt it was slightly different from the robe he had been wearing until recently.\"Is this mine...?\"Hyun mumbled.Ain was shaking just like a little kid who had been discovered while making mischief.\"The durability seems too low.\"\"Uh... T... That's... Probably because...\"Ain stuttered.When Hyun looked at her while wondering what had happened, she became flustered.\"Oh, what probably happened is that the durability got cut down in the process of enhancing.\"\"Really?\"Hyun scratched his head.Well, that really didn't matter.The durability could be increased. The cost of repairing a damaged item was almost free compared to enhancing one.A weapon for a Support, clothes for Ain, and other armors\u2014they still needed a lot of things, but there was no need to hurry. If they kept getting the necessary items one by one, eventually, they would be fully equipped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 - The Day Things Don't Work Out (2)Since there was only one server in Asrian Online for the whole world, many things became trending news.People posted new threads in the communities with different strategies or videos all the time.'Asrian Online' was the game with the biggest audience on most streaming platforms.Users often recorded their gameplays or downloaded different footage to make a highlight video and post it on YouTube.Since there was a lot of footage being uploaded all the time, most videos were buried, but some of them quickly became a hot issue.On Reddit's biggest Asrian Community, a video was rapidly becoming a hot topic.<Two Person, Named Monster Clear Footage!>The title of the thread was written to grab any Asrian Online player's attention. In just a few hours, it was on Reddit's main page.You could see a guild trying to clear the raid in the video.Since the guild members in the video were very skillful, some were relatively famous among the community.- Two-person clear? Isn't this a 20 people annihilation?At the beginning of the video, you could see a party of 20 being defeated. That's why many people thought that it was just clickbait.The video's highlight started when two people dressed in black robes appeared.Those two moved as if they'd been playing together for many years.After seeing how they brushed off the named monster's attack, people felt cathartic.The most amazing thing was that they could defend themselves against an attack that couldn't even be seen.It was so incredible that you could even hear the person recording saying, \u201cHow did they do that?\u201dThe reason why no one commented for many minutes was that everyone was watching that scene repeatedly.- Is this Lattice?Lattice.The user that had posted that name had the most upvotes.Lattice was at level 50 and thus, the number 1 player in the hall of fame.Even though Lattice was at the top of the rankings, no one knew who the person was behind that character. That was because Lattice didn't make public appearances.- If one of the two is Lattice. Who's the other person?- It seems like one is doing all the damage. The other player appears to be supporting.- But both have an amazing level of control over their characters. How many users are skillful enough to brush off an attack as fast as that with their hands?- Oh my god. How are they doing that? I've never thought that something like that was possible.It was unfortunate that the video was recorded from a distance. Because of the snowstorm going on, you couldn't see very well what was happening.- Is that person really Lattice? Because of the black robe, the face can't be seen. Well, it isn't like we know how Lattice looks or anything.- Are you all stupid? They're obviously NPCs.People began to take seriously what one user had commented.- They could very well be NPCs. Unlike users, they aren't carrying weapons. Not only that, the skills they use are completely different. Their skills aren't among those that a Warrior, Thief, Magician, or Priest has available.- They could be using hidden jobs, right?- My friend, getting a hidden job isn't something as simple as asking your mom to give you something.Among the replies, there were some nonsensical ones.- The person inside that robe is a woman! If you look carefully, you'll notice that something stands out around the chest area!Even though that post was written as a joke, it didn't change the fact that he was able to analyze the image with very sharp eyes. Sadly, no one took him seriously.- loool, it's true that the height of that user is low... But I don't think what you've said is true.- Go find your waifu somewhere else.That post had received more than a thousand comments in just one day.Some people discussed whether brushing off that attack with bare hands was even possible, but most were more interested in the identity of the two people wearing black robes.After an intense day of debate, most users began agreeing about their identity.- It seems like they really are NPCs. Considering many things, that's the only possible answer.- Do NPCs hunt named monsters?- Someone else has commented about that before. This game's Artificial Intelligence is so advanced that you can't differentiate it from a real human being, so some NPCs act in a very similar way to users.- Then, what country or organization are they from? Both seem to have jobs related to Magician.- There's someone in the comment section that had analyzed both of them. According to that user, they're probably 'Dark Priests.'- Wow... So they're really NPCs? They're amazing... Will a user ever be able to beat high-level NPCs?The one that had uploaded that video was Tarr Tarr.He was sitting alone in the park, on a chair next to a fountain.\"They kicked me out...\"It had happened just a few hours ago.Tarr Tarr was officially kicked out of the guild.He still remembered the cold gaze everyone directed toward him.The only one who managed to survive in the fight against the named monster was Tarr Tarr: that basically meant that he hadn't properly participated in the battle, and that was why most guild members had begun thinking negatively about him.But the main reason why they kicked him out was another thing\u2026The leader of the guild shouted angrily at him.\"Why did you upload the video?! It took us a lot of effort to get information about the hidden named monster. Twenty people died for us to get information on this hidden named monster! But now, the entire world knows about this.\"The leader couldn't calm down and began shouting at him again.\"We're not going to be able to get the title for being the first ones to kill a hidden named monster. And now, a stronger guild will probably take the hunting field from us!\"To be honest, Tarr Tarr hadn't thought very deeply before posting the video.How both users fought the hidden named monster was too cool to see alone, and that was the reason why he had uploaded that video.Seeing the commentaries with the reaction of the people made him excited.Tarr Tarr, who was still a middle schooler, couldn't think and make decisions like an adult.\"I... I'm sorry...\"He was just a kid. Facing such harsh criticism from the rest of the guild members was too much for him.It was his first time learning that someone had to take responsibility when something bad happened.Although he had left the guild on his own accord, it was as if they'd kicked him out.He felt like a criminal, so he didn't dare to face the other guild members; that's why he walked out as if he was escaping.Even though Tarr Tarr was sitting in the park and around him there were many different people, he felt loneliness.He was angry with his timid and stupid self.'I should've let the boss kill me with the rest of the members. Then, I wouldn't have been able to record the video... No, maybe I'm just not fit to be part of a high-ranking guild.'He kept blaming himself for a while, and then he remembered the guild members with whom he had a good relationship.Especially Arneng and Hell Dust.He felt sorry.They'd always told him that they were expecting great things from him, but in the end, he was just a disappointment.He had hid and watched them being killed at the hands of the named boss.'I showed them a pitiful side of me until the end.'He was thinking lots of depressing things when someone tapped on his shoulder. He was able to awake from the negative thoughts.That sensation seemed familiar. Who was it?Tarr Tarr turned his head around.\"Why are you making such an expression?\"\"Yeah, a man needs to be able to deal with situations like this.\"It was Arneng and Hell Dust.They had treated him like their little brother when he was in the guild. Those two were standing right behind him.Tarr Tarr began crying.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Maybe he just needed someone to spoil him.\"I... I'm sorry... Because of me, the guild... Coff...?!\"The hand hitting his back, like always, made his mouth stop moving.\"Why are you sorry?\"\"Because I survived alone...\"\"You should try to live, of course! If it were either of us that was in your situation, we would have grabbed the guild leader by the collar after coming back alive. He pushed us into the enemy's hand without giving us proper information!\"\"Oh, and about the guild.\"Hell Dust immediately replied.\"We also left it.\"\"What?!\"\"Gaming is how we make money to live... So rather than being tied to rules, we feel more comfortable by being free to do whatever we want.\"\"Yes, that's true.\"Arneng agreed to what Hell Dust said.\"But still...\"Arneng suddenly changed the topic and didn't let Tarr Tarr finish his sentence.\"About the video you posted, I think it could cause you trouble.\"Tarr Tarr shrugged.\"About that... I'm sorry. Because I've uploaded that video, everyone came to know about the information on the named monster. I didn't intentionally leak information. Because of me, the guild...\"\"You're not part of the guild anymore! So it's as if they were strangers to you.\"\"Huh? Then...\"Tarr Tarr couldn't hide his surprise. Arneng kept talking.\"Uploading the footage of another user without their permission is wrong. You can generate income through YouTube, so it could create problems for you.\"\"Another user?\"Tarr Tarr was surprised.\"Weren't those two NPCs?\"On Reddit, most people had concluded that those two were actually NPCs. They'd given a very good explanation about why they thought that, and Tarr Tarr had agreed to what those people had commented.Because he had seen that fight with his own eyes, he still remembered the excitement he felt while watching that battle.Especially because Asrian had been barely online for a month, how those two fought was on another level from the rest of the users; that's why Tarr Tarr thought from the beginning that they were NPCs.\"I also thought that they were NPCs in the beginning. I've never seen anyone use the equipment or skills they had. Also, how they were able to move.\"\"I almost overlooked it, but once I watched closer, I noticed something. Take out the unedited video.\"Tarr Tarr opened the footage of that battle as a hologram.While smiling, Arneng pointed to a certain part.He could clearly see footage that didn't make the video's final cut.\"See? When one of them froze, the other one melted the ice using a fire attack. I'm sure NPCs couldn't do something like this.\"\"Ah... Now that you say it...!\"\"They're party members! You can't apply damage to another member of the same party. This means that those two are users.\"Tarr Tarr remembered another similar scene.He had seen the battle happen in real-time.Not only that, he had seen the video over and over again\u2014so he remembered every single scene.There was definitely a scene where one party member melted the ice covering the other person.The fact that they could use the party system meant they were users.If he had put that scene on the edited video, the conclusion of Reddit users would've been different.\"Then, is that Lattice?\"Tarr Tarr asked with a serious expression.\"Well, it could be... But I don't know why, but I think it's another person,\" Hell Dust answered.\"I also think so. From what we know, Lattice is someone that likes playing alone... Even if one of the people that appeared in the video was Lattice, what about the other one?\"\"They're probably users that haven't registered in the hall of fame. This world is definitely bigger than what we thought.\"\"Amazing... There are people on top of the rankers?\"Arneng and Hell Dust were immersed in their conversation, but Tarr Tarr was beginning to feel anxious.If what they said was true, he had uploaded footage of another player to the internet without their consent.\"W... What should I do?\"Tarr Tarr was about to cry.Using the game footage of another person without their consent was a crime. They could take you to court because of it.If they used that footage and sued him, he would definitely lose.\"You need to talk with those people. Since the video has gained quite a lot of popularity, maybe they'll contact you first through YouTube.\"\"It wasn't your intention to earn money from another person's work, so I'm sure you'll be okay.\"\"You didn't even turn on monetization... So you really haven't earned money at all from the video.\"\"But if you get to meet these people, at least say sorry to them.\"Arneng and Hell Dust talked to Tarr Tarr in a mean way to scare him a little bit, but deep down, they knew that he wouldn't get into trouble for something like that.Since gaming was their livelihood, they knew a lot about streaming or uploading gaming footage. They also knew from what point things could get serious.Not only that, if trouble were to arise, they were willing to help Tarr Tarr deal with it.On the other hand, Tarr Tarr was frightened. He thought he should try to find the people on the video as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 - The Day Things Don't Work Out (3)Lately, Hyun and Aid had been properly hunting for the first time since they began playing the game.Level 110 elite monster 'Cursed Subject.'According to common sense, it wasn't a monster that could be hunted down by users that weren't even level 50.Just one hit could put their lives in danger. Not only that, but users of level 50 usually struggled to overcome the defense of monsters that were above level 100.But what would happen if you could deal damage far above what an average level 50 player could?[Critical Hit! You've dealt 2514 damage!]Every time Ain's hand touched the 'Cursed Subject,' it burned while crying in pain.Even considering that its body was made of wood and that fire was its weakness, it was a ridiculously high amount of damage.\"Wow... Is such an amount of damage even possible?\"The damage output of Ain's skill was above what a level 100 user could achieve.'Ain currently has 170 magical power...'The Close Range Magician's skill, \u00abFlame Claws\u00bb, dealt damage five times the user's Magic Power.On top of that, you had to add the numerous bonuses of the weapon.\u2018Increase Magical Power by 30%\u2019.\u2018Increase Elemental Damage by 50%\u2019.Also, Increase Critical Hit Damage by 30%\u2019!By using a weapon, she had increased the damage output 2.5 times.A unique item was truly something amazing. It was worth the amount of gold they had spent on the item enhancement.'Still, there's a clear weakness.'Even though Ain's Magical Power was 170, she only had ten stats in vitality.Since she only had 500 HP, only one mistake would be enough to kill her!Ain played as a glass cannon: she could deal an amazing amount of damage, but her body was like a piece of paper.'Well, it really doesn't matter as long as she doesn't get hit.'The reason why Ain could grow in such an unbalanced way was thanks to Hyun.Some elite monsters could deal AoE damage or targeted attacks that you couldn't avoid.Even if you were a skillful player, you couldn't avoid heavy rain.Some of the monsters' attack patterns affected the area around you, so you couldn't overcome them with your controlling abilities.That's when Hyun's support shone.Thanks to \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb and \u00abShield\u00bb, Ain could focus on the offense.One day after they began hunting elite monsters, they achieved their main goal.[You've leveled up!][Since you've achieved level 50, you've fulfilled all the prerequisites! Now you can do the awakening quest!]Hyun closed his eyes while a light that showed he had leveled up covered his body.\"Level 50... Finally...\"Hyun thought about everything he had gone through after getting the Support job.It really was torture.\"Hyun, what are you doing with your eyes closed?\"Hyun was so focused that he couldn't even hear Ain's question.He had decided to stick with the Support job and not raise a new character for that precise moment.\"Finally... I can learn the ultimate attack!\"After reaching level 50, everyone could learn something called an Awakening Skill.In Asra, everyone called it an Ultimate Attack because of convenience.It was a skill that was so strong that it could change the flow of the battle in your favor.It was an attack that could create an overwhelming advantage.It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that after level 50, most people's combat style was centered on the Ultimate Attack.'I've saved up all my skill points for this moment!'Because Hyun had played Asra Online, he knew about the importance of the Ultimate Attack more than anyone.There was no information available about the Support job; that's why leveling up any skill would be foolish.While playing with a job no one else had, what you should do is first learn about its ultimate attack, and then you could focus on the rest of the skills.'Now, should I start the epic awakening quest?'But Hyun needed to remember something.After getting the Support job, things rarely went smoothly.The system sent him more messages.[The Support shines while playing with others!][You can't complete the awakening quest alone!][You need to do the quest accompanied by another person with similar conditions as yours!]Hyun seemed confused by the messages.\"What's this...?\"\"Did something happen?\"\"It says that I need to form a party with another person to do the awakening quest.\"Hyun tried to guess with the information he knew.Hidden jobs usually walk a different path from regular ones.From one point of view, you could say that it was the privilege of a hidden job. But on the other hand, it was a variable the hidden job had to bear.The requirement of completing the quest with another person was probably because of the Support\u2019s (Hidden) job characteristics.\"Should I help you?\"After hearing the explanation, a smile appeared on Ain's face.\"Just as I thought, you need me.\"It was decided.Ain reached level 50 after undoing the party and hunting alone. Her body began shining.Because of the amount of experience that a level 110 elite monster gave, it didn't take Ain a lot of time to level up.[You've leveled up!][Since you've achieved level 50, you've fulfilled all the prerequisites! Now you can do the awakening quest!][Once you enter the 'Awakening Room,' the quest starts automatically!]- The process of awakening tests your abilities, but at the same time, it opens the doors for a plethora of opportunities.- The 'Awakening Skill' you'll obtain depends on your decisions while doing the quest. It will change depending on your beliefs and possibilities.- Face your new self at the end of the road after choosing from infinite possibilities.<Reward>: 1 Awakening Skill.Attention: The number of Awakening Skills you can choose from will depend on how well you clear the quest. So always do your best.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Hyun and Ain entered one of the buildings of the City of Loupra.The Awakening Room.It was a place present in every city that allowed you to obtain a new skill.The interior of it was very luxurious.\"Hyun, are you nervous?\"\"Not really...\"\"I'm kind of nervous.\"The two walked through a corridor that had candles illuminating the path.They saw a strangely distorted space with a twisted door at its end.\"Well, let's go.\"Hyun and Ain walked toward it.The distorted space absorbed them.Everything turned dark. Both felt weird. It was a feeling similar to that when you were about to fall asleep.The sensation of fading consciousness quickly stopped.A slight sensation of floating was left.They felt that this sensation of being in a dream would last forever.It was like drowning in a sea called subconsciousness.'I can't see anything.'He had never felt anything similar to it in Asra Online.It was possible that the game, which tried to recreate a sensation similar to real life, wanted the users to feel the sense of awakening for real.'It's definitely different from Asra.'In the previous game, he hadn't felt anything similar.But in Asrian Online, there were a lot of experiences that felt very real.Hyun and Ain endlessly fell to a sea of darkness.Suddenly, in the middle of that darkness, they could hear the message sent by the system.[You've found a companion!][Get ready, both of your awakening quests will begin simultaneously!]Hyun took a deep breath.Hearing the system's voice in the middle of a dark place made him nervous.[Extracting keywords from player Hyun's subconsciousness.][Keyword: 'Time']Whish-!He was surprised because, suddenly, a floor had appeared under his feet.\u2014It was a circular disk with a diameter of one meter.Once he looked at it more carefully, he noticed something strange.\"A clock...?\"On the floor, he could see roman numbers that went from 1 to 12.The fluorescent hands of the clock were rotating on top of it.Beyond the clock, there was only darkness.Hyun and Ain were standing on top of a clock located somewhere in the middle of the space.The system's alert continued.[Extracting keywords from player Ain's subconsciousness.][Keyword: 'Passion']The moment the message ended\u2014Fwoosh-! The fluorescent hands of the clock and the numbers got devoured by fire.Once the fire was lit, they were able to see the surroundings.A spiral staircase.In their surroundings, they could see a giant spiral staircase.To be more precise, it wasn't giant\u2026 It was vast.It looked like a giant spiral pedestal that connected the sky and earth.Hyun and Ain kept descending through the spiral axis.Endlessly...It was like they were taking an elevator heading under the earth.\"Amazing...\"Hyun looked in the direction from which he suddenly heard a voice.Ain was looking around with her mouth wide-opened.She hadn't noticed that he was staring at her.Was she impressed by how everything had been staged?Well, it was normal for girls of her age to be impressed by atmospheres like that.Although, he didn't know Ain's age.Hyun was thinking about many non-important things when the disk stopped moving.From that point onwards, the quest had officially begun.[The stage customization has finished!]- In order to maximize the potential, we must get closer... A little closer to the subconsciousness!- The deeper you go, the better the awakening skill you can get as a reward!- But the deeper you go, the more chances there are for you to be devoured by the abyss...- Thankfully, you can go back in time once!- Starting the awakening stage!Fwoosh- In front of Hyun and Ain, a button made of fire that said 'start' appeared.Before beginning the quest, Hyun took a deep breath.'I must think carefully...'Awakening quest\u2026The basic rules were simple:The deeper you went, the more possible awakening skills you could choose from.The amount from which to choose was very important, although you could only get one in the end.Basically, the main goal of the quest was to get to the deepest part as possible.'I can go back in time?'That was the part that caught his attention the most.\u2026Going back in time after death.At the end of your life, you get a chance to go back in time to relive your life and avoid committing the same mistakes\u2014it was a story setup that was frequently seen in movies or novels.Since the second time, one didn't make the same mistakes and could do things more efficiently; the previous life's experience and feedback were incredibly important.'Is this possible because of the keyword, \u2018time\u2019? It's really huge if, after dying, I can go back in time and start all over again.'The moment he stopped thinking and stepped forward, he got an unexpected system message.[All your stats have temporarily gone back to 10!][All your skills have returned to their original state. All skill points have been retrieved!][Once you complete the awakening quest, they'll return to normal!]Hyun and Ain suddenly felt weaker.It was a phenomenon that happened because their stats were close to those of a player of level 100, and then they had been reset.Since Asrian Online could control your brainwaves, they really felt as if the strength had left their bodies.\"It feels like my body has become sluggish...\"Ain complained.Hyun smiled bitterly.'There was no way they would give us an amazing feature like going back in time for free! So the penalty is the reset of stats and skill points, huh?'Hyun didn't get desperate.It had always been like that: in order to gain something, you must lose something.That fact had remained the same from the time when he used to be the number 1 in the rankings to the current moment when he was playing a Support.<Current Location: First Basement Level>Hyun looked at the notification at the top of the screen.\"Let's go,\" he said.\"Okay.\"____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 - Learning the Ultimate Attack (1)Whoosh-The moment they stepped on the start button, the clock's diameter expanded tens of meters.A few moments later, a shadow appeared in front of them.Two dark silhouettes.One looked similar to Hyun, and the other one looked similar to Ain.The two shadow figures were robes that covered their faces.Both Hyun and Ain's eyes shone.They couldn't hide their smiles because they'd immediately discovered the identity of the two shadows.\"Those... Are us, right?\"\"Yes, the left one is me.\"Flash-One of the two put on fire both hands.It wasn't just the looks\u2014they also used the same techniques.A pair of red flames burning in both hands\u2026It was a technique he had seen many times.It was the basic skill of the Close Range Magician, the \u00abFlame Claws\u00bb.Hyun understood more or less the situation. Those were them.\"Interesting.\"It'd been a while since Hyun smiled so happily.Do they need to fight their shadow clones?He felt that they were looking down on him.Even if their skills were the same, there were differences.The one controlling the shadow figures most likely wasn't a person; they were probably manipulated by artificial intelligence.That meant they couldn't replicate how they used their respective characters perfectly.That was probably the only difference between them and artificial intelligence.An artificial intelligence NFM is very proud of?Artificial intelligence that feels more like a person compared to a person?Hyun, who had gained a lot of experience through the years, was confident that he would be able to beat it.While warming up, Hyun said to Ain.\"Let's fight each other's shadow.\"\"Good idea!\"Ain agreed.Hyun was going to fight Ain, and Ain would fight Hyun.As soon as Hyun finished talking, Ain's clone tried to attack him, but he was able to avoid being hit easily.'What's happening?'He felt strange.'Is this really Ain?'Because Hyun had fought Ain many times, he could feel the weak points of the AI.[ Imaginary Ain (Grade: 1) ]HP: 60/60Mana: 100/100[Strength: 10] [Agility: 10] [Vitality: 10] [Magical Power: 10]<Skill List>[\u00abFlame Claws\u00bb Lv.0]Hyun was surprised at the status window that just popped out.He was wondering about the stats of the opponent when the information about the Ain clone popped out.Usually, you couldn\u2019t check the status window of another user. You could check the status window of monsters, but you needed to defeat them first.The reason why he could see clone Ain's status window was probably because of the awakening quest.'The stats are almost the same... But how well it controls the character is too different.'The corners of his mouth turned up.Hyun took the shortsword he had been carrying since level 1 from his robe.Burning flames were approaching him menacingly, but he wasn't nervous.'The movements are too obvious.'Even though the flames were right before him, Hyun didn't back out. Instead, he went right into it.'It isn't a real fire. As long as it doesn't touch me, I won't take any damage...'The fire moved upwards.Unlike real fire, you couldn't feel the heat from it. The important thing was to avoid touching the fire directly.Hyun squeezed through the flame and then used his shortsword to cut off Ain's clone.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 23 damage!][Since the damage you've dealt counts for more than 33% of the opponent's total HP, its body stopped working properly!]The shadow's head fell off.The moment its body got separated, it turned into fire. And finally, it was absorbed by the darkness.\"Easy.\"Ain had also finished her battle and had come to Hyun's side.\"Did you finish?\"\"Yes, it was too weak compared to you.\"Ain faltered for a while but then finally opened her mouth.\"While I wasn't looking... You didn't do anything weird to my shadow, right?\"\"Anything weird...? Like what?\"\"Like... Not letting it move... Or doing... Fuu...?\"Ain murmured.\"Huh...? What are you talking about...?\"Hyun thought for a moment that he had misheard something, So he tried to ask what she had said, but sadly, they didn't have time to chitchat.The awakening quest still hadn't finished. And soon, they heard another notification from the system.[As a reward for clearing the first trial, every party member will be awarded temporary stats points!]<Reward>[Temporary Stat Points] +20[The second trial will start soon! Please distribute the points as fast as you can!]Hyun nodded after hearing the system notification.The awakening quest\u2026He was starting to understand how it would take place.It was like a dungeon crawler. Each time you went deeper into the dungeon, you received rewards.Every time you clear a quest, you receive skill and stat points. If you die, the quest ends.No, since it said you could turn back in time, you probably had another chance.Anyway, the basic rules were simple: If you went down a floor, you received a reward that made you stronger. Ultimately, the deeper you went, the more stats you received.'So this is why it reset our abilities at the beginning.'Bonus stats\u2026Hyun spent five points in agility and 15 in empathy. Ain used five points in agility and 15 in magical power.They used the points the same way they usually did to return to their normal selves.Creak- The clock that had been used for the previous stage began descending.<Current Location: Second Basement Level>* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *In the middle of the darkness, two flames rose, and those two flames turned into a set of shadows.Imaginary Ain (Grade: 2)HP: 150/150Mana: 300/300[Strength: 10] [Agility: 20] [Vitality: 15] [Magical Power: 30]<Skill List>[\u00abFlame Claws\u00bb Lv.2]Except for the stats going up, there didn't seem to be any noticeable changes, but the feeling he got from the shadow was slightly different.'She looks different...'While taking little steps, she walked around Hyun.\u2014Just like a wild animal about to attack its prey.Hyun flinched after seeing that the corners of her mouth had turned up slightly.'Did that thing just smile...?'Seeing a black entity smile gave him goosebumps.It looked like the shadow was starting to imitate Ain.Maybe the lower they went, the closer the artificial intelligence would get to a real human being.If that were the case, the shadows on the lower floors would get quite annoying to deal with.Hyun was starting to get nervous.Whish-In an instant, Hyun's right hand that had the dagger flashed.Three sharp lights were drawn in the direction of the shadow's neck.Even if the artificial intelligence evolved, they still couldn't compete against Hyun and Ain.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 21 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 19 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 22 damage!][By attacking the same part repeatedly, you've damaged more than 33% of the opponent's HP!]Once again, the shadow that had lost the neck disappeared after burning.After finishing the fight, Hyun looked at Ain, who was still in the middle of combat., but it didn't take too long before it was over.\"Shall we continue?\"\"Sure.\"Once they beat every enemy, the floor got caught in a fire again.As the clock hands began rotating, Hyun and Ain continued to descend through the darkness.[As a reward for clearing the second trial, every party member will be awarded temporary stats and skill points!]<Reward>[Tempory Stat Points] +40[Temporary Skill Points] +20[The third trial will start soon!

But what's that interrogation mark skill?'He didn't have much time to think about it.The shadow had already launched an attack.'Damn... \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb!At that moment, the shadow twisted her arms a little bit.Hyun got a flashback.\u2014A scene from the past overlapped with the present.\u2018I remember this...!\u2019It was a technique Ain often used!He remembered seeing it very often while training.It was a technique that consisted of twisting the arm; thanks to that, it expanded the trajectory and forced the opponent to account for the changed timing of the attack.'Do you think I'll fall for this?'Hyun instinctively took a step forward.It looked like a fire moth throwing itself at the enemy.He wasn't trying to commit suicide, of course. Everything was calculated.You could negate an opponent's attack by attacking at the same time.'Good!'Was it because he didn't avoid the attack? Her posture became off, and he took that opportunity to use his short sword.He aimed for the joint but couldn't land a critical hit because she twisted her body a little bit.[You've managed to deal 22 damage!]Since there was no time limit, he didn't need to hurry.Hyun, without hurrying, slowly damaged the opponent.Even if the artificial intelligence had gotten smarter, he was still better.'I don't have to make any mistakes until the end... I've almost defeated her.'After a few minutes, Hyun was able to bring the shadow's health to less than 10%.Now all he needed to do was cut the shadow a few more times, and then it would turn into fire and disappear, and he would be able to go down to the next floor.But something unexpected happened when Hyun blocked the opponent's attack with \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb.Crash-!The shield broke, and Hyun's arms received damage.[You've received 58 damage!][You've lost more than 33% of your HP, so your body stopped working properly!][You've lost your left arm!]\"What...?! But I blocked it with \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb! Unless the damage output suddenly becomes higher\u2026?!\"Up until then, he had been able to block this attack with \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb. The only possible explanation for what had happened that he could think of was a bug.Hyun opened the shadow's status window.[ Imaginary Ain (Grade: 3) ]HP: 41/450Mana: 272/600[Strength: 10] [Agility: 35] [Vitality: 30] [Magical Power: 60]<Skill List>[\u00abFlame Claws\u00bb Lv.2]...[\u00abSurge\u00bb Lv.0]- When your HP goes below 10%, the amount of damage you deal doubles.After taking a glimpse of the status window, Hyun immediately knew what had happened.The shadow had a passive that increased the damage it dealt when it was low in HP.The reason why she was able to break his \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb was because of that passive.\"Damn...!\"Hyun blamed his carelessness.He had underestimated the opponent. Not taking into consideration the passive skill was a fatal mistake.Hyun had lost his left arm as a price for his mistake.'With my current state, can I keep winning?'Even if he cleared this floor, there was a chance that he wouldn't recover his lost arm.If he began the fight with one less arm on the following floors, the difficulty would increase by a lot.They say that misfortune never comes alone, right?Hyun heard another message from the system.[Your party member, Ain, has died!][She cannot revive until you turn back the time!]\"???\"Hyun's mind was full of question marks.He thought he had heard something wrong.Two shadows appeared in front of him.Hyun opened his shadow clone's status window.Imaginary Hyun (Grade: 3)HP: 112/300Mana: 108/200[Strength: 10] [Agility: 25] [Vitality: 20] [Magical Power: 20] [Empathy: 40]<Skill List>[\u00abThe Heavenly God's Protection\u00bb Lv.8][\u00abShield\u00bb Lv.2]\"What is that skill?\"Hyun was surprised because the shadow clone had a skill he didn't remember seeing.After thinking for a while, he remembered that there was something he had missed.'Oh yeah, \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb isn't the original name.'The real name of the skill was something like \u00abThe Heavenly God's Protection\u00bb.Ain: Hyun, can you hear me?Since Ain had died and couldn't talk, she tried to contact Hyun via the capsule machine.At that moment, the shadows began attacking him.Hyun avoided their attacks and was going around in circles through the stage.\"How did you die?\"Ain: It was a mistake.\"That's why I'm asking what killed you.\"Ain: I got hit by a strange skill.\"Strange skill? I don't remember seeing anything like that in my clone's status window. It only had the normal Support's skills.\"Ain: I'm sure there was something else. I had full HP when it suddenly went to 0!Hyun's doubts deepened.He couldn't believe that a Support that didn't have any offensive skills was able to kill Ain with just one hit.Hyun opened the shadow clone's status window again.\"Maybe... Is it this?\"\u00abThe Heavenly God's Protection\u00bb.An incredible description unfolded before his eyes when he opened the skills description.- Increase all defenses of any target within 20 meters by 100 points for one second.- You can create a \u00abVision Sword\u00bb that has an attack equal to the total of the absorbed damage.(Required Mana: 50)- The Vision Sword lasts for (Empathy/100) seconds.<Cooldown Time: 10 seconds>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It basically seemed like a weapon summoning skill.\u2026But the most amazing thing was its spec!\u00abVision Sword\u00bb's attack was equal to the damage absorbed.So the stronger attack he managed to defend against with \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb, the stronger \u00abVision Sword\u00bb he would be able to get.'This... Is almost like a completely different skill from \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb.Hyun tried to think if the skill was actually worth it.It had amazing potential.For a moment, he thought that he must have been sleeping.\"Is it real...?\"Even though he had lost an arm and his partner had died, Hyun couldn't help but smile.\"It's an offensive skill!\"Hyun laughed like an edgelord, just like he always did when he felt good.At that moment, Ain's shadow charged toward him.\"That one also looks like a powerful skill!\"He dodged the fire and immediately counter-attacked.After two attacks, Ain's shadow, whose HP was already nearing zero, turned into fire and disappeared.\"First of all, let's eliminate these guys.\"The Support shadow was easier to deal with.Ain had lost because of the incredibly high amount of damage she could deal and not because of the opponent's strength.What happened, probably, was that her attack was absorbed, and then the shadow counter-attacked with the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb.But a Support didn't have any high damage offensive skill, so the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb wouldn't be a menace to him!It didn't take Hyun a lot of time to defeat his shadow.Whish-Once the opponents were defeated, the clock began moving again, and its hands made of fire began rotating.He was about to go deeper.[As a reward for clearing the third trial, every party member will be awarded temporary stats points!]<Reward>[Temporary Stat Points] +80[Temporary Skill Points] +50[The Support's Awakening Skill \u00abInverse Shield\u00bb has been unlocked!][The Close Range Magician's Awakening Skill \u00abMagical Power Rush\u00bb has been unlocked!][Warning: You can choose only one Awakening Skill, so before choosing one, think about it carefully!][You'll get some rest time!

In some rare cases, some lost in the first round.If that happened, you were forced to choose between 3 'Basic Awakening Skills', but they were different in terms of quality compared with the skills you could obtain on the higher difficulty floors.The deeper you went, the better skill you could obtain, and you only had one chance to do it right, at least until you reached level 100\u2014this made many users laugh or cry.'Oof... This is when it really begins.'Most people weren't able to beat the third trial, so Hyun was already above average.But from the fourth trial, the difficulty increased a lot.If until the third floor, it was the tutorial, from the fourth floor onwards, it was like the wall of lamentations.To obtain the sweet rewards, one had to go through very hard and difficult trials.'How should I distribute the skill points?'The fourth-floor trial was probably going to be very similar.Hyun tried to think about possible strategies.He thought about a strategy he wanted to try before going back in time and resurrecting Ain.'Finally, my time has come... I'll be able to deal damage as a Support.'He spent all the temporary skill points he had in 1 Second Immortality.The points necessary to level up were 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 20!Cling- Cling- Starting from 0, the skill level went up until the number 8 appeared.There was a big jump from level 7 to 8 because that was probably the section where the skill evolved.[ \u00abThe Heavenly God's Protection\u00bb Lv.8 ]- Increase all defenses of any target within 20 meters by 100 points for one second.- You can create a \u00abVision Sword\u00bb that has an attack equal to the total of the absorbed damage.(Required Mana: 50)- The \u00abVision Sword\u00bb lasts for (Empathy/100) seconds.<Cooldown Time: 10 seconds>Hyun changed the skill's name that had been reset to \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb.It was probably okay to express it as 'absorb\u2019 since it was a skill that created a sword with an attack that was based on the amount of damage you could defend against.Okay, as long as one ignored the horrible naming sense.\"I need to increase my stats!\"He put 45 points in Empathy, 15 points in agility, and 20 points in vitality.Agility was very important. If he was slower than the enemy, there would be attacks he wouldn't be able to avoid.He had increased his vitality because the difficulty would probably raise a lot from that point onwards.Since the damage enemies dealt would increase, he had to avoid getting killed in one shot.Ain: Hyun...

He ended up finding the answer to his question in previous memories.'I remember!'[\u00abSophisticated Magic\u00bb]- Increase the magical attack range of an ally by one meter.- While attacking an opponent, if the target is within the increased attack range, the damage they receive increases by 1.5 times.That was probably the reason why the fire had suddenly gotten bigger.The attack range of the Close Range Magician had increased by one meter.'If it touches me, I'll die!'While thinking that, Hyun tried to get as close as possible while using \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb.Ain's shadow landed two attacks on him.'I survived!'Thanks to \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb, he survived by a narrow margin.He saw an opening on the opponent's chest that would allow him to land critical hit damage.\u00abVision Sword\u00bb.Once he activated the chained skill, a cyan-colored sword appeared.He pointed the two-meter cyan sword toward her heart.Since he had absorbed the attacks of both hands, the sword's potential damage output was double the attack of Ain's clone.That meant that the damage dealt would probably be in the thousands!Crash-!When he thought that the attack was a success, he heard the sound effect of his shield breaking.'This...'It was the sound that \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb made when it couldn't withstand the incoming attack.When Hyun turned his head around, he saw another shadow standing there.That's right. There was more than one enemy.The shadow Support had used the same technique to protect against his attack.Whoom-Following that, just like he had done before, Hyun's shadow summoned a \u00abVision Sword\u00bb.'Damn!'Hyun rolled sideways.The wind generated by the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb brushed past his eyebrows.Hyun sighed in relief. He had barely managed to survive.'I almost died as soon as the battle began...!'Since that \u00abVision Sword\u00bb had absorbed his attack, the damage output was probably at least one thousand.He felt as if a death scythe had almost cut his throat.Ain: An attack is coming from behind!\"Tsk...!\"While biting his lips, Hyun instinctively lowered his waist.The fire attack went past his back.\u2018Did I avoid damage?\u2019Even if he had managed to survive, the attack wasn't over yet.Just like Aid did, the shadow of the Close Range Magician attacked while using both hands.\"Ugh...\"Hyun avoided the attack by rolling on the ground.However, the Close Range Magician's fire attacks didn't have a cooldown time.As if the shadow was making fun of him, consecutive attacks came toward Hyun.'I should have increased my agility more!'Ain: Be careful!Whish- He subconsciously managed to brush off a silver attack that flew towards him.[You've received 52 damage!]The Support had his hand extended towards the front.The attack covered in silver light was probably a skill he used.\"Did I have a long-range attack...?\"Hyun sighed.[\u00abSupporting Fire\u00bb Lv.0]Throw a Vision Shortsword at an enemy within 30 meters and deal [Empathy] x3 as damage.<Cooldown Time: 30 seconds>There was nothing more bothersome than a long-range attack that came out of nowhere.If that scenario of avoiding and blocking the enemy's attack continued, he would eventually die.[You've received 55 damage!]The remnants of the fire brushed past his body.Even after using \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb, he hadn't been able to block the damage completely.[You've received 32 damage!]That time, it was the Support's long-range attack.He had managed to brush it off with his hands, but since he hadn't used \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb, he received damage.[You've received 49 damage!]Ain: Hyun! If this continues, you'll die! Let's turn back the time!\"Wait.\"Ain closed her mouth.She felt that Hyun's voice had changed from before.\"Watch closely.\"After saying that, Hyun suddenly remained still in his place.Immediately, the attack of the two shadows came toward him.If Hyun kept remaining still, the fire would soon devour him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At that moment, a shield was applied to her.It was the effect of 1 Second Imm... \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb.The Support had used his defensive skill to protect his partner.Whish-!Hyun's body rotated and changed direction.Instead of the Close Range Magician, Hyun was in front of the Support with just one movement.Ain: Oh...Ain's mouth was wide open.It was a familiar move.The technique Hyun had just used to change the direction and timing of the attack was originally hers.'Did I fool you?

Summer was almost over.The chilly wind felt good.Hyun felt that the cold was cleaning his body, which still felt hot because of the battle he just had.He was lost in his thoughts while entrusting his body to the wind.'How should I deal with this quest?'The average user wouldn't think so much about it.Most people gave up after seeing how difficult it was.Some people were proud just because they had been able to reach the fifth floor and didn't even try to clear it.But Hyun was the former number 1.SeoHyun was more strict with himself than most people regarding video games.Was this really the end?Was it impossible to advance?Could he approach things from a different point of view?He asked himself an endless amount of questions.This endless pursuit was probably the reason why Hyun was the number 1 player of Asra Online by an overwhelming difference.'The wind... Is too cold...'As time flowed, the wind began getting colder, so Hyun decided to go back to the room.After thinking for one more minute.'Wind...'* * *The moment he pressed the letter \u2018Start\u2019, the quest began again.First floor.'Let's go.'Ain nodded at Hyun's words.Fwoosh- From Ain's small hands, a fire ignited.At the same time, two shadows appeared.It took them three seconds to clear that stage.Hyun let Ain deal with them alone.Since it was their last chance, they had no time to waste.They had to do things fast and effectively.They just had to advance as fast as they could.The second and third floors were very similar. The only difference was that the shadows had a little bit more HP and were more intelligent than the previous floor.The third floor was where Ain had died, but because they knew their opponents, she didn\u2019t make the same mistakes as before.The second floor took them 30 seconds and the third one a minute.Hyun and Ain went to a deeper part of the subconscious.Fourth basement level.It was a floor where he had struggled. But back then, the shadows had their stats and skills hidden, so all he could do was try to be as careful as possible.'This time is different.'[The fourth trial will start soon! Please distribute the points as fast as you can!]The stage stopped descending.Fwoosh- Two giant flames rose, and from the air, two shadow figures showed themselves.\"Are you ready?\"Ain didn't answer.Even if she didn't answer, they knew what each other thought, so talking wasn\u2019t necessary.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The moment Hyun returned from breathing fresh air\u2026Both were in the lobby talking about possible skill combinations.Among those, the one they discussed the most was the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb.\"The attack of the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb equals the damage absorbed.\"\"So the stronger the attack you defend against, the better. Right?\"\"Yes, that's true... But there's another way.\"Hyun continued with a smile on his face.\"That other way is defending against quick consecutive attacks.\"\"Quick consecutive attacks?\"\"Yes. Multi-strike moves.\"Since Ain wasn't following him, he explained it to her in more detail.\"Even though I've called it \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb, the truth is that it can't absorb every single attack. After all, the real effect of the skill is increasing all your defensive stats by 100 points. The moment the opponent's attack surpasses a thousand, I'll take damage.\"\"For example. If I receive an attack of 5000, after counting in the extra hundred points in defense, I'll receive 3300 damage... That's enough to kill us with one hit.\"Hyun explained to her how damage and defense work in great detail.\"Have you memorized all these formulas?\"\"Obviously.\"\"Woah... I do things based on intuition.\"The conversation was about to be cut short because of Ain, but Hyun kept explaining to her.\"Anyway. If I manage to survive being hit with an attack of 3300 damage, the Vision Sword will end up with a 1700 attack. It's simple math. It's not like 1700 is a low number, but...\"Hyun smiled.\"But what would happen if I receive the 5000 damage divided into equal parts? For example, getting 10 attacks of 500 damage in one second.\"\"An attack of 500 can't do anything against \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb. Since I can perfectly defend it, the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb would end up with an attack of 5000!\"\"What you're saying is that \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb goes well with consecutive attack skills, right?\"\"Yes, that's right! And you can use those on me!\"But finding a skill that checked all the necessary conditions was hard.Most of the Close Range Magician's attacks dealt a high amount of damage.Ain stopped thinking.Fourth Basement Level.While they were feeling sweat drop from their hands because of the heat, the shadows made a fancy entrance.She didn't panic and moved as they planned.[Type: Wind]Not only is firepower important for a Close Range Magician! You also need to take care of your speed!But be careful. The wind is very picky!- Now you can learn wind attacks.- [\u00abFlame Claws\u00bb] changes to [\u00abThe Touch of The Wind\u00bb] while using this element.Normally, all of the Close Range Magician\u2019s attacks were of the fire element, but by using the skill points correctly, you could unlock other elements.'Wind' was one of those.Whoosh-A strong wind began to blow.Ain felt the raging wind pressure on her body.She felt as if the coolness was washing her whole body.'The one who found this was Hyun.'[\u00abExecution Island\u00bb Lv.4]- One second after you pick a target, you cut the opponent 12 times. Each cut deals [Magic Power] x 2.5 times damage.- If the opponent moves while the attack is active, the skill stops.- If you attack an opponent that's under an abnormal status effect, the skill stops.(Mana Required: 150)<Cooldown Time: 15 seconds>The theory behind the skill was simple:You had to attack an opponent that didn't move.The name \u201cexecution\u201d really fitted it.The sum of dealing 2.5 times the Magic Power 12 times was over 30 times the Magic Power!If you managed to hit every time, you could achieve abnormally high damage.But Execution Island had a fatal flaw.\u2014The opponent had to be standing still for it to be a success.Only one hit out of twelve would land if the opponent moved even once.During a fight, no one would be dumb enough to be standing still.A skill that you cannot properly use is the Ultimate Trash Skill.The requisites were too hard to fulfill even for a high-risk, high-reward skill.'It isn't high-risk.'Ain remembered Hyun's explanation.By using Hyun's strategy, there was no risk to the skill.[You've left the party!][The party has been broken!]What Ain did next was something that, at first glance, didn't make sense.Why would a sane person leave the party just before an important quest? But since this was something they had both agreed on, no one was in shock.\"Then, I'll hit you.\"Swoosh- Wind started covering Ain's body.The robe's hat fell off, and her hair got blown by the wind, revealing her eyes as well.She was looking in the direction of Hyun.Ain seemed a little bit embarrassed.\u00abExecution Island\u00bb!The second the short casting ended\u2026Both of Ain's hands shone brightly.Swish-! The wind blades swept through Hyun's body and played a devastating melody.Each attack dealt 300 damage approximately.Twelve of those swept through Hyun's entire body.\"Oof...\"Hyun sighed.Whir- The light surrounding Hyun vibrated while making a loud noise that it didn't make before.The colors of the lights went from being blurry to a clear white one.\u2018I wonder how strong the force I have inside of me right now is.\u2019Just thinking about using so much force made him feel chills.\"This... Is going to be interesting.\"Hyun took one step while making a creepy smile.Both shadows were coming at him.Just a little while ago, they had put his life in danger. But at that moment, he was getting excited at the thought of getting back at them.\"I wonder what the damage output will be.\"Hyun launched toward them like a rocket.Whir-First, the Close Range Magician.Aim for the neck\u2026'And cut it at once!'Clang-!He planned to cut the shadow's neck, but things didn't work as expected.[You've dealt 392 damage!]Whir- Whiiir-A lot of blue lights were protecting the shadow Close Range Magician.That was the Support's awakening skill.He had already used the Awakening Skill \u00abInverse Shield\u00bb.Hyun smirked.The deeper they went, the more clever the artificial intelligence became.The fact that it had noticed the danger of Hyun's attack meant that the shadow knew how to calculate damage.'Although that won't help you.'Swish- The moment the cool-down time of the skill went back to 0, 12 lights attacked Hyun's body again.That time he targeted the shadow Support.\"You were able to protect yourself by using the Awakening Skill.\"Whir- In Hyun's hands, there was a huge sword.He brandished the sword.\"What are you going to do next?\"A flash went through the shadow.Until the very end, the Shadow Support tried to survive by using \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb, but it was useless.I'll kill it with one hit...![Critical Hit!

    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 - Starting from Zero (2)Anyway, the moment her partner died, the Close Range Magician activated her ultimate attack.After he thought about it, he had killed her without giving her enough time to use the ultimate attack last time, so it was his first time seeing it.\"I hope it isn't something bothersome.\"Fwoosh! From her entire body, flames began to wriggle.As her body burned, the tips of her fingers became sharper, and ears made of fire that resembled those of an animal appeared.\"Oh, that's...!\"Ain's eyes began to sparkle.The shadow started to take the form of a beast.\"Wolf...?\"\"Woah...!\"Hyun smiled bitterly at the sight of Ain screaming in excitement.He had forgotten that the someone next to him used to be a werewolf.\"Look at that. The fur is made of flames...!\"Ain sounded excited.\u2018Even if they beat the fifth floor and unlocked a stronger ultimate attack, she's probably going to pick the one that lets her become a werewolf. Right?\u2019Although, since she was the main damage dealer, he wished that she\u2019d choose a stronger ultimate attack.Whish-Hyun approached the shadow.Even if she used the ultimate attack, she wouldn't be able to defend against the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb.[You've dealt 5481 damage!][You've dealt damage that equates to more than 33% of the opponent's HP with one hit!][You've cut her right arm!]In one hit, the fire werewolf lost her arm.Fwoosh- Fwoosh-\u00a0Instead of blood, fire came out from the part where the arm was cut off.He had targeted her neck with the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb. But after becoming a werewolf, the shadow had become faster, so he couldn't cut her precisely.But that lasted for a few moments.Once Ain's \u00abExecution Island\u00bb cooldown became 0, the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb in Hyun's hands began emitting light again.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 10,578 damage!]A streak of silver light cut through the wolf's body.Before the upper half of the shadow could touch the floor, it burned and disappeared.[As a reward for clearing the fourth trial, every party member will be awarded temporary stats points!]<Reward>[Temporary Stat Points] +250[Temporary Skill Points] +150\"Is this the end?\"\"No... The real trial starts now.\"The happiness of having cleared the quest cleanly lasted for a short while. Hyun began preparing mentally for what was about to come.While the stage descended, he used the bonus points.He had already thought about how he should distribute the stat points.Ring-From 250 stat points: 100 to agility and 150 to empathy!Ain used a similar ratio to distribute her stat points.[The fifth trial will start soon!]After they had finished distributing the points, they gulped while waiting.Before the fight began, Hyun checked his stats once more.'I'm in perfect physical condition.'Was it because he had warmed up while experiencing the fierce battle a few minutes ago? His reaction speed was almost at its limits.Hyun looked at Ain. She also seemed nervous. After all, it was the first time she was challenging the fifth trial.\"How are you feeling?\"\"You don't need to worry about me. It's like a duel, right?\"\"Yeah, that's true.\"[You're about to enter a very deep place of your subconsciousness! Hold onto your consciousness so you don't lose yourself!]Finally, the stage stopped descending.The hands of the clock began rotating faster.\u00a0Fwoosh- Two giant flames rose and disappeared.Two shadows were standing in the place where the giant pillar of fire had been.\"Be careful. They'll come right at us.\"Whish-Just as Hyun thought, one of them charged toward them as soon as they appeared.But as soon as the stage began, Hyun and Ain had also started moving. They wouldn't lose to the same tactic twice.Ain used \u00abExecution Island\u00bb, and Hyun absorbed it with \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb, then he used the damage absorbed to summon the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb.\"Good!\"Both hands of the Close Range Magician had turned into claws of more than one meter that resembled those of a giant beast.Ain's clone looked like an unbalanced monster because of the contrast between her small body and the giant claws on both hands.\u00abEfret's Claw\u00bb.Just like Hyun's \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb had evolved to the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb, Ain's \u00abFlame Claws\u00bb had evolved into a new form.The claws were big and hot.'Fast...!'The speed increased significantly because the shadow's movement skills and the attack had combined.Not only that, but because the claws had become bigger, the attack range had increased too.The moment the claws were about to tear him apart, Hyun countered it with the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb.Slam-!The moment both attacks hit each other, an explosion occurred in the air.A sound loud enough to tear down the eardrums shook the surroundings.\"Ugh...\"* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The pain he could feel in his hands made Hyun groan.Although Hyun wasn't hurt, he couldn't resist the effect of the impact, and his body bounced back.But\u2026Even while flying backward, Hyun had a slight smile on his face.The Close Range Magician had also bounced back, just like him.'She also has low Strength.'From what he remembered, Ain's clone only had 10 points in strength.The strength stat decided the side-effect of the shock, so the distance of the bounce back should be the same for both.Also\u2026[\u00abImpact Amplification\u00bb Lv.5]- Gives extra strength to the attack to push the opponent away.- The distance of the push is increased by 3x[Empathy]%<Passive>Hyun had invested a lot of points in a skill.Usually, he wouldn't have spent so many points on a skill like that, but he had just invested 100 points in it.'I won't be able to win in close-range combat.'Hyun didn't think he could win against the Close Range Magician in a battle within a short distance, considering the advantage that job had in terms of attack range, agility stats, and movement skills.'Then the answer is making sure she can't get close to me!'He wouldn't be able to deal damage just by pushing her away, but it didn't matter.From the start, increasing the distance was the main goal.Ain had also learned a new skill.[\u00abWind Barrier\u00bb Lv.3]- You can create a wind barrier in any place within 10 meters.- The higher the skill level is, the thicker the barrier becomes.Whir- The air cushion that formed mid-air caught Hyun.Hyun stepped on the wind and once again charged toward her.'Good, now!'\u2014Attacking the Support while the Close Range Magician was falling!The synergy between the Support and the Close Range Magician wasn't as simple as one plus one.Their synergy was so good that the moment they stuck together, they equaled three, so dealing with both of them became that much harder.Hyun's strategy of dealing with them consisted of separating both of them.He would do that by sending the Close Range Magician flying, then eliminating the Support.Imaginary Hyun (Grade: 5)HP: 150000/150000Mana: 1000/1000[Strength: 10] [Agility: 80] [Vitality: 750] [Magical Power: 100] [Empathy: 200]Skills - <+Open List>Awakening Skill - [\u00abSoul's Mirror\u00bb Lv.0]Hyun quickly closed the status window of the Support. He didn't have time to read the skills one by one.He focused on the Support\u2019s HP.150,000It was lower than he thought.Maybe catching him would be easier than he initially thought.Whir-For the rest of the time left, the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb shone.The two consecutive cuts went so quickly that it was worthy of praise.[You've dealt 13,502 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 25,917 damage!]Two consecutive attacks of a damage output of five digits!Since Ain's Magical Power and skill level had risen, the attack of the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb had increased too.Once he finished the attack, the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb's light disappeared.Now he had to wait until the next cooldown.\"Ain!\"Nod- After nodding, Ain charged toward the Close Range Magician.Her role was separating the Close Range Magician and Support even further.\u00abWind Barrier\u00bb.Invisible barriers rose.Ain slowed down the Close Range Magician by placing wind barriers in her running path.In the end, more than 20 seconds passed before the Close Range Magician reached her partner.All the important skills\u2019 cooldown times were at zero again.'Good. The cycle is just as I expected.'Hyun smiled at the Close Range Magician that was approaching him.He swung the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb toward the opponent.\"You just stay far away!\"Boom-! A loud sound was made from the impact of both attacks and made Hyun and Ain's shadow bounce back.But Ain was behind Hyun.A soft impact supported Hyun from behind.A barrier made of wind.Hyun immediately used the wind to leap forward.That time, faster than before![You've dealt 12,972 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 26,786 damage!][You've dealt 13,912 damage!]He cut the Support three times.'Good.'Hyun clenched his fists in delight.Each time he landed a successful attack on the Support and his HP went down, his heart beat faster.'One more time...'The status window said that the Support had 50,000 HP left.Only 1/3 was left from that initial intimidating 150,000 HP.With two or three critical hits, he would probably be able to defeat his clone.The moment he was starting to get his hopes high\u2014\u300cAin, be careful!\u300dSuddenly a beam of light flew towards her.Without any warning, a sharp attack flew in Ain's direction.Ain heard Hyun's voice a little bit late because she was dealing with the Close Range Magician, but she still managed to react somehow.\"Woah...!\"Ain subconsciously twisted her waist.The white light brushed Ain's collar and tore it apart.The Support had used \u00abSupporting Fire\u00bb to target Ain.After making sure she hadn't taken any damage, he sighed in relief.\u300cThat has a cooldown time of 30 seconds. So you'll be okay for the next 30 seconds.\u300d\u300cUnderstood...!\u300dTime kept flowing.Once the cooldown time for \u00abExecution Island\u00bb went to zero, Ain used it on Hyun, and the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb regained strength.At the same time, Hyun's heart began beating faster.According to his calculations, he could perfectly kill the Support within the next few attacks.'Now!'Hyun had 250 points in empathy.He could maintain \u00abVision Sword\u00bb for 2.5 seconds.'During that time, I can perfectly cut him five times!'Even if he didn't get a critical hit, he could probably finish off the shadow Support.\"With this...\"Was it that the opportunity in front of him had clouded his thoughts?Hyun had forgotten about the approaching Close Range Magician's existence and focused all his attention on the Support for a moment.\"... I'll eliminate one!\"His hands trembled a little bit.But he clenched his teeth and rapidly cut the shadow.Whoosh- Whoosh-.Five attacks rapidly cut through the Support.Hyun furrowed his eyebrows.During the last few cuts, he couldn't feel anything.It was as if he had cut through the air.Fwoosh-.The shadow Support began to burn.But there was something different from before.Unlike before, he didn't disappear. As time passed, he began getting bigger.Fwoosh- Finally, the shadow became a giant pillar of fire and shook the ground.\"Wh-what...?\"Ain asked, frustrated.\"He didn't die?!\"Hyun rapidly opened the status window of the Support.Seeing how he could open the Support's status window, he hadn't died yet.He had a bad feeling.'This isn't good.'He could see the details of the awakening skill that had remained hidden until a while ago.<Awakening Skill>[\u00abSoul's Mirror\u00bb Lv.0]<Can you look at the other person with the same eyes used to look at you?

(You need to receive the permission of the other party!)- It lasts for 20 seconds.<Cooldown Time: 24 hours>In the place where the Support was standing, a fire was growing as if it was about to tear the earth apart.The pillar of fire that pierced the skies soon began losing its power.Behind the flames that had died down, he could see another silhouette that resembled Ain.The Support had copied the Close Range Magician.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 - Starting from Zero (3)'His HP... Is full?!'Fwoosh-In the hands of the shadow that used to be the Support, flames appeared.The small flame soon grew and took the form of a claw made of lava.Hyun knew what that was.It was the evolved form of the basic skill of the Close Range Magician, the \u00abFlame Claws\u00bb.It was a superior skill called \u00abEfret's Claw\u00bb.The beast's claws flew toward him.\"Damn!\"Hyun shouted while backing off. But at the same time, his heart sank.The attack range had increased a lot.If \u00abFlame Claws\u00bb had an attack range of 2~30 centimeters, \u00abEfret's Claw\u00bb had one of 1~2 meters.'I can't evade this...!'Not only did the attack range increase, it was also incredibly fast.Hyun wasn't sure how much damage that attack could deal. What he knew was that he would have a hard time defending against it.He was predicting his death when\u2014Poof-!With a loud sound of air bursting, Hyun bounced back because of the shock.[You've received 22 damage!]He turned his head around and saw Ain with her hands on her chest.She had used the basic wind skill to push Hyun.Hyun rapidly rolled to the ground and got up. The dangerous situation wasn't over yet.From behind and the front\u2026The two Close Range Magicians had launched a joint attack.'I have to dodge both...?'Except for \u00abShield\u00bb, the rest of their skills still had cooldown time left.Especially Ain's \u00abExecution Island\u00bb skill, which had eight seconds left before it could be used.The only possible way out of that situation was using superhuman reflexes to avoid being hit.The moment an attack reached him, it would be game over.\"Concentrate...!\"Hyun was talking to himself, but it also served as a warning for Ain.Could he dodge both attacks?No, he had to!'Coming!'The claws in both hands\u2026Hyun stepped back in a diagonal line.With one movement, he dodged both attacks.He was able to find a safe point subconsciously.But he began to feel uneasy.The reason was that he had dodged the attack too easily.'Did they make a slow attack on purpose...?'Hyun made that guess after that short exchange of blows.He was right.Immediately, a faster attack flew toward him.A red half-moon flashed as if it was about to tear Hyun's body down.\"Ugh...!\"Hyun hit the floor with his feet and began running.The flame brushed the back of his feet.Even though he didn't take any damage, he couldn't relax since the shadow was running in his direction.Just like a beast hunting down a herbivore animal, the shadow used both hands to try to smash him.That sight made Hyun's face turn pale.'Damn...!'As soon as he landed on the floor, he twisted his waist to the side.The claws brushed past his back and nose.Smash- The claws went through the floor that was made of metal.If he hadn't dodged the attack on time, he would've been smashed instead of the floor.'I'm running out of ways to avoid the attacks...!'The shadow slammed his arms down and then began rotating the claws faster.The shadow was trying to cut him in half, taking the opportunity that Hyun had lost his balance due to dodging consecutive attacks.'Damn, my body is moving too slow!'Hyun clenched his teeth. At that moment\u2014Bang-!With a loud sound, a system message appeared in front of him.[Critical Hit! You've received 132 damage!][Because your HP has dropped to less than 20%, the effect of 'The Blood Fairy's Frenzy' has activated!][Your speed has increased by 50%!]He saw Ain's figure passing by when he looked at his side.She had her arms extended and was using the wind to push him.\"Dodge it properly!\"Fwoosh- Before Ain could finish the sentence, the claws had already come closer to Hyun's chest.He tried to bend his waist but fell to the ground because he couldn't balance himself.Immediately, flames flashed past his field of vision.'One more attack is coming...!'He stood up.Because of the buff given by the item, Hyun was capable of doing things that were impossible for most people.While on the ground, he used the strength of his ankles to rotate his body and run.The claws scratched the ground and passed near him.Of course, it also swept where Hyun was.Whir- In front of Hyun, who had jumped into the air\u2026Suddenly, a translucent block appeared.\u00abWind Barrier\u00bb.Why did Ain place it here?For what purpose?\u2014He didn't ask questions like that.There must have been a reason.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Hyun stepped on the wind barrier and leaped forward once more.Right before Hyun used a double jump into the sky\u2014Swoop- Giant claws made of flame scratched the air beneath him.The owner of those claws was the other Close Range Magician.The one targeting Ain had suddenly changed direction and charged toward Hyun.Ain put a Wind Barrier without any warnings because she probably didn't have enough time to warn him.\"The skills have refreshed!\"\"Use them immediately!\"Swish- Knives made of wind slashed Hyun's skin and charged the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb.However, she couldn't use \u00abExecution Island\u00bb to the last stroke because it was canceled.Hyun had moved before Ain could finish.The reason why he did that was that claws were coming at them at an incredibly fast speed.\"Okay, this is more than enough...!\"Hyun dodged her claws by somersaulting, then he shouted.\"Ain!\"['Hyun' has invited you to a party. Will you accept?]Two Close Range Magicians were coming at them from each side.They looked like a pack of lions about to hunt prey.Four fire claws were targeting both Hyun and Ain at the same time.Would it be one second until the claws smashed them...?No, sooner than that!Whir-Hyun took out his \u00abVision Sword\u00bb.Spin- Hyun rotated in the air and slashed Ain and the shadows.['Ain' has joined your party!]The timing of the party formation was perfect.The \u00abVision Sword\u00bb slashed through Ain.Crash-! A bright flash and burning fire collided.The impact caused the shadows to bounce back in separate directions.\"Ugh...\"The impact also affected Hyun.The huge reaction coming from both sides made it hard to breathe for a moment.There was no physical pain or HP reduction, but he could feel the side-effects of the impact throughout his whole body.That nonsensical thing happened because of the sensory synchronization.He could only start relaxing after he stopped shaking.\"How did you dodge everything...?\" Ain asked him with a surprised tone of voice.'I'm not sure.'Hyun was also surprised by the fact that he had been able to support the combined attack of both Close Range Magicians.If he knew how to edit videos, he would have probably uploaded this video to YouTube.\"I won't be able to do it again.\"Only a superhuman would be able to resist for more than 10 seconds against the combined attacks of both shadows.\"Hyun, what should we do now? There are two Close Range Magicians.\"\"What about that?\"\"Strategy. Our original plan was to separate both shadows and eliminate the Support first! But now, there are two Close Range Magicians.\"\"Nothing has changed.\"After thinking for a while, Hyun kept talking.\"We just need to send them both flying.

But, we need to try it at least.\"[The party has disbanded!]\"First, hit me once again.\"Nod.Swish- While Ain's wind knives cut Hyun's body, his body got covered by a very bright silver light.Once he took out the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb, the light hit the claws.Stomp-!\"Hmph...!\"Hyun felt the pressure increasing on his lungs, so he stopped breathing for a while.A clash of strength.Neither Hyun nor the shadow could withstand the effects of the impact, so they bounced back.\"Grab me!\"Ain had the magic ready before Hyun shouted.Whir- Behind Hyun's back, a stream of air formed. Then a wind barrier appeared and caught Hyun.'One more...!'Two shadows were approaching him.Hyun stepped on the wind barrier and rushed toward the other shadow.\u2018Deactivate \u00abImpact Amplification\u00bb!\u2019The moment he deactivated his passive skill, he smashed the opponent three consecutive times.[You've dealt 13,245 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 25,424 damage!][You've dealt 12,924 damage!]Because of the increased attack speed thanks to the buff of the 'Blood Fairy,' the three consecutive attacks probably looked like lightning.But it wasn't over yet.\u2018\u00abImpact Amplification\u00bb Activate!'The purpose of the last attack wasn't to deal as much damage as possible.\u2014It was to clash weapons and gain as much distance as possible.Crash-!While being pushed back, Hyun had a smile on his face.\u2018It's going to take you some time to come back.\u2019During that time, he could gain some cooldown time for his skills.Things were going as he planned.The shadows kept trying to approach Hyun and Ain, but every time they did that, they were pushed back by the passive skill.But then, suddenly.Something unexpected happened.Scratch- One of the shadows that was being pushed back by Hyun's passive skill used its claws to scratch the floor.A long vertical line was drawn on the floor, and the shadow was pushed back a few meters.He definitely wasn't imagining things when he saw the shadow lift her head and make a creepy smile.'Is she already broken...?'Whir- Her hands began turning red.He thought that the world was being painted with red color for a moment.It was a strange illusion that made him feel like every color except red was being drawn into a single point resembling a black hole.Hyun's instincts sent him a warning.'This...'It was a skill that the shadow hadn't used before.The skill's cinematics made it look like it was about to devour everything.While feeling anxious, Hyun opened her status window.[\u00abVestige Explosion\u00bb Lv.3]<Everything originates from a single point and permeates the universe, but in the end, everything returns to the point and turns into nothing. This is a technique that can erase existence. This power of making things go extinct resembles the power of a god.>- Gather all the mana around that has been used and shoot it forward.- Gather all mana used within a range of 30 meters within the last 10 minutes and deal [Mana] x [Magical Power/10] as damage.- The larger the amount of mana you gather, the bigger the beam of light will be.<Cooldown Time: 120 hours>Just like a broken film reel, the Close Range Magician was suddenly in front of Hyun.'Too dangerous...!'The sphere in her hands kept being compressed until it became the size of a marble.The smaller it became, the more light was emitted.\u2018What's the attack range of this ultimate attack...?\u2019\u2018Is it possible to defend against it...?\u2019At that critical moment, numerous thoughts crossed Hyun's mind, and he finally shouted.\"Ain, push me!\"Poof![You've received 14 damage!]Ain used the most basic wind skill from behind to push Hyun 10 meters.Instead of stopping there, Ain ran towards Hyun and compressed wind to push him again.Hyun's body was pushed again as if it was hit by a wind combo.[You've received 16 damage!]When the sphere that had been reduced to the size of a rice grain exploded, the entire floor shook, and the debris floated up.They flinched in agony because of the intense light.The ultimate attack, from a distance, looked like a huge beam crossing the earth.The beam that was about 10 meters wide was erasing everything on its path without leaving a trace.\u2014Even the floor of the stage!'What kind of skill has such incredible destructive power...?!'He felt that the loud noise was about to destroy his eardrums, but he couldn't hear it anymore once it reached a certain decibel.\u300cHyun! Look to the side!\u300dAfter hearing Ain's voice, he turned his head around and saw the other Close Range Magician approaching.In her hands, there was also a white sphere shrinking in size.The world began to turn red again.It was the same technique he had just seen.Hyun's face turned pale.'Damn... Another ultimate attack?'Hyun suddenly began wondering about something.According to the skill explanation, the ultimate skill's power increased when more leftovers of previously used magics were left.Then, what would happen if it's used again right after the first attack?Hyun took a weapon from his robe and threw it on the ground.It was the newbie's dagger he had been carrying around since the beginning.Smack- The dagger hit the upper part of the shadow's wrist.[You've dealt 2 damage!]At first glimpse, the results of that attack may seem poor. But what the dagger did was more important than what it appeared.He had changed the direction of her arms from horizontal to vertical.It was something he had been able to do thanks to the passive skill, \u00abImpact Amplification\u00bb.Boom-!The wide laser came out of her hands when Hyun used the dagger to change the direction of the attack.The light blinded them.Because of the side-effect of releasing a massive amount of energy underneath where she was standing, the shadow soared to a very high place.Both Ain and Hyun were overwhelmed by the sight of a 30-meter wide light beam falling perpendicularly to the ground.The light beam erased everything without leaving any trace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 - The People that Observe Hyun (1)A crack began forming on the floor, and soon, it crumbled.[Because the stage crumbled, the energy of the abyss is leaking!][Be careful! A mortal soul can't resist the energy of the abyss!]Black smoke started coming out from the cracks of the destroyed stage.Thankfully, Hyun was able to stand on a section of the floor that was in a relatively good state.Through the cracks on the floor, you could see dark energy that resembled fire.\"Oof...\"Hyun raised his head and saw the Close Range Magician that had just used the ultimate attack was twisting her body in pain.Soon, her body was devoured by the dark flames and disappeared.Seeing it struggle while it was about to die was chilling.\u300cDid she die?\u300dAin's voice could be heard from somewhere.\u300cProbably.\u300dSince the status of the shadow couldn't be seen, she had probably died.Once a part of the floor began to crumble, the balance broke, and even the okay parts started to fall like domino pieces.Hyun tried his best not to get hit by the dark flames.He still didn't know what the black flames were, but he was sure that just being brushed by them would be enough to kill him.It had melted someone with almost 300,000 HP, so there was no need to think about if it was truly dangerous or not.Paf-.Flames tried to strike him out of nowhere, so Hyun rolled to the side.The surviving shadow had targeted Hyun.The remaining Close Range Magician didn't seem to care about the dark flames that could be seen through the cracks on the floor.Hyun opened the shadow's status window and saw that she still had 140,000 HP.It was a lot of HP to take down at once.\u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb!Ain arrived at where Hyun was standing just in time.Swish- After receiving Ain's wind attack, Hyun pulled out the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb and swung it towards the shadow.Crash-!Crack-!That time, the shadow used the fire claws to dig into the floor. Because of that, she was pushed back only a few meters.'It doesn't work anymore?'Hyun stepped on the \u00abWind Barrier\u00bb and swung the sword again while leaping forward.Crash-!Crack-!The shadow once again used the claws to resist being pushed back.'It really doesn't work anymore.'The \u00abVision Sword\u00bb turned off.He had to resist until the cooldown time of the skills was reset.But at that point, he had to be honest...Hyun wasn't sure he could dodge all the attacks of the Close Range Magician while trying to avoid being touched by the black flames.'All the tactics I prepared have failed.'He had no choice but to admit it.\u2014That he was at his limit.However, he wasn't happy with the results.This just showed that it was the limit of his skills.Hyun thought that he mustn't ever forget what he was feeling at that moment.What happened that day would be a great lesson for him.But he wouldn't let things end so easily.He really wanted to avoid using this tactic, which left the results to luck.Because\u2026'Anyone can win with a tactic like this.'Twirl-The claws of the Close Range Magician were right in front of him.Hyun didn't try to dodge or defend against it. He just stood still.\"What are you doing...?! Hyun!\"Even though Ain shouted at him, he didn't move.He just stood there and used one skill.\u00abShield\u00bb.Right after that, the claws exploded, and Hyun turned into light.It really looked like a meaningless death.Ain wasn't aware that Hyun had used a skill, so she looked at Hyun die in a seemingly stupid way.At that moment, Hyun talked to her through the capsule.\u300cWhat are you doing? Attack!\u300d\"Oh! Y-you're right...!\"The shadow that had attacked Hyun was still stunned because of the effect of \u00abShield\u00bb.Ain used the wind to push the shadow to where the opponent had used the ultimate attack and to where the black flames were burning more intensely.Just in case the shadow was able to survive the flames, she kept using wind attacks against where the shadow had fallen.But as soon as the shadow touched the black flames, it disappeared.[You've successfully cleared the fifth trial!]Even after getting the message that announced their victory, the stage kept crumbling.The black flames became stronger and began devouring everything.Hyun, who had become a ghost, looked at the scenery from a distance.[You've reached the floor of the abyss!][This is a place where living persons aren't allowed in! You're losing consciousness!]The rest of the floor crumbled.The black fire covered the entire world.Even if the floor had disappeared, Ain didn't fall.She also didn't get burned by the black fire.In the middle of total darkness, the only thing they could hear was the sound of the system message.[Turning back the time!][Calculating the results from player Hyun's memories.][Even in the middle of a dangerous situation, he was able to read his partner's intentions. That silent communication looked as if their souls were resonating!][The Support's awakening skill, \u00abAssimilation\u00bb has been unlocked!][Since all the memories have been destroyed, you cannot choose another awakening skill.][You've learned \u00abAssimilation\u00bb.][The skill tree has expanded!]\u201cWhat...?!\u201dHyun's voice trembled, even though he had been able to remain calm throughout the battle.That's because the system had automatically selected the awakening skill for him.He experienced a cold sweat.\u2018I've already seen this before, right?\u2019He remembered the nightmarish situation he had to go through during the job selection process.The awakening skill Hyun wanted was the \u00abSoul's Mirror\u00bb that the fifth-floor Support used.\u2014The ultimate attack that allowed you to copy your partner's form and skills.Hyun had been excited at the thought of being able to copy Ain's body and deal a massive amount of damage. So to him, that news was like getting hit by thunder on a sunny day.At the same time\u2026Ain also got the system message.[Calculating the results from player Ain's memories.][Throughout the battle, she never stopped looking at her partner. It was truly a soul-burning passion and dedication!][The Close Range Magician's awakening skill, \u00abPrepared for Extinction\u00bb has been unlocked.][You've learned \u00abPrepared for Extinction\u00bb.][The skill tree has expanded!]\"N... No way...!\"Ain also felt that she was hit by thunder on a sunny day.She was excited at the thought of selecting the Ultimate Attack that she had seen on the fourth floor that allowed her to become a werewolf.She would've been okay with whatever result as long as they let her choose the werewolf transformation skill.But she couldn't select that?!After hearing that merciless system message, she put an expression on her face that made her look like a child whose birthday present had been taken from her.\"Damn...!\"\"Ugh...\"Even though they were disappointed, they didn't lose hope. They opened their respective status windows to read about their ultimate attacks.\"...?!\"After a while, a subtle expression came to Hyun and Ain's faces.For a while, they concentrated on reading the skill's description.Finally, once they closed the status windows, that depression and anxiety had started to turn into smiles.When their eyes met, they couldn't hide their smiles anymore.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\"Woah, that's crazy!\"A man suddenly began clapping while shouting in excitement.That man's name was Fred Gash.He was a genius and one of the main developers of Asrian.Around him, there were other people as capable as he was but from different specialty areas.Physicist Robert Connor!Electronic Engineer Mary Lev!The pioneer of NewAI Engineering, Kang SeongCheol!The genius of programming and simulation, Mori Wataru!They were very famous people in their respective areas.There were other important people on the team, but they weren't present there at the moment.\"How did they do it...?\"Kang SeongCheol was silent, lost in his thoughts.\"They really did it! Then it's my win, right?\"Robert extended his hand, and people began putting a couple of banknotes on top of his hand.\"Hey Kang, explain what happened! You told us that no one would be able to beat the AI that's protecting the fifth floor!\"Even while Mary was trying to interrogate him, Kang SeongCheol was still lost in his thoughts.\"Is it the environment? Yeah, there were a lot of unexpected variables... If the map hadn't broken, they wouldn't have been able to clear it so easily.\"\"Hmm, I don't think so.\"Mori, who had been watching everything silently, replied to what Kang SeongCheol said to himself.\"The variables you're talking about probably hindered them more than being of help. If there weren't those black flames, they would've probably cleared the stage more easily.\"They had been watching both users since they reached the fourth stage of the awakening quests.At first, it was mere curiosity. But as time went on, they couldn't stop watching them. They had even stopped what they were doing.Seeing them play had the power to immerse people as if it were an action movie.Finally, after the awakening quest was over, they began discussing what had just happened.\"What do you guys think about the awakening skills they obtained? Won't it break the balance of the game?\"\"There's no way to know that. It will depend on how well they can use those skills.\"\"Isn't that Vision Sword too broken?\"Mary, who was the only woman among them, asked a question.\"That skill is capable of dealing 30,000 damage with just one hit? That's an incredible amount of damage that not even a level 250 user should be able to do easily!\"\"We can't judge how OP a skill is just because of that. To deal such a crazy amount of damage, both have made many sacrifices,\" Robert said to Mary, who he thought was annoyed because she had lost the bet. He kept explaining.\"To optimize the damage output of a skill, they've made many sacrifices. If one of the two weren't present, they wouldn't have been able to achieve this, so it isn't very effective if you think about it.\"\"Even so, the balance...!\"\"Calm down. You know we can't touch the balance of the game.\"Mori tried to calm everyone down.\"Asrian is a complete world in itself. Also, there's nothing we can do about it since there's only one person who was the permission to make changes...\"\"I know. The only person that can do that is Dr. Kwon.\"\"How many times do I need to tell you that he's now the chairman?\"\"Okay, chairman Kwon.\"\"Not only that, but the development of Asrian Online has finished. NFM is in charge of providing the service. So our only job is to do some small tasks like creating some patches. At this point, it's almost as if we were outsiders.\"It really was like that.The only reason they had the authority to monitor the users was to make sure that the world they had created was working properly.The problem was that Asrian was perfect. There weren't any issues with the game. But still, no one wished or was thinking about leaving the team.They all wanted to see how the virtual world they had created evolved on a different path from the earth.After all, they had put so many things in the process of creating Asrian Online.\"I know that we shouldn't call ourselves insiders anymore... I understand that...\"Mary murmured.Even though she understood her position, she had raised her voice so much because of her love for Asrian.They all felt the same way.Even though the big project had finished, they didn't want to return to their previous jobs. They had chosen to stay there.\"Let's just watch,\" Robert said with a bitter smile.The monitor changed and began showing the current number 1 player, 'Lattice.'After a long journey, this was their main form of entertainment.It still wasn't their turn to move.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 - The people that observe Hyun (2)\u201412:30 PMSeoHyun was participating in a high school reunion.There were two reasons why SeoHyun had gone there.The first one was to maintain some kind of human relationship.The second one was because he had heard that the reunion would take place in a fancy restaurant.'Anyway, Ain isn't going to log in until the afternoon.'He was also curious about how his high school friends, whom he hadn't seen since graduation day, were doing.There were ten people in total.Since he had gone to an all-boys high school, the first thing they talked about was video games.\"Hey, I also started playing a few days ago!\"\"What, Asrian?\"\"Yeah. I was impressed. Oof... I didn't sleep last night at all.\"\"More than a video game, it's a piece of art.\"Those days, the hottest topic in the video game industry is Asrian Online.Thanks to its cutting-edge sensory synchronization technology, it had successfully captured the interest and attention of all genders.Even middle-aged salarymen were interested in playing Asrian Online, so the sales of virtual reality capsules were booming. And all businesses related to virtual reality were experiencing an unprecedented increase in profits.\"If you're going to talk about video games, do it later! I have exams next week!\"\"Yeah, that's true. Today, let's talk about each other's school life. Even JaeHoon is here, so let's refrain from talking about video games.\"\"Hmm? I don't mind.\"JaeHoon, who had suddenly become the topic of the conversation, raised his head.He had always come on top of the scoring leaderboard during their high school years and finally got into Korea University\u2014he was the stereotypical model student.\"If you've played it even once, it's impossible not to talk about it. It's completely different from all the games that have come out before. This is real Virtual Reality.\"\"Yes, it really does feel like a video game that should've come out in the future.\"The topic of the conversation naturally flowed into Asrian Online.SeoHyun, who was quietly eating pasta in the corner, felt relieved. After all, the university he was going to was very bad compared to the ones his friends were attending.It was the natural result of playing Asra Online the day before the CSAT exams.\"Why did you start playing it right before the mid-term exams?\"\"I couldn't resist. Those that haven't started playing it shouldn\u2019t do it. That's it if you don't want to end up like me. When I came to my senses, I was already at level 48.\"\"Already? SeongJoon, you're amazing! Even among streamers, there aren't many people at that level.\"\"To tell you the truth, I'm also streaming.\"Even though he said it very carefully, one could notice the pride in his voice.\"Really?!\"\"Yeah, I'll send you the link. Come see my streams. I tend to have 2,000 viewers.\"\"2,000? When did you start streaming?\"\"One week ago... I'm also thinking of starting a YouTube channel.\"Everyone was impressed by SeongJoon's words. After all, online content making was one of the hottest industries.The number two most desired job by elementary school students was either a YouTuber or streamer.Everyone knew how impressive it was to have an audience of 2,000 people who regularly watched your streams, so they envied his success.\"Then, how much do you earn per month?\"\"I'm not sure since it hasn't been a month since I began streaming. But yesterday I earned $1,500.\"Everyone was impressed by what SeongJoon had just told them.During high school, he was one of the worst students. Yet, as soon as they came out to society, he was already earning a huge sum of money.\"Even if you ruin your mid-term exams, you're going to be okay. Just drop out of university and play Asrian.\"\"I think it would be best if I finished university just in case.\"\"That's true. But times have really changed, huh? Now you don't need to study to be successful.\"\"Damn, I should have focused on playing video games instead of studying during my high school years.\"\"Haha, even if you did that, it would be impossible for someone like you. SeongJoon has always been good at video games. That's why he was able to become a successful streamer!\"With streaming and Asrian Online as the main topics, the first high school reunion seemed to be reaching an end.'Should I start streaming? But I think no one would watch me since my job is Support...'Since SeoHyun was the typical outsider, he just stayed in the corner listening to what the popular guys were talking about.While everyone was saying their goodbyes\u2026\"SeoHyun, do you want to play together?\"'Huh?'When he turned around, he saw someone waving at him.Kim JaeHoon.He was one of the few people he talked to during his high school years.They weren't close friends, even though they had gone to the same middle and high school.He was someone who lived in a completely different world.Not only had he always received the best scores in his class, but he was also a student of Korea's most prestigious university.That JaeHoon had asked him something unexpected.\"Do you also play Asrian?\"He wasn't expecting someone like him to mention that word, Asrian.SeoHyun was surprised for a bit, but then he remembered that they had just been talking about Asrian Online at the reunion. So it was understandable that he was starting to get interested in it.\"Well, yes.\"\"I'm not surprised. After all, you've always enjoyed playing video games.\"JaeHoon smiled nervously.After pausing for a while, he finally spoke.\"I'm also playing Asrian Online.\"JaeHoon was hoping to see SeoHyun surprised.Just like he had planned, he was surprised but for a different reason.SeoHyun wasn't surprised even though he hadn't spoken anything about Asrian Online during the reunion.Gaming to relax when you're too stressed about your studies was a very common hobby, and maybe he just didn't want to mention he was also playing video games.\"I'm a level 41 warrior.\"\"Hmm... I see.\"\u2018Haha... I guess this surprised him for real. Huh...?\u2019JaeHoon was hoping to see an even more surprised expression, but he was the one that became embarrassed by his plain reaction.He had expected SeoHyun to be surprised to hear that he, a typical model student, was a level 41 warrior, but SeoHyun seemed as calm as if he was listening to the morning news.JaeHoon scratched his head.'If he has played Asrian, he should know how high level 41 is... But why isn't he showing any kind of reaction?'JaeHoon came to a false conclusion.\u2014\u2019This guy doesn't believe in what I'm saying!\u2019* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Well, it's a natural reaction. If a guy who seems like he's always studying came up to me and said he has a level 41 character out of nowhere, I wouldn't believe him either.He felt a little bit disappointed because he had been telling the truth.'Hmm... Is level 41 high...? It's a lot lower compared to SeongJoon. Damn it. I'm not sure if that's considered high or not! Is he trying to ask me for power leveling?'Contrary to Jae-hoon, who was disappointed, Seohyun was thinking about what Jae-hoon's true intentions were.That bragging hadn't worked on SeoHyun since his parameters were based on the people who were leading the ranking.'He won't easily believe me.'JaeHoon decided to move on.It wasn't like he was expecting praise or something like that. He was just looking to surprise a friend.\u2018Even though he won't believe in my words... I should say what I originally wanted to say.\u2019\u2018Although I'm sure he won't believe me.\u2019While thinking that, JaeHoon spoke to SeoHyun.\"My goal is to become a professional gamer.\"\"What?!\"That time, SeoHyun was really surprised.JaeHoon had said something totally unexpected.Why was someone who entered Korea University trying to become a pro-gamer?!SeoHyun wasn't the only one surprised. JaeHoon was also perplexed by his friend's reaction.'Wasn't it that he didn't trust my words...? Why did he suddenly make such a reaction...?'\"Really? You? becoming a pro-gamer?\"\"Do you believe me?\"\"Were you lying?\"\"No, everything I told you is the truth...\"\"Yes. There's no way you would tell such a lie out of the blue.\"\"...?\"JaeHoon seemed confused.The conversation seemed to be flowing in a strange direction, but he wasn't sure when the confusion had originated.Was he making fun of him?But looking at SeoHyun, he really seemed surprised by what he had just told him.It was an expression that wasn't fake.\"A pro-gamer? Amazing! But why are you suddenly telling me this?\"SeoHyun's voice awakened JaeHoon from his thoughts.Yes, there was something else more important.JaeHoon began talking about the reason why he had approached SeoHyun.\"Remember the game you always used to play?\"\"Yes...\"\"The name of that game was Asra Online, right?\"\"...!\"The moment the word 'Asra' came out, SeoHyun's eyes changed.JaeHoon gulped.SeoHyun's look had changed.This metaphor may sound weird, but he felt like an amateur who was about to play against a professional gamer.He couldn't find the old SeoHyun in the person standing in front of him\u2014that careless person who was always taking a nap was nowhere to be seen.\"Hmm... Asra Online... Yeah, I used to play it back then.\"In SeoHyun's smile, there was a mysterious sense of confidence.The SeoHyun standing in front of him wasn't that guy who didn't use to have a presence. He was an Asra gamer.JaeHoon thought that maybe the conversation could be unexpectedly prolonged.* * *The two moved somewhere else.When JaeHoon offered to buy him some coffee, he immediately followed him.But there was something strange\u2026The place where JaeHoon took him to, unlike normal cafes, had waiters that saluted you with a 90-degree bow.SeoHyun's steps stopped for a little while.'Just... How much money does this guy's family have?'The cafe looked like one of those places that appeared in movies.\u2018Is this the place that appeared on the news a few days ago because a cup of coffee costs $20?\u2019Even if he looked around, there were only couples on dates or salarymen dressed in suits. There wasn't a table with two university male university students.\"A table for two?\"\"Yes.\"\"Please follow me.\"SeoHyun, who was walking beside JaeHoon, had a slightly pale expression on his face.SeoHyun wondered what was important enough for JaeHoon to bring him to such a place.\u2018Considering that he had shown interest in Asra Online, he is likely after information about Asrian Online.\u2019\u2018He isn't going to threaten to not to pay for my coffee cup unless I give him useful information, right?\u2019After taking a seat and ordering, JaeHoon began talking.\"SeoHyun, how long did you play Asra Online?\"\"Hmm... Probably seven years, no\u2026 eight.\"JaeHoon was surprised by SeoHyun's answer.Eight years, that meant he had been playing Asra Online since he was in primary school.SeoHyun had more experience regarding Asra than he had initially thought.Those days, when the market is constantly being flooded with new games, it was weird to see someone who had played only one game for many years.\"You never took a break from it?\"\"Hmm... I once stopped playing for a month, but it was because I was very sick.\"\"In-incredible...\"JaeHoon felt overwhelmed by SeoHyun's experience in Asra Online. But soon, he came back to his senses.He decided to talk to him about the main topic.\"I'm going to be honest with you. 'Stardust' is looking for players with Asra Online experience.\"\"Stardust?\"\"It's the professional team I'm part of. I'm not an official member yet, but I'm going to sign on with them in the near future.\"Soon, the steak and pasta they had ordered came out.They continued their talk while eating.\"At first, our coach tried to get more information about Asra Online while playing. But soon, the service was canceled.\"Just like JaeHood said, a few weeks after Asrian Online came out, Asra Online's servers had shut down.Suddenly, there was no way to get information about Asrian Online while playing Asra.Not only that but with the page's closure, the official community of Asra Online was closed as well.That's why we're trying to find people who have played Asra Online in the past. We tried to post in online communities and tried to find them in real life by asking people we knew. But...\"SeoHyun felt pity for JaeHoon after seeing him shake his head while putting on an expression that showed how useless all his efforts had been.\"It's really hard to find Asra Online users...\"'Of course it's hard. It was a game with only 300 active users, after all!'Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 - Skill Combination (1)SeoHyun didn't say what he really felt.For some reason, he thought that would make him look more miserable.He wasn't proud of all the time he had spent to become the number one player of a game almost no one played.\"Do you want to eat cake?\"\"But it looks expensive.\"\"I'm paying, so don't worry about the price.\"They sat down and continued talking about Asrian.While talking, unexpectedly, SeoHyun felt relaxed and began having fun.Certainly, for boys, there wasn't a better topic of discussion than video games.He felt that the itchy sensation he had experienced during the reunion because of how much he wanted to talk about Asrian was being relieved.JaeHoon was also having fun. He was especially amazed by how many things SeoHyun knew about Asrian.\"A.. Are you really level 50?!\"\"Yes... Although my level is still low, I'm going to be leveling up pretty fast soon since I've recently completed my awakening quest and obtained an OP skill.\"\"Amazing... Wouldn't that put you on par with the top rankers?\"He finally understood why SeoHyun wasn't surprised by his level.SeoHyun seemed to be using his eight years of know-how to the full extent.In the eyes of those in the heavenly realm, there was almost no difference between the novice and intermediate players.JaeHoon, who had made up his mind, spoke to SeoHyun.\"In the beginning, I wanted you to join our team as one of the coaches and share information with us about Asra Online...\"\"Me... A coach?\"\"Yes, we're really in need of someone that knows about Asra Online... But after talking with you for a while, I've discovered something.\"\"What...?\"\"You are the type of person who would only be satisfied playing and doing things for yourself. Also, I think I asked you for a very difficult favor out of the blue.\"\"That may be true.\"\"SeoHyun, I just thought about this... But what do you think about becoming a professional gamer in our team?\"\"Professional gamer...?\"Since SeoHyun didn't seem to be having it, JaeHoon continued explaining.\"You don't need to get worried about finding a job, they support you in every way possible, and this is something only a few people know...\"JaeHoon lowered his tone of voice.\"It seems like they're planning to make Asrian an E-Sport. If this is true, it will become even bigger than it is now.\"\"E-Sport? But Asrian is a RPG Game.\"\"It seems like they're creating new content inside the game. I've heard this through someone I know, so I'm unsure about the details. But I'm sure that they're planning to add content that will allow users to compete with each other.\"\"Then...\"\"Yes. You'll be able to become an Asrian professional gamer!\"\"Hmm...\"SeoHyun thought about it carefully.Would the new competitive content be similar to the combat system?The format could be a 3 vs 3 or 5 vs 5.But the important thing was that the format would l probably be PvP.This news would make Ain excited.'I honestly enjoy fighting named monsters or clearing quests more than PvP...'However, this did not apply to SeoHyun.Getting a job that allowed you to earn money was tempting, but the merits of being a professional gamer would be small, in his opinion.'If I become a professional gamer, I won't be able to game freely as I do now.'\u2014That was the biggest reason.If he entered a professional gaming team, he would have to practice with his teammates. That would take time from playing normally.'I'll have a lot less time to play with Ain.'\u2014The Close Range Magician and Support.He wouldn't be able to use the skill combination that had taken him so much effort.Becoming a professional gamer would surely have its benefits, but SeoHyun believed he had more to lose than gain.'Also, it's not like I'm desperate for money.'If he was in need of money, he could always sell some gold for cash.Since SeoHyun preferred the in-game world over the real one, that would be something that he would do only as a last resort, but that meant that he would never die because of hunger.\"I'll think about it.\"\"Too bad, although I was expecting you to answer this.\"JaeHoon seemed slightly disappointed by the outcome, but he didn't seem to be in a bad mood.Rather than that, he replied with a smile on his face.\"I don't want to force my friend too much, but if you ever change your mind, please give me a call. Stardust would be excited to have someone with your experience join us.\"\"Yes, I'll give you a call if that happens.\"Hyun thought about it while replying.A friend...After finishing high school, he hadn't thought about JaeHoon, but he had fun talking about Asrian with the former number 1 student in his class.SeoHyun started to think that he would like to talk to him again.'Oh yeah!'Seohyun suddenly took out the pen next to the bill receipt and wrote something down.It was the strategy SeoHyun had been planning to use against a hidden named boss that was in the novice section.It was a quest that could only be done by users under level 50 that gave you experience.It was also a quest that had become useless for him because of the ghost hunting strategy.It was also to repay the expensive coffee he had bought for him.By using that quest, he should be able to gain an amount of experience equal to two days of farming.\"What?! Can you really give me information like this?\"After noticing what SeoHyun had written behind the receipt, JaeHoon felt burdened.\"I don't need it anymore.\"\"Even so... I feel like this is too much.\"\"Think about it as me repaying you for the coffee you've bought.\"JaeHoon hesitated for a long time but eventually accepted.As a gamer, he was also greedy.He seemed really moved by a quest that only gave you experience.\"SeoHyun, thank you. I'll pay you back for this, I promise.\"\"Don't worry about it. Just buy me dinner some other time.\"\"Of course, I'll invite you for dinner however many times it's necessary. I live around here, so call me anytime!\"Before parting ways, they exchanged numbers.It was the first number he exchanged after entering university.* * *The long-awaited awakening quest was cleared!After logging in to Asrian Online, Hyun checked out the details about his ultimate attack.[\u00abAssimilation\u00bb Lv.0]<Can you hear the resonance of the soul? Only those who have witnessed the bottom of the unconscious can truly communicate with the soul.>- You can assimilate with a target that's within 20 meters. (The target's consent is necessary!)- When the soul assimilates, you can manipulate the body together with the target.- 10% of your stats are added to the targets.- The main stat is increased by 50% of your [Empathy] stat.- The level of all the target's normal skills is increased by 1.- You can use the Support's skills during \u00abAssimilation\u00bb.<Cooldown Time: 0.1 seconds><Mana Required: 50>'Hmm... The skill by itself looks good.'\u00abAssimilation\u00bb was a skill that allowed you to control the body of someone together with that person.In short, it was like a host giving up access of their body to a parasite.He decided to think of it as a principle similar to that.'I'll have to test it out.'Hyun tried to test his ultimate attack, but there was one problem.To Assimilate, you needed the target's consent.If Ain were there, he would have asked her, but it wasn't time for her to log in yet.And he didn't feel comfortable asking another user since he needed to reveal his ultimate attack to do that.\"That you'll control my body? Don't talk nonsense! Get out of here!\"Asking the NPC mercenary soldiers resulted in him receiving insults. He was kicked out of the mercenary soldier's guild.He never imagined that getting the approval of a third party would be so hard!Hyun ended up paying ten silver coins and renting a golem.The moment you rented one of the Magic Country's golems, you received full authority over it, so he didn't need to get permission.The puppeteer explained it to him with a smile.\"It doesn't matter what you ask it to do within the three hours time limit, but once time passes and its magic empties, it will become soil again. So please be aware of that.\"He rented a one-time use golem.After using \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, Hyun's body became light and was absorbed by the golem.Hyun's soul was inside the small 50 centimeters golem.His shoulders felt unnatural when he tried to move the body's joints.'Status window.'Low-Ranking Stone Golem Lv.5 (The soul of 'Hyun' is assimilating!)HP: 170/170Mana: 50/50[Strength: 20(+65)] [Agility: 5(+5)] [Vitality: 15(+2)] [Magical Power: 0(+5)]Skills - <+Open List>- You can use the Support's skills.He saw the golem\u2019s information instead of his own when he opened the status window.The first thing he checked out were the stats.'What? Why does he have so much strength?'The level 5 golem, which was practically junk, had 85 strength.Since the main stat of the golem was strength, 50% of the Support's Empathy had been added to it.'It seems like the other stats have gone up too.'Paf- The moment he stopped the \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, Hyun appeared in the air.'So it's this kind of skill.'Hyun understood how his ultimate attack worked.There were three big advantages to \u00abAssimilation\u00bb.The first one was a stat increase.All stats increased by 10%, and on top of that, 50% of Empathy was added to the main stat.Its versatility was very high since it increased the main stat of the target.The second good point was control.Even if it was a junk golem with artificial intelligence, if he could control it, he should be able to deal a great amount of damage with it.The third benefit was safety.The Support was a job that was prone to becoming an opponent's target.But if he could hide inside the body of a damage dealer or tanker, no one would be able to attack him.Basically, \u00abAssimilation\u00bb worked both as a very effective supporting skill and a way to defend himself.'Good. I've learned how the skill works. Should I hunt until Ain logs in?'Hyun left the 10 silver, low-ranking golem in the streets and went to see the puppeteer.In order to hunt comfortably, he'd need a better doll.'Yes, that one looks good.'The doll Hyun had gotten by spending 50 gold was a one-meter tall lame doll called 'Acrobat.'\"Oh, did the golem break already? It will also disappear if it dies or the magic given to it runs out, so you don't need to return it. But please, be careful.\"\"I'll be more careful, thanks.\"As soon as he left the shop\u2026Hyun assimilated into the clown-shaped doll holding a dagger with both hands.Once again, his body turned into light dust, then the eyes of the doll began to shine.Red Acrobat Lv.55 (The soul of 'Hyun' is assimilating.)HP: 660/660Mana: 100/100[Strength: 10] [Agility: 15(+70)] [Vitality: 10(+2)] [Magical Power: 5(+5)]<Skill List>[\u00abFatal Blow\u00bb Lv.0(+1)] - Deal x13 damage to opponents with less than 5 stat points in defense.[\u00abOpen Wound\u00bb Lv.0(+1)] - Each time you land a successful consecutive attack, the damage increases by 10%. (13 times maximum!)Hyun smiled creepily while playing with the two-handed sword in his hands.By combining the doll's slanted eyes with his own, his appearance resembled that of a doll that appeared in horror movies.'It looks good.'The Red Acrobat had a unique characteristic compared to normal users or NPCs.\u2014The balance was solely focused on the skills.Since you couldn't equip the doll with items, you could find ones that had unique and strong skills from time to time.Hyun was thinking of exploiting that characteristic.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 - Skill Combination (2)Clatter- Clatter-A creepy-looking doll was walking fast while limping.The agility of the doll, which was 15 at base, had gone up to 85 once Hyun assimilated into it.Normally, the amount of damage each job dealt was based on its main stat.Just by using \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, the average damage had gone up nearly six times.\"Hehe, I've been saving up skill points for this day.\"Hyun had no intention of being satisfied with just that.He had saved up so many skill points to create the best possible synergy between his skills and the ultimate attack.As a result of checking out the Support's skill list, Hyun discovered one that combined well with his ultimate attack.Without thinking about it twice, he spent 20 skill points on it.[\u00abPowerless Wave\u00bb Lv.2]- Surround yourself with a wave two meters in length. Reduce the defense of all opponents touched by it by [Empathy] x 2.- Duration: 10 minutes.<Mana Required: 90>Hyun had 130 Empathy.He could reduce an opponent\u2019s defenses by 260.Unless it was a level 200 or 300 boss, there were no enemies with so much defense. That meant that it made the defense of most enemies 0.'It works very well with \u00abAssimilation\u00bb.'Usually, a Support had to take a considerable risk to get within two meters of the enemies because of the low HP it had.But by using it in combination with \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, you could debuff all enemies around yourself just by standing still.'I guess this much preparation is okay.'Hyun purposely looked for areas that had monsters with high defense.The habitat of giant rock crabs.The monsters that appeared there had a very high defense, so even a level 50 warrior couldn't leave a scratch on their surface, which was as hard as steel.Not only that, but since it also had a very high defense against magical attacks, there were almost no parties that hunted there.From time to time, there were Magicians or Priests that went there for solo playing. But even those kinds of players could rarely be seen.'There's no one.'After looking around, he immediately charged toward the monsters.\u00abPowerless Wave\u00bb!Paf-The moment he activated the newly learned skill, he began to swing a sword as small as a toy, but the results it produced were no joke.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 2182 damage!]It was an amazing amount of damage, considering that it had come from a normal attack!Whir-!It began to spread slowly from the body of the Acrobat in all directions.It was the effect of \u00abPowerless Wave\u00bb, a skill Hyun had used after using \u00abAssimilation\u00bb.The defense of all enemies touched by the wave was at 0, so their strong armor had no purpose.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 2284 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 2556 damage!]Also, the more he attacked, the more damage he dealt!Thit was thanks to the Acrobat's passive skill.Hyun had chosen the Acrobat among all the other dolls because it had the best possible synergy with his \u00abAssimilation\u00bb skill.'Isn't this amount of damage better than what an average party can do? Still, it isn't as high compared to the Close Range Magician's attack.'Hyun charged toward a group of stone crabs once more.Smash- Smash-As he swung the two-handed sword, he began cutting the shells of the monsters as if they were tofu.The sensation he received from his weapon was that he was cutting water.On the face of the Acrobat, a creepy smile appeared.It was Hyun's smile leaking out.\"Yes, it's this sensation!\"Every time he slashed the enemies, defeated them, and obtained EXP, he felt the sorrow of everything he had gone through as a Support was being washed away.It had been a while since he felt the excitement of being a damage dealer!Of course, he had gotten used to the playstyle of a Support, but he missed his previous playstyle.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 4702 damage!]Sometimes, a giant stone crab shouted and turned into light dust after just one hit.It was a side effect of receiving more than 33% of damage.Thanks to the passive of the Red Acrobat\u2019s \u00abOpen Wound\u00bb, the damage he dealt had increased by 130%.Hyun kept moving forward while his hands moved constantly.Every time the sword shone, the opponent's shell and claws were split and scattered through the air.'I can go a little bit deeper.'After hunting for a while, Hyun moved to the next area.Judging by the darker color, those monsters probably had a higher level.Even though they looked very similar, their specs were better.The biggest difference was that they had more defense, but that wasn't really a problem for Hyun.Whoosh-The moment the two-meter aura touched the opponents, their defense was decreased by two times Hyun's [Empathy] stat.The only strong point of those monsters was their high defense.But the moment the Support's skill touched them, their defense went to 0 instantly.There wasn't much difference between fighting them and the slimes around starter town.[Level up!]It had been half an hour since he began hunting.A light came out from the body of the Red Acrobat.'Oof... Good.'Endlessly hunting opponents that were strong on the outside but slow could be fun at first. But as time went on, it started to get boring.The level-up news, which came once in a while, was what motivated Hyun to keep doing that repetitive and boring hunting.'Should I hunt the field boss?'Hyun entered a little bit deeper.After walking for a few minutes, he saw a 3-meter tall stone crab inside of the canyon.\u2014King Lashir.It was a level 70 named monster.Usually, he wouldn't have dared to hunt it alone, but because he had rented that doll's body, he felt that he would be able to beat it.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 190 damage!]Hyun became surprised after slashing its shell.'I was able to damage it?'The boss had used a skill that increased its defense three times and, at the same time, reduced the incoming damage by 1/10 of the total.If the boss curled up, most users under level 100 weren't able to deal any damage to it.\u2014But Hyun had clearly dealt a three-digit damage number to it.'Don't tell me...'The reason why he was able to deal damage, despite his attack being reduced to 1/10 of the total, was because Hyun's \u00abPowerless Wave\u00bb was having an effect.'It was able to cut the boss's defense down to zero?'The skill didn't have a detailed explanation, so he wasn't 100% sure, but it seemed like the debuff even worked on boss monsters.In Asra and Asrian, there were almost no skills that modified the monster's defense.It was the same for users and NPCs.Some skills increased or decreased the defense by a certain %, but skills that modified the defense by an absolute value were quite rare.But he already had two skills that modified the opponent's defense.\u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb, \u00abPowerless Wave\u00bb.That reminded him of the fact that Support was a hidden job class.'This is no joke!'Whish- Whish-The Acrobat's short sword cut through the weak flesh of the rock-type boss.While crying out loud, it used numerous special moves, but because he had successfully neutralized its defense, it was all pointless.Boom-\u00a0It took only a few minutes for king Lashir to fall.[Level up!]The boss that had died dropped only one item.He didn't see any new achievement message, which meant he wasn't the first to defeat it.He decided not to hold onto it since it didn't give stats points as an achievement.As he left the area, the doll disappeared since its time had run out. And naturally, the \u00abAssimilation\u00bb was canceled.\"Hmm... So in three hours, I've leveled up two times.\"Hyun seemed satisfied with the results.Since the rock-type monsters had a lot of defense, they gave a lot of experience.If he stayed in that place for an entire day, he would probably be able to level up 10 times at a minimum.'But the cost of renting a doll is too high.'The problem was that renting a high-quality doll like the Red Acrobat cost 50 gold for every three hours.It wasn't like he didn't make money back, but if he kept spending 50 gold, it would eventually become a fortune.'Well, I guess it's okay to use it only when Ain isn't here.'He was sure that \u00abAssimilation\u00bb would work the best while using Ain's body.Hyun looked at the time that appeared on the bottom of the system.Soon, Ain would log in.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\"Is it here?\"\"Yeah. It looks like we're in the right place.\"They were at the entrance of enormous old ruins.A giant ice golem was solemnly standing in front of it.It was a level 150 mid-sized monster.It wasn't an opponent that level 50 users could fight against and win.Even if Hyun were self-confident in his skills, he wouldn't dare fight against it recklessly.If that were their former selves, they wouldn't be able to do it.But they had completed their respective awakening skills and obtained an ultimate attack.\"All right, let's break it.\"After saying that, Hyun activated his ultimate attack. He instantly became light dust and scattered away.Hyun and Ain.Incredibly, they had become one person.Her outer appearance looked the same as usual, but inside her, there was Hyun.When Hyun extended and raised his hands, Ain's hands went up.\u300cThis still amazes me.\u300dTwo people controlling a character was a setup that had been previously seen in other games, but Asrian was a cutting-edge virtual reality game.\u300cI know, right?\u300dAin was excited at the thought that he could share senses with Hyun.It was the perfect chance to see Hyun's movements from a first-person perspective.From some point onward, she couldn't keep up with Hyun.Ain always said that she was better in PvP, but the main advantage she had was that she was better than him in psychological warfare. She was in no way overwhelmingly stronger than him.But in many vs one, many vs. many, named monsters, dungeons, etc... In all areas except dueling, he was better than her.The reason why she began to have an interest in him was that he was better than her in almost everything.Maybe she could finally learn the secrets to catch up to him with this skill.While Ain had a lot of expectations, Hyun was dealing with a weird sensation.Sharing the body of someone of the opposite gender was weird.In the first place, the body structure was different.Hyun wanted to put his hands on his chest but stopped.At that moment, Ain saw Hyun's hands and laughed slyly.\"Fufu... What was that? Did you want to touch my body so much?\"Hyun felt flustered by what Ain had just said.From time to time, Ain used to say embarrassing words.While pretending to be okay, Hyun replied to Ain.\u300cDon't push yourself too hard.\u300d\"W-what...?\"\u300cYou always make jokes like this but become shy soon after telling it and then stay quiet.\u300d\"Th-that's not true.\"\u300cWhat...?\u300dHyun suddenly felt his, no Ain's arm going up by itself.At that moment, he felt something in the palm of his hands.There was a sudden pause.But since there wasn't a mirror, he couldn't see Ain's expression.Hyun asked something he had been wondering about.Maybe he was imagining things.He couldn't help but ask a question just in case.Maybe he was imagining things\u2026\u300cAin, do you like me?\u300d\"W... What are you talking about?!\"\u300cIt's... Just that I wanted to hear your thoughts.\u300d\"Oh, hmm...\"Fwoosh- Instead of answering, her whole body got wrapped by a fire, and the flames covered her face.Hyun's breathing became faster, and he could feel his heartbeat speed up.No, since he was in Ain's body, was that the state of her body?Since he was using \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, they were having a hard time distinguishing each other's bodies.'Damn it... This is all because she suddenly did something weird...!'Hyun tried to calm down.He tried to focus on the main goal. He tried to concentrate on the opponent that was in front of them.Fwoosh-\u2014A technique that covers the whole body with fire.Yes, that was the Awakening Skill she had obtained.[\u00abPrepared for Extinction\u00bb Lv.0]<The will of those ready to die is the strongest! The wind has heard you, so cover your body with flames.>- You take the appearance of a wolf.- Your HP gets drained little by little while you're maintaining the form of a wolf.- While you're converted into a wolf, you can't recover HP with an ally's skill!- All fire-type attacks deal three times more damage!- All the levels of fire-type skills are increased by 1 level!- If it isn't forced to cancel, it can last for an hour at maximum.<Cooldown Time: 24 hours>Fwoosh- Fwoosh-Ears made of fire appeared on top of the head.When he looked around, he saw a tail.Because Ain was so small, she looked like a fox rather than a wolf. But she seemed satisfied with the result.They took a step forward.Ain didn't seem to have the intention to move. So she gave control of it to Hyun.Crack- As soon as he thought about the skill, giant, hot claws came out.[\u00abEfret's Claw\u00bb Lv.5 (+2)]- The flame condenses and evolves into a giant set of claws.- Apply [Magical Power]x7 as damage.- Spend 15 mana per second.A level 7 skill!Thanks to the skill level going up because of the ultimate attack, Ain's fire claws had evolved.Now that she had a set of giant claws, she began looking like a real wolf.It was the same skill that the shadows on the fifth floor had used against them.Hyun wondered how much damage they would be able to deal.'I guess I'll find the answer once I hit it.'He jumped over the golem and used the claws to scratch its surface.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 15485 damage!][You've dealt 8805 damage!]'...?'Hyun started to think that he was imagining things.The reason was the unbelievably high amount of damage.'Is the damage bugged?'The damage couldn't be compared to the damage they did in the awakening quests, in which they received a lot of bonus stats.Rather than being based on boosted event stats, it used the normal stats to calculate the damage.Hyun had never imagined seeing damage so high that even a level 250 user couldn't easily do.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 - A Suspicious Old Man's Commission (1)After doing some calculations in his mind, he finally understood what had happened.'It's probably because of the Support's new skill I learned. It can even turn the defense of a strong guy like this to zero.'Swoosh- He jumped up and smacked the head of the giant ice golem.While falling to the ground, he kept attacking the golem's body.[Critical Hit!

Is this okay in terms of balance...?\u300dIt didn't take him long to defeat the golem.As soon as he stopped the ultimate attack, the fire disappeared instantly.The giant claws also became normal-sized flames because the +1 of the skill level that the ultimate attack gave had disappeared.Because of the side effect of Ain's ultimate attack, she had lost some HP, but except for that, Hyun thought that there wouldn't be any problems.At that moment\u2026Clap Clap Clap-\u00a0As they defeated the golem, they heard someone clapping.When he turned his head around, he saw an old man smiling mischievously from the inside of the ruins.\"Amazing, I can't believe you've defeated my kid.\"An old man with white hair had suddenly appeared in front of Hyun and Ain.The fact he had called the golem 'my kid' meant that he was its owner.But in his eyes, there weren't any signs of anger.In fact, he seemed happy.\"Hahaha... Just as expected, this guy was big, but it wasn't trustworthy... But I think you guys will be able to handle the job. What do you say? I'll, of course, give you a proper reward.\"Ring-!<Hidden Quest: A suspicious old man's commission> <Difficulty: ???>- An old man whose identity is unknown is trying to commission suspicious work from you. Judging by his looks, he doesn't seem like a good person... But he will probably keep the promise of rewarding you... Probably?( \u203b Warning: You won't be able to check the quest details before accepting it!)A window appeared in front of Hyun and Ain.Hidden quest!Even in the Asrian online boards, only once a week, a thread appeared on the trending topics saying that they'd found a hidden quest. It truly was that rare.The users were desperate to find hidden quests since the rewards they gave were better than the normal ones.'As expected, he gives a hidden quest.'But all of that did not apply to Hyun.'This will probably be the only chance we get to do this quest.'Since in Asrian, things happened based on time, there were quests that you wouldn't be able to complete once the time had passed.The old man's quest was one of those.Also, the old man's quest was a key part of the flow of the story.But what Hyun was after was the reward he gave for completing the quest!He definitely needed to have that reward in his hands since it would give him a great advantage over the rest of the players.It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that everything he had done up until then was in preparation for that day.\"What do you say? I'm sure you'll be satisfied with the reward.\"\"We'll do it.\"Hyun answered without doubting for a second.\"Hmm... You're a bold one, huh? I like that. My commission isn't something grand, so don't worry.\"Ring-.[The quest's mission has been unveiled!]\"You just need to protect the gate of this temple. You also don't need to be here for the entire day.\"The old man pointed toward the sky.The night sky of AsrianIt was as beautiful as starlight embroidered on jet-black silk in the night sky of Asrian.The night sky of Asrian was as beautiful as if the sky was pitch-black silk over which stars had been embroidered.And in the middle of it, there was a full moon shining!No, it wasn't a full moon. It was 'Gluna,' Asrian's satellite.The Gluna that could be seen at night shone more intensely than Earth's moon.\"You need to fight all the intruders trying to come to this place for just an hour from midnight when the moon rises to the top. The time limit is four days.\"\"But this isn't a place where someone would come... What happens if nobody appears?\" Ain asked with a sharp tone of voice.The old man began laughing.\"Then you'll get the rewards without doing anything. I'll give you a new reward at the end of each day. How about that? Isn't this a fair deal?\"\"There's something suspicious...\"\"Haha... Maybe it is because you're a fire magician, but you seem to be a very suspicious person. I promise you that there are no lies in my words.

Before we met in Asrian Online, I thought you were a boy.\"While they were chit-chatting, the quest began.Swoosh-A pillar of light rose from the center of the temple to the sky.The pillar of light seemed to face the sky head-on.It emitted a strong but not ominous feeling. It also wasn't destructive.Rather than that, the lights that were ascending to the sky felt holy.\"It looks like a laser show.\"Hyun couldn't answer Ain's honest impression.For Hyun, who had focused all his life on gaming, seeing things like laser shows was something only the popular people did.'It reminds me of the ultimate attack the shadows of the fifth floor used during the awakening quest.'Hyun's impression of it was limited to recent Asrian events.If you took out the dazzling and destructive nature from the ultimate attack, they really looked like the light pillars.Hyun was standing in front of the entrance of the ruins.The old man had asked him to guard the door. But as time went on, no one appeared.Since just standing was boring, he chit-talked with Ain.By how often she yawned, Ain also seemed bored of just standing still while waiting for something to happen.\"...\"The time went on. However, no one had come even though the quest was about to end.In the first place, was there anyone capable of discovering those ruins that were in the middle of this desolate mountain?\"It's kind of boring standing still while doing nothing. Do you want to do something else to kill some time?\"\"Let's wait for a little bit more. After all, he said that our job was to protect this place...\"That was how an hour passed without Hyun and Ain doing anything.The light pillars that were connected to the Gluna disappeared, and pitch-black darkness covered the sky again.From the insides of the ruins, the old man came out while looking around with a satisfied expression.\"It seems like there wasn't any intruder... Haha. Anyway, I'll reward you because I don't break a promise. So what should I give you? Oh, this one should be good! I'll awaken your potential. I'll reward you with what you call skill points.\"After saying that, he smiled mischievously.\"Unfortunately, since I lack strength, I can reward only one of you. Who is going to receive it?\"[As a reward for completing the quest, you can obtain +2 skill points!][But only one between 'Hyun' and 'Ain' can receive the reward!]Hyun and Ain hesitated for a moment.Only one of them was going to receive a reward. Even for veterans of Asra Online like them, it was the first time seeing something like that.But the doubt was short-lived. The decision was made quickly.\"Hyun, receive it. I don't need more skill points.\"\"Really?! Are you sure?\"\"You want to learn the skill \u00abVision Sword\u00bb, right? It looks like you still weren't able to learn it yet because you're missing some skill points.\"\"That's true, but...\"\"If you feel sorry... L-Listen to one request of mine in the future.\"\"Why are you stuttering? Just what kind of request are you planning to make?\"The old man didn't seem satisfied by how easily they decided who would take the skill points.\"Hmm... Both of you have a lot of camaraderie...\"Even though he wasn't happy with the result, the old man gave the promised reward.He placed his hands on Hyun's shoulders and cast a short spell. A white light entered his body.[You've obtained 2 skill points!]\"Then I'll see you again tomorrow before midnight. I'll have some good rewards prepared.\"After saying that, the old man entered the ruin and disappeared from sight.Hyun was thinking of following the old man to the insides of the ruin, but he decided not to.'I mustn't break the warning not to go in yet.'The hidden quest would take place for a total of four days, and the first one had just finished.He was excited at the thought of what would happen on the last day.* * *Ganesha City.It was a mid-sized city that had 10,000 habitants.Nevertheless, it was always crowded around the bulletin board where various quest requests were attached.\"Huh... What's this?\"Salon, an average Asrian user, was checking out the quests on the bulletin board.While thinking about what quest he should do that day, a particular one caught his attention.\"Is this real?\"Every user wanted to do a quest that offered an optimal reward for their effort, so Salon was very serious about choosing the right one.But the moment he saw the details of the quest that was on top of the bulletin board, his eyes opened wide.The reason was that the rewards it gave couldn't be compared to the rest.<Count Allan's Request>- Yesterday, around midnight, a villager said that he saw a suspicious light coming out from the Calafer mountain.By talking with my magician, I've concluded that there's a slight risk of it being dangerous.I'll award 1000 gold to the party that finds out what that light pillar was.<Reward: 1000 gold, 20000 experience. (In case a party fulfills the quest, the points will be distributed evenly)><Limit: Lv.30>Salon was surprised by the generous rewards.\"A quest that only requires you to investigate offers 1000 gold and 20000 experience points?!\"He, a level 46 Thief, had been fighting against the temptation of getting a better weapon. He had been fighting with a weapon destined for citizens bought in a shop.The amount of money he had saved by doing that was only 1500 gold.But a simple quest offered almost as much money as he had saved up.Not only that. But the amount of experience it gave was a lot too.\"20,000!\"If Salon gained 20,000 experience, he would surely level up.Normally, that would take him two or three days of hunting, but that huge amount of experience could be obtained in just an instant.He had never seen a quest that offered so many rewards for the amount of effort required to complete it.Salon was soon blinded by greed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 - A Suspicious Old Man's Commission (2)'Should I try to beat this quest alone?'Salon had teammates who had been with him for quite some time.It was a party with a good balance. It had all four jobs: Warrior, Magician, Thief, and Priest.If he completed the quest with his party, the reward would be 250 gold and 5000 experience... But what if he did it alone?It seemed like no one had noticed the existence of that quest yet.The moment he accepted the quest, it would be automatically deleted from the bulletin board, and no one would get to know about its existence.Should he do it by himself?'No, I can't do that.'For a moment, greed took control over him, but after a while, he shook his head.The bond between the party members, with whom he'd been together with since they were rookies, was strong.He felt relieved after deciding not to betray his allies.'Accept Quest.'Salon accepted the quest without telling anyone.The quest was erased from the bulletin board when he accepted it.Since members of the same party could share quests with each other later, it was standard to accept important quests in advance.'Haha, I wonder how they will react after seeing this quest. What if they began following me?'Salon's steps lightened while imagining that.* * *\u2014A few hours later.Salon's party was going up the Calafer mountain.That place was the destination of the quest Salon had shared.The moment he had shared the quest details with the party members, they were all very surprised.They had never seen a quest that offered such generous rewards.\"I can't believe that a simple request for research offers such rewards!\"The Priest, Merica, still looked puzzled.The Calafer mountain was a hunting ground that users had already widely investigated.One couldn't help but think that offering gold and experience for investigating a map that was already public was probably an error.But if it wasn't an error, it meant that Salon had discovered an incredible quest.\"I honestly think that Salon deserves a bigger cut,\" said 'Extreme Tanker,' the leader of the party.\"Since the experience is auto awarded by the system, we can't do anything about it, but that's not the case with the gold. I think Salon deserves at least 500 gold.\"\"No, I've already told you I don't mind sharing it evenly!\"\"I also think the same. Mr. Salon deserves a bigger cut. If it were me, I'd have done it by myself without telling anyone.\"\"Hahaha, I would've done the same.\"The other two party members, Merica and Dalph, said so while laughing.\"Take more. I'm okay with 150 gold. But to tell you the truth, I don't think I even deserve this.\"\"I'm also okay with 150 gold.\"\"Hehe, me too. Mr. Salon, please take the rest.\"\"You guys...\"Salon was so moved that he was about to cry.When the other party members saw him tear up, they began bothering him with that.Because Asrian Online could replicate human emotions so well, it was hard to hide one's feelings.As the hours passed, night came to the world of Asrian.According to the contents of the quest, the 'suspicious light' appeared around midnight.The moment it became midnight, Salon's party saw a pillar of light rising as if it were a volcano exploding.\u2014Their worries about the light being weak and having trouble finding it turned out to be pointless.\"Over there!\"\"If we move while hunting monsters, we'll get there in about 20 minutes!\"\"Hehe, this is getting interesting.\"The party began moving to investigate the light.According to the content of the quest, they had to reach the middle of the mountain before the light disappeared.Since the level of the monsters of the Calafer mountain was around 30~40, there probably wouldn't be any difficulties in completing the quest.\"Since it's bright, we don't have to be afraid of getting lost. Isn't this too easy?\"\"Yes. We don't even need to use light magic to illuminate the path.\"The night in Asrian was a lot brighter than in the real world.That was because 'Gluna' was a lot brighter than Earth's Moon.Despite that, most parties, including Salon's, used light magic to illuminate the area while fighting during the night.But thanks to the giant pillar of light, they would be able to save Mana that day.\"Just what is that bright thing?\"\"Well, discovering that is the goal of our quest.\"\"A phenomenon that's as eye-catching as that looks a little bit dangerous indeed.\"\"Since our job is to investigate, we don't need to face the danger. Right?\"The party advanced smoothly while defeating monsters.As they walked through a narrow canyon, old ruins appeared.The light seemed to come from somewhere inside the ruins.And someone stood in front of the ruins.There was a shadow blocking the way of the users.They couldn't see its face since it was wearing a black robe.Also, because of the giant light pillar that was behind it, the figure looked darker.\"Everyone, stop. Is that a monster?\"\"No, it seems to be a person.\"Extreme Tanker took the lead.He slowly approached the unknown person without letting his guard down.An enemy? An ally?Even if it is an enemy, there may be room for negotiation if it was a humanoid NPC.They would be able to ask the figure to move away.But all those expectations soon crumbled.\"You cannot pass.\"Extreme Tanker realized that the voice owner was a woman after hearing a husky but young voice.\"If I ask you to go back... Will you do it?\"The girl asked while pointing to the path that was behind the party.Before Extreme Tanker could answer her, she replied to her own question.\"That won't happen, right?\"Had he imagined the joy in her voice?It seemed as if she was waiting for them to come.Such appreciation was brief. The party was forced to come to its senses.The girl, whose hands were covered in fire, was charging toward them.\"Everyone, be careful! Prepare for battle!\"Extreme Tanker took out his shield while shouting to his allies.He stood in front of the party and applied all his defensive skills to himself.At first, one might think that applying so many buffs in preparation for an unknown attack was too much, but it wasn't.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Slam![You've received 1102 damage!][You've received damage that's more than 33% of your HP at once!][Because of severe burn, your left arm has become paralyzed!]\"What...!\"Extreme Tanker couldn't understand what had just happened.The girl had stretched out her arms, changed the attack's trajectory, and managed to touch the other side of the shield.The amount of damage dealt by that simple attack was absurd.'More than a thousand of damage...?!'As the party's main tanker, he had spent most of his stat points in vitality. He was also wearing full-body plate armor, even though that made him lose mobility.He had also learned a skill that reduced the damage received by a certain %.All his efforts had made him the best possible main tanker.The incident when he didn't die even while fighting against 20 wolves was very famous. They frequently talked about it when they were hanging out.The situation didn't feel real because of how prideful Extreme Tanker was.'I can't move my arms...!'He couldn't control the arm that was holding the shield.\"Save the leader!\"The rest of the party began moving to save their friend who was in danger.Salon had successfully managed to reach the girl's back using the Thief's skill.He used the poisoned dagger to stab her back.\u2014Or that's what he thought.The girl twisted her body a little bit. The dagger ended up stabbing the air, and the attack resulted in a fail.'She dodged it...?!'She had managed to dodge a surprise attack aimed at the rear.Salon was sure that he had aimed at the correct place, but the girl in front of him had dodged his attack very easily.No, maybe he had aimed at the wrong place from the beginning.Those were his last thoughts.The claws that had cut Salon's neck melted the entire body.[You've died!][You'll be able to log in again in 48 hours!]\"Salon-!\" Shouted Extreme Tanker while watching his friend die.Salon had sacrificed his own personal gain for the benefit of the party, and then he had died while trying to save him.They were in the worst situation possible!One had died, and another one was in a moribund state!As for the Priest, who hadn't been able to change jobs, the only thing that she could do was to fill Extreme Tanker's HP. She couldn't release him from his abnormal status.\"Ugh... Don't worry about me; protect Dalph!\"The party still had one last hope.Even as everyone was becoming incapable of fighting, the only Magician in the group was about to finish the long spell he had been casting.But Dalph was starting to feel restless.'There's no way, right? No, it can't be...'\u2014Black robes.\u2014Small body.\u2014Fire covering both hands.Dalph remembered watching a YouTube video of someone very similar to her that gave him goosebumps.Somehow, he felt like the movements of the girl in front of him overlapped with the ones of the girl that appeared in that video.'Calm down... There's no way she'd be in this place. Right?'As a result of calming down and finishing casting, he was able to use the strongest magic he knew.\u00abMana Bullets\u00bb!Bang Bang Bang-!Five golden arrows came out from Dalph\u2019s wand.The fact that, despite having a long casting time, it was a single target attack rather than an AOE meant that the amount of damage it dealt was that much higher!The five magic bullets flew across the air and straked toward the girl's body.At that moment, the girl's hand shone and stirred with Mana.\"H... How did she do that?!\"What just happened was enough to take out the breath of the party members.The girl had just brushed off the magic bullets that were so fast that they couldn't be seen.Seeing how easily she dealt with Dalph's skill, the party fell into silence.'She's...'Dalph suddenly came back to his senses.He was convinced.'That person! We can't win against her...!'He wasn't wrong.After brushing off all Ralph's attacks, she got in front of him with just one leap; then, with both hands covered in fire, she smashed him.[You've died!]Once Dalph was also forcibly logged out, Extreme Tanker began to panic. There were only two people left: Himself and Merica, the Priest.No, in just an instant, she had gotten rid of Extreme Tanker, so only Merica was still alive.\"Just how...\"Merica still couldn't believe that the figure had completely destroyed her party.She soon began to panic.Because she was having trouble maintaining balance, she looked down. Her legs were shaking in fear.It was a game, so she couldn't understand why she was feeling such a realistic fear.The reason was actually very simple: the game, through the capsule, sent brain waves according to the situation the user was going through. But at that moment, Merica couldn't think so deeply.\"Ugh...\"The girl had just murdered three users and was walking toward her in order to finish the job.After looking closely at the face behind the robe, she saw a devilish smile.That girl was smiling while killing people.The girl was definitely a psychopath.\"Ugh...!\"From the first moment Merica saw her, she began wondering about something.Was the opponent an NPC or a user...? Common sense would say that she was clearly an NPC, but Merica hadn't been sure up until then.But then, she was sure.\u2014There was no way she was a user!A normal person that lives in a modern society wouldn't make such a creepy smile while killing people!After a few seconds, Merica ended up following her friends.[You've died!][You'll be able to log in again in 48 hours!]* * *That day\u2019s quest had also ended.After the time was over, the light disappeared. Hyun left Ain's body.\"You... Seemed happy after doing some PvP for the first time in quite some time.\"Hyun looked at Ain, who couldn't hide her smile as if she were a kid with a confused look on thier face.It seemed like she still enjoyed dueling against users more than hunting.Back then, he remembered being troubled by her constant challenges to duel.\"Those guys were weak. What's so fun about defeating people like that?\"\"Then can you be my duel partner?\" Ain asked why turning around.Hyun opened his mouth before something happened.\"Hmm... That wasn't a bad party at all. The moment the tanker was in danger, the rest of the party moved fast... Also, their character control was decent enough.\"The Tanker had resisted quite well.In that short amount of time, the Thief had managed to mix some feints into the surprise attack. The Magician also seemed to have good skills overall.Hyun tried to inflate their strong points as much as possible and elevate the level of the party.\"But everything you've mentioned is stuff they should do either way.\"\"Th... That's true, but...\"\"Well, if Hyun says so, let's leave it like that.\"Ain seemed in a good mood. She just kept smiling.It seemed like she wouldn't get angry at him no matter what he did.Being alone with Ain in an old ruin illuminated by the moonlight made Hyun feel something.It was as if they were on a date.After thinking nonsensical things like that, Hyun began to move.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 - A Suspicious Old Man's Commission (3)\"Haha... You've done a great job today as well.\"The old man's voice cut into Hyun's thoughts.He mumbled while watching the remnants of the day\u2019s fight.\"It seems like people tried to infiltrate today. I'm relieved you were able to stop them. Well, I've brought a rare item that can be rarely seen.\"Haha.\u00a0The old man so said while laughing unpleasantly.\"But since it's something so rare, I only have one. It saddens me to say this, but I can give this to only one person.\"After saying that, the old man took out a bottle.Inside the bottle, a blue liquid moved.Every time the liquid moved inside the bottle, a small electric current spread.Through the system window, Hyun discovered what that liquid was.[<Weak Heaven's Elixir (Copy)>]- It has a mysterious power that amplifies your potential if you drink it.- Since it's a copy, the effect is weak compared to the real one.- The increase in your potential lasts for one hour.[HP] +20,000[Mana] Increase the recovery time of your Mana by 10 times.Hyun's eyes widened after reading the description.\"Woah, a Heaven's Elixir?\"\"Hmm? How did you know what this is...?\"The old man seemed shocked at first but soon came to a conclusion while nodding.\"I guess discovering the name of an item is easy for a user. I was wrong.\"Hyun wasn't interested in what the old man was mumbling about.The effects of Heaven's Elixir were quite noticeable, making it very desirable.'This was hard to get even in Asra Online...'Heaven's Elixir.It was a potion that temporarily increased your HP and Mana.The word 'weak' in front of the name bothered him a little bit.He guessed that the old man had made a copy of the original.That was probably why it was so weak compared to the original Hyun remembered. But it was still quite good.Especially for someone like Ain, who used a lot of Mana and didn't have a lot of HP, an extra 20,000 points were a lot.\"Ain, I think you should keep this.\"\"Me?\"\"I have \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, so it doesn't matter.\"That's how it was decided that Ain would keep the Heaven's Elixir.The old man seemed bothered again by how quickly they decided who would keep the reward.\"Ahem... Anyway, that was it for today. The next reward will be something both of you will covet.\"* * *After the attendance check-in was over, Hyun escaped from classes.He was on his way to see a friend with whom he had gotten closer recently.He was about to see his former high-school classmate and Korea University student Kim JaeHoon.At first glance, the two didn't seem to have anything in common, but both had become closer thanks to Asrian.'I would have never guessed that he was someone aspiring to be a professional gamer...'SeoHyun truly hadn\u2019t been expecting that.No one could have guessed it since JaeHoon was a very private person.From all the people that had come to the reunion that day, only he knew about JaeHoon's aspirations.\"Oh, SeoHyun, are you done for today?\"After exchanging numbers, they began meeting each other frequently whenever they had free time.\"Hey, I'll invite you to dinner.\"\"Ahem, sounds nice.\"SeoHyun couldn't hide a smile.Thanks to JaeHoon, he had been eating in very nice restaurants recently.SeoHyun felt like he was taking advantage of him, but he had no reason to refuse an invitation, especially if the other person would pay for it.After all, people say that the most delicious food is free.Not only that, but he gave him information about Asrian Online from time to time, so SeoHyun thought that it was a reasonable exchange.\"Was pizza always so thick?\"\"That's because it's a Chicago pizza. It's a little bit different from the ones of other franchises.\"While in a restaurant, SeoHyun often remained silent until the topic of Asrian came about.The reason was that this model student rich boy always brought him to expensive restaurants.He always said that fast food was bad for health.SeoHyun thought that JaeHoon was probably the only one in their twenties that thought about things like that.Also, SeoHyun didn't understand what differentiated Chicago Pizza from a regular one except for the fact that it was thicker... But since it was delicious, he kept eating.SeoHyun was stretching the cheese when JaeHoon talked to him first.\"SeoHyun, thanks a lot. Because of the hidden quest you gave me the other day, I was able to level up ten times in just one day.\"JaeHoon was making a huge deal out of the information SeoHyun had given him.He couldn't hide his joy since, according to him, he had been able to save a lot of time compared to his fellow professional gamers.From Hyun's point of view, he had just given him information about quests he didn't need anymore, so he felt uncomfortable with him making such a big deal out of it.\"It really was nothing...\"\"No, I can't just do nothing after receiving such a gift. I told you that I would repay you, remember? I think that the opportunity has come faster than I thought!\"\"Opportunity?\"\"Yes, someone has discovered something huge.\"* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *SeoHyun thought something interesting would come out of his friend's mouth, so he paid attention.As if he was about to say a secret, JaeHoon lowered his tone of voice.\"Yesterday, one of our guild's members found a quest... But this one isn't like the other ones.\"\"Is it a hidden quest?\"\"Not really. It's a normal quest, but the rewards are just amazing!\"JaeHoon took out his smartphone and displayed a photo on the screen.SeoHyun knew that it was a real image taken from Asrian Online.\"It's this quest.\"[<Count Allan's Request: Investigate the Suspicious Light Pillars!>]- I inform all the adventurers of my territory. Yesterday night, and the one before, suspicious light pillars appeared on the Calafer mountain.- According to my Magicians, an evil presence has been detected from them.

Especially this one...\"Said JaeHoon while pointing to a part of his screen.\"It gives skill points! Everyone from our guild is going crazy because of this reward. If we complete this quest, everyone from the party will get a free skill point. This would be like leveling up...\"'It was this, huh?'SeoHyun's expression, as he was looking at JaeHoon with curiosity, darkened.\"You probably won't be able to beat this.\"SeoHyun mumbled. JaeHoon felt as if cold water had been dropped over him.SeoHyun, who was looking at JaeHoon's smartphone, smiled bitterly.'So, this kind of coincidence really does happen. Huh?'The quest JaeHoon has brought to him was basically asking for someone to interfere with the quest he was doing.He never thought that the quest his friend had brought to him as a present was something like this.'What should I do....?'SeoHyun asked JaeHoon after drinking coke.\"Does anyone else besides your guild know about this quest?\"\"I don't think so. After all, quests disappear from the bulletin board once you accept them.\"\"Then, how many users over level 50 does your professional team have?\"\"Hmm... If you join us...\"\"How many without me.\"\"Then\u2026 four people, including me.\"\"Then it would be better if you guys didn't try to complete this quest.\"\"Why? Is there something dangerous about it?\" JaeHoon asked him.He knew that SeoHyun was an Asra Online veteran. Even small bits of information that they had was of great help for newbies.After successfully completing a hidden quest thanks to SeoHyun, JaeHoon listened to what his friend said as if they were sacred words.On the other hand, SeoHyun was concerned about something.'How should I tell this to him...? If you successfully complete the quest, I'll fail mine, so don't do it...? That sounds wrong...'Even in Asra Online, the game often gave users quests with opposing objectives.Every time that happened, they made two users or two groups bite each other and made the game's atmosphere bad.He didn't want to break his friendship with JaeHoon.Don't do this quest because you'll mess up my chances of completing the quest. Saying that would make him look like an egotistical person... But telling a lie made him uncomfortable.\"In two days... You'll learn the reason. It's better if you don't do it.\"\"Should I give up the quest?\"\"That would be the best.\"\"Hmm... Too bad. How should I tell it to the rest of the team?\"\"Ugh, I haven't thought that far... First, try your best to convince them. If not, at least save yourself and avoid being killed.\"\"Die...? You die if you do this quest?\"\"Uhm... That\u2026 sorry.\"\"What are you sorry about...?\"\"No, it's just that I made a mistake of words...\"\"...?\"JaeHoon seemed confused, and SeoHyun scratched his head for a while.* * *\u2014At midnight.Just like the previous day, Hyun and Ain were in the middle of the ruins that were in the Calafer mountain.That was the third day. They were doing a quest from a suspicious old man that consisted of guarding the ruins entrance for an hour starting from midnight.The time was almost over, and no one had appeared.\"Ugh... No one is coming...\" Said Ain while playing with her hands.The two of them were spending time sitting on top of a rock and watching the night sky.What was the old man doing inside the ruin?An intense pillar of light soared as if it were about to reach space for almost an hour.Hyun felt like he was watching a fireworks show.He remembered that during primary school, he went once to see fireworks.He didn't really remember what kind of festival it was.Of course, the night sky of Asrian was more fabulous than what he remembered from that night.On the first day, the light had a white color, but as days passed, it started to become blue.From time to time, he could feel the electricity from the light beam. It felt and seemed like lightning was falling from the sky.The quest time ended, and all the lights disappeared.No one had come.'It seems like JaeHoon succeeded in convincing his teammates.'JaeHoon was part of a professional gaming team.He wondered if a group that only seeks profit would be able to give up on skill points, but it seemed like they had really given up.If a user gave up on a quest, their prestige and reliability decreased. In some cases, it made receiving other quests harder.JaeHoon and his team had probably taken a penalty.'I'm starting to feel sorry.'But from the start, he had no intention of letting them win.In order for his plan to be successful, he needed to clear that quest.'I never pay for dinner, and now I've taken a quest from him. I'm a horrible person.'Soon, the old man came out from the inside of the ruin.What the old man gave them as a reward was a very good sword of unique rarity. If he put it in the Auction House, he would probably be able to get at least 5,000 gold.Did the old man think that they'd lust after an expensive weapon?Neither Hyun nor Ain used a sword as the main weapon, so they didn't care who got to keep it.In other words, Hyun received it.They still hadn't decided how they were going to divide it.Maybe the sword's existence would be eliminated from Ain's memories.The old man who had given them the sword with the expectation of seeing them fight was starting to get even more annoyed.And that's how the third day ended.* * *\u2014South Korea's biggest Asrian community.Users used that place to share information about jobs, skills, and quests, among other things.That place that many people usually frequented was busier than on most other days.The reason was a screenshot that a user had just shared.The post consisted of a quest.The post soon started to trend and made the entire community astonished.[<Count Allan's Request: Investigate the Suspicious Light Pillars!>]- I inform all the adventurers of my territory.

I'll reward the party that eliminates the cause of this light very generously.<Reward: Depends on the contribution of the party>1st place - 30.000 gold, 500,000 experience (The points will be distributed evenly among party members), +5 skill points to all party members, Sword of the Sun.2nd place - 15.000 gold, 300.000 experience (The points will be distributed evenly among party members), +3 skill points to all party members, Wind Magic Spell Book.3rd place - 8.000 gold, 200.000 experience (The points will be distributed evenly among party members), +1 skill point to all party members.Rest - [Participation\u00a0 %] x 1.000 gold, [Participation %] x 10.000 experience.<Limit: Level 50>- This is a very dangerous mission, so all those that haven't awakened are not allowed to participate in it.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 - A Suspicious Old Man's Commission (4)The community exploded.The views on the thread very quickly surpassed a hundred thousand, and it soon became the most popular thread.The experience and gold the quest gave were amazing, but people went crazy because it was the first time a quest that gave skill points as a reward had appeared in Asrian Online.- Is this a hidden quest?- Since Count Allan has posted it as an official document, I don't think so. It seems like a large-scale quest in which many different parties can participate.- Everyone that can do this should do it. Getting one skill point is like a free level up.- All the top users are going crazy, lol.- You can't participate if you aren't level 50?

I mean, there are more than a hundred million players.In the thread, there were more than a thousand comments. All of the new posts on the boards were mostly related to the quest.- Everyone is freaking out about the skill points, but check out the details of the Sword of the Sun. The specs are amazing!- Myth Guild is going to take control of the quest. People who don't want to die, please refrain from coming and keep hunting as you usually do.- LOL, I'm sure you'll be able to control the quest.- South Korea's number 2 guild, White Lotus, will not participate in this quest. We're located too far from the location. If we don't enter among the top three, just the cost of teleporting everyone will be higher than the reward.Asrian had become a god-tier game that would definitely be remembered as one of the greatest of all time.Just in South Korea, there were more than two million players. If you took into consideration the rest of the world, that number became way bigger than that!Not only that, but because the game had opened recently, the number of players was growing each day.Despite all that, the users had a complaint. Even though two months had already passed since the servers opened, there hadn't been any kind of event.'What is NFM doing? Aren't they going to run the game?'If Asrian didn't have so much content already, people would have probably complained more.Even if it didn't have events, Asrian was still a god game.But everyone was kind of let down because of that.Wouldn't it be nice if there was an event that everyone could talk about?And then, suddenly, the count's quest came out.Users were excited.Especially those who liked to comment on the community boards or those who liked to watch streamers, they were getting ready to order some fried chicken.It didn't matter if they couldn't participate in the event because of their low level.They were excited because the top rankers would probably stream the fight in real-time.- This was posted on Reddit too!The count's quest surpassed the borders of the Korean communities and started to spread through the rest of the world.The news that they were going to give away free skill points had a massive ripple effect.- Woah, this is crazy. The Darkness Guild has announced they're going to participate.- (Information) To those that aren't aware. Darkness Guild has the current number 2, 7, and 9 rankers. It's by far the current strongest guild.- This quest's rewards are so great that even top rank guilds are joining in.- Will Lattice come? I know he's a solo player, but still\u2026- I'm not sure. He can choose to either participate or not\u2026 But if it were me, I wouldn't.- That's true. Most guilds will bring tens of players, so I guess that if you play as a solo, you will feel pressured\u2026- It seems like after Darkness Guild announced they'd participate, most medium-sized guilds announced that they wouldn't take part in the quest. But there are also a lot of guilds going for the 2nd, or even 3rd place. If you're not aiming for the top, I think that it's better to give up.- lol, I'm going to grab some popcorn. This is going to be interesting.- I'm in the town that's in front of the place where the quest is going to take place, and there are a lot of people, hahaha.- It seems like everyone went there to take a closer look.The Darkness Guild moved especially fast.Only a few hours had passed since the thread was posted, but they were already in the middle of the Calafer mountain.After hearing that, South Korea's number 1 guild, Hwarang, and the 3rd one, Myth, tried to gather as many members as possible, but all the good spots had already been taken by members of Darkness.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\"Can't we enter the place where the quest is going to take place? If there's a boss monster inside, I want to hunt it down before it starts,\" asked the leader of the Darkness Guild, XL.A guild member answered him.\"It's impossible because it's sealed. Someone tried to move first by using flight magic\u2026\"\"And what happened next?\"\"He was hit with lightning and disappeared without leaving any trace\u2026\"\"Then we should wait\u2026\"The leader of the Darkness Guild looked at the entrance of the ruins.It was rather narrow. Its width was 10 meters.XL, who was a graduate of an Ivy League University, concluded something.\"If it's this narrow, all the parties won't be able to fight simultaneously.\"\"That means\u2026?\"\"I think that we should let another guild fight first.\"The guild members were surprised by XL's decision.According to the quest description, the ranking was decided by how much they had contributed.Everyone knew that letting someone else take the lead would result in the % of their contribution going down.\"But\u2026 What if someone takes the 1st ranking from us\u2026\"\"That won't happen,\" XL answered with confidence.\"If we think that there's a possibility of that happening, we can just wipe out both sides simultaneously. Also\u2026\"\"There's something I felt while playing this game\u2026 Great rewards are often accompanied by danger. I don't think that a quest that rewards five skill points is going to be solved easily.\"\"That means\u2026 You think that the quest is going to be very hard\u2026?\"\"Yes. I think that we're probably the only ones that can beat this quest.\"\"Woah\u2026\"\"That's why we should move later on. If we're in a situation where we could lose the 1st position, we can always flip-flop, but everything will be decided based on the circumstances.\"* * *Hyun and Ain hunted until midnight, and then they finished the preparations.After learning their ultimate attacks, their hunting speed had increased a lot.Even though hunting named monsters wasn't effective in terms of experience gained, Hyun and Ain were already at level 65.If you considered only the level, they would barely be able to enter the top 100, but if you looked closely, the truth was different.Hyun (Lv. 65)HP: 1560/1560Mana: 590/590Job: Support (Hidden)[Strength: 2] [Agility: 56] [Vitality: 24] [Magical Power: 59] [Empathy: 156]<Skill List>[\u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb Lv.8] - <+Open>[\u00abShield\u00bb Lv.0] - <+Open>[\u00abPowerless Wave\u00bb Lv.2] - <Open><Awakening Skill>[\u00abAssimilation\u00bb Lv.0] - <Open>[\u203b You have 2 unused skill points!]Ain (Lv.65)<Player 'Hyun's soul is assimilating!>HP: 3120/3120Mana: 2660/2660Job: Close Range Magician (Hidden)[Strength: 23] [Agility: 80(+5)] [Vitality: 46(+2)] [Magical Power: 167(+99)]<Skill List>[\u00abFlame Claws\u00bb Lv.5(+1)] - <+Open><Awakening Skill>[\u00abPrepared for Extinction\u00bb Lv.0] - <+Open>[\u203b You have 40 unused skill points!]<Titles>[Deceiver] - <+Open>Hyun and Ain were both at level 65, But their stats were those of someone at level 120. However, If you took into consideration the bonus of \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, it was at the level of someone that was at 180.That was all thanks to the achievements obtained by being the first ones to kill named monsters.According to their experience in Asra Online, as the game progressed to the latter half, stats became more important than levels.There hadn't been many changes except that Hyun had learned \u00abVision Sword\u00bb.The reason was that Hyun lacked skill points, and Ain couldn't find any useful skills except for \u00abFlame Claws\u00bb.'I'll learn another skill later on. After all, I have Hyun\u2026 So I think that I'm okay for now.'That's what Ain answered when he asked her about skills.Was she saving them for when she can change jobs at level 100?Just like she said, maybe it would be best to save up the skill points if everything was going well.\u2014Fourth day of the quest.While they were finishing the preparations, night came to the city.There were still 20 minutes left until midnight.There wasn't much time left, but Hyun wasn't feeling pressured.By Assimilating to Ain, they would be able to reach the middle of the mountain very quickly.\"Why are there so many people?\"\"It seems like there's a festival around here.\"Hyun and Ain hadn't left the capsule since the afternoon, so they weren't aware of what was going on in the communities.\"This place is usually a quiet hunting place\u2026\"Around the Calafer mountain, there were many users hunting.They looked like the crowd that flocked to a popular restaurant.\"This place shouldn't be effective in terms of experience gained. Why is it that there are so many people?\"There were so many people that Hyun was starting to get annoyed.Hyun immediately used \u00abAssimilation\u00bb and entered Ain's body.\"It's better inside me, right?\" Said Ain with a mischievous smile. Then, while stepping between the tree branches, she began to run.People that were hunting turned around in surprise, but Ain's 85 agility was so fast that she quickly disappeared from their sight.They arrived at the ruins a few minutes before the quest began.In front of the ruins entrance, many people were waiting for midnight to come.As soon as the gate opened, the guilds would begin competing for who would get to move first.While everyone kept their eyes open so they wouldn't be left behind by other guilds, they saw a girl crossing the entrance.It was something obvious, but Hyun and Ain, who were the targets of the quest, weren't affected by the limits placed around the ruins.\"Hmm?\"\"What happened?\"Suddenly, all the users focused their attention on the entrance.As the girl casually passed through the ruin's entrance, everyone sitting around stood up in surprise.\"What\u2026? Did the seal break?\"\"We can now enter!\"\"Really? Then we\u2026 Ugh. Argg-!\"Zapp-\u00a0Someone ran towards the entrance and soon began shaking as if he was electrocuted\u2014he soon turned into light and scattered away.After seeing someone die, everyone stopped in their steps.They'd discovered that they would also die in vain if they ran towards the entrance right then.\"Kid, how did you enter the ruins?\" A man that looked middle-aged asked Ain carefully.That man was the vice-commander of the Myth Guild, the third biggest in South Korea.Ain looked up.\"Who\u2026?\"Ain looked at him with sharp eyes as if she were staring at an enemy.Ain had a slight smile on her face, but sharp knives were hidden behind that smile.But Myth Guild's vice-commander couldn't see her expression since she was covering herself with a robe.\"Haha, if you're an NPC, you probably won't know\u2026 Who I am? Have you heard about the Myth Guild? It's South Korea's number 3 guild, and I'm the\u2014\"\"Are you trying to pass through the door?\" Ain interrupted the man.The vice-commander thought that the girl had bad manners, but soon changed his opinion.\u2018Yes, she's probably a foreigner. Maybe the auto-translate option broke\u2026 Or perhaps she's an NPC, so she doesn't know about things like manners.\u2019The important thing was learning how to pass through the ruin's entrance.\"Yes. Do you know how to enter? If so\u2026\"At that moment\u2026Fwoosh-!Ain's hands were covered in fire and hit the man in the waist.The sight of his upper and lower half getting cut in half by melting would have been too cruel if it weren't a game.Everyone was horrified because it had all happened in just an instant.\"Hmm\u2026 But you aren't allowed to enter here\u2026\"\"Wh-what\u2026!\"Surprised, the Myth Guild members took out their weapons and aimed them toward the girl who murdered their vice-commander.Ain didn't seem to mind the hostility directed toward her. She kept talking with a smile on her face.\"It seems like everyone wants to enter here.\"Fwoosh-.As soon as Ain finished talking, a blue light beam rose to the sky from behind her.Electricity came out from the light pillars that reached space while making noise.[There are 60 minutes left before the quest ends!][Defend the entrance of the ruin!]\"Of course, no one will be able to enter.\"12:00 am. Midnight.The last hour of the hidden quest had begun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 - Count's Quest (1)The Gamez.It was the biggest cable channel dedicated to video games.The Gamez had recently created a show dedicated to Asrian Online, but despite the game's success, the show had a low audience.Since it was an RPG game, there weren't any tournaments. Also, it didn't have a lot of content that made users compete with each other.For the person in charge of the show about Asrian, that uproar was as welcome as rain in the middle of a drought.The Count's quest!Not only were South Korea's biggest guilds involved, but there were also famous guilds from all over the world participating. Even the Darkness Guild was going to take part in it.There was no way they were going to let such a good opportunity go, so even all the employees stayed to prepare for broadcasting.The show was also being broadcasted through different internet platforms; only one of them had more than fifty thousand viewers.\"Hi, I'm commentator Im SeongJun!\"\"I'm co-commentator Kim SooYong.\"Those two, whom the viewers were familiar with, began talking in a cheerful voice.The commentator Im SeongJun was a veteran who had previously worked for more than ten years commenting on another game.The co-commentator Kim SooYong was a professional gamer who had been playing a MOBA and had recently switched to Asrian Online.Just by seeing that those two were in charge of the show, you could see how interested The Gamez was in Asrian Online.- Is a match about to start? LOL.- SeongJun is working hard.Even those writing in the chat seemed happy to see familiar faces.Just like always, Im SeongJun smoothly began to host the program.\"Yes, so there's a lot to talk about the Count's quest. Isn't this the first time the so-called Nero guilds have gathered in one place?\"\"Yes, it's the first time indeed. Even though it's been only two months since the servers opened, that doesn't change the fact that this is the first time.\"\"South Korea's Hwarang and Myth Guild, and other guilds from foreign countries. You've heard about the Darkness Guild, right? They're currently in the number 1 position, and they have traveled all the way there to take part in the quest.\"\"That's right. There's a system in Asrian Online that decides where you will start based on your IP address. There aren't more guilds from foreign countries because Count Allan's territory is where Korean players begin the game. Of course, players from other places could come, but to do that, they would have to spend a lot of money to teleport.\"\"Oh, I see, so even in Asrian Online, there are borders? Of course, it's not a real border. You don't need to bring your passport, after all.\"Since there was still some time left before the quest began, the presenters were lightly joking around or talking about information related to Asrian Online that they knew about.\"Oh, the truth is that we have another piece of exclusive information!\"Im SeongJun, just as expected from an experienced broadcaster, picked the right moment to talk about hot news.\"The person next to me, player Kim SooYong! No, at the moment, co-commentator Kim SooYong, was one of the first persons who heard about this quest.\"\"Who told you that...?\"\"But the most incredible thing is that after receiving the quest, he decided to give up on it. Co-commentator Kim SooYong, is that rumor true?!\"Question marks plastered the chat. Kim SooYong smiled awkwardly.\"Hmm... It's true. Our Guild discovered this quest first by pure coincidence.\"As evidence, a screenshot that Stardust had provided was posted on the screen.In that screenshot, you could see the details of a quest.Even though the rewards differed slightly, the quest's mission was the same.\"Woah, so it's true! I thought that you were joking! Can you tell me why you decided to pass on a quest with such good rewards?\"\"It's a shame, but we concluded that the quest was too dangerous, so we decided to give up on it.\"Im SeongJun wanted to ask another thing, but Kim SooYong quickly changed the topic of the discussion.\"Don't ask me the reason. I won't comment anymore in regards to this topic.\"\"Too bad, I won't dig anymore on this\u2026 But if another Guild clears this quest today, you'll probably regret it a lot, right?\"\"If that happens, I probably won't be able to sleep.\"After checking out the time, Im SeongJun began the show officially.It was the order in which Im SeongJun was thinking of presenting the program.First, he would start talking about the guilds participating in the quest.Then, he would talk about what made the Darkness Guild so strong.And as the quest progressed, he would talk about conflicts among the guilds.In such a place, there would be for sure conflict among guilds. They would probably kill each other because of how the rewards worked, so he wanted to talk about the guild's strategies regarding that.\"Then, should we start talking about South Korea's Rank 3 guild, the Myth Guild? Co-commentator Kim SooYong, what kind of guild is Myth Guild?\"\"Yeah, so Myth Guild is basically...\"The incident happened when Kim SooYong was about to start talking about his research and analysis of the guilds.Someone who was captured on the screen had just ignored the barrier placed by the quest and entered the ruin.And a few seconds later\u2026Fwoosh! One user was melted down. He died instantly.\"Wh-what happened?!\"\"Did the conflict among guilds escalate into a fight already?\"While the commentators were confused and didn't know what to say, it became midnight.At the same time, a blue light pillar rose from inside the ruin, and that was the signal for the start of the war.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The bowstring drawn to its breaking point snapped.Whir-!A blue aura leaked out from Ain's body from the moment the battle had started.\u00abPowerless Wave\u00bb.\u2014It was Hyun's skill that lowered the defense of the opponents near them.\"Kill her!\"The members of the Myth Guild, who had just lost their vice-commander and were blinded by rage, charged toward Ain.The members of the Myth Guild thought that Ain was someone from a rival guild.They thought that someone from another guild had killed their vice-commander to weaken them.In fact, things like that had happened until a few hours prior, so they didn't suspect Ain's identity.Fwoosh, Fwoosh!Ain covered her hands in fire and scratched the opponents twice.The two members of Myth Guild that were charging toward Ain became ash.No, they turned into light and scattered away.Hyun, who was whispering, laughed in disbelief.\u300cWhy are they making things easier for you...?\u300dAin kept killing members of Myth Guild with a blank expression on her face.She was doing PVP, the thing she enjoyed the most, but she didn't seem to be having fun.Hyun knew the reason.\u300cAren't these guys the type of players you hate the most?\u300dThat's right. The players Ain had just defeated had expensive items, but their skills were disappointing.Just seeing their party formation and how they reacted was enough to know that they didn't care about control.In fact, one couldn't join Myth Guild without having a lot of money, but there was no way Hyun and Ain knew about that.\u300cIf they're all at this level, I won't have to do anything.\u300dHyun kept watching the fight from inside Ain.From a distance, arrows flew toward Ain, but she easily brushed them away with her hand.The attacks were slow enough to make one yawn.All of the arrows that Ain had brushed off fell to the ground.\"What... Does she have immunity to physical attacks?\"\u300cHaha, he's asking if you have immunity to physical attacks.\u300dHyun laughed at what the Thief had said.But what was even funnier was that the head of the Myth Guild had reached the same conclusion.\"Don't use physical attacks! Magicians, begin casting!\"At his orders, the Magicians began casting their spells.The Myth guild had eight members per party, meaning Ain currently only had to deal with that one party,It seemed like they'd brought as many people as possible, but they weren't a menace to Hyun and Ain.\"How stupid...\"Ain seemed disappointed after seeing the Magicians casting their spells.It didn't matter if there were eight or even eighty. A Magician standing still while casting was as dangerous as a scarecrow for Ain.Whish-Ain penetrated their formation.As she moved in a zigzag pattern, fire flashed as if it were lightning.\"Damn! Don't attack me!\"\"Tanker, what is our tanker doing!\"From time to time, members of the Myth Guild ended up attacking each other.It was a common mistake in less skillful guilds when there were a lot of different parties involved.Fwoosh! Flames ran across the land as a gale, turning two people into light and scattering them away.As Ain's fire-covered hands drew a half-moon, all the opponents' bodies in the trajectory of her attack melted down.Just touching the fire was enough to kill them!That was because Magicians had low HP.\"Boring...\"Ain charged again and burned another two opponents.She then hit the ground, ran up the wall, and melted an opponent's head.All of it happened in just a few seconds.However, even while fighting like that, she wasn't feeling the thrill people would usually feel while dueling.She had more fun fighting the party of four from a few days ago.\u300cThe difference between their stat balance is too big.\u300dHyun accurately pinpointed the problem.There were many members of the Myth Guild there, but no one had a skill useful for a fight against another user.It was the same in terms of stats.Is it that they didn\u2019t know the importance of agility while fighting?\u300cThey raised their characters to make hunting monsters of that level easy...\u300d\u2014Skills that were slow but strong.\u2014Skills that had a long casting time.Those types of skills were useless while fighting against another player.If they had a little bit of understanding of the game, they would have known what stats were important and what skills were useful.\"Ugh... Come on, look at me!\"A Warrior holding a shield was using a provocation skill.Hyun burst into laughter.The Warrior's provocation skill was only useful against monsters. Why would he use it there...?'Don't tell me... Do they think that Ain is a humanoid monster?'Ain didn't fall for the Warrior's provocation and moved freely through the front and back of the enemy's formation.In the Myth Guild, there was no one capable of stopping Ain.There wasn't anyone who had good enough specs to catch up to her. Not only that, but there wasn't anyone as skillful as her.All abnormal status skills that required aim were missing her.Ain looked like a wolf going through a flock of sheep.\"We can't keep doing this! Everyone, attack her all at once! Even if she's resistant to physical attacks, if we keep attacking her, maybe she'll die!\"Was it because he was having a hard time looking at his fellow guild members die? The head of the Myth Guild gave a ridiculous order.At that moment, all Warriors and Thieves charged toward her.There were approximately 10 players.\u300cHmm... I think too many players are charging against us at one time...\u300dMore than fighting, Hyun was interested in the opponent's strategy.How were they planning to attack in such a narrow place all at once? Hyun decided to look carefully.If they used a strategy he hadn't thought of, he would have been impressed.But what was happening in front of him was just as he expected.Fwoosh-Ain backed off a little bit and swung her arm.Two people died from that simple attack that wasn't even fast.To avoid being hit with a swing, you had to move backward.But they had no space to move because there were allies behind them.And just like that, two users had been neutralized.\u300cThey didn't die.\u300dThe two people who had their arms cut off were falling down.They hadn't died, but since they couldn't fight anymore, it didn't really matter.Ain didn't stop moving.Immediately, a sword came in her direction while targeting her forehead.Ain brushed the sword with one hand and, with the other one, hit him while rotating it.Critical Hit!As Ain's hands covered in fire ripped apart the opponent's head, he turned into light and exploded.The one she had killed was a heavily armed tanker.But it really didn't matter who it was. By taking advantage of the body defect system, anyone could be killed by just one hit.\"Don't attack her individually! Do it all together!\"Even though he was starting to panic, the head of the guild kept ordering the other members.But Ain's specialty was psychological warfare.The moment the opponents tried to back off, she charged toward them.All humans become flustered at the unexpected.Suppose you suddenly change your fight style from one based on counter-attacking to an aggressive one. In that case, the opponent would probably be surprised and start to panic.That was the current state of the members of the Myth Guild.Stab-!Ain, who rushed like a flash, used her hands to penetrate the Warrior's chest.Ain targeted his heart. The moment she landed a critical hit, she activated the body defect system.Ain rotated the hand she had used to stab the opponent.She looked like fireworks dancing in the night air!Two more enemies that were in her way turned into light and scattered away.Ain, who had just killed three people, didn't rest and leaped once more.That time she was targeting the head of the Myth Guild, who was standing safely behind the rest.Among the members of the Myth Guild, no one could catch up to Ain. After all, her agility was 80. On top of that, you had to add the bonus given by my \u00abAssimilation\u00bb.She reached the head of the guild before the rest could understand what she was trying to do.\"D-Damn...!\"Surprised, he tried to take a defensive posture.Fwoosh- Fwoosh-\u00a0Flames flew in all directions.It was impossible for him to stop all the flames in the first place.While going around the guild leader, she landed five attacks on him.\"What? Damn... Damn!\"Still, he was the leader of the Myth Guild\u2014famous for being rich.After receiving five hits and cursing, he turned into light and disappeared.The head of the guild had died.And just like that, the Myth Guild began to crumble.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 - Count's Quest (2)\"Oh, there has been a broadcasting accident.\"Commentator Im SeongJun seemed flustered by the curse words.During the live broadcast, Myth Guild's leader had cursed.Kim SooYong also tried to fix the situation as fast as he could.\"Most people appearing on screen, rather than professional players, are ordinary people; that's why the vocabulary can get rough from time to time.\"\"Yes. Also, that person was probably annoyed because they had failed the quest. I'm sure he wasn't trying to criticize or insult anyone.\"\"That's right. Also, it's not a violation of broadcasting rights. If you read the terms of service, it clearly says that you provide personal information to NFM except for those related to your real life. Since we have signed a contract with NFM, we can show all the game footage.\"After stating their protective rights, they finally went back to talking about the game.Both commentators had concluded that defeating the quest was impossible for the Myth Guild in the first place.After the leader died, members of the Myth Guild began falling just like domino pieces.\"Who would have thought that South Korea's third-biggest guild would fall so easily?\"\"Yeah\u2026 But there was nothing they could've done. The boss of the quest wasn\u2019t only too strong, but she was also clever. She fought while using the terrain very effectively.\"As expected from a professional gamer, Kim SooYong pointed out the most important things.\"She took advantage of how narrow the entrance was to create one versus one and one versus two situations. The members of Myth Guild ended up getting annoyed and tried to attack all at once, but that ended up creating a bottleneck that ended up destroying them.\"\"Woah, hearing your explanation makes it more chilling. As expected from an advanced artificial intelligence!\"\"Yes. What happened today just shows that, in this game, humanoid NPCs are scarier than monsters.\"Kim SooYong's words weren't wrong.It was true that in Asrian, there were a couple of humanoid NPC bosses that were almost as intelligent as real human beings; it was also true that those bosses were usually so strong that they would make you tremble in fear.The only mistake he had made was that neither Ain nor Hyun were NPCs.\"News! Hwarang Guild, 1st ranking guild in South Korea, has announced that they'll give up on the quest!\"\"It's understandable. After seeing how strong the enemy is, it would be reckless to challenge her.\"While commentating on the quest, Kim SooYong felt relieved.The organization he was part of, Stardust, had been about to do the Count's quest, but in the end, they had decided to give up on it.At that moment, he thought that they were letting a huge opportunity go and wanted to cry. But when he saw the news, he felt relieved.\"After Hwarang Guild announced that they'd give up, it seems like smaller ones have also decided to do the same. You can see them packing their stuff up and going down the mountain.\"\"But it hasn't ended yet. Darkness, the 1st ranked guild, still hasn't given up!\"Even though most Korean guilds had given up, people in the chat were excited.More than eighty thousand people were watching on only one streaming channel.The show hosted by The Gamez was in Korean, so if you added all the different shows around the world that covered topics about Asrian Online, there would probably be a lot more people than that.Since Darkness was a foreign guild, people from other countries would probably also be interested in what was happening.\"So there's still 40 minutes left until the quest ends! Darkness, will they be able to beat the boss?!\"\"In my opinion, Darkness is the only guild that has a chance to clear this quest. The reason is that the worldwide 2nd, 7th, and 9th are all members of Darkness.\"\"Why are there so many rankers?!\"\"Especially the one who\u2019s 2nd in the rankings, Mayday, became a trending topic after reaching level 90. It is safe to say that there's almost no difference compared to Lattice, who's at level 95.\"\"Woah, level 90? I can't even imagine what route you have to use to level up so fast.\"\"Oh, it seems like members of Darkness have begun moving!\"\"I can't wait. It's known that Darkness selects members based on their talents. But up until today, the skill of their members has been hidden under a veil, so today we're finally going to be able to see what they're capable of.\"* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The leader of Darkness, XL, nodded while watching the Myth Guild crumble.'Is she the one from that video\u2026?'Although it was relatively unknown on Korean community boards, there was a video that had trended on Reddit.It was a video titled, 'Two Person, Named Monster Clear Footage.'XL thought that the quest\u2019s boss was definitely one of the two people that had appeared in that video.'I'm certain of it!'The way she fought against opponents with her fists covered in fire and that scruffy black robe wasn't ordinary.Most people in Darkness knew about that video.A few members had used that video to study how to control one's character.\"What were those guys\u2019 identities?\"\"You can't even remember something that happened a month ago?\"After hearing the question XL asked himself, a woman glanced at him with a pitiful look.She was the vice-commander of Darkness, Reina.Even though she barely entered the top 100 players ranking, it was because of the limits of the Priest job.Reina had become the vice-commander of Darkness because everyone recognized her charisma and decision-making capabilities.\"People have concluded that they were dark priests. That was also why the number of people choosing the priest job increased.\"XL clapped.\"Oh yeah. For a while, everyone wanted to change jobs to a dark priest.\"XL gulped and looked at the battlefield.The dark priest, who seemed to be the quest's boss, was dazzlingly stirring the flames.She was definitely strong.XL felt that if he stayed still watching the flames dance, he would be burned down without leaving even a trace.\"Do you think we can do it?\" Reina, who was next to him, asked.\"I think that we have a chance\u2026\"\"Oh, really?\"Reina had a weird expression on her face while watching XL.Just as his nickname indicated, XL had a thick body. But unlike his dull appearance, he was actually someone with sharp analytical skills.What University did he graduate from?She didn't remember very well, but she remembered that the rest of the guild members were surprised by it.\"I think that there's a 50% chance.\"After thinking deeply for a while, XL finally spoke.Reina thought she had heard wrong.\"Half? Even though we have Pias, Bear Shield, and even Mayday?\"\"The opponent is that strong\u2026 From the moment we heard that they were giving away skill points as a reward, we knew that the quest would be hard to beat.\"\"Yeah, that's true.\"\"We have to do our best. After all, there's still a 50% chance of clearing the quest.\"Through the guild's chat, XL started giving orders to everyone.The 1st ranked guild, Darkness, started moving toward their goal.* * *Ain had easily defeated the Myth Guild alone.The only skill Hyun had used to help her was Powerless Wave.But there was still a long way to go.The quest duration was 60 minutes, but only 20 had passed.\"I hope the next guys are decent,\" Ain mumbled while looking into the distance.New enemies were approaching them.Just by seeing the number of opponents, they concluded that the enemies were probably members of a big guild.\u300cThey're a little bit different.\u300dHyun felt uneasy.He had only taken a glance at them but still felt prudence and seriousness in their movements.He felt something different in them compared to other users.\u300cAre they rankers?\u300dHyun had guessed correctly.They were the worldwide 1st ranked guild, Darkness!\u300cHmm\u2026?\u300dHyun's eyes narrowed.From the opponent's side of the battlefield, only one user was approaching them.\u300cDon't tell me he's going to fight alone?\u300dHyun recognized his bravery in case that user was a ranker, but he was also very self-confident.He knew the current level of the top rankers in the hall of fame.'At this moment of the game, when there are no users over level 100, not even ten rankers should be able to defeat us.'Maybe in the distant future, they could do it.Because of the huge number of players that Asrian had, there should be many talented people.But at that moment, it was too early.In terms of stats and skill utilization, they shouldn't be able to compete against them.\u300cHmm?\u300dThose thoughts of Hyun\u2019s disappeared.That one user was receiving buffs non-stop.Whap- From that person's body, a stream of light started to rise, and holy energy enveloped his weapon.A sphere of light started to go around the long spear he had, and a mysterious pattern appeared under his feet.Hyun, who had memorized most skills, knew what buffs they had used just by seeing the effects.[\u00abMana Armor\u00bb]: For five minutes, the target receives half damage.[\u00abImaginary Shield\u00bb]: For three minutes, reduce all damage received by 500 points.[\u00abEngine Acceleration\u00bb]: For 10 minutes, increase Agility by 30%.[\u00abElfer's Power\u00bb]: For five minutes, movements become 50% faster.[\u00abThe God that Dwells in Weapons\u00bb]: For three minutes, add 150 lightning damage to attacks.Those five buffs were the awakening skills of either Magicians or Priests.They had used five ultimate attacks to buff a single person.Hyun was glad there was a limit on the number of buffs one could receive. He didn't even want to think what else they would've done if there wasn't a limit.Even Hyun started to feel chills.\"Woah, it doesn't feel like my body.\"Whish- Whish-The Darkness guild member that had received all the buffs spoke while he swung the spear around.That man was Pias, a warrior ranked 9th in the world rankings.Among the members of the Darkness Guild, no one could beat him in hand-to-hand combat.Members of the Darkness Guild had seen how easily the Myth Guild was destroyed.They couldn't fight properly because of the narrow space and were easily defeated.XL had concluded that if they couldn't fight properly as a group because of the narrow space, he'd rather have all the buffs applied to a single person.\"Attack now! All buffs are going to disappear after five minutes!\"\"Yes, yes, understood, big sister!\"At the orders of the vice-commander Reina, Pias got ready to attack.The target was the dark priest who was wearing a black robe.Pias hit the ground and leaped towards the opponent while his spear cut through the air.His speed, which had increased by more than double, was so fast that you might lose sight of him if you didn't concentrate.To make things worse, it was nighttime.The Pias\u2019s attack looked as if the light itself was charging toward the enemy to annihilate them.\"Ugh\u2026?\"But Pias was forced to stop his leap.The target, instead of evading, had rushed towards him and reduced the distance between them.The skill that Pias had just used, 'Lance Charge,' required him to maintain a certain distance from the enemy to be effective.But because the opponent reduced the distance, he had failed.\u300cWhy were you standing still\u2026?! I had to dodge the attack!\u300dHyun scolded Ain through a whisper.Ain hadn't moved at all while watching Lance Charge coming toward her.Ain's answer was ridiculous.\u300cI was thinking of counter-attacking and letting it flow.\u300d\u300cYou can easily cancel that skill by moving a little bit. Why were you planning to use such a dangerous strategy?\u300d\u300cBecause it would be more fun, right?\u300dOof\u2026 Hyun wanted to grab his head.That was Ain's biggest weakness.It didn't matter what kind of attack came toward her. Instead of dodging it, she always thought of fighting it head-on.That's why she was often defeated by skills she didn't know about.Even during the awakening quests, she was defeated by the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb.While she played as a werewolf, it really didn't matter because of the high HP. But at the moment, she was playing as a Close Range Magician.'I wish she wouldn\u2019t try such reckless things while having a body as weak as a paper.'Since they were sharing the same body, Hyun thought that he would have to look out for her safety.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 - Count's Quest (3)A Thief threw a bunch of ninja stars from the rear.Thanks to Hyun's \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb, all of the attacks bounced away from Ain's body.Thanks to Hyun watching over her, Ain could focus on the one-on-one combat.Whish- Ain hit Pias with a punch that resembled a boxer's jab.\"Ugh\u2026\"Pias moaned in pain.He bent his waist and avoided being hit, but cold sweat dripped from his neck.The opponent's speed was on a whole other level compared to the enemies he had fought against up until then!He was also fast, but she was faster.He couldn't believe he was slower than the enemy even though he had received all kinds of buffs.'Just how much agility does she have\u2026?!'He was lucky that he had been able to instinctively avoid being hit.Also, he didn't understand why, but the opponent's attack was abnormally high.'Wait, why are my defensive stats at zero\u2026?'Pias, who was panicking, looked at Ain's feet.There was an aura that emitted an ominous light.The moment his body touched it, he could feel his body being on edge.'If I make a mistake, I'm done\u2026'Pias looked at the opponent's hands.It would be too late for him if he couldn't react to her movements.But before he could get a hold of his breath\u2026\u00abVision Sword\u00bb!'A shining blade made of light emerged.Hyun used the absorbed damage to hit Pias on the waist with the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb.[You've dealt 230 damage!]\"Huh\u2026?\"Ain seemed confused after reading the notification.\u300cWhy is that thief so weak? Even though I absorbed all his attacks, it didn't add up to much.\u300dHyun complained.The \u00abVision Sword\u00bb's attack varied depending on the opponent's damage absorbed.He had received all the ninja stars on purpose with the goal of increasing \u00abVision Sword\u00bb's damage, but the result was worse than he had thought.He was starting to miss Ain's punches.\u300cHyun, don't waste my mana.\u300d\u300cSorry\u2026\u300dThe \u00abVision Sword\u00bb used 50 mana, which was a considerable amount.If the damage output was low, there was no point in using it.'Should I avoid attacking at all\u2026?'When he thought about it, maybe that would be better.Instead of attacking, perhaps it would be better if he was in charge of defense. After all, it would be hard for her to dodge all the opponent's attacks.\u300cIt would be better if we divided the roles.\u300d\u300cHow?\u300d\u300cI'll take care of the long-range attacks. You just focus on the close-range combat.\u300dAin tilted her head at Hyun's explanation.Would they be able to divide the roles while controlling the same body?Hyun cleared her doubts.\u300cGive me the control priority.\u300dIf they gave two opposing orders simultaneously, whose command would the body listen to?The thing he needed at that moment was control priority.\u300cPriority?\u300d\u300cYes. You just have to fight as you usually do. I'll take control if something dangerous flies towards you.\u300dHyun was better than her in terms of skill usage, knowledge about the different types of skills, and overall gaming skills.But there was something she was better at than Hyun: PvP.Hyun was planning to take advantage of both of their strong points.\u300cIs something like that possible\u2026?\u300d\u300cProbably\u2026\u300d\u300cHmm\u2026 I'm not sure, but let\u2019s do as you say.\u300dAlthough she was not sure, she decided to trust Hyun.She made that decision because she knew that Hyun's greatest strength was his ability to see the opponent's weakness and improvise solutions.The battle started to heat up.Ain's flames and Pias\u2019s lance clashed.Their exchange of blows resembled something from an action movie.Even though their speed was similar, it was clear that Pias was at a disadvantage as time went on.\"Tsk\u2026\"Suddenly, flames covered Pias's eyes.Ain had swung her arms and blocked his field of view.When you did not know where the attack would come from, the safest option was to back off.Pias tried to leap backward, but Ain had already seen through him.Ain blocked his view with one hand and used the other one to hit him.When Pias stepped on the floor, Ain's hands were already at his chin.\"Damn\u2026!\"[You have received 1584 damage!]\"No!\"Swoop-!As Pias came under danger, other Darkness members began casting magic.Fireballs, spears made of ice, daggers, and ninja stars flew in their direction simultaneously.But Hyun was already prepared for long-range attacks.As he used \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb and leaped backward, Ain's action of trying to forcibly land hits on the enemy was canceled.\u2014It was because Hyun had control priority.As soon as Ain moved backward, the enemies\u2019 attacks poured down.\u300cIt's possible, see?\u300dHyun said while laughing.By using \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb correctly, they could safely exchange the control in any situation.That was the strategy Hyun had thought of to safely exchange the character's control.\u300cTo be honest, I think we were lucky\u2026\u300d\u300cThen let's try again until you're sick of it.\u300dNod.Ain leaped forward again.Fwoosh- Fwoosh- Fwoosh-!Flames struck Pias's spear.It was a series of attacks that had offbeat movements and feints mixed together!Pias, who was trying his best to face the constant influx of fire attacks, was about to lose his mind.He tried to protect himself by backing off\u2026 But it was hard.Pias was in danger.At that moment\u2026Flash-! A magic circle was drawn under Ain's feet.\u00abMetal Edge\u00bb.The sharp metal pillar that rose from the ground was an attack from members of Darkness that were trying to support Pias.If you were fighting, it would have probably been hard to react against a sudden magical attack that came out of nowhere\u2026 But if you were just looking out for potential dangers, you could respond easily.\u201c\u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb, \u00abShield\u00bb!\"For a few seconds, all enemy attacks stopped.Thanks to \u00abShield\u00bb, everyone that had attacked Ain had been stunned.\u300cAin, now!\u300d\u300cI know\u2026!\u300d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Ain's eyes began shining just like those of a wolf looking at prey.A wild beast never misses an opportunity.Because everyone was stunned, that opportunity had come.The flame flared and struck Pias five times.The 9th person in the world rankings became light and scattered away in a split second.\"Ah\u2026!\"Mayday, the 2nd in the rankings, groaned.Mayday's role was to support Pias whenever he was in danger.But what had happened?He wasn't hit with an attack that caused abnormal status, yet for three seconds, his mind had become blank.He had just sat still while watching Pias be beaten up.Because he was distracted, Pias had become ashes.The reason Mayday's mind was absent for a few seconds was because of Hyun's \u00abShield\u00bb skill, but he thought it was because he was distracted.\"Mayday, did you just make a mistake?!\" Reina shouted in disbelief.It was the first time they had seen Mayday make a mistake. After all, she was a perfectionist.\"I couldn't move for a moment\u2026\"Mayday looked stunned.But soon, she shook her head.\"No, I won't make any more mistakes like that\u2026!\" Mayday said while biting her lips.Causing an inconvenience for her entire guild because of a mistake she made once was enough.She couldn't do anything about what had happened, but at least she wouldn't make the same mistake twice.Clap Clap-\u00a0The head of the guild, XL, clapped and tried to lighten the mood.\"Let's keep doing our best until the end. We, Darkness, still have a chance.\"Pias had died, but there were other users that could take his position.The battle wasn't over yet.* * *'It's easier than I thought.'Hyun seemed relaxed.Was it because they were still at the early stages of the game? Even though the opponents were rankers, he and Ain weren\u2019t having a hard time.The reason was quite simple.\u2014In the early stages of the game, there wasn't a job that could resist the ridiculously high attack of the Close Range Magician.On top of that, there was his Support class.Not only that but there was also his \u00abAssimilation\u00bb skill that increased stats and the \u00abPowerless Wave\u00bb skill.The +1 skill level increase of \u00abAssimilation\u00bb also couldn't be ignored.At that point in the game, they were practically invincible.\"I don't have any mana left.\"\u300cIt's okay.\u300dThey also had a way to solve the Close Range Magician's high mana consumption issue.The moment Ain drank the 'Weak Heaven's Elixir' they had gotten from the old man, that weakness disappeared.[Your HP has temporarily increased by +20,000!][Your mana recovery speed has increased by 10 times!]Ain was as strong as a boss monster that had overwhelming attacking power.A boss monster controlled by both Hyun and Ain.'Too bad we had to use the elixir, but since there's this many people, there's nothing we can do about it.'A new user walked out from the Darkness Guild\u2019s side.A warrior that was 7th in the rankings, Bear Shield.It seemed like they had decided to use him, one of the best tankers in the world, as the vanguard.\u300cI see, so they're planning to keep fighting using this same strategy.\u300dThe new guy also received a lot of buffs, just like the previous one.Even though he had become stronger, he still wasn't a menace to Hyun and Ain.It was obvious that Bear Shield was a tanker.\u2014It was common knowledge in PvP that slow users weren't dangerous.'It looks like it's going to be easier than before.'They didn't even need to change the strategy.If they fought the same way, time would flow, and the quest's end would get closer.\"I want to use my ultimate attack.\"\u300cWhat?\u300dWhat was she talking about?It seemed like Ain had just said another nonsensical thing.They didn't even need to use her ultimate attack, so why would she waste it there?Ain's ultimate attack was strong, but since it had a 12-hour cooldown, she had to think very carefully before using it.Hyun tried to convince her.\u300cHey\u2026 I told you before. After clearing the quest, we should go hunt a named boss monster.\u300d\"Did you say that\u2026?\"\u300cYes, I did! If you use ultimate attack now, you won't be able to use it for hunting the named boss.\u300d\"But this seems more entertaining than that.\"Ain was determined to use her ultimate attack.Hyun's voice became more urgent.\u300cWait! Wait a little bit. You enjoy PvP, right? Wouldn't it be boring if the opponent was too weak?! Not using the ultimate attack will probably make things more fun\u2026\u300dFwoosh-Hyun was still speaking when intense red energy started to come out from Ain's body.Ain couldn't resist it and ended up using her awakening skill, \u00abPrepared for Extinction\u00bb.\u300cDamn\u2026!\u300dHyun couldn't stop Ain from covering her body with fire.Ears made of fire rose from her head, and at her back, you could see a red tail surging.It was the fire wolf figure she had been longing for.\"Hehehe\u2026\"Laughter leaked out from Ain's lips.She felt satisfied, except that there wasn't a mirror so that she could look at herself.After activating the ultimate attack, the level of \u00abFlame Claws\u00bb went up to Lv. 7 and evolved.Ain's ultimate attack also increased the level of fire-type skills by one.[\u00abEfret's Claw\u00bb Lv.5(+2)]After she activated the skill,\u00a0Crack-, the claws of a beast appeared from Ain's small hands.For some people, the sight of a claw with a length of one meter might have looked grotesque, but Ain even liked that.[HP: 22570/23120]The ultimate attack, \u00abPrepared for Extinction\u00bb, just as the name indicated, consumed 10 HP per second.That meant that she could die by just standing still\u2026 But because they had increased her HP thanks to the elixir, it probably didn't matter.Flap-!Ain began to move.From the perspective of others, it looked as if a giant ball of fire was moving.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 - Count\u2019s Quest (4)Ain's claws smashed Bear Shield and went through his body, which resulted in him melting down. Her claws got stuck on the ground.Tss-\u00a0The sound of the rock melting mixed with the smoke that came from the burned ground.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 7831 damage!]The afterimage of the flame that rose with the attack even swallowed the death light effect.Bear Shield, who should have been where Ain's claws were, couldn't be seen anywhere.\"One-hit KO...?\"Members of the Darkness Guild froze.They couldn't believe that Bear Shield, who boasted about having extreme tanking power, couldn't resist even a single hit.Not only that, but he had received some of the best defensive buffs.And yet, he was killed with one hit?They couldn't believe what had happened.But the nightmare wasn't over yet.Ain had just started using her ultimate attack.\"Don't get close to her!\"Even without that warning, the guild members were extremely cautious.They felt as if they were facing a monster.\u2014Especially those claws she had on both arms, they looked as if they belonged to a mythological creature.\"This is too much...\"A few had already lost their fighting spirit and were groaning.The toughest member of the guild, Bear Shield, had died without even being able to counter-attack.That meant that a simple touch would be enough to kill Magicians or Priests.\"This... Is a little unexpected.\"XL also dripped in a cold sweat.He thought they had a 50% chance to win based on her fight against the Myth Guild.But the opponent in front of them at that moment was on a whole other level.'It seems like she hadn't shown all her strength back then.'It was as if she had been playing against the Myth Guild\u2014how she fought and moved was completely different from before.To make things worse, there was the new skill she had shown them.Suddenly, her body had been covered in fire, and the damage she dealt went up to a ridiculous number.He didn't understand what she'd done, but without warning, claws grew up on her hands, and her attack range increased a lot.'We... Won't be able to dodge that.'It was just as XL guessed.Every time the opponent moved her claws, a trace of fire was created in a three-meter radius.Guild members that were brushed by the fire were killed before they could think of a way to counter it.\"Don't get close! Attack her from a distance!\"Vice-commander Reina, who still hadn't given up, tried her best to lead the fight.Magic spells, arrows, daggers\u2014they poured a lot of different kinds of attacks on her.But they soon discovered that their efforts were useless.Ting- Tiing-The giant flame claws blocked all the long-range attacks, and the projectiles bounced back ineffectually.A few ice spells melted down the moment they reached Ain.Smile-Ain's teeth showed a little bit.It was Hyun's smile showing up because of \u00abAssimilation\u00bb.Hyun and Ain had done a lot of research about \u00abEfret's Claw\u00bb.'It also works great as a defensive skill.'The claws, unlike the fire, were made of a material that resembled metal.Hyun remembered very clearly the fights during the awakening quests.The shadows had used the claws to cover themselves from attacks or had stuck them into the ground to resist knockbacks, and from that, he had guessed something.'Could it be that the claws have a physical body?'Hyun's guess was right.He had concluded that after doing several experiments. He didn't receive any damage from weak attacks.It was the same principle as having a new weapon, like a sword, equipped.Thanks to the skill evolving, the defensive options had increased.Tap- Tap-!Ain traversed on the side of the canyon from side to side and then jumped.The altitude allowed them to see the opponent's entire formation.They could see several Magicians gathered in the back and casting.Because there were a lot of reinforcing magic circles drawn on the ground, they could easily see where the Magicians were standing.\u300cBe careful.\u300d\"Don't worry.\"Because she had jumped, a lot of spells flew in her direction.It seemed like they thought that she wouldn't be able to change directions while in the air. The sight of multiple attacks launched simultaneously resembled a barrage of bullets.Smash-!As she swung her claws, all magics flying toward her disappeared just as if she had used an eraser.'Too annoying.'Ain slid along the cliff.As Ain approached where the Magicians were standing, she used the flexibility of her waist and smashed them with the claws.\"Damn!\" The Magicians who were being targeted cursed.They had figured out that they wouldn't be able to escape.And they were right. To begin with, the difference between their speed was too much.\"Everyone, gather under me!\" A Magician shouted while raising his wand.Crack-\u00a0A giant ice wall appeared in the sky.It was a defensive ultimate skill.It should have been able to block almost all attacks, but at that moment, that wasn't the case.The attack approaching them was the ultimate attack of the Close Range Magician that had the highest damage output.On top of that, there was the assistance of the hidden Support job.Smash-Both awakening skills crashed into each other.Ain's ultimate attack was stronger.The claws made of lava tore down the ice shield piece by piece.The Magicians that were under it weren't safe anymore.The four of them burned down and disappeared.\u300cHow dare you!\u300dHyun twisted her waist.At that moment, the flames shone while drawing a half-moon!Ain\u2019s claws changed direction and attacked the two thieves trying to launch a surprise attack.Even though the tips of the claws just brushed them, they still couldn't resist the incoming damage.Both became ashes and scattered away.Ain's movements were faster than the thieves\u2019, whose main stat was Agility.The trail of flames stirred the battlefield!* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Because Ain moved very fast in zigzag patterns, the Darkness Guild wasn\u2019t able to land attacks on her.\u300cWoah, be careful...!\u300dEven if they got the direction right, Hyun was able to react.Crash- A sharp metal pillar rose from underneath them, but it missed Ain by a narrow margin.The attack coming from the ground could stun the opponent.If Hyun hadn't been able to react, they could've been in a dangerous situation.Ain opened her mouth in surprise.\"How did you see that?\"\u300cIt's nothing.\u300dHyun had managed to dodge the attack, but he was surprised by the opponent.Was it because the opponent was a ranker? Their ability to adapt based on the situation was really fast.The claws couldn't block attacks that rose from underneath.As time went on, the opponents started to discover their weaknesses.'Who was it? Someone in that direction?'Hyun pointed to somewhere with his finger.Ain started to move to where her finger was pointing.\u300cShe's probably the one who launched the attack.\u300dThat was where Mayday, the person with the highest level among Darkness members, was standing.Mayday, the 2nd ranking player, was one of the first members of Darkness and the strongest Magician.\"Ugh...!\"After Ain suddenly pointed toward her with a creepy smile on her face, Mayday's heart sank.She wondered if the grim reaper would look like that.Mayday felt that Ain was trying to tell her that she would take her life.How had she managed to discover her attack?She shouldn't have used magic\u2014it had led to Ain discovering her position.Lots of different thoughts went through Mayday's head, but she was also a ranker.The average user would probably be in a panic state and would die without being able to do anything.\u00abThorns of Death\u00bb!With Mayday's gesture, tens of metal pieces flooded towards Ain.She casted one more spell.\u00abMetal Edge\u00bb!The two spells flew at the same time.The combo of Thorns of Death and Metal Edge was one Ain had frequently used.If you looked at the magic coming straight towards you, you would end up being hit by the one coming from below.If it were the first time seeing that combo, even a ranker would have problems dealing with it.\"Hehe...\"A smile appeared on Ain's mouth.Thanks to the casting effect, she knew what attacks were coming in her direction.She easily brushed off the incoming metal pieces with the claws.Flap- As she increased her speed, the metal piece rising from the ground also missed her.When Mayday grasped the situation, she felt something hot near her head.Smash-! The beast\u2019s giant claws melted Mayday's body.The Darkness Guild's strongest Magician and number 2 ranking player of the world, Mayday, had died.And with that, the quest clearly leaned toward one side.* * *The Gamez, thanks to the contract they had with NFM, could analyze the situation from a wide variety of angles.As soon as the Darkness Guild and the quest's boss began fighting against each other, commentator Im SeongJun started to talk as if he was rapping.Kim SooYong also added an explanation whenever something important happened.\"It's a very tight fight! The Darkness Guild is handling the situation well!\"\"Something interesting is that people from the Darkness Guild have sent only one damage dealer to the front. The rest are supporting him from a distance.\"\"Oh, co-commentator Kim SooYong, is that a good strategy?\"\"Yes, it is indeed. The reason is that the entrance is very narrow, so if there are a lot of damage dealers or tankers, rather than helping, they could become an obstacle.\"\"Oh, I see!\"\"The only weakness of this strategy is that if the damage dealer has worse specs than the opponent, they will be killed very easily, but I think they've overcome that weakness thanks to all the buffs they applied on him. As expected from Darkness.\"The battle that followed the explanation had everyone silent, including the commentators.\u2014Pias's amazing spear techniques.\u2014All the supporting skills from the other members of the Darkness Guild.\u2014And the fire that danced in the shadow priest's hands!The users that were used to the grinding aspect of RPG games couldn't hide their surprise because of the high-level fighting.\u2014Especially the close-range battle between Ain and Pias, which had pro gamers groaning in surprise.\"Amazing...\"JaeHoon couldn't help but admire what was happening while watching the broadcast alone in his house.JaeHoon, who had officially become a member of Stardust, was also very interested in the Count's quest.That was why JaeHoon, who had decided to concentrate on the incoming mid-term exams, was up late watching the internet broadcast.After hearing SeoHyun's words, he had decided to give up on the quest, but he couldn't help but think that he had lost a great opportunity.\"It wasn\u2019t for no reason that Hyun told me to give up on the quest...\"It didn't take long for JaeHoon to change his opinion.He was glad he had decided to listen to Hyun's warning.If Stardust had fought against that boss, the best outcome would have been to escape alive.Even Darkness, who had some of the best rankers, were struggling, so the outcome would be obvious even if they'd gathered a party to do the quest.\"There's a lot I can learn from this.\"JaeHoon was trapped by the screen of his smartphone.But his attention wasn't focused on the global ranking 9th player Pias\u2014he was more interested in the quest boss, who everyone thought was a dark priest.His, no. Probably her...?He felt that her movements were superior to Pias's.At first glance, the fight seemed even, but JaeHoon, with his sharp eyes, made a correct analysis of the situation.\"She's not only fighting the opponent in front of her, but she's also deflecting the arrows coming from a distance. How is she able to do that...?\"Even while fighting, she wasn't letting any long-range attacks come in her direction.Could she do that because she was an artificial intelligence?That would probably be plausible, but JaeHoon thought that wasn't the case.There were a lot of strategies she used that were aimed at affecting the opponent's psychology.That attitude was the opposite of artificial intelligence, which always tried to minimize the variables.JaeHoon even began thinking something like this:'Is she really an artificial intelligence? To me, she looks like a human.'Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 - Bifurcation (1)JaeHoon blinked.He felt like he was about to catch something important that he was missing.Unfortunately, the fight ended in an instant.Pias couldn't withstand the dark priest's attack and had died.You could hear the lamentations of the commentators Im SeongJun and Kim SooYong.\"How much damage does that fire do?

If they go back now, they won't be able to recover the costs to teleport!\"\"Bear Shield is famous for being one of the best tankers\u2026 But wait, what's that?!\"Kim SooYong noticed something while talking.The Dark Priest, who was standing still, suddenly began burning over her entire body and started to transform.Ears made of fire appeared on top of her head, and a tail grew at her back.Even though the black robe was covered in flames, it didn't burn.It was like seeing Efreet, the god of fire\u2026 It was as if she'd become the fire itself.\"Is that\u2026 A fox?\"Im SeongJoon couldn't describe the situation.The fox covered in a fire had used her claws to smash the opponent.In the place where Bear Shield should have been standing, they could only see the claws stuck in the ground. She had defeated the best tanker with just one hit!Both commentators, and all users watching the stream, remained silent for a while.Kim SooYoung, who was the first one who came back to his senses, began explaining the situation.\"So we have a problem\u2026 What should I say\u2026 Yes, so. Let's just say that the second phase has started. Just like a player saves up the ultimate attack or skill until the end, it seems like the boss had a hidden trump card.\"The next scene was more of a massacre than a fight.One Dark Priest moved across the formation of the Darkness Guild, and there seemed to be no way to stop her.Suddenly, the view of the screen changed.Thanks to the contract with NFM, viewers could watch the fight from a third and even first-person perspective\u2014it was as if they had a camera mounted on top of the Dark Priest's head.The screen was spinning at such a speed that it was dizzying.Im SeongJoon shouted with an excited voice.\"She jumped up! She's running through the cliff! Ugh, the Magicians were ambushed and ended up dying! They tried to defend, but she broke through their defense!\"\"Some thieves tried to attack from behind, but it was useless! It seems like nothing works against her. They need to stop her movements first, but the skills that cause abnormal status don't seem to be able to reach her.\"\"The difference between their speed is too much! Isn't there a curse or a skill that makes the opponent move slower?!\"\"Yes, there are debuff skills, but you can only learn them after you change jobs at level 100, which means that no one knows that type of skill yet!\"\"Ah, that's too bad! If they had done this quest after changing jobs, the result could've been different. But right now, there doesn't seem to be a good way to beat her! Oh?! This time the 2nd in the rankings, Mayday, was ambushed! Mayday! Mayday!\"\"Even if Mayday is a ranker, she's still a Magician. A Magician that hasn't changed jobs yet can't do anything without the protection of an ally. Oh, the moment I was explaining, Mayday was also killed.\"\"This is a big blow! Mayday has recently been leveling up pretty fast, and she was close to catching up to Lattice! After today's death, she won't be able to log in for two days, so the distance between them will increase again!\"\"Yes, that's too bad. Is the Darkness Guild going to give up? Oh, just as expected. It seems like they're withdrawing.\"* * *After the Darkness Guild retreated, Hyun and Ain also retired.If they chased them, they would've been able to kill them all, but they didn't.The old man's quest said they had to make sure people didn't enter the ruins, but it didn't say that you needed to kill all enemies.If they did that and someone took the chance to infiltrate, things could get bothersome.\"Oof\u2026 There were a lot today,\" Ain mumbled after dismissing her ultimate attack.\u300cYes, it seems like they've given up.\u300d\"There's no way they would be able to defeat us!\"\u300cWell, they're still newbies. after all.\u300dHyun looked at the timer of the quest.Was it because of the fight that time had passed so fast? There were only five minutes left before the quest ended.Soon, the four days time limit would end, and with that, the old man\u2019s quest would come to an end.But of course, Hyun didn't intend to end the quest so easily.'Should I start moving?'A suspicious old man's request.The old man had warned them not to go inside the ruins while the quest was still ongoing.According to the information Hyun knew, there were two ways to clear the quest.\u2014The first one was listening to the old man, protecting the ruin\u2019s entrance, and getting a few rewards.\u2014The second one was to ignore the old man's warnings and enter the ruin.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *'I should meet him a few seconds before the quest ends.'However, the time at which they faced the old man was very important.If they went to meet him too soon, they would die without being able to offer resistance against his magic.That's why they had to face him just before the quest ended. Near the end, he wouldn't have that much strength, so they should be able to clear the quest safely.Right then was the only moment they had.\"Where are we going?\" Ain asked anxiously as her body walked toward the inside of the ruin.\u300cDon't worry about it, just trust me.\u300d\"Hmm\u2026? Too Suspicious\u2026\"Ain was curious about what Hyun wanted to do, but she decided to let her do as he wished.Inside the ruins, there was a staircase leading to an underground level. Hyun went down without hesitating.The staircase was deep, and it was wet.As they went down, they started to feel a chill.\"Cold\u2026!\" Ain said while crossing her arms.She tried to warm up her body with flames, but Hyun canceled it.Hyun still had control priority.\"What?! Why did you put out the fire?!\"\u300cI'm sorry\u2026 But please, be patient.\u300d\"Ugh\u2026 Okay, but just for a little bit\u2026!\"Ain kept complaining, but she didn't try to sabotage Hyun.He felt sorry, but there was nothing he could do about it.Even if the elixir's effect were still active, her mana would quickly dry up if she used her flames to warm up.As they approached the end of the staircase, the cold became stronger.It seemed like Ain felt some goosebumps since she shrugged her body.At the end of the staircase, there was an unknown magic circle, and in the center of it stood the old man.There was a bright light that seemed to devour everything around it!The light coming from the magic circle was connected to the sky.\"Hahaha, finally it's complete! My body is absorbing the heavenly light!\"The old man didn't notice that someone was approaching.He only turned around after hearing some footsteps right at his back.They could see the madness in his eyes.\"What are you doing\u2026?! Didn't I say to guard the entrance of the ruin?!\"The old man looked at them while frowning as if he was about to devour them.It was the look of someone that was about to commit a murder.But soon, the tone of his voice changed.It seemed like he was trying to convince them.\"Okay, I'll give you 10 skill points as a reward\u2026 Why don't you go back to the ruin's entrance and make sure no one comes through it?\"10 skill points!Getting extra skill points had more value than leveling up.As your level went up, the need for more skill points increased.But Hyun wasn't tempted by that.He looked at the time limit. There were 20 seconds left.'Now should be okay, right?'Hyun smiled at the old man with a mischievous smile.As they walked inside the magic circle, intense cold energy began to run around them.\"Stop right now!\"The old man shouted at them, but Hyun just laughed while groaning.\"I'm sorry, grandpa\u2026\"Ain's voice had an unpleasant stickiness mixed, unlike her usual tone.Hyun had used Ain's body to speak.Unlike her usual tone of voice, it was a little bit darker.\"Back off!\"Fwoosh- Hyun ignored the old man's warning and covered Ain's hands with fire.The old man threatened them with retaliation if they didn't move away.But at that moment, there wasn't anything that the old man could do.To make his plan successful, he had used almost all of his strength.There wasn't that much time left! Just a few seconds and he would achieve his goal\u2026!\"You damn brat!\"While the old man was shouting, Ain hit him with fire, but the flames only stirred the air.\"Did he escape\u2026?\"Ain's eyes narrowed.It seemed like he had used teleportation magic to escape.'What about the time\u2026?'Hyun checked out the quest\u2019s status window.The hidden quest\u2019s remaining time had stopped at five seconds, and it wasn't going down.The beam of light that seemed to be about to pierce the sky had started to calm down.\"Ah\u2026\"Ain was looking up with her mouth opened.Beautiful crystals were shining and floating in the air where the beam of light had been.Ain tried to get closer to the crystal, which resembled broken jewelry pieces.\"Ugh\u2026\"She groaned and flinched.As she started to get closer, she began to feel a cold at the tip of her hands that hurt as if it was trying to tear her skin apart.Ain tried to pull her hand away, but Hyun didn't let her.He had the control priority.He moved her hands closer and closer to the crystal and then grabbed it.Crackle-!They felt as if their body was hit with an electric shock as they held it.As the crystals permeated Ain's body, a message appeared in front of them.[A force that was within the heavenly crystal has entered your body!][You've obtained the title 'Heavenly Being!']'Yes\u2026!'Hyun cried out for joy.That had been his goal since the moment they got the quest.He had finally achieved it.The message didn't end there and kept going for a little longer.[You're the first user to obtain the title 'Heavenly Being'!][Oh, but what happened?! There are two souls in a single vessel!][Both souls have obtained the title of Heavenly Being!]<From some point in time, humans began admiring the people that came down from the skies, and they started calling them 'Heavenly Beings.'><Title: Heavenly Being>[Your resistance to the cold has permanently increased by 50%!][Your resistance to thunder has permanently increased by 50%!][You don't feel cold anymore!][And maybe something special will happen?]\"Oh\u2026?\"From Ain's mouth, a sizzling sound came out.The cold she had been feeling for a while had suddenly disappeared.\u2014And it was all thanks to the title she had just obtained.\"Fu\u2026 Hehe\u2026 Haha. Hahaha!\"Ain suddenly burst into laughter like a crazy person.Hyun's laugh was coming out through Ain's mouth and voice.Ugh\u2026! He was so happy that he rolled on the ground, but Ain's body ended up hitting a column.And then he started laughing again.Ain wanted to stop his ridiculous behavior, but she couldn't do anything since Hyun had control priority.\"Please stop doing weird things with my body\u2026\"Even after Ain asked him, Hyun kept laughing and rolling on the ground for a while.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 - Bifurcation (2)The damage the Darkness Guild had received was huge.Half of its members had died, and among those, there were the rankers that the guild was so proud of.Pias, Bear Shield, and even the one they were most proud about, Mayday, had all died.\"I was too careless.\"The leader of the guild, XL, let out a sigh.Since they were still at the early stages of the game, new powerful guilds appeared all the time.Even after receiving a fatal blow, they hadn't obtained anything, so their crown was at risk.Ting-!XL was starting to feel hopeless when the notification window popped out.[You've cleared the quest!]\"Huh?!\"XL stood up at the unexpected notification.What had happened?They hadn't been able to pass through the entrance. Not only that, but they had retreated before the enemy annihilated all of them.Then\u2026 what was that clear message?XL started to read the message received from the system.[The rewards are going to be distributed based on contribution!]1 - Mayday's Party (Contribution Rate: 4%)2 - Bear Shield's Party (Contribution Rate: 1%)3 - Pias's Party (Contribution Rate: 0.2%)\"Huh, what\u2019s happening?\"Reina, who had become a mess while escaping from the enemy, asked, confused.No, most members of Darkness just blankly stared at the quest's clear message.They didn't understand how it happened, but the quest was clear!They had successfully cleared the quest because Hyun and Ain had killed the old man, but the members of the Darkness Guild had no way of knowing that.\"What happened? Did another guild come after us and successfully clear the quest?\"\"Are you stupid? There's no way that happened. There were only five minutes left before the quest ended.\"\"Look! The skill points have increased!\" Said one of the people that were in charge of long-range attacks in Mayday's party.\"I'll finally be able to upgrade my Energy Ball! Haha, although I don't get it!\"\"But how did the quest get cleared\u2026?\"\"Yeah, right?\"They were sure they had failed the quest, but somehow it ended up being cleared.Members of Darkness went through the video many times, yet they couldn't find the answer.After 48 hours passed, they asked Pias, Bear Shield, and Mayday, but they reacted the same way.\"Huh?! We cleared the quest? Didn't we fail?!\"\"Oh! I leveled up!\"\"There's a weird item inside my inventory! What's this? The Sword of the Sun\u2026?\"They thought about it for a while, but no one could find an answer to the question.* * *\u2014After the Count's quest ended.As soon as The Gamez ended the show, they uploaded the footage to YouTube.The views of that video exploded as if it were the new music video of an idol group.A few hours later, the video had subtitles from all kinds of languages.<1st ranking Darkness guild, completely defeated! Are they going to lose their crown?!><South Korea's pride 'Myth' destroyed!>All gaming communities were full of news related to what had just happened.[Since when is the Myth Guild the pride of Korea?

The Dark Priest isn't usually that strong. She probably has received some kind of buff, or she already completed the second job ascension.\u300d\u300cThe person above me is a level 50+ Priest\u300d\u300cWhat a snake oil salesman, lol\u300d\u300cNo, I'm the world ranking 582 player, a level 65 Warrior. I was also an Asra Online player\u300d\u300cYeah, sure, and I'm Lattice\u300d\"What's wrong with these people? Talking with them is impossible, damn it.\"'Steel Rock' was the ranking 582, level 65 Warrior. At the same time, he had three years of experience playing Asra Online.He grabbed his throbbing head while browsing the online communities at his home.After discussing it with them for a while, he discovered that making them change their opinion based on logic and reasoning was impossible.In the internet world, where users could remain anonymous, everyone and their brother was a ranker.He decided to stop wasting his time on such meaningless tasks.Steel Rock began watching that video once more.He focused his attention on the Dark Priest.Everyone had said that she was a Dark Priest, but he wasn't so sure about it.The skills and robes she used were very similar to those of a Dark Priest, but there were too many strange things that made him doubt.\"The damage output is too high, and her movements are too quick.\"And also, among the skills of the Dark Priest, there wasn't one that consisted of a giant claw.Of course, there was a possibility that she had learned a skill that wasn't among the default ones, but he had a feeling that she wasn't a Dark Priest.\"Hmm\u2026 She's good.\"Steel Rock was amazed by what he saw in the video.It didn't matter how many times he had seen it\u2014her movements were almost like a piece of art.Watching her slaughter the opponents made him feel cathartic.Suddenly, he felt a sense of D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\"What's\u2026?\"Her movements felt familiar.Was it because he had seen the same video over and over again?No, it wasn't that.He felt as if he'd seen those movements before.He couldn't get rid of the tickling sensation in his head.He concentrated on the screen a little bit more.The girl used the giant claws to slice the members of Darkness.At that moment, he felt a thunder inside his head.\"Wait, don't tell me\u2026?!\"While trying to hold his breath, Steel Rock opened the 'Asra' folder and started looking through old videos.Steel Rock had made a habit of recording his gameplay videos all the way from when he played Asra Online.And among those videos, there were some in which he had formed a party with famous people or fought against them.\"No way\u2026 Really?\"He compared both videos side by side.One was the Dark Priest, and the other one a werewolf.For a moment, both steps matched perfectly for almost three seconds.It was a unique way of moving that had feints mixed in.Only one person moved in such a unique way in either Asra Online or even Asrian.He felt as if the thread that had been entangled in his head was unraveling.\"Ain?\"And then another question came to mind.\"Why is Ain a girl\u2026?\"He watched closely and then shook his head.\"No, maybe that's not a female character.\"Since Asrian Online was a virtual reality game, you couldn't change the character's gender, but you could customize it as you wished.Maybe that was Ain, who was a boy with long hair\u2026\"Oof, I have no idea!\"Then he started to doubt himself. Maybe his previous conclusion was wrong?To get another opinion, he logged in to Asrian Online and looked out for someone.\u2014Level 66 Thief, Berard. He was also an Asra Online veteran with four years of experience.\u300cDidn't you tell me that you were going to get some rest?\u300dAs soon as Steel Rock logged in, Berard sent him a message.\u300cWell, it seems like you were also motivated by the video. Did you just see the video of Ain running wild?\u300d\u300cWhat?\u300dSteel Rock was surprised at what Berard had just told him.He thought that he had discovered that thanks to how sharp he was, but Berard had just said what he had guessed as if it were nothing.And unlike him, he seemed confident about the Dark Priest's identity.\u300cYou also knew about it? No, is that really Ain\u2026?!\u300d\u300cWhat are you talking about\u2026? Say one thing at a time.\u300dAfter Steel Rock had calmed down, Berard started to explain.\u300cOf course. There's no way I wouldn't recognize Ain. She defeated me in PvP countless times\u2026 That's why I remember all of her movements. The moment I saw that live stream, I knew she was Ain.\u300d\u300cBut this is ridiculous. Was Ain a girl? I thought Ain was a rough berserker.\u300d\u300cWhy are you so surprised? Why couldn't Ain be a girl? But that's not the problem here.\u300dBerard lowered his tone of voice.\u300cAll former top rankers in Asra Online are growing at an extremely fast pace, even here. It isn't just Ain. A couple more people I knew are also growing very fast.\u300d\u300cWell, that's expected\u2026\u300d\u300cNo, they're growing faster than what you're imagining. In this game, the information you have can help you grow way faster than you think.\u300dBerard's words were quite credible. After all, he was once ranked 5th in Asra Online.Since Steel Rock couldn't break into the top 30, he listened carefully to what Berard said.\u300cAin probably started playing at the same time with us, but right now, she's incredibly strong. What do you think that means?\u300dEven in Asra Online, Ain was one of the players whose rankings varied a lot.One day, she would be pushed out of the top 10, but on another day, she would suddenly reach 2nd place in the rankings.That meant that, although she didn't log in frequently, she could always reach 2nd place in the rankings if she wished to.Especially in PvP\u2014everyone who played Asra Online agreed that she was by far the strongest at duels.But in Asra Online, there was someone more famous than Ain.\u2014Someone who had kept the number one position for many years.That name came out of Berard's mouth.\u300cIf 'Hyun' started playing Asrian Online, how strong do you think he would be?\u300d\u300cHyun\u2026?\u300dSteel Rock suddenly felt goosebumps.The overwhelming 1st place in the rankings, Hyun.It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that he was unrivaled.It would be too simple to say that he was good at controlling the character\u2026He was simply the best at playing.His gaming sense was simply different from other people.No one understood why someone like him played a game like Asra Online.He had forgotten about him because his name didn't appear in the hall of fame.\u300cIs he also playing Asrian?\u300d\u300cI'm sure he is.\u300d\u300cBut his name isn't in the hall of fame?\u300d\u300cYou idiot, he just didn't register in the hall of fame! Ain also doesn't appear in it.\u300dBerard hadn't finished talking yet.\u300cIf Hyun and Ain met\u2026 Can you imagine what would happen?\u300dSteel Rock couldn't close his mouth for a while.When he thought about it, he remembered that they often hung out together.To be more precise, Ain followed Hyun around and asked him to duel her. Although they had formed a party to hunt or complete quests from time to time.Remembering how they cleared seemingly impossible quests gave him goosebumps.\u300cAlthough it seems they're playing separately for the moment.\u300d\u300cLet's go hunting.\u300dSteel Rock suddenly mumbled.Berard started laughing.\u300cYeah. We also need to grow faster, right?\u300dBerard and Steel Rock began preparations for hunting.There wasn't time to rest if they didn't want to suffer the same humiliation from the previous game.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 - The Aftermath of a Commotion (1)The Stardust guild house.Since professional gamers had devoted their lives to gaming, analyzing information and learning the most recent meta was part of their job\u2014that's why the Count's quest was a hot topic among players.\"Did you see that video?\"\"Oh, the one from yesterday! I've seen it, of course.\"At first, professional gamers tried to analyze the Dark Priest's movements, but they soon found difficulties.\"How does she do this?\"One of the members pointed out something about her movements.Even while fighting against an opponent, she had avoided long-ranged attacks.How she fought against the opponent in front of her and dodged the arrows from behind was mysterious.\"Is this level of multitasking possible for a human being?\"The truth was that it was the result of Hyun and Ain working together.Thanks to \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, they were able to both control one body.They were able to do that because they divided the roles, but from an outsider's point of view, it looked as if a single person was doing all that.Later on, it looked as if she was avoiding all attacks subconsciously.\"It doesn't matter how you look at it\u2026 She's not a human.\"\"Since it's an NPC, she's an artificial intelligence, right? Those don't seem like the movements of a human being in the first place.\"\"I also think the same. I don't think moving like that is possible, even with multiple brains.\"\"It looks programmed.\"People were certain about it after looking at a particular scene.The Dark Priest, while fighting an opponent, suddenly dodged an attack that came from underneath by throwing her body to the side.Even while dodging the attack, she didn't look at the ground even once.Dodging an attack coming from a blind spot based on intuition?But those kinds of things didn't happen once or twice\u2014she did it tens of times, so it was logically impossible.\"Even if you try to learn from the movements of a machine, you won't get any better. It's preferable to study the movements of a real player.\"\"Yeah\u2026 There doesn't seem to be anything we can learn from it. This looks like a useless video for us.\"Most pro-gamers seemed to conclude that.The only one who objected was the one who had just joined Stardust, JaeHoon.\"Maybe it's because I don't have that much experience\u2026 But don't her movements resemble those of a human? Especially how she uses psychological warfare.\"\"JaeHoon, you're saying that because you don't know professional gamers that well yet.\" The one in charge of commenting on the video on the Gamez, Kim SooYong, replied to JaeHoon\u2019s question.He was someone who had won a tournament of a MOBA game before, so he was a veteran among veterans.\"When you're a professional, you get a grasp on what the limit of a human being is. For example, if a track and field runner starts running 0.1 seconds after the gun fires, he will be disqualified immediately. Why? Because that is known as the limit to the reaction speed of a human being\u2026 It's the same for multitasking. There isn't that much of a difference in the abilities among top players, but that Dark Priest is at least twice as strong as the opponents\u2014that means that it\u2019s beyond human capabilities.\"There was some credibility in the words of someone that had been a professional gamer for many years.'It looks weird, no matter how much I look at it.'Even at his house, JaeHoon watched the video repeatedly.He understood what \u2018beyond human capabilities\u2019 meant\u2026But he still felt that he was missing something.'They said that there wasn't that much difference between an Asrian NPC and real human beings\u2026 Can we conclude so easily that she's a machine?'He watched the video over and over again.'Ah\u2026!'After watching the video repeatedly, he noticed something he hadn't before.\u2014How the Dark Priest moved while attacking and defending was completely different.He had reached a hypothesis after watching the same video for many hours.'Maybe\u2026 I can divide their movements into two patterns!'From then onwards, JaeHoon started to analyze the video.From time to time, he wrote things on paper.Every time he got a new clue, he felt a sense of accomplishment similar to when he was able to solve a difficult math problem.'Just as I thought, there were two patterns mixed!'At first, he thought of separating attack and defense, but then he discovered that wasn't it.Close range and long-distance\u2026That's how the movements were divided.Once he got a clearer image, he became sure of it.'These are definitely the movements of a human! I didn't notice it at first because of the mixed patterns!'Then he tried to analyze the reasoning behind each movement.\u2014Why did she move in a zigzag here?\u2014Why is she moving back and forth?He couldn't understand everything at once, but he tried to understand the movements of the video step by step.'I should try to copy the close-range moves first.'JaeHoon immediately logged into Asrian.He tried to copy the movements the Dark Priest had used to pressure the opponents.It still looked a bit sloppy, but his movements started to resemble Ain's.'I'll have to use it in an actual battle to know if it's effective or not.'The midterm exams were approaching, but JaeHoon began studying something completely different.He wondered how he could use the movements he had been practicing so much. Even while walking, he had been image training.Every time the other members had time, he asked for a duel.He also participated in a small dueling group that took place in large city squares.But in the end, he spent most of his time alone practicing with his sword.After three days, JaeHoon began getting a grasp on how to move.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Stardust divided players into a first and second division.On paper, you could only get better by fighting people on a similar level as you, but to receive full-fledged support from the team, you needed to advance to the first division.It was the day when Stardust's performance evaluation took place.The rules were simple:1st and 2nd division users that have the same job fight against each other.The one that wins either gets to keep the position or loses it!JaeHoon, who had entered the team a few days prior, was in the 2nd division.JaeHoon had chosen 'Practice' as his nickname.JaeHoon, 'Practice', had to fight a user from the 1st division nicknamed 'Rain.'Even among the first division members, he was within the top three. Not only that, but because of how much effort he had put in, he was growing very fast.\"Rain is definitely going to become someone important.\"The gaming team's physical trainer always spoke highly of Rain.The trainer always emphasized that athleticism was more important than most in-game things.The reason was that Asrian was the closest game to real life, which meant that you could apply knowledge from different martial arts inside the game.\"You should all try and learn from this guy. It's okay to focus on gaming, but if you only do that, you won't be able to pass beyond a certain level. Asrian is a game that has sensory synchronization. If you lack athleticism, you'll eventually get left behind.\"After Asrian had launched, Rain had spent every day learning different martial arts.Even after finishing gaming sessions, he always spent at least three hours doing physical training.While other players were busy finding good skill combinations, Rain didn't ignore the importance of modern martial arts.\"I'm looking forward to the match.\"\"Oh, yeah. You're the new guy who joined a few days ago, right? I'm also looking forward to the match.\"Practice and Rain starred at each other at the Stardust Guild's practice range.The match took place in front of all players, coaches, the head coach, and even the trainers.'Is that guy going to be okay?'Most people were sure that Practice, who hadn't received any training, would for sure lose against Rain.It was true that Rain had started learning martial arts only three months beforehand, but the difference between someone who hadn't learned anything and one who had was bigger than expected.'I hope he doesn't get crushed and lose his confidence.'[A friendly duel is about to start.][5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Start!]Both players used a sword as their weapon of choice.Rain used the Chudan no Kamae, which was the basic posture of Kendo. Practice, on the other hand, was just standing while his sword was touching the floor.Oof, the swordsmanship trainer was feeling a headache at the sight in front of him.Chudan no Kamae\u2026It was just a Kendo posture that consisted of pointing your sword to the front, but one couldn't simply ignore its effectiveness.That's because it reduces the distance between the attacker and defender.Having your sword pointing to the ground was like asking the opponent to hit you.The truth was that Practice had never taken kendo lessons.His stance didn't come from kendo theory; he was trying to copy the Dark Priest.He had modified them so that they would suit him.Practice attacked first.It was a simple stab.But at that moment, something that no one was expecting happened.Stab-!\u00a0Practice's sword penetrated Rain's body.Not only that, but his stab didn't immediately end.What impressed everyone was that Rain couldn't block Practice\u2019s attack even once.\"What?!\"The swordsmanship trainer\u2019s eyes widened.After years of training, he had achieved a 6th degree in Kendo, but even he couldn't understand what was happening.Everyone was expecting Practice to be overwhelmed by Rain, but the opposite was happening.Since he had personally trained Rain, he knew he wasn't someone who would lose against a newbie.That's why he couldn't believe what was happening in front of him.'How can he neutralize the Chudan no Kamae so easily?'Clang-!While he was thinking, Practice's sword damaged Rain again.Even though Rain solely focused on defense, he couldn't block Practice's attacks.With one attack pattern, Practice was completely overwhelming Rain.What combination are you using\u2026?The swordsmanship trainer looked with his eyes wide-opened.\"Oh\u2026!\"After watching Practice's movements carefully many times, he finally found the answer.\u2014It wasn't a simple stab.While stabbing, it changed directions as if it was lightning!Practice's sword had changed direction twice.'Changing the direction of the attack while in the middle of an attack?!'That certainly wasn't a kendo move.If someone tried to copy that move in real life, he would probably end up with his wrist broken.But they were in Asrian!It was a world where strength and agility stats dictated your power and speed.Even though Practice didn't know anything about martial arts, he overwhelmed Rain with the game's mechanisms.'Did he come up with those moves by himself\u2026?'Stab-! Practice's sword once again hit Rain.Rain tried his best to maintain the Chudan no Kamae, but he just couldn't block the incoming attacks.\u2014Changing the direction twice while attacking.It looked simple, but in reality, it wasn't.For that attack to be successful, you needed to coordinate the movements of your wrist and steps perfectly.The swordsmanship trainer could see the hidden effort behind Practice's movements.\u2018Yes, it wasn't something he came up with on the spot\u2026 He has probably been practicing this for the past few days\u2026 No, maybe weeks! It\u2019s definitely the result of practicing for a long period of time.\u2019'I see! How he pointed the sword down to the ground was also something he had planned before!'Practice made the attack's path the longest possible by lowering the sword.If the speed of your attack is faster than what a human can react to, it doesn't matter if the path of the attack is longer or shorter.If that\u2019s the case, the best position is the one that allows you to change posture easily.It wasn't something you could come up with from modern swordsmanship.'Is he a genius\u2026?'The swordsmanship trainer felt a chill go through his body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 - The Aftermath of a Commotion (2)After Rain's HP dropped to less than a third, he decided to shift his strategy.He finally dropped the Chudan no Kamae and tried other movements.He tried Weaving\u2014a way of constantly moving your body from left to right that had started with boxing.\u2014It was also the most effective way to avoid being stabbed.It was often used in boxing to dodge straights or jabs.\u2018While weaving, be careful of attacks coming from the sides.\u2019Rain remembered the words of the boxing trainer.Dodging your opponent by moving from left to right exposes you to potentially being slashed.Practice was probably going to try a slashing technique next.He just had to wait for that moment and counter-attack\u2014he probably still had a chance to win if he did that.'Is that a boxing move...?'Practice gulped while watching Rain, who was stepping left and right.It was almost impossible to stab someone who was moving like that.'But this is the only technique that I was able to learn.'Again, Practice broke through weaving in a way no one had thought.Stab-! Suddenly, Practice stabbed Rain with his sword from the side.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 210 damage!]'Ah...!'That time, it wasn't just the trainers that were surprised. Everyone else was amazed as well.Because you moved your upper body from side to side while weaving, you'd be hit without a doubt if someone stabbed you from the side.It was a solution anyone could've thought of, but nobody had tried.In real life, moving to the opponent's side would take you at least half a second.On a professional level, it was enough time for people to react.But in Asrian Online, people moved faster, so 0.2~0.3 seconds was enough to move to the opponent's side and stab him.It was all an illusion of the mind.Most users subconsciously assimilated their game avatar with their real-life bodies.'How can you maintain your balance while changing directions so fast? Just how much did you practice...!'Even if anyone could do it, it wasn't something anyone could easily do.The reason was that moving your character faster than your cognition required you to put in a lot of hours.'The difference between game and reality...'The trainers groaned.Because it was the first game with sensory synchronization, they had mistaken the game for real life.The bodies in Asrian Online were faster and more resistant than those in real life.Just as the lion fought by biting with its teeth and not just with its paws, users in Asrian Online had to learn other ways of fighting that were completely different from real life.But when you didn't know anything about the game, you had to rely on what you already knew\u2014basically, modern martial arts.To pass to the next stage, you had to learn how to walk again.\u2014A completely different body.Practice had just become the first one to stand up and walk.While everyone else was in shock, Rain couldn't resist anymore and fell to Practice's sword.That day, Practice moved up to the 1st division.* * *Darkness Guild.It had been two days since the Count's quest had finished, but there was still something they hadn't found the answer to.On that day, the guild couldn't step inside the ruin\u2026 Then why did the quest end in success?The guild leader, XL, pondered about that for a while.'There must be something.'XL was looking at that day's footage.Because the guild had been at risk, he hadn\u2019t had enough time to think about different things at that moment, but because he was looking at the footage again, he noticed many weird things.'Why doesn't the contribution rate add up to 100%?'[The rewards are going to be distributed based on the contribution!]1 - Mayday's Party (Contribution Rate: 4%)2 - Bear Shield's Party (Contribution Rate: 1%)3 - Pias's Party (Contribution Rate: 0.2%)In the system log, there was that message.The contribution rate was decided by taking into account lots of different metrics.Damage dealt, tanking, abnormal status skills successfully applied, etc.But the thing was that the sum of the contributions must result in 100%.\u2014Even if an NPC was involved in it.Because the contribution rate was solely based on a user's participation, the result of adding all the different contribution rates didn't change.Then had there been a bug in the system?XL was struggling because he couldn't find an answer to the inconsistency when\u2026'Wait... A user's contribution?'XL stood up.He discovered that he had brushed away another possibility.He hurriedly watched the recorded footage again.\u2014A Dark Priest wearing an all-black robe.In most online communities, people had concluded that she was an NPC.But people who analyzed the video had only seen the broadcasted footage; they hadn\u2019t been present there to feel the atmosphere.XL still remembered the confrontation with the Dark Priest.The movements of the Dark Priest, who seemed to know the game's mechanisms perfectly...To be honest, XL couldn't believe that an NPC moved in such ways.'If she isn't an NPC...!'The weird contribution rate, how the dark priest moved...If he changed all the assumptions, things became clearer.'She's a user!'She was probably a user that didn't get the Count's quest.That was the only possible explanation for why the contribution rate didn't add up to 100%.The moment he discovered the hidden truth, cold sweat dripped from XL's back.A user that hadn't registered in the hall of fame... She was definitely a ranker!After grasping the overall situation, he worked on the details.'How can she be that strong?'If he assumed that the Dark Priest was a user, another question arose.While facing the Darkness Guild by herself, she wasn't pushed back. Instead, she had completely overwhelmed them.Her HP, and the damage she dealt, were beyond the specs of a user.'Did she receive help from the quest?'Some quests had the format of an event and increased your specs for a short period of time.XL wasn't completely wrong.Thanks to the Heaven's Elixir, she could keep fighting for tens of minutes without batting an eye, so it wouldn't be completely wrong to say that she had received help from the quest.Were those giant flames really one of the skills of the Dark Priest, which was one of the available jobs for a Priest to transfer to?If that were the case, that would be a great shock.Even Lattice, the 1st ranker in the hall of fame, hadn't reached level 100 yet. The fact that there was a user that had already transferred jobs was hard to believe.'No, it's a hidden job!'XL's thoughts flashed again.He suddenly remembered the 'Two Person, Named Monster Clear' video.Even at that moment, when Asrian had just recently opened its doors, she was using the same skills.She couldn't have surpassed level 100 back then, so the only possible answer was that she had a hidden job.A ranker with a hidden job\u2026Then there was a chance that she had previously been an Asra Online user.It should've been almost impossible to get a hidden job without the previous game's information.'What should I do about this...?'XL decided to tell that information only to a few select people and keep it a secret from the rest.Even if she had received help from the quest, it still didn't change the fact that she had defeated them alone.If this became widely spread, their image as the number one guild would be completely ruined.XL decided to tell just a few people what he had just discovered.\u2014Vice leader Meia and rankers Mayday, Bear Shield, and Pias.Those who listened to what happened that day were just those five people.\"She's... A user?\"The members that listened to XL's explanation were horrified.They couldn't believe what they were hearing.But as XL explained to them point by point, they couldn't say anything against his arguments.As they kept hearing the explanation, things got clearer.It didn't take them long to understand the situation and be shocked by it.\"I can't believe she's a user...\"\"But he said that she probably became strong thanks to the quest.\"\"How strong do you think she is compared to Lattice?\"\"The only thing we're sure of is that, unlike Lattice, we can try to make her join us!\"\"Then this should be the perfect opportunity to do it since nobody knows that she's a user yet.\"After understanding the situation, they became sure about something.She was definitely a ranker that had a hidden job!They couldn\u2019t let her go!And that was how making a single user join their ranks became the Darkness Guild's number one priority.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The weekend.SeoHyun, who had just woken up from oversleeping, ate ramen while browsing through the community boards.People in the community boards were mainly talking about two things.The first thing was the Count's Quest that had been broadcasted through The Gamez.Among the topics discussed, there were things related to him and Ain.Hyun laughed at the comments in the popular threads.It seemed like most people thought that they were NPCs that had the 'Dark Priest' job.\"I guess they can think that since the skills are unique.\"He didn't hate people getting the wrong idea.Rather than hating it, he liked that the attention wasn't centered on them.And then the second hot topic\u2026NFM had announced an update for Asrian for the first time!Because there hadn't been any announcement for the last three months, people were excited at the news.<Asrian Content Update!>- We have good news for everyone that loves Asrian Online! In four days, the story of Asrian officially begins! You'll be able to check the details in the announcements inside the game!- We're adding the battle arena content today! You'll be able to access it in any mid or large-scale city!All battle arenas are connected through virtual networks, so you can meet users from other countries!\"So Asrian is going to start for real now...\"To be honest, he felt that Asrian had been a little bit bland up until then.There hadn't been anything interesting to do except for a few important hidden quests or named monster hunting.Of course, it wasn't like playing was boring, but compared to the previous game, it was a little bit lackluster in terms of content.A story that progresses according to the flow of time\u2026Well-elaborated stories that didn't lack even if compared to real life\u2026That was the content Hyun had enjoyed the most in Asra and what made him play that game so much.\"The battle arena opened as well.\"Ain was probably very excited at that news.After all, in Asra Online, she used to be stuck to it.He wasn't particularly interested in duels, so he wasn't very excited about it.\"In four days...\"Once the patch landed, things would get busy.A lot of content would be added after the patch, so there would be a lot of things he needed to do.<You have 1 new message!>Hyun saw he had an unread capsule message when he logged into Asrian.He had blocked all spam messages, so there was probably only one person who could contact him.That someone was Ain.- I don't think I'll be able to log in temporarily.

So Ain isn't going to be here for a couple of days.\u2018It was rare for her to rest from the game.Ain\u2019s absence was huge for him since he was a Support.After reading that she wouldn't log in, he felt his heart drop for a moment, but he soon calmed down.\"It's good that there aren't many things to do yet\u2026\"It was a good thing that she had chosen right then to be absent.Once the main story began, they had to be the ones at the forefront.Hyun was horrified at what would happen if she wasn't there.'I should take this opportunity to finish the mundane tasks I haven't done yet.'Hyun was thinking about what he had to do alone when he remembered something\u2026There was something he had pushed back.[ <Quest: Awakening Experience> ]- Your soul has been reborn anew!- You have a special job. If you go to the 'Twilight Temple' you might be able to learn new things about it!In Asrian, there were quests designed to help people with either a new job or special skills.Basically, it was a level 50 tutorial.It was a quest that didn't give you any rewards, so nothing changed whether he did it or not.Many users didn't do it at all since\u2014according to them\u2014it was a waste of time.'I don't think that I need a tutorial.'After reaching first place in Asra, he had never done a tutorial.That was because he thought his way of doing things was the best.He hadn't given up on the quest because his job wasn't a normal one.'Maybe the tutorial quest of a hidden class is different.'He thought so because of the last paragraph.The quest asked him to go to the 'Twilight Temple.'Usually, tutorial quests didn't ask you to go to a determined place.Hyun didn't even miss a little clue.'Well, I don't have anything else to do\u2026 So it should be okay to burn some free time.'Hyun teleported to a city located on the periphery.* * *The Twilight Temple.Even Hyun wasn't familiar with the place.The fact Hyun didn't remember anything about it meant that it wasn't an important place in the game's story\u2014it was basically just another temple of the many that existed in the game.'Is it this way?'The Twilight Temple was located in a forest that wasn't frequented by many people.He followed a long, straight road.The road to the temple had an oriental atmosphere.Was there a temple at the end of the road? Or maybe a shrine?With Hyun's knowledge, it was impossible to tell the difference between the two.Small decorative columns were placed in rows on both sides of the road.A thin rope connected the pillars. And on each rope, there hung a lamp.Hyun turned around.The same scene was repeated in front and behind him.It was as if he was trapped in an endless straight line.Since the scenery around didn't change, Hyun felt as if he was trapped in a maze.'What a weird place.'While walking, he felt like he was stepping into another world.He kept walking.The scenery began changing after he had walked for approximately 10 minutes.There was a small shrine on top of a small hill in front of him.\u2014That place was the Twilight Temple.\"Oh\u2026 A guest?\"A person leaning against the temple entrance noticed Hyun and looked at him with her eyes wide-opened.\"Oh, you're a user! Welcome!\"The person that greeted Hyun was a weird-looking priestess.Her aura and clothes didn't seem to belong to a priestess.The female priest was wearing a tight and revealing uniform.How she laughed, more than feeling holy, felt naughty.The customs of temples varied a little bit from country and region, but did one that had such an outfit exist in Asrian?But that didn't seem to be the case after seeing the other priests wearing white robes.Ting-[You've reached the Twilight Temple!][If you go and see a priest at an intermediate level or above, he will appraise the job engraved in your soul!][We hope today's meeting will help you find your true self!]As he entered the temple, the quest ended.Just as he had expected, there wasn't any reward, but he wasn't disappointed.Hyun was more immersed in the Twilight Temple's unique atmosphere than he was in the quest.He watched it slowly as if he was a tourist.'What a unique place.'The Twilight Temple had a different atmosphere than the other temples present in Asrian.Even though it was built like a Roman temple, charms and lanterns were everywhere.There was a sculpture of an angel and a dragon intertwined.The sight of the western and Asian cultures mixed was something rare to see.Of course, the weirdest thing was the female priest he had first met.\"Are you in a high position?\"\"Yes?\"As Hyun couldn't suppress his curiosity and asked her, the female priest tilted her head.\"Uhm\u2026 It's because you're wearing a different uniform than the other people.\"\"Oh, you don't need to worry about that. I modified this uniform.\"\"Modified\u2026?\"\"It looks cuter this way, right?\"\"\u2026?\"They hadn't exchanged many words, but it was enough to know that the priestess was weird.She seemed like a charlatan priest.\"You came here after completing your awakening quest, right?\"Hyun was surprised by what she said.She had guessed his intentions for going there as if she were a psychic.As Hyun nodded, she laughed.\"I'm going to take a look at your soul.\"\"Right now\u2026?\"\"Yes, it's not like I have anything else to do.\"Hyun, who was being dragged at the pace of the priestess, nodded.He had no reason to refuse since that was why he was at that place to begin with.They soon reached a place located in one of the corners of the temple.They were alone in that dark room.Hyun just let her do as she wished.Even if she was a charlatan, she was still a priestess, so he thought that he should probably be safe.Whoosh- The priestess\u2019s wand began to shine.A sphere of light pushed through the darkness and wrapped around Hyun's body.[The Twilight Temple's Priestess 'Rutia' wants to see through your soul!][She has promised not to reveal your information to other people!][Warning! Some parts of your status window will be revealed. Do you agree? Y/N]Hyun didn't have any second guesses.Whap-! The light flashed for a moment and slowly started to fade away.With the light, Hyun's information was revealed.\"Oh\u2026! Support\u2026?\"After examining the soul, the priestess exclaimed in amazement.'Hmm? Is there something\u2026?'Hyun's expectations began to grow after seeing the priestess's eyes widen.The main objective of the level 50 tutorial was to get more information about your job.Now that he thought about it, his item was the most expensive-looking sword in the job selecting room.He still didn't understand what that item had to do with a Support, but maybe he would be able to learn the connection right then.At Hyun's expecting words, Rutia just smiled awkwardly.\"Hmm\u2026 It's my first time hearing about it. Hahaha, I'm not sure about it. It's a unique job.\"Hyun frowned.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *It was his mistake trusting in someone that seemed unreliable from the beginning.He thought it would be better to stop getting involved with this suspicious priestess.He tried to sneak away but failed.Suddenly the priestess grabbed Hyun's clothes.\"Where are you going? There are still things we need to talk about!\"\"Isn't it over already?\"\"No, it isn't!\"He tried to free himself from her but failed.Cold sweat dripped from Hyun's forehead.Had he gotten caught by a strange woman?\u2018It would be for the best if I escaped as soon as possible.\u2019He was about to push her away by force when she spoke.\"Empathy! I was trying to explain that to you\u2026\"Hyun stopped resisting once a certain word came out of the priestess's mouth.Empathy, the statl Hyun had obtained after getting the Support job.Up until that moment, he had thought that it was that job's dedicated stat.Was there something else hidden behind Empathy?The priestess smiled mischievously.\"Fufu, do you know what Empathy is?\"\"It's the Support's dedicated stat.\"\"No, it isn't!\"The priestess was thinking about how she should explain to him what she knew.After a while, she clapped.\"Do you want to learn how to pray?\"Ting![ <Quest: The odd priestess Rutia's proposition> ]- One priestess is trying to teach you how to pray.- Maybe it's a waste of time\u2026?He suddenly received a quest notification, but the feeling he got from it could be summarized in the last sentence.\u2014A waste of time.If she hadn't said the word Empathy, he would've rejected the quest without even thinking twice.As Hyun accepted, the priestess began explaining with a smile on her face.\"Have you heard about Transcendents?\"Hyun nodded.The explanation began from a point Hyun already knew about.A Transcendent was someone above humans; they were often called demons or angels.The priests were people that prayed to angels.\"Empathy is related to the Transcendents. Just as a human needs food to live, a Transcendent needs Empathy.\"He learned new things as he kept listening to the priestess's words.Even Hyun didn't remember everything about the game.The explanation he was hearing at that moment was one of those things.\"Angels give humans protection in exchange for their prayer. The reason behind this is that behind the prayer, there's Empathy. Transcendents need Empathy to exercise influence over the world.\"The priestess's way of portraying the Transcendents and humans as if they were in a symbiotic relationship was blasphemous in a certain way; still, it was an appropriate analogy for the situation.\"But the Empathy varies from each person! The prayers of a person with stronger Empathy will reach easier than the other peoples\u2019.\"\"Someone with strong Empathy\u2026\"\"Yes. After all, Empathy isn't something that can be gained with human effort!\"The woman\u2019s explanation kept going for a while.According to her, how much Empathy one had was decided from birth.Priests that dedicated a lot of time to praying could raise their Empathy through a lot of effort, but the difference wasn't that big.But the users, especially him, who was a Support, were the exception to that rule.By raising the stat, he could increase the effectiveness of the prayer.\"Isn't this a great blessing?\"\"Not really\u2026\"The priestess was making a huge deal out of it, but Hyun didn't understand.In the first place, praying didn't match him at all.Even if he was a Support, Hyun enjoyed fighting.Staying behind and praying was not only boring, but his pride as the former number one player didn't allow it.Of course, the priestess didn't know about Hyun's thoughts, so it was understandable that she was feeling frustrated.\"Not really? Think about it again! In the near future, you could even summon an angel or a demon!\"Summon a demon?He wondered if a priestess who served the angels could so easily say something like that.No, more than that, he didn't feel like learning how to pray was worth it.He knew from experience how many things needed to be sacrificed if you wanted to center your playing style around praying.Since she couldn't get Hyun's interest, she changed the topic.For some reason, she was persistent in Hyun learning how to pray.\"It seems like you don't know the real strength of praying!\"\"I know\u2026 But it really doesn't interest me.\"\"Are you sure about that?\"The goddess's eyes flashed sharply.\"Have you heard the story of the priest who fell deep into prayer\u2026?\"She smiled mysteriously while licking her lips and began telling another story.\"There was once a very religious priest. Since he spent all that praying, the others used to call him praying stone sculpture, but one day he fell asleep while praying. Do you know what happened to him once he opened his eyes?\"\"No.\"\"He said that his surroundings had changed.\"Hyun frowned at the priestess\u2019s story.He really couldn't understand what she was trying to say.\"Praying is how a human can get close to a Transcendent. That means, if you become more experienced in praying, you can get closer to them.\"\"\u2026?\"\"Should we try going there too?\"The priestess began casting.A dark red light came out from the tip of her wand.The moment Hyun was touched by it, he suddenly started feeling sleepy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Or another planet.Even he, who had eight years of experience, had never known that a place like that existed.The priestess kept talking while looking at Hyun, who was looking around.\"I just told you the story of the priest that prayed, right? The secret that nobody knows is that he didn't serve angels\u2026 He served demons.\"\"What does that mean...?\"\"While praying to the demons, his Empathy reached them. He crossed the borders of consciousness and entered a world closer to the demons. Everything in this world is symmetrical. If there's a place close to the angels, there's one close to the demons. This place is parallel to reality.\"Hyun couldn't easily trust what the priestess was saying.\"That's right... This place is closer to hell rather than heaven, and that's why the prayers reached the demons!\"Hyun looked around.The temple was completely destroyed, and the forest had disappeared.The sun shone with a black light, and the scenery was tainted red.It was as if a filter called apocalypse had been applied.\"A parallel world...\"Hyun groaned while murmuring.After that, he walked for a while but couldn't find any animal that was alive.From time to time, he saw unidentifiable life forms moving.Was that a demon?Since the place was close to hell, it wouldn't be weird to think that demons existed there.\"We can go back, right?\"\"Of course!\"Flash!As the female priestess finished speaking, lightning struck inside Hyun's brain.His consciousness began to ascend.\u2014He could again hear the birds singing.Instead of an ominous sunset, bright sunlight illuminated the temple.It took him some time to come back to his senses.\"Just now... How?\"\"It's possible if you learn how to pray! Are you interested?\"As soon as she asked that question, Hyun nodded.What had just happened had left a huge impression on him.Hyun still couldn't easily believe what the priestess had said.\u2014But he couldn't say anything since he had seen it with his own eyes.He was surprised that there was a place he hadn't heard about, but on the other hand, he was excited.A parallel world.Why was it that no one knew about that place in Asra Online?There was something Hyun had wondered from the moment he began playing that game.\u2014Was Asrian Online a perfect re-creation of Asra Online?He could understand it if that 'parallel space' was a place newly added on Asrian Online.\u2014Although he didn't get why they had added the place.'I'm glad I came here.'Was that the reason the message had asked him to go to the 'Twilight Temple'?To make him, the Support, learn how to pray?He could understand why they had asked him to go to a determined place if that was the reason.\u2014To teach him the relationship between Empathy and praying.Maybe it wasn't a coincidence that he had met the female priest.He didn't think that she, who could travel through different spaces, was an average priest.\"Me? I'm just a normal priestess.\"She didn't answer properly.\u2018Is she hiding her real identity on purpose?\u2019There was no way to reveal it if she wanted to hide it.Since it seemed that Hyun had made up his mind, the priestess smiled.Praying\u2026It was by far one of the most useless skills.Even most users that had chosen jobs related to a priest didn't learn how to pray.That's why what the female priestess said sounded so different.\"The truth is that even among priests, there aren't many people that know how to pray properly. That's why it will take some time to learn it properly.\"[You're learning the principles of the 'pray' skill!][Progress 3%]\"Praying is a skill that uses Empathy. It's important to empty your consciousness but not fall too deep into the subconsciousness!\"The voice of the priestess sluggishly entered his ears as if it were some kind of religious chanting.To be honest, Hyun couldn't understand most of what she was saying.Hyun felt that the more he concentrated, the faster the skill's progress rate would go up, so he tried to retain as many things as possible.While hearing her explanation, he naturally started to understand how Praying worked.[Praying Lv.0]<Your sincere prayer will reach the Transcendent!

This is all I can teach you.\"The female priestess seemed satisfied by looking at Hyun, who had learned to pray.Hyun smiled.Thanks to her, he had obtained more information about the Support job and Empathy.Leaving aside the first impression, she seemed to be a surprisingly good priestess.Before he left, the priestess told him one more thing.\"If you want to increase your praying proficiency faster, you should use the temple's chapel!\"The priestess kindly lead Hyun to the chapel.Unlike the clean outer appearance, the chapel resembled an old medieval building.Whether it was because the place was old or it wasn't time to pray, there wasn't anyone there.As soon as she left, Hyun tried to use the skill he had just learned.'How did she tell me to do it...?'He slowly tried to remember what she had told him.Since Asrian Online used real brain waves, some skills required the user to understand how it worked.Hyun closed his eyes.He tried to get his consciousness to a near-sleep state.\u2014He had to avoid falling asleep.That way of doing it was what the priestess called the 'proper way of praying.'According to her, most priests weren't able to do it.'Damn, it's hard.'Hyun discovered that the praying skill was surprisingly hard to learn.In Asra Online, everything related to skills could be solved by pressing a button.But in Asrian, which used brain waves, even though they were the same skills, it was harder to learn.Trying to remain in a near-sleep state... He never thought that the way to use prayer would be so ambiguous.\u2014He fell asleep by mistake a few times.He couldn't concentrate because his consciousness floated to the surface whenever he tried to do it.[The skill\u2019s proficiency has reached 100%!][\u2018Pray\u2019 has reached level 1!]'Oh, the proficiency definitely goes up very fast.'He achieved the first level up after 10 minutes.He wasn't sure if the chapel made it easier or if it was because he was doing it properly, but the leveling up speed was really fast.Hyun didn't stop praying.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Now that he had gotten a grasp on how to do it, he planned to increase its level as much as possible.He thought maybe he would have some special merits to praying thanks to his high Empathy stat.'She told me to emphasize with a Transcendant's presence. Right?'He tried to remember the priestess's teachings again.\u2014Emptying the mind and accepting the waves of the air.The traces of the Transcendent could be found in everything around the world.The people who pray try to resonate with that and sympathize with the will of the Transcendent.\u2014That was why Pray was more effective the more Empathy you had.'Hmm?'Hyun, who was praying, frowned.He suddenly began feeling stuffy.He was having a hard time breathing.He wondered if he should stop praying but decided to keep going.[The skill\u2019s proficiency has reached 100%!][\u2019Pray\u2019 has reached level 2!]He suddenly got those messages.Only a few minutes had passed, yet he had leveled up the skill again.Hyun had decided to resist if he felt a sudden discomfort while praying.'Wait, what's happening?'Suddenly, Hyun's shoulders began moving up and down.His body was shaking on its own.Anxiety was added on top of the stuffy feeling.He was so surprised that he stopped praying.'Is this normal?'At first, he thought that there was something wrong with his capsule.But it didn't matter how hard he tried\u2026 He couldn't find an answer.He opened his status window and gulped.It hadn't been that long since he had reached level 2, but the proficiency bar was already at 30%.Hyun tried praying again.He wanted to know what that feeling he had just felt was.When he closed his eyes and tried to calm down, he felt as if his body was slowly being tightened.That suffocating feeling once again became anxiety and fear.\u2014But he didn't stop praying.What was going to happen?[You're sympathizing with a Transcendent that's near!]Although a system message had appeared, Hyun couldn't see it since he had his eyes closed.Suddenly, Hyun was walking somewhere while praying.Just like a sleepwalker, he was walking through the temple with his eyes closed.He didn't know the destination.He just walked to where his feet were taking him.A strange feeling stirred his heart as he got closer to a certain place.Creak-Hyun opened his eyes after he opened a door and entered a room.\u2014He opened his eyes at the same time he stopped praying.At that moment, his weird emotions disappeared, and his body stopped shaking.'This place...'It was a room he had never been to.It was full of dust.It looked older and shabbier than the chapel.It was like a neat, spacious warehouse.\"Hmm?\"Hyun turned his head around and looked at one side of the room.In the corner of the room, he saw a chair.A small kid was sitting on top of it.'Who is she?'Hyun looked at her again.She seemed to be around 10 years old\u2014she looked like a third-grader.Even though her clothes were torn apart in some parts, they were quite luxurious.But that place was an empty warehouse; it wasn't a place where a kid should be.Was she maybe an apprentice priestess who had escaped from lessons?He thought so at first, but soon he discovered that he had made the wrong assumption.Two chains tied to the chair were restraining both of the girl\u2019s legs.It was as if she was a prisoner.\"Ah...!\"Their eyes met, and the girls made a short exclamation.Hyun flinched a little bit. The reason was that the girl's gaze was out of focus.A lot of different thoughts crossed through Hyun's mind.\u2018Who is she? Why did they leave this kid here tied up to a chair?\u2019\u2018And how did I get to this place?\u2019Hyun kept looking at the girl for a while, but she didn't say anything else.She just looked at Hyun with a blurred gaze.Creak-!Suddenly, the sound of the door opening echoed through the space.'Damn!'Hyun reacted fast.He subconsciously threw his body to the side of the room and hid behind a column.He peeked while trying to hold his breath.Tap, tap,\u00a0the sounds of the footsteps were getting closer to where the girl was tied up.Soon, he saw who they were.The two men were priests.They were wearing normal priest uniforms\u2026But their actions weren't normal at all.They stood in front of the girl and began talking to each other.And then\u2026They put a wand in front of the head of the little girl, and\u00a0Whap! a dark green cloud covered the girl's body.Ah...! Hyun almost spoke out loud. He knew what magic the man was using.It was a mental status interfering skill.Then a lot of different magics began activating.Hyun knew most of them just by seeing their effects.Then he noticed something.'There's a magic circle!'Various patterns were surrounding the kid.He hadn't noticed it before because the magic circle only began emitting light once the priest activated his magic.Whir- Whir-\u00a0The magic circle resonated while making an unpleasant noise.\u2018Were they applying all these to that little kid?\u2019She clearly wasn't there out of her own volition.You could see that by her groaning in pain from the priest's magic.Hyun's heart began beating faster than ever.A virtual reality that's very close to real life\u2026Even if it was a game, seeing a little girl cry in pain gave him a bad sensation,Hyun's breathing became slower.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 - Twilight Temple (3)Both priests looked at each other and nodded after applying a lot of different spells on the little girl, and then they left the room.Hyun slowly approached the girl once he couldn't hear the men anymore.Then their eyes met again.'What's happening?'The girl's eyes were still out of focus.Her face was even paler than before.Hyun immediately took out an item from his inventory.\u2014It was an elixir that allowed you to recover from any abnormal status condition.It was an item Hyun had obtained after defeating a hidden named monster, but he didn't hesitate for even a second before using it on the girl.Hyun carefully dripped the elixir into the girl's mouth.\"Ugh\u2026 This place.\"The elixir quickly took effect.The girl soon began to mumble.Once Hyun freed her from the chains binding her, she fully recovered her consciousness.Thankfully, the chains weren\u2019t magical items, so Hyun could break them with the things he was carrying.The girl seemed moved by the sight of Hyun freeing her from the chains.\"Ooh, you're trying to free me? You have my gratitude! But tell me, who are you? And why are you trying to save me?\" she said.\"Be quiet\u2026\"Hyun was afraid of her voice leaking out through the door.The girl, who had then been freed, looked at Hyun with teary eyes.\"Ugh\u2026 I'm hungry. Won't you sell me something to eat?\"\"Something to eat\u2026?\"\"Yes, anything is good. I'm okay with anything!\"When he looked inside his inventory, he found an old piece of bread.It was the food you got for free when you created a character, but Hyun had never even tried it.If he was hungry, he could just log out and grab some food.A user did not need to solve basic needs inside the game.As Hyun took out a piece of bread from his inventory, the girl exclaimed in excitement.\"Oh, ohh\u2026!\"The little hands that were about to grab the bread suddenly stopped.The girl's face, while she was rummaging through her pockets, was wet with tears.After checking out her pockets for a while, she spoke.\"I\u2026 Don't seem to have any money with me.\"Just like she said, she didn't have anything.To be more precise, she didn't have anything that could be turned into money.The necklace the girl was wearing around her neck\u2026The blue jewel placed in the middle shone even in the dark.\u2014It could probably be sold for hundreds of gold in the market.He was wondering how they hadn't taken that necklace from her.The girl got surprised because Hyun had placed his eyes on her necklace; she quickly wrapped her hands around it.\"I\u2026 I cannot give you this\u2026! I cannot lose this\u2026!\"\"I won't take it.\"The necklace did indeed look expensive, but he wasn't interested in that.What he wanted to know was her identity and why she was in that situation.\"You can pay me back later on, so just eat.\"\"Are you sure\u2026?! How much do I owe you?!\"\"10 gold\u2026\"The girl's face brightened at Hyun's words.In the Asrian world, 10 gold wasn't a small amount of money.Not only that, but she hadn't asked him to give her some food, she had asked him to sell it to her\u2026The girl had an unusual set of values.\"It's delicious\u2026! So delicious\u2026!\"She ate the food in the blink of an eye.\u2018If she eats it like that, won't her throat become stuffy?\u2019Hyun took out a bottle of water from his inventory.Just like with the food, Asrian's user didn't feel thirst, so he had no real use for the water bottles.The girl drank the water.After taking a few sips, she became worried.\"How much is the water\u2026?\"\"That's a service if you pay for the bread.\"\"Service\u2026?\"\"I mean, it's free.\"Ohh- After nodding her head, her facial expression brightened.The girl ate and drank what was left of the bread and water.Hyun was just watching her.\"What's your name?\"The girl shrugged her shoulders in surprise, but after a while, she answered.\"Louise\u2026 You can call me Louise.\"\"Louise?\"Hyun went through the Asra Online information he had in his head.Because he had played the story content, he knew most of the important information about the relevant NPCs.But it was his first time hearing the name Louise.If he didn't have it on the NPC list, that meant that she wasn't important in the game's story.'It seems like the name of a noble\u2026'\u2018Why did the temple lock down the daughter of a noble family?\u2019He couldn't even imagine what was behind the event.'What should I do\u2026'Suddenly, he had one more concern: he was clearly an outsider to the temple.If he left, he would move on, and it would be as if their meeting had never taken place.But Hyun was having a hard time abandoning her like that.The scared expression the little girl had on her face was real.Should he get involved? Or just ignore the whole situation?Ting- While Hyun wondered about that, he got a quest notification.[ <Main Quest: Save Louise!> ]- The girl that has been trapped in the temple by unknown people is waiting for someone to help her. She may need your help.<Reward: None>After reading the details of the quest, Hyun scrunched his eyebrows.The rules were different.In Asrian, most quests were activated when an NPC asked you for a favor.But right then, even though Louise hadn't said anything, a quest had activated.'Main Quest?'It was a phrase he had never seen in Asra Online.Hyun's eyes widened after reading the words \u2018Main Quest\u2019.'This means she isn't just a simple NPC\u2026 Right?'Hyun looked at Louise up and down again.Her outer appearance was that of a normal 10 years old kid.She had a peculiar way of speaking, and the situation she was in was even stranger.The girl who had finished the bread looked at Hyun with uneasiness while drinking water.He could sense what she was feeling.Her eyes were filled with fear.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\"Do you want to get out of here?\" Hyun said without noticing.\"C\u2026 Can you help me\u2026?\" Louise asked Hyun while trembling.\"Sob, Sob\u2026\"Tears flowed from the girl's eyes. Although she hadn't told him the reason, he thought he could understand a little bit of what was going on.Hyun let her cry for a moment\u2014he thought that would be for the best.\"I'll help you get out. After all, I have a lot of free time.\"[You've accepted the quest!]After Louise stopped crying, Hyun opened the window.It was night outside.Hyun grabbed Louise with his arms and jumped.'If it's now\u2026'Maybe it was because of the time, but he couldn't see the priests he had seen during the day.The temple at night was engulfed in silence.They probably wouldn't be found out if they hid in the darkness.Hyun began walking quickly with Louise.'Who?!'Hyun turned his head around.He felt the presence of someone from the side.'Huh\u2026?'Was he mistaken? There wasn't anyone there.Had his senses become sharper?Anyway, he thought it would be better if they escaped from the temple as quickly as possible.\"Can you run quickly?\" Hyun asked Louise.\"A\u2026 Are you asking me?\"\"Is there anyone here besides you?\"Louise answered Hyun's question while mumbling.\"I can move somewhat fast\u2026 I'm able to use wind magic\u2026\"\"That's great. Let's go.\"What Louise could use was wind-type magic of the moving type.Swoosh- She cast wind and began running.Surprisingly, there wasn't that much difference compared to Hyun's speed.They soon got out of the temple, and a straight road appeared.\u2014It was the road he had seen while going to the Twilight Temple.Hyun began running down it with Louise.'Wait a moment. There's something strange\u2026'Hyun felt as if a ghost had tricked them.'Wasn't the distance only 10 minutes when walking?'It didn't matter how much they ran. There didn't seem to be an end to the road.He felt as if they'd been running in a loop.He turned around.The distance between them and the temple hadn't decreased.\"What's happening\u2026 There doesn't seem to be an end.\" Louise asked Hyun with uneasiness\u2014it seemed that she also felt that something was wrong.Hyun and Louise were trapped in the forest maze.'Is there a barrier here?'That was the only explanation he could come up with.But he couldn't go back to the temple.The moment they were struggling with what they should do\u2026A white light rose from the direction of the temple.A white light was shot into the night sky as if it was a firework.Then the lights changed direction toward where Hyun and Louise were standing and hit something that was in front of them.Clang!Hyun and Louise were thrown to the floor from the explosion's shock.\"S\u2026 Something came flying from behind\u2026!\"Even if she hadn't told him, he knew what had happened.The scenery in front of them changed.'What's happening?'The endless road had disappeared, and a thick forest was in its place.A lot of weird things were happening one after the other.'Did someone help us?'After the light hit them, it was clear that something like a barrier had broke.It was clearly magic that was shot from the temple.'Damn it. I don't know what's going on!'He wasn't sure about anything.The only thing he knew was that the child was involved in something big.\u2026Or maybe she was the center of the incident.The tumult in the temple was getting stronger.There was no time to doubt.Hyun grabbed Louis's arms and began running toward the forest.He thought that option would be better even if they found a monster that lived in the forest.\"Do you have any destinations in mind?\" Hyun asked Louise while running.Louise shook her head.If she didn't have anywhere to go, it would be better if they went as far away as possible from the temple.'We have no choice but to cross the forest\u2026 The closest town to this forest is Lecatra Castle, so we should go there first!'Both started to run across the forest.The good thing was that Louise ran almost as fast as Hyun.To be more precise, she wasn't running\u2014she was using magic that used the wind to move her.Thanks to that, Louise didn't get out of breath easily.'How far can we run away\u2026?'Even while running, Hyun constantly turned his head around.The forest that Gluna illuminated was as bright as a city's nightscape.If someone came chasing them, they wouldn't be able to escape easily.Hyun's worries very soon became reality.\"Hide\u2026!\"Hyun, who had suddenly stopped running, pressed Louise's shoulders.\"W\u2026 What are you doing\u2026?!\"\"Shh, be quiet\u2026\"They kneeled and hid behind a rock while trying to hold their breaths.Hyun and Louise could see a shadow approaching them from a distance.'Did they catch up to us already\u2026?'A shadow figure wearing black clothes was slowly walking across the forest.He took a closer look.The shadow was wearing tight clothes and was using a mask to cover the mouth.\u2014It was a typical Thief outfit.Because of the tight clothes, he knew that the one following them was a woman.'She's not a priestess\u2026'Hyun tried to think.Was she an assassin?Why was there someone like her at a temple?What level was she?Could he beat her in a fight?While he was thinking, the girl chasing them down was getting closer.If they remained still, it would be a matter of time before she discovered them.Whish-!Suddenly, a sharp dagger came flying toward them.A blind spot! An unexpected surprise attack!The blue dagger came flying toward Louise's neck.\u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb!Hyun immediately used his skill.Clash!The dagger that came flying as fast as light bounced off Louise's neck.Louise flopped down while touching her neck.\"Ah, ugh\u2026\"It seems like she thought for a moment that she had died.Her thin hands that were touching the ground were shaking.\"Tsk\u2026!\"Hyun turned around.The one who had launched a surprise attack on them was someone who appeared from behind.It was a man who was standing still with his hands extended.\"\u2026\"Since his attack had failed, he stood still because of the unexpected result, but his expression hadn't changed.It seemed like the woman also heard the noise and was quickly approaching them.Hyun's heart began beating faster.'Damn it. This isn't a joke\u2026'He had been lucky to block the last attack with his \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb.Hyun remembered something from the past.The hidden named boss, Leopard.His main attack, 'Ice Top,' was so fast that if he or Ain weren't concentrating, they wouldn't have been able to brush it off.But those peoples\u2019 attacks were faster than Leopards.'It's too dangerous.'The opponents were getting closer to them.Even though they were walking while stepping on the fallen leaves, they weren't making any noise. It was as if they were cats.Hyun's eyes sank coldly as he watched them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 - The Mysterious Girl (1)'Level 200... Maybe her level is even higher than that.'Among the possible second job changes, there was one passive from an assassin-type job that could make your steps silent.Is that a skill, or is she just trained very well...?There was only one thing he was sure about: their level was higher than his.'I can't read their expressions.'Neither of them showed any kind of emotions in their eyes.They were the eyes of assassins who didn't have any humanity.It was hard looking at them in the eyes.At moments like that, he hated how real virtual reality felt.It didn't feel good to shrug because you felt overwhelmed by the enemy.\u00abVision Sword\u00bb.Whir- A giant blue light appeared on his hands.The sword that illuminated the darkness resembled a sacred sword.As he took out the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb, the opponents stepped back cautiously.Hyun noticed that slight change in them.'Yes, you should be at least a little bit scared.'Even though \u00abVision Sword\u00bb lasted for 1.5 seconds, it was enough to scare the opponents.\u2014Even a corner rat can scare off a cat.It was better to bluff rather than be looked down on to earn some time.On the other hand, he kept thinking\u2026'If we fight, we're going to lose.'The moment he had seen the opponents, he had known they were in another league.Escaping was the best option.But the problem was the difference in the speed.The opponents were probably at least level 200 and with job related to the Thief class, so there was no way that they were slower than him and Louise.Could they escape?He had doubts. Hyun bit clenched his teeth.He had to at least try it.\"Run!\"Hyun grabbed Louise's hands and pulled her.Louise also used all the strength she had to run.He looked back\u2014the two masked assassins were chasing them.You could feel a sense of calmness in their steps.It was probably the confidence of knowing that they could catch their prey whenever they wanted.\u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb!Hyun, who was paying attention to his back, reacted immediately.Clang-!A blue knife hit Louise on her back and bounced away.Louise shrugged her shoulders.\"Don't worry about that!\" Hyun shouted.Louise didn't answer. She didn't even nod.They just ran forward with all their might.Hyun had no other choice but to react to all the long-range attacks.The moment he lost sight of their movements, it would be their end.Clang-!Once again, the dagger hit Louise's neck.As soon as the dagger hit Louise's neck, she, who had been struggling with her breath, coughed.He grabbed Louise, who was about to fall.\"Don't stop!\"Hyun pushed his concentration close to its limits.From the moment they threw the dagger to when it reached them, there was a time frame of 0.1~0.2 seconds.\u2014It was faster than any other attack he had seen in Asrian Online.It seemed impossible to see it and react with human capabilities.'My reaction is too slow...!'The process of defending against a long-range attack was separated into three parts: see it, judge it, and react to it.But that only made things slower, so Hyun removed one part.It was the second part, 'judge.'He just saw the attack and reacted.He needed to minimize his time thinking if he wanted to react faster.He didn't think who the attack was targetting.He immediately applied \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb on Louise.But there was a limit to such kinds of strategies\u2026\u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb!Hyun realized it a moment laterThat time, the target wasn't Louise\u2026 It was him.By the time he noticed it, the dagger had already penetrated him.[You've received 672 damage!][You've received more than 33% of your HP as damage at once!][Until you stop 'bleeding,' your HP will slowly go down by 1% per tick!]\"Ugh...!\"The sensation of being stabbed in the back made him groan.The pain disappeared quickly, but the dangerous situation hadn't ended yet.If they couldn't leave them behind, they would continue being hunted.The only good thing was that the woman wasn't attacking them.Was that because only one of them had throwing skills?Then maybe using the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb to bluff had been a great decision.Clang-!Once again, the dagger hit Louise and bounced away.That time, Hyun also felt relieved.He had been about to apply \u00abOne Second Absorption' on himself but had changed the target of it at the last moment.'Damn it! What's this? An O, X quiz show...?!'Hyun clenched his teeth.Every time the masked man put his hands on his sleeves, he felt like he had stopped breathing.He understood what the people that played Russian roulette felt.He only had two options.\u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb!Thud-!This time, he was wrong.The dagger went through Hyun's shoulders.[You've received 629 damage!][You've received more than 33% of your HP as damage at once!][Your left arm has been stunned, so you won't be able to move it for a while!][Because your HP has dropped to less than 20%, the effect of 'The Blood Fairy's Frenzy' has activated!]He had no other choice.If he tried to react after analyzing the attack, he wouldn't be able to protect either of them, so he had to pick one of the two.'This is the worst...!'Even though the Blood Fairy's buff was on, the situation hadn't changed much.Even if Hyun's speed increased, Louise's running speed stayed the same.The problem was the 'reaction speed.' It wasn't something that increasing 'moving speed' could solve.He couldn't think of a proper solution.Should he gather all the monsters in the surroundings and confuse them?After considering that for a while, he shook his head.If they were really over level 200, there was a chance that the monsters would be scared of them and not get close at all.\u2014How they hadn't seen a single monster while running was proof of that.In the end, he could think of only one solution.He couldn't think of anything else.\"Louise, entrust your soul to me!\"Hyun turned his head around and looked at Louise.While Hyun shouted that, a system interface appeared in front of Louise, It was her first time seeing something like that.For inhabitants of Asrian, the system box was probably some kind of unknown magic.[Player 'Hyun' wants to control your body.][Will you entrust your soul to him? Y/N]\"Th... This...? What's this...?\"Louise's face seemed flustered by the sudden message she received.\"Quickly!\"\"O-okay...! I'll entrust my soul to you!\"Even though Louise had accepted the proposition because of their situation, she still felt uneasy.Entrusting her soul?That sounded like evil words that a dark priest would say.What would happen to her body from then on?Would she be able to regain control of it?She probably wouldn't have accepted it if her life weren't in danger.Accepting that was like trying to grasp onto whatever hope she had left.[The other party has accepted your request!][Now you can use \u00abAssimilation\u00bb on 'Louise.']\u00abAssimilation\u00bb!Hyun became light, scattered, and then entered Louise's body.Louise felt something different once her body shone.It was as if someone else existed inside her.As soon as Hyun finished Assimilating, he used \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb on Louise's body.At the same time\u2026Clang-!\u00a0The dagger hit the chest and bounced away while making a metallic sound.'Yes...!'With that, he no longer needed to decide between them.Thanks to Assimilation, both of their bodies had become one.Hyun, who sighed in relief, opened the status window.[ Louise (Lv. 35) ]<Currently Assimilating with the following soul: Hyun (Lv. 68)>HP: 312/525Mana: 1904/1960Job: (???)[Strength: 1] [Agility: 12(+2)] [Vitality: 10(+5)] [Mana: 110(+86)]<Skill List>[Steps of the Wind Lv.3(+1)]- Blow a strong wind toward the floor, which makes you move faster.(You can't use it in the air)- If you attack with the wind, deal [Magical Power]X0.4 damage.- It costs 10 mana per minute.[Low Fever Lv.0(+1)]- Light a small flame in the palm of your hands to shine on the darkness.- If you attack with the fire, deal [Magical Power]X0.05 damage.- It costs 5 mana per minute.<Thanks to the soul of 'Hyun,' the following skills are also available for use!>[\u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb Lv.8] - <+Expand>[\u00abShield\u00bb Lv.0] - <+Expand>Hyun smiled bitterly after checking out Louise's stats.She didn't have any offensive skills.The only good thing was that her principal moving skill, \u00abStep of the Wind\u00bb, didn't consume a lot of mana.[The Blood Fairy's Frenzy effect is currently active!][All speed has increased by 50%!]The effect of the items buff was active even after Assimilating.\u2018So after Assimilating, the previous buffs don't disappear? Or do both buffs get added on top of each other?\u2019He planned on investigating it later on.Vrrrrrr-Suddenly, an attack came from the side.The girl who had been silently looking from the sides had decided to make her move.The rapier was about to cut Louise's waist when\u2026Pang-! Louise's light body bounced up as if it were a rocket.It was all thanks to Hyun using the \u00abSteps of the wind\u00bb!'That was dangerous...!'Because Louise's skills used the wind to move, it was a little bit hard to control it.It was as if her body bounced from here to there without being able to control it.But at that moment, he couldn't make a single mistake.\u00abVision Sword\u00bb!A giant sword appeared in Louise\u2019s hands.The sight of a little girl holding a two-meter sword looked funny from the outside.But there wasn't weight to the light, so even a kid with little arms could use it.The masked woman was about to pierce them.Louise looked at her and attacked.\u2014A blue light beam that pierces what's in front!The rapier and \u00abVision Sword\u00bb clashed against each other.Because of the impact, Louise's body bounced away.Without killing the effect of the impact\u2026'Steps of the Wind!'Louise kicked on the ground and accelerated again.Louise, who leaped forward incredibly fast, landed on a giant tree that was on the other side.There was still some time left for the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb.Clink!Before leaping forward, Louise chopped down the tree.\"...!\"Both masked assassins were planning to use that tree to land before leaping forward again.But thanks to Hyun cutting the entire tree, they had no place to safely land.Paf- The masked woman stepped on the falling tree and moved on to another one, but the masked man made a mistake mid-air.Crumble-He fell to the ground with the tree branch.After rolling on the ground a couple of times, he looked up to the sky.There he saw a little girl and his partner chasing after her, both getting far away from him at an incredible speed.'Did we leave one behind?'Hyun jumped from tree after tree.In that forest, there were many giant trees.He stepped on the tree branches and tried to get as high as possible.The higher they went, the thinner the tree branches became. Hyun thought that the one chasing after them would struggle compared to Louise, who was very light.He turned Louise's head around and saw her getting annoyingly close.Her steps were so light that it was as if she was using leaves to step on.'There's one minute left to the Blood Fairy's buff...'The distance between Louise and the one chasing them didn't increase nor decrease.\u2026But once the buff was over, the distance between them would shrink.'I have to lose her before that!'The movements of the masked woman weren't normal.Her posture was perfect even while running stepping on trees that were tens of meters over the ground.Hyun changed the direction of the track in the air.He stepped on the trees as if they were stairs and reached the top of the forest.More than running, it was as if they were flying.They were nearly 100 meters over the ground.From the sky, he could get a clear view of the scenery.\u2014Lat Forrest.From the times of Asra Online, this place was famous for its vastness.Looking from the top, he found the place he had been looking for.'It's over there...!'The woman was still chasing after them.\u2018A little bit more!\u2019Hyun, no Louise, sprinted through the sky.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 - The Mysterious Girl (2)As time went on, the destination began to come into sight little by little.A 50-meter-wide cliff.A huge gap across the middle of the forest revealed its majesty.The scenery made it look like the earth had its jaws wide open. It was so vast and deep that he was sure there wasn't a place like this in real life.It was one of the most famous places in the Lat Forest, a giant canyon called 'Giant's Lung.'In front of it, Hyun used Luise's skill to step on a tree branch and jump across the cliff.Louise's body soared high into the sky.Jump!The only thing that supported her body was the air.The air enveloped her body.Louise let the inertia move her body.Paf-!It seemed like the masked woman was confident that she'd be able to do the jump, so she also jumped in front of the cliff.It probably looked like two dots doing a parabolic flight from a distance.Then, suddenly, the two dots became three.Hyun had stopped Assimilating with Louise.\"What...?!\"For the first time, the woman spoke in surprise.While flying, an unknown person suddenly appeared in front of her and was blocking her path.Her mouth became wide-opened in surprise.She calmed down and placed her hands on her waist.She would eliminate this guy with her sword and then continue her chase.\u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb, \u00abShield\u00bb!Just before they clashed, Hyun used two techniques.Tik-\u00a0The moment the blade was about to cut Hyun\u2026The woman suddenly felt her consciousness fading away.When she regained consciousness, she was falling into the canyon.\u2014But the only one falling was her.Where was that guy?What happened to the guy that was blocking her way?!\"Oof...\"Louise, who had sat down on the floor, sighed in relief.\u201cHa, ha,\u201d he began to laugh while taking short breaths.Even though that laugh was coming out of Louise's mouth, it was Hyun who was laughing.Hyun had used \u00abAssimilation\u00bb again to enter Louise's body.Soon, the masked man appeared on the other side of the cliff.He looked at the canyon without saying anything and then directed his gaze toward Louise.After a short while, he took out a flare and shot a flame into the sky.Magical Power began spreading to the surrounding areas.That flame was probably a signal to call for more allies.\u2018Does this mean that there were more than two people following us?\u2019Hyun\u2019s expression darkened.\"...\"The masked man who was looking at Louise turned around.It seemed like he had concluded that he wouldn't be able to jump the cliff successfully.Louise, who finally had a little bit of time to relax, lay down on the ground.\"Ugh...\"As she took a breath, Hyun also felt the tiredness and pain she was feeling.\u00abAssimilation\u00bb was a skill that made you resonate with the other person's soul and even share what the other one was feeling.He could undo \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, but he decided to remain in that state for a while.He just wanted to close his eyes and sleep for the whole day.\"You mustn't touch the sun...\" Louise suddenly mumbled.She knew Hyun was currently inside her body.She also knew that even if she spoke alone, he'd be able to listen to it.\"There's special tracking magic applied in me... Sunlight is the medium that makes it possible to locate me.\"\"The sun?\"\"That's right... So before morning comes, we have to find a place that isn't touched by the sun.\"After hearing Louise's words, Hyun was even more curious about her identity.Hyun was sure she wasn't an important character in the story.After all, Hyun remembered most details about important NPCs thanks to Asra.It was his first time hearing the name Louise.There's no way he wouldn't remember an important character.'If what she's saying is true... There's only one magic in Asra that uses the sun to track an opponent.'It was a spell called \u00abStigma of Light\u00bb.Rather than magic, it was closer to being a curse.He wondered why that child, who wasn't even a main character, was under such a horrible curse.It was such special magic that not even a level 500 Priest or Magician could use.Only a few NPCs that were either angels or heavenly beings could use it.Even as a user, the only way to get rid of \u00abStigma of Light\u00bb was to die.Of course, unless they were the regenerative monsters, NPCs would disappear once they died.\"Stigma of Light.\"\"What's that...?\"\"That's the name of the curse they've applied on you. If what you said is true, we can't stay here.\"Hyun, who had disassimilated, grabbed Louise's hand and helped her stand up.Louise was bittersweet that she had to get out from the sweet break, but Hyun pulled her up.Both began to move while trying to avoid the sunlight.\"Where should we go...?\" Louise said while looking around nervously.\"Somewhere the sun can't reach.\"\"So\u2026 where would that be?\"\"A Dungeon.\"\"What dungeon\u2026? Oh, no, I'm just going to follow you.\"Louise asked again, but she shook her head after looking at Hyun's expression.\"Since I've entrusted my soul to you, I'll follow you until the end.\"\"There's no need to go to such lengths...\"Hyun and Louise walked together.Because she collapsed, they rested a little bit.They reached the destination after moving for about two hours.\u2014The entrance of the dungeon.The entrance was so big that it seemed that even a giant would be able to go through it.The stairs that led to the underground were very dark.Hyun didn't doubt for a moment and walked into it, but Louise seemed scared.Her trembling hands grabbed Hyun's robes.\"You don't need to worry. I'm very familiar with this place.\"\"There's no way that's true...!\"\"I'm not lying.\"As Hyun began walking, Louis hurriedly stuck close to him.It felt as if there wasn't an end to the staircase.The deeper they went, the darker it got.Gluna's light didn't reach the insides of the dungeon; there also wasn't any illumination inside of it.Louise, who couldn't help but feel anxious, used her magic to illuminate the way.Fwosh- A small light ignited on Louise's hands. The inside of the dungeon was filled with a warm light.Hyun, who was looking at her from the side, laughed in a low tone of voice.\"It's similar to Ain's magic... Although the size is smaller.\"\"Ain...?\"\"She's someone I know.\"After going down for a while, they finally reached the end of the staircase, and a crossroad that looked like a maze began.Hyun never stopped walking even though there were numerous crossroads.He was so comfortable because he had used to use that dungeon in Asra as a leveling-up course.'I miss it a little bit.'Hyun laughed again.He couldn't believe that he was reminiscing about the past in such a place and situation.But he really felt like that, so he could do nothing about it.\"Here should be okay.\"Hyun and Louise stopped after passing through numerous crossroads.After walking through a narrow maze, they'd reached a fairly large empty space.It was a quiet and comfortable resting place, except for the bats on the ceiling.\"You're tired, right? Try to sleep a little bit.\"\"Here...?\"\"Yes. This place has a lot of traps and monsters, so even they shouldn't be able to enter so easily.\"\"W-wait...! Isn't it weird to sleep in such a place?\"\"Don't worry. You're safe here.\"Hyun opened the inventory and gave Louise some bread and water.\"You can eat before you sleep. It's 10 gold for a piece of bread, don't forget to pay me later on. Okay?\"\"What about you? Aren't you going to eat?\"Louise was extending her hand when she suddenly stopped and looked at Hyun.From what she knew, Hyun also hadn't eaten anything.Hyun let out a smirk.\"I'm a user, so I won't get hungry even if I don't eat. Oh, you know what a user is, right?\"\"But...\"\"Don't worry, just eat.\"After doubting for a while, Louise finally began eating and drinking water.Was it because of how tired she was? After finishing, she almost immediately fell asleep.Once she fell asleep, the only noise that could be heard in the dungeon was the sound of breathing.Hyun looked at the sleeping Louise for a while.How she was leaning against a rock seemed uncomfortable.He picked her up and then made her lay down in a straight line.She didn't wake up, even though he had lifted her.Hyun opened the status window and checked out the quest details again.The details had changed a little bit.[ - Take Louise to the nearest town or city. She doesn't have anything to give you as a reward. ]Hyun smiled bitterly.He wondered why he was doing a quest like that when an important patch was coming.He laughed at himself, but he didn't feel it was unfair.SeoHyun changed his settings to rest mode and came out from the capsule.He connected the capsule with his computer to check out how Louise was doing, so that he'd know when she woke up.He tried to browse some Asrian communities during his free time, but he got bored after a few hours.SeoHyun couldn't sleep.If he did, maybe Louise could get into a dangerous situation.Louise woke up after a while.The sunlight was coming through the window.It was Monday morning.\"Hmm... There's a group class in the morning.\"He saw Louise through the PC screen.She seemed anxious after waking up and finding out that he wasn't there.It was clear that she was looking for him.\"Should I not go to class today?\"Hyun was a game addict, but he had never negatively affected another person because of it.But he thought that his quest might take a lot of time, so he thought that maybe it would be an exception.If it was a normal quest, he would've just given up, but he really didn't want to do that for this one.It was the first time he had received a named 'main quest,' but there was also another reason\u2026Louise was starting to get more and more anxious.She was probably crying.If he wasn't there, would she be able to escape?That was impossible.The safe place of the dungeon changed constantly depending on the hour and day.After a few hours, that place would be filled with monsters.There was no way a little kid would be able to survive.\"Oof, I have no other choice.\"As soon as Hyun logged in, Louise rushed to him and grabbed his collar.\"Where were you...?! I-I thought you'd abandoned me...!\"\"I was thinking of leaving you but decided not to.\"\"W... What...?! You've even taken my soul, yet...!\"\"I was kidding. It was a joke.\"Since she was starting to get angry, Hyun tried to calm her.It was hard trying to adjust to the mood of a kid.After crying for a while, she began mumbling.\"This place is too dark... I want to get out.\"\"Not yet.\"\"Why?! We already lost them. And if we get out at night, we'll be able to avoid the sunlight, right?\"\"We haven't lost them yet.\"Louise's breath stopped at Hyun's words.Nearly half a day had passed since they'd entered the dungeon, and during that time, no one had appeared.That's why Louise thought she'd be safe from then on. That was also why she was so shocked at Hyun's words.\"The opponents have a Thief-type job, right? Even without the sun, they should be able to hunt prey easily. They can follow our smell or even footsteps...\"\"Footsteps...?!\"\"Yes, that's why they probably know we've entered a dungeon. They're probably preparing a team to enter it, or maybe they're waiting for us to come out.\"\"That...!\"Louise's face became pale, but Hyun kept explaining to her.\"Don't worry. There isn't anyone that knows this place better than me.\"\"Y-you...?\"\"Yes, so trust me.\"Louise grabbed Hyun's collar with a tearful look on her face.Hyun smiled at Louise, who was following him.He felt as if he'd changed jobs to a nanny.\"Now that I think about it, I don't know your name... If it isn't too much, could you tell me how you're called...?\"\"Hyun.\"It was a nickname he'd used since Asra, and he was more used to it than his real name by then.\"My name is Hyun.\"____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 - The Mysterious Girl (3)Kwon DaeHo.There was no one in Korea\u2026 no, no one in the entire world who didn't know him.He was a legend in the modern scientific community that had won three Nobel Prizes by the time he was 57 years old, regardless of the field of learning.A genius of the century!Some people said that there had never been someone that surpassed him in the past, nor there would be in the future.But only a few people knew that he was the main person behind the development of Asrian Online.\"Tsk... A problem has happened.\"Kwon DaeHo was sitting in his chair while drinking coffee when he read a system alert.A screen filled with holograms.On top of that, there were a lot of numbers that disturbed the view.Kwon DaeHo was concentrated on one of those numbers.[Causality]: - 82%It was a % that showed the stability of the world.The bigger the negative number was, the more unstable the world was and vice-versa.In other words, the situation in which the 'causality' had dropped to a minus 82% meant that the world of Asrian was fluctuating rapidly.The world was converted to numbers through tens of thousands of different variables.The number of inhabitants, predominant religion, politics, history, language...All those figures were repeating a continuos sharp rise and fall.There was only one possible explanation for the situation\u2026'The main story's flow is changing because of an external factor!'But how was it that something like that had happened when they were about to apply the new patch?Even he didn't understand what had caused the situation.'We can't apply the patch before the current situation gets solved.'The main story that started after the patch would happen five years after current events.Asrian was basically a giant simulation. What they were going to do was accelerate the time, so five years would pass in an instant.But if the causality % dropped a lot, the number of calculations that the computer had to do would increase, and the system would be overloaded.\"Chairman!\"At that moment, one of the investigators Kwon DaeHo had called entered through the door.She was one of the people that spent the day staring at the monitor because there wasn't anything to do.\"I've found the reason! Doctor... No, chairman!\"Mari shouted happily.\"Oh, really?\"\"Yes! This is all because of a single user! I'm 100% sure of it!\"Mary turned around several switches, and then the screen changed to the gameplay of a certain user.They could see a small girl, Louise, running while stepping on the trees on the screen.It was the image of Hyun, who was using \u00abAssimilation\u00bb on Louise.The sight of Louise stepping into the sky and the background changing quickly was mesmerizing.Kwon DaeHo's mouth was open wide.\"What's that...?\"He was the person in charge of development, but he didn't have much free time, unlike the rest, so he didn't have time to monitor the players.It was also his first time seeing someone\u2019s gameplay.\"Th-this type of movement\u2026 is it even possible...? How can a girl who seems to be 10 years old move like that?\"\"Chairman, that girl is an NPC. The player is the one who's Assimilating into her!\"Robert explained to him.Because Kwon TaeHo wasn't completely ignorant about the game, he understood what Robert meant.After seeing how Hyun controlled his character, he laughed out in amazement.\"I can understand why you guys are so hooked on looking at gameplays. Looking at people like this would be very fun.\"\"Haha...\"\"Give me more detailed information.\"\"Yes, sir.\"In the corner of the screen, the information about everything that had happened until then and things that would happen in the future was displayed.Louise\u2026It also said what her identity was... and also how she would influence the future events that were about to happen in Asrian, so Kwon DaeHo understood the situation.\"I see... Because of that quest, things that should've happened in five years are already happening.\"\"That's the only possible explanation.\"\"That's amazing. To think that there's already a user who can influence so much on the flow of the story\u2026 Once the quest ends, there will be a huge gap between them and the rest.\"They had a problem\u2026They couldn't do the patch if things were going on like that.There was a split in the future.Asrian was created differently compared to other games.It was a universe simulator rather than a fixed and linear world.That meant that only when all the variables were under control could they accelerate time.If they accelerated five years without careful consideration, there was a risk of the supercomputer exploding or the game's universe being ruined.\"There's nothing we can do about it... We have to wait for the quest to end. We can do the patch once it's over, so what's the problem?\"After figuring out what the problem was, Kwon DaeHo answered very easily.But at the same time, the faces of the rest of the team darkened.\"Uhm... Chairman...? You're saying we should push on the patch date, right?\"\"What are you talking about? Why should we push it? Did you forget that talks with NFM are finished, and we even signed a contract?\"\"But we don't know when the quest will end... And from our calculations, we won't have enough time...\"\"Are we lacking on time even if we stay up all night?\"\"Understood...\"Kwon DaeHo looked at the other researchers who were silently looking at him.Behind their stern faces, there was some sort of expectation.He knew how they were feeling. After all, they'd worked together for the past few years.\"Okay, I'll also help.\"\"Yes! Doctor, you're the best!\" Mary exclaimed happily.The rest of the team clapped.They knew that if the chairman helped, they'd be able to finish any task in half the time.With the ever-burning fire illuminating their path, Hyun and Louise kept walking.Hyun looked at her once more.Even though she was wearing torn-off clothes, she didn't look normal.Yes, it was as if she was part of a royal family.From his experience, such people played an important role in the story, so Hyun asked her a few questions.\"Why do you talk in such a way?\"Louise was taken aback by the question.\"Wh... What's wrong with how I talk...?!\"\"It's weird... No matter how you look at it. These days, no one talks like that\u2014neither commoners nor noble ladies.\"\"Th-this is...! A habit from when I was little.\"\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Hyun looked at her suspiciously.No matter how many times he thought about it, he couldn't come to a conclusion, so he decided to stop thinking about it.The maze-like complex dungeon was wide and dark, but Hyun just walked without getting lost.The road became narrower; they even crossed a dangerously narrow cliff.Because they were walking through a path where monsters didn't show up, sometimes the road became dangerous.They barely managed to walk out of the cave where light didn't reach.A huge cliff stood in their way.There was no more road.The only thing standing in their way was a cliff that you couldn't figure out the ending of.Just the fear of falling made her dizzy.\"Is... this the correct road...?\"Louise looked at him with fearful eyes.In front of them, there was an abyss from where they could hear the echo.\"Yes, this is the road. I'm sure.\"Louise seemed confused at Hyun's answer.There was no place to step in front of them. What did he mean by that there was a road?\"That way.\"Hyun pointed with his finger upwards.Louise followed his finger and looked up.\u2014A cylinder-shaped cavity.At the top of the cliff, they could see a small hollow.Louise's face became pale.\"Do you know what a centrifugal force is?\"Louise shook her head.\"If we use centrifugal force, we can reach there.\"Fwoosh- As soon as Hyun finished talking, he became light and entered Louise's body.Louise knew what that meant.She had experienced it while escaping from the people following them.She was suddenly in a hurry.That's right. He was trying to enter her body to jump up there.\"No, you can't! I will not do it!\"\u300cStay still!\u300dHyun shouted through his soul, but Louise was resisting.As the movement of the two entangled, Louise's movements resembled those of a cat refusing to take a shower.\u300cHmm... Say that you're giving me control priority.\u300dTing-!In front of Louise, a message that asked if she'd give Hyun control priority appeared.\"No, no way! I will not sell you my soul anymore...! Take this evil magic away from my eyes at this very moment!\"\u300cHmm... If you press the left button, it should disappear.\u300dA few seconds later\u2026[You've received control priority!]\u300cFinally, some silence.\u300dHyun sighed in relief and walked toward the cliff.Now that she couldn't move her body at all, it seemed like Louise was about to burst into tears.Hyun could feel the tears welling up in her eyes.\"Sniff, my body has been completely taken over by a demon...!\"\u300cWho's a demon?\u300dHe could feel the wind coming from the cliff.It was understandable that Louise was scared.After all, if they fell through it, no one would be able to find her body.Of course, he was confident that wouldn't happen.Hyun stayed still while waiting for Louise to calm down.\u300cWatch closely.\u300dHyun kicked on the ground.He stepped onto the 90-degrees vertical cliff and began to spiral up the cylindrical cliff.Suddenly, the view became dark.It was Louise who had closed her eyes because she was scared.\u300cYou can't hesitate like that...\u300dAs Hyun slowed down the speed a little bit, Louise felt that her body was floating.The speed had decreased because the centrifugal force had gotten weaker.\u2018I'm falling!\u2019The force between her body and the wall was getting weaker.\u2018I'm going to die?!\u2019Louise's face became pale because of fear.But at that moment\u2026Hyun activated \u00abSteps of the Wind\u00bb and kicked the wall. Her body began accelerating and recovered its flow.\u300cSee? If the centrifugal force becomes weaker, you fall. The moment it stops, you fall.\u300dPang- Hyun stepped on the wall, and just before hitting the other wall, he stepped on it again.Like a particle spinning in a centrifuge, Louise's body climbed the walls while spinning.\u300cIf you remember the feeling, it isn't hard to do it.\u300dFrom Hyun's point of view, this 'cliff climbing' technique wasn't hard to do it.Anyone could do it as long as they got the timing right and had the guts.But it was easy by Hyun's standards. However, it was unclear how long it would take for Louise to learn it.The cavity was structured so that the higher it got, the narrower it became.Hyun increased their speed.When he was starting to feel dizzy, Louise's body had reached a flat surface.Louise was able to calm down after lying on the floor and taking a deep breath.\"Ugh... My body, my body has returned to normal...!\"Since she didn't want to get up, Hyun disassimilated from her and picked her up.After a while, they entered through an entrance in front of them.\"Where are you taking me?\"\"Just follow me, and you'll find out.\"\"I want to get out of this place...!\"\"Not yet. If we get out right now, we'll get ambushed by the opponents waiting for us to come out. Is that okay for you?\"Louise shook her head.\"Right now, there's nothing we can do, so we need to make some preparations. Do you understand?\"\"Yes, I understand...\"While walking, they noticed that the atmosphere of the place had suddenly changed.There were lanterns fueled by Mana illuminating the road.It seemed like the light was telling them the path they needed to take.\"What's this place...\" Louise asked with suspicious eyes while looking at the decor of the doorknob.It was luxurious.Only the doorknob would probably be worth more than a few hundred gold coins.The item that was as luxurious as one used by the royalty didn't fit the old and dark dungeon.\"How awkward. This isn't a trap, right?\"\"It's okay.\"Hyun grabbed the doorknob and turned it around without hesitation.Creak- The door opened and showed what was inside.It was a room that was about the size of an average cafe.Inside the room, there was some unknown sculpture; there were also lots of different weapons displayed.'This place hasn't changed at all.'A smile appeared on Hyun's face.It was a place unknown to even most rankers of Asra.\u2014The dungeon's secret marketplace.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - The Mysterious Girl (4)The place's interior wasn't luxurious as one would expect from a fantasy world. Rather than that, it was decorated with modern pieces of furniture.The atmosphere of the place resembled a modern bar.It felt alien, but that made it look more secretive.\"This place... is amazing...!\"Louise ran toward a chair and sat down. She smiled comfortably.Even if she was a noble, it would probably be her first time seeing a place with such a trendy modern atmosphere.Hyun let Louise rest for a while.\u2014A long table that reminded him of a bar.On top of it, there was a hole that resembled a vending machine where you could put in gold coins.Since the place was a secret marketplace, you could buy rare items in it.\"Hey Hyun, what's that?\"Before he had noticed, Louise had approached him and was looking with curious eyes.Hyun focused on the interface that was on top of the table.He used the buttons to select an item and then pressed okay.Wiing-A column with lenses on each side rose and began emitting a light.Lights came out from opposing directions. As both lights overlapped, a three-dimensional image appeared in the air.It had a luxurious black silhouette.An explanation about the item was shown in 3D.[ Sword of Fire (Unique) ]Wear Restriction: [Lv.200], or [Strength] + [Magical Power] more than 300.<Are you a magical swordsman?

They couldn't even grab it because of the high stat limit.He touched the table, and the image disappeared instantly.\"Oh! Why...!\"Louise looked at him with begging eyes, but Hyun ignored her and started looking at the other items on the list.On the screen attached to the table, they could see a list with hundreds of different items.There were explosives, supplies, and rare or unique items. You could even find foods like juice or steak.Since Louise looked at the food sets with intense eyes, he used one gold to buy her a kids meal set.He found what he was looking for when Louise was about to finish eating.[ The Ring of the Executioner (Rare) ]Wear Restriction: None<It's a dangerous item.

We're getting out of the dungeon soon.\"Louise's shoulders shrugged at Hyun's words.\"Right now...?\"\"No, once night comes.\"Hyun sat down on a sofa that was around there and closed his eyes.How it wrapped around him made it feel like he was sitting on a cloud.[A significant amount of tiredness has accumulated!][The moment 'tiredness' surpasses 100, the game will forcibly shut down! (Current: 97)]Asrian had a way to sleep without disconnecting from the game.While thinking about the battle they were about to engage in, Hyun fell asleep.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *In the real world, it was 3:00 pm.But the sun had just set where the dungeon was located.If they wanted to take Louise to a safe place, they had to begin moving immediately.The dungeon had five exit gates in total.Hyun had chosen the one that had the most amount of traps.At first, one would think that they were taking an unnecessary risk, but Hyun had concluded that they had more chances of safely escaping through that gate than the others.'I hope everything goes according to the plan.'He explained his strategy to Louise before moving.Her face turned pale after listening to it, but he was able to convince her.\u300cWe've almost arrived.\u300dThey soon arrived at a particular place.The dungeon's exit was a wide, round spiral staircase about 20 meters in diameter.He tilted his neck and looked up at the sky.Even though the place was underground, they couldn't see the ceiling.It was like looking at the babel tower, which people said was so tall that it used to touch the skies.There was an endless staircase at the edge of the tower....And there was still a long way to the exit.\"Is this okay?\" Louise asked while they were going up the stairs.Hyun, at first, couldn't understand what she was talking about.But then, her vision became blurry, and her body began to tremble.Tears formed in Louise's eyes.With \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, you share the other person's emotions too.When he touched the corner of her eyes, he felt some tears.They were probably Louise's.At that moment, he finally understood what she was thinking.\u300cI'm a user,\u300dHyun said while wiping the tears.I've already told you that even if I die, I actually won't.\u300dHe understood the reason why Louise refused this plan so much.It would be for the best if they could both escape together, but if they did that, they wouldn't be able to get away from the people following them.Someone had to stay behind and earn some time if they wanted to increase the probability of escaping.So Hyun had decided to sacrifice himself.A user wouldn't die in real life if he died in the game.While explaining the plan to her, Louise forcibly nodded, but now that the decisive time was coming, she seemed to be having trouble accepting it.\u300cThere's no time to think about other things.\u300dOne day, Louise would also understand that users are different.But the most important thing, for the time being, was getting out of the dungeon safely.\"Hyun...\" Louise suddenly murmured.While \u00abAssimilating\u00bb, you could even hear something said in a low tone of voice.\"I want to ask you something shameless.\"\u300cWhat...?\u300d\"It's okay if it's after you've revived. Don't you want to stay with me?\"\u300cI can't do that.\u300dHyun refused.He could feel Louise's shoulders shrugging.Hyun smiled bitterly.'But I can't say yes to something impossible.'After a few days, the main story patch would be applied to the game. In just an instant, five years would pass.But in real life, it would take just a few hours.It basically meant that there would be a discrepancy between the game and real life.Meeting Louise right after the patch would be hard.\"I see... It was something impossible...\"\u300cIf you're alive, we'll probably meet again... But it will be impossible for the next five years.\u300dHe could feel the air on her skin.\u2014It meant they were near the exit of the dungeon.He looked up.Even though they'd been walking for a while, there were still a lot of stairs left.At first glance, the cylindrical exit looked normal, but in reality, it was full of traps.If they stepped on the red stairs, some traps that would even put users above level 200 in danger would activate.Hyun walked very cautiously to avoid the traps.\u300cBe careful!\u300dPaf-!Hyun twisted her body because of the sudden strong light that came flying toward them.Something brushed past her hair.\"What's that...?!\"When he looked backward, he saw a sharp dagger on the walls.The moment he saw that, Hyun knew that the battle had already begun.'A sniper? Where?'Hyun tried to guess the direction from where the dagger had come.The opponents were hidden above in the staircase.The battle had begun suddenly.\u300cMove!\u300dPoof! Poof!Louise used \u00abSteps of the Wind\u00bb to move faster through the stairs.As she began to speed up, it looked like the wind was going up and down the stairs.But at that moment...Bang!The entire front of the staircase was destroyed.\"Ugh...\"Louise, swept away by the shock, fell to the ground while screaming in pain.If Hyun hadn't taken control, she would've probably fallen down the stairs.\u300cKeep your balance!\u300dHyun turned their body around in the air and used the wall to run. Thanks to that, Louise was able to land on the other side of the staircase.\"Ugh... A strong wind suddenly pushed me away.\"\u300cIt's a bomb.\u300dHyun clenched her teeth.It seemed like they'd concluded that it wasn't enough with ninja stars or daggers\u2014they'd brought in a weapon that could inflict damage on a very wide area.'I won't be able to block this with \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb.'The skill \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb was useful for blocking numerous small attacks, but it couldn't withstand a single attack with highly destructive power.It should be able to block the fragments of the bomb, but if the fire touched them, they'd probably die immediately.The explosions didn't end with just one.It was like they were being bombarded.Hyun instinctively jumped to the side.The moment they moved, an explosion shook the entire place.The staircase corresponding to a floor disappeared without leaving a trace.They had avoided direct contact with the explosion, but the danger hadn't disappeared.\u2014The follow-up blast after the explosion...The fragments that had scattered up were targeting Louise.'Damn...!'Hyun jumped.Most fragments passed under their feet, but some had flown upwards and were bouncing back at them.Because Louise didn't have a lot of HP, even slight damage would be critical.'We mustn't get hit.'Swing- He twisted her waist in the air.The fragments of the bomb brushed past her calf and shoulders.\u2014A few tore her clothes away.\u2014Then some cut her hair and got stuck in the wall behind them.From an outsider's point of view, it seemed as if all the attacks were flying past them on their own.It was as if she was dancing in the air.'Damn, fuck!'Hyun cursed while dodging the fragments. A third bomb was flying toward them.The new bomb exploded before they could regain balance.Boom!The flames covered Louise.\u2014An ear-drum tearing sound.\u2014Fragments of the bomb flying everywhere.Louise felt as if the world had gotten slower.\"Ah...\"Death was approaching her.All the sharp remnants of the bomb were flying toward her, and they were about to tear her down.Louise was scared of them, so she closed her eyes.'Disassimilate!'Hyun separated from Louise.Whoosh- The fragments changed direction.Hundreds of scattered pieces were centered at a single point, just like the light coming out from a convex lens.\u2014The Ring of the Executioner.It was thanks to the effect of the item that drew all surrounding attacks to the person holding it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 - Escape (1)Flap-!Hundreds of sharp pieces scratched his body.But Hyun had already activated \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb.Thanks to that, he didn't receive any damage, and it served as fuel for his \u00abVision Sword\u00bb.'Now...!'Hyun took out the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb and cut slightly into Louise's arms.Why did he suddenly attack her?Why was he damaging the one the quest had asked him to protect?It would be normal to ask these questions, but it was part of their plan.Swoosh-Louise's entire body was enveloped in the wind.It was the buff effect of 'The Blood Fairy's Frenzy.'Hyun had given Louise his robe and lowered her HP to a point just before 20%.\u300cResist a little bit.\u300dHyun used \u00abAssimilation\u00bb again.Poof!They caused an explosion in the air and used the reaction to jump as high as possible.From side to side!The stairs had a spiral form, so you could jump over an entire floor if you jumped correctly.Poof-! Poof-! Poof-!With three jumps, they went over three floors instantly.'There they are!'They saw the enemies that had thrown bombs from upstairs.These people were wearing black clothes and a mask. They had the same look like the people that had been following them yesterday.\u00abVision Sword\u00bb!Louise's tiny hands grabbed onto a giant sword made of light that didn't match her.Hyun slashed without doubting for even a moment.\u2014A blue light that cuts through space!But they failed to cut the opponent.'Disassimilate!'The light scattered away and then formed again.Hyun appeared behind the opponent.By the time he appeared behind the opponents, he was already swinging his sword.From the opponent's point of view, it probably was like being ambushed from behind out of nowhere.\"Ugh...!\"The masked man bent down instinctively.The reflexes of a level 200 Thief-related job were so incredible that it didn't look human at all\u2014it was outside of a normal human's capabilities.Even though the ambush plan was perfect, the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb cut through the air.\u00abAssimilate\u00bb!The moment he discovered that the attack had failed, Hyun \u00abAssimilated\u00bb into Louise again.All the inertia that was hanging in Hyun's body disappeared.Within a tiny lapse of time, Louise swung the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb forward.\u2014Inertia Cancel.In real life, if an attack with a big movement failed, you wouldn\u2019t be able to attack immediately after it because your center of gravity would be off, but that changed while using \u00abAssimilation\u00bb.From a physical point of view, it was as if an entity repeated 'destruction' and 'creation.'\u2014Once in front and once from behind.Since light shone from both sides, even if the opponent were fast, they'd be hit with one of the two attacks.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 26,193 damage!]The Vision Sword cut the opponent\u2019s neck.'He didn't die?'Even though the attack had been a success, Hyun was still surprised by the result.In Asrian, there was a system that if you inflicted more than 33% of the HP as damage in one hit, your opponent wouldn't be able to use the body part where the attack landed.If the enemy was alive after being hit in the neck, that meant their HP was at least a hundred thousand.Suddenly, a thought crossed Hyun's mind.'Don't tell me... These guys were named?'Paf-!Suddenly, a light came from the side.Another person was trying to cut them with a sword.Just before the sword penetrated Louise's heart, she used special steps to do a half turn.Her clothing was torn a little bit.The one that had just attacked Hyun and Louise was familiar to them.\u2014It was the first girl that had followed Louise.'So she survived...'Looking at her appearance, it seemed like she hadn\u2019t received much damage.Beep-!One of the masked men took out a flute and blew it.He didn't know what signal it was, but it definitely wasn't good news.With the sound of the flute, more masked people began appearing.Above\u2026From below\u2026He could see between three to five people.\"Ah...\"Louise took a breath of air.Her legs began trembling.Because she had previously engaged with them, she knew how strong they were.Just knowing that such strong opponents surrounded her was enough to make her lose hope.Louise's body was about to collapse.Because Hyun was using \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, he knew how Louise felt.He suddenly became annoyed.\u300cHey, do you want to die?\u300d\"U... Uh... No...!\"\u300cI'm a user, so it doesn't matter, but you're not. If you don't get a hold of yourself, you're going to die!\u300dAfter Hyun talked to her via his soul, Louise's trembling stopped slightly.\u300cRemember what I previously told you?!\u300dHyun looked upward.\u2014A spiral staircase connected to the edge of the pillar.From the end of the staircase, which was close, they could see the dungeon's exit.\u300cThe way of climbing here is the same as on the cliff. If your feet stop, you'll fall.\u300dHyun moved forward and walked to the 'Red Stairs.'It was a trap.The red stairs, red railing, red walls, and red columns\u2026Everything that was painted red was a trigger that activated traps.Tak-The moment he stepped on the first red stair, a trap activated.The stairs from the ground to the exit began crumbling like a sandcastle.Seeing such a big spiral staircase crumble in its entirety was like looking at a tall building being demolished.There were only a few staircases left.The opponents that didn't have anywhere to step began falling.But they quickly adapted and either grabbed onto the walls or created a stepping stone and used that.\u300cDon't stop!\u300dThe moment the trap activated, Louise leaped forward with everything she had.Because there weren't any staircases left, she had to run while using the walls.'It's the same as that moment!'Louise tried to remember how that previous movement felt and tried to copy it.While going to the secret marketplace, Hyun had used centrifugal force to climb up there easily.Now that they had disassimilated, she was the one that had to do it.Louise stepped on the walls while clenching her fists.With all of her might\u2026Every time she leaped, she moved approximately 10 meters.Although her movements, which were similar to vortex movements, seemed a little bit unstable, she didn't fall.\u2026But the opponents were lighter than Louise.They were stepping on the walls and moving freely. It looked as if they'd be able to catch up to Louise very quickly.She reached the place Hyun had told her right before she got into trouble.Tik-\u00a0The moment Hyun touched a red wall, another trap activated.Thuck-!Arrows were shot from the sides.There were thousands of them in number.There were so many silver lights that they were blocking vision.Although the arrows had successfully slowed the opponents, they had also put Louise in danger.The moment she was about to become a hedgehog\u2026\u00abAssimilation\u00bb! \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb!Ting!All of the arrows bounced away.\"A... Am I alive?\"\u300cStop talking and run!\u300dSwish-! From the sides, some short swords came flying toward them.Because there was some cooldown time left for \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb, Hyun used the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb.He used the sword as a shield to brush away all the incoming attacks.That had been possible because Louise's body was small.'So there's approximately 10 of them, right?'After searching for a place to hide after the staircase crumbled, he was able to count the number of enemies.'Damn, this isn't a joke!'The difficulty of the quest was too great.Usually, you were rewarded according to the difficulty of the quest, but he just couldn't understand the current situation.But Hyun quickly shook away his irrelevant thoughts.There was no time to complain.\"Use this!\"After disassimilating, Hyun gave Louise 'The Ring of the Executioner' he had bought from the secret marketplace.Louise's eyes widened.That's because she knew what the effect of that item was.\"This...?!\"It was the item she had complained about because of how cursed it was.But\u2014for the moment\u2014she followed Hyun's words without complaining.She trusted Hyun's words and decisions.As soon as she put on the ring, she could feel her heart squeezing and an unpleasant sensation spreading through her body.Yes, just as if she had been cursed.'Good, let's do it.'As Louise put on the ring, Hyun began moving.He approached a place near the red wall and pressed something.Thuck-!Thousands of arrows covered the sight.'\u00abAssimilation\u00bb, \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb!'As soon as he activated the trap, he \u00abAssimilated\u00bb into Louise.Suddenly, the view changed.'Ah...'Hyun and Louise were both lost for words.Whoosh-\u00a0The arrow was dragging in all the surrounding arrows.The sight of thousands of arrows moving by themselves just as if they were alive was too unrealistic.They couldn't see the front because it was covered with a silver light.Thousands of arrows formed a wall.The distance between them and said wall kept getting smaller...'We're going to bump into it!'Thuck thuck thuck thuck-!'Ugh...!'Hyun groaned in pain, even though he had blocked every arrow with the \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb.There was nothing he could do about it.Even though he was invincible with that skill, from a human's point of view, it was impossible to make an objective judgment in such an overwhelming situation.Three masked enemies took the opportunity to jump at them.\u00abVision Sword\u00bb.A giant sword formed in Louise's hands.But that time, it was a little bit different.The \u00abVision Sword\u00bb was bigger than before, and blue flames spouted from its blade.Hyun had never seen it do that, but it wasn't the right time to ponder it.At the same time that he used \u00abShield\u00bb, he swung the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb.The three opponents were within range and became stunned at the same time.\u2014Striking at the opponent's sword was a way to defend.Hyun took the opportunity and slashed them three more times.Every time he swung the sword, blue flames wrapped the opponents.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 153,942 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 151,534 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 149,917 damage!][By consecutively attacking the same part of the body, you've dealt more than 33% of the opponent's HP as damage!][Level up!]The result of centering the attacks on the opponent\u2019s neck was impressive.Hyun never thought he would level up after killing a single opponent.From the messages he received in his system, he guessed that the opponents should have at least a million HP\u2014they were at the level of a mid-range named monster.The enemies became warier after one of them died.Hyun disassimilated again and touched the next red wall.Clack- The trap activated again, and they were showered by a rain of arrows.Swish-![The cooldown time of\u00a0\u00abShield\u00bb\u00a0has been reset!]At the same time, eight enemies attacked simultaneously!Four of them threw daggers and ninja stars.And another four were charging toward them at a frightening speed with swords in their hands.'We only need to resist this...!'They were getting closer to the dungeon's exit.Hyun was feeling the tension.He enjoyed the slight dizziness.[The moment your 'tiredness' surpasses 100, the game will forcibly shut down! (Current: 92)]'A little bit more\u2026'The moment the opponents closed in, Hyun disassimilated and ran toward the enemies.Even though he swung the sword, they didn't try to counter it.The enemies were also learning.\u2014They'd seen their allies get stunned after hitting Hyun's sword.But even though Hyun's attack pattern was the same as before, it was slightly different.He swung it again and smashed down the sword from a higher angle.The blue flames drew a half-moon twice.First, it was small.But then, it grew bigger.\u00abShield\u00bb!Two enemies were within the attack range of the half-moon.Both were stunned!That was more than enough.Because they were going to be stunned for the next three seconds, they were going to fall deep into the abyss.\u00abAssimilation\u00bb!Hyun entered Louise's body again.He laid down the huge sword and blocked the incoming attacks.Ting-!The four that had launched long-range attacks became stunned at the same time.He saw the four of them losing consciousness and falling down the cliff.They probably would've never guessed that launching a ninja star from a distance would be enough to make them stunned.That was the great thing about \u00abShield\u00bb.'Disassimilate!'The flow of Hyun's consciousness changed many times.Such a thing was possible because he used the time by breaking it into decimal units.After Disassimilating, he appeared behind an opponent.Clang-!\u00a0The enemy became stunned after being touched with the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb.'Up to here.'In just a second, he had managed to stun seven opponents successfully.\u2014There was only one remaining.The last opponent was already charging toward Louise.'You won't dodge this!'Hyun raised his hands as high as possible and smashed down at the opponent.Clang! As the blue flames clashed with the enemy's sword, Louise's body soared high into the air because of the chain reaction.\"Oh...!\"Louise groaned slightly.Finally, she could see the exit of the dungeon.Was that how a climber who had reached the top of a mountain felt?She could feel something hot circulating through her veins.The wind that was coming from the exit was cold.It was dark outside.It was night, the sun wasn't there, and she was free from the curse.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 - Escape (2)'Good, this is perfect!'Hyun let out a delighted exclamation.It was the best possible outcome.She had reached the exit with most of the opponents stunned.\"Okay, Louise, go! If you move along the valley and erase your footprints, they\u2019ll have a hard time following you! You'll be able to find a place where the sun doesn't reach before morning!\"Hyun had previously told her that, but he reminded her again just in case she had forgotten.\"Hyun\u2026\"Just before walking out, Louise turned around.\"You\u2026\"Hyun's heart burned after seeing Louise get sentimental.Was it that she couldn't get a grasp of the situation?The opponents hadn't died. They were just stunned.\"Run, now!\"Louise\u2019s body shook at Hyun's fierce shouting.With a frustrated look on her face and about to burst into tears, she walked toward the dungeon's exit.\"Did you say five years\u2026? If I'm alive, I'd like to meet you again in that secret marketplace.\"After saying those words, she crossed the exit and disappeared.Hyun didn't look back.The opponents who had been freed from stun had made it closer to the dungeon's exit.'This is the last trap, huh\u2026'Hyun touched the red wall that was next to him.Clack- As the last trap activated, thousands of arrows poured from each side.That time they weren't dragged to a single point.That was because 'The Ring of the Executioner' was on Louise's finger.'Damn\u2026! I forgot to tell her to take out the ring! If she's wearing it while escaping, she could get into trouble\u2026 I'm sure she'll take it off on her own, right\u2026?'He realized it belatedly.\u2014That he hadn't told Louise to take off the ring.It made him somewhat anxious, but he had no other option than to wait.The most important thing was to stall for as much time as possible.'How long can I resist\u2026? If it's one minute\u2026'Hyun looked at the masked enemies that were approaching him and bluffed.He stood in front of the narrow dungeon's exit.\u2018Until I die, I won't let anyone get out of here.\u2019* * *Immediately after walking out of the dungeon, the entrance collapsed.Louise walked to the road behind and swallowed her breath.Hyun had demolished the entrance so that the people following her wouldn't be able to catch her.The moment she learned that, she wanted to cry.She wanted to stop but kept running.'You\u2026 Were really prepared to die.'Even while running, she could remember what Hyun had said.According to him, since he was a user, it didn't matter if he died, but Louise knew there was more to it than that.Dying wasn't a light matter, even for him.Despite that, he had sacrificed himself for her.'No, we will be able to meet again. There are a lot of things I wasn't able to tell him.'Louise clenched her fist and shook her head.She had to survive until then to meet again.Just like Hyun had told her, Louise followed the valley while erasing her footprints.If she discovered a dangerous monster in the distance, she waited, standing silently.She stepped on the tree branches and used her wind magic to move. After many hours of doing that, her mana reached its limit.'Ugh\u2026 This is hard.'NPCs from the game weren't that different from real human beings.If they didn't eat, they became hungry, and when they ran out of energy, they became exhausted.The vast forest wasn't somewhere a kid like Louise could explore on her own.Louise's legs were shaking as if she was about to fall.After she ran out of mana, Louise ran with her own feet, so it was normal for her to get tired.But still, she couldn't stop moving.Before morning came, she had to find a place where the sunlight wouldn\u2019t touch her.\"Ugh\u2026!\"Louise stepped on a stone and fell to the ground.Because her stamina was at its limits, she couldn't get up immediately.'Ugh, I have no time to do this\u2026 I have to keep moving\u2026'In the midst of fainting, Louise could feel the surroundings turn red.'The sun, already?'Fear rushed in.If she faced the sun there, where there was nowhere to hide, all the efforts they'd made up until then would become meaningless.She wouldn't be able to meet him again.Louise, who had lost all hope, raised her head and looked upward.\"Ah\u2026?\"Louise let out a groan.What she saw was a black sun that emitted a dark light in the middle of a red sky.From the red sky, dark light came out.Louise thought that she must be hallucinating.It felt as if she was dreaming.After the black sun illuminated her, she felt comfortable and cozy, and she ended up falling asleep.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *'I resisted quite a lot.'He tried to resist by all means possible until the end, but he soon became light and scattered away.If it weren't for the narrow dungeon's exit,\u00a0 he probably wouldn't have been able to resist even a minute.After dying, he was forced to log out. Hyun fell into a deep sleep.Just before dying, his tiredness was at 96.\u2014That meant he had been logged in for too long.Because there weren't classes that day, Hyun slept for the entire day without eating.He woke up after sleeping for almost an entire day.The sunlight was coming in through the window.'What time is it?'He checked out the clock. Twenty hours had passed.There was still a lot of time left before the death penalty ended.He also wasn't sleepy anymore because of how much he had already slept.\"Oof\u2026\"He got up while stretching his arms. The dust rose, and then it calmed down.It was silent.After taking a shower, he prepared some ramen for himself.Even after finishing his meal, he was still hungry, so he cooked one more.He turned on the computer and checked out the Asrian community.Except for the duel arena, there wasn't any new special content.He tried to do different things, but he couldn't concentrate.His head was full of what had happened the day before.\"Tsk\u2026 I only suffered losses. After dying, there's nothing I can do.\"There wasn't any reward for the quest to protect Louise.Even while complaining, SeoHyun had a smile on his face.'I wonder if she managed to escape\u2026 I guess she did\u2026? She should've been right next to the valley.'Hyun tried to calm down.Since it was something that had already passed, he had no other choice but to believe.While he was worrying about Louise, he got a message from the capsule.[You got a new message!][AIN has sent a conversation request. Will you accept?]'Ain? If it's a request to game together, I won't be able to\u2026 Since I can't log in.'There were 48 hours of penalty for dying.Only 20 hours had passed, so there was still a lot of time left.Hyun spoke to the capsule's voice recognition device.LeeSeoHyun: I died, so I can't log in today. There are still 28 hours left.Ain's voice spread through the room.AIN: What? What were you doing?LeeSeoHyun: I was trying to complete a quest alone\u2026AIN: Hmm\u2026 That's why you should've done it with me.LeeSeoHyun: You suddenly disappeared, so there was nothing I could've done about it.After receiving a call from Ain, a smile was drawn on SeoHyun's face without him even noticing it.As he talked to her, he felt that the anxiousness was fading away.AIN: But what did you do yesterday? How did you manage to level up so fast?While talking, Ain suddenly said something strange.He couldn't understand her, so he asked again.LeeSeoHyun: Level? Are you talking about me?AIN: Yes. Hyun, you're currently level 95.LeeSeoHyun: Eh? What are you talking about?Because both of them were registered as friends, they could check each other's levels whenever they wanted.But according to her, Hyun's level was 95 at the moment.'Is there something wrong?'More than being happy, he was taken aback by it.Is there a bug?Before he had died, he was at level 70.That meant that, after dying, his level had risen 25 times in one go.The only way to gain experience was either by hunting or completing quests.Because he had died, he could've only gained experience by completing a quest.'Louise?'The only possible explanation was that he had cleared the quest to protect Louise.But he was getting even more confused.\u2018That quest definitely didn't have a reward\u2026\u2019'What happened\u2026?'Then he thought of a possibility.\u2014Main Quest.It was his first time seeing those words. Was that the reason why he had leveled up so much?That was the only explanation he could come up with for the moment.'I'll have to log in to know what happened.'Hyun was hoping for it not to be a bug.He was scared of having misused a bug and having his account banned because of it.LeeSeoHyun: Leaving that aside, what are you doing?AIN: I'm in the duel arena. I'm doing a few more rounds after finishing my placement tests. Fufu\u2026 You'll probably be surprised at my record.LeeSeoHyun: That's right. The duel arena has opened its doors\u2026 Well, at least you won't get bored even if I'm not there.AIN: That's not necessarily true\u2026Hyun: Huh?AIN: Send me a message when you log in. I'll be burning some time in the duel arena!The conversation ended.SeoHyun was thinking about many things while sitting on the capsule, but he suddenly became tired again.He finally concluded that it'd be better to think about it once he could log in.Hyun decided to push back the thoughts about that for a little bit.* * *\u2014It was at the point when SeoHyun was asleep after dying.Because Hyun wasn't there, there weren't many things she could do.'Should I go to the duel arena?'In Asra, she had spent most of the time dueling. The same was true this time.[You've entered the duel arena!][The damage you receive will be reduced by 1/10 in this place!]Every city has a duel arena in it. It was a dark place that resembled a pub.The duel arena worked with a matching system and could only be used by players, So there weren't many NPCs inside the building.There was a giant portal inside the lobby, and in front of it, many users were trying to get a match.'Were there so many people in the duel arena?!'Ain's mouth was agape at sight. There were so many people gathered that it reminded her of a concert.The fact that there were so many people interested in dueling made Ain happy.The duel arena\u2026There were many matchmaking systems, but Ain was mostly interested in 1 vs. 1.After you dueled 10 times, you were put into a category depending on your skills.Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, Grand Master, and Pioneer!From bronze up to diamond, each category was divided into five more, but from Master up to Pioneer, there weren\u2019t any subdivisions. They themselves were categories on their own.Grand Master and Pioneer members were fixed at the top 1000 and top 10, respectively, so if you didn't have a talent for the game, it was a category you wouldn't be able to reach.Just reaching the category of Master was enough to be praised on the community boards.'Match register\u2026 Oh?'Ain was surprised.In the previous game, you had to wait for at least five minutes before you found an opponent, but the matching had finished in just a second.'It's fast!'The sight changed when the portal in front of her began shining.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 - The Day One of the Veils Fell Off (1)Ain was standing on top of a rock, under which there was a water current that ended in a waterfall.The falling water broke into droplets that reflected the sunlight.It was a place that one would think belonged to a martial arts novel.The map was chosen from one of Asrian's top locations, so it was a real place that existed somewhere.She could see the opponent in front of her.[vs. Louis (Bronze. 3)][Three, Two, One, Fight!]During the countdown, Ain tried to analyze the opponent.Thanks to the experience gained in Asra, she could guess the opponent's level by judging their equipment.'Hmm... He seems to be around level 20.'She got bored.In Asra, she used to be matched only with the top players; that's why she'd rarely fought someone so weak.She could do nothing about it since she hadn't been placed in a category yet.It seemed like, finally, the opponent had seen her.From his point of view, Ain must have looked like a novice\u2014even more than him.She wasn't holding any weapon, and the only protective gear she had was an old and dusty robe.Not only that, but she was a frail-looking female user!\"A kid? This is going to be an e\u2014\"He couldn't finish the sentence.Ain, who had instantly reduced the distance between them, had used flames to blow away his head.[You've won!][You've gained two battle coins!]Ain had returned to the lobby five seconds after the battle began.'What...?'Ain couldn't believe it.In the battle arena, every user's damage was reduced to 1/10. It was a system that had been put in place to avoid things like the victory being decided instantly.The damage had been locked by the system.\u2014That's why the 33% rule was rarely activated there.The fact that the opponent had died with one hit even after those debuffs meant that he had lower HP than she had expected.'It would be more fun if I could fight ten guys like this simultaneously.'Whish-Just like before, her sight changed almost instantly.The map was a forest.[vs. LenaLena (Bronze. 1)][Three, Two, One, fight!]\"Oh, I'm looking forward to a... Ugh!\"The opponent had bowed as soon as she had found Ain, but she didn't bow back.The moment she bowed, Ain reduced the distance between them by 20 meters.Even though she was level 67, thanks to the achievement bonuses gained, her stats were similar to those of a user at level 130.Basically, she had the agility of a level 130 user.The moment the claws covered in fire penetrated the opponent's chest\u2014![2nd win in a row!][You've gained three battle coins!][If you keep the winning streak, something special will happen!]Paf- Again, the battle ended as soon as it began.Another match.[vs. Sandor (Silver. 4)][Three, Two, One, fight!]Swaaa- A heavy rain began pouring in a ruin.In maps like that, where it was raining heavily, the amount of damage fire attacks dealt was reduced.But\u2026Paf- Ain stepped on the roof and then targetted the opponent's side.When the opponent noticed Ain and tried to dodge, it was already too late.Ain had already successfully landed five fire attacks by the time he activated a skill.All the people she had been fighting until then were newbies with no experience with dueling.It would be impossible for them to catch on to Ain's speed.[3rd win in a row!]* * *Ain's winning streak continued.The most amazing thing was that she had won five times in just a minute.The moment a battle was decided, she disappeared. Moreover, she went back to the lobby as soon as she finished.Because she kept doing so, she kept disappearing, appearing, disappearing, and appearing.The eyes of a user that was looking from a distance narrowed.Ain hadn't noticed it, but at a table located in the corner of the lobby, someone had seen her.'What's up with her?'It was a weird sight.Once the match was decided, it took at least a minute, even if it was short. Most matches took at least five minutes before the winner was decided.But that girl had reappeared in front of the portal almost instantly!It was hard to classify it as normal play.\"From her outfit, I\u2019d guess she's a Priest.\"Her appearance resembled the Dark Priest that had appeared on 'The Gamez.'Those past few weeks, most users who wanted to become Dark Priest were going around wearing black robes.Also, during the Count's Quest, Ain's face couldn't be seen very well because of the backlight; that's why the users hadn't noticed her.\"Isn't she an intentional deranker?\" he asked his partner, who was also looking at the girl.\"What's that?\"\"It's someone that loses on purpose to lower the ranking. Judging by how she's coming out as soon as she enters, she's clearly an intentional deranker.\"\"Why lose on purpose?\"\"She's trying to fight against only weak newbies! Because of people like that, many people who are just starting to play get demoralized!\"\"Are there many people who do that?\"\"Not really, but there are some people like that from time to time. Judging from her job, I guess she's a typical user that rides the bus to gain some free experience! People like that are always the ones who do things like this.\"He said that last thing in a higher tone of voice.Ain had just returned to the lobby after winning her 9th consecutive match. She turned her head around angrily.Behind her, some users were pointing their fingers at her.She approached them slowly.Their eyes meet.Unlike when she talked to Hyun, Ain's voice was cold and dry.\"Are you talking about me? Hmm?\"A dry tone.Ain replied shortly and looked at them.'What the...'They suddenly felt chills.But when they came back to their senses, they thought about themselves as lame.Now that they looked at her closely, she was a little girl who seemed to be a middle school student.They didn't want to admit that they'd been intimidated for a moment, so they replied back louder.\"Did I say something wrong? You're clearly an intentional deranker!\"Ain's fingers wriggled for a little bit but soon stopped.She remembered that there was a protective system in the duel arena that protected users from taking damage from other users.\"What are your ids?\" Ain asked with cold and sunken eyes.\"Why are you asking that...?\"\"Because I'm curious?\"Ain didn't try to justify herself.She also didn't talk loudly.They had only exchanged a few words, but they were starting to get anxious.They couldn't understand why she was suddenly asking for their ids.'Is there someone behind her back...?''Hey, the atmosphere isn't good... We should act as if we hadn't seen anything.'After talking to each other, they took the opportunity to get up.Ain saw them ignore her and leave the duel arena without saying anything.\"Hmm...\"Because the number of players had increased, the chances of getting into meaningless conflicts had also increased.She hated the people who talked too much despite not having skills.Ain thought it would've been great if she'd meet them outside of the duel arena.'Tsk, the flow has been broken.'She ignored the stares of other people and went to duel again.The last placing match.The moment the portal shone, her surroundings changed.Ain suddenly felt her body becoming lighter.'This...'It wasn't her imagination. Her body really felt lighter.'A satellite?'The reason why she felt that the sky was dark despite the sunlight being strong was that space could be seen from there.The reason why her body felt lighter was because of the gravity.She looked up.In the dark sky, she could see the sun and the planet 'Asra.'The scenery of the fight was one of the abandoned satellites that were floating in space.The old structure was floating in space, lonely.Although she wasn't that familiar with the place, she calmed down. The reason was that she knew where she was.[vs. Karen (Platinum. 2)][The opponent has won seven consecutive times!]More than the map, she focused on the user.'Magician's clothes... The level should be around 60.'The opponent was looking around, probably because she would've never guessed that the fight would occur in space.Ain didn't give her time and leaped immediately toward her.Maybe it was because the gravity was weak there, but just putting a little bit of strength on her ankle was enough to approach the opponent at a pretty fast speed.The moment she got near, she attacked!The flames that covered her fingers hit her opponent\u2019s chest![Critical Hit! You've dealt 312 damage!]This opponent hadn't died with just one hit.Not only that, but her reaction speed wasn't bad either.The moment she was hurt, she summoned her \u00abIce Shield\u00bb. She also used her skill \u00abEmergency Retreat\u00bb to back off.But she would've never imagined what was about to happen.Crack-! That her Ice Shield would break after just one hit!\"Ugh, what's happening...?!\"Karen shouted before her neck was cut by the fire attack.That was the last thing she said.As soon as she finished the ten matches, her rank was decided.[10 consecutive victories!][You've gained 15 duel coins!][Congratulations! You've been placed in Platinum 1!][You're currently among the top 1.3% of players! You'll be able to read more about it on the status window!]The system message kept going for a little bit.[Because you've won 10 consecutive times, the 'Battle Aura' has been activated! You'll keep it until you lose!][While the Battle Aura is activated, you'll gain twice the amount of battle coins, but your stats will be decreased by 10%!]\"Woah...!\"A red light began coming out from her body.Every time you won 10 consecutive times, the color would change, and another effect would be added.If you won 20 consecutive times, it would turn red, and if you achieved 30 successive victories, green.Of course, there weren't many users who could maintain such a winning streak.The battle aura had three effects:\u2014The first one was that you gained more battle coins.\u2014The second one was a penalty. It decreased all your stats by 10%.\u2014The third one was that if you had the battle aura, you would get the attention of everyone around you!As the colors changed, they became more intense, so you gave a tremendous presence just by standing in the lobby.\"Woah! It seems like someone has achieved 10 consecutive victories!\"As a new user with a Battle Aura appeared, the lobby became noisier.Also, the words \u201cIntentional Deranker\u201d disappeared.Thanks to artificial intelligence, someone who does something like deranking intentionally wouldn't be able to gain the Battle Aura.Although, since Ain didn't care about what other people said, that didn't matter.'I'd better get some more items.'After completing the category placement matches, Ain walked toward the battle shop.Next to the bar, many people looked at the items on display.Battle Shop\u2026It was a place where you could use your Battle Coins to buy some equipment.Ain slowly walked while looking at what was available.Because the items were displayed as a hologram, it looked like a futuristic place.Many rare and unique items were catching the users\u2019 attention.It didn't matter how strong or luxurious an item was, they didn't catch Ain's attention.Ain crossed the hallways without even taking a glance at them.She only stopped walking after reaching the place where accessories were on display.\"Ah...!\"A pair of rings.She'd been looking for that since she entered the Battle Shop.That ring with a subtle gold color felt more luxurious and mysterious than any other item.Ain took a deep breath after looking at the information window.The name of the item had caught the girl's attention.[ The Heavenly Couple Ring (Unique) ]<Limit: Rank higher than Grand Master><A ring for your soulmate>Durability 20/20- All your speed is increased by 4%.- Your Magic Defense increases by 10.- Critical Hit Damage increases by 15%. If the opponent is a user, the damage increases to 30%.- If you're with a partner with the same ring, all your stats are increased by 20%.- You can summon your partner if both of you have the same ring. (Cooldown Time: 10 minutes)- You can sense your partner's feelings.<Price: 690000 battle coins>\"Why is it so expensive?\"Ain clenched her teeth after reading the price.The number was too big.If it were back then in Asra Online, she would've been able to buy it without thinking about it twice, but at the moment, she only had 150 battle coins.But... She really wanted it!'Although one isn't enough.'She needed two rings.It was the perfect opportunity to show Hyun what she was capable of and also send him a special message.To reach her goal, she needed more battle coins.A lot more battle coins!'Will I be able to save so much?'Ain suddenly became motivated.'I can buy it! No, I'll definitely buy it!'Her eyes were shining more intensely than on other days.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 - The Day One of the Veils Fell Off (2)Ain rapidly went back to the lobby and went to the matching portal.'Register for a duel!'The map at that time resembled a circus because they were standing on top of numerous dangerous pillars.[vs. Dwen (Diamond. 5)][The opponent has won four consecutive matches!]Ain was solely focused on her opponent.It didn't matter on what map the fight was on.She just ran toward her opponent to slaughter him.The opponent was a Thief whose ranking was Diamond 5.The Thief job was great at PvP because of its speed, but\u2026Smash-!Almost instantly, Ain's claws slashed the opponent's body and destroyed him.[11th Consecutive Victory!][You've obtained 21 x 2 battle coins!]Just like the message that she'd received previously said, thanks to the 'Battle Aura,' Ain had received double the amount of Battle Coins, but in exchange, all her stats had been decreased.Even after her Agility was decreased by 10%, she was still faster than her opponent.Thanks to the achievement hunting she'd done, her stats were much higher than the average user.'Register!'Once again, another duel began. That time the scenery was an endless meadow.An opponent who looked like a Warrior was standing on top of a hill. He had a shield in front of him.[vs. Lyrak (Diamond. 5)][The opponent has achieved three consecutive victories!]Because the placing matches had ended, the speed at which the tier increased had slowed down, so she wouldn't be able to rank up as fast as before.Ain clenched her fists.That was better.If her rank increased slowly, that meant that she'd meet the stronger opponents later on, so she'd be able to more easily keep the consecutive wins.Smash!Ain's flame claws penetrated the Shield Warrior's defense.The opponent tried to resist, but he couldn't do anything against Ain, who moved extremely fast while doing feints.There was an overwhelming difference in their mobility!Ain kept constantly moving from the front to the rear of the Shield Warrior.It was hard to even keep up with her movements.It probably would've been better if he had thrown up the shield on the floor.It didn't take long before the Shield Warrior became light and scattered away.[12th consecutive victory!][You've obtained 21 x 2 battle coins!]'The couple ring...'Ain didn't take a rest and kept dueling.[vs. Rewrite (Diamond. 3)][You've won!][vs. Kakar (Diamond. 4)][You've won!][vs. Datra (Diamond. 3)][You've won!]...Ain kept dueling as if she was someone that was crazy about fighting.Some matches ended very easily, in other matches, the opponent used their ultimate attack, so the battle dragged on a little bit, but every single one ended up with Ain's victory.She was in a kind of trance.The only thing she cared about was defeating the opponent in front of her.[20th consecutive victory!]Ain got the system message at the same time the energy surrounding her became yellow.[The 'Battle Aura' has become stronger!][The amount of Battle Coins you can obtain has increased by another 3 times, and all your stats are decreased by another 10%!]The number of battle coins she could obtain was six times the amount, and all her stats would be decreased by 20%.The risk had increased, but the rewards had risen too.\"Hmm? What...?\"Everyone had turned their heads around because a yellow aura had suddenly appeared, but when everyone had noticed it, Ain had already disappeared.\"Didn't something shine next to us?\"\"Yes, I also noticed it!\"\"Did someone level up? But this isn't a hunting ground...\"While there was a little bit of disturbance in the lobby, Ain had appeared in a place that resembled a palace and was facing her opponent.[vs. X-Kaiji (Diamond. 2)]Now her opponents were among the top Diamond rank users.Even though they were part of the top 1% of players, the lower the number became, the stronger they were compared to others.[Three, Two, One, fight!]The opponent was an axe-wielding Warrior.The axe had high base damage, but because of their weight, getting back to a fighting position after using them was hard.Ain used that point to her advantage.The moment she pretended to charge forward and then moved to the side\u2026Swing- The ax flew across the air while making a loud noise.'Now!'Through a feint, she made the opponent move first.Once he fell for the trap, she leaped toward him![Critical Hit! You've dealt 333 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 352 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 317 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 351 damage!][Because you've attacked the same body part in a row, you've dealt more than 33% of its HP as damage!][You've melted down his leg!]After she attacked the leg four consecutive times, she melted it down.She could see the astonishment in the eyes of the opponent who was falling down.He had thought that his attack had been a success, yet he could feel his body falling.Even after looking at the status window, he didn't know what had happened.He couldn't understand why his attack had failed.He also couldn't understand how his opponent had been able to attack the same body part four times in a row in that short time frame.\"Ugh... Damn it!\"The fact that he was missing a leg meant that he couldn't fight anymore.He soon became light and scattered away.[21st consecutive victory!][You've obtained 28 x 6 battle coins!]* * *Paf-!Another match.At the top of a very high tower, Ain faced a new opponent.[vs. Telepass (Diamond. 2)][The opponent has achieved three consecutive victories!]The wind was blowing.The top of the tower was too narrow for the two of them to move freely.It felt as if they were on top of a boxing ring.The only difference was that there was a cliff on the edge of the ring.\"...\"The user Telepass was pointing his great sword toward Ain.Ain could feel that the opponent in front of her was stiff.The opponent also could see how many consecutive victories she had achieved... So he wouldn't rush in without thinking about it twice.If you won against an opponent with a Battle Aura, you could obtain extra Battle Coins.For example, if you could win against an opponent that had won 20 consecutive times, you could earn 1000 extra bonus coins.So it wasn't just the user who had achieved the consecutive victories that had to be serious; the opponent had to be, too.The opponent probably really wanted to win against her.'I can't lose against someone like him!'Ain couldn't afford to lose even once if she wanted to buy the item she'd been longing for.Whoosh-!A red aura began coming out from the opponent's body.It was an ultimate attack that increased attack and speed instantly.Swing-!The greatsword covered with a blood-red light cut some of Ain's hair.Next, it brushed her ribs.After that, he tried to cut her body, but Ain wasn't there.Swoosh! Once again, he leaped toward her, but he missed that attack too.He couldn't hit her.She wasn't dodging after looking at his attack.With a user\u2019s 'Agility,' it was impossible to look at an attack and dodge it from a short distance.She was using her own movements to limit the opponent's attack path. Thanks to that, she was able to guess the next attack path.That's how she was dodging and then hitting him with flames.When the opponent took a defensive stance, she had already landed three attacks on him.Ain smiled maliciously.\"This is too obvious.\"\"Ugh...! This damn brat!\"Swing!It didn't matter how much he swung the greatsword. He couldn't land a single attack.Whenever the opponent missed an attack, she landed one or two attacks on him and then backed off.Continuing the cycle of attacking and then backing off was the best way to take advantage of one's superior Agility.The Warrior kept trying to resist until his HP dropped to zero, became light, and scattered away.[22nd consecutive victory!][You've gained 28 x 6 battle coins!]Suddenly, her opponents began using ultimate attacks with a long cooldown time.They all wanted to cut her consecutive win strike.Ain preferred that.Because even after that, the results wouldn't change at all.She had the most fun when the skillful opponents did everything they could, yet she still found it easy.[25th consecutive victory!][26th consecutive victory!][You've won against 'Izuna Haruko' who had won 12 consecutive times. You've earned 200 x 6 Battle Coins as extra!]From time to time, she won against users that had won more than 10 consecutive times, so she earned a lot of bonus coins.Ain's smile deepened when she won against a user on a winning streak.And then, the color of the aura that was surrounding Ain changed.[30th consecutive victory!][The amount of Battle Coins you can obtain has increased by another 4 times, and all your stats are decreased by another 10%!]The aura surrounding Ain became green. At the same time, her category increased.[You've obtained the category 'Master'!][You're currently among the top 0.053% of players.]The system message kept going for a while.She just ignored it and began dueling again.[33rd consecutive victory!][34th consecutive victory!][35th consecutive victory!]The more her tier increased, the harder it became to win.Most battles began taking more than one minute, and some even took her three minutes.She was starting to feel the debuff.Because her Agility had decreased, her speed had become slower too.And because her Magical Damage had decreased, the amount of damage she dealt had been reduced together with it.Not only that, but her HP had also decreased because of her Vitality going down.Even after all these debuffs, her stats were still higher than the rest... But once she reached the 40th consecutive victory, she wouldn't be able to overwhelm the rest with her stats.[38th consecutive victory!][39th consecutive victory!][You've won against 'Level Max' who had won 11 consecutive times. You've won 200 x 24 battle coins as extra!]And finally\u2026[40th consecutive victory!][The amount of Battle Coins you can obtain has increased by another 5 times, and all your stats are decreased by another 10%!][The amount of Battle Coins you can earn has maxed out and won't increase anymore!]Whir-Ain's body was covered by an intense blue light.Up until then, the aura had shone as intensely as a lamp, but that one was reminiscent of a sun.As Ain, who had finally achieved 40 consecutive victories, appeared in the lobby, everyone's attention became focused on her.\u2014A girl that looked like a sun.\"Woah, what's that?\"\"That's a Battle Aura. But it's my first time seeing a blue one!\"\"That's crazy! She's won 40 consecutive times?\"A few people realized something after analyzing Ain for a while.Ain's face had been shown on The Gamez's broadcast. That's why some people recognized her.\"Wait, isn't she the Dark Priest?\"\"Oh, now that you say it...!\"By the time someone clapped and turned around, Ain had already disappeared.* * *Those days, JaeHoon had spent a lot of time in the Duel Arena.Except for the team's basic schedule, he spent all his time at the Duel Arena.He was so immersed in it that he reached the Master Tier.JaeHoon... No, Practice's skill had improved a lot after analyzing the Dark Priest's video.The more he used what he had practiced in the Duel Arena, the more polished they became. And with that, his victory rate increased too.'If things go on like this, I should be able to reach Grand Master. Right?'That wasn't a vain delusion.After all, Practice had won on the Master Tier 21 consecutive times!As he entered the city's Duel Arena, his body got covered by a yellow aura.That was the 'Battle Aura' he had obtained after winning more than 20 consecutive times.\"Woah, yellow!\"\"20 consecutive wins, that's amazing... Weren't you in Master Tier?\"Practice had become someone well known in that city's Battle Arena.It's not that he wanted to brag about it, but because he kept dueling constantly, many people had started to recognize him.He had also received some offers to join different parties or guilds, but he had to refuse them all because he was already part of a professional gaming team.'Okay, should I duel today too?'As soon as the opponent was decided, a map was picked randomly.Transparent tiles had been laid on an infinite floor.It was a map called 'Endless Plane.'Just like its name indicated, it was somewhere that resembled a space where there were an endless amount of transparent tiles on the floor.'Oh, this map is great.'That was Practice's favorite map.The empty place that didn't have any obstacles was perfect for trying out new techniques.While he was thinking that, the opponent appeared.[vs. Ain (Master.)][The opponent has won 47 consecutive times!]What?Practice thought that he had misread it.Was it even possible to win 47 consecutive times in the Master category?No, based on the consecutive wins, that person probably came straight from the lower categories.Even so, it just didn\u2019t make sense.'Ranker...? It's an ID I've never seen in the Hall of Fame.'He had been lucky to achieve 20 consecutive wins. It was in part thanks to his skill improving a lot. The opponent's jobs helped out too.Also, from then onwards, all his stats would be decreased by 20%, so he wasn't sure he would be able to keep up the winning streak.But this person had won 47 consecutive times...\"Ah...!\"His pupils widened after looking at the opponent who was covered by a blue aura.A small height and black robes\u2026And a slight smile on her face.In front of him, there stood a girl whose sight he knew very well.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 - The Day One of the Veils Fell Off (3)'This person...!'Practice grabbed his sword even tighter.Oof...Practice took a deep breath and tried to calm down.He wanted to take it easy on his first match of the day, but that thought was blown away.\u2018She's called Ain...?\u2019It was his first time seeing her, but he felt very used to it.It was as if she was his master, after all.'So there's someone in Master who has won more than 20 consecutive times!'On the other hand, Ain was also excited at the sight of Practice.The yellow aura coming out from Practice's body looked like delicious bonus coins to her.If she beat an opponent who had achieved 20 consecutive victories, she would get a thousand coins.On top of that, if she added all the extra bonuses, she would be able to earn 120000 coins at one time!Anyone would get excited.'Practice? What a weird name.'Ain's eyes were different than usual.Unlike the opponents she had fought against, Practice was standing in a weird position. His sword was pointing toward his feet.Somehow, that looked sharper.Ain was thinking that when Practice leaped toward her suddenly like a spring bouncing.A sharp thrush split the air.Ain dodged it diagonally.But then, something amazing happened.Clang-![You've received 23 damage!][You've been poisoned! Every 10 seconds, you'll receive 5 extra damage! The effect lasts for 300 seconds!]'Hmm...?'Ain could feel her shoulders throbbing.Except for an ultimate attack, while maintaining 47 consecutive wins, she'd never received a hit.'This movement?!'Ain looked at Practice, surprised.\u2014Changing the direction twice just before stabbing an opponent with a long-range attack.It was a movement she was used to.Changing directions mixed with feints\u2026It was a technique she frequently used while fighting.'His fighting style is similar to mine?'Ain smiled.Should she test him?Just in time, the opponent attacked again. Ain made a big movement to the side.At that moment\u2026Whish-! The opponent also moved to the same side!Practice was moving just as she'd thought.[You've received 22 damage!][The poison increased! Every 10 seconds, you'll receive 10 extra damage! The effect lasts for 300 seconds!]In real life, it would probably be impossible to change the direction to a vertical blow while stabbing an opponent.But thar place was Asrian\u2014you could move in such ways that you wouldn't be able to in real life.'I was right!'Ain was sure about it.He was using the same moves she'd been using since Asra.The only difference was that he was using a sword, but the movement was the same.\"Did you play Asra?\"Ain asked him.To use those movements freely, he had probably worked a lot.It was a technique that required a lot of practice. You needed to move very fast, and if you didn't have a delicate sense, you could suffer damage.\"Weird. I don't remember that ID.\"Ain tried to remember, but she couldn't. It was normal. After all, Practice had never played Asra Online.\"This is my first time...\"\"Really? How strange.\"\"Uhm... Could I register you as a friend?\"\"Hmm?\"Ain's smile deepened.How he used her movements and wanted to register her as a friend... He was an interesting fellow.But Ain had no intention of registering as a friend another man that wasn't Hyun.Ain used the same answer she'd used many times during Asra Online.\"I'll let you if you beat me.\"\"...!\"The fight resumed immediately.Practice tried to stab again, and Ain dodged diagonally.It was the same situation as before.Practice's eyes shone.Just as his body remembered, he tried to attack while changing the direction.[Critical Hit! You've received 310 damage!]Practice was about to change the direction of his attack toward the opponent when his sight shook.'What?!'He had moved exactly the same way, but the result was completely different.He stood up after rolling up on the ground. Then he finally understood what had happened.He wasn't able to stab.Before he could do it, the opponent had countered his attack.Ain smiled at the dumbfounded Practice.'If I block the attack before you change direction, you won't be able to do anything.'The movements Practice was using were hers in the first place.So finding the exact point when the direction was changing wasn't hard.Once she got the timing right, she could take advantage of his mental state to attack.She could easily read his next movements.However, from Practice's point of view, before he understood Ain's movements, he was just getting beaten up unilaterally.Usually, Ain would end the match as soon as the opponent fell, but she waited for him to recover his balance and stand up.'How did she read my movements?'Practice began wondering while trying to recover his balance.He tried but failed at finding an answer.Then, there was only one thing he could do.He had to move in a more polished way!Whish-!* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *But the moment he tried to stab, Ain's fingers shone.The only thing Practice could see was a system message.[Critical Hit! You've received 289 damage!]He was lying on the ground.Claws made of fire had scratched him.Practice stood there dumbfounded for a while.He just couldn't understand how he was being countered.'He can't deal with this, huh...?'Ain turned off the flames while making a wry smile.From a certain point, the battles became psychological more than anything.That was because the movements were too fast for the human eye.Ain had tried to analyze Practice's current status.He had just learned how to move, but it seemed like he didn't understand very well how to fight in Asrian.If he knew that she was waiting for him to change directions and counter it, he could've induced her to do it and then countered her attack.The reason why he couldn't do that was probably because of his lack of experience.'It seems like he has learned it by chance. Or maybe\u2026 did he study it alone?'Ain's guess was right.It hadn't been a week since Practice had started to analyze her movements after seeing the video.Also, he had never received the feedback of another person, so he had reached the Master category thanks to his own analysis.That had been enough up until then, but those movements that weren't polished enough were instantly destroyed by Ain.[Critical Hit! You've received 301 damage!]Ain kept countering Practice's attacks the same way.Just like a deja vu, the same scene kept repeating over and over again.[Critical Hit! You've received 299 damage!]The moment his sword changed direction, his chest became covered with fire.Practice clenched his teeth and swallowed a groan.Except for the first two times, he hadn't been able to land a proper attack on her.All his attacks were being blocked before he could even make them.'There's nothing I can do...!'As his only attack had been completely sealed, he became powerless.He couldn't even do a simple stab, so there really was nothing he could do.What did he have to do in order to avoid being countered?Yes, the problem is with the timing.\u2018If only my attack isn't blocked...!\u2019\"Do you think you'll succeed if your attack isn't cut off at the middle?\"Practice raised his head after hearing Ain's voice.\"Try to attack me once more,\" Ain said while moving her fingers.Practice nodded and lowered his sword again.He knew that there was a huge difference between their abilities, so he didn't insist on his pride.He tried to stab her once more.He changed direction twice.Ain didn't move from her place.'Did it reach her?'He was targetting her left shoulder.But the moment when he thought that his attack had been a success\u2026[Critical Hit! You've received 329 damage!]He couldn't believe it, but he had missed the attack.In just an instant, she had backed off one meter and then returned.It was as if he was looking at something that only appeared in martial arts movies.'Ah...!'Practice was thrilled.That kind of amazing gameplay was why he had dreamed about becoming a professional gamer.\"You can't win, see?\"She just remained still in her place.It was as if she was inviting him to attack as much as he wanted.Practice nodded and then leaped toward her.But the result didn't change.As soon as he tried to stab, Practice felt like he was being sucked into the counterattack.The short movement of backing off and then a brief dash was so perfect that it could be mistaken for a skill.[Critical Hit! You've received 291 damage!]He knew she wasn't continuing her attack on purpose.Yes, she was going easy on him.Despite all that, there was nothing he could do.He felt as if there was a great wall between them.It was his first time feeling this since he began playing Asrian.He never thought that he'd be so overwhelmed by the controlling abilities of an opponent rather than the specs.It felt as if it didn't matter what he did, he would never be able to touch her.What was even more amazing was that every attack ended up being a critical hit, even while moving so fast.'Were her skills above what she'd shown on the video...?'Now that he'd fought her, he became sure about something.\u2014He wouldn't be able to beat her.Practice was confident that he wouldn't lose easily against anyone with similar specs, but it was the first time that he didn't think that.He had no chance of beating her.'I need to learn more...!'After realizing the difference between them, most people would just give up, but Practice wasn't like that.He wanted to reach her level. That ambition was what allowed him to become a professional gamer.A professional gamer with more experience he knew had said something like this:\u201cYour life as a professional gamer is over the moment you lose confidence in yourself.\u201d\u201cYou need to think that you'll eventually be able to beat anyone.\u201dAin looked at Practice, whose HP was about to reach the bottom.Winning was impossible.'I should wrap things up, right?'It had been a long time since he found someone fun, but she didn't have time to lose in order to earn more coins.Ain approached Practice to smash him with her fire claws.It was to finish him off.\"Hmm...?\"Ain's eyes widened.Practice backed off a few centimeters and then moved forward\u2014it was as if he was trying to copy her move.Unfortunately, he couldn't copy it perfectly.He had leaped forward before the trajectory of her attack had ended.Practice trying out a new attack was like a fire moth jumping right into the fire.[48th consecutive victory!][You've earned 62 x 120 Battle Coins!][You've won against 'Practice,' who won 21 consecutive times. You've earned 1000 x 120 Battle Coins as extra!]Even after returning to the lobby, Ain couldn't brush off the uncomfortable feeling.Rather than her winning the match, it was as if he had committed suicide.\"Well, since I've won, I guess it really doesn't matter.\"For some reason, she thought that she would remember his ID.* * *A few hours before\u2026Ain was rapidly going through the Diamond category.Tarr Tarr was also dueling in the same category.Tarr Tarr.He was the middle school student who had uploaded Hyun and Ain's footage of killing the hidden named Leopard to Youtube.The number of views that the video gained had stopped at 8 million.From the moment he learned that the people who appeared on that video were users, he had deleted the footage.After that, he'd been looking for the people that appeared in them for a while.People around him had said that it would be better to find the two that appeared in that video. That way, he would be able to explain the situation to them.But meeting both of them was harder than he initially thought.'Am I going to be able to meet them again?'Tarr Tarr had just filmed the footage. He didn't even know their names.He was wondering about that when suddenly\u2026!The first clue was the Count's Quest.That incident had become very famous in Korea. That's why even he had heard about it.The moment he saw the Dark Priest who had appeared as the gates guardian, he knew it was her.'It's that person!'But by the time he noticed that, it was already too late.When he reached the place where the battle was taking place, it had already ended. Not only that, but there weren't any spectators left.He'd blown up a lot of money in teleporting in vain. That made him sad for a few weeks.But who would've guessed it?He never thought he'd be able to meet her like this![vs. Ain (Diamond. 4)][The opponent has won 16 consecutive times!]She appeared on a duel map that was set on a deserted island.\u2014A small girl with a black robe.Her hair reached her shoulders.The moment he saw her characteristics, he knew it was her.'She's here!'Tarr Tarr came to his senses.He'd finally found one of the protagonists of the video.He was so moved that he remained still for a moment.[Three, Two, One, fight!]But unfortunately, Ain's mind at that moment was only focused on earning as many Battle Coins as possible.The moment the countdown ended, Ain reduced the distance between them. Her hands were covered with fire.\"Oh, wait...\"Tarr Tarr, who noticed something was wrong, tried to say something, but her hands were faster.The fire on Ain's hands began burning Tarr Tarr.As he began feeling his body was being burned with a very hot dryer, he thought his soul was about to disappear.Even during that situation, he tried to say something.\"Wait, please!\"[You've received more than 33% of your HP as damage in the same body part! Your left chest melted down!][You've lost!]Just a few seconds after the battle began, Tarr Tarr was already back in the lobby of the Duel Arena.Ain tilted her head at the last minute.'Hmm? It seems like he wanted to say something.'But that thought soon faded away.She was sure that the only thing he could say in that situation was to beg for his life.If you were going to beg for your life in the Duel Arena, you shouldn't be dueling at all...!Ain was cool-headed.She soon forgot that had happened and kept dueling.At the same time\u2026Far away in the lobby of the Duel Arena, Tarr Tarr was agonizing while grabbing his hair.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - The Day One of the Veils Fell Off (4)[You're currently ranked 998!]After winning 48 consecutive times, Ain entered the Grand Master category.And after reaching 50 victories, the Aura changed from blue to purple.[All your stats have been decreased by another 10%!]The extra Battle Coin bonus was at its maximum rate, 120, so it didn't increase anymore.There was a limit to it even in Asra, so she didn't complain.Right then, Ain was accumulating Battle Coins at a frightening speed!To understand how she had earned so much, one needed to understand the reward system better.In the bronze category, you received 2 or 3 coins per win. In Diamond, the reward was between 30~40. But once you entered Master, you received approximately 60.In the Grand Master category, you received more than 100 coins per victory.On top of that, you needed to add the 'Battle Aura' bonus.For example, if you earned 100 coins and had an x120 bonus, you'd receive 12000 coins.You also couldn't ignore the bonus that defeating users that had achieved 10, 20, or even 30 consecutive wins gave.After all, each one gave 200, 1000, and 3000 coins!As a result of battling constantly, Ain had accumulated an enormous amount of Battle Coins in her inventory that made her smile.<Battle Coins: 701830>'I can buy one.'Ain's speed of earning Battle Coins was unbelievably fast.Even users that spent all their day dueling rarely earned more than ten thousand coins in one day.Taking into consideration the Grand Master category, if you earned 100 coins per battle, you had to win at least 100 times.Even if your win rate was 50%, you had to battle at least 200 times. And what if each battle took three minutes?You had to keep fighting for 10 hours without taking a rest.Also, thanks to the advanced Artificial Intelligence, if it concluded that someone was an Intentional Deranker, that person wouldn't be surrounded by the Battle Aura. That was why earning Battle Coins was so hard.How people viewed her had changed too.Because she had a purple aura surrounding her, everyone moved away from her path the moment she began to walk.Most people knew their place. If they concluded that someone was in another league, they just looked from a distance.Ain didn't care about the attention she was getting. She entered the shop to buy the couple\u2019s ring.\"I want that.\"Ain's short words caused a lot of commotion.The buzz of the users and the reaction of the manager, who was an NPC, was worthy of seeing.The amount of Battle Coins Ain had surpassed logic.Clack- A few users took pictures or videos of Ain buying the unique ring.'Hmm?'But in Asrian, because of how similar it was to real life, privacy was a serious matter.After hearing the sound of people taking screenshots and seeing the video recordings flash, she turned her head around.\"Did you just take a picture of me?\"\"Ah...\"The user who had made eye contact with Ain froze.Recording another user in the game wasn't illegal per se, but some people might dislike it.If the other person who was definitely ranker began having a grudge against him, he would be in trouble.\"Sh... Should I delete it...?\"\"I'm feeling good today, so I'll let it slide,\" Ain said while going out of the shop with a smile on her face.She was wearing on her finger the ring she had just bought.Before the consecutive win rate was broken, she wanted to buy one more of it.She could earn 120 times more coins per victory.But her stats had been reduced by 50%!As her stats had plunged from being comparable to those of a level 130 user to one at 65, she couldn't relax.In the Grand Master category, there probably wasn't anyone who had fewer stats than her with the penalty applied.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator - Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *On Reddit's biggest Asrian community, one thread became a trending topic almost instantly.<Who is Ain?>There were many people who had been looking at Ain since she achieved 40 consecutive victories. There were screenshots that showed her with a blue aura and then the purple one.The moment her name appeared on the Grand Master list, her name was covered with a purple light that showed that she'd won 50 consecutive times.That basically meant that she'd entered the Grand Master territory by winning 50 consecutive times.\u300cHow is it possible that she hasn't lost even once? I guess there was some sort of luck involved in it, too.\u300dThat commentary summarized what most of the users thought.Asrian's battle system made it possible that a newbie could win against a more experienced player.If you made small consecutive mistakes, you could lose half of your HP instantly.Even master users in platinum tended to lose at least 1 match out of 10.\u300cNo, it's pure skill. I've seen Bishop Man's stream. He just couldn't do anything against her.\u300dAin's existence had become known to the public thanks to her match with a famous streamer 'Bishop Man.'Bishop Man was a level 84 Thief who had become the first person to achieve the Grand Master category as soon as the Battle Arena opened its doors.He was a popular streamer among girls because of his looks, skills, and how he just silently dueled.Although he had lost some viewers after losing against Ain, he was still a popular streamer.\u300cWhere's everyone who used to say that Bishop Man wouldn't lose on a one vs. one match against Lattice?\u300d\u300cThe truth is that he didn't last even five minutes against a girl no one had heard about.\u300dBecause it was a big community, some users had recognized Ain.\u300cIsn't that girl famous too? She looks like the girl who fought against the Darkness Guild... There's no way Bishop Man would be able to win against someone who beat Darkness.\u300d\u300cThat was an NPC! She's a completely different person!\u300d\u300cBishop Man's fans are now making an NPC human, lol. Stop shielding him so much. The one that hunted down Darkness was an NPC.\u300dThe opinion on the threads was divided into two.Was Ain a new player they'd never seen?Or was she the Dark Priest that had defeated Darkness?Previously, after a long discussion, people on the boards had concluded that the Dark Priest was an NPC.But because someone who had the same job and skill set had appeared, some people said they should reevaluate the previous conclusion.\u300cI think they're the same person.\u300d\u300cNo, let's think about it reasonably. At that point, Lattice still hadn't reached level 100 yet. You need to be at that level to change jobs. What I want to say is that Ain and the Dark Priest that fought against Darkness are two completely different people.\u300d\u300cBut take a closer look! Look at the footage Bishop Man uploaded. Even the skills are exactly the same...\u300d\u300cThat's because she's also a Dark Priest. There are already five people who have surpassed level 100, didn't you know? If she also changed her job to a Dark Priest, she also can use the same skills...\u300d\u300cBut on the Hall of Fame, among the people that did the job transfer, there isn't anyone with the ID of Ain.\u300dThe buzz didn't seem to end because the user's level was hidden on the Battle Ranking, unlike the Hall of Fame.\u300c There are a lot of users who haven't registered yet!\u300d\u300cFriends. Don't you think that there are too many coincidences? I also believe that they're the same person. Their appearance is very similar too.\u300d\u300cWhy are Bishop Man's fans so stupid? She's probably cosplaying to look identical to that Dark Priest. After all, you can customize your looks as you wish in this game!\u300d\u300cWell, at least now we know that even among rankers, there are many people who play in silence!\u300d\u300cThat's true. Even if she's not that Dark Priest, she isn't someone who can be taken lightly. Because she's over level 100, it's understandable that Bishop Man lost.\u300d\u300cI agree. The only reason why everyone is criticizing him now is because of his popularity!\u300dDarkness Guild.The commotion Ain had caused had reached their ears.They also knew that people were discussing if they were the same person or not on Reddit.Mayday finally spoke after looking at the Bishop Man's video for a while.\"I... Think that she's a little bit different.\"Mayday frowned.She had previously fought against the Dark Priest.The despair she had felt that day was greater than that.\"I also think the same!\"Pias also agreed with what Mayday said.\"Her movements are different from before. How should I say it... It's almost as if there are more gaps in her movements? Of course, she's still great. But previously, it was as if we were fighting against a machine.\"\"Yeah, I also felt the same!\"Mayday spoke while clapping.\"Also, the Dark Priest from that time was someone who looked like a frighteningly cold-blooded person... But this person, on the other hand, is more aggressive.\"\"Yes, their battle style is too different.\"\"Exactly.\"Mayday still remembered that day vividly.While battling, she had done her best to launch a surprise attack, but the dark priest had easily dodged them all. It was as if she had eyes in every direction. Not only that, but she had smiled at her.That frighteningly cold attitude couldn't be seen in the video.Instead of that, she could feel a strange sense of madness in her... She was too different from the person she remembered.\"But except for that, there are too many similar things. Her looks, her clothes... Honestly, I'm having a hard time concluding.\"Mayday's confusion was understandable.Who would have thought that the Dark Priest of that day was actually Hyun and Ain fused together!It had been an impossible task to figure out Ain's real identity from the beginning. After all, they didn't know about the \u00abAssimilation\u00bb skill.\"Hmm, I see...\"The guild's leader, XL, had his arms crossed.XL's specialty was strategizing, but he didn't know many things about top rankers\u2019 movements or characteristics.\u2014That's why he left some decisions to the guild's top rankers.From his point of view, they were clearly the same person, but Mayday and Pais saw some differences in their playstyle.As his doubts deepened, the guild's vice leader Reina, poked XL's stomach.\"Hey, why are you thinking about it so much? Even if they aren't the same person, it would be great if we could make her join us. Right?\"\"Yeah, that's right.\"After nodding, XL decided on what they should do next.First, they had to meet her.Once they met with her, they could ask her directly.Then\u2026 the fastest way should be to go directly to the Duel Arena.\"How many Grand Masters do we have in our guild?\"XL asked while looking at Mayday and Pias. But somehow, the room became silent.\"Hmm... I'm not sure.\"\"I've never been to the Duel Arena because I've been busy hunting.\"\"Hmm, although I'm at one of the top positions in the Master category... I don't duel that much...\"Pias seemed to be the only one with the rank of Master.Because PvP wasn't XL\u2019s specialty, he was only ranked gold.Because of a Priest's characteristics, Reina couldn't easily obtain a high ranking in one vs. one combat.\"I've heard that 'Dancing Slayer' is a Grand Master, but he doesn't seem to be online right now.\"\"What about the other guild members...?\"\"Hmm... Probably...\"Thump- Reina, who was annoyed, hit the desk.\"How is it possible that the number one ranking guild can't incorporate a single Grand Master?\"Reina turned her head around and looked at Pias as if he were prey.\"Then, Pias, get to Grand Master ranking as soon as possible.\"\"Me?\"\"Yes, in you're in the latter half of Master, you should be able to easily reach Grand Master.\"\"Today, after the meeting, I've arranged to go hunting with\u2014\"\"So?\"Reina's sharp eyes applied a lot of pressure on Pias.Cold sweat dripped from Pias.\"No.... I'll do it. Duel...\" He mumbled.With a sullen face, Pias walked toward the city's Duel Arena.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 - The Day One of the Veils Fell Off (5)Pias had remained in the Master category because he wasn't very interested in dueling, but because he was skillful, he could rank up whenever he wanted.After all, he was the number 23 player in the Hall of Fame!Until a few weeks prior, he had been in 9th place, but after dying and not being able to log in for two whole days, his rank had gone down.[You're currently ranked 999!]'Good!'He reached the Grand Master category after dueling for 30 minutes.He had won 11 times and only lost twice!Because the game's tempo was so fast, even expert players died from time to time after making some mistakes.The winning streak Pias was maintaining was actually very good.'Now, I just need to wait for her.'Even though it was just another duel match, Pias's heart was racing fast.\u2018Is she really the girl from that day? Or is she not?\u2019Previously, he had said that both had a different fighting style, but the truth was that he wasn't completely sure.It was hard to believe that there were two users that had such a unique style.'I guess I'll know the answer once I meet her!'Two hours after reaching the Grand Master category, Pias faced an unexpected problem.'Why can't I meet her...?'After reaching the Grand Master category, Pias had fought more than 20 times, yet he hadn't met anyone with the ID 'Ain.'A certain thought crossed his head.'Maybe, even though we're both Grand Masters, the system matches you against others with a similar ranking?'Currently, he was placed 972 in the rankings, but there was no way to know what her placement was.No, actually, there was one way to know it.\u300cWhat is Ain's current ranking?\u300dPias asked through the guild chatting window.\u300c969, but why? Haven't you found her yet?\u300dSomeone answered him immediately after checking the rankings.He was confused.They were almost at the same ranking, yet he wasn't able to find her.\u300cShe's been at the 969 ranking for a while. Maybe she's taking a rest?\u300d\u300cHey, it just changed!\u300dThe moment Ain's ranking changed, someone shouted through the guild chatting window.\u300c965th place! Start a match now!\u300dPias immediately requested a new duel.After reaching the Grand Master category, normally, it took 30 seconds to find a partner, but right then, an opponent had appeared a second later.'Was it a success?'In front of Pias, a calm land covered by ice appeared.The cold air gave him a few goosebumps.After looking around, he saw an opponent.\u2026But the system message appeared first.[vs. Ain (GrandMaster.157point)][The opponent has won 53 consecutive times!]'She's here!'Pias's mind lit up.After seeing her, he immediately messaged through the guild chatting.\u300cI've met her!\u300d\u300cWhat?! Turn on the stream!\u300dIt was the strategy Darkness had decided just in case they met Ain.If they made Pias start streaming, the rest of the guild could see what was happening in real-time.XL, Reina, Mayday, Bear Shield, and other top members of Darkness entered Pias's streaming.After the stream began, the first thing that they could hear was Ain's voice.\"I've met you before, right?\"The moment Ain mumbled those words, the chatting window of the guild went up a page.\u300cSee? She's the same Dark Priest!\u300d\u300cYou're right. See how she remembers Pias's face.\u300d\u300cTry to make her join us. First, ask her if she's part of any guild!\u300d\u300cEveryone, calm down. I'll be the only one talking.\u300dThe Darkness Guild's leader changed the permissions so that only he and the vice-leader could speak.\u300cPias, first let her know that we have no desire to fight.\u300dSrng- Pias\u2019s lance vanished.He had changed to non-combat mode.Ain looked at him strangely.Pias opened his mouth before she made the first move.\"Wait, I'm not here to fight. We've been looking for you.\"\"Looking for me?\"Ain looked at Pias with suspicious eyes.She thought that no one would be looking for her except for Hyun, but there was a weird guy in front of him who suddenly appeared and said that, so she became a little bit interested.\"Hmm... What level are you?\"\u300cPias, you can't ask things like that! That's of bad manners. Say sorry to her!\u300dXL became angry because of what Pias had just said.All the other members who were watching his stream grabbed their respective heads.But soon, the atmosphere changed after hearing Ain's answer.\"Level 67.\"\"Huh...?\"\u300cHmm...?\u300dEveryone was frozen by what Ain had just said regarding her level. Reina was the first one to come back to her senses.\u300cDon't be fooled. She's clearly lying! Hey Pias, try to fight her. Let's see if she's really level 67.\u300d\u300cReina, be quiet!\u300dXL intervened quickly.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *He felt the need to have the possibility of muting even the vice leader.\u300cOf course, she wouldn't reveal her real level. After all, she didn't even put her name on the hall of fame. Stick to our plan and try to make her join us.\u300dBut Pias wasn't looking at the guild chat window.He was just asking the questions he had on his mind.That's how shocked he was.Pias and Ain were looking at each other, but somehow, he felt she wasn't telling a lie.\"Are you really level 67? I'm having a hard time believing it.\"\"Why?\"\"You were the one who fought against us at that mountain, right? Did you get stronger thanks to a special quest?\"\"I'm not sure what you're talking about.\"\"Then it doesn't make even more sense. How can you be level 67 when you're so strong?\"\"It's true.\"\"It's impossible!\" Pias shouted.After thinking about something, Ain asked a question.\"What level are you?\"\"I'm 98.\"\"Hmm... Quite high.\"\u300cPias, I've told you that you should try to make her join us! Why are you talking about so much nonsense?\u300dDid XL's shout reach the heavens?Ain talked about their main topic first.\"I guess you're asking me this... Because you want to invite me to your guild. Right?\"\"Uh, yeah. That's true, but...\"As the counterpart talked first about what he wanted, Pias couldn't think of what to say next.Then Ain said something more.\"I don't want to.\"\"You don't want to?\"Pias was proud of being part of Darkness.They hadn't lost the number one position since the game opened its doors; they were by far the strongest guild.He never thought she'd refuse so easily.\u2018Is it possible that she doesn't know about 'Darkness'?\u2019Pias tried to explain again.\"If it's you, you can give you all our support! Five pieces of equipment and three accessories. Eight items in total, all up to unique!\"\u300cYes, well done, Pias. First tell her what we can do for her. Maybe then we'll be able to change her opinion.\u300dSuddenly, Ain interrupted Pias.\"Even so, you're all weak.\"\"What...?\"\"Even if you call yourselves the strongest guild, I'm not really interested in joining in. And it's probably a place full of rabble.\"\"...!\"Pias's eyes sank deeply at Ain's harsh words.Maybe she hadn\u2019t had any bad intentions, but Pias felt as if something inside him had been cut off.\"I'm going to cancel my previous words.\"Clang- As Pias changed to combat mode, a giant spear appeared around his hand.\"You probably won thanks to a quest bonus. Or did you think you'd stay in that place forever?\"\"Probably.\"Pias came out strongly, but Ain just replied with a snort.She found it funny.As long as Hyun was with her, there's no way they would lose.While fighting alongside him, she had never lost.\"I'm currently level 67. On top of that, I also have a penalty. You're level 98, so why don't you try to defeat me?\"\"I was planning to do that even if you didn't say it.\"\"Hng, then things would get funny if I win. Right?\"\u300cThis... isn't good.\u300dXL smiled bitterly while watching the stream.He understood how Pias was feeling.They couldn't stay still after she made fun of Darkness.Pias, just like him, was one of the founding members of Darkness, so they'd been together since the beginning.He understood his feelings, so he couldn't criticize him for his actions.Although he wished he could control them a little bit better.\u300cYes, that's preferable. That vixen... I don't like how she underestimates us. Pias, just destroy her!\u300dReina came to support Pias.\u300cShe probably thinks she's some sort of king because she got lucky at the beginning. Later on, the difference between the users will narrow down! Ain? Good, I'll remember that name!\u300d\u300cWhat's going to happen...\u300dXL let out an anxious moan.From a standard point of view, what Pias and Reina said was true.There was always the possibility that they had received help from the quest.Even if there was a big difference at the moment, as time went on and the growth rate slowed down, the specs of the top-rated players would eventually get similar.But then\u2026 why was it?He was feeling uneasy.Was he worrying too much?'If things were going to get like this... It probably should've been better not to have met her.'That thought crossed XL's mind.With a scary atmosphere, Pias and Ain's battle continued. And after a struggle, Pias ended up losing.From an outsider's perspective, it could've looked like a defeat by a narrow margin.But everyone knew that the opponent had a 50% debuff on all her stats.Even without help from the quest, she was on top of Pias.It was the moment when she proved that she was a top-tier ranker.After returning to the lobby, Pias couldn't overcome his anger and hit the floor hard.He could feel his eyes tearing up.* * *In SeoHyun's room.He spent most of his time sleeping while waiting for the penalty to end.'Is the server maintenance about to end?'Luckily for him, his penalty ended at the same time the main story patch was over.The patch would take two hours to be implemented.Either way, SeoHyun wasn't going to be able to log in, so he felt that the penalty was cut down by two hours.'I'm going to be able to log in as soon as the patch finishes!'He spent the rest of the time on the computer.The atmosphere of the users ahead of a large-scale patch was like the eve of a storm.On the community boards, you could see some ex Asra players explaining the content that was about to be added.Because there wasn't any information on the official page, those types of threads became trending almost instantly.Among the new things added, the biggest difference was related to the 'forces.'Most people were also asking questions related to that.\u300cWhat force should I choose?\u300d\u300cCan we change forces later on?\u300d\u300cAm I going to be left behind if I don't choose a force? I'd like to play as neutral, just like I've been doing up until now...\u300dThe story began five years in the future when the world had been split into two forces.\u2014The heavens and abyss.If you picked either one of those, it was hard to change it later on. So just like the job hunting process, users had to be serious about it.'Should I log on?'After looking at the time, he laid down on the capsule.He had already thought about it, so he didn't have doubts, unlike the rest.[Starting Asrian.]Instead of going directly to the play screen, a word saying \u201cloading\u201d could be seen.Once the update finished, the logo of NFM appeared and then disappeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 - The Heavens and the Abyss (1)The main story's opening video began.There was a vast space in front of Hyun that was impossible to see in its entirety at first glance.In the middle of the space, he could see the planet Asra going around the sun.Hyun felt as if he were looking at a 3D movie. He looked around.'Woah, the quality is great!'Looking at the universe from such a distance made him feel as if he were a god.Because he was in space, it took him a while to get used to the flow of time.It didn't take even a minute for Asra to go around the sun.Also, just like a top, it rotated many times per second.The camera's position was fixed behind Asra, so he felt as if he was racing along with it through the outskirts of the sun.Hyun was enjoying the video when some letters appeared in front of him.<In the beginning, there were two entities.><Heaven and the Abyss.><They were entities that couldn't exist either together or alone.>Flap-!Suddenly, the camera closed upon the planet.The planet's surface was red.It was hellish scenery\u2014flames and magma covered everything.That was probably how the planet looked when it was born.<Heaven and Abyss fought for control of the territory.><After a long discussion, they reached an agreement.><The outer was of the Heavens, and the inside was of the Abyss.>The flames on the surface died instantly.Soon, the magma solidified.Instead of that, a blue sea began to rise.Trees and grass grew, withered, and grew again.Many years passed in just a few seconds.<The heavens took control of 'Cold' and 'Electricity.' That's why the sky is cold, and sometimes you can see lightning.><The Abyss obtained 'Heat' and 'Wind.' So the inner core was always full of heat. When the earth rotated, the wind rose.>Time began accelerating again.Parts of nature started to be destroyed. In its place, he could see artificial things rising.The history of humanity had begun.<One day, an existence called \u2018human\u2019 was born.><It captured the attention of the heavens and the abyss because they had a consciousness that transcended their instincts.><But humans only looked at the heavens; there were almost none that looked at the abyss.><The territory of the humans was the surface; that's why they were in the territory of the heavens by a little margin!>Flap-! As the screen changed again, ominous beings began appearing one by one.Transcendents.And among those, the beings called demons.Most of them had either horns or a tail.Among those, there were some Hyun knew about.Those beings that were surrounded by a black energy rose from the ground and soared to the heavens.<The Abyss was angry that it couldn't get the attention of the humans, so it decided to invade the Heavens.><Transcendents who had the will of the Abyss began appearing on Heaven's territory!>Once again, the scenery changed.Now they were somewhere deep in the ground.Even though it was deep underground, it showed a neat grandeur.It was a place that resembled a dungeon.'Wait, it's the dungeon!'Hyun realized.\u2014A huge column that connected the Abyss with the surface world.The moment he saw the endless spiral stairs, something flashed in his mind.'It's the place I escaped from with Louise!'Tap- Tap-The sounds of the steps going up the stairs echoed through the entire place.Hyun turned his head around to where the sound could be heard.Two people were going up through the stairs.Because their bodies were overflowing with black energy, their faces couldn't be seen.Even so, Hyun knew about their identities.One was tall, and the other one short.The tall one scattered away and entered the short one.That was probably his skill 'Assimilation.''Is that... Really me and Louise?'Even Hyun, who knew Asrian's story, was confused about this.He couldn't understand why he was in the opening video.He also couldn't understand why he and Louise looked like demons.In the video, they didn't look like humans made of flesh and bones\u2014they looked like an entity formed by black energy.Then what happened next was just as Hyun remembered.Gwoo-.Soon, the spiral staircase crumbled as if it were made of sand.The two beings of the Abyss, who Hyun thought were him and Louise, began climbing the walls toward the surface.From time to time, the two devils became one.\u2014A demon was copying the traces of the movements he had done a few days prior.He still remembered a few of them.Everything on that video matched what had happened that day.The masked enemies were portrayed as divine beings of light.<The Heavens tried to stop the greed of the Abyss.>The demon, who he thought was Louise, hesitated at the dungeon's entrance before going outside.Because the expression was hidden, only Hyun knew that she was hesitating.<But the Abyss succeeded in sending its existence to the surface.><Furthermore, it tried to paint the territory of the Heavens with its color.><The peace broke, and the forces of the surface split into two factions.>And then the video ended, and Hyun appeared on the main plaza of Leton Village.As soon as he logged in, he was flooded with messages.Ting-![You've cleared the quest 'Protect Louise'!][There are no rewards!][You've stopped the main event, 'Great Reincarnation'!][Your stats have increased by +10!][You've stopped the main event, 'Protect the Heavens.'!][Your stats have increased by +10!][You've activated the hidden event, 'Evil Gathering'!][Your skill points have increased by +20!][You have strongly interfered with the cause and effect of the world.][You've indirectly experienced changing history!][Level Up!] x 25...[Five years have passed since that day. The world has divided into two forces. The 'Heavens' and the 'Abyss.' From now on, you can pick sides!][You can decide your side by going to a church that belongs to either the 'Heavens' or the 'Abyss' and getting a Rune.][Each side will support you in different ways and also give you a 'special buff'!]* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Hyun came to his senses after a while.He couldn't understand the situation very well, so he opened the status window.He had gone up 25 levels and also received achievement bonus stats and skill points.'What happened?'Hyun couldn't hide his smile.But he also felt relentless. He felt that he wouldn't feel calm until he understood what had happened.\"Oh, that's right!\"Hyun remembered something.His promise with Louise.Shortly before parting ways, Louise had said that they should meet in the dungeon's secret marketplace.'I guess I'll know what happened once I meet her.'Because he had respawned in a town near the place where he died, it didn't take him a lot of time to reach the dungeon.Hyun tried to suppress his excitement and began running.He went through a road that resembled a maze and then jumped up the cliff.He could definitely feel that his Agility had increased a lot.After reaching the secret marketplace, he opened its door.Creak-.He pulled the doorknob and looked inside, but there was no one there.For a moment, Hyun felt his heart sink.'She isn't here? Did something wrong happen?'While he thought that, he saw something on top of the table.A black robe.It was the Cloak of the Blood Fairy he had given to Louise to make her run faster.On top of the robe, there was also the Ring of the Executioner.Next to it, there was a small bag with some gold coins.And finally, there was a letter.Hyun read that first.\u300cI hope you understand that my writing isn't good.-It's been a little bit over a year since that day.-I don't think that I'll be able to keep the promise to meet you again in five years.-I'm about to leave somewhere far away, so I thought I'd at least leave a letter.\u300dA relieved smile appeared around Hyun's mouth.It was because he knew that at least something unexpected hadn't happened.\u300cI'm not very good at writing, so I won't overextend it.-I've left all the items you lent me on the table.-If this place is as hard to find as you've said, no one will probably come here. I have no one else to hide them, so I'm going to leave them here.-I've also left the 20 gold coins you lent me.-I hope no one else takes them.\u300dHe rememberedHe had sold her the bread you received as a beginner.He had completely forgotten about that.\u300cCould I talk a little bit about myself now...?-I don't understand why, but people from the world view me as a demon.-Because the Holy Kingdom has placed a reward on me, I even have a hard time moving at night.-The thing I said about soon leaving to somewhere far away is related to that.\u300dThe bottom of the paper was slightly more wrinkled than the rest.It was as if a single tear had dropped and dried down.\u300cHyun, I want to see you again. I really want to see you.-One day, I began to think about my life.-I don't really remember my childhood, so the only time I had fun was the short time I spent with you.-It was so fun that I almost forgot that we were being chased.-Don't you want to see me? I want to meet you once more.\u300dThe letter ended there.No, now that he looked closely, some small letters were behind it.\u300cIf you have some time, can you come and find me?-I won't be able to tell you where I'm going.-Since I also don't know where I'm traveling to.\u300dTing-.The moment Hyun finished reading the letter, he got a quest message.[ <Main Quest: In Search of Louise!> ]- Go and find her. But you won't be able to get a clue about her location or know whether she's alive or dead.- Still, will you accept the quest? (Y/N)* Attention: If you find out that Louise is dead, you'll have failed the quest!Hyun frowned.It was as if the quest was trying to make him give up.He knew this was reckless.Searching for a person in this vast world was like looking for dust in the sand.But even if it wasn\u2019t right then, he should be able to meet her one day. Right?As long as she was alive.[You've accepted the quest.][Because you've made such a big impact, you cannot remain neutral! You lean toward the Abyss! (Currently: -73)][You've been automatically placed on 'Abyss.']Fwoosh- Suddenly, a rune that looked like fire appeared on Hyun's hand.Even if a fire was burning on his hand, he didn't feel hot.That meant he was part of the forces of the Abyss.Things like that tended to happen if your actions leaned too much toward one side.'So Louise is part of the forces of the Abyss?'Hyun smiled bitterly.It was his first time being part of the Abyss.That made it difficult to approach areas such as the Sky Castle or the Holy Land.Abyss, underground\u2026 It was where demons roamed.That meant he wouldn't be able to walk freely in front of high-ranking heaven officials.'Well, I'm sure I'll be able to change sides in the future.'Depending on a quest or your actions, you could change sides.For the average user, it would be almost impossible. But to him, who had nearly every bit of information and strength, it wasn't out of reach.'Did Louise say that she got mistaken by a demon...? If I can solve the misunderstanding through the quest, I'm sure I'll be able to change the trait.'He still wasn't sure about Louise's true identity, but since she had appeared in the opening video, she was clearly someone important to the story.Getting to influence her should be the easiest way to change sides.But since he was temporarily locked on the Abyss force, Hyun thought he should try to think about everything he could do.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 - The Heavens and the Abyss (2)As the main story of Asrian began, Korean communities exploded.But among all the people, non realized that the entity covered by black energy was a user.Even Ain didn't realize that it was Hyun.Everyone just looked at the video as if it were a movie scene.Even users that normally skipped the story were focused on it. That's how immersive the video was.- Woah... It's the first time I've forgotten how to breathe while watching a video.- It was cooler than most action movies. Especially that last scene of fighting while climbing up the walls.- Can you really make motions like that with just the game engine?-\u00a0 It really is a fight between angels and demons.A few of them tried to guess about future events.The developers had said that, on the video, there was a huge clue in regards to the history of Asrian. That's why many users tried to analyze it.- In the last scene, you can see a demon escaping to the surface world. She's probably going to make the world fall into a conflict.- Then the next story is about fighting against demons? I'm going to side with the Heavens after all.- If you choose to side with the Abyss, maybe you'll be on the same team with that demon.\u300d- But how do we participate in the story? Also, what force is it better to join?After the patch, the prologue video and picking sides made the communities explode.The one that made order of the chaos was, once again, the ex Asra player, Steel Rock.<The force structure I found out through the opening video\u2026>\u300cI'm Steel Rock, a former Asra Online player. I was once ranked 20. I'm currently placed 819 on the Hall of Fame.\u201cI'm going to make a brief explanation since everyone seems confused.\u201d\u201cFirst, unlike most other RPG games, Asra Online's story isn't fixed!\u201d\u201cWhat am I talking about?\u201d\u201cThe Heavens and the Abyss constantly fight against each other, and depending on the results of certain fights or events, a new future can be born.\u201d\u201cTo put it simply, Asrian's history will change depending on the faction the user belongs to!\u201d\u201cYou just have to join the side you want to help, but I don't recommend staying neutral.\u201d\u201cThe buff each force gives you is quite useful, so joining either side ASAP will help you in regards to gameplay.\u201d\u201cI've put the buff each side gives below, so consider these before deciding. ^^\u201d[ <Heaven's Force Buff> ]- Increase resistance to cold and thunder by 10%.- Increase experience received by hunting or quests by 15%.- You can receive help from NPCs that belong to Heaven's faction. (*Take into consideration: Most human countries belong to Heaven's Force!)<Abyss's Force Buff>- Increase resistance to fire and wind by 10%.- Increase rewards obtained by achievements by 30%.- You can hide the faction you belong to by changing the rune. (*Take into consideration: You won't be able to fool some high-ranking priests or some named NPCs!)Steel Rock's guide was of great help to people that had just begun playing Asrian.That was because he had explained the concept of both forces in easy terms.In the community boards, there were already exclusive boards for \"Heaven\" and \"Abyss.\"Among the users who hadn't picked a side, many kept asking an endless number of questions.- Among the Abyss Force's bonus, what's the 'Achievement Reward'?- I'm also not sure. While playing, I've never received an achievement bonus.- Oh, I have! I received it once I killed a Slime on a field. I got a notification that said that I had obtained an achievement and got an extra one strength!- Hmm... 30% of 1 strength. Does that mean your strength goes up by 1.3%? Is it just rounding up?- It's trash...Most users picked to side with the Heavens.An extra 15% of experience obtained was something that most users lusted after.15% may sound like a little, but as time went on, the effect would become greater.Every six days of play, you basically would've gained an extra one compared to others!Most users seemed to agree.Except for people with certain jobs like Assassin, they would benefit more from choosing to side with the Heavens.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Stardust Team.Every player and the coaches were gathered to discuss what force to choose to side with.Thanks to hiring someone who had played Asra Online for three years, they were able to discuss things in depth.\"There doesn't seem to be any reason to wonder about it any longer.\"According to what they'd talked about, there was only one benefit from being part of the Abyss: That you could hide the force you belonged to by hiding the rune.You could benefit from that if you were a solo player, but it wasn't useful to someone that belonged to a professional gaming team.On the other hand, siding with the Heavens gave you clear benefits, so there was no reason not to select it.\"Then\u2026 all the members of Stardust are going to side with the Heavens.\"The decision was made without any objection.Everyone nodded at the director\u2019s words.* * *Hwarang Guild.Until a few weeks prior, it was South Korea's number one guild.A lot of professional teams had begun playing Asrian recently, so you couldn't say that they were the number one by an overwhelming difference anymore\u2014but they still maintained the number one position.Immediately after the main story patch, there was a notification for all the members of the Hwarang Guild.<The Guild's Leader 'ShinGoong' notifies the members. The Hwarang Guild is siding with the Heavens. Everyone, you have a week to pick it.>* * *Darkness Guild.The Guild's leader, XL, vice-leader Reina, and members in the top 20 rankings\u2026 five people in total were gathered.They were discussing what side to pick.\"You either choose the Heavens or the Abyss...\" Mayday said while thinking very deeply.A few days before, she had reached level 100, completed the job ascension quest, and obtained the job 'Psychokinesis Sorcerer.'With a Rank of second, she was the member with the highest level in the Guild, so everyone took her words seriously.\"From the point of view of the Guild, siding with the Heavens would clearly be better...\"Mayday murmured with regret.\"But I'm personally more attracted to the Abyss.\"\"Why is that, Mayday?\"XL asked, and she answered.\"Fufu... That's clearly because of the achievement bonus! You may not know this, but I'm an achievement killer! Achievement killer!\"Mayday shared with them part of her status window with the rest.The status window was normally considered private information, but everyone there were people that had been together with her since Darkness was created\u2014they were people she could trust.Everyone's mouths were wide-opened after looking at her status window.\"What, why do you have so much Magical Power?! It doesn't look like you ignored other stats...!\"\"She even has a lot of Strength, which should be a useless stat for a Magician.\"\"This is all thanks to achievement bonuses.\"Mayday's explanation was like so.Her level was 102, but her stats were closer to those of a player at level 130.That was all thanks to her obtaining many achievements while playing.If you added the bonus that the 'Abyss' gave, her stats would be on par with a level 140 player.\"Huff...! I've never cared about achievements!\" Said Pias, who was 20 on the rankings, agonizing.The other reacted in similar ways.\"I didn't even know that there were things like that. I've never received one, after all,\" Reina mumbled while shrugging.\"How the second Ranker plays is definitely different from others.\"\"Yes, as leveling up becomes progressively harder, eventually the influence that the achievement bonus gives you will be bigger.\"\"This means that there's a chance that most top rankers will choose to side with the Abyss!\"XL listened to what Mayday said carefully.Maybe his ability to analyze things was better, but he knew that he lacked in gaming sense compared to the top rankers.That's why he had felt the need to listen and learn from other rankers.XL quickly organized his thoughts.\"Good, I've decided. Most of our Guild will choose the Heavens, but a few will belong to the Abyss. Mayday, please lead those who choose the Abyss.\"\"Eh? Are you sure about this?!\"\"Of course.\"XL had concluded after thinking enough.\"There aren't many people on our Guild that can benefit from being part of the 'Abyss.' Maybe a few people with jobs related to a Thief, especially those related to Assassin.\"\"Yeah, I agree.\"Reina agreed.Among the effects of the Abyss, there was one that allowed you to hide which force you belonged to. It was a buff that Assassins should welcome.Even if it weren't for the achievement bonus, most would probably choose to side with the Abyss.\"It's harder to retain the number one position rather than getting it. To remain at the top, we need information from both sides. Also\u2026\"XL's eyes shone sharply.\"We still don't know which side those two with the greatest influence belong to.\"\"Two? Ah!\"\"Yes, I'm talking about Lattice and Ain!\"The moment those names came out of XL's mouth, everyone became tense.In Pias\u2019s eyes, who had a quarrel with Ain a few days before, a cold fire seemed to be burning.\"It doesn't matter if they're enemies or allies. It will be easier to deal with them if we have them close to us. We need to look for both sides.\"It was just as XL said.There's a saying that, rather than an opponent in front of you, an ally that attacks you from behind is scarier.And if it was an enemy that attacked you from behind, it was even scarier.\"Which side do you think they're going to choose?\" Bear Shield asked.Mayday thought about it silently for a while.\"I personally wish they choose to side with the Heavens... If they pick Abyss, I think they will become hard to deal with.\"\"Is it because of the Achievement bonus?\"Mayday nodded.XL and Reina also became nervous.They were thinking the same thing as her.Even Mayday, ranked number two, had extra stats that accounted for over 30 levels.How many achievements did Lattice have, the number one in the rankings?Just thinking about that gave them goosebumps.* * *\"Isn't it obvious?\"Somewhere.At someone's question\u2026The main spoke with an arrogant smile on his face.'Abyss, of course.'Fwoosh- A fire rune appeared on his hand.* * *The discussion about what side it was better to choose continued for many days.According to a survey done in a community, the ratio between Heaven and Abyss was eight to two.Only 20% of the players had chosen the Abyss.There were many reasons why they'd given up on the many bonuses the Heavens gave.- I can't give up on the Necromancer job, so I decided to side with the Abyss. If you pick the Heavens, you can't transfer jobs to one related to black magic.- Me too. I'm thinking of converting to Dark Priest!.- I'm going to become an Assassin.- I picked Abyss after seeing that it gave a 30% extra achievement bonus. In the latter part of the game, achievement bonuses will become more important than experience, so I'm not sure why everyone's so desperate for the 15% extra experience.- Am I the only one that chose the Abyss because it's cooler?There were many reasons why some users had picked the Abyss, but most agreed that it was better to side with the Heavens.- People belonging to the Heavens will reach a higher level faster than the Abyss. Is it that they don't know how big the 15% extra experience is??- People belonging to the Abyss can't receive help from NPCs easily. In the Heavens, you're going to receive full support from them, so everyone that has chosen the other side is stupid.- The people that belong to the Abyss will roam around while hiding like rats. Why are they even playing them? It seems like they want to change the game genre from RPG to a survival one, lol. Most countries are going to side with the Heavens.The tone of the users that had chosen the Heavens was rough, but they weren't completely wrong.Because there wasn't almost any country that sided with the Abyss, users who had picked this side had to watch over their shoulders constantly.The advantage that the Heavens had became clearer a few days after the patch was over.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - Heaven Invasion (1)\"I, Emperor Carlos announce that, until the Abyss that has taken root in Asra disappears completely, I will give my full support to all users that belong to the Heaven's Force!\"\"The Holy Kingdom will also help users that belong to Heaven's Force! We cannot stay still and watch the actions of those evil people!\"The two most important countries had announced that they'd fully support users that belonged to the Heavens.As they came out with how they would support users, all the surrounding small countries started to join too.That's how most human forces, except for a few, joined in one big alliance.The 'Knights Road,' which was in the Empire's capital, was a place that was forbidden to users before the patch, but after the Emperor's support, it became accessible to users that belonged to the Heaven's Forces.\"Support users that belong to the Heaven's Forces!\"After Emperor Carlos's announcements, users were allowed to use the Empire's training facilities.For a user, that was of great help.You could learn many skills like \u00abImperial Basic Sword Art\u00bb from the NPCs!Not only sword the art, but you could also learn archery, magic, and holy magic, among other things, so it was something that every user of the Heaven's Forces welcomed.But that required a lot of NPCs.Even if there were a lot of inhabitants of Asra, the workforce of the Empire was limited; that's why they couldn't fully support novice users under level 50.They also received a simple 'Heaven's Quest,' so there weren't many complaints, but it was true that they'd received less support compared with top users.The top-tier rankers that were part of the Heaven's Forces received more benefits and support than those offered by top Guilds, so everyone was trying their best to reach a higher place in the rankings.* * *Mina-san\u2026 Noris\u2026They were both Japanese users and sisters in real life.Mina-san was a Magician.Noris was a Warrior.They had reached level 50 just before the patch. And thanks to that, they'd gotten the benefit of being able to walk on the Knights Road.It wasn't like they'd received special treatment, but just being able to walk on that road was a huge opportunity.They had received a quest that allowed them to learn a free skill![Heaven's Quest: Let's learn the Imperial Basic Sword Art!]- Hit the scarecrow and increase your swordsmanship proficiency (Currently 49%)- If you fill the proficiency bar, you can learn the \u00abImperial Basic Sword Art\u00bb Lv.0.Noris had received a skill quest related to sword art and Mina-san to magic.Mina-san always felt a little bit sad because of the low amount of magic she could use.You didn't need to use skill points on skills obtained by quests, which made Mina-san even happier.\"Finally, 50%! Oof... I never thought that I'd train so hard...\"Users inside the game wouldn't run out of breath, even if they moved roughly, but spending an entire day hitting a scarecrow was tiring labor by itself.\"Eh? 50% already? Fast!\"Mina-san, who had just filled 30%, was surprised.She had also spent hours hitting the scarecrow with magic.Unlike Noris, Mina-san was a Magician.Every time she ran out of mana, she had to rest, so the progress was slower.\"Sister, you're amazing!\"\"It's going up 20% by an hour... But I just wish boring things like this ended more quickly.\"Noris said while looking at the side of the training center.There, she saw a user receiving personalized training from an imperial soldier.Tsk- Noris felt envious at the sight.\"I also want to receive personalized tutoring!\"The truth was that having someone to teach you was better and faster than learning on your own.Users who received personalized tutoring from an imperial soldier could fill the proficiency bar 10 times faster.\"This is too boring. I don't want to spend the entire day hitting a scarecrow.\"\"But sister... There's nothing we can do about it. That user is probably in Diamond at least on the Battle Arena.\"There were two ways by which NPCs categorized the potential of users:The first one was the ranking in the Hall of Fame, and the second one was the ranking in the Duel Arena!But unless you were among the top 1000 in the Hall of Fame, NPCs wouldn't notice you.That meant that most of the judgment was done based on the duel ranking.Since NPCs couldn't check a user's stats, checking out the duel ranking was probably the most convenient way to judge a user's potential.Because of that, there was a boom in dueling among users that were part of the Heavens Forces.\"I want to reach Diamond...\"\"Me too... But it's impossible with our level...\"\"I know that.\"Noris had spent many hours in the Duel Arena\u2026And had learned the harsh reality.After doing more than 200 matches, she had barely managed to get up to Platinum 5.\"From what I've heard, you're among the top 1% of players if you reach Diamond.\"\"That's amazing. Those people are probably professional gamers or people related to that field, right?\"\"I'm not sure about it, but even Platinum, which I barely managed to get into, was full of monsters. Oh, people in Platinum are among the top 5%.\"\"They're people from another world. We need to learn to conform with our current position.\"From the Empire's point of view, checking out the duel ranking was the best way to know which user to support.There were more benefits to users that had a higher ranking than Diamond.Users with the rank of Master, who were among the top 0.05%, received training from a knight that was in the category of leader.The hours you needed to train were longer, but the skill was stronger than what those of lower tiers could learn.But what if it was a user that was a Grand Master?The top 1000 players\u2026From there, the treatment NPCs gave you changed completely.Grand Master users were treated almost like nobles, so low-ranking officers bowed to them.Asrian's NPCs were scarily similar to real humans.Just like a user tried to get the attention of an NPC, they also tried to get the attention of a user they liked.For example, if the person was a Grand Master\u2026!The growth rate of users was faster than NPCs.NPCs knew that even if there was a user weaker than them, they could become very famous and influential in the future.What if a very affectionate user towards you becomes someone very successful in the future?It wasn't a coincidence that many male users and female NPCs and female users and male NPCs had close relationships.But to enjoy all those benefits, there was a requisite.That requisite was to belong to the Heaven's Force!Even if you ranked high in the duel ranking or were among the top users in the Hall of Fame, if you were part of the Abyss, you couldn't receive support from the Heaven's Forces.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The problem wasn't just not receiving support, but there was also a chance of you being attacked or murdered at the hands of an NPC.At the entrance of the Knight Road, there was a gatekeeper and a high-ranking priest.The priest checked for the Rune.The Heaven's Rune was blue lightning.And the Rune of the Abyss was a red fire.A high-ranking priest could see just by taking a glimpse whether the Rune was real or not.There had been cases of users that belonged to the Abyss who had been killed after trying to fool the priest.\"I'm glad we're part of the Heaven's Force,\" Mina-san murmered.\"People who belong to the Abyss cannot obtain all these benefits even if they rank high. Right?\"\"That's what I've heard.\"\"That's too bad...\"\"The highest-ranking NPC on the Abyss is a demon. Right? I don't think that a demon would willingly help out a human.\"\"It's weird to call it an NPC... Shouldn't we call demons monsters...?\"Noris and Mina-san were talking when the training grounds suddenly became noisy.Both sisters looked at the side from where the noise was coming.\"Hmm? Did something happen?\"Tens of users who were training stopped practicing and walked toward the entrance.Not only users, but NPCs were also looking in that direction.A few soldiers bowed their heads to show respect.One user walked through the crowd.The dark robe, which looked as if it had been covered with black paint, had become quite famous among the users.Noris shouted while looking at the girl.\"Oh, I know who she is!\"\"Since even you recognize her, I guess she's someone very famous.\"\"Yes, she is! Did I see her on the internet...?\"Even though Noris was Japanese, she often watched foreign streams or videos of rankers from other countries.The video of that girl dueling had become a trending topic on a foreign community board. That video had left an intense mark on Noris's memories.\"That's amazing... Do you remember her ID?\"\"Hmm... What was it... It started with A. Ain...? Yeah, I think that was her ID!\"* * *A few hours before.Hyun was sending Ain a message.In Asra Online, both Hyun and Ain belonged to the Heaven's Forces, so if he didn't tell her anything, she would probably choose that side.If he didn't want them to end on different sides, he needed to hurry and tell her.'Wait...!'Hyun got an idea just before sending her a message.'Do we need to be on the same team? Maybe, could we use that strategy...?!'Hyun tried to order his ideas.Ain was taking a rest from dueling when Hyun sent her a whisper.Ain: Oh, you came?Ain's voice seemed more subdued than usual.The reason why she was in a bad mood was that she had lost. And because of that, she wasn't able to earn as many coins as she wanted.Even Ain couldn't overcome the consecutive victory penalty.LeeSeoHyun: Are you hurt? Your voice sounds weak.Ain: I... Lost my consecutive win rate...LeeSeoHyun: Really? Well, I guess even you lose from time to time. So how many consecutive victories had you achieved?Hyun didn't know that Ain was saving up coins to buy the couple\u2019s ring, so he just didn't give it importance, but what Ain said next surprised him.Ain: 60 victories... Ah, did I think too much? I should have just attacked with everything I had!LeeSeoHyun: What? What did you do?! 60 consecutive victories? Oh, wait...!While talking, Hyun remembered his previous line of thought.If Ain's duel ranking was high, couldn't he get away with his plan more easily?!LeeSeoHyun: So, what's your current duel ranking?Ain: Grand Master.LeeSeoHyun: That's great. I was about to ask you to increase your tier.Ain: I know. It's because of the Heaven's Quest requirement, right?LeeSeoHyun: Obviously!AIN: But you need to increase it too.LeeSeoHyun: No, I'm okay.Ain: Hng? Why?LeeSeoHyun: Because I'm Abyss.Ain was surprised at Hyun's answer.Because Hyun hated uncertainty, she was sure he would choose to side with the Heavens.AIN: What happened that you changed sides? I'm glad you told me! If you hadn't said anything, I would've picked Heavens.LeeSeoHyun: You should choose Heavens.Ain: Eh? But\u2026 Hyun, you said that you'd chosen Abyss.LeeSeoHyun: Yes, I'm Abyss. And you, Heaven. Okay?Hyun spoke in short sentences since Ain was having a hard time understanding.\u2018With this, she should've understood. Right?\u2019No, it would be better to explain her things in more detail.Hyun was about to explain to her when Ain quickly asked him a question.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 - Heaven Invasion (2)AIN: W-Wait...! Then what's going to happen with me?LeeSeoHyun: What are you talking about?AIN:\u00a0 Did you get another girl?! It... It's not like she's dragging you, right?!\u2018Another girl? She's not technically wrong.\u2019After all, Louise was the reason why he was part of the Abyss.LeeSeoHyun: Hear me slowly.Hyun explained things slowly to a panicking Ain.This was what he was thinking:If he used \u00abAssimilation\u00bb and entered Ain's body, wouldn't he be able to mix among the Heaven's Forces and freely move?Even a high-ranking priest shouldn't be able to see through \u00abAssimilation\u00bb.Only the Transcendents could see the soul directly.That meant that if he entered Ain's body through \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, even if he was part of the Abyss, he should be able to move mixed among the Heaven's Forces.LeeSeoHyun: Just because we belong to different forces doesn't mean our party will be disbanded. We can do this because we're one.After talking to her for a while, he could finally calm her down.* * *Knight's Road\u2026Users had named that place 'Heaven's Academy.'It was a place where NPCs taught and helped Heaven's users.It was also where NPCs that came from the Empire to teach users stayed.Having the support of an NPC or not made a huge difference.Hyun thought that an NPCs backing was more important than the extra 15% experience.On the Abyss side, you couldn't expect things like that.The reason why he had picked the Heavens in Asra was because he had prioritized the relationship with NPCs.\u300cGood, let's go.\u300dThere was a gatekeeper and a high-ranking priest in front of the Knight's Road entrance.Hyun had used \u00abAssimilation\u00bb and was hidden inside her.The long line shrank, and it was finally Ain's turn.As the gatekeeper blocked the road, the priest next to him talked to her.\"Show me your hand. This is just a formality, so I hope you don't get offended by it.\"After nodding, Ain took out her gloves and extended her hand.Then he shared part of her status window with the gatekeeper.\"Grand Master...\"The gatekeeper's voice trembled.\"Woah, you're only the third Grand Master I\u2019ve seen! But even if you're someone amazing, here in the Knight's Road, you have to show proof that you're part of the Heaven's Forces\u2014not even the Emperor is an exception.\"After saying that, he checked out Ain's hand.At that moment, his eyes got wider, and he stared at it closely.\"This...?!\"The moment the high-ranking priest looked at Ain's Heaven's Rune, his face became pale.The gatekeeper next to him took out his sword after looking at the priest's reaction.He probably thought that the high-ranking priest had discovered someone belonging to the Abyss who had their identity hidden.\"Put the sword down!\"After the priest shouted at him, the gatekeeper put his sword down.As the entrance became noisier, everyone's attention turned toward it.The high-ranking priest took Ain's hand to take a closer look at the Rune.How he was checking out a girl's hand so closely looked strange from the outside, but he didn't seem to care.Ain was just frowning at the feeling of him touching her hands.\"Heavens, this is a perfect Heaven's Rune!\"After a while, the high-ranking pries opened his mouth again.\"It's the rune of a heavenly being!\"Why the high-ranking priest was surprised was understandable.Normally, Heaven's Runes engraved on a user's hands looked like a blue-colored lightning tattoo.But on the Rune engraved on Ain\u2019s hands, not only could you see the lightning and cold air, but the entire Rune was shining on its own.It was the symbol of a Heavenly Being.The reason why Ain had received the Rune of a Heavenly Being was simple.\u2014After clearing the Suspicious Old Man's request, she had obtained the title of Heavenly Being.'How...?'The high-ranking priest seemed confused.A Heavenly Being was someone that lived in a different reality from humans.They lived in the Heavens, in the sky. But sometimes, they descended to earth.They weren't in the category of an Angel, who were Transcendents, but they were beings above humans.Obviously, a user couldn't become a Heavenly Being.But in front of him, there was a girl who had the Rune of a Heavenly Being.The high-ranking priest was deeply immersed in thoughts at the sight of a girl who broke his common sense.\u300cYou remember what I've told you, right? Don't make any mistakes.\u300dSaid Hyun, who was currently \u00abAssimilating\u00bb to Ain.Before going there, he had already prepared an answer for her.Ain wasn't confident in her acting skills... But she decided to follow Hyun's script.\"I think I know why.\"\"Hmm...? What are you talking about?\"\"Why my rune is different.\"The high-ranking priest focused his attention on Ain's words.Ain started to tell the story Hyun had made for her.\"One day, I was being chased by a demon... It was so strong that it wasn't something that I could face. I was sure I was going to die when, suddenly, someone appeared. With just one spell, that being killed lots of demons.\"Ain tried to describe the Heavenly Being's attack by remembering a scene from Asra.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\"It looked like a tornado made of ice. I don't remember it very well, but it was an incredible Magic. Right where the demons disappeared, thousands of ice pieces were scattered away.\"\"Just as expected from a Heavenly Being. I think I know who it was just from the description of the Magic.\"The high-ranking priest shook his head while listening to Ain's words.\"So what happened next?\"Ain looked at the sky and acted as if she was trying to remember.\"Hmm... He said something like he saw potential in me... He tried to take me somewhere, but I refused. I was quite busy at that time.\"\"Oh my...\"The gatekeeper, who was listening to Ain's story with great interest, grabbed his head while frowning.His face was full of regret as if the girl's mistake of letting the opportunity of visiting Heaven go had been his.Ain kept talking a little bit more.\"After that, he said he'd come back to get me and asked me if I was willing to help, so I answered him yes, and then he placed his hands on my head...\"\"Hmm...?\"\"I felt something very cold and tingling entering my body. When I noticed it, he had already disappeared.\"Ain mumbled while looking at the Rune on her hand.\"Did he give me this Rune back then? At that moment, I thought he had attacked me, so I was about to complain.\"\"I see, now I understood.\"They ended up convincing the high priest.The reason why he ended up believing Hyun and Ain's lie was that they'd used information from 'Asra Online.' But he had no way of knowing that.\u300cHow was it?\u300dAin asked Hyun with confidence while the high priest called for someone from inside.How she spoke with confidence as if asking him to praise her gave Hyun a headache.\u300cNo, but can't you talk with another tone?\u300d\u300cWhat?\u300d\u300cJust at first glance, that high priest looks like he's at least 50 years old. You should speak to him more formally.\u300d\u300cWho cares? It's not like he's a real person or anything.\u300dWouldn't talking to them in such a way anger the NPC?In one way, Hyun's concern made sense, but in the another, it didn't.The formal language was present only in a few languages, including Korean.In Asrian Online, where every language was translated instantly, it was something that didn't matter.The only problem was when two Korean users were talking to each other.While Hyun and Ain were chit-talking, the Heaven's NPCs had finished the formalities.A soldier approached Ain.\"I'm Rudas, the one in charge of guiding you! Feel free to ask me any questions you have!\"Because the high priest had sent a special message, Rudas talked to Ain as if she was her superior.On the Heaven's Forces, the influence of being a Heavenly Being was that big.The gatekeeper gave Rudas a remainder just in case.\"A Heavenly Being has chosen this person, so be respectful.\"\"Of course!\"\"Also, this is the high priest Andro's certification. This should be enough.\"When the word \u201cHeavenly Being\u201d came out, Rudas stood up straight.NPCs also understood a user's potential growth rate and influence.If it was a user with this much influence... Maybe she could become someone huge who could change their life, so it was understandable that Rudas was so nervous.Although Rudas was older than Ain, he still showed proper respect toward Ain.\"Your ID is complete! With this, you'll be able to prove your identity!\"Ain received a crystal from the soldier that was the size of her thumb.\"Mrs. User...\"\"Ain.\"\"Yes. Mrs. Ain, should I talk to you about the Knight's Road?\"\"Hmm... Okay.\"Ain nodded.The truth was that neither Hyun nor Ain needed an explanation about the Knight's Road since they had been there previously, so even without an explanation, they could guess about most things.Ain nodded while the soldier excitedly talked alone. Meanwhile, she was talking with Hyun.\u300cYou're amazing... You're really good at tricking people.\u300d\u300cHaha, this much is nothing,\u300dHyun said while laughing confidently.He was relieved they were able to reach that place.The possibility of meeting high-ranking NPCs or priests was quite low, and in the worst case, he could always \u00abAssimilate\u00bb into Ain.No one would think that someone from the Abyss has managed to enter the Knight's Road.Hyun mumbled while looking at the road.\u300cThere are already a lot of users.\u300d\u300cThere are probably lots of NPC, too.\u300d\u300cI guess so. This is, after all, a city of the Empire.\u300dBecause the Knight's Road had a chic atmosphere, it was a place that was often frequented by nobles.Although the game was based in a medieval city, it didn't feel rustic. The reason behind that was that there were a lot of magic circles applied on the streets.Among them, some had effects that couldn't be seen in real life.\u300cWoah, to think we'd be able to ride this again.\u300dThe world of Asrian was crafted with such details that even the same thing couldn't be compared to the one in Asra.Hyun and Ain had taken the 'Cloud Boat' and were moving to the building in front of them, on the other side.The 'Cloud Boat' was a device that looked like an escalator that moved with Magic. It was used to move through the sky from end to end.As the Cloud Boat's altitude became higher, the entirety Knight's Road could be seen.Hyun was overwhelmed by the splendor and grandeur of the city.Because a scenery that didn't seem to exist in real-life unfolded, they couldn't take their eyes off it.Ain also was looking at the scenery with her mouth wide open.\"The Knight's Road is one of the many things we're proud of.\"In the soldier's voice, they could feel the pride of a citizen of the Empire.After a few minutes, the Cloud Boat reached a building so big that it looked as if it would touch the sky.The Cloud Boat stopped on the building's balcony; the soldier's explanation kept going on.\"Fourth floor of the Knight's Hall\u2026 It's the free training center.\"\u300cAmazing...\u300dHyun was honestly surprised.Looking with his own eyes through virtual reality made him realize just how big the Empire was.When looking down from the railing, the height of the building seemed to be at least 100 meters.How it only had four floors just showed how big and spacious it was inside.Because they had the help of Magic, the buildings had surpassed the limits of modern architecture.\"I'm not in charge from this point onwards, so I'm going to retire. If you present your ID anywhere, you shouldn't have any inconvenience!\"After saying that, the soldier took the Cloud Boat and left the place.But they didn't feel the need to get a new attendant.Both Hyun and Ain, thanks to their experience in Asra, knew about most things.\"Good, then let's start,\" Hyun mumbled as they found a place where no one was around and he disassimilated.In the Knight's Hall, there were a lot of facilities that elite knights could use.But because of the Emperor's order, its access had been limited to users that had at least a 'Master' battle ranking.Everyone that qualified lusted over it.From a user's point of view, there were many things they could take advantage of in the Knight's Hall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 - Heaven's Invasion (3)\"What do you want to do first? Achievements? Getting a new skill? Or... Maybe level up?\"If one could use the Knight's Hall, there was no need to hunt until reaching level 100.Training in that place gave you more experience than hunting. So why would anyone hunt?\"Hmm... Should we start by clearing all the achievements?\"Among the bonuses that being part of the Abyss gave, there was one that increased the rewards by 30%.Usually, users that belonged to the Abyss couldn't get access to the Knight's Hall, but Hyun somehow managed to get inside.He could benefit from both the Heaven's achievements and the bonus that being part of the Abyss gave. In other words, profit.\"I think we need to farm some experience for you first, Ain.\"Because they'd played those past few days separately, the gap between Hyun and Ain's level had widened.It was important for a party to have similar levels for safety reasons, so increasing Ain's level was the current priority.Not only that, but to use the Heaven's facilities, Hyun needed Ain's ID, so he couldn't move independently.\"Yeah, let's level up first. It's not like it's going to take a lot of time so.\"Hyun and Ain were about to move to the next place when someone grabbed his attention.\"Oh...?!\"At the sight of someone unexpected, Hyun's eyes widened.At first glance, he thought that he'd made a mistake, but after watching closely, he became sure it was that guy.He never thought he'd be able to meet him in Asrian since the game's world was so big.\"Kim JaeHoon...?\"JaeHoon had also seen Hyun.He was also thinking about the same thing.After Hyun spoke to him first, a joyful expression blossomed on JaeHoon's face.\"Are you... Lee SeoHyun?!\"JaeHoon was wondering if that was the case, and it was, indeed.He was more surprised since the world of Asrian was as big as the real world.Even if there were millions of players, the number of NPCs was far greater than that. So it was obvious that he wasn't expecting to see him.\"It's really you!\"\"Woah, I never thought I'd see you here!\"The reason why they'd been able to meet each other was because of their battle ranking.After the patch was over, every user with a high battle ranking started to gather around that place, so that's why they'd been able to meet each other.Even considering that, there were tens of 'Heaven's Academies,' so the probability of both of them meeting was still low.Because they were inside the game, they decided to call each other by their nicknames.\"Practice? That's a really professional gamer-like name.\"\"Hey, it's even weirder using an abbreviation of your real name as ID.\"At that moment, Ain, who was listening silently next to Hyun, wriggled her eyebrows.It was then that Practice noticed Ain's presence.He was so happy he met Hyun that he didn't notice the surroundings.\"Eek...?!\"When he saw her, his eyes opened even wider than when he met Hyun.There, he could see a girl who he knew very well.As their eyes met, she just greeted him by raising her hand.\"Y-you\u2026?\" Practice asked while stuttering.Ain smiled triumphantly.\"Me? I'm in the same party as Hyun.\"\"SeoHyun, no, you're in the same party as Hyun...?\"\"Why are you so surprised?\"Ain, who found Practice's attitude weird, asked him while tilting her head.Her confusion was understandable. Sadly, she didn't remember Practice's face.She just couldn't memorize the faces of all the people she'd fought against in the Duel Arena.That's why she couldn't understand why Practice was looking at her like that.\"Hmm, what a weird guy.\"\"Hey, how can you talk like that to someone you've never seen...! He isn't an NPC. He's a real person!\"While Hyun was warning her, Practice understood what was going on.She probably didn't remember his face.It was understandable that she hadn't recognized him. After all, he had been standing stupidly with his mouth wide-opened.After recognizing his mistake, Practice spoke up again.\"Don't you remember me? We met in the duel arena!\"Practice tried to imitate the moves he'd used in the Duel Arena.Ain remembered after seeing the attack that changed direction twice.\"Oh, you're that guy!\"\"You do remember me, right?\"\"I remembered.\"\"What? You guys have met each other before?\"Hyun couldn't believe what was going on.By pure coincidence, he had met his friend in Asrian. But somehow, they knew each other.'What a coincidence... No way, maybe it isn't?'When he thought about it, maybe it wasn't that strange.Everyone there was a user with a rank that was at least or higher than Master.Practice was aiming to become a professional gamer, and Ain was someone who loved dueling, so it wasn't weird for both of them to know about each other.\"But who's that person?\"At Hyun's sudden question, everyone's attention became focused on one place.In that place, there was a girl with blue hair who was wearing glasses.That woman had been standing there since the moment Practice approached him.Practice, who realized his mistake, smiled awkwardly.\"Oops, I forgot to introduce Jini.\"Practice immediately introduced his partner.Just like Hyun and Ain always moved together, Practice also had party members with whom he played.And among those, the closest one was the one in front of them, Jini.She began to introduce herself.\"ID Jini, I'm part of Stardust. My position is Priest.\"\"Oh, so you're also a professional gamer.\"Hyun scratched his head.She had blue hair and facial features that resembled those of a westerner.She was clearly a foreigner, so Hyun wondered why she was in a 'Korean' professional gaming team.But the explanation that followed made it clear.Although she had some European blood mixed on her, her nationality was Korean. But since she had just returned to Korea after living most of her life in a foreign country, her Korean wasn't good, so she asked for understanding.'Ain...?'* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Leaving Practice aside, she had become excited after realizing that she was Ain.From the moment she saw Ain, her gaze was fixed on her.Even without Practice's introduction, she was able to recognize her. That was because Ain's face had already been publicly known thanks to various communities.Inside Stardust, it had been a hot topic that Practice had improved a lot after studying Ain's movements.Not only that, but they'd learned a little bit more about her thanks to a coach that had experience playing Asra Online.'I can't believe I get to see her in a place like this.'Jini clenched her fist.She had already seen Ain's fighting video that had trended on Reddit.She also checked out Ain's previous videos in which people thought that she was an NPC.How she moved in a battle as if she were dancing was almost like an art in itself.The first time she saw it, she was shocked by it, and the more she looked at the videos, the more fascinated she became.The coach had said that Ain's experience in PvP and know-how couldn't be compared to an average professional gamer.Jini had also tried to learn from her movements, but she had soon reached her limits.\u2014A harmony made of a mixture of irregular movements.Even for Jini, who had good eye-sight, it was hard to analyze Ain's movements.Jini never thought she'd get the opportunity to see her right when she was struggling.\"You're Ain, right? It's an honor to meet you.\"Ain was a little bit flustered at Jini's reaction.\"Are you talking about... Me?\"\"Yes. You're very famous, didn't you know?\"In just an instant, Jini asked numerous questions.Among them, there were some private ones that didn't have anything to do with the game.\"If you don't mind, how old are you?\"\"Hmm... That...\"Ain looked at Hyun and tried to brush off the question, but she ended up revealing her age.'She's 17?'If she was 17, that meant she was in 11th grade, so she was two years younger than him... With that height and appearance, she was a high school student?\u2018How is this possible?\u2019While Hyun was shocked, Jini kept asking him questions.And finally, she asked her if she wanted to join Stardust.\"No... I'm not interested in joining any team.\"Ain refused while looking at Hyun.Jini noticed Hyun's presence because Ain was constantly looking toward someone.'This person?'At first, because her attention was focused on Ain, she hadn\u2019t noticed Hyun's presence.But after looking at Ain closely, Jini noticed that she was very aware of Hyun.She saw her constantly taking glimpses at Hyun.It looked as if she had left all the decisions to him.Then, finally, she took an interest in Hyun.'Hyun...? I feel like I've heard that name somewhere...'The first impression she had about him was that he was just Practice's friend.A few before, Practice had proudly said that he made a new friend who played Asrian.But once she asked him for details, he avoided answering any further.The reason was that his friend didn't want public attention.'Hyun...?!'At that moment\u2026Jini remembered something that a coach who had experience in Asra Online said.There was a user on the previous game who was a legend.According to what the coach had said, that user had done many unbelievable things that escaped logic and reason.\"Wait, you're Hyun?\"As Jini shouted while pointing at Hyun, Practice sighed.Hyun had asked Practice to hide his identity if possible. He never thought that Jini would find out about him like that.\"Please, don't tell the rest of the team about Hyun. Since he doesn't want to...\" Practice asked Jini with an awkward smile.\"Of course, that's not an issue!\"Jini's sparkling eyes were then focused on Hyun.\u2018Is this user really that amazing?\u2019According to the rumors, his skills and abilities were on another level compared to the rest, but it was hard to believe based on his average look.\"Don't you want to join Stardust?\"\"No.\"Just like she had done with Ain, Jini started talking to Hyun.Hyun was sweating while answering her questions. At the same time, he was thinking about a possibility.'Her job is Priest?'The only bad thing about playing alone with Ain was that there were many quests that they couldn't do alone.But what if there was a Priest with them?Suddenly, Hyun remembered a certain quest.\u2014A Heaven's Quest with an incredible reward that they couldn't try to do it yet.'Because of the story's flow, this should be the only opportunity to get this quest. If it isn't now, it should naturally disappear!'The original plan was to increase Ain's level in the Knight's Hall and then complete the achievements one by one.But there didn't seem anything wrong with changing the plans slightly.That user, Jini, seemed to have a positive image of him and Ain, so it should be okay to drag her into his plan.He cut Jini's non-stopping questions and asked her something.\"Have you ever heard about hidden quests? Fufu, how about we join parties and do one now?\"At Hyun's grim smile, Jini and Practice's eyes widened.Hidden Quest!Practice had previously experienced the feeling of extreme growth thanks to a hidden quest Hyun had given him.There was no way professional gamers didn't know the meaning of a hidden quest.\"Can... You tell someone else so easily about something like a hidden quest?\"\"It's just like Jini says! It's too burdensome to us if you suddenly say that!\"Practice seemed upset, but Hyun shook his head.Because he wanted to show off a little bit, he didn't tell them he needed a Priest.\"That's okay. I probably know about hundreds of hidden quests. This much is nothing.\"\"Even so...\"Practice tried to deny Hyun's request but ended up accepting it.Jini gulped and looked at things unfolding.It didn't take long before things went as Hyun wished.\"Ugh... I'm definitely going to pay this debt back.\"\"Haha, it's not a debt. Don't worry.\"And that was how a party of four was formed in the lobby.Jini was thinking about numerous things while looking at the relaxed Hyun.Rankers usually didn\u2019t share the information that only they knew easily.Since he had never lost the number one ranking in Asra Online, she was sure he would be similar to them... But Jini's expectations were wrong.He never lost the number one position despite having such a great personality. Did that mean that his skills are even more amazing?Since she didn't know Hyun's plans, that was the only explanation she could come up with.'Good. Anyway, this is a great opportunity to see his play style from close.'Two veterans from Asra and two professional gamers.At first glimpse, it seemed like the strongest possible party.

There only seem to be NPCs here.\"Practice and Jini mumbled.Just as the two said, the last floor had a solemn atmosphere that made it look as if the time here was frozen.Anyone could've guessed that it was a place where a very important person was.\"This is the place where the second Knight Commander is, so it's normal that the security is tight.\"\"Isn't that someone really important?\"\"Yes, the Knight Commander is a very important named NPC.\"A little while before, Hyun had said that he would receive a hidden quest from the Knight Commander.How was he thinking in approaching someone a normal user would have trouble getting close to?Except for Ain, the other two were watching Hyun with a little bit of doubt.\"If you know how to do it, it isn't hard. I'll show you what I can do, so just watch.\"Hyun made an unpleasant smile and called Ain.Up until then, unless it went against her ambition, Ain had never refused Hyun's petition.It was the same that time.\"You're planning to use \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, right?\"\"Yes, lend me your body for a while.\"Paf-! Practice and Jini were surprised when Hyun became light and scattered away. They looked around because they thought that Hyun had suddenly disappeared.\"Here.\"After looking at both of them wandering around, Ain pointed at herself.\"Right now, I'm simultaneously Hyun and Ain\u2014we're both sharing a single body.\"At first, Jini and Practice couldn't understand the situation, but they soon realized what was going on.They could hear Hyun's unique way of speaking in Ain's voice.Hyun explained \u00abAssimilation\u00bb to them.It was a skill that allowed you to share your body with another person.Jini was shocked after hearing that, while \u00abAssimilating\u00bb, both people shared their senses, among other things.\u2018Then\u2026 Does that mean that Hyun can do whatever he wants with Ain's body?\u2019Her opinion about Hyun was about to change.\"He doesn't do anything weird to your body, right?\"\"What are you talking about. It's not me but Ain who does those sort of things.\"\"Eh\u2026? What does that mean\u2026\"\"N-no? H, Hyun, why are you making such lies\u2026?!\"\"Don't you remember? There was one incident a few days ago.\"Hyun and Ain used the same body to top up each other's voices.It was curious how they could perfectly tell who was saying what despite using the same voice.\"Ain, are you okay\u2026?\"Jini asked Ain once more because she was worried.\"Oh\u2026 Yes?\"Ain avoided looking at her and remained silent.Jini, who noticed something based on Ain's reaction, stopped asking any more questions.\"Wait, if you're both controlling one body\u2026 That means\u2026!\"Practice said while clapping.\"The reason why I thought that there were two types of movements mixed in that video\u2026 Is because one of those was yours! Yeah, that was the secret behind that unbelievable multi-tasking!\"The effect of showing them \u00abAssimilation\u00bb was huge.It was truly a skill that went against common sense, and it was by far Hyun's favorite skill.\"Everyone, please wait here.\"Hyun, who had \u00abAssimilated\u00bb to Ain, walked toward a guard.It was time to receive the hidden quest.As Hyun approached the guards, they made an X and blocked the way.\"You can't go through here.\"\"Are you a user? Go back. Users aren't allowed in here.\"Even though the guards had blocked their path, Hyun wasn't surprised at all.There were some pre-requisites to activate a hidden quest.What was needed was a ranking over Grand Master, to have the runes of a Heavenly Being, and to say the keyword.Hyun was relaxed because he already knew all the requisites.\"Fufu\u2026 There's something I need to tell the Knight Commander.\"\"Hmm\u2026?\"As Hyun began talking, the Knight became more vigilant.From the outside, the girl looked pure and innocent.But the girl's tone of voice was strangely unpleasant.That happened because it was Hyun who was talking.\u300c\u2026\u300dAin just silently watched Hyun do as he pleased.Practice and Jini also looked at him suspiciously from a distance.The only one who didn't notice how strange he looked was Hyun.Hyun didn't realize that the Knight was looking at him as if he was someone suspicious.\"I came here to deliver the message of the Heavenly Being Radiette to the Knight Commander. If you see the ID, you'll notice that I not only have the category of Grand Master, but I also have the rune of a Heavenly Being. So\u2026 I'm going to pass through.\"\"You can't.\"\"Thanks. Then\u2026 Eh, what did you say?!\"\"I said that you can't pass.\"\"Why?\"\"I'm not going to say anything further.\"\"Wait, there's something weird here\u2026\"\"Don't bother me anymore. I already told you that you can't pass.\"Hyun was dumbfounded at the unexpected answer.How the conversation flowed was different from what he remembered.He had told the Knight every pre-requisite, yet was denied.'What happened\u2026? Is there another pre-requisite I don't know about?'Now that he thought about it, there was another strange thing.The Knight tried to kick him out while frowning as soon as he opened his mouth.Even if the pre-requisites were different, he didn't remember even being denied the opportunity to explain himself.Maybe\u2026 had they blocked the hidden quest with a patch?Two people were looking at the troubled Hyun from a distance.\"As expected, the way to obtain a hidden quest isn't normal\u2026 Do you need to make yourself noticed by making the NPC angry?\"\"I'm not sure that's what's happening. Maybe something went wrong?\"Jini just nodded while Practice tilted his head.After a while, Hyun came back to where they were while scratching his head.It seemed like he tried it a couple more times but ended up failing again.He used Ain's voice to mumble, 'there's no way this is happening\u2026''What went wrong\u2026? Rank over Grand Master, Heavenly Being, Radiette, was there something else I needed\u2026? I'm sure there wasn't.'What Hyun didn't think about was that Asrian's AI was more advanced than the one Asra had.Because NPCs in Asrian were more advanced, they judged the users based on what they saw and felt.From a guard's point of view, letting someone pass who laughed suspiciously was not doing their job properly.Hyun would've never guessed that he had failed in obtaining the hidden quest because of the first impression.Practice tried to give his opinion.\"What about trying it again\u2026? This time in a more relaxed tone of voice.\"Ain suddenly spoke.\"What if I try it?\"\"It's probably not going to work.\"Hyun shook his head.\"It probably will have the same result. All I can think is that the quest has been blocked because of a patch.\"\"But\u2026 I'm better at acting than Hyun.\"\"If you can't trust me, I'll have to show you.\"Second try.Hyun disassimilated and let Ain do everything.Ain waited a little bit for the Knight to change.She concluded that she wouldn't be able to convince the guard Hyun had talked to.After the guards changed, Ain walked toward them, and once again, they blocked her path.\"Users can't pass through.\"\"I have a favor to ask.\"\"Hmm? A favor?\"* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Ain's sentences were composed of short words, but at least they didn't have an unpleasant tone of voice.Rather than that, because of the clear tone of voice, everyone would just think of her as a girl of her age.\"I want to meet the Knight Commander.\"\"Hmm\u2026 That's going to be hard. He isn't someone anyone can see.\"\"But\u2026 Heavenly Being.\"\"Heavenly Being?\"\"The Heavenly Being Radiette has asked me to send him a message.\"Ain's way of speaking in short sentences was surprisingly effective.The guard's expression became more serious when she mentioned the Heavenly Beings.\"Are you telling the truth?\"\"Yes, this is the evidence.\"Ain showed her hands.There, you could see a blue lightning that shook like a wave.The Rune of a Heavenly Being, unlike an average Heaven's Rune, emitted a white light.At that moment, they developed absolute trust in Ain's words.\"This\u2026!\"After looking at the Rune in Ain's hands, the Knight's eyebrows shook.\"I'm going to guide you to the Commander's room.\"\"Wait,\" Ain said while turning around and pointing at the rest.\"I have allies with me. Can they also come?\"\"Hmm\u2026 There's no problem.\"Fufu, Ain made a triumphant smile while turning around.Hyun couldn't believe what was happening.\"What happened? Can we just pass\u2026? Is it that the Knights can let someone pass or not based on their preferences?\"\"Well, it ended up in success, so it really doesn't matter anymore, right?\" Practice said while patting Hyun on the shoulders and smiling.Even though Hyun thought about it for a while, he couldn't find the reason.Well, just like Practice said, the plan had succeeded, so it didn't matter anymore, right?They got up and followed Ain.* * *Everyone faced the Knight Commander.They were let in because, even if the four of them attacked at the same time, they wouldn't be able to harm him.At the current point of the game, the Knight Commander was overwhelmingly stronger than the users.Thankfully, in Asrian's language, there were no honorifics, so it didn't matter that Ain was talking to the Knight Commander informally.After listening to Ain's words, the Knight Commander's expression became serious.\"Hmm, it seems like, with every day that passes, the forces of the Abyss are planning even more evil things. But did you say that Radiette saw you with good eyes? You can be proud of that. After all, Heavenly Beings are never wrong.\"Suddenly, the Knight Commander frowned.A great portion of the soldiers was unavailable because of an important schedule.But if what this girl said was true, they'd have to move quickly.That was why Hyun had concluded that it was the only time they'd be able to do this quest.\"We're lacking in soldiers, so there's nothing I can do about it. If you're not busy at the moment, can you accept my request? First, I want to entrust you with a reconnaissance mission.\"Ting- After the long conversation was over, everyone got a notification.[<Heaven's Hidden Quest: Explore the Evil's Seed Dungeon>]- Incredibly, the Empire's Knight Commander has made a request to a user! This is probably the first time something like this has happened. The quest's mission is to explore a certain place. According to what the commander said, it is a place where a seed of evil has bloomed. Receiving a quest from the Knight's Commander is something rare![Reward]- Heaven's Medal of Honor x 10- Skill points based on the performance (Minimum +1 ~ Maximum +10)- Increase confidence based on the results.\"Woah!\"After reading the rewards, Practice took a deep breath.\"It's the first time I\u2019ve seen something like this\u2026 Ten skill points?\"\"Well, that's only if they reward us with the maximum amount.\"\"This\u2026 Is amazing.\"Jini also couldn't keep her mouth closed because of the surprise.It was the first time she'd seen such a huge reward while playing Asrian.With 10 Heaven's Medal of Honors, you could buy a unique item from the Heaven's Market. It truly was an incredible reward.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 -\u00a0 Knight Commander's Quest (2)On top of that, a skill bonus!Hyun and Ain were used to receiving stats or skill points as bonuses, but that wasn't the case with most users.'Can he really share a quest like this as if it were nothing?'Jini's thought deepened.She had misunderstood him a couple of times, but that was probably the real him.She was once again amazed by Hyun.'Even if he doesn't care... I can't just keep receiving!'Even among Stardust members, Jini was famous for being fast and making calculations.She could judge the situation very fast.Once again, Jini made calculations very fast.Even if the reward was good, maintaining a good relationship with Hyun was more important.Then, what should she do next?'...'While Jini was thinking with her eyes closed, the Knight Commander continued his explanation.\"Have you ever heard about the Seed of Evil?\"They all shook their heads.The Knight Commander nodded as if he were expecting that answer.Then he kept explaining important things about the quest, so everyone focused their attention on him.\"The Seed of Evil refers to an entity. From that, a demon is born, and the forces of the Abyss receive strength because of it.\"\"Seed... It's a rather ominous word.\"\"It's ominous indeed. But because it's a seed, it doesn't show its true form on the outside. It usually hides its true appearance.\"The Commander took a deep breath and lowered his voice.\"According to the rumors, it usually takes the appearance of a little girl. It only shows its true colors in certain situations.\"'A little girl...?'Hyun's eyes widened at that word.\"That's right. The demon called Seed of Evil usually moves while looking like a little girl, so you wouldn't notice her even if she's walking mixed among normal human beings... But there's one way to differentiate her.\"The more the Knight Commander's explanation went on, Hyun began feeling uneasy.The words \u2018demon\u2019 and \u2018little girl\u2019 made him remember the face of someone.What the Knight Commander said next just confirmed that his worst fear was right.\"It's borrowing the strength of the sun. The seed germinates and takes the form of evil under the sun. This is the message from the angels that the oracle told us. I've asked you to explore that place because we've received a piece of information that the Seed of Evil appeared at that place.\"Hyun's foreboding was right.The one the Knight Commander was talking about was Louise.That's right, since the first time he had seen Louise, she had a curse that made her avoid sunlight.He wished it was just coincidence, but the probability of that was low.\"Hyun...?\"Ain was surprised by Hyun's sudden, stiff expression.She didn't ask him there, but he was making an expression she'd rarely seen him make despite the fact they hung out together all the time.* * *Hyun, Ain, Practice, and Jini.Because it was an improvised party, after making simple preparations, they left to do the 'Commander's Quest.'Since it was the weekend, the two that were part of Stardust could freely move.\"So the Seed of Evil...\"Even while moving to the quest's place, Hyun's mind was full of thoughts.A few days ago\u2026No, in Asrian's time, it was more than five years ago.Louise, crying alone in the dungeon, had reminded him of a little animal who had lost her mother.He still remembered how she asked him with a trembling voice to accompany her.'That girl is really a demon?'Demons were pure evil and manipulative beings.They felt no remorse after killing and enjoyed watching the world fall into chaos.In Asra, the demons looked at humans with dichotomous eyes.Humans that serve them and humans that don't\u2026Most of those that served them were users that had chosen to side with the Abyss. There were also some weird NPCs, but that didn't mean that they thought favorably about users that belonged to the Abyss.The humans that served them were peons, and the rest were targets that must be killed.The exact way to call a demon was probably the peak of all evil.Because of Louise's personality, it was hard to think of her as a demon.'Why are things getting so complicated...'Compared to Asra, the quest's content, settings, and goal were similar, but there were some differences.Especially in things related to Louise. That was something that wasn't in the previous game.It seemed like, after the patch, the story of Asrian had begun to change.The forces of the Abyss had become stronger, and the relation between the Heavens and the Abyss had worsened.And on top of that, an NPC he hadn't heard about had appeared, So it was different from the world he remembered.He couldn't understand what triggered such changes.'Even if I think about it, I probably won't be able to find an answer.'Even if he thought about the things that changed, thinking about the previous game probably wouldn't help.He could only use the past as a reference.'I'll probably learn the truth if I see Louise once more...'That's right. He felt that, once he met Louise, the truth behind everything would be revealed.Based on the Knight Commander's explanation, he referred to Louise when he talked about the Seed of Evil... So if he followed the trays of the Seed, he would probably be able to find hits about Louise.'First, let's focus on the quest.'Hyun took the rest of the party and moved to where the quest indicated.The place where the Knight Commander told them that the Seed of Evil was discovered was the Lulumea Mountain, which was near the north pole.It was a place that was located thousands of kilometers away, so they had no other choice but to use teleport.Snowstorms rage throughout the year in the outskirts of the polar region.Moving to the place where the quest took place from the teleport gate wasn't easy.Not only were they in the middle of nowhere, but because there were lots of different monsters, they kept battling.\"I'm out of mana.\"Before they reached where the quest would take place, Ain smiled awkwardly and murmured.The Close-Range Magician's weakness!The desperately huge Mana consumption rate had grabbed Ain's ankle.There was a reason behind why Hyun and Ain hadn't hunted monsters for a while.The Close-Range Magician was bad at farming monsters.\"Already? It's only been 30 minutes since we started fighting...!\"Practice shouted in surprise while countering a monster's attack.Clang-! Jini, who was blocking a hairy goblin's attack with Holy Magic, shouted.The Ain that existed in Jini's memories was someone who just annihilated users while laughing, but how was it that she was laughing because her Mana had plummeted?\"Can't you fight without Mana?\"Ain nodded.Jini started to feel uneasy at the sight of Ain nodding with confidence.Hyun tried to defend her partner.\"Well, after all, Ain is also a Magician... So she can't fight without Mana.\"\"I see... I never thought that I, a priest, would have to be in charge of the party's offensive.\"\"I'll leave the small fights to both of you. Ain and I aren't suited to dealing with mobs.\"He could support them with \u00abOne Second Immortality\u00bb, \u00abShield\u00bb, and \u00abPowerless Wave\u00bb, but since the hunting speed didn't increase that much, Hyun didn't feel the need to participate.Instead, they decided to guide the way.But Hyun didn't seem confident, he was looking around the snowy mountain.\"Hmm... Wasn't it here...? It's been too long, so I don't remember it very well. Ain, do you remember?\"\"If Hyun doesn't know, neither I do.\"Ain shook her head.The two members of Stardust just stayed still without being able to say anything.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *How were things going to develop?It seemed like they were lost.\"Oof... But it's cold here.\"Practice, who had eliminated the nearby monsters, rubbed his hands because of the cold.Jini was also suffering because of the strong chill.There was a message in the status windows of both Stardust members.[You're feeling an extreme cold! All your movements have become 20% slower, and your HP recovering speed has decreased!]Whish- Another gust of cold wind swept through where they were standing.Practice was horrified at the cold weather of the north pole created by mother nature.\"Woah, this isn't a joke! It feels like a typhoon was blowing in the middle of winter!\"It was a cold that was hard to experience even in real life.Practice, who noticed Hyun and Ain's clothes, was horrified.\"Oh my god, Hyun... Aren't you cold while dressed like that? Ain too.\"The two seemed okay, although they were wearing very light clothes.They looked completely different from him and Jini. Both of them were shaking because of the cold, although they were wearing thick clothes.\"Oh, this? It's because of a title. That's why Ain and I don't feel cold.\"One of the effects of being a Heavenly Being was that they didn't feel cold.That was why both of them were okay, despite the extreme cold.\"A title like that... Truly amazing... No, I also want that...\"Jini, who was listening to the conversation, spoke while trembling because of the cold.Practice also tried to rush Hyun because of the cold weather.\"You still haven't found it? I feel like I'm about to die...!\"\"Oh, I think I found it! It's that way!\"Everyone ran toward where Hyun was pointing at.They all wanted to clear the quest as soon as possible.Whir- Thanks to Jini's buff, they reached the destination very quickly.\"This... is the top of the mountain.\"\"Judging by the crater's shape, it seems like the volcanic activity stopped a long time ago.\"When they entered the basin-shaped place, there was no wind blowing, so even though it was cold, they were able to endure it.Both members of Stardust had calmed down a lot.Finally, the quest was about to start.They were thinking that when Ain's words made their heart sink.\"Hyun, are you sure it's here? I think that it isn't...\"Said Ain while looking around.\"This place is the 'Ice Thorn Dungeon.' Isn't this an area where monsters over level 300 appear?\"\"Yes, that's right.\"\"What?!\"Jini and Practice, who were listening to Hyun and Ain's conversation, opened their mouths in surprise.\"Hyun, wait. Wasn't the place where our quest going to take place the 'Evil's Seed' Dungeon that began from level 80?!\"It was just as Practice was saying.There was no way someone as influential as a Knight Commander would send them to do a quest that they wouldn't be able to beat, so it was improbable that he'd send them to a place where monsters over level 300 appeared.Then, did that mean that Hyun had brought them to the wrong place and had them suffer in vain?\"Wait, don't sit on the cold floor!\"\"I can't believe the former first ranker lost the way...\"\"No, we aren't lost. We came to the right place!\"Because the rest were starting to panic, Hyun began explaining.\"If you read the quest, you'll see that it says that the reward will depend on the result.\"\"Yes, it does say that.\"Practice nodded after reading the quest.Hyun kept explaining.\"Our mission is to explore. What is the success while talking about exploring? First, we need to define that. In real life, that would be the amount of information you could find. But in a game, there must be a clear indicator.\"Hyun took a deep breath.\"It's the travel distance.\"\"Distance...?\"\"Yes. The success depends on how deep you can go in the dungeon.\"Hyun's explanation was something like this:The most important thing in Asra or Asrian at 'exploration' quests was exploring as much of the map as possible.Basically, the most effective way to clear them was trying to reach the end of the place.\"The 'Evil's Seed Dungeon' is extremely long. The deeper you go, the harder it becomes. If we tried to do it in a normal way, it would probably take us a month or maybe even more.\"\"A month...?\"\"It's obvious that we can't use that much time; that's why we're trying to take advantage of something. These two dungeons are connected through many passageways.\"Hyun took a deep breath and kept talking.\"We're going to use this dungeon and take a passageway that will allow us to reach the end of the Evil's Seed Dungeon!\"\"Hyun, but this dungeon has monsters over level 300... Isn't it going to be impossible from the beginning?\"Practice, who was listening to Hyun's explanation, asked.It was a reasonable question.Jini was about to ask the same thing.Instead of answering, Hyun looked at the sky.He was waiting for the right moment.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 - Shortcut (1)\"Ain, how many minutes do we have until the dungeon opens?\"\"Approximately 10 minutes\u2026\"\"Damn, I have no time to explain it. Well, it really doesn't matter. You'll soon realize how to go through an area with monsters over level 300.\"\"\u2026?\"While the rest of the party had question marks on top of their heads, a few seconds passed.Kwaa-!Suddenly, they began falling.\"Wh-What\u2026!\"\"Kyaa! The floor\u2026?!\"A hole appeared on top of the crater where the party was standing.As if there had been a trap from the beginning, they were sucked into the pit of the crater.A waterfall made of snow dropped through the volcano's crater!Seen from the sky, it looked like a demon's throat that devoured everything on earth.The party, which was swept away by a torrent of snow, began falling.The dungeon's only entrance was a hole so deep that its end couldn't be seen.It was the Ice Thorn Dungeon. A place where monsters that were over level 300 roamed around.\"This\u2026\"Even though the party kept dropping from the top of the mountain, after a few seconds, they kept falling.\"How long are we going to keep falling?!\" Practice shouted while feeling uneasy.Most people weren't used to the sensation of falling down.As the feeling of floating covered their bodies, they felt as if the wind was entering their body through their pores.\"Everyone, keep yourself balanced! We're going to be falling down for a while,\" Hyun shouted to the rest.At first, Practice and Jini didn't understand Hyun's words. But then, they understood.They could see the ground only after 10 seconds had passed since they began falling.After seeing what was down there, Jini and Practice's hearts sunk.What was waiting for them wasn't a flat surface. It was a very steep slope.It looked like the hardest course of a ski resort.To make things worse, they'd have to go through there with speed inherited from the fall!\"Be careful. The floor is made of ice.\"\"What\u2026?\"Jini wanted to ask something.After falling down from the sky, they had to slide through a cliff-like slope. Was that the only way to enter this dungeon?But because of the current situation, she couldn't get herself to ask the question.Hyun and Ain, who had high Agility stats, were naturally sliding down as if they were ski-jumping Olympic athletes.\"Ugh\u2026!\"Practice also stumbled, but he managed to get into position and slide down the slope.But Jini, who was a Priest, had only focused on her Magical Power and Vitality, so she lost her balance and started rolling down.\"Kyaa!\"From the party interface, they could see Jini's HP dropping.\u201cTsk,\u201d Ain said while rolling her tongue. She complained while picking up Jini.\"This happened because you didn't increase your Agility!\"From the outside, the sight of the smaller Ain picking up a woman bigger than herself looked funny. But in Asrian, your physical abilities depended on the stats you had, so it wasn't a weird sight to see.\"Wait, this is too fast! Ugh, I almost fell again!\"Practice shouted while moving his arms.His body was sliding so fast that he couldn't properly control it, and it made his mouth dry.It was a normal reaction. After all, they were sliding down a very steep cliff.\"Is this a racing game?!\"Jini, who had finally come back to her senses, asked, dumbfounded.Just like Jini said, their speed was faster than the speed of most racing game cars.The dungeon was structured like a bobsled track.It was a hellish race where you couldn't step on the brakes.The only good thing was that it was 50 meters wide, so there was no risk of hitting the wall.\"Hyun, can't we take a break?!\" Practice asked with a nervous tone of voice.\"We can't. First of all, there's no way to stop, and we need to maintain this speed.\"Hyun immediately refused Practice's request.Practice hated Hyun because of it, but those thoughts quickly disappeared.He saw giant monsters following them.It was an army of monsters that were over level 300.Monsters of an overwhelming size were trying to get them as if they were food.\"You've asked me how we're going to go through the dungeon, right?\"Hyun answered the question Practice had asked him before they entered the dungeon.How would they go through a dungeon full of monsters over level 300? They weren't even at level 100.\"You go through it like this.\"The answer was to pass through the section before they got surrounded by monsters!With the momentum of the fall and going down a steep cliff without any brakes, they were going as fast as a bullet.Suddenly, demons appeared from the sides and blocked them.Crack-! They were aggressively scratching the ice.But the attacks didn't reach Hyun or the rest of the party thanks to their incredibly fast speed.They were way past the demon's attack range in the blink of an eye.Before demons could approach them, they were slipping down the underground cavity.The speed was way above what a normal human could experience in real life.[You went through the area of the middle boss 'Lamia'!][You've explored 12% of the dungeon!]Just like Hyun said, both dungeons were connected from the inside.The message they got wasn't from that place but from the Evil Seed's Dungeon.Because they shared the depth, they could explore the dungeon in such a way.Jini was horrified at the message.\"12%? Didn't we go through at least five kilometers?!\"\"The Evil's Seed Dungeon is extremely large. Just like I said before, if we went through the normal route, it would have taken us at least a month at least,\" Hyun answered.\"That\u2026!\"The party went through all the opponents very quickly.All the monsters near the entrance couldn't keep up with their speed and fell down. So there were just the four of them sliding down the ice.Although there was no one chasing them, they couldn't slow down.Hyun shouted again when two paths appeared in front of the party.\"We need to take the left route!\"\"Okay.\"Crack- Ain changed direction first while scratching the ice.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Because of the inertia, Practice almost couldn't change directions and fell to the right side. But thanks to Hyun, he could join the rest of the party.[You've explored 16% of the dungeon!]After making sure everyone had taken the correct route, Hyun spoke with a very serious voice tone.\"It's going to get dangerous from here, so everyone, please be careful.\"\"How can it get more dangerous than now\u2026?!\"\"The monsters that appear from this point onwards react faster than those before.\"Twirl-!Suddenly, something flew toward Hyun.Hyun quickly changed direction and avoided being hit.The party turned their heads after the danger was over. Just then, they saw what had flown toward Hyun.\"A frog\u2026?\"A monster with a disgusting appearance was flicking its tongue.What had targetted Hyun was that monster's tongue.Just like a bear snatching a salmon from a torrent, it had tried to grab Hyun.Soon, they got far away from the monster. But the appearance of that ugly demon had gotten imprinted in the group's memories.\"Everyone saw it, right? You have to dodge that thing very well.\"\"Dodging something so fast\u2026? It seemed too close.\"\"Well, we're going through at a very fast speed, so each one will probably be able to attack us once. It isn't as hard as it seems.\"Swoosh-!Another tongue came flying toward them.That time, it was targetting Ain.Ain jumped up with Jini in her arms.\"Ugh?!\"Jini subconsciously screamed at the same time that Ain jumped.Although Jini was surprised, because she was a professional gamer, she didn't close her eyes.She was a professional gamer because she could react to any situation.Ain flew for a short while because she'd jumped from the slope.She could make acrobatic movements in the air thanks to her high Agility stat.Crack- A short while after jumping, she landed on the track and matched the speed of the rest.\"It's okay. I have more Agility than Hyun.\"Hyun nodded.If it was Ain, she could probably go through the area even with Jini in her arms.The two looked at each other and then changed the formation.Hyun at the left, Ain at the right.They left Practice in the middle.Because the edges were more dangerous, they'd placed Practice in the middle.It wasn't that they were underestimating him.Everyone would have trouble imitating something they'd seen only once, so they wanted him to get used to the current speed.\"Don't relax.\"Twirl, Twirl-!As they entered the frogs\u2019 territory, tongues flew to them from both sides.Any user under level 300 would instantly die.Not only that but they would get eaten by the monster. It was a horrible way to die.Jini, who was already disgusted by the monster's appearance, was horrified.\"Please, dodge them. You're the only one I can trust\u2026!\"It seemed like she'd imagined herself entering the monster's digestive system.But because her Agility was low, all she could do was rely on Ain.\"I'm concentrating, so please remain silent.\"Ain went through the middle of a lot of monsters.She saw the monsters targetting them from the front and the sides.Swoosh-! The moment three tongues flew toward them, Ain threw Jini into the air.\"Huh\u2026?!\"She avoided the first one by moving diagonally and dodged the second one by blending her back.The last one she brushed away with her arm.Then, she jumped again.Another tongue was about to wrap around Jini.But before it could do it, Ain grabbed Jini.\"Ugh\u2026!\"Jini, who had been grabbed by Ain, took a deep breath.She was so surprised that she couldn't find any words to say.Ain landed on the floor and kept sliding down.At the same time, many attacks went flying toward Hyun too.No, there were probably more monsters targetting Hyun.Hyun laughed at the sight of the numerous tongues flying toward him.\"You're not going to get me.\"The tongues of many level 300 monsters tried to smash where Hyun was standing.That horrifying sight was probably a death sentence for Hyun.But Hyun's body wasn't there anymore.Just before being hit by the tongues, Hyun had \u00abAssimilated\u00bb into Ain.Hyun had chosen the more dangerous side because he had the most OP skill to avoid being hit, \u00abAssimilation\u00bb.When he \u00abDisassimilated\u00bb, he inherited Ain's inertia.As long as he remembered that, he wouldn't have any trouble.'Damn, he's going to get hit!'A tongue flew toward Practice.Practice still hadn't gotten used to sliding down.The moment he was about to get hit by the tongue\u2026'\u00abDisassimilation\u00bb!'Hyun suddenly appeared in front of Practice and blocked the flying path of the tongue.He had received the hit in place of Practice.The long tongue managed to grab Hyun in the air.Practice's heart sunk after seeing Hyun in trouble, but he was worried about nothing.While being dragged by the tongue, Hyun scattered away into light and entered Ain.As long as Hyun had the \u00abAssimilation\u00bb skill, the average attack wouldn't be able to get him.Krrrr-! The demonic frog cried angrily.But the only thing it could do was angrily look at its prey getting away.\"Oof, thanks, Hyun\u2026!\"\"I told you these things won't be able to get me.\"Soon, tongues stopped coming from the sides.They had successfully gone through the demonic frogs\u2019 territory.Numerous system messages appeared in front of the party.[You went through the Demonic Beast Kendanis's area!][You went through the dark bridge!][You went through the middle floor!][You've crossed the blood river!][You've explored 42% of the dungeon!]There was still a long way to go.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - Shortcut (2)\"Are we halfway there...?\"What Hyun murmured woke up the rest of the party, who were overwhelmed by the number of system messages.Just like he said, monsters that were more dangerous than those before would be waiting for them from that point onwards, so they couldn't relax yet.\"To the right!\"Once again, the road was divided into two possible ways.As Hyun shouted, the party scratched the floor and changed the direction in which they were sliding.Practice had started to get used to the speed.The dungeon was structured so that they had no other option but to go down constantly.If they made a mistake, they wouldn't be able to meet each other again, so they had to be careful that they didn't get far away from each other.\"Good, everyone managed to follow!\"[In just 12 minutes and 37 seconds, you've traveled 30 kilometers!][It's an amazing achievement! Your Agility has gone up by 3 points!]Suddenly, everyone got a notification from the system.The message Hyun received was a little bit different from the rest.The content was almost the same, but the number of stats received differed.[Your Agility has gone up by 4 points!]Thanks to the bonus of being part of the Abyss, he received an extra 30% of the achievement bonus!In reality, it was 3.9, but it had been rounded up.Practice was surprised after reading his message.\"30 kilometers?! We already passed the mountain's height!\"\"Yes, that's right. It's been a while since we entered the dungeon. We're currently in the territory of the Abyss.\"Even while talking, they kept descending at a speed close to falling.The deeper they went, the closer they got to the Abyss.The color of the floor had changed from transparent as glass to a blood-red one.From a distance, they looked like drops of water dripping from the surface of a giant ruby.\"This place... Looks like a demonic territory,\" Jini said while looking around nervously and biting her lips.Thousands of torches that burned while emitting green light illuminated the passageway.No, it was too steep to call it a passageway. It was as if they were going through the entrance of hell.The party kept falling as if they were being swept down to hell's mouth.\"What...?\"Practice couldn't keep his mouth shut at the sight that appeared before him.\"It's getting steeper?!\"\"This is just a cliff!\"The terrain in front of them was so steep that it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call it a cliff.It was no different than falling into the Abyss.Practice and Jini were horrified.Not only because of the unbelievable angle of the terrain but also because, although they were in the same situation, Hyun and Ain were calm.\"We're surrounded by a red color.\"\"What?\"\"The red color is like a warning. We're about to enter the territory of the middle boss.\"Hyun explained the meaning to the rest.\"You're kidding, right...? The middle boss during a situation like this? I can barely move!\"Practice shouted.Even while talking, he tried his best to get the balance.To move, he needed a place where to steep foot, and on such a steep road, that was impossible.\"Well, leave this place to Ain and me.\"\"There's a way, right?!\"\"Probably.\"Hyun remembered the plan once again.How was he planning to go through the middle floor boss's territory?It was the most important and hardest part.However, Hyun had been able to come up with an answer to many difficult situations, so he was sure he would be able to come up with a solution again.\"It's coming!\"Kaaaaaa-!A monster suddenly came flying from the underground.With its wings wide-opened, the giant and hideous bird looked like it was at least 20 meters.The sharp cry made it look as if it were saying that they were entering its territory.[You're exposed to a very strong Abyss's power!][You can't resist because of the huge difference in power!][All your stats have been decreased by 20%!]\"Ugh...!\"Practice subconsciously groaned...There was a system in Asrian that made you feel scared while facing an extremely strong opponent.Jini was also overwhelmed.\"We can't escape! This boss can keep up with our speed!\"\"It's this fast?!\"The monster was keeping up with the party's speed, who were basically in the middle of a free fall.Up until then, they'd avoided facing monsters thanks to the speed of the fall, but now that they'd encountered one that was faster than them, they couldn't use the same strategy.\"Hyun, do we have to fight against this?\"\"No, it's impossible for us to beat it!\"\"Then\u2026?\"\"We have to resist until we get through its territory!\" Hyun shouted.Because he'd asked them before the quest began, he knew the skills of both Stardust members.\"Jini, please use \u00abBind\u00bb on all the party members!\"\u00abBind\u00bb was an exclusive skill of the Priest\u2014it was a skill that bound everyone's bodies with a solid light.Those connected by the rope of light couldn't separate more than a certain distance.Usually, it was a skill used to tie the feet of an opponent, but because it had low durability, it wasn't a very useful skill.\"Done!\"As Jini activated her skill, a rope that tied the party members together appeared.\u2018Wouldn't tieing our bodies together make things more difficult since it limits our movements?\u2019Despite thinking that, Jini didn't doubt using her skill for even a second. That was because she'd developed a trust in Hyun.Kwaaa-!As soon as Jini used her skill, the monster began flapping its wings.A gust of wind so strong that it made it difficult to keep their eyes open came from the front.The monster was trying to separate them with brute force.Practice almost lost his balance and was about to bounce away, but the rope tied to his waist supported him.That was the effect of \u00abBind\u00bb.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The theory was similar to Cao Cao's strategy in the Battle of Red Cliff. In that historical battle, Cao Cao had tied his boats with steel chains.\"Keep resisting!\"Skreeeee-!The monster\u2019s attack had just begun.Thorns appeared on its giant wings.Each of the thorns was thick like a spear\u2014they were formed by magical energy that emitted a dark aura.Bang-!As the monster flapped its wings, hundreds of thorns flew toward them.'Now!'Hyun had been prepared to act from the moment the monster opened its wings.Just before the monster launched its attack, Hyun used 'The Ring of the Executioner.'He then unbound from the rope and dashed up the slope by himself.Whir-!The thorns that were scattered away gathered in one place.The effect of the ring that dragged all attacks to where the person wearing the ring was had activated.'It's just like that time... But it was different from before.'While escaping with Louise, he had used \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb to protect against all attacks... But right now, he couldn't use the same strategy.The opponent in front of them was a level 400 boss monster.Just being touched by one thorn would be enough to kill them.'I can't get hit.'Before his body got destroyed, Hyun scattered away into the light!Hyun had \u00abAssimilated\u00bb into Ain.Even after Hyun disappeared, the thorns moved because of inertia and were stuck on the slope behind them.Bang! Boom!As the thorns hit the wall, the entire surface moved because of impact.\"Ugh...!\"\"Eek!\"Although their bodies were shaking, the rope kept them together.Thanks to that, they could maintain their balance while going down a shaking slope.Jini, who was in Ain's arms, smiled bitterly.\"This... First, it was a racing game, then a shooter...!\"\"It isn't over yet!\"Hyun shouted while \u00abDisassimilating\u00bb.The pattern of the boss attacking with thorns kept repeating for a while.Because the rest of the party couldn't move due to the \u00abBind\u00bb, Hyun had to control the direction of the thorns.Flap-! Once again, the monster launched the thorns, and Hyun jumped.The Ring of the Executioner was still on Hyun's finger.Whir-!The ring dragged all the attacks to a single point.And once more, just before he could get hit\u2026'\u00abAssimilation\u00bb.'He disappeared\u2026'\u00abDisassimilation\u00bb.'And appeared again.It looked like Hyun was using teleportation.Although many thorns flew constantly, none hit any of the party members.Smash-!As the thick thorns got stuck in the slope, part of it fell down.Unfortunately, one of the thorns tore down the rope that was binding Practice.\"Damn...!\"After losing his balance because of the intense vibration under his feet, Practice was about to bounce up.\"Ain...! Can you do it?\"\"You don't need to ask these sorts of things!\"At Hyun's shout, Ain jumped upward.The moment she jumped, the surface under her feet crumbled.Two thorns had gotten stuck on the slope, and the terrain surrounding them was crumbling.In the air, Ain was grabbing Jini with one hand, and with the other, she snatched Practice.\"\u00abBind\u00bb!\"Jini immediately used her skill on Practice.Ain kept floating for a few seconds until she could land on the slope, and then she kept sliding.\"Ain, don't get too far away from me!\"Hyun gave Ain a warning.To use \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, she had to be within 20 meters. If the distance between them increased, the skill wouldn't activate.Then he would die at that place immediately.\"Don't separate from me too much!\"Kaaaa-!Because its attack wasn't working as it wished, the monster cried out angrily.As the sharp cry pierced Hyun's eardrums, he became more focused.He knew what that cry meant.'It's the final phase...!'Flap-! As the monster curled up and then opened its wings, many thorns flew toward them.The attack pattern of the thorn attacks was irregular. Sometimes, it was a surprise attack, and in cases others, a continuous fire.'If I get hit even once, it's over.'Whir- The Ring of the Executioner cried sadly.At the same time, the complex attack pattern of the monster changed directions while mid-air.Thanks to Hyun dragging all the attacks, a safety zone was created in the middle of the barrage.While hiding in the safety zone created by Hyun, the party kept sliding downward.[You went through the Fire Shrine!][You found a sky in the middle of the Abyss!][You've found a shadow road!][You've explored 93% of the dungeon!]\"We're almost there!\" Hyun shouted.\"Look down!\"At Hyun's shout, everyone saw that there were three possible paths.The red scenery ended from there.That meant that the territory of the middle boss ended there.\"Take the middle road!\"While looking at the monster, he pointed the direction to go to the rest of the party.The attack pattern of the middle boss was getting more violent.\u00abAssimilation\u00bb used 50 mana.Hyun's mana was almost empty.Smash-!The monster tried to smash Hyun with its claws.From its point of view, it was probably angry. Since it didn't matter how many thorns it sent flying, he just dodged them all as if he were a mouse.As the monster's claw scratched the slope, an enormous vibration shook the party members.\"Kyaa!\"\"Ah...\"All the party members, including Ain, were swept away because of the vibration.The party floated in the air as if they were leaves being swept away by a typhoon.Although, thanks to \u00abBind\u00bb, they didn't separate.\"That's the wrong way!\"Unfortunately, the direction they were falling was not the one Hyun had indicated.Hyun's heart sank.If they went to the right, they would reach the Ice Thorn's Dungeon's next area. It was a place where monsters that were over level 400 appeared\u2014it was the beginning of the Hell of the Abyss.'There aren't any more crossroads after this...!'Kieeee-!The monster that was following them cried angrily.As the road became narrower, it couldn't follow them anymore.Boom- As the giant body hit the walls, it caused a huge shock.An earthquake shook the entire place.\u00abDisassimilate\u00bb!But right then, Hyun couldn't hear anything.Paf-! He appeared next to Ain.While falling down, he pushed Ain's body with all his strength.'A little bit more...'Because of \u00abBind\u00bb, Jini and Practice were also thrown together with Ain.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 - Shortcut (3)It was a close call.While falling from the sky, the party had managed to go through the middle hole as if they were diving into it.'Did everyone enter the right one?'They quickly passed through the three possible pathways, soon disappearing from their sight.It seemed like, except for Hyun, everyone had entered the middle hole.Even after going through the pathway, the party kept sliding down for a while.The steep slope began easing.The speed at which they were sliding down began decreasing.They reached a completely flat surface as if they'd reached the bottom of a ski resort.The race had finally ended.\"Oof... That last one was dangerous.\"Hyun, who had come out from Ain's body, sighed in relief.If he had used \u00abAssimilation\u00bb a little bit later, he would have gotten far away from the rest of the party.Because of the Ice Thorn Dungeon's structure, you couldn't go back once you had already gone through a road.But if the target was within 20 meters, he could use \u00abAssimilation\u00bb.That's why, at the last moment, even though Hyun couldn't see Ain, he could join them by using \u00abAssimilation\u00bb.\"Is it finally over...?\"Practice and Jini had also started to calm down.Practice sighed in relief. He shook his head while having a look of dismay on his face.\"I think I understand how you guys usually play...\"Even from the point of view of a professional gamer, that wasn't a normal gaming style.If he thought it was just 'a little bit dangerous'... Hyun's idea of risk was different from those of an average person.Hyun tried to avoid looking at Jini.\"Ugh, I mean... What just happened.\"Did he proceed too recklessly without an explanation?Yes, anyone would be surprised if things went on like that without receiving a proper explanation beforehand.He was about to say sorry because of his lack of explanation when unexpected words came out of Jini's mouth.\"Hyun... You.\"After trying to calm down, Jini spoke.Hyun was an unbelievable player.How he moved, his judgment, his timing, even a professional gamer would be no match to him.\"You have no intentions to become a professional gamer, right...?\"\"Yes...\"She thought that it was too bad that a user like him had no intentions of becoming a professional gamer.But she couldn't force him.Since she thought of maintaining a good relationship with him, she didn't want to bother him by asking something he wasn't interested in.Jini began thinking.'Yes, even if I can't bring him to Stardust...'The next thing Jini thought about was that video that had become a hot topic in their team.The last battle of the Count's Quest.It seemed like Practice had studied Ain's movements from that video, but she was a Priest, so she focused her attention on how Ain dealt with the long-range attacks.\u2014How she made any long-range attack ineffective was way over the level a Priest or Magician wanted to reach.And now, she had discovered that the one who had done that was Hyun.'If I can learn from that play, even a little bit...!'Just like Practice, Jini had also tried to analyze the video.But it was hard to understand the principle's behind Hyun's movements since he saw space in a complex way.While moving from a distance, you had more freedom than those at close range, so analyzing it was that much harder.Not only that, but Hyun also moved while taking into consideration the flow of the battle. So without a proper explanation, it was even harder to understand them.'Finally, the perfect chance has come!'Jini had made up her mind.Maybe it would be rude to ask something like this the first time they met each other.But Jini was a very passionate professional gamer.Jini, who had reached a conclusion inside her head, shouted.\"Hyun, please teach me!\"\"Huh...?\"Practice, who was listening next to her, seemed surprised.Ain's expression was similar to Practice's.\"Eh...? What do you mean...\"As Hyun answered with a question, Jini understood she'd made a mistake.\"Oh, I'm sorry! I said it too suddenly...! But I'm being honest! Even if you don't want to become a professional gamer, you can teach someone. Right?\"After looking at Hyun's gameplay style, it seemed like the professional gamer switch had turned on.The way she continued to mumble what she felt resembled a girl who longed for an idol.The impression Hyun had left on her was that strong.How his perfectly calculated movements flowed like water\u2026Jini could see the meticulous calculations behind Hyun's movements.The reason why she suddenly asked him that was because she was fascinated with Hyun's gameplay.\"You want me to teach you...?\"\"Of course, I'll pay you accordingly!\"Hyun, who finally understood what Jini meant, began thinking deeply.Hyun had never thought about teaching someone else. Actually, that was the first time someone had asked him that.By her looks, Hyun knew Jini was serious about it.'It's too sudden, but...'Hyun began wondering about it seriously.Because he had just entered University, he wasn't used to deals like that.Once Hyun thought of Jini's request as a quest, he felt like his thoughts were being organized.'Hmm... I guess I have nothing to lose.'From Hyun's point of view, it was normal that both average and professional gamers lacked in terms of basics.The battle theory Ain and he had learned over the years wasn't something that one could learn in a short period of time.Just learning one thing would probably take them a lot of time, so it wouldn't be too much of a bother to him.Even if he taught them advanced things, they wouldn't be able to learn them. Also, he had no intention of teaching them those things easily.'What do I have to earn?'Hyun began making some calculations.He included the tuition fees Jini mentioned and extra benefits he could get inside the game in his calculations.'Wait, it isn't a bad deal at all!'Jini flinched at the sudden change in Hyun's atmosphere.Hyun was laughing suspiciously.After a while, Hyun nodded.\"Okay.\"\"R-Really?\"\"After all, you're someone who JaeHoon knows.\"Hyun talked as if he was making her a favor.\"But I have a few conditions.\"\"Conditions...?\"\"First, you must show me your status window. I need to know your specs before teaching you.\"Showing your status window meant more than showing someone your ID in real life.\u2014Because your stats and skills were like your patrimony.Especially for a professional gamer, that must have been a hard requirement to follow.\"I have no issues with that!\"Jini nodded without thinking about it twice.It was because she was that passionate about learning.After nodding, Hyun kept talking.\"The other one is that you need to help me when I ask you.\"\"When?\"\"Whenever... It can be helping with a quest or fighting against another user. The number of times I'm going to ask you... Well, we can define that later on, right?\"Jini seemed to think about that requirement for a little while but ended up nodding.\"It doesn't matter as long as it doesn't overlap with the team's schedule. No, as long as it isn't an important meeting, I'll ignore the schedule!\"'Is she serious...?'Hyun began having doubts after hearing her smooth answer.From what he heard from JaeHoon, Asrian's professional gamers seemed to have a very tight schedule\u2026* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Anyway, if she could manage her schedule, it wasn't a bad deal.Jini probably ranked high among Priests, so being able to count on someone like that whenever he wanted was a great benefit.\"Hyun, can I also learn...?\"Practice, who had been listening silently, suddenly asked.He was surprised when Jini had suddenly asked Hyun that, but as things flowed weirdly, he also decided to ask him.\"Of course.\"\"R-really?!\"\"One or two. It really doesn't make a difference, so it doesn't matter.\"Practice seemed moved at Hyun's answer. It looked as if he were about to cry.If he let him be, he was probably going to bow, so Hyun quickly waved his hands to dissuade him from doing that.Hyun felt a little bit awkward.He had received many things from JaeHoon. Not only whenever they met, but he had also paid for the dinner and taken him home in his car.But the only thing Hyun had done for him was tell him about a quest that helped him level up a little bit.Not only that, but he'd made him abandon the Count's Quest since it interfered with his goals.'I think that I also need to provide a little bit.'While thinking that, simultaneously, Hyun was thinking about how to use Practice's abilities.Calculating the profits and losses within the game was part of Hyun's nature, so there was nothing he could do about it.That's how he made a deal with Practice that was similar to the one he'd done with Jini.While smiling generously, Hyun was excited on the inside.* * *They still needed to discuss the pay, but they decided to talk about that once the quest was over.The atmosphere of the party had improved.The two professional gamers couldn't hide their happiness from being taught by Hyun.Hyun seemed satisfied because of a similar reason.Only Ain looked at Jini with suspicious eyes at first but then stopped.After recovering their Mana and HP, the party started to move again.[You've explored 98% of the dungeon!]The Ice Thorn Dungeon had many steep slopes, but the Evil's Seed Dungeon was the complete opposite.It was a maze that was so long and complex that you just couldn't see its end.The probability of getting lost if you relaxed too much was high, and finding the correct road would take a lot of time too.It was very time-consuming. Especially when they had to go through a passageway from where malice came out.They had to wait for Jini's Mana to replenish to recover HP.It was impossible to predict how long it would have taken them if they hadn't used a shortcut.They were exploring such a dark maze.Sometimes, they smashed down some walls to shorten the time.In many cases, the thick-looking walls were surprisingly lax.The reason why they could find spaces like that was thanks to Hyun's memories.But no matter how much they walked, the dungeon exploration rate didn't seem to advance.[You've explored 98% of the dungeon!]\"The remaining 2% is not decreasing,\" said Ain, who was bored of just walking.\"It's a very long dungeon. If we'd done the quest normally, it would have taken us a month at least.\"[You've explored 99% of the dungeon!]The progress rate increased an hour after they began exploring the maze.As they crossed a bridge made of skulls, a door that seemed to be 15 meters wide appeared in front of them.'Seeing it vividly like this is kind of creepy.'Hyun remembered the past while looking at the devilish decorations that were on the door.The Door of the Deceased\u2014its name was probably something like that.From what he remembered, the red frame was made of dried corpses.Jini, who had a weak stomach, wanted to vomit after noticing that.Practice also had a dark expression on his face.Only Hyun and Ain were okay.Ain, who was next to Hyun, rather than disgusted, seemed excited.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 - The Last Gatekeeper, Betty (1)\"Hyun, do you remember this place? We've cleared this one together before.\"\"Really? From what I remember, I was alone.\"\"Hng...? Alone?\"Ain stared at Hyun.Hyun ignored her stare and tried to remember.Oops, now that he thought about it, he had indeed come to that place with Ain.\"No... We did come here together. That's right. Even back then, we were together.\"But there were some differences with that time.He could immediately find a difference.From what he remembered, in Asra, a mid-range boss was blocking the door... But right then, there didn't seem to be one.\"Doesn't it seem like the map has changed a little bit?\"\"Yes, I was thinking the same thing.\"Hyun nodded at Ain's question.From what he remembered, in Asra, the dungeon's name was different.He didn't remember the name, but he was sure that if it were something like Seed of Evil, he would've remembered it.'Why did it change?'Asrian had slight differences from the previous game.The first one was the appearance of an unknown NPC called Louise.The existence of a symmetrical world\u2026Even the name of the dungeon had changed\u2026He had a strange feeling as if he was missing something.He felt that if he thought about it a little bit more, he would be able to connect all the parts.Hyun was thinking about all the different pieces of evidence separated like a puzzle.\"So this is the last one.\"Practice's mumble brought Hyun back to reality.He looked up at the Door of the Deceased and mumbled.\"At first glance, this seems like a place where a boss would be.\"\"It does.\"Just like Practice said, there was only one enemy left before they cleared the quest.It was the opponent that was behind the door.They wouldn't be able to beat the last part of the quest by using tricks, so it was the place where the party would fight the final battle.Before the battle began, Hyun started to explain.\"The last opponent is a named called 'Betty.' It's a humanoid bat monster that uses Magic. In Asra, we used to call her bat girl.\"\"Betty...?\"Jini, who was listening to Hyun's words spoke.The moment she heard the name Betty, her face became darker.After seeing that, Practice asked her a question.\"Is there something you know about her?\"\"I've previously heard information about the named Betty.\"Stardust had a database of many monsters.It was made with the help of the coach that had experience in Asra Online they had just incorporated.Betty was a name she'd found out by going through the information.\"It's a named boss that's level 235. You need at least 10 users that have completed the second job ascension to try to beat it.\"\"A level 235 boss? Really?\"\"Yes, I'm sure!\"Jini showed the rest of the information about Betty that was in Stardust's database through one of the functions of the capsule.\"Oh, my god\u2026\"Practice's mouth dropped open.\"What, why is everyone suddenly so scared?\"At Hyun's question, Practice carefully asked him.\"Hyun, can we really beat it...?\"\"Of course, the giant bird we meet in the Ice Thorn Dungeon was a level 400 named boss.\"\"But we didn't fight it.\"\"Hmm... That's true, but it's okay. If it's our party, I think we're going to be able to beat it.\"Jini became more relaxed after listening to Hyun's affirmation.She started to accept Hyun's words as the truth at some point.His judgment was probably more precise than hers!Following her common sense would probably make things harder, so she decided not to think about it too much.If you look closely, Ain didn't doubt Hyun's words.Although she spoke roughly from time to time, you could feel that she trusted Hyun.Before they entered, Hyun explained to them the strategy to beat Betty.The theory behind the strategy was perfect.The problem was that it was perfect only in theory.Neither professional gamers nor average users thought about every single possible variable like Hyun.Humans often made mistakes, which was why the prepared strategies failed most of the time.'Does he always prepare so much?'When Hyun's explanation was over, Practice and Jini were lost for words.The reason why he prepared the strategies with so much detail was that he was sure there wouldn't be any mistakes?'This is a strategy that, if you didn\u2019t have skills and self-confidence in yourself, you wouldn't be able to come up with.''An average user would probably be committing suicide if they tried to copy it\u2026!'Guooo-.The Door of the Deceased opened, and the room's interior was revealed.The entire floor was covered with lava.And in the middle of it, there was a giant island.\"Everyone, watch out for your feet.\"Hyun warned the rest.The only way to get to the island was by crossing a narrow bridge.If they missed a step, they'd fall into the lava.Jini, who had low Agility, was having a hard time moving.[Because of the heat, your HP goes down by 50 points every 10 seconds!]From a certain point, the party started to receive messages.Hyun, who was the only one who belonged to the Abyss, had 10% of resistance to fire, so the message he saw was a little bit different.[Because of the heat, your HP goes down by 45 points every 10 seconds!]Even if they remained still, their HP would go down.If the pain sensor was adjusted to real-life levels, there would be so much heat surrounding the place that humans wouldn't be able to resist it.To keep their HP up, Jini had to use recovery skills frequently.'Too hot. We're surrounded by a sea of fire.'Practice moaned because of the heat that the lava transmitted.Hyun and Ain couldn't feel cold thanks to the 'Heavenly Being' title, but they weren't immune to heat.Boom-!The moment the party crossed the bridge, the doors closed.Then a wave of lava swallowed the bridge they'd just used.\"Don't panic.\"Even if Hyun hadn't said it, they would\u2019ve been calm.Hyun had already told them that the moment the battle began that there would be no way to exit.The island that would soon become a battlefield was the size of a football field.Wham-.As a lava waterfall began to flow from all sides, the party moved to a safe place.\"Watch out!\"As Jini shouted, magma began coming out from the mouth of a strange-looking statue.Tsss-~As Practice subconsciously moved his body, he could hear the sound of rock melting.\"This is really a hell of fire.\"The place seemed like it would be interesting to see if it weren't for the fire surrounding it.Thanks to Roman-style architecture, the island looked like an abandoned underground city.The party went up the stairs.From the terrace of the building, they could see the entire island.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Hundreds of lava waterfalls covered the entire city.That was the most fantastic scenery Hyun had seen since he began playing Asrian.\"Amazing...\"Ain was mesmerized by the hundreds of lava waterfalls.The lava kept raising, and it began to swallow the city's buildings one by one.Then a tsunami of lava struck everything and left it all in ruins.\"It's coming.\"And once it finally stopped\u2026Boom-!Something dropped from the sky as if it were a meteorite.The silhouette of the demon slowly extended its wings and raised its body.Jini mumbled while biting her lips.\"Betty...\"The 'Evil's Seed' Dungeon's final boss.The guardian of the area, Betty, had appeared.Betty had the appearance of a woman and black wings. It looked like a bat.As Betty extended its wings, the energy of the Abyss began spreading through the entire place.\"Kiik... Servants... Of Heaven...\"[You've encountered a massive Abyss's presence!][You offer very little resistance!][All your stats have been decreased by 20%!]The message Hyun and Ain received was a little bit different.[A Heavenly Being isn't easily intimidated by the energy of the Abyss!][All your stats have been decreased by 5%!]'There's nothing we can do about the difference in specs.'The deeper they went, the harder the dungeon became.Because Betty was the dungeon's final boss, it had overwhelming specs.'It doesn't matter.'He wasn't expecting to be able to overcome Betty's Abyss energy perfectly.The strategy he was thinking of wasn't about beating it with specs, but was a way to overcome the gap.\"Jini, start!\"\"I know!\"Before Hyun spoke, Jini was in front of the party.\"To think that a day would come when I, a Priest, would be in the front!\"While shaking her legs, Jini didn't back off. She was doing her best to face the Abyss's energy emitted by Betty.Why was Jini in the front?It would be normal to ask that question, but Jini was just moving as Hyun had ordered her.\"Jini, you must always be in front of Betty.\"Just before entering the room, Jini thought she had misheard Hyun's words.To think that he'd ask her, a Priest who needed to be protected by the rest of the party, to be in the front!But after listening to Hyun's explanation, she understood why.\u201cBetty's scariest skill is 'Rear Leap.' It instantly teleports to the back of the party and smashes the target with the tail. We won't be able to dodge or block it with our current level.\u201d\"Then, there's no way to counter it. Right...?\" Practice had murmured in worry.\"The target of the Rear Leap is always fixed: it's the one that's furthedy away from it. Basically, the one that's at the back of the party!\"At the back of the party, there usually was either a Priest or a Magician.That's why there was a huge chance that Jini would become the first target of the boss.\"Understood? You must always be in the front.\"Paf-!The moment Betty disappeared, Jini shrugged her shoulders.If it weren't for Hyun's warning, she would've moved to the back of the party or used a defensive skill on herself.Using a survival skill while in danger was a habit that most Priest's had in common.'It's going to be okay.'But right then, she had placed all her trust in Hyun.She didn't try to avoid it.If she suddenly became the target, she would end up dying. There was nothing to do.But if Hyun's guess were correct, Betty would appear at the party's rear!Boom!Betty's tail smashed down half of the building's terrace where the party was.Concentric circles spread through the sea of lava.The power of a level 235 named boss was truly awe-inspiring.They would've probably all died if it weren't for the previous preparations.'Good, everyone's safe.'Hyun was at the party's rear.The moment Betty disappeared, he used \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, so Betty ended up hitting the air.'Now!'At that moment, Betty had finished casting.It was her skill, \u00abBind\u00bb, which made two targets stick together.The rope made of light that she shot without considering her own safety successfully landed on Betty.Betty, who was about to take flight, was trapped by Jini's rope.\"I've stuck it to the floor!\"Jini shouted joyfully.Binding an opponent that moved at an incredible speed required a high level of control.It was something that you could only do if you knew where the opponent would appear.While Betty was stuck, Practice's sword hit its neck.[\u00abMind Beat\u00bb has successfully critical hit!][The opponent has fainted for a bit!]At that moment\u2026!Ain used her flames to hit Betty.A pair of flames hit the giant bat's body.Kaaaa-!As Betty moved in pain, the rope that was binding her broke.That was enough for the moment.Before it could take flight, Ain had landed more than 10 successful attacks on its body.Betty, who was near the ceiling, looked at the party.Suddenly, Hyun shouted.\"Jini, don't be in the rear!\"Jini, who was taken aback, rapidly moved to the front.Shortly after that, Betty disappeared.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For a little while, they could see the floor under the lava.Being covered by lava had no effect on Betty.\"Ugh, the magma...!\"Practice moaned.Suddenly, magma had splashed and reached where they were standing.He had been approaching Betty just at that moment, so he received quite a lot of damage from the lava.The lava scattered away by Betty reached Ainas well.\"Ugh...!\"Ain reflexively turned her body around in the air.The red drops passed right next to Ain, but thanks to her smooth movements, she dodged them all.'Damn, it's coming again!'Skreee-!Betty, who was circling around in the air, flinched.Hyun looked around.Who was the person furthest away from Betty?It was Practice.He was lingering at the edge of the map.He couldn't get quickly into formation because he was covered in lava.At his teammate's crisis, Hyun's mind flashed.'I'm the only one that can deal with this!'Paf-! Hyun \u00abDisassimilated\u00bb and appeared in a certain place.\u2014Over the sea of lava.That was the furthest away place that he could find from Betty.Then, Betty's tail smashed into the air.Whish-!There was a sound of air exploding.Maybe the speed of Betty's tail smash was faster than the speed of sound.The good thing was that place was three meters away from the surface, so no one was affected by the lava splashing.\u300cEveryone, get into formation!\u300dHyun shouted through the party chat window.Because they were all skillful, everyone reacted quickly.Jini went to the front and faced Betty.Practice and Ain positioned themselves diagonally.Hyun was at the rear of the party.It was the standard formation while fighting against Betty.Every party member thought that if they didn't lose concentration, they might be able to kill Betty.\"Good. Everyone, check your position! Don't overdo yourselves!\"While following Hyun's orders, the party kept slashing Betty's HP.Hyun lured it, then Jini and Practice locked it, and finally, Ain was in charge of dealing damage.As time went on, the party members became expectant of victory rather than being scared.\"Kaaa! What a... Bothersome... I'll send you all flying...!\"From time to time, Betty changed the attack pattern.As Betty spread her wings, a huge whirlwind rose around her.It was a hurricane that ravaged the underground city!The wind scattered the wreckage from buildings and droplets of lava.The whirlwind was so strong that it could easily blow away a human.If they remained still, they'd be blown away and fall into the lava.\"Jini!\"\"I know!\"But Hyun was also expecting that attack pattern.Jini used \u00abBind\u00bb on the entire party and locked them to the ground.Even a strong wind wouldn't be able to scatter away the party members that had been tied with each other.Whish-!Suddenly, Betty's tail appeared sideways behind Hyun.It was a surprise attack!But even in the middle of that strong wind, Hyun had looked closely at Betty's movements.There were no weak points in a focused Hyun.Crash! Crash! Crash!Five pillars of the building fell like domino pieces.Even while fighting, Hyun didn't fail to notice the slowly tilting ceiling.\"Everyone, dodge!\"As Hyun shouted, Ain and Practice, who had been about to approach, flinched.Boom!A chandelier made of heavy metal fell over Betty.One of the pillars that sustained one side of the building had been destroyed, and with that, the ceiling had collapsed.[You've used the terrain or a structure to deal 91,285 damage to the enemy!]Perhaps it was thanks to Hyun's warning, but no one was swept away by the collapse of the ceiling.The floor was sinking into the lava because of the impact generated by the ceiling falling, so the party quickly fled the place.Practice who was looking at where Betty was, spoke to Hyun in a low voice.\"Is it dead...?\"\"Not yet.\"Rattle, Rattle-\u00a0The giant rocks began moving, then, Betty suddenly rose from the lava.They could see the HP bar on top of its head.It had 30% of HP left.Kaaaa!Betty angrily cried and rushed toward them.Its movements had gotten faster because it didn't have that much HP left.It began attacking the rear more, and the whirlwind also go stronger.But that didn't surprise the party.If they followed Hyun's strategy, the way of dealing with Betty wasn't different, even if it had gotten faster.While fighting, Practice even had time to think about something.'Amazing.'He couldn't believe what was happening.They weren't even level 100; yet they were about to hunt down a named boss monster over level 200.'How is this even possible?'He tried to analyze the current situation from a professional gamer's point of view.Why they were able to hunt Betty\u2026It was thanks to Hyun's strategy and Ain's unbelievable damage output.'Without those two, it would've been impossible.'Maybe they could replace Ain's damage dealing\u2026But there wasn't any user that could replace Hyun.The \u00abAssimilation\u00bb skill was incredible, but what was even more amazing was how Hyun used it.Even if someone else was given that skill, how many users could use it the way he did?First, he was sure he wouldn't be able to do it.Maybe he could catch up in regards to reaction, but Hyun's ability to analyze the situation and basic moves were on another level.Those were things that he needed to work on.\"Good, everyone, keep focused until the end!\"The same battle format went on for a few minutes.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The good thing was that Betty wasn't particularly smart, so it didn't have many attack patterns.Maybe it would work with a group of average users, but Hyun had gone there with the perfect strategy to counter all of its movements.And that long battle was finally reaching the end.'This is the last!'Whish-!The moment the tail hit the air\u2026!Jini's \u00abRestraint\u00bb, Practice's stun, and Ain's flames poured over her.\"We got it!\"As Ain shouted, Betty's health bar reached 0.* * *One of Asrian's developers, Robert, looked at Hyun's gameplay.Robert watched the screen with sweat on his hands.He was amazed by the strategy Hyun was using to deal with the named boss.While monitoring, something unexpected happened.'Wait, what?!'The developers could check all the progress of relationships inside the game at a glance.Just before Hyun's party was about to beat Betty, the system screen turned red.That meant that a transcendent had gotten closer. It was something that only appeared on the developer's screen.'Why so suddenly? What's happening?'Robert began analyzing the logs.Shortly after that, he got a grasp of the situation.Asrian, by itself, was like a separate independent world on its own.The normal relationships were crumbling, and a new event had been born.The incidents related to the Seed of Evil had completely changed.'Why so suddenly...?'The reason seemed to be the involvement of a transcendent, but he couldn't get a detailed explanation.Mari, after seeing Robert tilting his head, asked.\"Is there a bug?\"Robert had been monitoring one user recently.That user was the one with the ID \u2018Hyun\u2019.He was the first user who was able to change the story's flow, so it was normal for the developers to be interested in him.Analyzing his movements made him realize something:The Great Demon of Deception, Keidrial had a huge interest in him!\"A transcendent got involved.\"From the beginning, Keidrial was looking out for Hyun's movements.But that was the first time she'd gotten directly involved.\"Is it normal for a transcendent to be so interested in a particular user?\"At Robert's question, Mari asked.\"What are you talking about?\"\"It's just like I've said. There's a demon that has a great interest in the user Hyun.\"\"Well, demons are also AIs with free will, so it isn't impossible, I guess!\"\"Mari, look at this.\"Robert put something on the screen.It was data that analyzed Keidrial's movements since the servers had opened.Surprisingly, the traces of Hyun and Keidrial matched.The graph traces showed not only the physical path of the characters, but also their interest in certain objects, areas, or even a person. It added thsy interest and showed it as a number.\"Wow, the interests of both are almost the same!\"\"See? You can't say that this is just a coincidence, right?\"\"Of course! It's almost as if she was a stalker!\"The graph only showed the result of the relationship. It didn't show the details.Even Robert, one of Asrian's developers, didn't know everything about what was happening.Why was a Great Demon so interested in a particular user?He felt he'd have to watch a little bit more closely to know the answer to that question.After all, the quest hadn't ended yet.* * *At the same time\u2026Something special happened to Mayday, the user placed 2nd in the Hall of Fame, a member of the Darkness Guild.'This...'Mayday was surprised.While walking through the plaza, the people surrounding her had suddenly disappeared.The world turned red, and the sun had become black.She was suddenly left alone in an unknown world.'I'm not dreaming...!'She had become the second user in Asrian to enter the 'Symmetrical World.'At first, she thought it was a bug.Mayday tried many things, such as the Guild's chatting window, but everything was working just okay.\u300cOh, Mayday? Are you okay?!\u300d\u300cMayday, why did you suddenly disappear while hunting?\u300d\u300cI'm also not sure why...\u300dMayday answered the Guild's chat window while looking around.She was on top of endless stairs rather than on the streets of a big city.A road to the sky\u2026On the edge of it, there was an endless cliff.'Where am I...?'Mayday thought she'd been teleported to somewhere.\u2026But she couldn't guess where she was.She felt as if she'd been sent to another world\u2014it didn't look like any place in Asrian she'd been to.After a short while, she got a quest message.[Hidden Quest: Devil's Deal]- The Great Demon of Deception wants to borrow your soul.- To accept the quest, walk along the road.'What?!'Mayday took a deep breath.She was surprised because of a word that appeared in the quest.Great Demon.Wasn't it the strongest transcendents?Even though her heart was beating fast, she got immersed in deep thought.She couldn't understand why she'd gotten that quest.\u300cMayday, are you okay?\u300d\u300cSo this means you can't return?\u300d\u300cIt... Seems like I've received a huge quest. It says Great Demon's Hidden Quest.\u300d\u300cWhat?

She was with another two party members.'I can't win!'Mayday's face became pale because she thought she'd have no chance of winning that fight.Not only that, but there didn't seem to be a way to cancel the quest.She was happy when she received her first hidden quest, but this wasn't what she wanted.The moment she was thinking that, she got another system message.[The Demon of Deception knows that you're worthless.

So this should be the bare minimum!'She didn't understand how exactly it worked, but it seemed like, thanks to the demon's power, she was able to possess a monster named Betty.Among hidden quests, there were some like this that had a special event, so it wasn't that weird.Mayday had a smile on her face while looking at Ain.'Yes, if it's like this...

Rather than that, it was emitting dark energy while standing still.Even Hyun couldn't understand what was happening.'Why hasn't it died?'Betty, whose HP was at 0, didn't seem either alive or dead.The party members were watching it anxiously from a distance.Suddenly, Mayday appeared behind Betty.'What?'Hyun's eyes widened after seeing who had suddenly appeared.'Mayday...?!'She was currently 2nd in the rankings and was Darkness's strongest Magician.Hyun remembered all the information about the Hall of Fame rankers, so she knew it was Mayday when she saw her.'Why is she here\u2026?'Hyun suddenly started to feel uneasy.They were currently doing a Heaven's Quest.On the other hand, it was widely known that Mayday was part of the forces of the Abyss.Hyun suddenly thought about a possibility.'No way, did we get overlapping quests?!'Because the forces of Heaven and Abyss were fighting against each other, from time to time, some overlapping quests appeared.It was similar to what happened during the Count's Quest.If Mayday had received a quest that overlapped with the Knight Commander's quest, it wasn't weird that they got to face each other.Paf- Mayday's body suddenly scattered away and entered Betty's body.\"Wait, that skill!\"Hyun was so surprised that he shouted using Ain's voice.It was a skill effect he'd seen hundreds of times.It was his ultimate attack.Mayday had suddenly \u00abAssimilated\u00bb into Betty.\"Isn't that the skill you use, \u00abAssimilation\u00bb...?\"Among the party members, it was Ain who noticed the skill's identity the first.Because she'd been the target of the skill, she identified the effects of the skill.It seemed like the members of Stardust didn't understand the gravity of the situation yet.\"Hyun, what's happening?

The impact of Betty's claws shook his entire body.'Ugh, heavy...!'Practice started feeling powerless.The moment the claws hit his shield, he was pushed back.Receiving consecutive attacks from someone with more than 200 stats in Strength and Agility\u2026!He tried to resist while clenching his teeth, but he couldn't come to his senses because of the effect of the impact.Paf-!When a lot of damage had accumulated, Mayday disappeared.\u300cFrom behind, dodge!\u300dBy the moment Hyun shouted, Mayday's tail had already hit Practice from behind.It was Betty's skill, \u00abRear Leap\u00bb.Mayday had immobilized Practice with a normal hit and then used the boss's skill.Boom-!There was a huge explosion in the air.Hyun tried to use \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb on Practice, but it was useless in the face of immeasurable damage.[You've received 103,928 damage!][You've died!][You'll be able to log in again in 48 hours!]Practice's body became light and exploded in the air before vanishing.\u00ffIt was a series of consecutive attacks that targeted the opponent's psychology.It was a technique that would get anyone if it were their first time facing something like it.After killing Practice with one hit, Mayday smiled.'At last\u2026 I landed an attack!'The destructive power of a named boss was more lethal than imagined.It was true that she'd borrowed the strength of the quest, but she couldn't believe that she was able to use such overwhelming specs with her own will!The current situation made her smile.'This is the worst.'On the other hand, Hyun clenched his teeth.Originally, Betty was a low-IQ monster.The reason why it had a ridiculously strong skill was to cover its low IQ.But what would happen if a user controlled Betty?That would mean that a boss capable of breaking the game's balance had appeared.Even if the one controlling the boss were an average user, it would make things more difficult. But the opponent was the person ranked 2nd in the Hall of Fame.What should he do to overcome the difference in specs?He couldn't think of an answer.\"I'm almost out of mana!\"To make things worse, Ain shouted that.Anyone would panic under such circumstances, but rather than giving up, Hyun clenched his fists.Among all the strategies he'd thought of, there was one in which he took into consideration the worst possible outcome.Back then, he wasn't expecting something like that to happen, but it wasn't like he was out of options.Hyun quickly shouted.\u300cJini, use all your buffs on me... No, I mean Ain!\u300d\"Understood!\"Whir- A purple light came out from Jini's wand and covered Ain's body.\u00abRetrogression\u00bb.It was the Priest's ultimate attack\u2014it made an ally\u2019s body return to the state it was 10 minutes before.It couldn't modify the cooldown time of skills, but it could change the amount of HP and Mana left.Soon, Ain's mana was replenished.\"Use all the other buffs too! Quickly!\"Jini felt a little bit of chill after looking at Hyun's eyes.Up until then, it didn't matter how hard the situation was. He had always remained calm. But right then, he was different.Wouldn't the face of a general in a battle where one couldn't see the next step look like that?Jini took a deep breath and used all her buff skills.\u00abIncrease HP\u00bb, \u00abNatural Healing Power Boost\u00bb, \u00abMana Regeneration Boost\u00bb, \u00abIncrease Critical Hit Chance\u00bb... Luxurious effects kept shining one after the other.\"Hyun, you need to give me a call later on. Okay?!\"After Jini shouted, Mayday's body disappeared.The Priest could become very annoying if left alive, so it was normal for her to become the next target.Boom-!As the monster's tail crushed Jini, she became light and was devoured by the death effect.[You've received 138,472 damage!][You've died! You will be able to log in again in 48 hours!]There was an explosion in the air, and Jini scattered into light as well.\u2026But it wasn't time to care about her death.\u300cAin, use the ultimate attack!\u300d\"I was getting ready...!\"Ain, who was waiting for Hyun's orders, nodded.Giant flames devoured her entire body.Fwoosh-! Ears and tails made of fire appeared.It was the form of an incarnated wolf that tripled the damage of all fire attacks.Crack-!As Ain activated a Magic, claws that were over one meter long appeared on her hands.In Hyun and Ain's ultimate attack, there was an effect that increased skill levels by one each.Support, Close Range Magician\u2026If both ultimate attacks were activated, the \u00abFlame Claws\u00bb became level 7 and evolved to \u00abEfreet's Claw\u00bb.That was how Ain looked after Hyun and she had used all their skills.And it was how they were going to deal with Mayday, who was controlling the boss's body.Hyun opened the status window.After activating her ultimate attack, Ain's HP went down little by little.\u300cWe have to finish this as soon as possible.\u300dAs the situation became more dangerous, Hyun's head became colder.An incredible amount of possible strategies came to his mind and disappeared.Among an endless amount of possibilities, Hyun found one possible solution.It was a risky strategy, but right then, they had no other way than try it.\u300cYou just focus on dodging the tail.\u300d\"The tail? But it's faster than my reaction speed.\"\u300cYou still have to do it.\u300d\"I may make a mistake...\"\u300cI won't blame you, don't worry.\u300d\"Then I'll just put my trust in Hyun...\"Ain took a deep breath.How you avoided being hit from an attack you couldn't dodge was by moving in an unpredictable way.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Ain stepped on the city building's roofs very quickly.She kept moving erratically... The moment Mayday disappeared, she jumped!Paf-! The tail brushed her foot.As the wind whip exploded the air, the buildings around there became ash.'I dodged it!'Ain stepped on a spire-shaped roof near there and got her balance.The fact that she had dodged it once didn't mean there wasn't any more danger.It was different from an AI that gave you some time to relax.The opponent was a human being.\u2014She kept attacking without giving her time to rest.Ain changed direction again after Betty's figure disappeared.Whish-!The tail moved through the air while making a sonic boom.The instant death-inducing whip passed over Ain's chest.She hadn't been hit, even though her movements had been a little bit slower because she hadn't remained still.Her claws, tail, and rocks had barely torn apart some clothes.Mayday couldn't hide her surprise at Ain's movements.Even though she was attacking at speed one couldn't possibly fathom reacting to... She wasn't able to land an attack.After backing off a little bit, Mayday opened her mouth for the first time.\"Wonderful movements. I can't believe you're able to dodge this.\"While being \u00abAssimilated\u00bb to Betty, her voice sounded grotesque, as if a demon was speaking.\"But\u2026 you know what?\"Just like that time, she felt a wall. But unlike back then, she wasn't feeling despair.There was no need for that.Up until then, she'd just used the skills of the boss. She hadn't used any of her skills.\"I have a new job. I'm now a Psychokinesis Sorcerer.\"As Mayday moved her hand, the rock pieces scattered away in the lava city began floating in the air.Tens of rock pieces soon became hundreds; then they surrounded Ain.\"You won't be able to dodge all this!\"The moment Mayday closed her fist, all of the rock pieces attacked her simultaneously.There was no way she'd be able to dodge it all!Hyun immediately used his \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb.Tap Tap Tap- As all the rocks hit Ain's body and bounced away, Mayday's eyebrows twitched.'She didn't take damage?'Even back then, from time to time, Ain showed a ridiculous defense that defied common sense.What skill was that?She didn't know the details of it, but she was sure she wouldn't be able to block every single attack.'It's okay. I'm sure at least one will be able to damage her!'Mayday knew that it wasn't a fair fight.Her specs had received a huge buff thanks to the Great Demon's Quest.It was obvious that she was going to win, but just winning had no meaning.It wasn't time to get desperate for victory.She had to find Ain's weak point.If she'd faced her with her regular specs, the fight would've ended without her being able to try all this.Mayday started to use her psychokinesis.Whap-!Suddenly, Ain's attack came flying toward Mayday.\u2014It was the giant Efreet's Claw that was about to smash her.But Ain's claw suddenly stopped mid-air.It was thanks to a skill Mayday had activated.'It isn't moving...?!'Ain felt like a transparent rope was blocking her.\u00abAir Restraint\u00bb.It was a skill of the Psychokinesis Sorcerer that blocked weak or light things.\"Ugh...\"Ain quickly backed off.She immediately charged again.She tried to smash her again, but her movement was blocked once more.She had been restrained by the same skill again.Mayday smiled after seeing Ain having trouble landing attacks on her.'Does this work...?'Yes, even if not every single attack worked on her, she just had to find the ones that did.The truth was that Mayday had chosen to become a Psychokinesis Sorcerer because of Ain.She was sure Ain's job was related to Magician.Wouldn't a Magician with low strength and close-range skills be weak to psychokinetic attacks?Mayday's guess was correct.Although \u00abEfreet's Claw\u00bb looked giant and grotesque, it had no weight.Basically, it was easy food for her.'Good, I've found a skill that works on her!'Mayday became excited.She decided to slowly search for an opportunity.Both claws intertwined.Ain's fight with Mayday looked like a match between two monsters.But unlike what it looked like from the outside, it wasn't a brute, mindless fight.On every single attack, there were lots of mind games involved.Whish- Mayday once again used the \u00abRear Leap\u00bb.It was the attack that took out Practice!Ain tried to jump again, but right then, Mayday had another card.The moment Ain jumped, she tied her up with psychokinesis.\"Oof, you shouldn't carelessly jump like that!\"Mayday smiled while seeing Ain struggle in the air.A Magician with low strength had no way to free herself from psychokinetic attacks.No, maybe some Magicians had skills that allowed them to do that, but that didn't seem to be Ain's case.\"Will you be able to dodge while being tied in the air?\"After locking Ain in the air, Mayday raised her claws.A Close-Range Magician that had a weak body would probably die instantly after receiving Betty's attack.The moment death was approaching her\u2026Even Ain dripped with a cold sweat.\"Hyun, I might really die!\"\u300cIt's okay.\u300dWhish-! Mayday's claws scratched the air.\u300cI'll move from now on.\u300dThe reason why Mayday's attack failed was that Hyun had taken control of the body and used a skill.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 - An Unforeseen Occurrence (3)\u300cPsychokinesis... It seems like she really thought about it.\u300dHyun smiled.While Ain was struggling with facing Mayday, Hyun was thinking of a way to beat her.In the previous game, there were also many jobs related to Psychokinesis, and there were also many ways to counter them.The solution Hyun thought of involved a skill he'd seen during the awakening quests.[\u00abWind Barrier\u00bb Lv.0]- You can create a wind barrier in any place within 10 meters.- The higher the skill level is, the thicker the barrier becomes.What's the most effective way to face a monster that flies?That's when he thought of using the skill, \u00abWind Barrier\u00bb.When he reached that conclusion, he used skill points.It wasn't weird that, in the Support's skill tree, there was a skill that the Close-Range Magician also had.It wasn't weird for different jobs to have skills in common.\"Isn't she acting weird?\" Ain mumbled in a low voice.\"She suddenly isn't using the boss's skill.\"She correctly analyzed Mayday psychologically.She wasn't using any dangerous skills to obtain as much information about Ain as possible.Because she had so much battle experience, she saw through Mayday's passive strategy.\"It seems like she isn't properly attacking on purpose.\"\u300cI also felt that. It seems like she wants to see our cards... It would be better if we hid as much as we can.\u300dHyun smiled.\u300cEven so, we have no intention of losing. Right?\u300dHyun approached Mayday.Whir- He felt like his body was trapped by a spider web.\u00abAir Restraint\u00bb.Thanks to that skill, Ain hadn't been able to get close to Mayday.But things had changed.Hyun placed a \u00abWind Barrier\u00bb behind her.At the same time, he stepped on the air and leaped forward.'What...?!'Mayday was surprised after seeing Ain use some kind of boost in the air and reduce the distance between them.Because the \u00abWind Barrier\u00bb was half-transparent, Mayday didn't realize what was going on.She couldn't understand how Ain had beat her psychokinesis.Because she didn't understand what was happening, the moment Ain charged toward her, she extended her hands again.'Ah...!'That time, she saw it!She was stepping on something that was in the air!\u00abAir Restraint\u00bb was a skill that could stop light things, but the moment the thing you had restrained began moving fast, the target could easily break free from the skill.'This doesn't work?'Fwoosh-Mayday's eyes widened after seeing the flames approach.A pair of claws were reflected on her eyes pupils.The moment she inhaled, she received tens of flame attacks!Now that she had the speed boost that the Priest gave her and even the buff of the Support, the damage output of the Close-Range Magician was beyond imagination.[Critical Hit! You've received 19,382 damage!][Critical Hit! You've received 19,915 damage!]She received consecutive attacks.Mayday was surprised after seeing Betty's HP, which was over two million, go down very fast.'What's up with this damage?!'The HP had gone down by more than a hundred thousand.Because she had more HP than before, she could experience firsthand the destructive power of the claws.Mayday quickly flew away.She wanted to get away from Ain's attacks.Tap. Tap.Since she was in his attack range, Hyun had no intentions of letting her go.He made a foothold in the air and approached Mayday while moving in a zigzag pattern.Suddenly, the only thing above him was the ceiling.The entire lava city was under him.\u300cWe don't have a lot of time left. You know that, right?\u300d\"Yes, I know...!\"Because Ain's ultimate attack consumed HP, they couldn't drag the fight too much.Ain was more used to frenetically fighting against an opponent, so he decided to leave things to her.He just placed Wind Barriers so she could use them as a bridge.\u300cAll right, go on a rampage!\u300dAir battle\u2026In the sky, a human and a bird intertwined.No, you couldn't call Mayday\u2019s form that looked like a bat a bird.The fact that the \u00abWind Barrier\u00bb skill had become the key to making the strategy successful didn't change.The flow of the battle changed.Mayday, rather than surprised, was horrified.She couldn't believe that a user that couldn't fly could follow a boss that could do it in such ways!Ain, from time to time, used the ceiling as a stepping stone and turned her body over.The one responsible for those movements was Hyun, of course.The reason why Hyun was in charge of moving was that he had to use the \u00abWind Barrier\u00bb skill to create a path.Ain was in charge of attacking.At first, legs and arms moving each on their own sounded ridiculous.\u2014Because a human's body moves in complex harmony.But if you could read each other's thoughts, something like that became possible.'How long is she going to follow me for?!'Mayday was stunned by Ain's movements that reminded her of a stuntman.The weak point of a user was that they weren't used to the movements of a flying being.In real life, no human had wings.Mayday, who was 2nd in the rankings, was no exception.Maybe the real 'Betty' would've been able to leave Hyun behind, but Mayday was a human.Her first mistake was choosing to fly to get away from them.The two million HP kept going down.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafy* * *The claws that were over one meter long overwhelmed Betty thanks to their attack range.Because the opponent constantly reduced the distance between them, she interfered with her casting, so she wasn't able to use \u00abRear Leap\u00bb.Just then, she'd tried to use that skill twice, but a critical hit had canceled the skill activation.To make things worse, they were a hundred meters over the air.Even if she created a whirlwind on the surface, the wind wouldn't be able to reach where they were fighting.'Yes, maybe going down is a better idea... Coff?!'It was at that moment\u2026Mayday suddenly felt suffocated.Ain had taken the opportunity and used her claws to grab Mayday.\u300cWell done, Ain!\u300dWhir-Hyun made a platform that was parallel to the ground.He kicked it while upside down and jumped.Towards the ground, faster than falling down!Platforms that connected the sky and surface vertically appeared and then disappeared.The purpose of those was to increase the speed at which they fell.The speed was so fast that Betty's wings couldn't resist the inertia.'What...!'[Critical Hit! You've received 20,382 damage!][Critical Hit! You've received 19,937 damage!]Even while falling, she kept receiving damage from the fire claws.An ominous premonition flashed through Mayday's mind.'Don't tell me... Am I going to die?'Boom-!Mayday fell vertically onto the roof of a building.Just as if a meteorite had fallen, piles of rocks were scattered in all directions.Because Betty and Ain both had high Agility stats, the damage received wasn't that big, but she couldn't block the abnormal status generated from the impact.[A great impact has shaken your head!][For 10 seconds, you won't be able to recover from fainting!]Mayday's head was upside down; her mind was blown away.Immediately, Ain's claws began scratching the unconscious Mayday's body.\u2014All attacks ended up in a critical hit.'No way, am I really going to lose?'Mayday's HP, which only had 1/4 of the starting amount, soon bottomed out.It was truly an extreme amount of damage.Mayday was feeling chill at sight. It was so overwhelming that she couldn't tell who the named boss really was.[You've lost all your HP! The \u00abAssimilation\u00bb has been canceled!][You weren't able to resist for even 10 minutes! The Great Demon of Deception is disappointed in you!][You didn't receive any reward!]While Mayday was astonished, her HP reached 0. She soon became black energy and scattered away.She was in the middle of the city's square when she opened her eyes again.It was where Mayday had been before accepting the Great Demon's quest.* * *A few hours after she was unexpectedly defeated by Ain\u2026It was possible that the news of the Guild's strongest member, Mayday, losing would cause a great commotion.That's why Mayday decided to show the recording to only the most important Darkness members.Nobody could hide their surprise.'What skill is it...?'XL, who was watching the video, suddenly stood up.The reason was that he had felt a very strong chill.Ain was using the skill she'd used during the Count's Quest of her own free will.Those claws that dealt an unbelievable amount of damage!XL had thought that skill was something exclusive to that quest.After all, on all the videos on Reddit about Ain, she had never used that skill, so it was normal that he had concluded that.'So that wasn't a temporary skill that she received thanks to the help of a quest?'All his guesses shattered away.A transformation skill that had an incredibly destructive power\u2026That was probably an Awakening Skill.'What grade awakening skill is it? Don't tell me it's over four\u2026'After incorporating a few Asra Online users, members of Darkness had learned about the Awakening Quests.According to what they said in Asrian Online, the difficulty of those quests had increased a lot.In the previous game, a few users had been able to clear the 4th Awakening Quest Trial. But in Asra, there didn't seem to be a single user who had successfully managed to do it.In the communities, some users had said they'd been able to clear the 4th Trial, but some further investigations had revealed that they were lying.'What kind of damage\u2026?'The sight of a million HP going down was unbelievable.Mayday had \u00abAssimilated\u00bb into a monster named Betty.According to the information they'd been able to get, it was a level 235 named boss.Ain's attack was high enough to penetrate the defense of the boss monster.Ain was able to deal such incredible damage thanks to Hyun's skill that lowered the opponent's defense, but there was no way the members of Darkness would know about it.'Did she clear the 5th Trial...?'If it's an Ultimate Attack like that, couldn't it be possible that she'd successfully managed to clear the 5th Trial?That was the only possible explanation for that mind-blowing amount of damage.Some of the people watching the footage laughed in disbelief.They couldn't believe that it was from the same game they were playing.But the reason why they were all so confused was that they didn't know about Hyun, who had \u00abAssimilated\u00bb into Ain while fighting against Mayday.To know about the extra stats that \u00abAssimilation\u00bb gave and the \u00abPowerless Wave\u00bb that lowered the opponent's defense, they had to read the status window, but there was no way to do that.\"If it's such a balance-breaking Ultimate Attack, it probably has a weakness. It may have a very long cool-down time\u2026 Or maybe it lowers your level each time you use it.\"\"We can't make any conclusions. We have to think and be prepared for the worst possibility. We don't know when we'll have to fight her again.\"\"Ugh... I can't make a proper guess because we have no information!\"XL opened his mouth after all the important members had given their thoughts.XL spoke with a serious tone.\"Let's incorporate an Asra Online ranker.\"\"What? A ranker?\"XL answered Reina's question.\"Ain was also a ranker on the previous game, right? Maybe a fellow ranker knows more about her. Right? Maybe that person will have more information about the Ultimate Attack Ain is using.\"Given the circumstances, XL's opinion was the most reasonable.But there was only one problem\u2026\"But where are we going to find a ranker?\"Fu- XL laughed at Mayday's question.Finding users and operating the Guild was the thing he was the most confident about.\"These past few days, I've been thinking about expanding operations. We're going to have no problem in regards to incorporating new members.\"After looking at XL's smile, everyone reached the same conclusion.\u2014Their leader had already finished not only the preparations, but he had already put his plan into action.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But it looks like a diamond.\"As if she was possessed, Ain walked toward the giant jewel and touched it.At that moment\u2026Everything that surrounded them scattered away and disappeared.Hyun shouted in surprise.\"Huh? Ain? Where are you?!\"Hyun tried to grab Ain's hands, which were disappearing, but there was only air.\"Wait, is this\u2026 A video?\"For a moment, he thought that an accident had occurred, but soon, he discovered that there was the scene of an event being reproduced in front of him.After learning about his mistake, Hyun felt relieved.'I see.

But I don't remember that name among the list of Royal Angels\u2026'Hyun frowned while trying to remember.In Asra, there wasn't anyone called Louise, so maybe that meant that the world was different from before.But Hyun saw something else that surprised him even more.The Heaven's area where Louise was started to become crimson.And then\u2026 the Sun turned off.No, more than turning off, it started to emit black energy.The Abyss had devoured an important part of the Heavens.Suddenly, the most sinister creature in existence was standing in front of Louise.\u2014A being with giant horns and a pair of wings that were redder than the blood.'A demon\u2026?'The moment the demon turned her face around, its face flashed past the screen.Hyun didn't miss that moment.'That's Keidrial!'* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Even though her face appeared for only a few seconds, Hyun recognized it.She was the one that had made him choose the Support job.She was one of the demons with the highest rank in the Abyss, so there was no way he wouldn't remember her face.Keidrial approached Louise. The little Louise recoiled and was pale.Maybe her legs were loose, but Louise slumped down.'This isn't good\u2026'Hyun didn't notice that his heart was beating faster than when he was facing Mayday.\u2014That's how focused he was on the video.Keidrial extended her hands and grabbed Louise's little head.Intense, dark energy entered her.'Ugh\u2026!'Kyaaaaaa-!An eardrum-piercing scream echoed through the place where light and darkness were mixed together.It was more horrifying because it didn't sound like a human's scream.Keidrial looked down at Louise, who was in pain.But that lasted only for a few moments.Louise's wings, which were made of crystals, drooped.When Keidrial withdrew her hands, Louise's eyes were out of focus, and from her body, black energy that resembled that of a demon\u2019s emerged.'Is Louise\u2026 Okay?'Paf- A portal opened from behind.Keidrial dragged Louise and disappeared after entering the portal.The crimson-dyed Heavens returned to white, and the event video ended.\"\u2026\"Even after the video ended, Hyun kept staring blankly at the air for a while.\"Hyun.\"\"\u2026\"\"Are you okay?\"He came back to his senses only after Ain had called out to him many times.\"Huh\u2026? Yes, I'm okay.\"\"Did you see the video? I couldn't understand what was happening,\" Ain asked him with narrow eyes.\"Hyun, it seems like you know something.\"\"Yes, but I'm not sure\u2026\" Hyun said while shooking his head.\"I'll tell you once I organize my thoughts.\"The big jewel Ain touched had turned black.On top of the jewel that had lost its shine, there was an old necklace.Hyun frowned.\"Wait, why is this here\u2026\"\"You know it?\"\"Probably\u2026\"Usually, he wouldn't have known what it was, but after looking at footage related to Louise, he immediately recognized it.He approached it and grabbed it.After looking at it closely, he became sure of it.That's right\u2026 That was the necklace she had worn.It was the necklace she cherished so much.'It's definitely that.'He was sure she wouldn't throw away an item she cared so much about.Then why was that necklace there?He opened the information window after picking it up.[Shabby Necklace]- It's a necklace that has an evil pattern. You shouldn't expect it to have a special effect. Maybe you could sell the gold decorations it has and receive some money?Even though it didn't mention Louise's name, Hyun was sure the necklace belonged to her.Then, he suddenly got a system message.[The main quest, 'In Search of Louise,' has been updated!]Hyun rapidly opened his status window.There were two new lines in the main quest he'd received before.- You've obtained an item that's registered somewhere.- Maybe it could become a hint?'A hint\u2026?'The new sentences that were added weren't very helpful.'What's going on\u2026''Hyun, it seems like you like that necklace?'Hyun was thinking, he heard Ain's voice.\"Me?\"\"You're holding it tight even now.\"Hyun had been standing still for a while with the necklace clutched in his hand.Ain was thinking about something deeply while looking at Hyun.A teleportation circle appeared on the floor.[In 10 seconds, you'll be teleported to the dungeon's entrance. To cancel it, please move more than a meter.]As the countdown approached 0, many thoughts crossed Hyun's mind.* * *\"Did you guys really find the 'Evil's Seed' in just one day? That's incredible! Even if it were me, I wouldn't have been able to reach the dungeon's end in one day!\"[The Knight's Commander's affection rate has increased a lot!][If you have his trust, all the other people in the Empire will trust you, too!][You've obtained rewards!]- Heaven's Medal of Honor x 10- Bonus skill points + 10\"Haha, if you have no requests, come to see me! You're always more than welcome!\"Hyun and Ain, who had finished their work, walked the long corridor and left the top floor.Even while giving the report about the quest, Hyun was still thinking about the footage related to Louise.What was the meaning of the things he saw?What was Louise's relationship with the demons?What was the use of the necklace?Lots of thoughts were lingering around his head.He felt that his head would be a mess for the entire day.He couldn't forget the sight of Louise screaming because of pain.The thing that made Hyun come back to his senses was a sudden question Ain asked him.\"Aren't you going to try the cloth?\"\"Huh\u2026? What?\"\"The item that the boss dropped,\" Ain answered.Hyun had a habit of examining in detail if he got a useful item while playing.But even though they'd obtained an item after defeating a level 235 boss, he hadn't checked it yet.That was something weird for Hyun to do.\"Oh yeah, the item.\"After hearing Ain's words, Hyun remembered the new item.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had obtained it after defeating Mayday, who had been \u00abAssimilated\u00bb to a named boss.Support, \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, Empathy\u2026He wasn't sure how the three things were connected, but he didn't think that it was a coincidence that the requirement to wear it was having Empathy.\"Hyun, you're... Not going to throw away the equipment you're wearing now. Right?\"\"Hmm? Do you want it? Oh, that's right. My equipment has Magic embedded in it! I don't have a use for it anymore, so do you want it?\" Hyun answered at Ain's mumble.\"Th-then shall I use it...?\"Because Hyun was so concentrated on analyzing the new item, he didn't see the corners of Ain's mouth going up.Among the items description, the last part caught his attention the most.'Raise the level of \u00abPray\u00bb?'According to the description, once he reached level 6 of \u00abPray\u00bb, the item would unlock new abilities.Although it was troublesome, he had to do it.It was the first unique robe he had obtained. Not only that, but he had received it after defeating a level 235 named boss!Not only that, but items with restrictions often had a special ability.Even if unlocking an item was bothersome, it was something that had to be done.'I must go up two more levels.'Thankfully, fulfilling the pre-requisite wasn't a hard task.Hyun had raised the level of \u00abPray\u00bb whenever he had free time. Thanks to that, it was currently at level 4. Not only that, but the proficiency bar was half-filled.'Okay, let's do this.'Hyun went to the temple that was nearest to the Empire.He remembered a chapel where you could raise the level of \u00abPray\u00bb quickly.It wasn't a lie that the Empire had a history of hundreds of years. The chapel was full of people praying until late hours.Hyun also closed his eyes and began praying.But why was it?It didn't matter how much he concentrated\u2014he felt that the proficiency bar wasn't increasing.No, he felt it was increasing slower than when he was praying alone while lying on the square bench.'Was it always this slow...?'There was no progress.Hyun tried to remember the teachings he received in the Twilight Temple.Praying was the act of feeling empathy with the will of a Transcendent\u2026That's right, Transcendent... He had to feel the presence of a Transcendent.'Wait, if Louise is an angel... Then she's also a Transcendent?'At that moment, Hyun became surprised.The progress rate had changed.'What happened?'He looked at the skill window once more.He felt that the proficiency bar had gone up a lot after thinking about Louise.It was an incredible result considering that, during 10 minutes, there hadn't been a change in proficiency.'Is Louise... Related to the proficiency of praying?!'From that moment, Hyun began praying while thinking about Louise.He remembered that day, before the patch, the incidents that happened five years before, and lowered his consciousness.Hyun emptied his thoughts and went to the state your mind is just before you go to sleep, and then he felt that his mind was being filled with the feelings of someone else.The sensation of feeling someone else's feelings was similar to that day.But unlike the ones he felt that day, they were of a different kind.Back then, he felt fear and frustration. But this time, he could feel sadness and a deep longing for what was past.Was it because of Empathy? Hyun was so immersed in praying that he couldn't feel time flow.In just an instant, the proficiency bar was almost half-full.Hyun didn't notice that he had shed some tears while praying.That was because the system immediately erased a user's tears, unlike those of an NPC\u2019s.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Two days were short, but it was too much time for a gamer that played Asrian.It was especially longer for players that had received a penalty for dying.He knew how it felt because he had also experienced it firsthand. So SeoHyun felt sorry for both Stardust members.After all, they had died because of a quest he'd taken them to.Hyun was thinking about what to tell them, but after looking at JaeHoon's expression, he discovered he was worrying about nothing.\"So you ended up killing that bat boss?! You're amazing!\"JaeHoon became excited after hearing that the quest was a success.Because he had died, he hadn't received the achievement bonus for being the first ones to kill Betty, but it seemed like neither member of Stardust cared about that.Hyun smiled after seeing JaeHoon's bright expression.\"There were some dangerous moments... But we got lucky in the end.\"\"Woah, you're amazing. I'll tell it to Jini also. Oh, yeah. She was asking for your contact.\"\"Oh, feel free to share it with her.\"\"Really?\"JaeHoon pressed his smartphone with a smile.He was probably sending a message to Jini.\"Haha... She says thank you.\"SeoHyun scratched his cheeks.The truth was that it had been him who had proposed that they do the hidden quest, so he felt it was his fault that they had died. He wasn't sure what they'd say\u2014that was why he felt weird about them saying thanks.He told that to JaeHoon, and he just laughed.\"Why are you worrying about things like that? No one would complain after receiving 10 free skill points.\"\"Really...?\"If he were asked to choose between 10 skill points and logging in for two days, he would always pick the second option.But what Hyun didn't realize was that his perspective differed from the rest of the users.\"I don't care about dying. These past few days, I've been focusing too much on gaming, so I wanted to take some free time. Even if my job is being a professional gamer, I can't be playing for the entire day. Right?\"JaeHoon just brushed off the incident.That's how the conversation ended.But something unexpected happened when he got home.SeoHyun's eyes widened after reading a message in the capsule.[You've one unread message!]The moment he clicked on it, an unbelievable message unfolded.SeoHyun was so surprised that he couldn't blink for a moment.[You've received $50,000 USD from Jinny77.]'Wh-What! Jinny? Did she really send this...?'The capsules had an option to link bank accounts, so it was possible to send money if you knew the other person's ID.But rather than that, SeoHyun was surprised because of the amount of money.'Seriously, $50,000?!'Surprised, SeoHyun sat down on the floor. He wasn't able to do anything for a while.Judging from the ID, the only person capable of doing something like that was Jini... But he couldn't understand why she'd sent such a huge sum of money.Ting! The notification alarm sounded when SeoHyun couldn't get his act together.[Jinny77 has asked for a 1 on 1 conversation. Will you accept?]'What?!'He reflexively turned his head toward the screen.He could hear Jini's voice from the speaker within the capsule.\"I've heard the news from Practice! So you've cleared the quest?\"\"Jini? That's not the issue here...\"Hyun asked after looking at the amount of money that appeared on his capsule's account.\"What's this? Is this the fee for the classes? Then it's too much!\"\"Oh, that's not the class fee.\"\"Then...?\"\"It's for clearing the hidden quest!\"\"What?!\"\"I've asked my fellow teammates how much they would pay for 10 extra skill points in Asrian Online... Most of them answered a number that was around $50,000 USD. That's why I've sent that to you.\"SeoHyun's head throbbed after listening to Jini's explanation.To be honest, that amount of money frightened him.Was it okay for him to receive such an amount of money?He had indeed played the biggest role, but it wasn't that the rest of the party had done nothing.'We were able to clear the quest because we all did our part.'While fighting against Betty, Ain's Mana had plummeted. If it weren't for Jini's Ultimate Attack, \u00abRetrogression\u00bb, they wouldn't have been able to withstand Betty's attacks.And Practice also kept stunning Betty so that Ain could attack safely.Also, the plan wouldn't have been possible without Ain's high damage output.Everyone had done their part during the quest.But Jini had sent money only to him.It was a huge sum of money.Jini also knew that wasn't a reasonable amount of compensation.Jini also knew her teammates were joking while talking about what the skill points were worth.Despite all that, Jini had decided to do it because she knew the worth of the user Hyun.'I must think well.'From the first moment she met him, Jini had watched Hyun closely.\u2014As a user and as a person.Hyun's mental calculations in stuff related to the game were incredibly fast.That was something easy to see, considering how he thought about and executed creative plans.But it still seemed dull in stuff related to real life.She'd noticed that he didn't realize his own realistic worth.Maybe it was because he was still a freshman and didn't have much real-life experience.Could she take advantage of his lack of experience?She thought that for a short while, but quickly shook her head.That would be penny-wise, pound foolish.The most valuable thing was Hyun himself.Once the game was out of its early stages, he'd soon realize what he's worth.She'd rather not do things that would make him hate her later on.'No, I should rather tell him what his worth is.'She'd decided to send him that money because she wished for the relationship to continue.A one-sided relationship where one kept owing the other part couldn't last long.That's why Jini had decided to clear up her debts.\"Don't worry. I'm sure you will make a lot more money than that in the future.\"\"Me?\"\"Yes.\"\"Also, I still have more money to pay. We haven't decided on the price of the classes.\"\"No, you don't need to...\"\"Hmm, how much should we make it per class... Maybe ten...\"'Ten...? She's obviously not talking about ten dollars, right?'SeoHyun suddenly got nervous.As sums of money he'd never had appeared on his head, he began feeling headaches.To be honest, he still hadn't processed the $50,000 USD Jini had given him.If, on top of that, he received more money for the classes, wouldn't he feel pressured to teach her for the entire day?SeoHyun shook his head.\"No, I don't need more money! It's not like I have something incredible to teach you or anything!\"\"Yeah... I guess you won't have much time either. Although I'm okay with you giving me some tips.\"Jini nodded her head.Maybe he was still feeling overwhelmed, so she decided not to discuss the price of the classes.But she decided she wasn't going to take advantage of his goodwill.Only by having a thoroughly calculated deal would she be able to keep having a relationship with him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 - Realizing his worth (2)\"I'll contact you again when I'm able to log in.\"What Jini did shook Hyun.\u2014It made him think a lot.He couldn't concentrate on gaming at all. Sometimes, his heart sank for no apparent reason.But slowly, he started to stabilize.'Yes, Asrian is different from Asra\u2014a game no one played.'After reaching that conclusion, Hyun began checking out some item marketplace websites.Items he thought were worthless were selling for huge sums of money.He learned the position an Asrian ranker had a little bit.Of course, as time went on, the price of gold would drop because of inflation, and that would make the price of items fall.Maybe the items he had were worth tens... No hundreds of thousands of dollars.Not only that\u2026Rankers received a lot of money by appearing on shows, commercials, etc.He felt like he was seeing a new world.'I think I can be a little bit more confident. Right?'As time passed, he became calmer.And from a certain moment, instead of feeling uneasy, he began feeling pride.'Yes. Even though it was in Asra, I'm the former ranking number one.'After a few days, he began smiling more frequently.He also did that while logged in to Asrian, so Ain asked him.\"Hyun, you seemed to be happy. Did something good happen?\"\"Hmm... Well, something like that.\"Hyun, who had solely focused on gaming, started learning his position a little bit.* * *The next day\u2026Finally, both Stardust members were able to log in.Ain was late that day. so only the three of them were gathered together.\"I feel like we're receiving more attention than before...\" Practice said while walking through the Knight's Hall.Just like he'd said, they were receiving a lot of attention from the NPCs around there.Some low-ranking soldiers even bowed their heads when they saw them.After clearing the Knight Commander's Quest, their reputation among NPCs had risen.Hyun added some explanation.\"We're probably the first users to clear a quest from the Knight Commander. Being the first ones to do anything increases reputation.\"\"That means that if your reputation increases, the NPCs\u2019 interest in you grows too. Right? As expected from a hidden quest. And Hyun, who cleared such a quest, is incredible as well!\"\"It's not like I've done it alone.\"Hyun smiled bitterly at Jini's praise.For the moment, only Ain knew that he belonged to the Abyss.Who would think that, among the first users to spread their name through Heaven, there was one who belonged to the Abyss?Of course, it would've been better if his reputation among the Abyss had risen.'But this isn't bad. Right?'Hyun tried to think positively.If he had a good reputation among Heaven's Forces, people would be less suspicious of him, and the probability of him being outed as a member of the Abyss would decrease too.A few days before, he had swapped his old dark robe for a clean looking black and white one, so no one would probably mistake him again for being a Dark Priest.The Robe of the Praying Priest was luxurious, yet classy, so it suited a user with a good reputation.'It's here.'They soon reached the gymnasium, which was located on the third floor of the Knight's Hall.There was no one there.Only the top knights were allowed there, so it was a place forbidden to most users.They could enter there thanks to a message from Knight Commander Ollie.It seemed like the Knight Commander was quite surprised by how fast they'd cleared the quest.Especially Ain. Thanks to her showing the rune of a Heavenly Being, it seemed like he completely trusted her.It was a piece of cake for Hyun to control the Knight Commander while being \u00abAssimilated\u00bb to Ain.That's why he let them use the place.Just a glance was enough for Hyun to know that the place completely differed from the public gymnasium on the 4th floor.Practice and Jini were lost for words.\"The floor and the walls are made of marble...\"\"It's an enchanted marble. Most physical attacks won't be able to leave even a scratch.\"\"More than a gymnasium... This looks like a giant palace.\"The place was full of numerous fitness equipment, a place to spar, somewhere to rest, and a lot of magical equipment they weren't sure what they were.It was too much for only three people to use.There were two reasons why Hyun had chosen that place:The first one was that he wanted to increase the level of \u00abPray\u00bb in a quiet place where there wasn\u2019t anyone around.The second was that he wanted to teach both Stardust members comfortably.'Since things have gotten like this, I should teach them properly. Right?'The truth was that, when he had received Jini's request, he wanted to end it with just a few recommendations... But right then, that would make him feel guilty.He couldn't ignore those two looking at him with shining eyes.Practice invited him to eat almost every day... And he was thankful to Jini for what she did the other day.Not only that, but they'd accepted his request.\u2014That they would help him when he asked it.From what he'd seen up until then, it seemed like teaching them would be helpful for him in the future.'Well, even if I teach them properly... In reality, It's nothing that impressive.'What Hyun wanted to teach them first were some basic movements.Even though Asrian was a virtual reality game, it was fundamentally different from real life.Because neither of them had experience with the previous game, Asra Online, there was a chance that their movements were similar to those of real life.First, Hyun asked Practice a question.\"What's your Agility?\"\"Hmm? My Agility right now is... Exactly 50.\"\"Good. If you have 50 Agility, it should take you five seconds to run 100 meters. Right?\"\"Yes, something like that.\"In real life, those numbers would've been impressive, but in Asrian, that speed was normal.At that moment, Hyun smiled and asked another question.\"Then, how many times can you go back and forth a distance of one meter in 5 seconds?\"\"Back and forth...?\"\"If it's 100 meters in five seconds, can you do it 50 times?\"\"Wait, the calculations are weird...?!\"\"That's right. The speed while running straight and changing directions can't be the same!\"They both couldn't hide their surprise at Hyun's question.Of course, he also knew it was impossible.He'd asked that question because he wanted to teach them how to move in Asrian.\"Good, then how about 20 instead of 50?\"\"20 times...?\"Practice tilted his head while frowning.It looked like he couldn't get an estimate, but Hyun relieved him of his worries.\"From here to here,\" Hyun said while drawing a one-meter line with a stick.\"Run back and forth from here to there as fast as possible.\"Practice immediately followed Hyun's orders.Whish-!The speed at which he moved from left to right was fast enough to leave an afterimage, but it didn't last long.\"Ugh...!\"It took two seconds until his feets got entangled, and he lost his balance.He was able to move back and forth only five times.Practice got up and tried to do it again... But it didn't matter how many times he tried, the result was the same.Ultimately, he had no choice but to laugh and click his tongue.\"Haha, I can't do it.\"\"That's because you rely too much on your senses.\"Practice listened to Hyun's words while getting up.What Hyun was saying was something he had never heard. It wasn't mentioned in the communities, and the coaches hadn\u2019t told him either.\"As the game progresses to the latter half, there are going to be situations that will be hard to deal with using a normal human's reflexes, so the solution is to make as few decisions and judgments as possible... But senses are also some kind of judgment.\"To abbreviate Hyun's explanation:The reason why Practice fell so much was that he tried to balance himself.Even if you took 0.1 seconds to process a piece of information, that made your thought process slower, and the next movement ended up being delayed.In real life, you could probably process the information and make a judgment almost simultaneously, but in Asrian, it was impossible.Then what you had to do was ignore the sense of balance on purpose!You needed to move while thinking you were controlling a virtual character, not your real body.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\"You need to put away your senses to think faster. In my case, I'm used to doing it thanks to the previous game... But it seems most users are having trouble differentiating Asrian's movements from those of real life.\"How many users were capable of not feeling discrepancy with the game's movements?That is where a dilemma appeared.While moving, one couldn't help but feel that weird sensation.Asrian had a technology that recreated sensations, that ended up becoming poisonous for gameplay.\"The problem is that your body must move as you imagine... But you can overcome that with enough training.\"Wiinnggg-As Hyun pressed a switch inside a Magic Circle, dolls rose from the ground.When they noticed, Hyun was already holding a short sword.Paf-!Suddenly, Hyun moved at a speed at which his body couldn't be seen.Practice and Jini's mouths gaped after seeing the result.In just one second, Hyun had managed to cut five dolls that were two meters apart.He had cut exactly on their necks.\"Woah...\"\"Amazing...!\"After taking a break, Hyun explained.\"You need to think about the path from start to finish and then move at once.\"The theory behind the movements Hyun explained to them was comparable to typing.While typing, rather than thinking about each separate letter, you think about the whole sentence.The theory behind successfully chaining movements was similar to that.After thinking of the entire process, you moved only with your thoughts.\u2014That's what he meant by leaving your senses behind.\"This is the basis of all movements.\"When Hyun finished explaining, Practice and Jini had serious expressions on their faces.The two seemed to be lost in their thoughts for a while\u2014they were blankly staring at the air.Hyun waited until they finished processing what they saw; then he gave them a task.\"Let's start with the basics.\"The one-meter back and forth that Practice had failed\u2026The goal was to do it successfully 10 times in five seconds.At first glance, moving back and forth seemed like nothing. But it was perfect for getting used to the basic movements.\"It's hard...\"Even after listening to Hyun's explanation, Practice was having a hard time doing it\u2014he kept falling to the ground.That was because his thoughts couldn't catch up to his movements.\"That's because you need to get used to it.\"But Practice was still doing it better.Hyun found something that surprised him.The first two movements Practice performed were incredibly fast and reliable.\u2014That was because he had subconsciously learned it while trying to copy Ain.It was the result of trying to change the direction of the movement twice while attacking.\"It's harder than what it seems...\"Jini, who was next to him, murmured.Even though Jini was a priest, she'd raised her Agility to 30That was because Hyun had said that even Priest or Magicians needed some Agility to increase survivability.The low Agility stat meant that her movements were slower, so that should make things easier for her, but she was having more difficulties than Practice.'I'm sure she'll get used to it soon.'Hyun wasn't worried.They were both professional gamers; that meant that they were both talented people.He was sure they would learn faster than the average person.'Then... I should increase the proficiency bar of \u00abPray\u00bb.'While they were both practicing moving, Hyun was at one side of the gymnasium with his eyes closed.Because he had \u00abPray\u00bb at level 6, increasing it wasn't an easy task. That was why he tried raising the proficiency bar whenever he had free time.That's how Hyun spent the next following days inside the Knight's Hall.When Ain wasn't there, he prayed. When she logged in, they completed Heaven's Achievement Quests together and raised their stats.He also didn't forget to check on Jini and Practice for at least for 10 minutes each day.Ting.He kept receiving the message that made his heart flutter for a few days.[You've received $3,000 USD from Jinny77.]After sending him $50,000 USD, Jini continued to send him payments for the classes.It had only been three days since he had begun teaching them, but that was already the second time she'd sent him money.If it were the Hyun from before, he would've gotten scared by the sum of money... But after receiving $50,000 USD, he could look at it with relative calm.'I told her I didn't need the payment for the classes... Does this mean that she wants to be taught more rigorously?'Then it may be better if he invested a little bit more time in it.Hyun decided to increase the time of the classes from 10 minutes to 20.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just the fact that they were able to take the first step on a new level was meaningful by itself.'That's right. Because Asrian is so similar to real life, I didn't think of it as a game.'Up to that point, Jini had covered her lack of mobility with skills.But that way of doing things had limitations.During the Knight's Quest, she had been a load weight carried by Ain.The task Hyun gave her solved that dilemma.Magicians or Priests didn't raise their Agility because they didn't have skills that required it.But according to Hyun, increasing Agility was important by itself.It seemed like he wanted to say that investigating movements while having a high Agility as the foundation was one of the reasons why he used to be the number one ranking player by an overwhelming difference.'Well, Ain has a job related to Magician, but she's very agile.'Jini tried to remember the movements of them both and began practicing again little by little.At first, it was moving one meter back and forth.Once she got used to it, the next level.She tried to move while drawing a square, curves, or a circle.\"Woah, that was great!\"Hyun, who was watching the practice, was impressed.Practice had succeeded in cutting three dolls with a sword in an instant.Practice, who was progressing a bit faster than Jini, was training moving in zigzag patterns while swinging the sword.Practice, who didn't fall for the first time, shook his head.\"That was a close one... If I had more Agility, I would've probably fallen.\"\"Your specs are always changing, so you need to get used to the changes.\"\"There's really nothing easy.\"Both members of Stardust went to the third floor of the Knight's Hall every day.After all, learning the know-how of the former number one wasn't an opportunity that came easily.Hyun felt awkward.For a while, there would be nothing he could teach them.Of course, the moves he and Ain had developed through the years were complex enough that they'd be able to write a thesis on them, but teaching more complex movements to people who hadn't even mastered the basics could become counterproductive.It would probably take them months before they could pass to the next step.If they weren't professional gamers, it probably would've taken them years.'I won't need to help them for a while.'Even while teaching them, Hyun didn't leave aside his plans.He reached level 6 of \u00abPray\u00bb after a week.Whap.Strong energy started to come out from The Robes of the Praying Priest.That was the signal that showed that the item had been unlocked.When the light died down, a couple of lines had been added to the item's description.[ <The one who receives protection from a Transcendent doesn't die easily.> ]- When you're about to die, you become immortal for 3 seconds.- The time for being reborn after dying decreases by half.- If you're using \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, these effects are applied to the target.<Cooldown Time: 24 hours>'This\u2026'Hyun's eyes widened after reading the item\u2019s description.First, on the Priest's Robe, it mentioned \u00abAssimilation\u00bb.At that point, couldn't he call that an item exclusive to the Support?Later on, he needed to revise the connection between Empathy, \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, and \u00abPray\u00bb.Right then, it was more important to check out the item's specs.'This is amazing.'The word \u201cimmortal\u201d caught Hyun's attention.Unlike his skill, the item allowed him to be immortal for real.He would be able to save his life thanks to the effect of an item.'Not only that, but it decreases the death penalty.'What Hyun was the most afraid of was the penalty for dying.In Asrian, any user that died wouldn't be able to log in for 48 hours.He had already experienced it once, so he knew how critical that could be.But that item allowed him to reduce it for 24 hours.Of course, he should avoid dying if possible, but even if he did, he could recover faster than the others.Just from the item's description up to that point, the item seemed to be worth more than a unique.But what was more incredible was that the item still had hidden specs!- If [Skill: \u00abPray\u00bb] reaches level 9, you'll be able to unlock extra abilities.'There's more?'Hyun was surprised.\u00abPray\u00bb level 9\u2026As the level of skills increased, they became progressively harder to level up.Not only that, but Asrian, unlike the previous game, had sensory synchronization, so it was obvious that increasing the skill level of \u00abPray\u00bb would be harder than before.It took Hyun a week to increase the level of \u00abPray\u00bb from 4 to 6.Of course, it wasn't like he had spent the entire time praying... But getting it to 9 would probably take him a couple of months.'What kind of item has so many hidden specs?'Another thing that surprised him was that an item with such incredible abilities had just a unique category.Just being able to reduce the time of the death penalty should be enough to categorize it as legendary.He didn't even want to think about how much he could sell it for if it didn't have the Empathy restriction.Thanks to Jini, he had learned the value of Asrian-related things in real life.'It came again.'He received another message.It was a notification that Jini had sent him money.Those past few days, Hyun hadn't taught them many things. It was mostly answering some doubts they had. Despite that, Jini kept sending him money.To be honest, he felt somewhat burdened, but he didn't stop her from doing it.She must have come up with a value after thinking about it.Maybe it was him who wasn't fully aware of his own worth.Also, he'd learned the sweet taste of money those past few days.\"Did something happen?\" Ain asked him.She began wondering because Hyun had suddenly stopped and was immersed in his own thoughts.\"It's nothing.\"Hyun opened his mouth but stopped.Ain was still underage.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Maybe things could get troublesome if they talked about stuff related to money.That was something he, an adult, had to think about and find an answer to.'Now that I think about it, I was able to reach here thanks to Ain's help.'Just like Jini had compensated him, must he also compensate Ain?He decided not to forget about that.That was probably the most important thing.He would compensate her once he found some stability.Hyun kept thinking while walking through the Knight's Hall.'Was it worth it to keep going to University?'From what he'd seen, many people lived just by playing Asrian.There were things like buying and selling items, competitions, analysis, streaming, among many other options.People generated a lot of content related to Ain because there was a lot of demand for it.He had experienced being number one in the rankings, so Hyun was sure he could do anything better than them.It was weird for Hyun to care about real-life things while inside the game.It was at that moment\u2026A childlike voice interrupted Hyun's thoughts.\"Oh! I found you-!\"Someone had shouted while pointing at him, but Hyun was so immersed in his own thoughts that he didn't notice it.\"Wait, please!\"As Hyun and Ain passed by him, he quickly followed them.That's when Hyun finally saw the identity of the person calling to him.\"What? He's just a kid.\"\"Hmm... He's a little one. Hyun, do you know him?\"\"Not at all. Hey kid, I'm busy right now, so I don't have time to play with you.\"His identity was TarrTarr.He was the person who had filmed the video of Hyun and Ain hunting down Leopard.\"Wait, wait, please! Do you know for how long I've been looking for you? It's been more than a month!\"TarrTarr still didn't know Hyun's name.\u2014But he knew Ain's.That was because Ain had become a hot topic on Reddit many times.\"You're Ain, right?\"\"Eh? It seems like he's been looking for you.\"Hyun said while looking at Ain, but she just shook her head.\"I'm not interested in people I don't know.\"\"Really? By how people you don't know recognize you, it seems like you've become quite famous.\"\"Really famous! I'm sure almost every Reddit user knows her.\"\"Reddit...?\"\"You don't know Reddit? It has one of the biggest Asrian communities... That's also where I uploaded a video of you two!\"\"Hmm... I see. It seems like he's fan enough to record a video of you. Maybe he's a stalker?\"\"Not really interested... I don't need anything like that.\"\"Hey kid, you heard what she said. You better go.\"After that small talk, Hyun and Ain were about to leave.TarrTarr couldn't believe the current situation.He felt like a criminal confessing his crime while telling them that he'd recorded footage of both of them...\u00a0 But he wasn't expecting a reaction like that.Wasn't anyone going to say anything about copyright, privacy, sue him, or even talk about profits from the video...?TarrTarr shouted while trying to catch up with Hyun and Ain.\"Is that all? Don't you have anything else to say? For example, about the profits gained from the video...\"'What, profit from the video?'Usually, he would just ignore whatever a bothersome kid was saying to him, but those past few days, Hyun had been quite sensitive to money-related topics.He stopped.\"What?\"\"Profits. I recorded a video of you two, so I thought you'd be interested in topics regarding the money generated from it.\"\"We're interested, of course.\"After noticing Hyun's sudden change of atmosphere, Ain looked at him closely.As Hyun's conversation with the kid that had suddenly appeared started to prolong, Ain complained.\"Hyun... We'd decided to clear the rest of the Heaven's Achievements today... Let's get going.\"\"Oh, sorry. I have some stuff to discuss with this kid... You have to increase levels and catch up with me anyway, so farm some experience for a little while.\"\"Alone? Until when?\"\"Just a little bit? Hey kid, come here.\"Hyun grabbed TarrTarr and moved to somewhere where they could talk more comfortably.As Hyun took some time to listen, he heard TarrTarr's name and what he'd done until then, among other things.TarrTarr also told him that he had secretly recorded the footage of him fighting against Leopard.Hyun didn't understand things related to privacy, so at first, he couldn't understand what was wrong.Even though TarrTarr was a lot younger than Hyun, he knew more things about stuff related to real life.\"See this video? It has eight million views. The amount of money you can earn is approximately one dollar per thousand views. If only I had monetized the video, it would've generated at least eight thousand dollars!\"\"Wait, how much?\"Only after adjusting the translation settings did Hyun understand TarrTarr's words.\"What the\u2026 one video generated eight thousand dollars?!\"\"Yes.\"After understanding everything, Hyun's eyes changed.Tarrtarr was so startled that he backed down.\"Then... Among the eight thousand dollars, there's my part, obviously. Right?\"\"No. I didn't monetize it. It isn't even my video, so I can't do it as I wish. Also, I've put this video as private.\"\"What... Does that mean?\"\"I didn't earn anything!\"Boom- Hyun subconsciously slammed the table.\"Why didn't you do it?!\"\"Should I ask for monetization?\"\"Obviously!\"TarrTarr flinched at Hyun's shout.After looking at TarrTarr reaction's, Hyun calmed down.Now that he thought about it, it wasn't his fault.After all, he was unaware of the fact that you could earn that much money in such ways.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 - The Road Leading Up To Fate (1)'No, this isn't something to get excited about.'As the older one there, Hyun tried to calm down.First, he needed to get to know who the kid was.\"Your ID is TarrTarr?\"\"Yes.\"\"You're in middle school, right?\"Yes.\"\"Hmm\u2026\"Hyun began wondering how someone younger than him knew so much about YouTube.As the conversation got longer, he discovered that his knowledge exceeded that of a middle school student.Because TarrTarr's explanation had some complicated and specialized terms mixed in it, Hyun felt dazed from time to time.\"Were you always interested in video editing?\"TarrTarr seemed excited at Hyun's sudden question.\"Yes! I learned from my dad, and I also entered the school club!\"\"I see\u2026\"Hyun's mind began thinking fast.He remembered the rumors he'd heard before.Content business\u2026Nowadays, many people earned several times the annual salary of an average office worker just by producing and uploading videos to YouTube.And it seemed like TarrTarr had a little bit of know-how in regards to those things.He also seemed to feel in debt.'Maybe that would work?'Hyun thought of a strategy.If it were just uploading a bunch of videos, he wouldn't take the risk of getting his freedom taken away like professional gamers did.There also wouldn't be tears of blood for selling gold or items for cash.The more he thought about it, the clearer the plan became.'Wait\u2026'As Hyun was thinking, he found the first issue.'What should I do with Ain?'The Support couldn't do much by itself without a damage dealer like Ain.Except for when he had rescued Louise, Ain had always been next to him.'Will Ain collaborate with my plan?'\"What are you talking about?\"\"Huh\u2026?!\"Hyun was surprised by Ain\u2019s sudden appearance from behind.\"That video seems entertaining!\"Ain was looking with interest at the YouTube hologram video.On the screen, there was the video of Hyun and Ain hunting down Leopard.\"Oh, that's right! I was also trying to say it to you!\"\"I also have something to tell you. Ain, please sit down for a moment.\"\"Hmm, what's happening?\"The three sat down at a round table. Ain heard from TarrTarr about things related to content production and from Hyun about some plans they'd do from then on.Hyun was thinking of convincing Ain with time, but the conversation was cut short because of what she said next.\"It was about earning money with YouTube?\"\"You don't like it\u2026?\"\"Hmm.\"After looking at the footage where she appeared, she quickly lost interest.\"But I don't want to show myself to people I don't know. I don't want to.\"\"Really?\"After hearing Ain's answer, Hyun scratched his head.As the plans scattered away, Hyun's voice seemed down.'Then, should I cancel the plans?'At that moment, Ain smiled. It seemed like she'd noticed something.\"Hyun, is it because you need money?\"\"Huh? It's not that I need it, but\u2026\"\"Then you want to earn more. Right?\"\"Well, anyone wants that. Right? But I'm not going to make you do something against your will.\"\"Hmm?\"Ain's smile deepened.'He won't do it because I don't want to\u2026?!'\u2018Does Hyun know it?\u2019In Hyun\u2019s words, there seemed to be an underlying premise that he always had to be with someone.But Hyun didn't seem to be bothered by that.If it's like this\u2026 Maybe she could let Hyun do as he wished. It was sad that they had to be apart for a while, but it would probably be okay.Ain tried to hold the laughter and said, \"Hmm\u2026 If you want to, you can do it alone.\"\"I alone?\"\"I need to catch up to you anyway. Your level jumped up a lot suddenly.\"\"Then you\u2026\"\"I'll be trying to catch up to your level.\"Hyun didn't know what to say to Ain's words.\"Ain, if\u2026\"\"Oops, I need to go out. Do what you want for a while!\"['Ain' has logged out.]After Ain suddenly disappeared, Hyun finished the sentence.\"You're not here\u2026 What should I do alone\u2026?\"After Ain left, only the two were there.Unlike before, Hyun was just silent.In the end, it was TarrTarr who spoke first.\"I\u2026Think that I should take that video down. From what I've heard from other people, if the other party is sensitive in matters related to portrait rights, it's better to erase the video.\"\"Yes, that sounds right.\"Click.[Do you want to delete this unlisted video? Y/N]Hyun sighed after looking at thousands of dollars being erased. At the same time, he began looking at footage he could use.'Oof\u2026 Alone, when was the last time I was alone?'Hyun tried to remember.From what he could recall, there were only three instances.\u2014The main quest he did with Louise.\u2014The time he \u00abAssimilated\u00bb into the acrobat doll.\u2014And that time when he hunted down ghosts, but that footage had already been deleted.Because the capsule\u2019s memory wasn't unlimited, footage older than a month was automatically deleted.'There are only two other usable videos.'In the end, he ended up with just two possible candidates, but he felt uncomfortable with releasing either of them.In the recording with Louise, how he activated and deactivated his skill, \u00abAssimilation\u00bb appeared.And the video of the acrobat doll, if users saw the information about it, they'd probably be able to guess his \u00abAssimilation\u00bb skill.''Should I just upload it?'For a moment, Hyun was thinking about whether he should just reveal his \u00abAssimilation\u00bb skill, but he ended up shaking his head.'No, I shouldn't do that. I don't know what would happen if I did that.'\u00abAssimilation\u00bb was the Support's main skill and his last trump card.He should hide it until he either becomes so strong he doesn't care anymore or he learns another trump card.But recording a video of a Support without using \u00abAssimilation\u00bb was kind of pointless.'What should I do\u2026?- -'Hyun began thinking deeply.Was there a way to record a quality video without using \u00abAssimilation\u00bb?Because Hyun's eyes had become intense, TarrTarr subconsciously shrank.\"TarrTarr.\"He finally opened his mouth after a while.\"Yes\u2026?\"Then Hyun said something strange.\"Don't worry.\"\"About what?\"\"I won't sue you for uploading that video to YouTube.\"\"S-sue\u2026?!\"\"I mean, I won't do it, but instead\u2026\"* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafy* * *Neither Hyun nor TarrTarr knew if one could be sued because of that, but it really didn't matter.With a kind smile, Hyun calmed TarrTarr down. Then he kept talking.\"But instead, I want you to answer my question honestly.\"\"Y\u2026 Yes\u2026 O-of course!\"As TarrTarr's mouth became dry, Hyun began asking him questions.\"Let's say that someone tells you a very big secret and asks you to maintain it no matter what\u2026 Could you do it?\"\"Secret\u2026?\"\"No, this kind of question makes no sense.\"Hyun smiled after thinking of another way.He had a skill that allowed you to know if someone was lying to you.That skill was \u00abAssimilation\u00bb! Since it allowed you to read the other person's feelings.Of course, the moment he used it, information about that skill would be revealed, but Hyun could solve that issue easily.'It wasn't hard!'Ting-.At that moment, TarrTarr received a message.[Player 'Hyun' wants to control your soul.][Will you accept? Y/N]TarrTarr stared blankly, then carefully asked.\"Control my soul\u2026? What's this?\"\"Oh, just accept it. I'll explain it to you later.\"\"Weird\u2026\"With trembling hands, and full of doubts, TarrTarr accepted the message.Then he immediately received another message.[Player 'Hyun' wants control priority.][Will you accept?

Y/N]\"This too\u2026?\"\"Yes.\"\"\u2026\"TarrTarr felt like he was being forced to sign a suspicious contract, but he ended up doing as Hyun said.After accepting him as a friend, Hyun sent him a whisper.\u300cClose your eyes.\u300d\"The eyes\u2026?\"\u300cYes, don't open them. And from now on, answer only via whisper.\u300dPaf!The moment \u00abAssimilation\u00bb activated, TarrTarr felt slightly uncomfortable.Since his eyes were closed, he didn't know what was happening outside. He also couldn't see the status window.Hyun asked a question while focusing on his trembling feelings.\u300cDid you ever feel the urge to check another person's status window?\u300d\u300cNever.\u300d\u300cAre you good at keeping secrets?\u300d\u300cYes, probably?\u300d\u2026The interrogation-like questions kept going on for a while.'Weird.'Hyun began wondering.Even though he had asked tens of questions, TarrTarr feelings didn't shake even once.Was he telling lies without batting an eye? Or had he really not lied?'I'm sure \u00abAssimilation\u00bb isn't broken.'But a question Hyun asked him answered the doubts he was having.\u300cAre you regretting coming to see me?\u300d\u300cAh\u2026\u300d\u300cHmm?\u300d\u300cN-no\u2026 That's\u2026 Not true.\u300dIt was at that moment when TarrTarr's calm feelings became turbulent\u2026After feeling the nervousness spread through the body, Hyun finally accepted the situation.'Okay, I'm sure he won't be a problem.'Paf! After \u00abDisassimilating\u00bb, he nodded.\"You can open your eyes.\"\"What\u2026 Was that?\"Hyun smiled at the confused TarrTarr.\"Even if I don't tell you, you'll soon figure it out.\"* * *Novice Dungeon of the Necromancer\u2026It was a place where a lot of monsters that ranged from level 30 to 200 appeared.Because you could stay there from when you were a novice until you finished the second job ascension, many users stayed there for a long time.'Good, should we start?'Paf-.Suddenly, Hyun disappeared.TarrTarr was surprised after seeing him disappear.\u300cHold on for a moment. Let me check your status window.\u300dHe couldn't control his own body.It felt as if another person was forcibly using it.Only after a while did TarrTarr understand what was going on.\"No way.

For example\u2026 If you move from a certain area, the combo resets. The opponent you're attacking has to be within 50 meters\u2026 Most tricks are blocked\u2026 But I'm sure you knew about these things.\u300d\"I knew a few of them\u2026 But I wasn't aware of the ones you mentioned!\"After seeing TarrTarr answer innocently, Hyun felt he didn't need to explain anymore.\u300cWell, I guess that as long as you record the video properly, you don't need to understand everything.\u300dHyun walked toward the entrance of the dungeon.TarrTarr had begun to trust Hyun and let him do as he wished.Novice Dungeon of the Necromancer\u2026From the name, it seemed like a hunting place where low-level monsters appeared, but the truth was that it was the perfect place for a beginner to die.The first enemies to appear were level 30 skeletons, but as you advanced through the dungeon, the monsters started to get stronger.In the middle of the dungeon, level 50 skeleton archers appeared!In the latter half of the dungeon, you even had to deal with level 70 mage skeletons!If you reached the middle-boss area, you might encounter an undead army that had a level over 100.Most of the time, users only farmed within the first and second half of the dungeon\u2014maybe until the area with skeleton mages.Some parties that had rankers hunted in the area of the middle boss, but they were the exception.And because the patch had just happened, most users were doing quests related to the forces they belonged to, so the hunting grounds were empty.\"Are we going to the dungeon alone?\"\u300cWhy?\u300d\"No\u2026 It's just that I thought it may be good if we had a Priest in the party.\"\u300c There are only weak monsters here, so there's no need to receive healing.\u300dIf it were him, he would've never imagined entering the dungeon without a party, but since Hyun was so confident, TarrTarr just kept his mouth closed.The first part of the dungeon was easy.\u2014There was only one or two level 30 skeletons.Hyun took out TarrTarr's weapons.He had swords that were about 40 centimeters long in each hand.\u300cIs the weapon magic grade? It seems like you also don't have a lot of money.\u300d\"But those are quite expensive.\"\u300cOnce you earn some money, it would be better if you changed the weapons first.\u300dHyun was used to dual-wielding swords.Thief was the first job he'd picked when he first began playing Asra.He began using a long sword in the latter part of the game, but until he reached level 200, just like TarrTarr, his main weapons used to be dual swords.Swipe-Hyun ravaged the skeletons with the swords he had in both hands.Even if there were a lot of level 30 monsters, they were no threat at all.Dozens of lights shone at the same time.'It feels great.'That was the first time he used dual swords while moving, but he felt very comfortable as if he'd done it before.That meant that he had gotten used to the slight differences between Asra and Asrian.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 153 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 144 damage!]Four combo, five combo, six combo\u2026As Hyun passed by while brandishing the sword, skeletons piled up, and after a while, they disappeared.He cut, twisted, stabbed, and cut again!The attacks didn't stop\u2014they kept flowing like water.[\u00abCombo\u00bb Lv.4(+1)]- Depending on the number of the combo, the speed of attacks and movement increases.Thanks to that skill, TarrTarr's speed increased but suddenly stopped.They had beaten all the monsters around them.The moment Hyun cleared all the monsters in one area, the number of combos had reached 180.\"Woah\u2026\"TarrTarr couldn't hide his surprise after seeing Hyun annihilate the skeletons.He was surprised by the fact that his character could move like that.Because he enjoyed looking at other people's gameplay, he'd seen many videos of rankers, but he'd never seen someone use dual swords in such a clean way.\"Done! I can edit this and upload it!\"\u300cWhat are you talking about?\u300d\"We've recorded the video, so let's get out of the dungeon.\"Hyun tilted his head at what TarrTarr said.\u300cHuh? We're moving to where we're going to record the video.\u300d\"What?\"\u300cI've been a Support for too long, so it's been a while since I've used weapons\u2026 I hope the video comes out okay.\u300dHyun said while scratching his head as he started to walk forward.Because Hyun had control priority, TarrTarr was forced to follow him.Hyun eliminated level 40 skeletons as if they were nothing.Even though they were movements he'd already seen, TarrTarr was still surprised by it.He was wondering if the character was really his.All the scenes were being saved in TarrTarr's capsule memory.\"This is great! With just some editing, it will look great!\"\"Woah\u2026 So you can link the attack in such ways\u2026\"\"Can we rest for a little bit? Fighting like this must be tiring\u2026\"Hyun let TarrTarr talk and focused on defeating the enemies in front of him.To be honest, he was starting to get excited about fighting.'This feels great\u2026'Being \u00abAssimilated\u00bb to Ain and experiencing the Close-Range Magician wasn't bad, but the fighting style he originally enjoyed was this one.\u2014The sensation of his body moving faster than the speed at which he could think!Even though it was his first time using the Thief job in Asrian, he remembered all the complex movements he used in the previous game and started doing them.By the time Hyun stopped fighting, all the skeletons around them had become experience points.'I'm in good condition today.'Suddenly, stairs that lead to the underground appeared.Hyun walked toward them without doubting for a moment.\u2014It was the next area of the dungeon.\"You can record from now on. Check that the recording option is on. I'm going to properly start now.\"Hyun, who seemed bothered talking via whisper, just said it with TarrTarr's voice.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Even TarrTarr's cutesy voice sounded odd when Hyun used it.Although the tone of the voice hadn't changed, its atmosphere was completely different.\"I don't think we should go there\u2026\"TarrTarr said anxiously.\"Even parties don't frequently go down there\u2026 Because there are so many monsters, a single mistake can make you get surrounded by monsters and die. And a thief alone\u2026\"\"I know that.\"Hyun said while smiling.The place they were going to was called the dungeon's 'Core.' It was a place where monsters respawned faster than anywhere else.Basically, it was one of the most dangerous parts of the dungeon.He suddenly began remembering the past.Hunting at the core for the entire day, going to eat, hunting again, and then eating again\u2014that used to be his routine.Back then, his job used to be Thief.According to Hyun's knowledge, it was the best place for a Thief oriented to \u00abCombo\u00bb like TarrTarr to hunt.\"You just have to trust me. Just focus on recording.\"TarrTarr quickly reached the next area.As soon as they went down, a level 50 skeleton soldier appeared.TarrTarr calmed down.That was because, instead of walking toward the core, Hyun approached an enemy that was separated from the rest.But that relief suddenly became doubt.\"Huh?!\"Hyun put both weapons away\u2026And then suddenly started to punch the skeleton.\"You can't deal damage without a weapon\u2026\"\"You can.\"As if he were a professional boxer, Hyun punched the skeleton while dodging its attacks and led it toward the wall.Just like Hyun said, although it was little, he was definitely dealing damage.[You've dealt 5 damage!][You've dealt 3 damage!]\"I'm working on a combo.\"\"That\u2026 Shouldn't work.\"TarrTarr looked at Hyun, who was controlling his body, with doubt.He had also tried doing that, so he knew the result.Hyun was trying to lower the damage output to increase the combo.If it worked, more Thieves would've obtained the combo achievement.But the truth was that it wasn't that easy.Only 1% of all Thiefs had the achievement of doing more than 250 combos, and there was a reason for that.\"I've also tried that before.\"But Hyun ignored TarrTarr and just focused on hitting the skeleton.25 combo, 26 combo, 27 combo\u2026He kept punching the skeleton while moving with proper steps as if his job was a Fighter.If someone were next to them watching, they wouldn't have guessed that TarrTarr's job was Thief.No, they would probably be confused without being able to tell what his job was.Hyun took out the swords again once the number of combos approached 50.[49 combo! You've dealt 89 damage!][50 combo! You've dealt 103 damage!][You've dealt too many consecutive weak attacks to the same opponent!][You can't get any more combo from his opponent!]The moment he defeated the opponent with exactly 50 combos\u2026He received that message!It was a system that blocked users from exploiting tricks.You would soon reach the limit if you attacked a normal monster with weak attacks.There was no way Hyun wouldn't know about that.'Now!'Hyun had been waiting for the moment to reach 50 combos. He grabbed a stone on the floor and threw it toward a skeleton warrior in the distance.The stone flew toward it and hit the skeleton warrior on the forehead.[51 combo! You've dealt 2 damage!]As the message appeared, Hyun moved forward at a frightening speed.He hit the next opponent with his punch and started to push it toward the corner.TarrTarr watched with his mouth gaping at how Hyun connected the combo.\"Was that timing calculated?\"Hyun didn't answer TarrTarr's question because he was too focused on hitting the skeleton.Even without Hyun answering his question, TarrTarr soon discovered the answer.Just the moment he was about to reach 100 combos, Hyun took out the double swords.[99 combo! Critical Hit! You've dealt 235 damage!][100 combo! Critical Hit! You've dealt 241 damage!][You've dealt too many consecutive weak attacks to the same opponent!][You can't get any more combo from his opponent!]The moment Hyun reached 100 combos, he quickly moved toward the next target.He didn't forget to throw a stone.All those movements connected naturally, and the number of combos pilled up.'Oh, my god\u2026'TarrTarr's mouth was gaping.The proper fight hadn't even begun yet, but he was already feeling chills after looking at the combos pilling up.Because it was his job, he knew how difficult it was to do something like that.'Something like this was possible\u2026?'Every single movement up to 0.1 seconds was calculated.Just one mistake would be enough to break the combo, but Hyun was using every single second to draw the perfect picture.237 combo, 238 combo, 239 combo.TarrTarr soon discovered something else.He was so impressed by the movements, the timing, and other physical stuff that he hadn't noticed it yet.'He had already planned out the entire fight route?'____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 - The Road Leading Up To Fate (3)The dungeon core was a hunting ground where lots of skeletons came out, so even if you were with a full party, you had to fight non-stop.There had been many cases of parties making a mistake regarding the route taken, grabbing the attention of a massive crowd of undead monsters, and ending up dying.However, Hyun was focusing on fighting against only a single skeleton at a time.Hyun's movements were more complex than what TarrTarr thought.Not only that, but there were some things Hyun still hadn't told him.[You've knocked down the same kind of monsters using a similar patron.][You won't get any more combo from a skeleton soldier for the next 5 minutes.]He received a system message when he defeated the 5th skeleton warrior.There were more restrictions to making a combo work than what TarrTarr had initially thought.For example, TarrTarr didn't know that there was a restriction to the number of combos you could obtain by fighting the same kind of monsters.'Okay, next.'Hyun had already planned out the entire thing, so he started moving without doubting for a moment.Swipe- Clang![251 combo! You've dealt 21 damage!]The novice dagger he threw hit the 'skeleton warrior.'After grabbing the weapon from the floor, he began hitting it with his fists.[280 combo! You've dealt 3 damage!][281 combo! You've dealt 2 damage!][New Record! You've broken the previous combo record!]While doing that, he broke TarrTarr's previous record.TarrTarr was so overwhelmed by what he saw that he just watched while trying to hold his breath.Before, it was against the 'skeleton soldier,' and now the target was the 'skeleton warrior.'There didn't seem to be an end to Hyun's combos.[300 combo! You've obtained the achievement \u2018Skilled Soldier\u2019!][400 combo! You've obtained the achievement \u2018Veteran Weapon's Specialist\u2019!]One of the skills of a Thief, \u00abCombo\u00bb, had the characteristic that it increased the speed of your attacks as the number of combos increased.That meant that, while hunting, the speed of the attacks increased, the number of combos also increased, and at the same time, that made the speed go up even more.That's how Hyun looked at that moment.[500 combo! You've obtained the achievement \u2018Mercenary Master\u2019!][You won't get any more combo from skeleton warriors for the next 5 minutes.]'Okay, next!'Hyun's sight was rapidly placed on the next target.That time, it was the skeleton sentry\u2019s turn!770 combo, 771 combo, 772 combo.TarrTarr felt more scared than chills while the number of combos increased.'How long is this going to go on for?'He felt an alien feeling.For a moment, he had forgotten that he was recording a video and had become a spectator.[1000 combo! Critical Hit! You've dealt 792 damage!][You won't get any more combo from skeleton sentries for the next 5 minutes.][You've obtained the achievement \u2018Frenzy of Consecutive Attacks\u2019!][Your Agility has increased by 1!]'It's the first time I've seen a thousand combo in real life!'TarrTarr had seen many videos of famous Thief rankers, but he had never seen someone reach a thousand combo so easily.There were videos of some users that had surpassed the 1000 combo mark.But the gameplay of those people, rather than clean, looked desperate.On the other hand, Hyun's gameplay made him think that maybe he would be able to copy it one day.'Although I'm sure I won't be able to do it if I try it...'And there was another thing that TarrTarr noticed.From the moment the number of combos surpassed a thousand, it became even harder to maintain it.[The speed is too fast!][Only attacks faster than 0.8 seconds will count towards the combo!]That was when Hyun began properly moving.While running, he threw the weapons in his hands.Clang-![1001 combo! You've dealt 53 damage!]The dagger, after hitting the skeleton mage, bounced into the air.Hyun then proceeded to reduce the distance between them.He grabbed the dagger that was in the air and slashed it three times with both hands.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 803 damage!][You've dealt 573 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 803 damage!]From the moment the skeleton mage became dust, the real battle began.The dungeon's core was the place where monsters respawned faster.As he jumped right into the middle, he caught the undead monsters\u2019 attention, and they began charging toward him.\"Ugh...!\"TarrTarr was overwhelmed by the hellish sight.There was an army of hundreds of undead monsters in front of him.That was probably how the only human to survive a fight against monsters felt.\"Oof...\"After taking a deep breath, Hyun began moving.He slashed again and again and then cut the incoming army of skeletons.While fighting an army of undead, you didn't need fancy techniques.Enemies that weren't afraid of receiving attacks were the perfect target for accumulating combos.'I just need to be careful about being surrounded.'Whoosh-Suddenly, there was a blue aura coming out of TarrTarr's feet.Hyun had used the Support's skill, \u00abPowerless Wave\u00bb.'Thanks to its effect, the defense of enemy monsters became 0.Even if there were some elite monsters mixed among the crowd, thanks to that skill, they were no different from normal monsters.[1157 combo! You've dealt 703 damage!][1158 combo! You've dealt 1053 damage!]As the speed went up, the number of combos increased exponentially.[1300 combo! You've obtained the achievement \u2018High-Speed Run\u2019!][1500 combo! You've obtained the achievement \u2018Reaper's Blade\u2019!][Your Agility has increased by 1!]Notifications of new achievements kept appearing.To Hyun, the decimal point appeared rounded up.[Your Agility has increased by 2!]\"Woah...\"A muffled sound came out of Tartar's mouth.He couldn't keep track of what was happening.How many times per second did he change direction?Swipe-\u00a0As the sight changed instantly, he felt he was about to get motion sickness.It was hard to keep an eye on the screen. The only thing that he could clearly see was the current number of combos.The number of combos was increasing ridiculously fast.TarrTarr began wondering about something.\u2018How can he increase the number of combos so fast?\u2019'Ah... That's it!'He finally understood after a while.\u2014The snowball effect of combos!A snowball that rolls on a slope grow in size more rapidly as time goes on.\u2014Increasing the number of combos was no different from that.Now that the number of combos had surpassed a thousand, the speed had reached a point wherem with TarrTarr's current abilities, he wouldn't be able to control it.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *But if he could do it, the speed would just keep increasing.[2000 combo!

You've dealt 1912 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 1848 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 1859 damage!][You've dealt 1295 damage!]One hit, one kill!The scene resembled one of an action movie in which the speed of reproduction was increased by two.There was one reason why hunting in the dungeon's core was so hard.\u2014It didn't matter how many monsters you'd killed, they kept appearing one after the other.And once the party's formation was broken and their mana plummeted down, the party would naturally die.But right then, TarrTarr was fighting alone against the undead army and was in an advantageous position.In other words, he was as effective as a full party.Thuck- Thuck-While fighting against the monsters in front of him, an arrow came flying.Even in the midst of a frantic fight, Hyun saw the new enemies that had appeared in the distance.'Long-range mobs?'Hyun quickly changed the movements.He began moving shorter, faster, and irregularly.He moved in zigzag and leaped forward and backward. He never stayed still.And then he jumped to where the skeleton archers were standing.The dual swords shone.As he cut and stabbed, the skeleton archer disappeared.Two cuts were enough!Normally, level 65 skeleton archers wouldn't die so easily, but thanks to the combo's effect, his damage output had been multiplied to more than ten, so a critical hit was enough to kill them.As the two swords cut through gracefully as if they were dancing, the skeleton archers began dying in masses.[3000 combo! You've obtained the achievement \u2018Road of the Swordsman\u2019!][Your Agility has increased by 1!][You can't control the speed anymore...!][Only attacks faster than 0.6 seconds will count towards the combo!]'Finally, the three thousand combo\u2026'Hyun stopped fighting after receiving that message.After seeing skeleton mages approach him, he quickly took a decision.'I'm going to get out of here.'He quickly changed the direction and started running away.While doing that, he maintained the combo.TarrTarr's movements got slower.\u2014The speed had been reset after breaking the combo.But that only happened after they reached an area with no monsters.\"Uhmm...\"TarrTarr made strange noises with his mouth wide-opened.Hyun smiled and began explaining.He thought that TarrTarr was wondering why he had suddenly stopped fighting.\"With your current specs, it's harder to go beyond the three thousand combo safely. It would've been different if you'd learned passives related to attack speed or moving speed. Without those, it's hard to maintain 0.6 seconds.\"But TarrTarr wasn't hearing Hyun's explanation.After ordering his thoughts, he finally asked him.\"Can... I really upload this video?\"\"What are you talking about? Didn't we come here to record a video to upload?\"\"Y-yes! That's true, but...\"TarrTarr got immersed in thoughts.He remembered what had happened after he uploaded the footage of the hidden named boss monster. The members of the guild he used to belong to had criticized him for doing that.\"If I upload this video... Won't everyone learn about your know-how? And just for a little bit of money...\"\"You were worried about that?\"After \u00abDisassimilating\u00bb, Hyun appeared in front of TarrTarr and made an unpleasant smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 - Ways to Earn Money (1)\"It's okay. Let them try copying.\"\"What...?\"\"Most of them probably don't even know the basics about moving... I wonder howlong it will take before someone that can imitate me appears.\"Even if his know-how was revealed, and if someone who could imitate himappeared, it didn't matter.To accumulate thousands of combos, you had to give up many things.It was a way of playing that had many limitations.Not only that, but the Thief was a weak job for PvP.If more users that began converting their characters to a combo accumulating one, it meant that they'd just make things easier for him. From Hyun's point of view, it was as if dangerous opponents were getting out of his way of their own volition.\"Not only that, but accumulating thousands of combo is hard if the opponent isn't anundead. These were monsters that didn't defend themselves; that's why I was ableto obtain so many combos.\"\"Is that way you picked the necromancer's dungeon...?\"\"Yes.\"Hyun added something more to his answer at TarrTarr's mumbling.\"I also used to hunt around this place frequently.\"\"You used to...?\"TarrTarr tilted his head at Hyun's words but soon came to a realization.\"Oh! Were you perhaps an Asra Online user?!\"\"Well, yeah.\"TarrTarr was surprised as Hyun answered as if it were nothing.Asra Online\u2026It was a game that NFM had offered in Korea, but there wasn't a lot of informationabout it.After Asrian came out, Asra's servers had almost immediately closed.Not only that, but it didn't have a lot of users, so most top guilds had made greatefforts to incorporate people with experience in Asra.Finally, TarrTarr understood the doubt he had from the moment he filmed theLeopard footage up until then.\"I see. That's why you were so good since the beginning!\"\"Okay, calm down. Did you record the video properly?\"\"Yes, of course! Just the thought of editing and uploading it is making me excited.\"\"Good, but there's still something we haven't talked about\u2026 And that's how thisbusiness partnership will work.\"Whew-After taking a deep breath, Hyun's eyes shone.Why had he let him record footage where he did 1500-count combos?Hyun rapidly ordered his thoughts.If he provided the footage and TarrTarr edited and uploaded it. How should theydistribute the earnings?'Is eight and two good enough...?'Of course, he would get eight.After all, only he would probably be able to provide such high-quality footage.Thinking about his own worth, maybe he could offer a nine to one.Hyun decided to get more self-confidence and make a deal.\"In regards to the earnings... Hmm... Maybe we can adjust it in the future, but let'sstart with nine to one.\"\"Oh, that? Just take everything.\"\"Hmm, yeah. Maybe nine to one was too much... Wait, what?\"Hyun thought for a moment that he'd heard wrong.\u2014But he hadn't.TarrTarr answered while making an innocent smile. If it were him, he would've neverimagined answering that.\"While hunting, you're increasing my levels and getting me new achievements.That's more than enough!\"\"I\u2026 I guess that's true...?\"\"And video editing is my hobby, so as long as many people see it, I'm okay.\"Hyun was moved by what he said.At first, he'd thought he was just a bothersome little kid, but in reality, he was a nicekid.He felt ashamed of himself for trying to get as much money as possible.Hyun quickly added.\"No, but I can't leave you with nothing. Think of it as a tip. Hmm... Is 10% okay withyou? I'm sure this will also help you to maintain your motivation,\" Hyun said with a generous smile.He could smile because, at the time, he didn't know how much money that was.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafy* * *After saying goodbye to Hyun, TarrTarr contacted someone.\u2014Arneng.They'd first met in the guild TarrTarr used to belong, and after that incident, he had always offered TarrTarr some advice.As time went on, Arneng had become a brotherly figure to TarrTarr.Also, Arneng had a YouTube channel he used to earn money and live.Thanks to that, he'd given some suggestions to TarrTarr about how to deal with thefootage of another person.Arn: What? Is that true?TarrTarr: Yes!Arneng laughed while talking through the capsule's messaging system.TarrTarr's story began from when he met Hyun and Ain.It seemed like neither of them even knew that they'd become a viral sensation.And even after knowing what had happened, they didn't seem to care about it.After hearing that you could earn a lot of money with YouTube, the eyes of one ofthe two changed, but even that wasn't enough to grab the other person's interest.Arneng laughed at their non-conventional reaction.Of course, it wasn't that he thought they were dumb.It was because he discovered how those people treated the game.Arn: I see... If you want to reach a level like that, you need to be so immersed in itthat you can't see anything but the game. I'm sure they're both weird people.TarrTarr: Despite having unique personalities, they seemed like nice people.Arn: Yes, I'm glad. Not only the worst scenario didn't happen. It seems like you won'tget into any trouble at all. It's especially good that you won't get into trouble becauseof the portrait rights.While talking through the capsule, they soon reached the last topic.\u2014That he would use Hyun's footage to edit a video and upload it to YouTube.But that time, unlike before, he would turn on the monetization!Arn: Nine to one? Really? Haha, it seems like that friend doesn't know what he's worth! Arneng laughed after hearing TarrTarr's story about how they would distribute the earnings.Arn: You'll probably earn more money than me from now on!TarrTarr: Really?!Arn: It's hard to tell since I haven't seen the footage... But if he can keep the qualityof the fight against the named monster, even 10% should be enough to earn morethan the average salaryman.Arneng knew about the potential of the two because he'd seen the Leopard video.He was confident about his skill of judging other users.Although he was also a top user, those two were probably above the level of aranker.Even Arneng, who'd seen the footage of many top rankers, had shaken his headafter looking at their videos for the first time.He thought that, even if he tried hard for many years, he wouldn't be able to catch upto them.A gameplay footage of such a level being uploaded to YouTube?And on top of that, continuously?He wasn't sure how many videos TarrTarr was planning to upload, but he couldimagine the number of views he'd be able to get.People were always drawn to what was special and the best.Arn: I'll give you one tip\u2026Suddenly, Arneng couldn't help but make a mischievous smile.Arn: I'm not sure if you're going to keep going through this route, but there'ssomething you need to know if you're planning to become a YouTuber.TarrTarr: What's that?Arn: Uploading a video after editing it is okay... But you can get more people'sattention by splitting the video or creating a narrative. You'll know what I'm talkingabout if you look at my channel. Of course, you shouldn't exactly copy what I do. Itwould help if you thought of your own strategy, but thinking about these topics willhelp you develop your own know-how.Arneng told TarrTarr some suggestions based on his experience.With his eyes shining, TarrTarr tried to remember every suggestion.* * *Those days, Hyun's routine was defined.While Ain was online, it was more effective trying to get either an achievement ordoing a quest.But since she was still in high school, they couldn't be together for the entire day.When she wasn't there, he either stayed on the 3rd floor of the Knight Hall praying,planned some business with TarrTarr, or focused on EXP farming.One of the biggest advantages of belonging to the Heavens was that one couldeasily reach level 100 just by staying in the Knight Hall.After a few days, Hyun finally reached his goal.He was moved by the fact that he was able to reach that point with the Supportjob.[You've reached level 100!

After all,they're relatively generous to humans.[Reward: One of the top Support's jobs, 1 awakening skill point](* You can use the awakening skill point to level up a skill or change it for a newawakening skill.)\"Get the recognition of an NPC...?\"Hyun tilted his head after checking out the quest's window.But the doubts soon disappeared, and he made an unpleasant smile.\"But I've already been recognized by a strong NPC!\"The Commander who was in charge of the Knight's Hall, Ollie.He was the first one he thought of.After clearing the 'Evil's Seed' quest, the Hyun and the rest of the part\u2019s recognition amongst the Heaven\u2019s Forces had increased.The trust Ollie had in them had especially increased a lot.He was an NPC that was over level 400!He happened to meet the quest's pre-requisite.'Fufu, this is great. If it weren't for this, I'd probably have a lot of trouble.'Hyun laughed at the quest's description.Receiving the recognition of an angel was one way of doing it?Of course, Transcendents like angels or demons were the strongest beings in thegame.It was better to be recognized by the strongest possible NPC. So going to find eitherone of them was probably one way...'A way? Don't joke with me!'There was no way such important entities could recognize a level 100 Support!'There's no way.'After reading the word \u2018angel\u2019, he thought of Louise, but soon shook his head.He didn't know how strong the weak Louise had gotten. He also didn't know whenhe would be able to meet her.Hyun quickly erased the word \u2018angel\u2019 from his head.Following what the system said exactly was probably dangerous.Hyun was able to make that decision because he'd suffered too many times fromphishing.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I've been hearing a weird rumor these days.\"Hyun did his best to change his expression.It seemed like the Knight Commander was about to give him another quest.'Even if he doesn't completely trust me yet, I'll probably be able to revert that if I complete another quest.'Just as Hyun thought, Ollie began saying things that resembled a quest intro.\"Have you ever heard about an existence called a demon?\"\"Demon...?\"\"Yes, demons are both cunning and evil. Not only that, they're so strong that a human can't go against them.\"Because those were all things Hyun already knew about, he just nodded.He had chosen the Support job because Keidrial had deceived him.\"The problem is that, after remaining silent for hundreds of years, the reports of people seeing them have recently increased. If the rumors are true, the Empire must respond in advance.\"Ollie's sharp eyes met Hyun's.\"I know you have a talent for 'infiltration.' That's also probably why you've been able to find the Evil's Seed, so I want to give you a similar task.\"Ting-!<Heaven's Hidden Linked Quest: Search for the Traces of Evil>- The Knight Commander is asking you to bring more information about the traces of evil.[Reward]- Heaven's Medal of Honor x 15- All stats +6- The Empire's Knight Commander's Necklace(* The fact he's entrusting someone with his necklace means he completely trusts that person.)\"Okay.\"Hyun immediately replied.[You've accepted the Knight Commander Ollie's Quest!]Anyway, to complete the job ascension quest, he had to be recognized by the Commander.As soon as Hyun replied, just as if he'd been expecting this answer, he took out a certain item and gave it to him.\"Accept this.\"It was a little glass bottle that had a liquid inside.\"It's a potion that can erase the Heaven's Rune that's on the back of your hand. The effect lasts for an hour.\"\"If you're giving me this, that means...\"\"Yes, you'll have to go to the Hates Valley this time. There's a rumor that says that a demon has appeared there. It's a place frequented by followers of the Abyss, so this potion should be useful for you.\"After giving him a leather poach, Ollie kept talking.\"Maybe you're going to need these things. Inside here, there's a piece of the monster's skin and nails. They're things we've found at the place where people said that a demon had appeared.\"\"I see...\"\"First, go to the Abyss Repository. It's a place where you can find all information related to the Abyss. Go there and find more traces of the demon.\"Those were all things Hyun already knew about, so he just nodded.\"These are all the clues we have. I know it will be hard, so don't be afraid to fail.\"\"Leave it to me.\"As soon as Hyun left the Knight Commander's room, he called TarrTarr.Because the Knight Hall was the last place he was at before logging out, they found each other soon.He asked him the most important question first.\"Did you upload the video?\"\"Yes, I finished editing it and just uploaded it.\"\"Really? Let's see it.\"TarrTarr turned on the hologram.There was a new video on a YouTube channel with the ID TarrTarr.Because he didn't want to manage it, he had asked TarrTarr to use the channel he was already using.Not only that, but he didn't give him the footage. It was TarrTarr who had recorded it on his own.People say that the quality of the footage was better in terms of quality if the editor recorded it, but the truth was that he just thought it was too bothersome.\"Woah...\"A groan came out of Hyun's mouth as he watched the video.Even though he had direct it himself, TarrTarr\u2019s edited video had the ability to draw a user's attention.\"Woah, it really looks like a movie. No, it looks more amazing than one.\"Since Hyun had almost never seen a movie, it was hard for him to make a precise comparison, but he knew that the video was incredibly well made!\"Hmm?\"After watching the video again, Hyun found something weird.\"Where's the first part? It seems you've only used the footage recorded after surpassing a thousand combos... It doesn't show how the combos were stacked at the beginning.\"\"Oh, I didn't include that on purpose.\"\"Eh, why? I'm sure that's what people will wonder the most about.\"\"That's exactly why,\" TarrTarr said while smiling.That was a strategy he'd come up with after listening to Arneng's advice.But since Hyun didn't understand it, TarrTarr explained it to him again.\"Look at this.\"Even though the video didn't have that many views, many people were commenting on it.Hyun read the comments through the auto-translate option.- Woah, I was lost for words while watching.- Who's this?- This person seems to be almost as good as me!Most people were writing short exclamations or jokes, but some wrote about the missing first part.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *- Where's the first part of the video?- Can't you also upload the first part?- I could also do it if I could kill skeletons in one or two hits, had amazing controlling abilities, and practiced a lot... But for this to be even possible, first you must have the ultimate attack 'Trance' and surpass a thousand combo points! So, my point is... How can you stack so many combos?!- Hmm, I also have Trance... But after looking at this video... I decided to keep doing what I've been doing.- Crazy combo snowball effect!After looking at countless similar comments, Hyun understood what TarrTarr was saying.While feeling a little bit of a chill, he looked at TarrTarr, who seemed to be enjoying people's reactions.Hyun began thinking that maybe TarrTarr had more talent for it than he initially thought.Ain had to do her best to reduce the level gap between them for a while, so Hyun started to wonder if he should use him as a temporary damage dealer.'Should I take TarrTarr to the Knight Commander's Quest?'If he recorded while doing a quest together... He should be able to upload tens of high-quality videos. Right?To gain the confidence of the Knight Commander, he had to do at least one more quest.Right then, there wasn't anyone else, so maybe moving with TarrTarr wasn't a bad idea.It was nighttime for TarrTarr, so it was a great time for him to game!* * *A few days ago, Salon had reached level 90 as a Thief.He proudly smiled after reading his name in the Hall of Fame.He couldn't believe that his name was near rank 900.\"Oof... I finally became a ranker.\"Salon had a very good gaming sense.After all, he was the first user to find the Count's Quest, which had become a hot topic some time ago.Of course, because of the big mistake he made, all party members ended up dying.To make himself accountable, he ended up leaving the party.The party members who had been together with him since the beginning tried to convince him otherwise, but he felt responsible for the mistake he'd made.But right then, he thought that he had made the correct decision.\"Maybe I'm more suited to hunting alone.\"During the Count's Quest\u2026He had almost lost his mind after being annihilated by the Dark Priest.Once the news that the Dark Priest was actually a user came out, he didn't see a way to catch up to her.But that struggle helped him improve.'If I don't have a talent for PvP... I will try to become the best at what I'm good at!'At first, he was hunting to empty his mind.But unexpectedly, he discovered that he had a talent for solo playing!His level began increasing at an incredible speed.In one week, he went up eight levels. Then, it was 10.In RPG games, leveling up became harder as time went on, but Salon was leveling up faster as time passed.'What happened?'Salon was impressed by his speed of growth.The truth was that he had an idea about what the reason was.The main reason why he was growing at such speed was that he was getting better at playing.In PvP, because the opponents were people, there were a lot of changes and variables, but monsters moved in a relatively simpler way.Optimizing fights that didn't have many variables was Salon's specialty.And among that, the thing he was the most confident about was comboing!Salon was a combo-specialized Thief.While hunting alone, he started to have more time to think, and he also had more time to investigate about combos.That's how he started to develop one or two personal techniques, and after practicing a lot, he became one of the top combo-specialized Thieves.'Is it that other people aren't aware of this way of doing things?'After discovering his talent, he wrote some posts in the communities or even uploaded videos.But the reaction from other people was the same. They struggled with even the easiest movements.Even famous rankers could barely imitate his movements after practicing for a long time.Not only that, but because of some videos, some people had categorized him as a bug user.It was a video where he wiped out a group of hundreds of enemies. Some people said the damage output was too strong compared to the level.Those people said that he was using some sort of damage hack.'What a pathetic bunch, so if there's something you don't know, is it either a hack or a bug?'Because the comments were getting more aggressive, he had revealed his ultimate attack.It was his secret. He had obtained it after clearing the third level of the awakening quest.[\u00abSword of Despair\u00bb]- Depending on the number of combos, the damage slightly increases.- If less than 2000 combo, increase the combo consideration time by 0.5 seconds.Compared to the other third-level awakening quest ultimate attack, Trance, the number of increased damage wasn't that high, but the attack speed by which it was decided if an attack ended up in a combo or not increased, so it was safer in terms of stacking combos.That was also the reason why he wasn't overwhelmed while facing an army of monsters alone.In the video people thought was a bug, the number of combos was almost at a thousand. Thanks to that, the damage output was increased by 2.5 times; that was why he was able to kill all the enemies in one or two hits.The effects of Salon revealing his know-how were bigger than he initially thought.The preferences for ultimate attacks completely changed\u2014especially among combo-oriented Thieves, picking \u00abSword of Despair\u00bb became a must.\u300cHow should I proceed in the awakening quests to obtain the \u00abSword of Despair\u00bb?\u300dThe Thief boards were full of questions like that.There was also a strategy that allowed users always to obtain \u00abSword of Despair\u00bb as a reward.'He... With this, you could say that I've become relatively famous. Right? It seems like the number of users that recognize me has increased as well.'As time went on, Salon's presence grew.In some of the boards where he was active, some people used the word 'Name' on him as a nickname.One day\u2026A video caught his attention on YouTube.It was a video that was on the suggested videos list.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 -\u00a0 Ways to Earn Money (3)Salon laughed the moment he saw the title.<AlphaGo Level Of Control! The Ultimate Combo Thief Has Appeared!>That video with an eye-catching title, despite having been uploaded just then, already had 30 thousand views.AlphaGo was the name of an old AI that played Go. It had become the basis for most modern AI. So, from a certain point, it became a word to describe an AI with a high IQ.'Another click-bait title. I'm just going to watch it because it caught my attention.'Woah- The moment Salon clicked, he was awed.Unlike the cheap title, the video was of great quality.The video showed a user running in slow motion toward an army of undead monsters.The video showed Hyun running toward the battlefield after reaching a thousand combo.The scene of jumping alone toward the enemy made him look like the last samurai.The user's face had been mosaiced because of privacy, which made him look more mysterious.'This is quite cool!'The moment the user landed on the floor, the speed of the video became normal.The battle began.From the moment the user cut a skeleton mage three times, the video began flowing at a speed that made it seem as if it'd been fast-forwarded.\"Hmm?\"Salon's eye shone.The movements of the user that appeared on the video, although he was just stabbing and cutting, were unbelievably short.Even though he wasn't using any active skills, the movements looked fancy.'Woah, he's good.'Salon looked at the video closely.The video varied from a first-person to a third-person perspective.While looking at it, Salon noticed something.\"Wait... His ultimate attack isn't \u00abSword of Despair\u00bb.\"The user\u2019s attacks were getting much stronger as the combos stacked.The skeleton archers that needed three hits were suddenly dying with just single attacks.It was unreasonably high damage!Salon's heart began beating faster.The reason was that he had figured out what the ultimate skill of the user appearing in the video was.\"He learned \u00abTrance\u00bb?\"Although \u00abSword of Despair\u00bb and \u00abTrance\u00bb were similar in terms of use case, they were different.\u00abSword of Despair\u00bb extended the time in which combos were counted up until two thousand, so it was more reliable than \u00abTrance\u00bb, but in exchange, the damage you dealt was lower.'How did he stack combos without \u00abSword of Despair\u00bb at the beginning?'The time you had to stack combos was a second.As they began stacking, your speed increased, so it didn't matter later on, but the problem was the beginning!Stacking combos at the beginning should be hard because of the slow speed, but the user of the video was at a thousand... No, more than two thousand combos!'What kind of magic did you use at the beginning!'Salon kept looking at the video with great attention.The speed at which the user was moving was starting to get hard to follow.If it weren't for the slow-motion segments the editor had placed in certain areas, there would've been things he would have missed.The number of combos at that point was probably at least two thousand... Or maybe even three thousand!Salon had never been able to stack so many combos.To be able to do so many combos, you had to find a place where monsters appeared in masses, but you couldn't face such a big army with the \u00abSword of Despair\u00bb.The main reason was the lack of damage.Monsters weaker than you didn't count toward the combo, so they had to be at least the same level or higher.But if opponents kept appearing and the number increased, you would easily be surrounded and defeated.'Did I pick wrong...?'After looking at the video many times, he began wondering about that.If only he could accumulate a thousand combos while knowing \u00abTrance\u00bb\u2026!Maybe he would have also been able to run toward an army of monsters in a cool way like that.'Of course, I'll have to practice... But I should be able to copy that within a month. Probably... Right?'Thankfully, there was something called an 'Awakening Point.' By using it, you could either level up your Ultimate Attack or change it for another one of the same level.The \u00abSword of Despair\u00bb and \u00abTrance\u00bb happened to both be Ultimate Attacks that belonged to the third level.He still had a chance to change it.'Damn, but how did you do the first part!'The only problem was reaching a thousand combo.Without knowing how he had done it, he couldn't confidently say whether \u00abTrance\u00bb was better or not.Salon began reading the comments on the video.There, he could see many users that were complaining about the same thing.Since the first part of the video wasn't uploaded, some people were saying that a bug had been used.Although those kinds of people were the ones Salon hated the most, he agreed with them that time.'Hmm...?'After opening the video description, Salon read a message the video's uploader had left.TarrTarr: It seems like many people are wondering about the missing part. Since so many asked for it, I will upload the first part this week : ) please give some love to the channel TarrTarr from now on!After reading it, he calmed down.'Okay, if you're going to upload the rest, I'll click on it one more time. This guy seems to be a Thief master, just like me... Should I subscribe to him? I think that I'll be able to get useful information from time to time.'From that day onwards, every time he got a notification, he entered TarrTarr's channel.But because the video he wanted was uploaded later, he had to watch another three videos about other topics.The fun thing was that Salon also watched the other videos of TarrTarr from start to finish without skipping.Hyun looked at TarrTarr proudly.Although he was still in middle school, for Hyun, he was someone more talented and capable than most adults.That meant he was someone that could be of great help to him.'Did he say that the amount earned was 0.00077 per view?'He couldn't believe that the video had generated $200 USD on just the first day.According to TarrTarr, the video was soon going to get momentum, and once that happened, it was hard to guess how many views it would obtain.Of course, Hyun was satisfied with the current earnings, but hearing TarrTarr's affirmation scared him sometimes because it didn't feel real.'What would happen if I uploaded multiple videos simultaneously...?'Just the thought of money coming his way made him excited.That's why Hyun had decided on the next objective.\"Good job, TarrTarr. Now that I think about it, I haven't taken good care of you. So that's why...\"Hyun said to TarrTarr as if he were doing him a favor.\"Why don't you come with me to do a hidden quest? You can also record some videos while we're doing the quest. Let's kill two birds with one stone.\"\"Hidden Quest\u2026?\"\"Yes, it's the Knight Commander's Quest... This one allows a party of two people, so that's why I thought of taking you.\"\"R-Really?!\"\"Of course. You're editing for me, so you have enough right to come with me.\"\"Thanks!\"TarrTarr suddenly hugged Hyun.Hyun wasn't expecting that kind of affection, so he pushed him a little bit with an uncomfortable expression on his face.Then he shared the quest with TarrTarr.[ <Heaven's Hidden Linked Quest: Search for the Traces of Evil> ]\"It's my first time seeing a hidden quest!\"\"If you're at my level, you don't care about normal quests.\"\"As expected from a stagnant water from Asra!\"'\u2026?'At that moment, Hyun began wondering how the auto-translating option inside the game worked.He already knew that TarrTarr wasn't Korean.But what did he say that it translated to stagnant water?'Well, I guess the important thing is that he recognizes my greatness...'He contacted Ain first before doing the quest.\u300cAin, I just reached level 100... So I'm going to do my job ascension quest. I may be a little bit late.\u300d\u300cJob ascension? Should I help you?\u300d\u300cNo, this isn't a quest another person can help me with... Also, you still haven't gotten to 100. Right? Let's continue with our plans once we finish our respective job ascension quests.\u300d\u300cHmm... But if it's just leveling up, it won't take me long.\u300d\u300cNo, since the Close-Range Magician is also a hidden job, we don't know what kind of job ascension quest you'll get. It could take you long.\u300d\u300cThen I'll call you again after finishing the job ascension.\u300d\u300cIf you're bored, you can go to the duel arena or level up a little bit more.\u300d\u300cIt seems like it's going to take you a long time?\u300dHyun flinched at Ain's sharp question, so he thought about the answer carefully before replying.\u300cNot necessarily... But it could take me long if I'm unlucky.\u300d\u300cWell, I guess it doesn't matter since I can also do my job ascension quest.\u300dAin replied after remaining silent for a little while.'Okay, good!'After completing the preparations, Hyun told TarrTarr about the things they'd to do next.The goal of the quest was to infiltrate the Abyss.According to the Knight Commander Ollie, the place where the demon appeared was the 'Hates Valley.'It was one of the few places where humans lived that had sided with the Abyss.Although it was called a valley, in reality, it was a giant city where people that belonged to the Abyss roamed around.On the quest windows, all the missions were explained in great detail.[ - Once you reach the Hates Valley, go and look for the Abyss Repository. There, you'll be able to find the answer. ]- To enter the Abyss Repository, you'll need the permission of the dukes, so you'll probably have to enter the tournament that the Abyss organizes.TarrTarr became surprised after hearing Hyun's explanation.\"Eh?! We're going to infiltrate the Abyss?!\"\"Yes.\"\"But I belong to the Heavens?!\"\"I'm part of the Abyss.\"\"But I'm part of the Heaven's Forces! But wait... If you're part of the Abyss, how did you get in here?\"Because TarrTarr's voice was getting loud, Hyun covered his mouth.Thankfully, it seemed like there weren\u2019t any NPCs around.Before things got bigger, Hyun explained it to him.\"With this skill.\"Paf-Hyun scattered away into light and entered TarrTarr's body.Once they became one, he murmured with TarrTarr's voice.\"I was hiding in Ain's body.\"\"I see. But it's going to be impossible with me. Maybe things would be different if I could use \u00abAssimilation\u00bb. But even if you use \u00abAssimilation\u00bb on me, you won't be able to change the runes on my hands.\"\"What if I could?\"Hyun raised his hands.When he did that, it was TarrTarr's hands that were raised.\"Hmm...?\"TarrTarr was surprised after looking at the backs of his hands.There was a red rune burning in the place where blue lightning should be.What happened? Why had he suddenly become part of the Abyss?!Because TarrTarr was surprised, Hyun kept explaining.\"Since I'm part of the Abyss, I can change the runes as I wish.\"\"Oh... Then.\"\"Yes, as long as I don't \u00abDisassimilate\u00bb, you'll be able to enter the territory of the Abyss.\"Paf-\u00a0After Hyun <Disassimilated\u00bb, TarrTarr's rune turned back to the blue lightning that symbolized the Heavens.TarrTarr's eyes trembled slightly after he saw the runes change.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 - The Duke's Tournament (1)The Heavens and The Abyss\u2026As the world was split into two factions, users had to decide the faction with whom they would side.There was also the option of remaining neutral, but if you did that, you wouldn't be able to receive the bonus that each faction gave. So most users ended up choosing to side with either one of them.At first, the user's rate was about seven to three. But as time went on, the number of users that belonged to the Abyss went down, and the rate was at eight to two.The reason why most people chose the Heavens was because NPCs that belonged to that faction gave users a lot of support.Of course, there were also NPCs in the Abyss that gave you quests.But unlike the ones that belonged to the Heavens, who were very generous, the Abyss NPCs were quite picky regarding whom they gave their support.The most famous NPC that belonged to the Abyss was the Duke.The few users whom the Duke liked could receive support comparable to the ones that the Heavens gave.Although a Duke was one of the noble titles, one day, followers of the Abyss began calling themselves Dukes. That's why the meaning of that word had changed.Because of that, the title of Duke was no longer used in the Heavens.The word \u2018Duke\u2019 was used to describe people who had gained special powers after signing a contract with the devils.Although they were humans, those people had surpassed the limits of an average person, and thanks to that, they occupied an important place within the ranks of the Abyss.There were cases of NPCs who were a couple of hundred years old.And compared to demons or monsters, they were more generous to humans.The reason was that, from time to time, they gave their support to users.'It's gonna be okay if it goes according to the plan.'Hyun smiled after checking out the details of the quest.The system message asked him to reach the Abyss Repository.The Abyss Repository was a place that was normally forbidden to users. But if one had the support of the Duke, the story changed.That's right. The first step was getting close to the Duke.\"So this is the territory of the Abyss...\"\u300cYes, this is one of the few places where users that belong to the Abyss can step foot.\u300dHyun and TarrTarr were at the place called Hates Valley.It was a city that had two million people living in it. It was a place where people that belonged to the Abyss gathered in.TarrTarr looked around, surprised.\"This is unexpected.\"\u300cWhat?\u300d\"Because it's a territory that belongs to the Abyss, I was expecting it to be like a creepy ghost town, a place where at night zombies came out, or a place with people fighting the entire day... But this looks rather normal.\"\u300cI don't know about zombies... But there are indeed people fighting the entire day.\u300dWithout leaving time to enjoy the cityscape, Hyun kept walking toward somewhere.Because TarrTarr didn't have control priority, he moved along with Hyun.\"Where are we going?\"\u300cTo a place where there are fights all the time. It just happens to be today.\u300d[ <Search for the Traces of Evil> ]- You're lucky! There happens to be a festival in the Hates Valley!- Soon, the 4th tournament organized by the Duke will take place!- You must end within the top rankings! If the Duke recognizes you, maybe the road that leads to the Abyss Repository will open...?Hyun opened the quest window so that TarrTarr could also see it.The description of the quest had changed.Asrian's system told you about new milestones depending on the situation.Following each milestone was the normal way to clear a quest.\"Abyss Repository...?\"\u300cYes, but it isn't a place that can be accessed by most people.\u300dJust like the countries that belonged to the Heavens had their own social system, the ones that were part of the Abyss were also organized in a certain way.How were the people that belonged to the Abyss maintaining the order of such a big organization without showing themselves?One of the reasons was the existence of the Abyss Repository.Because the place was just like the heart of the Duke\u2019s holdings, its access was obviously forbidden to most users.\"Wouldn't it be easier to defeat the person guarding the Repository and infiltrate it?\"\u300cWhat kind of nonsense are you talking about...?\u300dHyun shook his head.\u300cDo you know what level the Dukes are? There's one whose level surpasses 400. That means he's at the same level as the Knight Commander who gave us the quest. Do you think we will be able to damage them at all?\u300d\"Not at all.\"After hearing that one of them was level 400, TarrTarr changed his opinion immediately.He had barely surpassed level 60, so they were at a level that couldn't even be compared to.\u300cWe must pass the test and get recognized by them.\u300d\"By whom?\"\u300cThe Dukes... Yes, to put it simply. The attention of the Dukes is focused on the few users that can pass the survival test.\u300d\"Eh, survival?\"\u300cYou don't need to be afraid. It's called survival, but in reality, no one dies. The tournament is also referred to as a festival.\u300d\"Oof, that's a relief.\"Both of them soon reached their destination.Around the old and luxurious tower, there was a line of users.After waiting five minutes, TarrTarr's turn finally came.It couldn't be seen from a distance, but as they got closer, they saw that there was a teleportation magic circle inside the tower.Someone with a black robe murmured after seeing TarrTarr.\"Did you come here to participate in the tournament?\"As he nodded, the other person said something more.\"The back of your hand.\"TarrTarr extended his arm.On the back of his hand, there was a fire symbolizing the Abyss.\"Okay, no problem. The cost is 50 gold.\"After receiving the money, the men lead them to the magic circle.As he started chanting, a dark veil that appeared from the magic circle devoured them.Suddenly, a completely different scenery was in front of them.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *[You've entered room 147!]It was an unfamiliar spacious place.With a notification message, TarrTarr appeared in that place.\"Another person came!\"\"He seems young.\"\"Hmm... From the gear, he seems to be around level 50. Not bad, but he isn't someone I should be wary about.\"\"More than that, for how long are we going to wait? It's already been a while!\"\"Shut up, Luke. It's going to start when the time comes...\"As he felt the people talking behind, TarrTarr's eyes widened as he began exploring the surroundings.What caught his attention first was a mana lamp that covered his entire field of vision.Fluorescent fires were hanging on the ceiling and walls.The fancy lights in a dark place made it look like an arcade.It was as if they were in a modern world rather than a fantasy one.\"Woah...!\"TarrTarr was in awe after finding another thing.In the corner of the place was a table that resembled one that you'd find in a bar.And on the other side of it, instead of alcohol bottles, he could see lots of different items.\"This is also part of the Asrian lore, right?\" TarrTarr murmured after looking at the modern furniture.There were many luxurious tables and chairs, and there were also many unknown magical circles placed.If Hyun had to pick somewhere similar to there, it would be the secret shop he'd gone to with Louise.TarrTarr tried to think of a similar place he knew of within his knowledge.\"This place... Looks like a club? And a very fancy one.\"\u300cHuh? How do you know that? Did you ever go to a club?\u300d\"Of course not, but I've seen many of them in movies.\"\u300cI guess that makes sense...?\u300dSuddenly, TarrTarr noticed something that was in the ceilings.\"Is that a CCTV?\"What TarrTarr's fingers pointed to was a crystal device that worked with magical power.That thing was rotating in all directions as if it were an eye.Hyun quickly lowered his hands.\u300cIt's something similar, while inside here, you won't be able to escape the sight of the Dukes.\u300d\"Ugh...!\"\u300cThey can also hear. So if it's something you don't want them to hear, say it via whisper.\u300d\u300cHow much free time do they have that they're doing stuff like this?\u300d\u300cDon't you think you'd develop weird hobbies if you spent a couple of hundred years in a gloomy place?\u300dThe waiting room was so big that it could comfortably host more than 500 people.The users around them were spending their free time on the sofas that were placed everywhere.The weird thing about the place was that there wasn't any sort of door or window.Basically, the room was perfectly enclosed.\u300cRest for a little bit. It's going to start soon.\u300dHyun placed TarrTarr's body on a sofa.He glanced at the electric sign on the wall.[ <Currently, there are '146923' users participating!> ]<Remaining time before the tournament starts: 314 seconds>At the top of the lobby, the number of people participating was displayed.\u300cThe number of users seems to be over a hundred thousand, yet there doesn't seem to be many people around us. Why's that?\u300dHyun immediately replied to TarrTarr's question.\u300cRealistically, there's no way they'd put so many people in one place... Since this place is virtual, they can create thousands of these simultaneously. You go to school, right? Think of it as a classroom that has a certain number of students.\u300d\"Looking for a party. I'm a level 53 Warrior!\"\"Do you want to join us? Someone couldn't come, and we're currently at three!\"Before the tournament started, there were lots of people searching for partners.But no one approached the young-looking TarrTarr. On top of his age, his items didn't seem good, either.A few moments later, all users focused their attention in one place.A voice came out from the speakers that worked with magical power located throughout the room, and a screen that resembled those of a movie theater\u2019s covered the stage.[ <The 4th Tournament is Starting!> ]A red fluorescent text appeared.A creepy sound came out every time a letter appeared on the screen.[ - Anyone can have the honor of becoming a Duke's attendant as long as you can stand out! ]- There are '151,831' users that were gathered to receive the affection of the Dukes!<Number of people participating in the 4th Tournament: 151,831>\"Ugh... A lot of people came.\"\"Doesn't it seem like the number of people participating increases each time?\"\"I guess this means that the number of people confident in their skills has increased significantly.\"As the number of people participating appeared, the room became noisy.The explanation on the screen kept going on despite that.[ - Sadly, not everyone will receive the affection of the Dukes. You'll receive the treatment you deserve based on your results. ]<Rewards of the 4th Duke's Tournament>1 ~ 10th place: Duke's Affection.

(Y/N)>\"No.\"Hyun quickly answered.TarrTarr speaking could cause him trouble.[ <Are you within the top 1000 places in the Hall of Fame? (Y/N)> ]<Last question. Is there any transcendent, either an angel or a demon, that recognizes you? (Y/N)>\"Yes...\"Hyun thought about about that question.If what he saw in that video was true, and Louise was indeed an angel... And if she still remembered him, this should be the correct answer.[Checking out the world's principle of causality...][It turned out to be true!][You've received an extra 1000 points!]Slide-Suddenly, lots of coins began falling from an empty place that opened in the air.Hyun was surprised by it and began looking around.By how no one else reacted, it seemed only he could see the falling coins.Hyun kept looking at the golden coins falling from the sky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 - The Duke's Tournament (2)After a while, all the coins disappeared and were replaced by a message.[You've gained 1000 points!][The points are a special currency that can be used in the tournament! Don't spend them too carelessly!]Once all the choices ended, a few more coins came out of the air.It was at that moment that everyone else started murmuring.All the other users were looking at their feet, just like Hyun had just done.After looking at them, Hyun confirmed that everyone else was experimenting with the same thing as him.[You've received 100 points!][Current Points: 1100p][You can check your current ranking in the status window.]As the screen changed, just like the hall of fame, the rankings of everyone appeared from the number one.As countless IDs appeared, many people sighed.TarrTarr was also surprised.\u300cI'm... 21...?\u300dHis ID was on the top.Although it was a joint 21st place.\u300cThe current rankings are pointless.\u300d\u300cIs that so...?\u300d\u300cEveryone with 1100 points is probably seeing themself at the 21st position.\u300dJust like Hyun said, most users had, at the moment, either 100, 1100, or 2100 points.But in a few moments, the rankings would start changing quickly as if it were the stock market.There was no point in thinking about the rankings yet.[ -\u00a0 Then, the 4th Duke's Tournament is going to start! ]<Remaining Time: 180 minutes>Wham-!As the tournament began, an entire wall lifted, and a place that had been hidden showed itself.The new place that appeared was bigger than the waiting room.Even Hyun, who had experienced and enjoyed many large-scale things while playing Asra, was mesmerized for a moment.He had never been to that place, but he'd seen it a couple of times in movies.'A casino? Suddenly?'That was the first word that came to his mind.Hyun knew about the Abyss's quests only by rumors he'd heard or from information he'd gotten, but he had never experienced them.Asrian's detailed production excited him as if he'd come to a real casino.'I see. This is why they said that the points are the currency.'It seemed like the coins that fell like a waterfall were chips you could use in the casino.Hyun, who had understood the concept of the tournament, smiled.'Yes, I'm finally getting a grasp of things!'After a while, TarrTarr, who had finally come back to his senses, asked.\u300cHmm... What should we do first?\u300d\u300cHuh? You should prepare to record, obviously.\u300d\u300cOh yeah, that's right. Record...\u300dHyun slowly walked through the corridor.Tens of magic circles were next to each other as if they were an arcade attraction.And just like a real casino, there were also some NPCs working as 'dealers.'Hyun quickly looked around the entire place.From what he knew, each magic circle led them to one virtual quest.Basically, where the tournament took place was a game center where many games were gathered.Depending on your results, you could either gain or lose points.You could also get quests as a party or alone.There were raids where tens of people collaborated.In some of them, a special rule even allowed PvP!There were many interesting things to see, but there was no time to waste.After all, there was a time limit of three hours.'Is it this way?'Hyun quickly walked toward the one he'd decided on previously.Where Hyun stopped was a place where it said 'Virtual Historical Battle.'The magic circle was decorated as a slot machine. Even Hyun, who had no experience with that kind of thing, quickly learned how to operate it.A hologram with a simple explanation appeared in front of them.[ <Virtual Historical Battle (1 person)> ]Difficulty: [Easy], [Normal], [Hard]Betting Limits: Depending on difficulty 1 ~ 20p / 10 ~ 100p / 50 ~ 500p\u300cWoah! Do we have to gamble? It's my first time doing it! I somehow feel we're doing something wrong, making things more exciting!\u300dTarrTarr was excited since that was the first time he'd experienced coming to a casino.\u300cBut are we going to be okay? My parents always say that you're always going to lose while gambling.\u300d\u300cIt's going to be okay,\u300dHyun said while smiling.\u300cWhat your parents are talking about is about real gambling... But here, we're guaranteed to win.\u300dHyun walked toward the magic circle and said something more.\u300cThis is a gamble where skills matter.\u300dAfter exchanging 500 points with chips in an exchange center around there, Hyun put them all in a device that looked like a slot machine.He bet the maximum amount possible on the highest difficulty.As TarrTarr was surprised by Hyun's confidence, he said while smiling.\u300cIf you're sure you're going to win, wouldn't it be better to bet the maximum possible amount? You just need to think about how to record and edit the footage.\u300dWhile Hyun made that affirmation, a message appeared.[You've chosen the difficulty!][Select the 'theme' of the stage!]Many monsters appeared as small holograms in front of them.What Hyun picked was a skeleton that was cutely drawn as a caricature.[You've picked the 'undead invasion'!][The stage will soon begin! Three, Two, One\u2026]At the same time he picked, the count down began.A virtual fight was about to start in a virtual reality game.Suddenly, Hyun's, no, TarrTarr's body was standing on top of a fortress that had become ruins.\u300cThis...\u300d\u300cYes, it's a game inside a game.\u300dAs he turned his head around, he saw a group of injured soldiers repairing the fortress's walls.The place was probably a battlefield.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *A message began explaining the context of the battle.<Warning!

I'll help you.\"\"Don't come near. I don't need your help!\"\"What\u2026?\"The soldier thought for a moment that he had misheard.No, he had definitely misheard.He was about to approach the kid who was struggling with a weak soldier, when\u2026\"Woah\u2026!\"He backed off at the sight of Hyun, who had swiped off the weapon.\"Just leave this side alone.\"Hyun was starting to get angry at the random guy who was bothering him while he was trying to stack combos.\"Attacking an ally, what are you thinking?!\"The soldier who had gotten tired shouted, but the boy just stood still.Just as if he were a sculptor, he kept hitting the skeleton with an old dagger.\"Is he just someone crazy...?\"The soldier who had concluded that returned to his position while tilting his head.But as Hyun continued doing his work, the rest of the soldiers began to notice him.Some of them were starting to get angry at Hyun.Everyone was fighting while risking their lives, yet he was just playing in the middle of that situation!But unlike what they thought, Hyun was more serious than anyone else.\u300cIt seems like the people around us are angry...\u300d\u300cYeah, they probably are.\u300dEven if everyone looked at him angrily, Hyun didn't seem to care.Hyun could ignore the rest and did what he wanted because he was sure of himself.[For the next 5 minutes, you won't be able to gain combos from Infiltration Skeleton Soldiers!]\"Stop doing useless things and fight properly! Can't you see that everyone is fighting while bleeding?!\"A soldier who was tired walked toward them.He was approaching TarrTarr while warning him for doing what he wanted, separated from the rest.Clang-!The soldier approaching TarrTarr while menacing him collapsed while grabbing his tingling hand.Hyun had swung his sword while suddenly turning around.The soldier lost the weapon because of an impact he wasn't expecting.\"I'm going to help you soon, so wait,\" Hyun said while looking at the soldier on the floor.As their eyes met, the soldier took a deep breath.What he saw were incredibly cold eyes.Not only that, but the speed at which he changed weapons was so fast that he couldn't see it.\"If you're so strong... Why aren't you helping?\"The soldier who had lost his weapon asked him while lifting his head.Just one confrontation was enough to know.That person was at least twice as strong as him, no, even more than that!The strength of the impact was because of the effect of \u00abTrance\u00bb, which increased the attack as the number of combos increased, but because the soldier's level was low, he didn't know that.\"Tsk, leave that guy alone!\"\"The Duke has promised to come to help us. We just have to join our strengths and resist the best we can!\"As time passed, the number of skeletons climbing the wall increased.One or two became three and four. The soldiers were starting to struggle.\"Ugh... It's hard to resist!\"\"We're going to be annihilated before the Duke comes to help!\"In the end, one of the walls ended up collapsing.Suddenly, skeletons entered the fortress and surrounded some of the soldiers.\"Diorite! Can you sneak out?!\"\"Just give up! If you enter there, we're also going to get surrounded!\"About twenty soldiers were left. They gave up on the fortress's wall and were moved to a place where they would be able to defend easily.The eyes of the surrounded soldier showed despair.At that moment\u2026\"He can be saved.\"Someone suddenly passed through next to them while mumbling.Everyone's attention got focused on that someone.It was that guy\u2026The crazy guy who had been doing nonsensical things was running alone toward the army of the undead to save an ally who was in trouble.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 - The Duke's Tournament (3)\"What\u2026?\"The soldiers couldn't believe what they were seeing.The sight of skeletons collapsing every time the boy swung his sword didn't seem real.One hit, one kill!Even if they tried with all their strength, they needed at least 10 cuts to defeat an opponent, so they couldn't understand why the undead couldn't withstand those light-looking attacks.The reason was that Hyun had surpassed a thousand combos.That was the power of a combo Thief that had learned \u00abTrance\u00bb.[Only attacks faster than 0.8 seconds will count towards the combo!]Hyun could feel his body getting faster.With so many opponents, he didn't have to worry about the combo being cut short.Paf-!As the two swords flashed, the skeletons that were surrounding the soldier became dust and scattered away.The eyes of the soldier that was saved met TarrTarr's.\"Th-thank you...\"He was the soldier who had accused Hyun just a few moments before of being crazy.Hyun spoke to him as the man seemed to be feeling a mixture of emotions containing regret, gratitude, and shame.\"Don't get far away. It's dangerous.\"That soldier, who had been close to dying, seemed to be getting hope from Hyun's words.It wouldn't be an exaggeration to call him a savior. Hyun was cutting the skeletons that were climbing the walls at an incredible speed. Not only that, but he immediately leaped toward another soldier who was in danger.For some reason, the soldier\u2019s eyes teared up.'There are too many dangerous places.'Hyun looked around while helping the soldiers who were in danger.The walls of the fortress had been completely destroyed. The battle wasn't simply about defending the fortress anymore. It was slowly becoming more complex.The reason was that all the defending walls had suddenly collapsed.The soldiers tried to hold while forming a circle.Hyun alone was running in the outskirts while reducing the number of undead monsters.1280 combo! 1291 combo!As TarrTarr's swords started to get faster, more and more undead monsters began gathering.\"A knight\u2026?\"Someone murmured after seeing Hyun fighting a horde of undead.Yes, if he wasn't a knight of the Duke, it wouldn\u2019t make sense that he had so much power!Only after a while, the soldiers started to wonder about Hyun's identity\u2014and that seemed to be the most reasonable explanation.\"The knight is supporting us\u2026!\"\"Yes, the Duke hasn't abandoned us! He sent us the knight before he arrived!\"The soldiers didn't find out that TarrTarr's level was similar to theirs because they were low-level soldiers who didn't know about the \u00abcombo\u00bb skill.Those that had accused Hyun were feeling ashamed.They had bashed the knight without knowing his true intentions!They felt ashamed for having talked without properly knowing about the situation.[ <Time before the Duke arrives: 239 seconds> ]Hyun didn't have time to think about what the soldiers were saying.He just kept slashing the necks of the undead, broke their bones, and cut their souls!The number of combos began increasing faster.But it wasn't still enough to face the army of undead that were flocking like ants.'Switch.'Hyun sheathed TarrTarr's two short swords.And he took out a sword that was over two meters long.A sword that was even taller than TarrTarr appeared.Claymore\u2026The two-handed sword wasn't a weapon that matched a Thief.Although its attack range was bigger, you became slower. And thus, taking advantage of the Thief's speed became more difficult. Of course, that was disadvantageous if you wanted to accumulate combos.Even so, Hyun had prepared that sword just in case.In case something like this happened!Clink-!As he swung the sword, he cut through every opponent in front of him.With just one attack, he defeated five undead, and with that, he gained five extra combo counts.'Just like I thought, one hit is enough!'Hyun yelled for joy inside.The things he'd prepared for the tournament were working.Because he had surpassed two thousand combos, that giant sword had become the perfect weapon to annihilate the army of undead.Slash-!As he swung the sword, everything around was cut.All of the undead within the attack range of the sword turned into dust while making chilling screams.Even though the movements were big, they weren't slow.It was thanks to the increased speed obtained by accumulating lots of combos.The look of TarrTarr wielding Claymore freely made him look like a Knight who had received a buff in wind-type attacks.'The doesn't seem to be an end to this.'Boo- Booo-White ghosts began flying while crying loudly.Sometimes there were some horrible-smelling zombies and ghouls mixed with the skeletons.As time went on, stronger undead started to appear.The zombies aimed to do a surprise attack, and the ghosts were roaming around in the air, targetting the human's heads.From time to time, an arrow from a skeleton archer came flying through.\"Ugh...!\"The sword of a skeleton penetrated the chest of a soldier.The rusty sword had completely penetrated his body.\"Hans, no!\"The moment the sword pierced his chest, the soldier died.Thud-His body didn't disappear; it just remained there on the floor.After seeing him die, the remaining soldiers thought of the same thing.One of them could be the next one to die.\"There are too many enemies!\"\"Mr. Knight, when is the rest of the support coming?!\"\"Let's try to resist a little bit more!\"The last person that spoke was Hyun.It was a quest that recreated a historical battle.The only ones that could see the remaining time were Hyun and TarrTarr, both users.[ <Time before the Duke arrives: 103 seconds> ]The number of incoming undead had increased.Even if he cut five enemies simultaneously, that place was soon covered by other ones.The dead monsters\u2019 bodies were already taller than a soldier, and a disgusting smell was coming from them.[3052 combo! You've achieved a new record!]The speed at which Hyun defeated the undead monsters had increased, but the rate at which new ones appeared was even faster.\"Coff...!\"Another soldier fell.But no one seemed disturbed after seeing that.No, they didn't have time to see it. They just felt that death was near.They didn't have time to relax. Being sad was a luxury at that moment.[ <Time before the Duke arrives: 50 seconds>\u00a0 ]It was at that moment that Hyun heard a cry that made him feel as if his heart was about to sink.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Booooooo-!Two 'Black Ghosts' had appeared and were rushing toward the middle of the fortress.'That\u2026!'The moment he saw the two monsters emitting chilling energy, he immediately stood in front of the soldiers and shouted.\"Everyone, stand behind me!\"The soldiers also felt their hearts sink as they saw the black figures getting closer.If they come face to face with those, they'd surely die!Their survival instincts were sending them a warning.The soldiers who felt danger approaching started to move immediately.'I need a light weapon!'Hyun quickly changed his weapon to the pair of short swords.Vroom-!A dark energy brushed past his hair.The elite black ghost's instant kill attack\u2026But it didn't hit him.Hyun knew all their attack patterns.After dodging the attack, Hyun cut one of the two ghosts\u2019 necks with both hands. It scattered into the air with a horrible scream.'One more!'There was another ghost left.The robe of the remaining ghost began fluttering.Tens of dark knives came flying in his direction in a second!But even those weren't able to touch Hyun.He could dodge the because he knew their patterns, but from the soldier's perspective, they looked like movements that were far above the level of a human.The look of Hyun dealing with overwhelmingly strong monsters looked like a knight that appeared in myths.[4000 combo! You've obtained the achievement \u2018Reality of the Sword God\u2019!][Your Agility has increased by 1!]\"Ugh!\"An arrow struck one of the soldiers in the head, and he collapsed on the floor.After that, he was attacked by the undead around, and his body was disfigured.\"Ugh...! Let me go!\"A ghost had grabbed a soldier by the neck and was taking him up.The ghost threw him right in the middle of the undead. Everyone could imagine what was about to become of him.Ting-!The notification window changed after five soldiers had lost their lives.[ <Time before the Duke arrives: 0 seconds> ][You've successfully cleared the highest difficulty of the undead defense!][Oops, it seems like the Duke had to attend a very important event today, so he won't be able to get here!][If you're lucky, the Duke will revive you as an undead, so don't lose hope.]* Hint: The time you can resist will greatly influence the number of points you'll receive!Hyun smiled bitterly.'As expected, this is how it's gonna be done.'When the quest started, there was a part that had said that the extra time resisted will count towards the number of points gained.The moment he read those words, a thought had crossed his mind.Was it possible that the Duke wouldn't appear even after the quest\u2019s time was over?Hyun's prediction was right.The window that showed the remaining time had been replaced with another thing.[ <Extra Points: x1.12> ]- As time goes on, the number of extra points obtained will increase.\"When is the Duke going to come!\"'He's not coming...'Hyun couldn't answer that.After looking at the undead that were slowly approaching them, Hyun sighed.Bones that emitted blue light\u2026A small skeleton who was wearing a robe\u2026'A lich came?'Only one lich had appeared.Although it may not look that menacing, its appearance in the battle was basically as if death itself had appeared.Even in Asra, the lich was among the most bothersome monsters.Whir-A dark energy began spreading as the lich pointed its wand to the front.The bodies of the undead touched by that dark energy were revived.And the place where there were the most amount of corpses\u2026!It was the place where the soldiers were standing while forming a circle.\"Argh!\"As tens of monsters were suddenly revived, two soldiers that became isolated screamed.As the horde of undead swallowed their colleagues, no one had a way to know if they'd died or not.\"Ugh\u2026 This is hell!\"\"Did the Duke abandon us\u2026?\"As countless reviving lights began rising from everywhere, the soldiers started to die one after the other.Only three soldiers, Hyun included, were left alive when the lich's mana plummeted.<Extra Points: x3.15>\"Ugh!\"\"Redment? Did you die?!\"\"Mr. Knight...\"As Redment was devoured by the undead, only Hyun and another soldier were left alive.It seemed he was in shock after losing all his colleagues. His hands weren't moving.\"Isn't the Duke going to come?\" He asked Hyun with eyes that showed he'd lost all his hope after looking at the corpses of his deceased colleagues.Clang-!Only the sound of Hyun fighting against the countless undead echoed through the battlefield.\"This\u2026 Is a tragedy.\"After saying that, the last remaining soldier grabbed the sword and pointed it toward himself.The sword penetrated his stomach and emerged out of his back.Even if there wasn't blood on the sword, it was still a shocking scene.\"Huh\u2026?!\"Not only TarrTarr, but Hyun was also surprised by what happened.'An NPC committed suicide\u2026?'Even Hyun, who had played Asra for 8 years, had never seen anything like that.Of course, even back then, the NPCs had an intelligence comparable to a human's. But it was the first time he had seen one acting in such a human way.Was it that he hadn't noticed the expressions in Asra because the graphics weren't so detailed?'What the\u2026?'Hyun could feel his heart beating faster.No, maybe that was how TarrTarr was feeling?

You've received 99835 points!][Since you've successfully cleared it, you won't be able to challenge the same theme again!]* * *The first combat was over.TarrTarr's body had returned to the tournament arena.Hyun was immersed in his thoughts while the results were being calculated.The title \u201cVirtual Historical Battle\u201d was, as the name indicated, virtual.Even if he knew that, Hyun was still shocked by what he'd seen.An NPC had committed suicide.Before the undead could devour him, he had chosen to take his life.How close were the NPCs to real humans?Was that also a difference between Asra and Asrian?TarrTarr's voice woke Hyun, who was deeply immersed in his own thoughts.\u300cWhat's happening...?\u300dOn the ceiling and all the walls, there was the number 77777 showing, and a celebration broke out.TarrTarr, who was just looking around dumbfounded, came back to his senses after looking at the sudden messages that appeared.[You've set a new record in the Virtual Historical Battle!][You've obtained a lucky chip!][You can exchange the lucky chip for 77777 points!]While reading the message, TarrTarr finally understood what all that commotion was about.The reason behind all that commotion was them.\"What? Who got a jackpot?\"All the users around them stopped what they were doing and gathered around the virtual historical battle magic circle.What they saw there was a shockingly high score.\"Someone broke Lattice's record?\"After someone shouted that, everyone's attention got focused on the leaderboard.The ID in 1st place was an unfamiliar one.1st place. TarrTarr: 99835 points - Defend against undead (57 seconds ago)2nd place. Lattice: 71619 points - Royal Castle Invasion (9 days ago)3rd place. Flame Hell: 58194 points - Immortal Knight (3 days ago)\u2026\"TarrTarr?\"After looking at the rankings, everyone tilted their heads.TarrTarr, who had barely reached level 70, wasn't a ranker in the Hall of Fame. Not only that, he wasn't even a Grand Master in PvP. He was just an average user.It would be normal if no one knew about him.But that wasn't the case.Someone shouted while pointing at the ID.\"Huh? I've seen that name somewhere before!\"\"Yeah, me too!\"Channel TarrTarr.Some people in the tournament arena had seen the video he had uploaded.\"What? Was he a famous player? No wonder\u2026\"\"Yet\u2026 From what I remember from the video, he seemed to have good skills. But I didn't know he was this good.\"\"Maybe\u2026 is defend against the undead easier to get points than the other ones...?\"\"Still, getting to the 1st place is amazing.\"At that moment, Hyun and TarrTarr didn't know that the video they uploaded was getting much attention.The reason was simple.It took time for the video to spread through the communities of other countries.Even in the Korean communities, it took TarrTarr's video a while before it became popular.But as time went on, views started to come. And it went from ten thousand to a million views in just a few hours.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The Duke's tournament was an event that gathered the interest of both Abyss and Heaven's users.The scale and content were enough to capture the attention of users.It didn't take long before the news that someone had beaten Lattice's record spread.The scoreboard had been shown through streams or some users who were taking part in the tournament.Just at that moment, TarrTarr's video began to get some momentum.The hot topic in the communities was that a user appeared on both sides.As the video became famous and TarrTarr's name became a hot topic again, all communities became flooded.<The Appearance of a New Master?><Is a Scouting War Between Top Guilds going to start?>News about TarrTarr had surpassed the communities and was also being covered on game-related websites.Arneng\u2026He was the one who had given TarrTarr some advice in regards to YouTube. He couldn't hide his surprise while watching the current situation unfold.\"What's happening...? It seems somewhat wrong...\"Arneng watched TarrTarr's video only after it had become a hot issue and was very surprised by it.He couldn't forget the scene of that guy hunting skeletons with a godly level of control.He even wondered if that really was TarrTarr.It was as if he was a completely different person.It was understandable for him to react like that since he didn't know about \u00abAssimilation\u00bb.\"What are you doing while going around...?\"It didn't matter how much he thought about it or how many times he watched it\u2014he couldn't come up with an answer.While feeling astonished, Arneng kept reading different threads on the community boards.* * *\"We must incorporate him, no matter what. This time, we mustn't fail.\"The guild leader, XL, said to the rest with a serious look on his face.They were also eyeing the new emerging figure TarrTarr.People from Darkness had begun considering Ain two steps more dangerous than they'd first thought.That day, Mayday looked as if she was about to cry. And the guild leader, XL, started to reconsider his evaluation of the top users.\"If we can incorporate TarrTarr, we should be able to mitigate the error of losing her.\"\"Sorry...\"Pias, who was next to him, looked depressed.After all, because of him, they'd become enemies with Ain.He never thought that being unable to suppress the feeling of shame would bring such results.\"It's okay. We cannot do anything about the past. We just have to do things right this time.\"\"Did you say that his ID is TarrTarr? Since he broke Lattice's record, I guess he will surely enter the top 10.\"Bearshield picked up on the important point.Because of how popular the Duke's tournament was, many people were currently streaming it.From what they could see, he currently had almost 100 thousand points!There was almost no chance of someone taking the number one position from him.That meant that he was for sure going to receive the biggest reward. The 'invitation.'\"Once the tournament is over, I guess he will also participate in the banquet. Let's approach him there.\"\"So the banquet is where the battle will take.\"They were always the first to jump into the recruitment competition, which was also why they'd managed to maintain the first position in the rankings.XL's sixth sense was telling him something.If they lost him, they could end up losing the crown for the first time.* * *Berard\u2026He was a veteran who had once reached 5th place in the rankings on Asra.He had gotten to know TarrTarr because of the day\u2019s incident. After watching the video on TarrTarr's channel, he couldn't hide his surprise.\"Who's this?\"He remembered the name of the most famous users of the previous game, but among them, there wasn't anyone with the ID TarrTarr.But from what he'd seen in the video, that guy was using techniques that only a few Asra rankers were able to do.\"Can... You do that?\"Steel Rock, who was next to him watching the video asked him.Even though he had also played the previous game, since his rank wasn't that high, he couldn't make a correct judgment.\"I'm not a combo Thief...\"\"Then if you change your skills to a combo one, could you do it?\"\"I probably couldn\u2019t. Although those look easy, they aren't things that you can easily do, even with lots of practice.\"\"Then... Does that mean that this guy is the 2nd Lattice?\"When they saw Lattice's growth rate, there was something they wondered about.Was he an Asra Online user?But after investigating, they concluded that he wasn't.He had been able to reach that place thanks to his talent, luck, and money.Was TarrTarr that kind of player?\"Maybe he's on an even higher level.\"\"What?\"Berard began explaining.\"From what I've seen, that guy is level 70. He achieved a hundred thousand points on the Virtual Historical Battle with low specs and non-special items. Do you think that is even possible?\"\"What, level 70...?!\"\"Yes, it doesn't make sense. He's going to be someone dangerous if he becomes our enemy. He's already crazy good. I don't want to imagine how much better he will become once he grows.\"Everyone could see TarrTarr's information with just a simple search.Although his ID wasn't in the hall of fame, his overall ranking appeared.A level 70 Thief. With a PvP ranking of Master.But those pieces of information were worthless.Maybe he had begun playing Asrian late. Or perhaps he still hadn't shown his true abilities.\"Why is his level so low? Did he start playing late?\"\"That's probably the reason. But the talent is real. I wouldn't be surprised if he becomes a ranker by next week.\"\"This reminds me of someone,\" Steel Rock said while laughing in disbelief.Why was it that he thought of that name?\"Are you talking about Hyun?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 - What's Hidden in the Tournament Arena (2)\"Yes, is there a possibility that TarrTarr is Hyun?\"Berard thought for a little while, but it didn't take him long to come up with an answer.\"I think that probability is low. If Hyun were playing Asrian, he would have probably started from day one. If he's at level 70 at this point, he isn't Hyun.\"\"Yeah. Not only that, but he also seems very young. Just because he's wearing a mask doesn't mean he can hide his age. Hyun played the previous game for eight years, right?\"\"Yes. That's why we must bring him to our side.\"\"TarrTarr? But he wasn't an Asra user.\"\"That doesn't matter.\"Berard and Steel Rock were part of a guild that had gathered old Asra users.It was a guild you couldn't join if you had no experience in Asra.Although, at the moment, they were moving quietly while maintaining a low profile, Berard thought that even the number one guild, Darkness, was below them.But what if they could incorporate TarrTarr?Even in the previous game, those two were the biggest obstacle.With TarrTarr, maybe they would be able to face them.* * *'Are they going to be okay?'Hyun looked at the users with worrying eyes.After he established a new record in the 'Virtual Historical Battle' with undead as the theme, the number of users that picked the same mission increased significantly.'The missions that have undead as enemies are especially bothersome...'He had chosen undead because it was the best way to use TarrTarr's skill at its fullest, not because it was easy.The fact they weren't afraid of dying was great to stack combos.But that was also what was scary about them.He was sure there wouldn't be many users capable of dealing with a horde of skeletons attacking aggressively.'Well, I guess that isn't something I should be worried about.'He currently had a hundred thousand points.He was ranked first.But he had no intentions of being satisfied with that.'I guess I can move on to the next stage of my plan.'Because the tournament was created with a casino as a theme, there were a wide variety of installations.Hyun went to a bar that was in the corner of the room.There wasn't anyone except for the bartender inside the shop.It was obvious.There probably weren't many people willing to spend the time drinking alcohol in the middle of a tournament with a time limit.'What are you going to order?' The bartender asked him as soon as he took a seat.Despite TarrTarr's young look, the bartender offered him a drink without doubting for a moment.\"Give me the most expensive one.\"\"If it's the most expensive... I recommend the 'Pitch Black Frenzy.' It costs 500 points.\"\"Give me that.\"While TarrTarr was looking dumbfounded, Hyun had finished ordering.After the drink came out, he drank it at once.\"One more...\"\u300cWhat are you doing? Just because we've earned some points, we mustn't waste them!\u300d\u300cWho said it was over? We're just getting started.\u300d\u300cThat's what I'm saying! It isn't even tasty... No, that's not the issue here...\u300d\u00abAssimilation\u00bb made you share the senses, so they could also taste what the other person was eating or drinking.From a certain point of view, it was as if Hyun was forcing TarrTarr to drink alcohol.\u300cI can't believe one cup is 500 points... You remember that we only had 1100 points at the beginning, right?\u300d\u300cBe quiet. These are the points I earned.\u300dHyun brushed off TarrTarr's complaints.Because what Hyun said was true, TarrTarr kept watching quietly.'How much is he planning to drink?'In just an instant, he'd spent 2000 points.As expected, was gambling all about earning a lot and spending it as if it were nothing?The number of points was a lot, but TarrTarr felt tortured because he also had to feel the bitter taste of alcohol.'This isn't even tasty...'\u300cUgh... It really tastes horrible.\u300d\u300cThen why did you...!\u300dIt was at that moment\u2026Ting-!After Hyun had drunk five cups, he received a system message.[You've spent 2500 points!][You've become the 21st VIP member of the 'Darkness's Rest Area.']'Huh? VIP?'While TarrTarr was confused by the sudden message that had appeared, he could hear the bartender's voice.\"It seems like you really like this place. I'd like to present other items if you're okay with it.\"\"Ugh... Of course,\u00a0cough.\"\"Oh, then I'll get you the list!\"Tap!As the bartender flicked his finger, a shop interface appeared in front of Hyun.Amazingly, the items that appeared on the list weren't alcohol or food.They were items.Although they had a duration of three hours, there were even uniques!At first glance, one may think that the user's specs would determine the results of the survival test, but that wasn't exactly the truth.In that place, there were many ways to reduce the gap in the specs.Secret market, auction place, gambling, etc.That bar was also one of the hidden secrets of this tournament arena.The bartender had said that TarrTarr had become the 21 VIP member, which meant that there were other users who knew about that place through the previous game.\u300cWoah... So they sell these types of weapons.\u300dTarrTarr's mouth was agape.\u300cThey're all unique items! The price is also very cheap!\u300d\u300cBut you can't take them outside.\u300dIt was just as Hyun said.All items here were single-use only.Once the tournament ended, they would be destroyed.TarrTarr was disappointed after hearing that you could only use the items in the tournament.\u300cDo we need to buy them? As long as we get into the top 10, we're going to be able to receive the recognition of the Dukes. I believe that we already have enough points.\u300d\u300cYeah, that's true. We're not going to buy any of these things.\u300dIt was just as TarrTarr said.But that place had another secret.One that not even Asra veterans knew about.Hyun took out the lucky coin and gave it to the bartender.\"Oh, that?!\"The bartender's eyes shook after looking at the rainbow light emanating from the chip.More than surprise, in his expression, there was happiness and expectations.\"Lucky Chip...! Are you going to give me this?\"\"Yes, it's a tip.\"The bartender seemed worried for a moment, but soon, his expression changed for a smile.\"Then I just can't stay still while doing nothing. I promise to give you the best possible treatment I can.\"[You've become the first VVIP client of Darkness's Rest Area!][You've received 50000p as a bonus for being the first member!][Exclusive VVIP items had been added to the list!]A smile appeared on TarrTarr's face.It was Hyun's smile, who was using \u00abAssimilation\u00bb.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *'There was no way another user knew about the conditions of becoming a VVIP member.'After all, that was information he'd gotten from the Heaven's 'Interloop'!The only user in Asra who had access to that place was him.'I'm glad I searched before coming.'Before Asrian opened, Hyun had spent many hours in the Interloop.It was a place that had lots of information about Asrian's vast world and history.There was so much information in the Interloop that, even if you had many years, you wouldn't be able to read it all.But he only had five days.Hyun had taken a screenshot of all the information he considered as important.Luckily, among those, there was information about the tournament.The Darkness's Rest Area and VVIP members were among those.TarrTarr's eyes widened after reading the new items that had appeared.\u300cWhat's this. There's a legendary category?\u300d\u300cWhat are you talking about? It's obviously the next category after unique. Although it doesn't change the fact that they're single-use only.\u300dOn the VVIP member list, there weren't only weapons. There was also a wide variety of items.There were also some items that could be useful if used correctly.[Point Bag (XL)]- There's a random amount of points between 10 ~ and 5000.- They'll get destroyed 10 minutes after the 4th tournament ends.- The probability of getting a high number of points is low!

But now, he'd seen a way to do it.After reading TarrTarr's thoughts, Hyun quickly said.\u300cDon't even think of asking me to buy that.\u300d\u300cR... Right?\u300d\u300cObviously, we still have many things to buy.\u300dTarrTarr tilted his head.\u300cIs there a need to buy something? We're already ranked 1st.\u300d\u300cLook at this.\u300dHyun used TarrTarr's fingers to go down through the interface.The lower they went, the more expensive things became.The moment they reached the bottom, an item with golden letters appeared.\u300cAt the bottom of the VVIP shop, there's this item\u2026\u300d\u300cSoul Replication Elixir\u300d- You can generate a 2nd skill tree slot permanently.- Each slot consumes skill points separately.(Price: 2.5 million points)'Hmm?'TarrTarr thought he'd seen wrong.After coming back to his senses, more than surprised, he seemed annoyed.\u300cThere's a weird item at the bottom.\u300d\u300cA weird item?\u300d\u300cThey've placed an item that one won't be able to buy. As if they were bragging about it. The effect also is just too much.\u300d\u300cWho said that you can't buy it?\u300dFufu... After noticing that Hyun was smiling, TarrTarr asked.\u300cAre you really thinking of buying it?\u300d\u300cAlthough it's a lot... Maybe I'll be able to do it before the tournament ends.\u300dBefore starting to play Asrian, Hyun had thought of a few things he had to get no matter what.In this game, there were some items, titles, and skills with an outstanding effect.When should he obtain what?If the title 'heavenly being' was the first one, that elixir was the second.'If, with the same points, I can have two different skill sets... The possible skill combinations increase by more than ten times!'Its worth was probably more than a legendary or epic item.2.5 million points may seem unreasonable for an average user. But for him, it wasn't.'Should I get going?'Hyun bought \u2018Trick\u2019 and modified the points so it would look like he had just around 100 thousand.From then on, he had to move carefully.Then he began spending the rest of the points as he had originally planned.[Hell Difficulty Ticket]- You can unlock a new difficulty of the Virtual Historical Battle.(Price: 3000 points)He bought three copies of that item.He still had many points left.The next step was getting the best items possible.After all, challenging the hell difficulty with TarrTarr's specs was like committing suicide.[Dagger of a Mythical Assassin][Armor of a Mythical Assassin][Ring of a Mythical Assassin]...Hyun used all the points to buy the legendary set item of the Mythical Assassin.They were automatically placed on TarrTarr's body the moment he bought them.Individually, the set items of the Mythical Assassin weren't impressive. But once you gathered all 6 pieces, it had an effect so great that it went against common sense.A dark energy surrounded TarrTarr and then entered his body.He felt his body getting lighter.\u2014It was because his stats had increased a lot.'Let's get started.'A smile appeared on Hyun's face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Of course...!\u300dTarrTarr, who was overwhelmed by his stats, just nodded at Hyun's serious voice tone.\u2018Good. It's been a while, so let's do it properly.'He checked out the time.The tournament duration was three hours in total, so there were still two and a half hours left.Hyun once again walked toward the Virtual Historical Battle and put the hell difficulty ticket he'd bought into play.Doom-While making an imposing sound, the interface turned red.'I should be able to beat it, right?'According to the information of the Interloop, the hell-difficulty missions were created with real Asrian history as background.The fact that there were stages that used real Asrian history was good news for him.Hyun's knowledge covered all past and future incidents of the game.'Since I have to use combos... I should rather fight monsters with low IQ like undead.'One couldn't choose the same theme twice.That's why, that time, the enemies chosen were golems.They were low-IQ monsters created by injecting Magical Power into an inanimate object.Because they also didn't care about themselves, it should\u2019ve been possible to stack lots of combos.[You've picked 'Breaking the Elian Gate'!][You've chosen the hell difficulty!][The bet points are fixed at 5000p!]Whap-The scenery suddenly changed.

Within two hours, destroy the golem's city, reach the core, and destroy it! The whereabouts of the battle on the land is in your hands!> ]'As expected, it's a place I know about.'Hyun, who was borrowing TarrTarr's body, smiled.If you knew the map, there was no point in going straight.'If the video won't be uploaded, I don't need to be careful. Right?'Hyun used \u00abWind Barrier\u00bb, one of the Support's skills, and used it to skip over an impossible route.He wanted to take the shortest possible route.With an Agility that reached 400 and \u00abWind Barrier\u00bb, he could fly through the sky like the protagonist of a martial arts movie.Boom-!Hyun moved forward by demolishing the outer wall of the castle.It only took him about five minutes to reach the middle of the map.'The current speed seems faster than Ain's.'As long as you had the set of the Mythical Assassin, you didn't need to do the initial combo stacking.The place that started in the middle was the Plains of Silence.Lots of golems flocked, but as soon as TarrTarr's dagger touched them, they were cut into pieces as if they'd gone through a blender.The set had an effect that increased the attack range and critical hit damage by three times!On top of that, there was TarrTarr's ultimate attack, \u00abTrance\u00bb![Calculating a new combo record!][5000 combo! You've obtained the achievement \u2018One Who Pioneers the Path of the Sword\u2019!][Because you lack skill level, the number of combos won't increase anymore!][Your Agility has increased by 3!]Ten minutes after the fight began, he reached the max number of combos.But the message Hyun got was different.[Your Agility has increased by 4!]\u00abBiological Time Stop!\u00bbWhile moving through areas where there weren't enemies, he used the item's effect.Once again, he used the \u00abWind Barrier\u00bb to run up a cliff that was over a hundred meters tall.He finally reached the final part of the map.While getting to the place where the core was, Hyun never lost the 5000 combos.'This is the last part.'Paf-!The rocks that formed the boss golem crumbled as two lights cut the front.Although the dagger was just 50 centimeters long, thanks to the Mythical Assassin's set, its attack range had increased to two meters.The black energy that surrounded the two daggers made him look like a demon who was duel-wielding swords.[You've received 1523 damage!]From time to time, he received damage from an attack coming from the sides, but he didn't care about that.Thanks to the 2% absorption that the set had, TarrTarr's HP was constantly being filled.Now that he was dealing a mind-blowing amount of damage thanks to the effect of the combos and ultimate attack, he could recover that amount of damage in a few seconds.Boom-!As TarrTarr cut the dungeon's core in half, all the golems around began crumbling.Even elite monsters over 10 meters tall became ash and scattered away with the wind.It took him only 27 minutes to clear the hell difficulty.[Calculating the results.]- Total Number of Killed Monsters: 10954 (x 2.09)- Elite Monsters Killed: 112 (x 2.12)- Remaining Time: 92 minutes 58 seconds (x 30.9)- Amount Bet: 5000 points<Result: 5000p x 136.91>[Congratulations!

I've completely messed up this tournament. Can I even earn back what I spent?\"Because there wasn't a leaderboard that showed the hell difficulty scores, the average users didn't know about TarrTarr's success.After looking at TarrTarr, who had an absent expression, they thought he was in the same position as them.\"Tsk tsk, it seems like he also messed up.

I'll try to get to the top 30% at least.\"After noticing that TarrTarr was still in front of the Virtual Historical Battle's magic circle, they gave him some advice.\"It seems like you've also lost a lot of points... It's better if you give up. While trying to earn back what you've lost, you'll lose what you\u2019ve got left.\"Of course, Hyun wasn't going to listen to them.Paf- After choosing hell difficulty again, Hyun disappeared.After seeing how TarrTarr ignored their advice, they shook their heads.'To make stacking combos easier, I should pick a mission that takes the least possible time. Right?'He only had two more hell-difficulty tickets.Hyun was thinking of choosing only the missions where he could take the most advantage of TarrTarr's specs and skills.'So there's one more undead mission.'Hyun picked a dinosaur character made of bones.Although it was also an undead, the mission was different.If the previous goal was defending, that time it was to attack.As soon as the mission began, Hyun moved forward.Boom-!The middle boss, who had tens of millions of HP, kneeled down and was defeated.After defeating the boss, Hyun took a breath. Even while doing that, the 5000 combo didn't break.It was thanks to using the \u00abBiological Time Stop\u00bb skill at the correct timing.\u300cThese... Items are too OP.\u300dHyun answered at what TarrTarr suddenly said.\u300cIt's a legendary set that consists of six pieces. In real life, you wouldn't be able to get it, even if you used lots of money. Not only that, but it probably has a level restriction of more than 300.\u300dHyun mumbled while quickly going through the middle boss area and fighting against new enemies.\u300cBasically, this is probably the only time I'll have the opportunity to properly use legendary set items!\u300dSmash- Smash- Smash-!As he swung both hands as if he were doing a sword dance, the enemies disappeared as if he'd used an eraser.\u300cBut isn't it too bad about the 5000 combo limit? Don't you have any skill points left? Raise the \u00abCombo\u00bb skill.\u300d\u300cBut I don't have any unused skill points.\u300d\u300cTsk tsk, why did you increase the critical hit damage-related skills?\u300dSkreee-!Suddenly, bird-type monsters made of bones came flying in their direction.Level 300 flying monsters weren't weak by no means, but as Hyun moved his hands a few times, the bones were shattered into fragments.Thanks to the set's effect, the attack range of the daggers was similar to those of a grand sword of the same category.All enemies that approached TarrTarr got turned into pieces.\u00abBiological Time Stop\u00bb!The cooldown of the set's skill was at 0, so Hyun used it to move to where the boss was.Bone Dragon\u2026A monster with a giant body showed itself.As soon as it appeared, Hyun made quick, consecutive attacks.[You've dealt 105128 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 451942 damage!]That ridiculous amount of damage was possible thanks to having stacked lots of different buffs.But the main reason the damage output was so high was the ultimate attack, \u00abTrance\u00bb!The legendary daggers had a level 300 restriction, and on top of that, there was the effect of \u00abTrance\u00bb. That's why he was able to do attacks with such high damage consecutively.Boom-!The sight of the Bone Dragon being defeated in just a few minutes wasn't something you could easily see.<You've defeated the Necromancer's rebellion! Your achievement will be remembered in the Abyss's history!>[Calculating the results.]- Total Number of Monsters Killed: 5411 (x1.54)- Elite Monsters Killed: 459 (x3.32)- Remaining Time: 50 minutes 19 seconds (x25.9)- Amount Bet: 5000 points<Results: 5000p x 132.42>[Congratulations!

Huh?'Hyun smacked his lips after looking at the points obtained.It took him 40 minutes to clear this mission.It took him a lot more time than the mission in which he had to defeat the golems. Yet he gained less points.Hyun had already cleared the most effective missions, so maybe that was an obvious result.'Well, I guess there's nothing I can do about it... Since I can\u2019t repeat the same mission twice.'It wasn't that he hadn't retried the same mission because he didn't want to. It was that he couldn't.If one wanted to do the same mission, they had to wait until the next tournament.But since your points were reset, it just didn't make sense.Hyun looked at the remaining time.'I guess this is going to be the last one.'Hyun looked at the missions left in the Virtual Historical Battle.There was one left that seemed good.[ <Iluna Moon Invasion> ]Iluna was one of Asra's moons, and it was where one of the fiercest battles between the Heavens and the Abyss had taken place.According to history, the battle had ended with the Heavens winning.From the Abyss's point of view, it was one where you had to die if you wanted the mission to end.[Prepare for a counterattack from the Heavens!]As soon as it started, TarrTarr was standing on top of the moon where the eclipse was going to take place.He looked up at the dark sky.Light pillars caught Hyun's attention.Just like during the Count's Quest, the light pillars were beamed toward the space.And inside the light beam, one girl had her eyes closed and hands together.'Praying...?'Judging by the silhouette, the girl looked like a Priest.Just because it was Hyun, it didn't mean he knew every little detail about Asrian's history, so he didn't know the name of the woman that was praying.He guessed that she was probably a saintess.As the woman kept praying, the lights of Heaven kept getting stronger.Suddenly, the light pillars pierced space, opening a void.The doors of Heaven had opened.Dolls that had wings made of light began descending.Every single doll was a puppet of the angels; they were all over level 300.The surface's monsters looked up at the sky and burned their fighting spirit up.That was a chance to experience what they said was one of the fiercest battles between the Heavens and the Abyss.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 - Turning Point (1)\u300cWoah...\u300dTarrTarr's mouth was agape.Hyun had the same reaction.A fantasy war atmosphere as vivid as that was something you could only feel in Asrian.\u300cIt's too bad that this video can't be uploaded...\u300d\u300cYou can't. Hell difficulty recreates real history, so there is a lot of hidden information.\u300dAt first glance, the number of dolls falling from the sky easily surpassed the thousands.The moment the dolls descended, the war began.Hyun participated in the war as a member of the Abyss.[5000 combo! Because the skill level is low, the number of combos won't increase anymore!]Because the dolls of Heaven, like the golems and undead, didn't have a conscience, they were great for stacking combos.In a war of an overwhelming scale, there were enemies everywhere, so he didn't have to worry about maintaining his combo.Hyun stood in the forefront of the battle and showed a splendid performance.Lots of dolls became light and scattered away after the dagger cut them.He could only use normal attacks, but the truth was that he didn't need anything else other than a normal attack.That was how a combo Thief fought.'Ugh... Danger!'A magic circle suddenly appeared under Hyun's feet, and he quickly moved to the side.As soon as he moved, bolts of lightning began falling one after the other as if it were raining.Slam-As strong energy hit, the surface melted into magma.Although the lightning had barely touched him, he received almost 10 thousand damage.'Is it an angel...?'The moment he lifted his head and looked up\u2026Hyun and TarrTarr felt chills spreading through their body.It was the first time they saw and felt the energy of a Transcendent. It not only filled the entire world but also spread a brutal power.Angel\u2026The entities with wings made of crystal just quietly looked down at the army of the Abyss, which included them.\u300cOof... We won't even be a match.\u300dAlthough there was only one enemy, its presence was equal to more than tens of thousands.The moment an angel appeared, the balance of the fight tipped toward the Heavens.Tens of Baloks shot flames toward the angel.Even while covered by green flames, the angel kept calmly walking toward them while stepping in the air.Slash-!A huge blue sword was drawn horizontally.It looked as if the world was divided into two.Hyun knew the name of the skill it had just used.\u00abSpace Divider\u00bb.Although it looked like a simple hand gesture, it was a technique that annihilated thousands of opponents by hitting the air.All monsters around them were cut in half and returned to being black energy.TarrTarr, who was in the middle of the Abyss's army, shared the same fate as the others.[You've died!]Without feeling pain, TarrTarr's body, which was cut in half, started to fall until it became light and scattered away.Then he received a message that said that the quest had ended.<xxxx years ago.

Next time, if you come with Ain, you'll probably succeed. So don't get discouraged.\u300dTarrTarr quietly mumbled.TarrTarr said that just in case Hyun was discouraged, but Hyun answered him with another question as if he were asking him what he was talking about.\u300cWhat?\u300d\u300cThat strange item you wanted to buy.\u300d\u300cWho said I won't be able to buy it? I have enough time.\u300d\u300cBut you need tp get 400 thousand points in 10 minutes... Do we have time to do another mission?\u300d\u300cAnother mission? In 10 minutes? What are you talking about?\u300d\u300cThat's my point!\u300dHyun ignored TarrTarr and walked toward the Darkness's Rest Area.The bartender smiled after seeing the only VVIP client.The item Hyun wanted to buy was the closest one to gambling.<Order List>-[Point Bag (Small) x 5000 (Price: 10 points)][Point Bag (XL) x 1000 (Price: 50 points)]Each one had between 1 ~ 500 and 10 ~ 5000 points. Hyun bought them all.The bartender looked at Hyun with worrying eyes.\"As a seller, I shouldn't be saying this... But you shouldn't expect to receive lots of points from the bags.\"Just like he said, the chance of getting lots of points from the bags was low.If you looked at it in terms of profit and loss, you would be at a loss.But even after hearing the bartender's warning, Hyun just smiled.[ <Time left until the point settlement begins: 8 minutes 21 seconds> ]While everyone was desperate to increase as many points as possible in the time that was left, Hyun was preparing the next plan while taking it easy.As previously mentioned, in the tournament, there were lots of different ways to overcome the difference between users in terms of specs.There were other places like the Darkness's Rest Area; among them were some shops, places where you could gamble, and even an auction house!If you used those things correctly, anyone could rank higher than they normally could.'So it's here.'The place Hyun reached was an auction house that was inside the casino.Hyun placed all the point bags he'd bought at the VVIP auction house for 10 times their original price.\u300cHuh?\u300dTarrTarr didn't understand Hyun's auctions.He had thought that Hyun bought the point bags because he was lacking some and because he had nothing to lose.Without answering TarrTarr's doubts, Hyun walked toward the Darkness's Rest Area and ordered a beverage.The taste of that beverage that costed 50 points was quite good.\u300cWatching people just before the tournament is about to end is also very fun.\u300dWhile leaning on a chair, Hyun looked at one of the tournament's most popular events\u2014the death match.It wasn't suitable for combo Thieves like TarrTarr, but because you could always find a match, the Death Match was good as a last resort\u2014that's why there were lots of users.\u300cWill it sell?\u300d\u300cWhat?\u300d\u300cWhat you've put in the auction house. It clearly says that the possibility of earning points is low. I was wondering how many people were willing to buy the point bag.\u300d\u300cYou're worrying too much.\u300dHyun laughed at TarrTarr's worries and opened the window with the list of rewards.<Rewards of the 4th Duke's Tournament>1 ~ 10th place: Duke's Affection. (The rate depends on your ranking.)11 ~ 100th place: Medal of Darkness x500, Demon's Token 1101st place ~ 0.5%: Medal of Darkness x2000.5% ~ 3%: Medal of Darkness x803% ~ 10%: Medal of Darkness x3010% ~ 20%: Medal of Darkness x1220% ~ 30%: 100 gold\u2026The list went under 30%.If you didn't make it to the 50%, you wouldn't even receive 50 gold, which was the fee to enter the tournament.\u300cDo you get it now?\u300dShowing the rewards was Hyun's way of answering TarrTarr's question.If he understood the tournament's reward system, he would understand the reason behind his actions.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *[The tournament has ended!][Point calculations will begin in 10 minutes! Please finish all the preparations before then!]As the alarm that announced, the ending spread, and the tournament arena became noisy.Because all the magic circles had lost their light, there were no longer ways to increase points.The users had just finished inspecting what they'd earned and were quietly waiting for the tournament to come to an end.While checking out his ranking, Hyun smiled while drinking the beverage.* * *\"Ugh...! Just for 91 points...!\"Restine, one of the participants of the 4th tournament, sighed.He opened the ranking window. His current position was 105.He\u2019d tried his best until the tournament ended, but in the end, he couldn't enter the top 100.\"If I had been quicker at the end, I would've been able to get at least 100 more points!\"But there was nothing he could do about it.Because he wasn't able to enter the top 100, he would receive the same reward as the person who placed 750.Since the reward system was built in an escalated system, from the 100th ranking up to 0.5%, players were treated equally.Even if the person who was placed 750 only had half the points he had, they would receive the same reward.If he hadn't tried his best, he wouldn't even be bothered by that.\"Hmm?\"As he swallowed the bitter taste, he noticed that the atmosphere was weird.Tens of users were gathered in a corner and were heated up.\"What... Is there something left?\"Restine wondered why there was so much noise when the tournament had already ended, so he decided to approach the crowd.It was in front of the auction house.Many users were sighing, and others were shouting in excitement.\"Huh? If it's already over, why is everyone here?\"From what he knew, in the tournament's auction house, you could only exchange points with items you could use only while the tournament was going on.Basically, from the moment it officially ended, there was no point in using it at all.You couldn't sell all the buff items for even one point, even though they were selling for more than 300 during the tournament.But Restine subconsciously approached the desk and saw the list of items for sale through the interface. His eyes shook.[Point Bag (XL)] (Fixed Price: 500 points)- There's a random amount of points between 10 ~ and 5000.- They'll get destroyed 10 minutes after the 4th tournament ends.- The probability of getting a high number of points is low! Maybe the more you buy, the more you'll lose?<Left: 648>\"Huh, what's this?!\"Thanks to the AI, the interface showed each user what they needed the most.He was confused for a while but soon came back to his senses.It wasn't important why it was in the auction house.Suddenly, a certain thought crossed his mind.'Wait... It doesn't matter how much I lose. There's almost no chance I'll drop below 750! What if I hit the jackpot even once...?'There were two types of point pockets.Restine first used 100 points to buy a [Point Bag (Small)] and opened it immediately.Inside, there was a ridiculously small number of points, but that didn't discourage him. He bought another one.[You've obtained 3 points!][You've obtained 2 points!][You've obtained 32 points!]\"Ugh...!\"He had spent 400 points, yet could only recover about 10% of what he had spent.Restine took a deep breath and spent 500 points to buy a [Points Bag (XL)].As if he were praying, he closed his eyes and opened it.A miracle happened.[You've won! You've obtained 1593 points!]\"Nice!\"The moment he got the points, Restine passed the 100th place cut line, and his ranking went up to 92.Under the celebrating system message, Restine shouted excitedly.After a while, he finally calmed down and looked around.Only a few users were able to win something like him, most of them were clicking their tongues or shaking their heads.He felt bad for being excited while so many people were saddened by the results, so he quickly walked away from the auction house.Then, suddenly, he began wondering about something.'Why was this on the auction house?'From what he'd seen, there were hundreds of those.Sometimes, some of the point bags you received as compensation were put in the auction house, but it should\u2019ve be impossible for a user to put hundreds of them up.Was it an event from an NPC related to the tournament?He thought about it for a while but couldn't come up with an answer.The situation Restine was experiencing was happening simultaneously throughout the entire tournament area.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 - Turning Point (2)The auction house's network was connected to all the other tournament venues, so the point bags sold out really fast.That was an effect created by the escalated reward system.Anyone would roll the dice at least once if they had nothing to lose.Even users whose ranking wasn't going to change either way bought a bag just for fun.\u300cA-amazing...!\u300dTarrTarr couldn't hide his surprise.\u300cIt sold out...\u300dIn a tournament with 150 thousand participants, hundreds or even thousands wasn't a high number.After the items sold out, there were some people that put out the same item for an even higher price.Those were put out by some people who'd bought many copies of Hyun's item.\u300cSee, I told you not to worry.\u300dAfter he pressed the pay-out button, a number of around a million got converted into points after discounting the commission.[You're ranked 1st! You currently have 2981385p points!]It was an overwhelming number of points.But thanks to buying \u00abTrick\u00bb in the VVIP marketplace, people just saw a number of around 100 thousand in the rankings.Everything had worked as he had planned from the moment he entered the tournament arena until then.[Soul Replication Elixir]- You can generate a 2nd skill tree slot permanently.- Each slot consumes skill points separately.(Price: 2.5 million points)\"Th... Thank you.\"The price of the Soul Replication Elixir was 2.5 million.The moment one sold, it went out of stock.'Hmm?'When Hyun was about to close the buy interface, he noticed something.Because he was using \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, he immediately knew.TarrTarr's sight was fixed in a certain item.TarrTarr's easy-to-read reactions made Hyun laugh.\u300cWhat, you want that?\u300d[Reversal of Potential]- Except for the awakening skill, you can reset all the skills and points invested.(Price: 100 thousand points)\u300cI... Was wondering if you were going to use the remaining 400 thousand points.\u300d\u300cSay it clearly. You want it or not?\u300d\u300cO-of course I want it! You said that my skill tree was ruined!\u300dHyun paused for a while and then started speaking again.\u300cLet's think about it slowly. Items that reset your skill tree are extremely rare. If it weren't for me, would you even be able to unlock the VVIP marketplace?\u300dThe truth was that there were some other ways to reset the skill tree... But there was no need to talk about those right then.TarrTarr struggled for a while but then finally answered.\u300cIt would've probably been impossible... Right?\u300d\u300cOf course! Getting a Lucky Chip isn't an easy feat. Of course, if you're at my level, the story changes.\u300d\u300cY... Yeah...\u300dTarrTarr followed Hyun's words with an uneasy look on his face.He was expecting his wish to be denied, but the flow of the conversation had suddenly changed.\u300cBut we're collaborators. Did you think that I wouldn't even do something like that for you?\u300dHyun left enough points to retain the ranking and then bought three copies of \u2018Reversal of Potential.'Why wouldn't he use points that were going to disappear either way?From the beginning, that was the only thing worth buying from the VVIP marketplace.So there weren't any other options.\u300cFufu... Big brother is going to be generous with you. You don't need to pay me back immediately. I'm going to take a cut from your salary in the future. Okay?\u300dFrom the three, he gave one to TarrTar and kept the other two.Checking out what those were worth was very easy... He could just upload one to a marketplace and then take it out.Seeing TarrTarr happy made Hyun feel relaxed, and a warm smile was drawn on his face.[The point calculations have ended!][1st place! You've won the tournament!][Congratulations! You've received an invitation to the Duke's party!]As he received the message with the results, the 4th tournament organized by the Abyss ended.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The party began at night.It was still afternoon.Hyun decided to use his free time to finish some things.The moment he used the Soul Replication Elixir he bought in the Darkness's Rest Area, his body was covered by light.Hyun felt as if he'd woken up after being unconscious for a short while.Then he finally received the message.[An extra skill tree slot has been generated!][You have 132 unused skill points in the 2nd skill slot!]Hyun smiled after seeing the empty skill tree.It was hard not to smile.'Things are going faster than planned.'Even in the game's latter half, there weren't many ways to add another skill tree.He was sure that, even among Asra players, he was the only one who knew about the Soul Replication Elixir.And the fact that he was able to get it at level 100 was an incredible achievement!That basically meant he could use double the number of skill points compared to others.Until then, most skill points were invested in the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb, and he had used the remaining ones to level up other skills.It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that he'd used \u00abAssimilation\u00bb for everything.'It wouldn't be bad to pick skills with another concept.'He wouldn't rely only on \u00abAssimilation\u00bb anymore.Just when he was questioning his identity, he had gotten a massive amount of points.\"You'll have to wait a lot because it's probably going to take me a while,\" Hyun said to TarrTarr, who was looking at him from the side.As soon as the tournament ended, TarrTarr had reset his skills and picked them just like Hyun told him to.\u2014Extreme combo thief setting.Although it wasn't that good for PvP, if your control was good, you wouldn't lag behind the other classes while hunting.\"It's okay. I'm just going to be here watching!\"\"It makes me uncomfortable. That's why I was asking you to go and play somewhere else.\"\"Then I'll do that!\"Even though Hyun had asked him to stop bothering him, TarrTarr seemed excited.After Hyun was left alone, he began thinking about possible skill combinations.'First, I should fill it with buff-type skills. Right?'Although the Support was similar to a Priest, it didn't have a way to recover HP.But thanks to it being a hidden job, the efficacy of the supporting skills was incomparable.Hyun always thought that it was a bummer that he hadn't been able to properly use the other skills thanks to having focused mostly on \u00abAssimilation\u00bb or \u00abVision Sword\u00bb, so that was a perfect chance for him.'I also have the option to reset the skills, so there's nothing to be afraid of!'He had focused on \u00abVision Sword\u00bb because he wanted to be able to deal lots of damage... But if he looked at it from an efficiency point of view, he could've probably come up with a stronger combination.The true value of the Support job came from its exclusive skills!Hyun thought about all the possible skill combinations.But he had already thought of the best possible one, so it didn't take him long.[\u00abImpact Amplification\u00bb Lv.3]- Increase the damage of allies that are within a range of two meters by 2x.- The amplification lasts 10 minutes.<Mana Required: 80>The first skill he thought of was one that buffed.If \u00abPowerless Wave\u00bb reduced the opponent's defense, \u00abImpact Amplification\u00bb increased the damage allies dealt.'Although it's useless without \u00abAssimilation\u00bb...'The bad thing about amplification skills was that they had hard pre-requisites.While in a battle, a Support couldn't always be next to an ally. Right?But if you had \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, the story changed.There was no reason not to learn the best possible buff skill.Hyun didn't doubt for a moment and used 30 points.But he still had 102 points left.'Now, I should pick a utility one.'Hyun checked out the skill list once more.Since the time he used to play Asra, Hyun liked skills that could create an unforeseen variable.The skill he found this time was one that could let him stylishly lead the battle.[\u00abInvisible\u00bb Lv.2]- Makes the target invisible for two seconds.- While using \u00abInvisible\u00bb, all attacks become critical hits.<Cooldown Time: 120 seconds>[\u00abBiorhythm Acceleration\u00bb Lv.3]- Increase the speed of a target by 250%.<Cooldown Time: 120 seconds>Invisibility and a skill that accelerated!According to the skills\u2019 explanations, both had a range of 20 meters. They didn't require mana, and the cooldown time for both was 120 seconds.If amplification-type skills worked great with \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, those two skills were great because he could use them in all conditions.As he spent 30 and 40 points respectively, the second skill tree became filled with four new skills.The reason why he'd spent so many points on them was that it was better to make the main skills stronger rather than having lots of useless ones.The duration of \u00abInvisible\u00bb depended on the skill level, so everything was decided in an instant. That's why one second could make a huge difference in a battle.'What would happen if I used both skills simultaneously?'Hyun tried to think of the combination between \u00abInvisible\u00bb and \u00abBiorhythm Acceleration\u00bb, but then he noticed something.His body started trembling because of expectation.There was a good way to test the new skills he had learned.\u300cTarrTarr, come here.\u300d\u300cDid you finish?\u300d\u300cDo you want to PvP?\u300dThe moment he heard the word \u201cPvP\u201d, he seemed troubled.\"I'm a combo thief, so I'm weak in PvP...\"\"And I'm a Support, so who cares? It's not like you're really going to die.\"And that's how TarrTarr and Hyun's duel began.Since it was a friendly battle, one could play with various settings, but Hyun decided to leave things as they were.That meant both sides were on equal terms.\u00abPowerless Wave\u00bb.Before the battle began, Hyun used a skill.The reason he didn't use \u00abImpact Amplification\u00bb was that he soon discovered that it didn't work on himself.[Three, Two, One, fight!]'\u00abInvisible\u00bb, \u00abBiorhythm Acceleration\u00bb!'The moment the countdown reached 0, he used the other two skills and immediately ran towards TarrTarr.Paf-!When Hyun's figure disappeared, TarrTarr looked around, surprised.It was to find Hyun, who had suddenly vanished.It was at that moment\u2026[Critical Hit! You've received 52 damage!][Critical Hit! You've received 51 damage!][Critical Hit! You've received 55 damage!][Critical Hit! You've received 60 damage!][Critical Hit! You've received 49 damage!]...\"Ugh, wh-what's happening?!\" TarrTarr shouted in surprise.After using \u00abInvisible\u00bb, Hyun had started to attack at a very high speed.Before he could find a way to counter, thanks to the consecutive attacks, the battle had ended before the duration of \u00abInvisible\u00bb was over.When Hyun's figure appeared, TarrTarr just stared at him blankly.\"Was the novice dagger this good...?\"It wasn't just TarrTarr who was dumbfounded. Hyun was also in the same state.He didn't expect the skill combination he had just created to work so perfectly!It wasn't TarrTarr's fault he'd lost.The battle had ended the moment the opponent's figure disappeared. Who could've reacted to that type of strategy the first time they saw it?'I didn't use any amplification buff. This meant that in a real battle, the damage output would be even higher...!'Hyun's heart was beating faster. He was in a good mood.The expectations regarding the new skill tree were getting bigger.To be honest, Hyun had been underestimating the Support's skills up until then.Even if the effects were great, they were all designed to support others. Right?He didn't feel okay investing points in a skill that he couldn't become the target of.But as he learned \u00abAssimilation\u00bb and started to unlock the Support's skills, he had no other option but to change his opinion.Hyun's heart began beating faster as he took a glimpse of the true potential of the Support.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 - Toward the Depths of the Abyss (1)'I should try it a few more times.'Hyun dueled TarrTarr once more to verify a few more tests.Thsy time, Hyun's figure also disappeared as if it were a ghost.As Hyun became invisible, TarrTarr swung his sword in the air, but there was no way Hyun was going to be hit by those kinds of attacks.Whish-!In the blink of an eye, tens of attacks flew in his direction, and that battle also didn't last more than two seconds.\"Wait, so... What happened?\"\"\u00abInvisible\u00bb... And a speed buff on top of that.\"\"This isn't fair!\" TarrTarr shouted.It was because he had taken the role of a punching bag without knowing the reason for a while.Hyun, who had gained a new skill, couldn't stop smiling.It was the first time he felt like that after starting to play Asrian.TarrTarr had become tired before the party even began due to Hyun\u2019s excitement.* * *[Invitation from the Darkness]- You'll be transported immediately to the banquet hall. (Remaining time: 3 minutes 12 seconds)After the tournament ended, that item was in TarrTarr\u2019s inventory.\u2014It was an invitation given to the top 10 users.Hyun and TarrTarr had to participate in that party.The first reason was that they still hadn't received the reward for winning the tournament, and the second was to reach the Abyss Repository, which was the quest's destination.\u300cAre you ready?\u300dAfter he used the ticket, a portal opened in front of them.The moment they stepped in, the scenery around changed.[The barrier is encroaching upon the surroundings!][Since your level is low, you can't resist! Your stats have temporarily been decreased by 50%!]\u300cUgh...!\u300dTarrTarr took a deep breath.As he stepped in, he felt an intense energy tightening around his body.A few moments later, he finally could grasp the situation.There was a luxurious palace in front of them.Hyun immediately recognized the place.The Dark Palace.That place, bigger than the king's palace, didn't have windows because it was located in a place so deep in the Abyss that humans couldn't reach it.A middle-aged man wearing a suit was waiting for them.\"This way.\"Thanks to following the butler, it didn't take him long to reach where the party would take place.A luxurious door opened at the end of the corridor.\"The winner of this tournament, TarrTarr, has come.\"The moment they entered the banquet hall, a voice amplified by Magical Power echoed through the room.All the NPCs that belonged to the Abyss and the users that came before\u2026All the Dukes that were behind looked at TarrTarr, who had just entered\u2026TarrTarr was feeling pressured by everyone looking at him, but he advanced while trying to ignore them.\"It's the rumored winner.\"\"He won despite looking weak... Is this because he's a user?\"The NPCs murmured while looking at TarrTarr.Because he'd won the tournament, no one in the Abyss didn't know about TarrTarr.It was the same for the users.TarrTarr was already known as someone talented, thanks to YouTube and the community boards.\"I didn't notice it in the video, but he really is a kid. I don't think he's even in high school...\"\"They say he's level 70... If that's true, he's incredibly talented.\"While everyone was murmuring, something that surprised everyone happened.One of the five Dukes in the banquet hall suddenly approached TarrTarr. It was so quick that it seemed like magic.\"So you're the winner.\"NPCs couldn't hide their surprise.It was unusual for a Duke to move before the party began.The banquet hall became silent.While everyone was holding their breath, the Duke said something more.\"Will you serve me? If you do so, I'll give you all the pleasures that the world has to offer.\"The NPCs were surprised once more.Was that user who seemed like a kid that impressive?\u300cPlease say something!\u300dThat time, even TarrTarr couldn't hide the surprise on his face.Because he'd let Hyun make all the decisions until then, he tried to ask him again.But Hyun thought about something that he thought would be fun.'It should be okay if I let him make the decision. Right?'Accepting or refusing the Duke's proposal had its benefits or drawbacks.Accepting increased the risk but also the rewards.Refusing the proposal had no risk, but the rewards obtained also decreased.That would become a turning point for TarrTarr.If it were him, he would accept the proposal. But since TarrTarr was part of the Heavens, maybe it would be better if he refused.Since he belonged to the opposite force, the risk would get bigger.'He should decide his path.'There was also another reason\u2026Hyun thought it'd be fun to see him dumbfounded.TarrTarr's innocent reactions were stimulating Hyun's mischievous side.Hyun whispered while laughing.\u300cHey, you seem popular. Even the Duke is desperate to scout you.\u300d\u300cSo what should I answer?!\u300d\u300cDo as you wish. This guy doesn't even know about my existence. So what do you want me to say?\u300d\u300cSo I should say it on my own?\u300d\u300cYes.\u300dHyun could feel that TarrTarr's heart was starting to beat faster.Was he wondering about what to answer?But as time went on, TarrTarr wasn't able to answer easily.But thankfully, another Duke opened his mouth.\"Stop it, Bahmir. The party hasn't even begun yet.\"\"Digitalis, what do you want?\"\"The private talks should take place after the rewards are given out.\"While everyone was holding their breath, the two Dukes looked at each other.The reason why no one could interfere was that those two were the ones who had the highest hierarchy in the place.\"Oof, a useless procedure.\"Bahmir shrugged his shoulders and went back to his place.Just then, the atmosphere relaxed a bit.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The banquet hall became noisy again, and the award ceremony continued.The reward was given according to the rankings, so TarrTarr's turn was last.[You've received the rewards!]Reward - 50000 gold, Medal of Darkness x3000, Demon's Token x5, the Core of a High-Ranking Monster.The rewards for 1st place couldn't be compared to the rest of the players.Although they would soon enter Hyun's inventory, they were with TarrTarr for the moment.Soon, the award ceremony came to an end, and the proper party began.It was the perfect chance for users to gain the Duke's affection!Users that belonged to the Abyss could only expect support from the Dukes.In some community posts, they mentioned that, rather than winning the tournament, gaining affection from the Dukes was more important.How NPCs treated users varied greatly depending on their affection toward them.\"It seems like I hurried too much before.\"Just as expected, as soon as the party began, Bahmir approached TarrTarr.\"Did you finish thinking?\"TarrTarr had been asking for help from Hyun for a while through whisper.But Hyun just kept watching TarrTarr suffer.He just gave him some vague advice, but he didn't seem to have the intention of helping.TarrTarr nervously gulped.\"Hmm... You know.\"Bahmir frowned a little bit.He thought that TarrTarr was testing him.If it were his subordinate, he would have executed him, but he wasn't going to do that.\"As expected from a user, but it's okay for you to be a little bit more arrogant.\"Bahmir made an offer again.He saw how TarrTarr had defeated each quest, so he thought highly of him.Because he couldn't see Hyun's soul inside TarrTarr, he thought that the skills and control shown were his.\"If you serve me, I'll show you that everything you've received up until now is nothing...\"\"That...\"\"Hmm?\"\"Sh-should I...?\"TarrTarr was overwhelmed by the pressure applied by the Duke and subconsciously ended up accepting.A smile appeared on Bahmir's face.\"Haha, good decision! You won't regret it!\"\"Huh...?\"\"TarrTarr, from today, I'll name you as my knight! The contract has been made! I guarantee that there are no lies in my words.\"[You've obtained the title \u2018Duke's Knight\u2019!]- You deal extra 5% damage to the ones that belong to Heaven!The reason why only TarrTarr got the title was that he had mentioned his ID.Hyun smiled.Should he make a joke?Before TarrTarr answered, Hyun had already prepared two different opposing answers.While making sure not to laugh, Hyun said while making a big deal out of it.\u300cHey, you belong to Heaven. How can you accept becoming the underling of a Duke?!\u300d\u300cWhat?! But you told me to do as I wish!\u300d\u300cI thought that you'd refuse for sure...\u300d\u300cWhat... Can't I cancel it?! Also, why didn't you help me from the beginning..?!\u300dTarrTarr was about to cry.Bahmir and TarrTarr were both smiling.Lots of messages appeared in front of TarrTarr.[Your soul's string has been connected to Bahmir!][You've unlocked a new job, 'The Knight of Death'! You can change to it from level 100 onwards!][From time to time, the Duke will get to you through the soul's string!]After reading all the messages, TarrTarr's voice trembled.He should be happy that he had unlocked what seemed like a hidden job, but he couldn't comprehend the last part very well.\u300cDid I screw up...?!\u300d\u300cYes, probably... The fact that, as a member of the Heaven's, you became the Duke's servant is a little bit... There are no precedents of something like this.\u300dTo be honest, he hadn't screwed it up.The \u2018Knight of Death\u2019 was a job that was considered one with great potential, even in the previous game, so who could say that he had screwed up?Not only that, but he had gained the Duke's affection. And with that, he gained extra benefits!The reason why users preferred the Heavens was simple:Even without gaining the affection of NPCs, you could receive help.But if they could earn the affection of a Duke, a user belonging to the Abyss could receive as much help as a ranker that belonged to the Heavens.That was if you could overcome some risks.'I should tell TarrTarr to change forces as quickly as possible.'The biggest penalty was that TarrTarr belonged to the Heavens.If he did something that benefited the Heavens, there was a chance that he would be considered a traitor.In the worst case, he would end up executed.Of course, Hyun was not going to let that happen.He still had lots of things to do with TarrTarr, so he was going to reduce the variables as much as possible.'I guess it's a relief that I'm part of the Abyss.'While Hyun and TarrTarr were thinking, Bahmir disappeared as fast as he had appeared.But the interest in TarrTarr from people around didn't decrease.The other Dukes?No, it wasn't them.There wasn't an NPC who dared to droll over a user that had already been targetted by Bahmir, one of the highest-ranking beings.\"You're TarrTarr, right?\"The ones interested in him were the other users.Berard, the user who had reached 5th place in the rankings in Asra.He had been waiting for Bahmir to go away in order to approach TarrTarr.\"My ID is Berard, although I'm just a normal user compared to you, but I'm ranked.\"'Berard?'The one that was surprised after hearing that username wasn't TarrTarr, but Hyun.TarrTarr still hadn't come back to his senses.Berard... There was no way he wouldn't remember that ID he'd seen for many years.Hyun looked at his face carefully.Did Berard always look like that?The user with whom he played Asra Online seemed unfamiliar.Hyun was covered by an unfamiliar mood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 Toward the Depths of the Abyss (2)Hyun quickly brushed off the nonsensical thoughts.Whether Berard used his real-life appearance or had changed it wasn't important.Now that he thought about it, compared to the shock he\u2019d felt when he met Ain, it was nothing.He\u2019d said he was a ranker, so it was probable that the Berard in front of him was the one he knew.\"Hmm? Do you know me...?\"\"No, I just thought that if you're a ranker, you're probably an amazing person.\"\"Fufu, I ranked 2nd in the third tournament. I still have a long way to go.\"Berard went straight to the point.That's how much he wanted to scout the user in front of him.\"I approached you because I wanted to ask you to join our guild. Although it\u2019s closer to a gathering than a guild at the moment...\"Berard cut the conversation at that point for a moment.After looking TarrTarr's reaction, he kept talking.\"It's a guild created by ex-Asra Online users.\"Hyun shrugged his shoulders. It was the first time he'd heard that.He was expecting ex-Asra players to move to Asrian, but he wasn't expecting them to create a guild.Berard smiled after seeing the other person\u2019s surprise.He thought that if it were that type of reaction, he'd have an easy time convincing him.\"As expected, you know about Asra Online. All the information other guilds treat as confidential is nothing to us.\"\"Hmm...\"\"If you join us, we'll tell you all the information we know.\"Of course, Berard had no intention of telling him everything.But it wasn't a lie that he'd do his best to help TarrTarr.Giving him huge benefits and preventing them from leaving was one of the recruitment techniques.To be able to face those two who were probably somewhere growing constantly, they had to incorporate as many people as possible. They had to do it as soon as possible since the game was still in its infancy.\"If you join us, we'd probably become invincible!\"\"Wait, don't you think you need to listen to our offer, too?\"Everyone turned their head around after hearing a familiar woman's voice. After seeing who it was, they couldn't hide their surprise.TarrTarr and Berard were both surprised, but the one who was surprised the most was Hyun.He didn't know what to call it. Was this fate? Or an ill-fated one? It wasn't an unfamiliar face.'Mayday? Why is she here?'Because she was wearing a hat, no one noticed her presence.Mayday had ended up 2nd after Lattice in the first tournament.That meant that, just like Berard, she had fulfilled the pre-requisite to obtaining an invitation.\"So you're Berard... Your best ranking was 5th.\"\"What, how do you know that?!\"\"Did you think we wouldn't now? That's not everything we know...\"The Darkness guild had recently succeeded in incorporating an Asra ranker.Thanks to that, the guild's database had grown a lot.That was why Mayday knew about Berard even though his name wasn't in the hall of fame.\"See? We don't lack in terms of information, so there's no need to listen to that person.\"\"But still, we...\"\"No. Not only that, but we have a ranker who was better positioned than you.\"Mayday once again interrupted Berard.What she said next was a surprise to everyone.\"According to him, his 'average' ranking was 4th... Berard, your 'best' ranking was 5th, right? You know who I'm talking about, right?\"\"Wh-what?!\"Berard was horrified.He wasn't sure if she was telling the truth or not, but seeing how she knew about his past, she didn't seem to be lying.Mayday once again looked at TarrTarr and said something that turned Berard's proposal into nothing.\"And there's more! We'll give you a sign-off bonus of a million dollars for a contract of six months. How about that?\"'What, a million?!'Hyun's chin almost dropped after hearing the proposal.TarrTarr's reaction wasn't that different from his.Just a few words were enough for Mayday to swing things over to her side.\"Fufu, this much is nothing. Our guild's sponsor is an impressive company! After six months, you'll want to stay in Darkness.\"\"Fu, you want to do something with only that much money?\" Said Berard, who had been listening on the sides.\"He's someone who can earn millions in six months. Trying to convince him with just that? Nonsense.\"Berard's answer just created lots of question marks inside Hyun's head.'What is this guy talking about? How am I going to earn millions?'Hyun and TarrTarr hadn't logged out from the game even once that day.So they didn't know about what was happening outside.They didn't know that there were articles about how TarrTarr had beaten Lattice's record in the Virtual Historical Battle.\u2014And how the YouTube views had exploded with that!Because they didn't understand the situation, it made sense that what Berard was saying sounded like nonsense.\"That's why I've said that a million is what we're going to pay him after joining Darkness. There're obviously other bonuses! For example, we won't restrict personal profits, whether through broadcasting or other things.\"While Hyun was listening to Mayday's words, dumbfounded, he heard TarrTarr's voice, who seemed in a hurry.\u300cCheck this out! The video\u2019s views... Have surpassed seven million!\u300d\u300cWhat?\u300d\u300cI don't know what happened, but suddenly, the number of comments has increased a lot, too!\u300dIt seemed like TarrTarr had checked out the YouTube channel through the capsule's search window.Because Hyun's capsule wasn't the newest model, he could only use the internet if he logged out or was in rest mode, so he couldn't immediately check it out.\u300cS-seven thousand dollars?!\u300d\u300cNo, the views have surpassed seven million.\u300d\u300cThat's that! Wait... I'll be back.\u300d\u300cR-right now?!\u300d\u300cYes.\u300d\u300c'Hyun' has changed his status to rest mode.\u300d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *As soon as SeoHyun exited the capsule, he began typing on the keyboard.As he logged in to TarrTarr's channel, he saw a number so big that it was hard to read at first sight.'Seven million views in 10 hours? Is this possible?'He couldn't believe what his eyes were seeing.Every time he refreshed the page, the views increased.As he took a closer look at the other videos on TarrTarr's channel, all the other four videos had also surpassed a million views.The total amount of views was about 15 million.'What's happening?'It took SeoHyun a while to understand what was going on.He understood what was going on only after reading a post on a community board that he\u2019d often used to enter.The commotion, which began in a foreign community board, had spread worldwide in less than 10 hours.Although it was in just one area, users were shocked that a level 70 player had been able to surpass Lattice, who was the overwhelming 1st place in the rankings.'Can something like this happen?'Hyun was surprised by people's reactions because he didn't think that Lattice was particularly amazing.He also didn't think that breaking the record in the Virtual Historical Battle was a big deal.He thought of it just like establishing a new high score inside one of the many mini-games in the tournament venue.There was a big difference in perception because Hyun's standards differed from those of an average user.After looking at the community boards closely, Hyun once again discovered something.\u2014The users who were at the top of the rankings were admired as if they were some kind of gods.The ones who were at the top of the rankings like Lattice and Mayday, and Ain and a few other users who had been the center of attention\u2026And just that day, TarrTarr's name had joined that group.'I see\u2026 This is what he meant by earning millions!'Hyun finally understood Berard's words.The amount of money top rankers earned was mind-blowing.SeoHyun looked at the number of views.If he could earn $7,000 USD in 10 hours, in 24 hours, he would be able to earn at least 10 thousand dollars... If he added all five videos that had recently been uploaded, the amount of money would probably increase to 20 ~ 30 thousand dollars.What would his old self say if he heard that this was the amount of money he could earn in just a day?'This is crazy...!'\u300cUser 'Hyun'\u00a0 is online.\u300d\u300cTarrTarr! Are you here?\u300dWhen Hyun logged in, TarrTarr was struggling because of Berard and Mayday's proposal.\u300cWhat should I do about these people?\u300d\u300cWhat? Are these guys still here? Just ask them to leave.\u300dAs Hyun got the control priority, the shy boy's eyes suddenly changed.Mayday and Berard flinched after noticing the sudden change in the aura. While trying to back off, they heard Hyun's firm refusal.\"I'm going to refuse to negotiate furthermore. I'm not interested, so please return to your respective places.\"\"Why? Why so suddenly...?\" Mayday shouted.\"Is it the money? Okay, we'll pay you two million plus the same conditions! This is the most money I can prepare!\"'Two million...?'Hyun's heart was about to change, but he could refuse the temptation because he'd seen the bigger picture.'I can't send TarrTarr to somewhere else.'\u2014Especially because he couldn't allow him to join another guild.TarrTarr knew all his information. And on top of that, he was one of the few users who knew about the \u00abAssimilation\u00bb skill.He wanted to avoid information about him leaking as much as possible.Not only that, but TarrTarr had to edit videos for him so he could earn money.\"No, it's not about the money.\"\"Then why's that? Tell me if there's anything we can do for you...\"\"I don't have intentions of joining any guild. I'm more comfortable playing solo.\"\"What are you...?!\"Mayday wanted to refute Hyun, but he was quicker.While Berard and Mayday looked at TarrTarr's back, dumbfounded, Hyun quickly left the banquet hall.'Oof...'He walked around near the waiting room.Even as time flowed, he couldn't calm down.The number of views roamed around his head as an image of a bag full of money.'If I can earn 30 thousand per day... If it goes like this, could I really earn at least 900 thousand per month?'After thinking about that unrealistic number, he felt something.He hadn't yet felt how big Asrian was, even though he'd seen analytics about it on the news and many community boards.As that approached him as money, he understood what kind of game it was.'This isn't just a popular game... This is like a world on its own!'He'd already felt it once when he\u2019d received 50 thousand from Jini, but as the number passed to the hundred thousands, the feeling changed.Becoming number one in the rankings of such a game\u2026 wasn't it comparable to becoming an emperor for real?Hyun became immersed in his own thoughts for a while while remembering his time in Asra.* * *\u300cYou failed?\u300dThe leader of Darkness, XL, couldn't believe Mayday's report.\u300cI never expected he was going to refuse with such conditions.\u300d\u300cThat's not it. That person didn't even listen to me until the end. He just left the room. He said something about enjoying playing solo...?!\u300dAfter listening to a more detailed explanation from Mayday, XL didn't know what to say.Bear Shield, who was with him, began laughing.\"It seems like he's still a kid... I'm not sure if it's because he thinks it's cooler this way or he's clever.\"\"Even if he's little, there's no way he didn't understand the value of that contract.\"\"Then is it possible that he refused because he's waiting for us to improve it?\"The executive staff members fell deep into thought.It was hard to understand the user TarrTarr's intentions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 - Toward the Depths of the Abyss (3)The vice-leader of the guild, Reina, spoke to someone next to her.In the room of executives, there was one man that hadn\u2019t been there before.\"Keiji, what do you think?\"Keiji was a user who had played the previous game. He had just recently joined Darkness.He had once ranked 2nd. He was a real veteran.Of course, he was only placed 2nd for a short while, but that was enough of a reason to make him an offer to join them.Reina asked for his opinion.\"Is there a chance TarrTarr was an Asra user?\"\"No, that's not possible.\"Keiji shook his head.If he'd been an Asra user, he would've at least ranked 3rd.But he knew the person who'd been ranked 3rd in Asra, and he knew that person had quit playing.Although 2nd place in the rankings varied frequently, the user whom people thought about when talking about 2nd place had already become famous through numerous combat videos through the different community boards.And the 1st\u2026'I'm sure it isn't him.'If he really was level 70, he wouldn't show himself like that.That's if he didn't care about receiving all the hate from ex-Asra users.Considering everything, he was sure TarrTarr was a new Asrian user.\"He's probably the same kind of person as Lattice. Although it seems like he started playing late.\"\"Hmm, I see.\"XL sighed.If what Keiji said was true, they had to make him join them no matter what, but it didn't seem like Mayday was going to bring good news.After thinking for a while, Mayday spoke through the guild chat.\u300cAre you still in the banquet hall, Mayday?\u300d\u300cYes.\u300d\u300cThen try to look for him again. Maybe he's looking for a better deal.\u300dXL calculated the max amount of money Darkness could pay him on the calculator.Once they could make a connection with him, he was sure they'd be able to convince him easily, so he planned to put on as much effort as possible into their first meeting.* * *Hyun stopped thinking.He remembered the second reason why he had participated in the banquet.Although he had received the reward, he still hadn't reached the Abyss Repository, which was the quest's destination.'Time to move.'The Dark Palace\u2026The place, which was the base of the Abyss and was hundreds of meters underground, was so vast that it didn't look like it was underground.\u300cIt's scary\u2026\u300dTarrTarr trembled a little bit after looking at the monsters guarding the different paths.Although the palace was incredibly big, the place users were allowed access to was relatively small.The banquet hall, the waiting room in front of it, and the square.Those were the places users had access to.If you tried to access other places, you would've to face the wrath of high-level monsters.\u300cSo where's the Abyss Repository?\u300dTarrTarr asked since they'd been roaming around the same area for a few minutes.According to Hyun, they'd participated in the tournament so they could access the Abyss Repository.But no matter how much he looked around, he could only see a few shops and non-sensically big sculptures.The only thing worth seeing was a volcanic waterfall curtain.How it poured out from the ceiling and scattered into the depths of the Abyss was so impressive that it was like an art piece that you wouldn't be able to replicate in real life.\u300cWait, it's going to open soon.\u300dWhile TarrTarr was distracted, Hyun was looking at one place.At that moment\u2026As the lava waterfall stopped, the path hidden behind it showed itself.But that place wasn't a place that users could enter.It was a place that was guarded by strong monsters.The moment he did something suspicious, it would become impossible to go through the security.But the current Hyun could do it.'\u00abInvisible\u00bb, \u00abBiorhythm Acceleration\u00bb!'Hyun used both skills and leaped toward the path that had appeared behind the waterfall.Tap-!Because of the step, a weak sound spread through the place.At that moment, the minotaur there turned its head around.\"\u2026\"But it couldn't see anyone.Whoosh-!The monster relaxed after the lava waterfall began falling again.Three seconds had passed.During those seconds, Hyun had moved more than a hundred meters away from there and hid.It was thanks to \u00abBiorhythm Acceleration\u00bb, which increased his speed by 250% for two seconds.\u300cOof, oof\u2026!\u300dIt was for a short while, but TarrTarr felt a speed that was enough to make his vision shake.\u300cI told you to give me a warning before moving!\u300d\u300cSsh, be quiet.\u300dHyun made TarrTarr quiet down.They couldn't relax yet.The Abyss Repository was a place where all of the important information about the Abyss was gathered, so it wasn't a place a user could easily gain access to.If they followed the normal procedures, it would probably take months before they were granted access to it, so that's why Hyun thought of infiltrating the place.\u300cDon't relax yet.\u300dWhile calming down TarrTarr, who was making a big fuss out of it, Hyun prepared to move again.120 seconds\u2026It was the amount of time he had to wait until the cooldown time of \u00abInvisible\u00bb and \u00abBiorhythm Acceleration\u00bb was reset.Paf-!As TarrTarr's figure melted into the air, an invisible race began.While trying to make as little noise as possible\u2026Hyun jumped through the gap between the two minotaurs guarding the path.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\"\u2026!\"Clang-!Both minotaurs crossed their spears and blocked the path.That happened at the same time Hyun was crossing through the middle of them.Even if he tried to make footstep noises as low as possible, he couldn't hide the pressure generated by them.The moment they felt something strange, they'd blocked the pathway.Just before \u00abInvisible\u00bb's time came to an end, Hyun jumped up.\u300cDid we get found out..?\u300d\u300cNo, not yet.\u300dWhile hiding on the ceiling crossbeam, Hyun quietly looked down.It seemed like both monsters were talking about something.After a while, they saw the gate of the passageway opening.Hyun and TarrTarr couldn't understand what they were saying, but the situation seemed positive.\u300cI thought we were found out\u2026\u300d\u300cThere aren't many beings who can see through \u00abInvisible\u00bb. Although if it was a Duke, he'd probably know.\u300dHyun walked along the crossbeam of the palace and moved toward their destination.\u00abInvisible\u00bb lasted for two seconds\u2026But the distance he could move in that time was 200 meters.That meant he could cross the gates without being discovered as long as it wasn't a winding road.Hyun used a giant column and immediately moved up to a high-up equivalent of a 4th floor.Dust that was nearby rose and then settled.Not a single monster was able to see the intruder.The pattern of moving for two seconds and then resting for two minutes kept repeating.As if he were an assassin moving along the ceiling, he sometimes passed through places where humans couldn't.Even while going through an empty engine room, he didn't relax.'TarrTarr has signed a contract with the Duke.'If the Duke wished, he could move to where his knight was.If that happened while he was moving along the palace\u2019s ceiling, he would be in trouble.But he had to leave that to luck.\u300cIt's here.\u300dIt had been 30 minutes since they began moving.Hyun stopped moving at a dead end.\u300cIt's here?\u300dTarrTarr asked.The reason why he was so confused was that the place where they'd arrived was an empty vault.Not only was there not any sort of massive facility, but there wasn't even a monster guarding it.It was a place surrounded by colorless walls.\u300cBut there's nothing\u2026\u300d\u300cYes, that's right. That's why there isn't a risk of being found out.\u300d\u300c\u2026?\u300d\u300cJust keep waiting.\u300dWhile TarrTarr was confused, Hyun began walking slowly toward a wall.And in that state, he used a skill.'\u00abDisassimilation\u00bb.'Paf-The distance for using \u00abAssimilation\u00bb was 20 meters.Hyun's body crossed the wall and reached an empty place.It was also a place where there wasn't anyone, but it wasn't empty.Equipment with complex magic circles drawn on them were spreading remnants of Magical Power.A giant marble ball was floating in the air and drawing a three-dimensional magical circle in the air.This place full of all sorts of other weird things was the place known as Abyss Repository.* * *Duke Bahmir remembered TarrTarr's play.The one he remembered the most was the last battle.The battle between both forces at the satellite Iluna had ended with the Abyss forces losing.According to the historical records, the Abyss army could only resist for about 15 minutes.But thanks to a user taking part in it, the duration of the fight was extended to 60 minutes.He was amazed at how someone who looked so shabby could use his strength in such a skillful way.\"A user\u2026\"Users weren't afraid of dying, and they had unlimited potential.You couldn't judge them by their outer appearance.An extremely small number of users may even surpass him one day.\u2014So he couldn't treat them in the same way as normal people.Rather than punishing them, he had to motivate them with rewards.\"Fufu, I'm going to make sure you don't regret becoming my knight.\"The Duke could use the soul's string to go and find his knight.Bahmir was thinking that he should try to go and see TarrTarr immediately.At that moment, Hyun and TarrTarr were moving to the Abyss Repository.That would be fatal for both of them since they were trying to infiltrate.\"Hmm?\"At that moment, the Duke frowned.One of the guards had sent a signal that said something unexpected had happened in his sector.Bahmir didn't know, but that was one of the traces Hyun had left while trying to infiltrate the Abyss Repository.Lots of suspicious things accumulated, and the tail was eventually revealed.\"Hmm, interesting.\"He had received a detailed report through the soul conversation.Bahmir vaguely understood what was going on in the Dark Palace.\"It seems like someone has infiltrated, but you're not sure who it is?\"The tips of Bahmir's lips raised.\"Is it an agent of the Heavens\u2026? I'm not sure who it is, but since you stepped foot in the Abyss, you better be prepared for the consequences.\"He decided to leave his interest in TarrTarr to the side for a while.It wouldn't be late if he got to him after solving the case.The moment a magic circle was drawn under his feet, he disappeared.* * *The activation of \u00abAssimilation\u00bb didn't depend on sight but on distance.He had penetrated the Abyss Repository's thick walls thanks to that characteristic of \u00abAssimilation\u00bb.'It seems like I found it successfully.'Hyun ignored TarrTarr's complaints and kept walking.Although it was the place where many important items of the Abyss were gathered, Hyun didn't know what everything was.He didn't need to know, either.He only had to follow what the quest mission was saying.- Once you reach the Abyss Repository, search for the magic marble ball.Because the message had very kindly incorporated a picture, it didn't take him long to find it.The magic marble ball was a ball of three meters shaped like a globe.Rather than the earth, there were Asra's lands and seas drawn on the globe.[The magic marble is a weapon that tracks a target with magic!][You have something with magic on it in your inventory!][If you put the medium on the altar, you'll be able to find the target's location!]\"I've found you.\"Hyun smiled with satisfaction.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 - Clue (1)'I think I understand.'From there onwards, Hyun didn't need indications from the quest.Hyun remembered he had received some items from the Knight Commander.The items with magic it was referring to were probably those.'Is this it?'He took out a piece of the skin of a demon and placed it on the altar.But nothing happened.A single message appeared.[The magic on the medium is too weak, so it's impossible to track the soul!]'This isn't it.'Although it\u2019d failed to activate, Hyun wasn't disappointed.He had one more item he had received from the Knight Commander.He took out the monster's claw and put that on the altar.Ziinngg-.At that moment, a small red dot appeared on the globe.Just as if it were a GPS, it pointed to a certain place.The monster\u2019s coordinates were shown thanks to the unique magic emitted by it.\"Huh? What?\" Hyun mumbled after checking out the location of the red dot.\"It's here?\"The red dot was located in the middle of the empire's capital.According to the Knight Commander, that monster had appeared together with a demon and then disappeared.The fact that such a creature was in the capital meant that the entire city was exposed to a possible demon's attack.From the Heaven's point of view, it was clearly a dangerous situation.Who would've thought that a demon would be hiding in their territory?!\"Tsk tsk, they do say that it's darker under the lamp\u2026\"A quest was created.- This is serious. The Empire is in danger! Please tell this to the Knight Commander as soon as possible!- Once you report to him, you'll be known as the one who saved the Empire!The red dot soon disappeared.The magic remaining in the claws had disappeared.Hyun was about to return when something weird happened.\"Oh\u2026 What?\"[There's one more item in your inventory that has been registered in the 'magic marble ball'!][There's one more item in your inventory that has been registered in the 'magic marble ball'!]Although he had finished everything he had to do, he kept receiving that same message.He placed the claws on the altar once again, but nothing happened.It was the same with the skin piece.[There's one more item in your inventory that has been registered in the 'magic marble ball'!]But the message didn't stop.'Was there something else?'While tilting his head, Hyun kept placing all the items related to the Knight Commander on the altar.But there was no reaction from the marble ball.'Wait, maybe?'Hyun, who had thought of something, took out something from his inventory.Louise's necklace\u2026That item he'd found in the Evil's Seed Dungeon was the necklace that the little Louise of five years past had considered very important.\"Ugh\u2026\"Hyun groaned shortly.When he took the necklace out of his inventory, it began vibrating.Whir- Whir-He felt he was going to drop it if he didn't hold onto it tightly.While struggling, he managed to get the necklace close to the altar.Thud-!The altar pulled the necklace to it as if it were a magnet.At the same time, the marble ball activated, and in the Asra globe, a red dot appeared.Ting-![Main Quest, 'In Search of Louise' has been generated!]- You've discovered Louise\u2019s location.Hyun moved forward as if he were possessed.The red dot on the globe was more intense than the one that had appeared when he placed the claws on the altar.\"The\u2026 Sea?\"Amazingly, the place where the dot had appeared wasn't on the land, but in the middle of the vast sea.It was the equivalent of the Pacific Ocean of the Earth.Did that mean that Louise had sunk?Even he, who had been a ranker on the previous game, didn't know about a place hidden in the sea.\"This\u2026 Doesn't make sense.\"Hyun was troubled.Now that he thought about it, Louise was the only one from whom he couldn't get information, even with his knowledge of Asra.When he\u2019d met her, he hadn\u2019t even know her name.At first, he thought she was an extra NPC. But later on, he discovered that she was a Royal ranking Angel.Louise always exceeded his expectations.Then it was possible that, unexpectedly, there was a place hidden in the middle of the ocean that he didn't know about.\"How am I supposed to go there\u2026?\"There probably wasn't a teleportation gate in the ocean.He would run out of mana, even if he learned a flying skill.Should he take a ship?But the world's oceans, unlike Earth's, were full of dangerous monsters.Even if he managed to dodge the monsters, he could be devoured by the sea.'Huh? Wait\u2026'While thinking about how to cross the sea, Hyun suddenly felt that something was strange.He felt that the red dot that was in the middle of the sea was moving.'Didn't it move a little bit?'Because the magic marble globe had the latitude and longitude drawn, it was easy to check the coordinates.At first, the red dot was in the middle of the globe.But after a while, it seemed like it was off the center.'I didn't see it wrong, right?'Hyun waited for a little bit more while standing still.After a while, the red dot kept getting further away from the center.He kept waiting and became sure that it had completely moved away from the center.'It's moving!'If Louise was the red dot, it meant that she was still moving.'Fast\u2026!'Although the scale ratio must\u2019ve been huge, it was easy to see the red dot moving.She was probably moving at a speed of tens of kilometers per second.Was she moving at that speed under the sea? Or on top of it\u2026?Neither option made sense.While thinking for a while, he suddenly felt like a hammer had hit him in the head.'No\u2026 It's possible!'Because the map was made with flat surfaces, you wouldn't know at which height the target was.That's why, up until then, he'd thought that she was under the sea.But what if she wasn't under\u2026 but up?He looked again with a different point of view. That time, he asked himself, \u201cwhat if she was somewhere above?\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *'The moon!'That could explain the mind-bending speed and the strange location of the dot.Yes, there wasn't a place hidden under the sea.He had to look up into the sky.'Which moon is it?'The Earth only had one moon, but Asra had two.No, except for the Empire, a few countries had a satellite made of Magical Power. So there were more options.What was Louise\u2019s orbital path?Hyun grabbed his head and thought about it again.More than ten minutes had passed since he started watching the red dot, when\u2026Bang!The door of the Abyss Repository opened while making a strong noise.The noise of monsters\u2019 footsteps started to spread through the room.'Oh, damn\u2026!'Hyun quickly put the necklace away.He leaped toward the wall from where he'd come.Grrr-! While leaving behind the cry of monsters, he used his skill.\u00abAssimilation\u00bb!Just as if he had suddenly appeared, he quickly disappeared.The monsters entered the Abyss Repository after that.A few moments later, even Bahmir arrived.\"You didn't catch the intruder?\"Bahmir got angry after receiving the report.\"There's no place to escape from here. Find the intruder!\"In the Abyss Repository, teleport magics were blocked.But what Bahmir didn't consider was that \u00abAssimilation\u00bb worked in a completely different way from teleportation-type skills.That's why they couldn't find him, no matter how much they searched.\"What about traces?\"\"That\u2026 over here\u2026!\"The only thing clear was that someone had infiltrated the Abyss Repository.There had been records of someone using the magic marble ball.At Bahmir's orders, they began looking at the search records.According to the record, the tracking magic had been used twice.Bahmir frowned after looking at the records.\"It was clearly an agent from the Heavens.\"There was a red dot on the magic marble ball.Now he understood what was going on.It seemed like the one who had infiltrated had discovered the existence of the monster that was hidden in the Empire's capital.That was a plan that tens of Dukes had been planning for a while.The location of the monster that was as strong as a demon had been discovered.\"I should order for it to retreat immediately.\"\"Then the plan\u2026\"\"Discarded.\"How they'd lost a great chance would affect the Dukes negatively. But now that they'd been found out, it was better if they retreated.'What's the second one?'According to the record, the infiltrator had tried to search the location of another thing.The problem was that even Bahmir didn't know what that was.The identity of the presence that was in the middle of the sea\u2026\"Is it\u2026 One of the Transcendents?\"Because of the strange location, there was a huge chance that the dot was a demon.But he didn't know who from the Heavens had gotten an item of the Transcendent and why that person was trying the location of a demon.Bahmir's thoughts deepened, and his eyes narrowed.* * *[You've canceled the large-scale event 'Gray Invation'!][All your stats have increased by +7!]As soon as he exited the Abyss Repository, Hyun got more than one notification.[Because of your actions, your tendency has changed!][You've gotten closer to the Abyss. (Current Tendency: -83)]Hyun felt suspicious.If he'd canceled the Abyss's plans while doing the Knight Commander's quest, shouldn't he get closer to the Heavens?At first, he thought that it was a system error, But he soon concluded that was impossible.Louise's quest.The so-called main quest was so influential that it was able to overwrite the Knight Commander's quest influence and dragged him closer to the Abyss.\u300cMy tendency started to change!\u300dTarrTarr shouted.Because he hadn't influenced it, he didn't receive the achievement bonus.But just because he'd provided a tiny help, TarrTarr's tendency had changed by a huge margin.[You've gone a little bit away from the 'Heavens.' (Current Tendency: 11)]The tendency of the user changed a little bit depending on the actions.But TarrTarr's tendency had gotten cut in half.That was enough to know how influential Louise's quest was.'Louise\u2026'Hyun tried to remember details about her.Even back then, his tendency changed when he got entangled with her.After all, he had ended up as a member of the Abyss because of her.Five years ago, after helping Louise escape, he changed history and, thanks to that, received lots of stats and skill points.'What's her real identity?'In the end, both hidden quests he had received from the Knight Commander were related to her.Also, the quest that asked him to go and search for her was called a main quest.It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that she was at the center of all incidents.But even then, he didn't know her identity.In the Evil's Seed Dungeon, he saw her as an angel.She wasn't an Archangel but a Royal ranking Angel. Then how could she have such a big influence?Also, if Louise was indeed an Angel, why was it that every time he got involved with her, his tendency got closer to the Abyss?'I guess I'll discover the answer once I meet her.'Even while moving away from that sector, Hyun's head was not easily unraveled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 - Clue (2)After TarrTarr disappeared, Mayday left the banquet hall and was looking for him.The Guild's leader, XL, had improved the conditions and had asked her to try to make a new deal with him.When she heard the amount of money, her first thought was that if he really was worth that ridiculous sum of money.But after thinking about it, she concluded that it was a fair deal.'Well, we indeed do not have lots of Thieves, so if we could make one with great control and abilities, the potential of Darkness would increase a lot!'Although TarrTarr's level was low, that wouldn't be a problem with the guild's support.It shouldn't be hard to cover him with rare and unique items. And with the speed at which he hunted, it shouldn't take him long to catch up.Although admitting it hurt her pride, she thought his growth potential was probably higher than hers.'Where is he?'She exited the banquet hall and roamed around but couldn't find TarrTarr.The only places users were allowed to in the Dark Palace were the banquet hall and the square in front of it.There was no reason for him to be that hard to find.'Maybe he already left...?'Mayday started to become impatient.Users who had received an invitation to the Dark Palace not only checked it out but also needed to check out the 'medal' and 'token' shops.Since he\u2019d won the first tournament, he probably needed more time than the rest.'He isn't anywhere!'Even though she'd searched for him everywhere, she couldn't find TarrTarr.There weren't many users who'd been invited to the Dark Palace, so the chance of her looking past him was slim.Mayday quickly ran toward the return portal.There, she saw a familiar face.\"Huh, why are you here...\"Berard was in front of the gate as if he were a guard.\"Fufu, Mayday. It seems like you also want to make a new proposal! But be prepared for it because we're also going to offer him good conditions.\"\"What are you saying?!\"The moment she saw Mayday, he understood the situation.TarrTarr had already left the Dark Palace!By Berard's reaction, she assumed that he'd been waiting for him in front of the gate from the moment he left the banquet hall.Despite that, they hadn't been able to meet each other.That meant he had really left the Dark Palace without looking around!'Was he serious when he said he preferred playing solo...?!'Mayday and all the other executives of Darkness thought he'd said that to get a better deal.They weren't expecting him to leave so easily.Mayday could feel the strength leaving her body.A few moments later, she just used the return portal and left.Berard's eyes narrowed after seeing that.'What... Why did she do that?'He suddenly began feeling uneasy.Berard, who felt something was off, started looking around the banquet hall and lobby.Obviously, it was to find TarrTarr, but just like her, he couldn't find him.\"Damn...! This means that he already left this place!\"Berard also clenched his teeth and left through the return portal.If TarrTarr really couldn't understand what the proposal was worth because he was still a kid, he had to find a way to contact him faster than Darkness.After a few minutes, the one whom those two were looking for appeared in the square in front of the banquet hall.The party organized by the Duke was still going on.\u300cOof, we made it in time!\u300d\u300cLet's look around. There seem to be many cool-looking things around here. Also, it seems like there are many interesting shops outside.\u300d\u300cEven if you didn't say it, I was planning on doing that.\u300dTasting the delicacies that Asrian had to offer was one of the things Hyun enjoyed the most since the game had even recreated the sense of taste.He spent the remaining time checking out the items for sale in the square in front of the banquet hall.He used the medals and tokens obtained as a reward for winning to buy some items. While doing that, an hour passed.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The next day\u2026Once again, SeoHyun was with JaeHoon, who was inviting lunch as a form of payment for the classes. No, for the advice given.The $50,000 USD he had gotten from Jini was in his bank account, and there was a chance that he would be able to earn millions with the videos uploaded, but he had no reason to refuse free lunch.'So today's menu is sashimi...'Even while eating, SeoHyun kept thinking about the previous day\u2019s play.While doing a Heaven's quest, he had received a hint about Louise, but he hadn't been able to solve it.He'd sent the footage of the gameplay to his smartphone. Even though he watched it whenever he had free time, he hadn't been able to find an answer.\"What are you looking at?\" JaeHoon asked him since he was looking at his smartphone even while eating.\"Hmm, it's just that there's something bothering me. You see, what happened is...\"SeoHyun explained what had happened.Some parts of the story surprised JaeHoon, and others made him laugh.The story soon reached the part related to Louise.He hadn't told them everything in a detailed way, but JaeHoon understood why SeoHyun was so deeply immersed in his thoughts.\"So you need to find someone, but you don't know in which moon that person is, Right?\"\"Yes. Getting to one of them is hard in itself and takes a long time... So I can't go to both.\"JaeHoon wasn't surprised after hearing about the world outside of the planet.After incorporating an ex-Asra player, Stardust had obtained tons of information, and the fact that there were worlds outside of the planet was something that had been spread through numerous community boards.\"So this is that moon\u2019s movement.\"\"Yes.\"SeoHyun showed the recorded footage to JaeHoon.It was a marble ball that recreated Asra's surface. The red dot was moving as if it were a GPS.The red dot's movement became clear as the video's speed increased.Hyun was about to put his smartphone away when JaeHoon, who had been watching the video closely, smiled.\"I think I know where that is.\"\"What?\"\"The moon you're looking for. I think I know which one it is.\"\"R-really? How?!\"SeoHyun finished eating a piece of sashimi he had in his mouth and got closer to JaeHoon.While smiling, JaeHoon said.\"You can know its trajectory by looking at the traces.\"JaeHoon continued his explanation.The position of the red dot changed depending on the movement of Asra and the orbit of the moon.So by tracking the traces of the red dot, they could calculate the moon\u2019s orbit.To be honest, SeoHyun didn't understand what JaeHoon was saying very well, but he knew that JaeHoon had always been good at math and physics.JaeHoon began explaining while increasing the reproduction speed of the video.\"If there are two variables, the orbit and rotation, then the trace should change both longitude and latitude, but right now, only the longitude is changing.\"\"...?\"Before SeoHyun became more confused, JaeHoon simplified the explanation.\"The target moon isn't orbiting around Asra. To be more precise, the moon and Asra have the same orbiting speed.\"\"...?\"\"From what I know, there's exactly one moon like that.\"JaeHoon thought about the information of the Asra world he'd seen in the Stardust's database.He'd been fascinated for a while about Asra's world, which was just as vast as the real world, but at the same time, different.Even among those, he couldn't forget about a very peculiar moon.\"The land of the eclipse, Iluna.\"That was the name of that peculiar moon.The sun, Asra, and Iluna were always in a straight line.That phenomenon was why there were lots of solar eclipses in Iluna.The reason why Asra's people called Iluna the 'Phantom Land' was that since it didn't reflect the sunlight, you couldn't see it, even at night.'Eclipse...?'After hearing JaeHoon's explanation, lightning flashed in Hyun's mind.He couldn't understand all the complex words, but the moment he heard the word \u201cEclipse\u201d, he remembered something.'That's right. Why didn't I think of that?'The day they were being chased by the masked enemies, Louise told him she had a curse while making a sad smile.Stigma of Light\u2026It was a magic that made your location known the moment sunlight touched your skin.It was a magic from which you could be freed from only after death. However, there were some NPCs with very specific skills that could help.'Iluna is a place that isn't reached by the sunlight!'He knew from first-hand experience that in Iluna, eclipses happened very often.He blamed himself for not having thought about something so obvious.As the entangled threads untied, the whole picture began to fit.All the clues he\u2019d missed\u2026The only place in the world where the sun didn't reach was beneath the ground.But since the Abyss's base was beneath the ground, Louise couldn't stay there for a long time.After all, angels belonged to the skies.Iluna was probably the only place where Louise could stay.\"JaeHoon, I think you're right...! You really are a genius!\"\"Huh...? O-okay. I'm glad...\"JaeHoon was surprised by Hyun's sudden change of atmosphere but smiled with him.The first moment they talked to each other with Asrian as a topic, there was a weird atmosphere between them. But right then, Hyun and JaeHoon had become real friends that enjoyed talking about the game.JaeHoon was the only person with whom Hyun talked about doubts he had regarding the game. Not only that, but JaeHoon had no intentions of using the knowledge Hyun had taught him in his gaming team.Seeing his friend smile because his doubt was solved made him feel good, which made him smile.* * *Asrian's developer, Robert Connor, was once again spending time while sitting down.Technically speaking, his job was solving bugs or reacting when something urgent happened, but since day one, there hadn't been an error, so it was as if he was being paid for playing around.Except for Robert and Mary, most developers didn't show up to work if there wasn't a patch or something urgent that needed to be done.'Finally...!'With great interest, Robert looked at Hyun, who had infiltrated the Abyss Repository.The magic marble ball reacted at Louise's necklace, and the moment the red dot showed in it, he could feel his heart beating faster.'I guess he'll soon realize what moon that dot is pointing towards... He'll probably realize it immediately.'Robert believed Hyun was going to guess it correctly because he thought he was a very intelligent player.Then his next destination would be Iluna.'So it's going to happen like this?'Mary approached Robert, who had a serious expression on his face.\"It seems like you've seen something interesting.\"\"Yes. Mary, I'm sure you're going to find it interesting too. Check this out.\"Robert could see the current location of influential NPCs and users.Since he was a developer, he could see all actions of NPCs and users at one glance.\"Oh...!\"Mary exclaimed after looking at the screen.According to the information, many important figures were gathered in Iluna or they were planning to go there.Those were all beings that could influence the world.Even a few Transcendents were interested in it!Mary clapped after noticing something.\"Now that I think about it, Lattice is at Iluna right now!\"\"Exactly. This means that something big is about to happen.\"\"Interesting! Is war about to happen?\"\"Maybe... Haha, I'll show you another interesting thing.\"Robert changed the screen again and put on the screen information related to Keidrial.One of the most influential NPCs, the Great Demon of Deception.Robert was very interested in the relationship between Keidrial and Hyun.After looking through much information, he discovered that Keidrial had shown a very peculiar action pattern since the beginning.And he confirmed that once more.The moment Hyun discovered Iluna, she suddenly became interested in it too.All her actions were in some way related to Hyun.\"This demon again\u2026 Is she somehow resentful to him?\"\"Because the data of the Transcendents is so vast, it's hard to analyze them. So I'm not sure about that. I guess we're going to discover it soon if we keep watching.\"Robert's only role currently was eating the meals provided by the company.But still, he was happy because he was never bored.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 - Ain's Transformation (1)\"I never imagined that there was a monster hidden in the middle of the city! I'll immediately send people to investigate!\"[The affection rate of Knight Commander Ollie has increased a lot!][If he trusts you, all the other people in the Empire will recognize you too!][You've obtained rewards!]- Heaven's Medal of Honor X 15- All Stats +6- The Empire's Knight Commander's Necklace\"Once again, you have my thanks! If it weren't for you, a great crisis would've come in the Empire's way!!\"As soon as Hyun logged in, he went to the Knight's Hall and received the reward for completing the quest.But receiving the rewards wasn't the only reason he had gone there. There was another reason.Hyun asked him the same question as before.\"Commander, with this\u2026 Do you recognize me\u2026?\"The Knight Commander's answer changed from before.\"To be honest, I was a little bit suspicious about you. It was because your partner was too good, but my thoughts have changed. You're also someone very exceptional.\"[The Knight Commander Ollie trusts you 100%!][Will you accept his blessing and change jobs? Y/N]Hyun didn't immediately accept and fell deep into thought.According to the quest's explanation, the stronger the NPC from which he received the recognition, the better.The Knight Commander's level was 400. It was quite high.It didn't matter where he went. Being recognized by a level 400 NPC would be hard.'I don't need to change jobs immediately. Right?'Even considering that, Hyun decided to push the job ascension back.After thinking of going to Iluna, he changed his thoughts slightly.'I guess I'll be able to meet a Heavenly Being easily. Maybe even an Angel\u2026'Even though the Knight Commander was clearly a high-ranking NPC, he ranked lower compared to a Heavenly Being.If he compared him to an Angel, a Transcendent being, the quality dropped even more.Hyun thought that Louise would've gotten very strong those past five years.Since he'd helped her before, it should be easy to be recognized by her. Right?Hyun felt that the issue would be solved once he met her.'Okay, I should start moving!'Hyun received the reward and left the Knight Commander's room, then he sent Ain a message through Whisper.\u300cAin, once you're done with what you're doing, come to the Knight's Hall. It's finally time for us to start moving!\u300dHe thought if he should send TarrTarr a Whisper, but he decided not to do that.The footage would probably be better if the editor recorded it, but TarrTarr had lots of things to do at the moment.He had to finish editing the new videos, and if he wanted to change forces on top of that, he would need time.\"Hyun, I'm here!\"Hyun was surprised at the voice he suddenly heard and turned around.Ain was behind him. smiling.\"Woah\u2026 You came really fast! It hasn't even been a minute since I sent you a message!\"\"It just happened that I was around here.\"\"Really\u2026?\"Now that he thought about it, there was something he needed to tell Ain.First, he had a short conversation with her, but it seemed like she hadn't heard anything related to the tournament through the community boards.Even while playing Asra, Ain wasn't interested at all in the community boards, so it wasn't strange for her not to know what had happened.'It should be okay if I talk to her about it. Right?'Hyun tried to bring out the other day's topic once more.That topic was uploading videos!Ain had said that she didn't want to show herself\u2026 But maybe that was because she didn't know about Asrian's potential very well.'Maybe she's changed her opinion.'He thought it was too bad that they could be earning hundreds or even millions per month, but they weren't doing anything at all.It wasn't only because of his ambition, but it was also for her.Hyun began talking about the logical reasons he'd been thinking and preparing for about three hours.But after saying a few words to change the topic, he could see Ain's smile deepening.Ain talked about it first.\"Hyun\u2026 You're trying to talk again about uploading gameplay footage to YouTube. Right?\"\"How did you\u2026 Wait, but I haven't reached that point yet\u2026\"\"If you want to do it, I don't mind.\"\"R-really\u2026?!\"Hyun did his best not to smile.But he couldn't hide it from leaking.There was no need to say all the excuses he had prepared before.Who would've thought that it would be solved so easily?While Hyun was smiling, Ain said something.\"But\u2026!\"Hyun took a deep breath.Finally, she was about to bring that topic out.It was obviously about the money. Right?But what Ain said was totally unexpected to Hyun.\"Record the video, so that your face doesn't appear in it.\"\"Me\u2026? Not you?\"\"Yes.\"Hyun tilted his head at Ain's weird condition.If she cared about privacy, shouldn't she have asked to hide her own face\u2026?He thought maybe he'd heard wrong, but it was just like he had understood.'She's saying we should only upload footage where I'm using \u00abAssimilation\u00bb?'That wasn't something hard to do because, in most cases, since he was a Support, he was using \u00abAssimilation\u00bb.But more than that, how they would distribute the money was more important.\"Another condition\u2026?\"\"Hmm, that we upload mostly videos where you're using \u00abAssimilation\u00bb on me\u2026?\"\"What about the money generated from the videos?\"\"That\u2026 Do it as you see fit.\"Surprisingly, Ain had left the money distribution to him.Hyun had a hard time controlling his facial expression, but thankfully, he was able to hide it.'This is a perfect opportunity to take a huge cut\u2026'For a while, he became overly ambitious, but he soon shook his head.He didn't want to ruin the relationship he'd built with her just because of money.'No. I'd rather split fairly. If we take out TarrTarr's part\u2026'TarrTarr had a huge debt with him.According to his calculations, he wouldn't need to pay TarrTarr for a very long time.Even considering that he split the profits in half for each, it would be settled in 55 to 45.After settling that matter quickly, Hyun nodded while making a serious face.\"Okay. Ain, I'll give you 45% from all the videos where you appear. Because we need to pay our editor, it isn't going to be exactly half.\"Ain nodded without thinking about it.Hyun was excited. He immediately sent a whisper to TarrTarr.\u300cHey, TarrTarr, I have an extra job for you! Maybe we could make about 20 videos. I'll send you the footage, so categorize it and edit it as you consider it best.\u300dHe could hear TarrTarr agonizing as an answer, but Hyun was in a good mood because he'd been able to make a deal very easily, so he changed the settings so whispers wouldn't reach him.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *'Should we start moving\u2026?'After he was done with the preparations, his head again became full of thoughts about the quest.Hyun told Ain that he was going to Iluna.Ain seemed excited to hear that.\"Then we're going on a trip?!\"\"Are you coming?\"\"Obviously. Isn't it better for you too if I come?\"\"That's true\u2026\"Once again, Ain replied without hesitation.Honestly, it would be more beneficial for her to try to level up while staying in the Knight's Hall.Wouldn't going together with him to help be detrimental to her?\"If you help me with my quest\u2026 Maybe it will slow down your growth.\"\"That's okay.

    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 - Ain's Transformation (2)\"That guy was being searched for being an assassin\u2026 Even if I had left him alone, he would've been executed soon.\"\"Hmm\u2026\"Even after listening to that explanation, it took Hyun a while to calm down.The face of the soldier who took his own life in the Virtual Historical Battle came to mind.Just before he was ripped apart by the undead, the expression he had while piercing his own stomach with a sword was as if\u2026\"Hyun\u2026?\"Ain asked after seeing that Hyun's expression had darkened.\"It's nothing, don't worry.\"After listening to Ain's voice, Hyun came back to his senses; then he smiled while shaking his head.* * *Iluna.It was a land you couldn't reach unless you crossed space.You couldn't even reach it with teleport.To move across space, you needed a new magic called \u00abWarp\u00bb, but that wasn't one you could easily encounter.The second best option after \u00abWarp\u00bb was using a shuttle.Even though you could use the Shuttle to move through space, at that point of the game, that was something reserved only for high-ranking NPCs.The reason was that the ticket was too expensive.Maybe things would change in the future once inflation devalued the price of gold.It would be a completely different story if he used real-life money\u2026 But Hyun had no intentions of doing something so crazy.'But it isn't like there's no way.'Hyun, master of tricks, once again found a hole.'If I can use a Heavenly Being\u2026'A Heavenly Being was someone who belonged to the sky.All people that belonged to the Heavens looked up to and worshipped the Heavenly Beings.With the help of a Heavenly Being, obtaining a shuttle ticket would be easy.'It would be great if the title worked\u2026 But I guess it's still too early.'The problem was that they weren't strong enough at the moment to be perceived as Heavenly Beings by NPCs.In fact, one NPC had referred to Ain as someone whom a Heavenly Being had recognized.What they needed at the moment wasn't the title 'Heavenly Being,' but the strength of one.Thankfully, Hyun had a triumph card: his knowledge of Asra.He knew the best places to hunt, all kinds of hidden pieces, Asra's history, and the most important NPCs, among many other things.But more than that, he had the most relevant information about the Interloop saved in his capsule's memory.Hyun was planning to use all that to reach Iluna.\"It really suits you.\"Ain had changed her appearance just like Hyun had asked her to.If she refused, he was planning to search for another way to do it, but Ain accepted it without hesitation.The face and body size remained almost the same.But since her hairstyle had changed to a round bob, her atmosphere had changed quite a bit.\"So\u2026 How does it look?\"\"It looks good.\"Hyun brushed off Ain's reaction and logged into the capsule's hard drive.On the image taken from the hard drive, there was the image of an NPC that resembled Ain.'They look almost identical.'Not only was their outer appearance similar, but the clothes were very alike too.Because she was wearing white clothes, unlike the black robes she usually wore, Ain looked like a novice Priest apprentice.\"Who is she? I remember seeing her somewhere.\"\"Huh? She's an NPC from Asra.\"\"Hmm\u2026 I'm glad she isn't a user.\"Ain was looking over her shoulder at Hyun's image.While trying to ignore her, Hyun used \u00abAssimilation\u00bb and hid inside Ain's body.For some reason, he felt awkward looking at her.Ain also didn't question Hyun, and she remained calm, so nothing else happened.'So it's here.'After walking for a while, Hyun and Ain reached a place.\u2014The Forest of the Giants.In that place where everything was big, the trees were so tall that they seemed to pierce the sky.That place, which was as if it was forbidden for humans to enter, was a land ignored by both the Heavens and the Abyss.No one knew the reason why everything there was so big.They only knew that place as somewhere where giant monsters lived.In terms of level, monsters around the area were at a range between 200 and 300. But because they had the characteristic of being very big, they were stronger than other monsters of the same level.Despite that, they didn't give more experience, so the place was bad for hunting because of the poor effectiveness. Except for a few users doing quests, most users didn't come around that area.There was one reason why Hyun had gone there:The Forest of Giants was one of the few places where you could meet a 'Heavenly Being.''\u00abPowerless Wave\u00bb, \u00abImpact Amplification\u00bb.'While assimilated, Hyun used both skills.Two auras began spreading around Ain.Because he'd used two buff skills on top of \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, Ain's damage output had increased around three or four times.After finishing the preparations, Hyun explained the plan to Ain.\u300cYou remember, right? From now on, everything will depend on your acting skills.\u300d\u300cI just have to grab the attention of the Heavenly Being, right?\u300d\u300cExactly.\u300dThe way Hyun was planning to do that was by fishing.But rather than catching a fish, they were planning to catch a Heavenly Being.The reason Hyun had been the number one in Asra by an overwhelming difference wasn't only because his gaming sense was good.He knew how to use even tiny information most users would've missed.There probably weren't many users that knew so much about the main NPCs other than him.According to his expectations, the Heavenly Being would end up falling for the trap.'He probably\u2026 Won't be able to ignore it.'While holding his breath, Hyun was waiting for something to happen.Stomp- Stomp-!Soon, the sound of huge footsteps could be heard along with the rumble of the ground.The monster that had appeared in front of them was a giant wolf.Just at first glance, it seemed bigger than four meters. Imagining how big it was once it stood up would frighten anyone.\u300cAin, I'm going to leave it to you.\u300d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Hyun just looked at Ain from the inside.The reason why they'd gone there wasn't to gain experience. After all, that place was lackluster in terms of hunting efficiency.'It would be better if I stayed still, right?'He'd clearly felt it the other day in the Knight's Hall.His acting skill was horrible compared to other people.From there onward, he had to leave things to Ain.Fwoosh-.Two giant claws appeared on Ain's hands.The claws, which were so big that they seemed grotesque, looked like weapons that were designed to fight a giant from the beginning.Now she could use \u00abEfreet's Claw\u00bb without using her ultimate attack.On top of that, she'd gotten a new skill.\u00abLatent Potential Increase\u00bb.Ain's HP instantly dropped to 20%.A bloody atmosphere spread throughout her entire body.It was a scene that happened as the Elemental Berserker's Magical Power exploded.In that state, Ain looked at the giant wolf.The wolf immediately began attacking.The moment its claws whipped through the air, Ain's claws hit its body.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 59291 damage!]'Hmm\u2026?'Hyun blinked after reading the system message.'She can deal around 60,000 damage in one hit\u2026?'Usually, the giant monsters were very resistant to hits, so it was hard to damage them with an average attack.After making some calculations, he understood why the unreasonably high damage had occurred.'It's because of the buffs.'The monster's ability to take hits came from its high defense.But thanks to \u00abPowerless Wave\u00bb, its defense became 0, so its biggest strength had disappeared.On top of that, there was the buff of \u00abImpact Amplification\u00bb, which doubled the attack, and the Elemental Berserker's own buffs. All of that made the damage output incredibly high.Boom-! While Hyun couldn't hide his surprise, intangible energy came from Ain's body.Thanks to \u00abVitality Absorption\u00bb, she kept recovering HP, and thanks to that, she could keep using the \u00abLatent Potential Increase\u00bb.2nd overlap, 80% Magical Power increase!Boom-!3rd overlap, 120%!Even after the Magical Power had increased at its maximum, her specs kept changing.Ain had two types of \u00abLatent Potential Increase\u00bb. One was the one that increased her Magical Power, and the other one increased her Agility.She could increase her Agility up to 30%, 60%, and finally 90%!In just a few seconds, she overlapped her skills six times.Ain was soon covered by thick, bloody energy.The scene of her slaughtering a wolf while covered in a mad aura really made her look like a Berserker, the mad warrior.\u300cI'm asking just in case, but you know we didn't come here to hunt. Right?\u300d\u300cOh, yeah\u2026!\u300d\u300c\u2026?\u300dAin almost deviated from the original plan. But she soon remembered the goal and stopped her momentum.According to Hyun, the first step was staging a crisis.Ain kept making noise until a large group of monsters gathered.It didn't take her long before a group of predators surrounded her.If she were an average user, death would be imminent.'It's kind of strange\u2026'Hyun's eyes narrowed.Although they were surrounded by monsters, he wasn't feeling any sense of danger.He soon understood the reason.Because Ain's Agility was too high, she couldn't fake a scene as if she were in danger.The weakest point of the giant monsters was their mobility.But Ain didn't allow them to attack, so a dangerous situation didn't come.\u300cTry to act as if you are in danger\u2026\u300d\u300cThere's no way I'd be in danger with just this.\u300d\u300cThat's why I said just act as if you were in danger.\u300d\u300cWell, I'll try it.\u300dAfter saying that, Ain suddenly stopped moving.She didn't dodge the incoming attack.After receiving an attack from the tail of a giant anaconda, her body flew into the air.[You've received 9159 damage!]After receiving a huge hit, she flew about 50 meters, and then she hit the tree and rolled on the floor.Cough! Even the scene of vomiting blood was perfect.\u2014Even though a user wouldn't receive such a realistic wound.\u300cWhat's that\u2026?\u300d\u300cTomato juice. I saw it being sold on the market.\u300d\u300c\u2026\u300d\u300cPerfect, see?\u300dBecause of \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, Hyun could taste the flavor of the tomato juice.While he was tasting it, he began feeling uneasy.Maybe her acting skills were worse than his?Maybe she'd been lucky at the Knight's Hall when she\u2019d convinced the guards. Perhaps it would have been better if he'd played this role.While he was thinking that\u2026Whish-!All the monsters froze in an instant.After a while, the monsters became icy dust and scattered away.A man's footsteps could be heard from inside the forest that had recovered its peace.The moment Hyun saw his face, he subconsciously clenched his fists.\"So you didn't die.\"The man mumbled while looking at Ain.He was very tall. Even though he was only wearing a robe with white and blue colors, he looked very dignified.It was their first time meeting him since they\u2019d started playing Asrian.* * *All the people who belonged to the Heavens served the Angels and looked up to the Heavenly Beings.The Angels were Transcendents\u2014they were above humans.But the Heavenly Beings, except for their life span and physical abilities, were very similar to humans.The Heavenly Beings ate and drank just like humans. Not only that, but they also felt human emotions and formed families.It was the same for the Heavenly Being Radiette.Radiette's past was famous among Asra users.The reason was that Radiette's side story had appeared once as an event quest.<Radiette's Lover>According to the story, Radiette's lover was surprisingly a human that belonged to the Abyss.And she wasn't a normal human, but a Duke.That was obviously a forbidden relationship.After the Heavens decided to have her executed, Radiette rebelled against the Heavens but ended up being sentenced to 100 years in prison.At first, he\u2019d received a 150 years sentence, but he had always been someone very dignified and had achieved many things for the Heavens, so they\u2019d reduced his sentence.After that, he\u2019d gone to the Giant's Forest, a place where something like forces didn't exist, and that is where he lived for another 100 years.But one day\u2026A scene melted his feelings that had been frozen.'What's up with this noise?'The senses of a Heavenly Being transcended the ones of a human being.Was a dull human trying to cross the Giant's Forest again?At first, he\u2019d planned to ignore it.But he was surprised after looking at where the noise was coming from.The person in the middle of the monsters was a young girl.The girl resembled someone from his past from hundreds of years ago.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 - Iluna's Unexpected Event (1)Radiette took a deep breath.Now that he looked at her closely, it wasn't just the face that was similar.The girl wore clothes very similar to those she'd worn until the last moments.\u2018Did she really come back to life\u2026?\u2019For a moment, Radiette thought about some things that didn't make sense but soon began laughing bitterly while shaking his head.'There's no way.'A human that had died 200 years ago couldn't return to life.The person over there fighting the monsters was someone who just happened to be very similar to her.'Nothing will change\u2026'Radiette tried to ignore her, but he couldn't.Suddenly, the girl received an attack from a giant monster and ended up rolling on the ground.At that moment\u2026Radiette, who had decided to turn away his attention, was suddenly moving toward the surface.Whish-! The moment the Heavenly Being went into action, the ground froze.Silence\u2026Save for one place, cold air seemed to envelop the entire world.\"\u2026\"The girl\u2026 No, Ain, was looking at Radiette, who had suddenly appeared.\u300cI've forgotten\u2026 What was next?\u300d\u300cWhat you're good at, fight!\u300d\u300cOh yeah, that's right\u2026!\u300dOnce again, just like Hyun had told her, she began acting.Fwoosh-! Ain activated \u00abEfreet's Claw\u00bb and charged toward Radiette.It obviously didn't work.A Heavenly Being was someone that was just under a Transcendent.There was no way a user who had just completed the first job ascension could face one.Ain's attack, which had been slaughtering giant monsters, whipped the air.Although she had used \u00abLatent Potential Increase\u00bb, she couldn't even touch the tips of his clothes.Radiette dodged the attack while twisting his body a little bit as if he were walking.He didn't even counterattack.\"It's useless.\"After discovering that normal attacks didn't work, Ain changed her attack pattern.Ain faked moving back; then rushed back in.\u00abSteps of the Incarnate\u00bb.The new skill she'd learned after the job ascension let her reduce the distance between her and a target that was within 30 meters.The moment she charged in, she used \u00abEfreet's Claws\u00bb to smash him!Even Radiette couldn't dodge that attack.\"I told you that it's useless.\"Radiette grabbed Ain's giant claws with a very calm expression on his face.Tsss- The claws that\u2019d been burning as if they were lava suddenly cooled down.\"Tsk\u2026!\"Ain quickly disabled the attack and then activated it again.At the same time, as if one had poured oil into a fire, heat began coming out from the claws.\u2014But it went off immediately.Radiette had grabbed the claws and covered them with cold air.\u300cHyun, use those!\u300dHe understood Ain's words and immediately used his skills.\u00abInvisible\u00bb, \u00abAcceleration\u00bb.As the two skills activated, Ain's figure became invisible.Oof\u2026 But Radiette sighed and closed his eyes.\"Okay, if you aren't planning to stop, then just do as you wish.\"Radiette stood still and received all of the attacks.Pow Pow Pow-\u00a0In just a few seconds, tens of attacks hit him.Thanks to the combined effect of \u00abLatent Potential\u00bb Increase and \u00abBiorhythm Acceleration\u00bb, it looked like Ain was moving at the speed of light.[You've received 319 damage!][You've received 304 damage!]Surprisingly, every time Ain attacked, it was she who received the damage.The heat of the flames seeped into Radiette's protective shield and turned into nothing.Every time she hit the protective shield, the cold air ended up burning Ain's hands.[You've received 299 damage!]\"It doesn't matter what you do. It's just going to hurt you\u2026\"A few moments later, the effects of \u00abInvisible\u00bb and \u00abAcceleration\u00bb deactivated, but Ain kept attacking.\u2014She was moving and attacking just as Hyun had told her.The reason why she was suddenly attacking Radiette was because of event footage he'd seen while playing Asra.The Heavenly Being and the Duke\u2026The first encounter between the two was just like this.Hundreds of years ago, Radiette had once stood still and received all of the attacks of a woman.\u2014Until that woman got tired.\"Oof\u2026\"Ain, who was just harming herself, kept attacking until her HP had almost plummeted.Hyun frowned at the slight sense of pain.Inside the game, the pain you felt was reduced to almost nothing, but if your HP plummeted to the bottom, you started feeling sore.Ain stopped attacking, and then, finally, Radiette opened his mouth again.\"Are you satisfied? Return. There's no need to fight in this place, girl from the Abyss who controls the fire.\"Fire and Wind were elements of the Abyss.Radiette had said that because Ain was covered by fire and a bloody-red light.Ain corrected Radiette's misunderstanding.\"I'm not part of the Abyss.\"\"What do you mean\u2026?\"\"Do you want to check it out?\"The moment Ain took off one of her gloves, a rune that belonged to the Heavens appeared.That rune, which was more defined and had stronger Magical Power than the normal ones, was one that represented the Heavenly Beings.Radiette, known for being always calm, was surprised, and his eyes widened.\"A\u2026 Heavenly Being?\"Radiette's confusion deepened.Since the girl had used fire to attack him the moment she\u2019d seen him, he\u2019d thought that the girl obviously belonged to the Abyss's Forces.But if she wasn\u2019t a member of the Abyss, then why did she attack him?His confusion was soon cleared.What Radiette heard next was something he\u2019d never expected to hear.\"I wanted to know how strong a Heavenly Being is.\"\"What\u2026!\"The girl's answer matched the voice of that day hundreds of years ago.In the past, Radiette had heard that same answer to the same question.How did the girl in front of him know about that?!'I should be the only one who knows about that day\u2026'No one knew the details of their past.There was no chance that she had told others what had happened.Radiette's eyes began notably shaking after a girl who resembled her started to talk as if she remembered that moment.Only after calming down could he open his mouth again.\"You were wondering how strong a Heavenly Being is\u2026? Aren't you one yourself?\"\"I'm a user.\"\"User\u2026?\"\"Yes, I became a Heavenly Being by pure chance\u2026 I'm not a real one like you.\"Radiette's eyes began shining after hearing Ain's answer.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Although he had been cut off from the world for hundreds of years, he knew about the prophecy that said that users would appear.They were basically people from another world.If she was a user, maybe she could see the world from a third-person perspective, one that was inclined towards neither the Heavens nor the Abyss.Radiette asked her a question he'd been wondering about for a very long time.\"Let me ask you something\u2026\"Nod-\"Do you think the Heavens and the Abyss can live in harmony?\"'I'm already doing that.'That was the first thought that crossed Ain's mind.Since Hyun was currently \u00abAssimilated\u00bb into her, they were, in a sense, harmonizing.But she couldn't tell him the details of \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, so after thinking about it for a while, she answered in another way.\"It doesn't matter if you're part of the Abyss. Although it isn't common\u2026 Many users collaborate and play with other users that belong to the opposing force.\"Although at first glance it may sound like an answer that didn't tell much, that was enough to surprise Radiette.He also thought similarly, nut back then, even mentioning that was a sin by itself.\"On the other hand, there are people from the same force who fight against each other.\"The Heavens were the absolute good, and the Abyss was the target they had to eliminate.This was how Radiette thought long ago, and he had never questioned it.It was the Archangel who had designated the Abyss as evil, and there wasn't any human or Heavenly Being that could go against the will of a Transcendent.But users thought differently.An Angel was just another NPC.The oracle's messages weren't different from those from an event.The habitants of Asrian couldn't easily understand the users\u2019 way of thinking.But the one NPC who thought similarly to users was Radiette.\"Does that mean that the Abyss is fundamentally different from evil?\"\"There are bad people everywhere; it's the same for the Heavens. And there are many good people that belong to the Abyss, too.\"At Radiette's repeating question, Ain answered immediately.She didn't even need to think about it.The Knight Ain had killed during her job ascension quest was someone that was being hunted for being a killer.There wasn't something like absolute good or absolute evil.'He's suddenly asking weird things.'Ain tilted her head after hearing the questions.After she'd revealed herself as a Heavenly Being, Ain wasn't answering as Hyun had told her\u2014she just spoke her honest thoughts.But that ended up moving Radiette.Radiette, known for always remaining calm, couldn't even hide his tremble.\"I see\u2026 So this is how a user thinks.\"After thinking for a while, nodding, it seemed like he'd understood something.\"There are a few more things that I want to ask you. It may take some time\u2026 Is that okay with you?\"\u300cHyun, is it okay?\u300d\u300cYes, it doesn't matter.\u300dAs Ain nodded, Radiette activated a magic.As a light covered them, they were teleported to somewhere.\u2014It was a resting place on top of the Giant's Forest.Radiette's house was hanging on the branches of a tree just as if it were a bird cage.It was a shabby home for an existence like a Heavenly Being to live in. However, it was a quiet and cozy place.Radiette and Ain talked about quite serious topics there.He asked various questions, and from a certain point, Hyun began answering them.\"After listening to your stories, I wish I could experience your world\u2026 It seems like a world that has been blessed,\" Radiette mumbled while smiling.A Heavenly Being was someone who belonged to the sky.In general, they didn't harmonize with humans, and neither of them listened to the other's opinion.The reason why Radiette was able to talk about his honest opinions was that Ain resembled his ex-lover, and that made his mental barrier crumble.From a certain point, the conversation moved away from topics related to the Heavens and the Abyss.\"Are you still wondering about the strength of a Heavenly Being?\"\"No, I'm okay.\"\"Fu, users really do as they want.\"The topic of the conversation changed constantly.He also asked her how she was able to get the Rune of a Heavenly Being.There was no reason to lie, so Hyun just told him the truth.This Heavenly Being, probably someone rare, had a way of thinking that was very similar to a user's.'Is it about time?'While talking, Hyun tried to get the conversation to a certain topic.Two hours had passed when Radiette finally asked Hyun the question he wanted.\"Is there any place you want to visit?\"\"I want to go to Iluna,\" Hyun quickly answered.At that moment, Radiette's expression darkened.\"For what reason?\"To tell the truth, he wanted to go there because of Louise's quest, but he thought that it was better not to mention that.\"I\u2026 Just want to visit it.\"\"It's better if you don't go there right now.\"\"Why?\"Radiette thought silently for a while but then began explaining.\"Do you know that Iluna can't be seen\u2026? The reason for that is because the sun can\u2019t reach it.\"The reason why Earth's Moon shone was that it reflected the sunlight.On the other hand, Iluna couldn't be seen, even at night.\"However, Iluna's outline began appearing a few days ago, which means that the orbit of the eclipse is off. This is proof that an unexpected event is about to happen on Iluna.\"\"Unexpected?\"Although Hyun was bad at science, he understood what Radiette wanted to say.Iluna's Unexpected Event\u2026When Hyun heard those words, he remembered something about Asra's history.According to the history of the previous game, Iluna was usually a quiet and peaceful place.But because of an incident, that peaceful land had become hell.'Don't tell me\u2026 Is it that event?'At the same time, a certain face came to Hyun's mind.'Louise\u2026!'If by \u201cUnexpected Event\u201d, he was referring to that\u2026 Iluna would soon become a dangerous place.Since they were the words of a Heavenly Being, he couldn't just dismiss them.Hyun's heart started to beat faster.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She just happened to be similar to the person in his memories.It had been hundreds of years since that day, so the wounds of that day had faded.But he had flinched the moment he\u2019d seen her.That meant that there was still a lingering feeling left in his mind.Maybe it was his last chance to get rid of that remorse that was lingering in his mind?After a while, Radiette answered.\"I'll go with you\u2026 I stayed in this forest for too long.\"The moment he was able to get the help of the Heavenly Being Radiette, Hyun celebrated inside.* * *[Laillai is about to take off! Flight duration is three hours!]Fwoosh-While honking the horns, the shuttle rose into the sky.It was the sign of the shuttle departing from the gate located in the capital of the Holy Kingdom.Because of the high price of the ticket, at the moment, there wasn't any user that could board it.\u2014Except for a very few wallet warriors.\"Mr. Radiette, it's an honor meeting you.\"\"Bless you.\"Radiette was very popular among NPCs.The other Heavenly Beings were also almost equally popular, but Radiette was more famous because of his past achievements.For a while, he had committed sinful actions, but the story of him locking himself away from the rest of society to think about his mistake was a famous story, even in the Heavens.It had been 10 years since the last time a Heavenly Being had visited the Holy Kingdom, so Radiette received lots of attention.Ain, who was next to a Heavenly Being, also received lots of attention.The good thing was that, thanks to Radiette, they had been assigned to first class.A few NPCs were mumbling among them while looking at Ain.If Ain hadn't changed her hairstyle and clothes, the NPCs that belonged to the Heavens would've probably recognized her.Not only was she a Grand Master in PvP, but she had twice cleared a quest from the Knight Commander\u2014she had gained some reputation thanks to that.To be more precise, it had been Hyun and TarrTarr who had cleared the second one, but since the Knight Commander thought of them as one party with Ain, her name had also spread.\"Since she's with a Heavenly Being, she's also probably one.\"But despite her fame, the NPCs weren't able to recognize her.Although it really didn't matter since Ain was distracted, looking at the virtual space.\"How long are you planning to stay in Iluna?\"Suddenly, Radiette asked him a question.Hyun, who was also looking at the window, answered him.\"If my business goes fast, one day; if not, maybe a week?\"\"One week is too long.\"\"Why?\"\"Iluna getting clearer means it's moving further away from its normal orbit. It will soon be lit up by the sun,\" Radiette said while referencing Heaven's sacred books.In the sacred books, it was written that Iluna would turn into hell the moment light reached it.Once Iluna was covered by fire, it would end up being devoured by the Abyss.But rather than the topics related to the Abyss, Hyun focused on another thing:The sun\u2026The reason why Louise was staying on Iluna was probably because she was under a curse that made it so her location would become known to her enemies if the sunlight touched her.But what if the eclipse disappeared?Iluna wouldn't be a safe place for her anymore.\"Since when did Iluna's orbit start to change...?\"\"It hasn't been long... But the speed is increasing each day. In about four days, it will be completely off, and that's why I'm saying that one week is too long.\"While Hyun was starting to feel uneasy, Radiette continued the explanation.\"There\u2019s a record of something similar happening thousands of years ago. It took 500 years before the orbit normalized.\"Hyun could feel his lips getting drier after listening to Radiette's explanation.He never thought that there would be a time limit to the quest of searching for Louise.Not only that, but he didn't have much time.What if he hadn't received the Evil's Seed Dungeon from the Knight Commander?What if he hadn't been able to get a clue from the Abyss Repository?If there had been a delay in any sector... Everything would've ended before he was able to meet Louise again.'No, should I be glad I got to know it now?'Hyun breathed slowly.Hyun's eyes slowly sank. He was thinking of a way to find Louise as fast as possible once they reached Iluna.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Iluna\u2026The moon, which had a radius about half the size of earth\u2019s moon, didn't have night or day.Phantom Land\u2026\u2014It was the name people from Asra used to refer to Iluna.There weren't many people who knew about the existence of Iluna, even among users.But there was someone who had just become the first user to arrive at Iluna.The number one ranking player in the Hall of Fame!It was Lattice.'It's hard getting used to this place's weather.'Because it wasn't reached by light, the temperature was always below 0.Although some Magic Circles could control temperature, it required too much Magic Power to heat such a large mass of land.Because Lattice didn't have the title of Heavenly Being, he felt the cold just as it was.<Quest: Demon Djonial's Test>- Destroy the 7 Magic Circles that exist on Iluna! (Amount Destroyed: 4)If it weren't for a quest, he wouldn't be staying in such a frozen land.A user who had received the quest of a demon\u2026The reason why Lattice had been able to reach the place was thanks to his reputation, which had increased thanks to his ranking in the hall of fame and winning the Duke's Tournament.'A low-ranking demon, huh.'Lattice, thanks to his own information network, had learned about the information of the most relevant NPCs.He remembered the names of the known Transcendents especially well, so the moment he read the name of the demon, he knew its identity.'Well, I guess this is my limit for now.'Up until then, Lattice had successfully completed missions step by step.Everything had always been easy for him.He had skills, luck, money, and lots of other things, so failure wasn't even an option for him.The reason why he was able to reach his current position was his perfectionist nature.He had always succeeded because he had planned everything carefully so that he wouldn't fail.Whap-!The moment Lattice put the demonic crystal in, the energy of the Abyss started to spread through the Magic Circle.Even if everything was going according to his plan, Lattice wasn't smiling.To be able to talk about perfection, he was missing something.Subconsciously, Lattice murmured a name.\"Come, Hyun.\"He murmured that ID out of nowhere.While investigating information related to Asra Online, there was a name that he read everywhere.His accomplishments were so amazing that it was hard to tell if they were truth or rumor.\u2014That's why Lattice was especially impressed by them.He didn't know where he was at the moment or what he was doing\u2026But if he were playing Asrian and had the goal of reaching the top, they would meet one day.Was Hyun someone that was a match for himself?As another Magic Circle of Iluna was immersed in darkness, Lattice's eyes also sank into the fading light.* * *[We're about to enter Iluna's atmosphere!]Paf-The shuttle shot a huge beam of light.After receiving the beam of light, Iluna began showing itself.\"Oh, my...\"Radiette frowned after looking at the sight of Iluna through the window.\"There isn't a lot of light left... What happened?\"On Iluna, there were seven magical circles where there were columns of light that rose to the sky.The magic circles controlled the orbit and also worked as lighthouses, but right then, there were only two left.\"It seems like the situation is far worse than I thought.\"All the other Heavens NPCs couldn't hide their surprise after seeing what was happening.Only a few Holy Knights that knew what was going on were able to remain calm.It was at that moment\u2026The incident began without any warning.\"Kyaa!\"Suddenly, a scream spread through the shuttle.Everyone's gaze turned to where the scream was coming from.There, one of the flight attendants was morphing.\"Back off!\"Radiette pulled in Ain.He was looking with gleaming blue eyes at the girl whose figure was transforming.\"What's happening?! An accident?!\"\"Is that person okay?\"With everyone looking, the flight attendant's skin began turning dark.Then, horns and a tail appeared on her body.Finally, wings that seemed to contain a pitch-black darkness spread.A violent energy began swirling from her black wings.That figure belonged to someone who represented the Abyss.\"Oh...!\"The Priests, who were the first ones to feel the presence of the Abyss, put their hands together.They began naming all the Angels while trembling.\"No...\"\"How could something like this happen...!\"The figure of the flight attendant had fully morphed into that of a demon.Not only her face, but her aura had changed as well.Fwoosh-!The flames of hell spreading from her feet began melting the shuttle.Hyun uttered in surprise.He knew the name of the demon who had just appeared.The owner of the sharp wings was\u2026'Keidrial\u2026?!'One of the three highest-ranking demons that belonged to the Abyss.The Great Demon of Deception had suddenly shown herself.Her appearance had a huge effect on the shuttle.Not only were the normal NPCs frozen, but even Knights and Magicians with high levels had pale faces and couldn't move.Except for Hyun, Ain, and Radiette, it was probably their first time seeing a demon.Demons hadn't made an appearance for hundreds of years, so they were like an existence from myth or legends!\"Ugh...!\"Just making eye contact made someone faint.To people who belonged to the Heavens, a demon was synonymous with death.They were frozen because of fear.'Don't tell me... Is she Deception?'Among NPCs, only Radiette was calm. However, he was also dripping cold sweat... He could remain calmer than the rest because he was a Heavenly Being.\"Don't panic. The demon probably won't be able to do anything here...!\"Radiette shouted toward the rest.A Transcendent was an existence on par with a god.They had enough strength to change the flow of the world, but they could only intervene indirectly.Just by appearing there, she had probably used a lot of her strength.\"A Heavenly Being? You're a clever kid.\"After finishing her transformation, she looked around while smiling.\"That's true. I have no intention of harming you. I came here today to see the face of someone.\"Most couldn't look at the joyful expression of the Great Demon.Except for two\u2026\"Hmm...\"Suddenly\u2026Keidrial's gaze fixed on Ain and didn't leave her for a while.It was as if she was looking through her soul; then she mumbled.\"There's two today as well.\"Hyun felt his heart sink.Keidrial, who was a Transcendent, could see through the soul.He was sure she'd seen him \u00abAssimilated\u00bb to Ain.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 - The Land of Eclipse Dyed by the Abyss (1)'Does she remember me\u2026?'Hyun and Keidrial had already met each other before.While picking a job, he had called 'Deception' by her real name, and because of that, he'd seen her true self.Hyun remained silent because there was nothing good to be gained by recalling that incident.Thankfully, Radiette intervened.\"Return.\"\"\u2026\"\"I know you can't use your strength.\"If a Transcendent wanted to go against the law of cause and effect, they had to pay a price equal to it.By looking at the fire burning around her, it was clear that she was burning a huge amount of her ego.She wasn't planning to take a huge penalty just for killing some humans there.Radiette knew it, so that's why he was able to remain calm.She had made an impressive appearance, but that was it.\"I can't use my strength?\"The Demon of Deception made a creepy smile after listening to Radiette's words.\"What if I can\u2026?\"Then, she slowly lifted her claws.Radiette frowned.If a Transcendent intervened in the world without obtaining Empathy through prayer or a ceremony, it lost a lot of oneself.Just making a little bit of influence was enough to lose strength equivalent to hundreds of years.It was fatal damage.There was no way that a greedy Demon would make such a choice, but one never knew, so Radiette was nervous.\"Fufu, you're right. I have no intention of wasting my ego.\"While everyone was holding their breath, she turned her eyes toward Ain.Hyun took a deep breath while feeling chills at the same time.He felt that she was analyzing his soul.\"It would've been great if I had more time, too bad\u2026\"After saying that, just as suddenly as she\u2019d appeared, she vanished.As the Demon disappeared, the flight attendant's body returned to normal.Only then could they relax after feeling a choking pressure.But the dangerous situation wasn't over just because the Demon had disappeared.\"We're in trouble!\"The Great Demon had left a huge mark just by appearing.The fire and dark energy she\u2019d poured out had melted the shuttle.Everyone's faces turned pale as a portion of the shuttle got cut out, and the scenery outside became visible.The probably was that no human could survive if thrown into space.Bzzt-!Before a difference in pressure occurred, Raidette created an ice shield and covered the hole.\"Is a crash landing possible?\"\"I\u2026 I'll do my best!\"The good thing is that it had happened when they'd almost reached Iluna.Whish-As they entered Iluna's atmosphere, the wind hit, and shook the shuttle.\"The cracks are getting worse\u2026\" Radiette gritted his teeth and murmured.Those who understood the meaning became either pale or serious.\"The strong ones protect the weak.\"Crash-!The moment Radiette said that, the shuttle fell apart in midair.The destroyed pieces of the shuttle began falling, attracted by the gravity force of Iluna.'Damn\u2026 What is this!'Hyun and Ain were swept away by Iluna's air currents.Not only was it not reached by the sunlight, but there was also a blizzard in the sky, so they couldn't see anything.\u00abWind Barrier\u00bb.Hyun created a foothold in the sky and regained his balance.Judging from the situation before the crash, they were probably thousands, or maybe tens of thousands, of feet above the surface.If they were swept away by the air, they could end up dying, so it was important to slow down their speed.\u300cAin, please find Radiette!\u300d\u300cI also can't see anything!\u300d\u300cUse your flames.\u300d\u300cUgh\u2026 Okay!\u300dAin activated \u00abEfreet's Claws\u00bb in both hands.She thought that if she waved a pair of flames in the middle of the darkness, Radiette would be able to find them for sure.'I can't see him.'Ain waved her hands for a while, but there weren't even any traces of Radiette.The powerful winds of the blizzard hit their ears with force strong enough to cover the entire world.The moment they\u2019d been swept away by the wind, everyone scattered away, so there was a chance that the distance between them had increased.\u300cIs it too late to find him?\u300dThe winds that covered Iluna's atmosphere were more than ten times faster than those of a typhoon.If they were swept by it even once, they would end up dragged away by it.Hyun looked at the ground.He thought that, once they were on the ground, they'd be able to meet Radiette.While letting his body drift through the wind, the current of air entered a downward stream.Hyun and Ain passed through a translucent membrane.Paf-!At that moment, the snow blizzard suddenly stopped.The wind also calmed down.Iluna became silent as if it had become static.After passing through the barrier, the flow of the atmosphere completely changed.Status Quo Barrier\u2026* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The enormous magic circle that enveloped the satellite had been created by a Transcendent in the past.The main job of the barrier was to maintain an atmosphere similar to the one in Asra on Iluna.Thanks to that, even though the sun didn't reach inside the barrier, there was always a brightness similar to a sunset.There weren\u2019t any strong wind currents, it didn't snow frequently, and the gravity was similar to Asra\u2019s.Hyun felt that their speed of descent had increased since they\u2019d gone through the barrier.It was as if they were skydiving. But with Ain's Agility, he probably didn\u2019t have to worry about receiving damage from falling.\u300cIt seems like we've gotten quite far away.\u300dHyun first tried to see their location.After they entered the barrier, the view had gotten clear.He could see remnants of the shuttle falling on the horizon with smoke trailing from it.It seemed like they'd been swept away in a completely separate direction from the rest because of the strong wind currents.Radiette was probably near the place where the shuttle had fallen.\u300cHyun, look down!\u300d Ain suddenly shouted.\u300cLook at the people that are beneath us!\u300dJust like she'd said, Hyun found a group of people on the ground.They were all looking up.Were they the people who had fallen before them?He thought that for a little while but soon discovered he was wrong.'Ugh\u2026! \u00abWind Barrier\u00bb!'Hyun quickly created a wall in the air and stepped on it right before a giant flame brush passed them.Someone under them had cast a magic aimed at them.\u300cWho are they\u2026?\u300dHyun's eyes were filled with nervousness.They\u2019d almost gotten hit with a strong magic because he\u2019d been lost in his thoughts.After coming back to his senses, he looked down.\u300cWho are they? Why are they attacking us?\u300d\u300cHmm, aren't they part of the Abyss?\u300d Ain mumbled.They got a clearer view of the people as they got closer to the ground.They were wearing robes of Magician NPCs that belonged to the Abyss.\u2014They were the opponents he always used to face while playing Asra.\u300cIf the Abyss is here\u2026 It seems like the unexpected event is really happening.\u300d\u300cDefinitely. This doesn't seem normal.\u300dIluna's Unexpected Event\u2026The fact that they were there, in a territory that belonged to the Heavens, was proof that something weird was going on.After feeling the hostility coming from them, Hyun murmured.\u300cIt seems like we'll have to fight.\u300d\u300cShould I use the Ultimate Attack?\u300d\u300cNo, save it.\u300dSeveral projectiles came flying in their direction, but Hyun used the \u00abWind Barrier\u00bb to step on and dodge the incoming attacks.Boom!Ain\u2019s body soon hit the ground as if she were a meteorite.[Fall! You've received 5271 damage!]Hyun quickly looked around. He soon realized their level based on their appearance.He'd faced many NPCs that belonged to the Abyss, so he could correctly guess their levels just by looking at their clothes.\u300cThey're all around level 200!\u300dGrrr-!A giant bear with claws sharp as a demon rushed in their direction.It seemed like there was either a Summoner or a Hunter among the opponents.A bear was a tank summon with high HP\u2026For most people, it was a troublesome opponent to face, but for Hyun and Ain, it was easy prey.Fwoosh-!Two claws made of fire appeared on Ain\u2019s hands.'Amplification buffs!'The moment Hyun activated the skills, two auras of different colors spread.\u00abPowerless Wave\u00bb, \u00abImpact Amplification\u00bb.Ain, powered with both buffs, used her claws to attack the bear.Both of their claws were targeting each other!But Ain's claws were bigger than the bear's.The bear screamed in pain after receiving many attacks because of the difference in the reach.[You've received 1049 damage!][You've received 1102 damage!][You've received 749 damage!]Because there were lots of attacks coming from the sides, Ain was also receiving damage, but it wasn't enough to influence the result of the fight.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 46039 damage!]After all, the amount of damage Ain received was less than the HP she recovered!\u300cCan you resist?\u300d\u300cI'm not going to die with just this!\u300dThe HP that appeared on Ain's interface was varying quickly.The moment she received damage, it was immediately filled.As Hyun and Ain's new skills combined, their damage output couldn't be compared to the past.After learning the situation they were in, the opponents stopped attacking for a while\u2014And then they centered all their attacks on one point.Lots of magic, arrows, and weapons began pouring to one point.After looking at the numerous projectiles flying toward them, Ain's voice became urgent.\u300cHyun, I can't resist this!\u300d\u300cIt's okay, leave it to me.\u300d\u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb, \u00abShield\u00bb.Hyun activated both skills and turned the claws 360 degrees.Ting-!He brushed off some of the attacks with the claws, and the rest were absorbed with his skill.Ain didn't receive any damage at all.On top of that, there was the effect of \u00abShield\u00bb.Half of the opponents were stunned.As a gap of three seconds appeared\u2026\u300cAin, now!\u300d\u300cNow?!\u300dBoom-!Ain used the \u00abLatent Potential Increase\u00bb.Hyun used \u00abInvisible\u00bb and \u00abBiorhythm Acceleration\u00bb at the same time.Fwoosh-!Invisible flames spread.Ain targeted a Magician that was in the back row.\"Coff\u2026!\"Because a strong shield surrounded the Magician, he didn't die even after receiving multiple attacks from Ain.Paf-After feeling his life was at risk, he used a teleport scroll to escape.Tsk- Ain clicked her tongue.The reason was because killing a high-level human opponent NPC gave a lot of experience.\u300cDon't overdo yourself!\u300dEven after \u00abInvisible\u00bb and \u00abBiorhythm Acceleration\u00bb's effects had ended, Ain tried to charge toward the opponents. Hyun used control priority to stop her.\u300cLook around. More enemies are coming in our direction.\u300d\u300cHmm\u2026 Yeah, that's right.\u300dThe opponents that were five had multiplied by seven\u2026 No, eight.As time went on, the number of enemies increased.Ain suddenly murmured.\u300cWas this a land of the Abyss\u2026? Where are all of our allies?\u300d\u300cThe current state of Iluna is weird! Let's go over there for now!\u300dHyun and Ain started to run toward where the shuttle had fallen.But that place was plain.Because there weren't any obstacles, it was a place that benefitted the pursuers.Ain's steps were constantly delayed because of the relentless attacks from the enemies.\u300cBe careful\u2026!\u300dSmash-!A metal thorn of three meters rose in front of Ain.If Hyun hadn't quickly slowed down, that thing would've penetrated them.\u00abMetal Edge\u00bb\u2026That thing that rose from the ground had the effect of stunning, so it was a close call.'Isn't it easy\u2026?'After taking a glance behind, Hyun saw another Magician flying toward them who had almost finished casting.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 - The Land of Eclipse Dyed by the Abyss (2)Whap-!The moment the opponent pointed the wand toward them, Hyun felt his body start to become sticky.[You couldn't resist!][Your speed is decreased by 25% for 100 seconds!]The enemy\u2019s formation was very well thought out.\u2014Especially the Magician's chained attacks.Fwoosh-!As one of the opposing Priest's waved his arms, red energy suffused the rest of the enemies.\u00abBlood Gallop\u00bb.It was a skill that increased an ally's speed.Even Hyun was starting to feel a sense of danger.The prey was getting slower, and the pursuers faster, so the likely outcome was obvious.'Ugh, \u00abWind Barrier\u00bb!'Hyun created a foothold in the air and stepped on it.He was thinking of jumping into the air, up to a point where attacks couldn't reach him... But as soon as he tried to do that, his plan was foiled.Swish-!Thousands of thin thorns flew toward the sky.The damage each one dealt was low, but it was enough to destroy the \u00abWind Barrier\u00bb.As soon as a foothold appeared, it was destroyed.The enemies weren't dumb.Even in Asra Online, some humanoid NPCs were as intelligent as a real person.They could easily counter a skill they'd seen previously, especially if they were trained.'I can't escape through the air...?'Hyun gulped while falling down.It seemed like the opponent's formation was optimized for pursuing.Hyun made a decision.Rather than dying while escaping, it was better to face the enemies.\u300cAin, this can't continue like this.\u300d\u300cShould we fight?\u300d\u300cYes!\u300dFwoosh-!As soon as Hyun answered, Ain used \u00abEfreet's Claws\u00bb.But the bear summon that had served as a source of HP wasn't there anymore.The enemies had learned how the \u00abVitality Absorption\u00bb skill worked.If they were average users, they would've probably felt that there was no way out of it.Hyun and Ain were nervous but not desperate.They'd gotten through numerous dangerous situations like that one in Asra Online.Crash-!Ain activated one more \u00abLatent Potential Increase\u00bb.That time, she raised her Agility.The blood-red aura surrounding Ain got more intense, but her HP dropped to less than 10% in exchange.Was it a suicide attack?No, Hyun quickly understood Ain's intentions.\u300cLeave it to me. I'll move.\u300dThey didn't need to talk to know each other's thoughts.If one began moving first, the other one naturally did their best to support.It was the result of playing as a pair for a very long time.Fwoosh-!\u00abSteps of the Incarnate\u00bb.A skill that instantly closed a gap of up to 30 meters.A road of fire was drawn across the plains.In a flash, Ain was in the middle of the enemy formation.A smile was drawn on Hyun's mouth.\u300cGood, now!\u300dHyun put as many enemies as possible within the attack's range.The reason why charging with \u00abSteps of the Incarnate\u00bb and swiping the enemies away with the claws looked like one movement was because Hyun and Ain's timing coincided perfectly.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 46293 damage!][You've dealt 22293 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 45293 damage!]A flaming tornado appeared in the middle of the enemy's formation.Every time Hyun spun the claws, countless system messages appeared.While leaving the movements to Hyun, Ain concentrated on using the skills.She used \u00abLatent Potential Increase\u00bb each time her HP reached the maximum amount.Surprisingly, that timing, rather than seconds, was in the milliseconds.In an instant, two more \u00abLatent Potential Increase\u00bbs overlapped.Even after that, her HP was full.'One more.'Crash-!Ain once again used the \u00abLatent Potential Increase\u00bb while backing off and attacking.The last one was Agility.On top of the ones she'd already used, her \u00abLatent Potential Increase\u00bb had overlapped five times, and the energy coming out from her had turned into a bloody dark-red color.\"\u2026\"The enemies started to get worried.They'd noticed the change in Ain's atmosphere.Unlike users, humanoid NPCs only had one life.The hurt ones moved to the back and received healing from their partners; then the ones whose HP had dropped to less than half left the battle.Despite all that, the number of enemies didn't decrease\u2014the battlefield was constantly refilled with new opponents.'There's no end.'* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Hyun was overwhelmed by the endless attacks from the enemies.The only good thing was that Ain had previously completed her job ascension.If it weren't for that, her Mana would've already plummeted.Whir-.At that moment, the enemies that were in the back had finished casting.Hyun felt an unpleasant sensation spreading through his body.[You couldn't resist!][Dark Spirits started to devour your soul!][You'll receive 109 damage every second for 60 seconds.][You couldn't resist!][You've been exposed to a weakening curse!][For 120 seconds, the amount of damage you receive increases by 15%!]The most bothersome things were curses or debuffing skills.The resistance to debuff depends on your level, skill, or an item's effect.For someone like Ain, whose level was lower than the opponents, that was something critical.But the scariest thing was that they had more than one type of debuff skill.Goooo-The moment one raised the wand and pointed to the sky, menacing black energy started to gather around him.Hyun knew what skill it was just by the effect around it.\u00abChains of Darkness\u00bb.It was a skill that locked your feet and blocked you from moving for about five seconds.Before the dark energy finished gathering, Hyun shouted.\u300cStop that spell no matter what!\u300dAin reacted immediately.As the flames cut the darkness, the dark energy scattered away.Although the casting was interrupted, the dangerous situation wasn't over yet.Because Ain had forced the movement, she had no other way but to throw her body into the middle of the enemies.The moment her weakness was exposed, numerous skills came flying toward her.\u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb, \u00abVision Sword\u00bb!'Hyun quickly summoned a big sword of light.A blue light cut the air.Because the \u00abVision Sword\u00bb's attack range was bigger than \u00abEfreet's Claws\u00bb, it successfully hit numerous opponents.Ain's HP, which had been near the bottom, quickly replenished.\u300cHyun, are those ready?\u300d\u300cWhat? \u00abInvisible\u00bb and \u00abAcceleration\u00bb?\u300d\u300cYes!\u300dAt Ain's urgent voice, Hyun gave a realistic answer.\u2014Although it wasn't the one she was hoping to hear.\u300cEven if I use that, it will be hard to get away since this is a plain.\u300d\u300cUgh, is that so...?\u300dThe terrain's characteristics put Hyun and Ain in a dangerous situation.\u00abInvisible\u00bb and \u00abAcceleration\u00bb lasted for two to three seconds.There wasn't a place where they could hide.Even if they could gain some distance, they would probably be caught up to quickly.'Although we still have the Ultimate Attack left.'Hyun thought of the last resort.The best way to shake off the enemies was to push them away with an overwhelming attack.Wasn't there any other option?It was when Hyun was thinking about a solution\u2026\u300cHyun, someone is approaching us!\u300dHyun turned his head around at Ain's shouting.Someone was approaching them at an amazing speed from the far end of the plains.He was moving so fast that it seemed like the flow of the air bent.\u300cAnother enemy?\u300d\u300cNo, it's different...!\u300dIn the blink of an eye, it came from the end of the horizon to near them.Bzzt-!One of the enemy's vanguards froze instantly.The ice statue soon turned into white dust and scattered away.After one enemy died, Hyun finally discovered the identity of the new person who had appeared.\"Radiette...!\"Just as Hyun had guessed, he had landed where the shuttle had fallen.But Hyun was surprised because of another reason.\u2014He was a Heavenly Being, yet he was frowning as if he were in pain.Judging by how he was grabbing his chest, it seemed like he had been hurt somewhere.Because a Heavenly Being, an overwhelming existence, had appeared, the enemies escaped.Radiette didn't pursue them.No, he probably didn't have the luxury to do that.\u2014He was breathing heavily.\"Oof... Don't go over there.\"Radiette stopped her as Ain was about to go to the gate at the main magic circle.\"There are too many opponents over there. You won't be able to get in.\"\"Even for a Heavenly Being...?\"\"Yes. Do you understand how dangerous Iluna is at the moment?\"Who could put the life of a Heavenly Being in danger?Hyun tried to think of a few opponents, including demons.If an existence like that was on Iluna, that probably meant that the Unexpected Event was about to happen.\"We're in danger here, too. If only there were somewhere where we could rest\u2026\"\"There's a village to the west.\"\"Really?\"After seeing Radiette's reaction, Hyun discovered something.\u2014Radiette knew less about Iluna than he did.In one way, it was obvious.After being kicked out from the Heavens, he hadn't left the Giant's Forest even once.\"It seems like you know more than me. Is this also because you're a user?\"\"Well, that's true in a sense, but...\"\"Then lead the way.\"Ain and Radiette began moving in the direction Hyun had indicated.\"Too slow.\"Radiette spoke and then grabbed Ain's body.Although he had been injured, it seemed like he didn't feel burdened by Ain's body.As Radiette began properly running, they crossed through the plains as fast as the wind.They reached their destination after ten minutes.They thought something was wrong after looking at the remnants of the buildings.\"There's no trace of life...\"The senses of a Heavenly Being were way above those of a normal human being, so what Radiette said was true.Ain and Radiette walked through the town that had turned into ruins.\u300cHyun, was this also done by the Abyss?\u300d\u300cProbably.\u300dAll of the destruction caused in the village was probably done by monsters.If monsters were already freely roaming around, how much had the unexpected event progressed?\u300cThere are only two controlling magic circles left.\u300dAfter realizing that, Hyun's face darkened.There were originally seven magic circles that controlled Iluna, and they were placed at the center of a giant hexagon.Each magic circle shot a beam of light up into the sky, thus becoming visible from both the sky and the ground.There were only two light beams left\u2026\"There aren't any bodies. Except for the buildings that have been wrecked, there aren't any signs of a battle,\" Radiette said while looking around.\"There's a possibility that people left the town before the disaster happened. Judging by how the snow has covered the footsteps, it seems like it has been quite some time... There doesn't seem to be any casualties.\"Then Radiette pointed in a direction with his finger.It was one of the places where one of the magic circles that controlled Iluna was located.\"Let's go over there.\"\"It's a little bit far away, is that okay...?\"\"Yes, there's no problem.\"The moment they decided on their next destination, Radiette grabbed Ain and began running.Because time had passed, Radiette had recovered a lot of his HP. Thanks to that, his breathing had normalized.The speed at which he ran was faster than what Hyun thought, so it took him less than an hour to reach the destination.\"There are definitely lots of people around here.\"A Heavenly Being\u2019s senses not only allowed him to notice the presence of people, but also to guess the number of people very precisely.Hyun looked at the walls of the city.There were clearly people inside, but they still didn't know what force they belonged to, so they had to be careful.\u300cI hope the Abyss hasn't taken this place.\u300d\u300cNo, it's of the Heavens!\u300dAin said after finding someone wearing a blue Priest robe.After taking a closer look, there were Knights and Soldiers wearing the armor of the Heaven's forces.\u300cIt seems like this place is still okay.\u300dYes. How this city looks was probably how the rest of Iluna used to look, too.They hadn't seen any Heaven\u2019s NPCs after reaching Iluna, so their presence was very welcome.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 - Priestess (1)\"Are you... A Heavenly Being?\"The guard was looking sharply at the two figures approaching. When he realized Radiette's identity, he changed his posture to a more cordial one.Because both Radiette and Ain had the runes of a Heavenly Being, it didn't take them long to prove which side they were on\"It isn't good\u2026\"Radiette frowned while looking around.That was the only city on Iluna that had a temple.Usually, it was a comfortable and relaxing place, but at the moment, it was full of anxiety and fear.\"Ah...!\"Everyone turned their heads around after hearing someone groan.That place beyond the horizon was where one of the two remaining magic circles was.The light beam that was rising to the sky suddenly disappeared.The sight of the magic circle becoming powerless could be seen from all over the city.\"The light turned off\u2026\"\"That means that it's our turn next?\"\"We don't have much time! Monsters are soon going to attack the city!\"The city was filled with panic and nervousness as the light pillar disappeared.The people of the city had realized that they were the Abyss\u2019s last target.Hyun, Ain, and Radiette also saw that.\"This is the only remaining place.\"Radiette couldn't hide a bittersweet expression.Hyun had a similar expression on his face.While playing Asra, he hadn't felt it, but there, everyone around him felt real, so he felt as if he was assimilating their feelings.What made Hyun come back to his senses was a quest notification that\u2019d suddenly appeared.Ting-![<Quest: Iluna's Crisis>]- 6 of the 7 magic circles have been destroyed! If the last one is destroyed, this will no longer be a territory of the Heavens.- But it isn't over yet. The Priests who felt Iluna's crisis are trying to summon an angel.- Go with the Heavenly Being to the Heavens\u2019 Altar! The Priests will thank those that arrive to help!<Reward>- The Priest NPCs will completely trust you.- You'll be recognized by a Heavenly Being and a Transcendent.Hyun's eyes widened after reading the quest description.\u2014It was because of a certain part of the quest details.'Angel summon...?'* * *The preparations were over.The army was also fully prepared.There was only one place left\u2026They were about to start the last step when the demon received an order it couldn't refuse.\"The law of cause and effect is balancing. Wait until I order you.\"It was an order from Keidrial, the Great Demon of Deception.She only said that and didn't give any more details.After thinking about it for a while, the demon started to laugh.That's right. Even if there were a delay, the result would be the same.Everything would end up going as they planned, so there was no need to hurry.* * *'Is this the end?'That new quest he'd received was one of the easiest since he\u2019d started playing Asrian.The quest would be over after he took Radiette to the temple at the city's center.\"It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Radiette.\"The Priests greeted Ain and Radiette.\"But the person with you\u2026\"Just because she was with a Heavenly Being, Ain received a lot of attention.\"If someone asks you, just say you're a Heavenly Being. That will save us time.\"\"Can I do that?\"\"It isn't a lie, right?\"When she thought about it, that was true. From then on, whenever an NPC asked who she was, Ain said she was a Heavenly Being.Radiette nodded.The moment they learned about Ain's identity, the NPCs were moved.\"Two Heavenly Beings visiting the temple simultaneously!\"\"Could we please know your name?\"\"I'm Ain.\"Ain ended up saying her ID.\"Ain\u2026? I think I heard about\u2026 Oh!\"It was a coincidence that an NPC knew about that name at Iluna's temple.He was one of the Priests that the Holy Kingdom had sent.It seemed like he'd heard about Hyun and Ain's achievements for the Empire.\"An Empire user...\"\"What you're thinking is probably right.\"* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cI see. I heard that there was a user who was recognized by a Heavenly Being\u2026 But I never thought that you'd continue the bloodline! It's an honor to meet you!\"\"Huh\u2026?\"It seemed like the Priest had misunderstood something, but since Ain didn't correct him, the topic flowed into the next.The Priests treated her as if she were noble.The fact that Ain was a user had already been revealed, but no one treated her less because of it.It was obvious if you considered the weight that the words \u201cHeavenly Being\u201d had in the Heavens.\"Now we have three Heavenly Beings here. It feels like the fog of darkness is slowly being lifted!\"The topic completely changed after an old Priest said something.\"Wait, three? Is there someone else?\" Radiette asked back in surprise.\"You didn't know? The Heavenly Being Mrs. Maria is also staying here.\"\"Maria... Is here?\"Radiette's eyes narrowed.\u2014It was because an unexpected name had come out of the Priest's mouth.\"I'm going to meet her right now.\"\"Let me guide you.\"The Priest bowed. There wasn't an NPC of the Heavens that could refuse a Heavenly Being's request.Radiette looked at Ain.\"I'll go alone. Is that okay?\"\"I don't mind.\"As Ain nodded, Radiette followed the Priest through the corridor.Ain was left alone.The Priests wanted to talk to the new Heavenly Being, but they couldn't get themselves to do it because it looked like Ain didn't like talking.Ain was talking with Hyun through whispers.\u300cHyun, didn't you say that you have a quest to complete on Iluna? We came here because of that.\u300d\u300cThat's right, Ain. Now is the perfect opportunity.\u300d\u300cOpportunity?\u300d\u300cLet's sneak into the temple.\u300d\u300cHuh...? So suddenly?\u300dAin seemed confused by Hyun's sudden words.\u300cI just got a hunch. It seems like I'll be able to find her here.\u300d\u300cWho?\u300d\u300cHmm\u2026 It\u2019d take a long time to explain. I'm going to do it now, so rest for the moment.\u300dThey were lacking time if he wanted to explain to her everything related to Louise from start to finish.Before Ain could say anything, Hyun used two skills.\u00abInvisible\u00bb! \u00abAcceleration\u00bb!The moment the skills were activated, Ain, who was calmly sitting on the sofa, disappeared.\"She vanished...!\"\"Where did she go?\"\"She probably had something to do. We don't need to worry about her.\"The Priests were surprised after Ain suddenly disappeared, but that was all.Since they recognized Ain as a Heavenly Being, they thought there was probably a good reason behind her actions.That's how Hyun could easily reach a place deep within the temple.\u300cHyun, do you know where we're going?\u300d\u300cNo, it's my first time here\u2026 But I think I know.\u300dIluna's only temple wasn't small, even compared to the main temple of the Holy Kingdom.It was big and luxurious.It was as if the majesty of the Royal Palace had fused with the church's holiness.The statues and chandeliers that decorated the hallways were made with transparent crystals.One could tell the financial power of the Holy Kingdom by looking at how they wasted money on expensive crystals.'It should be around here\u2026 There are no more possible places\u2026!'Hyun wandered around the insides of the temple.Thanks to \u00abInvisible\u00bb and \u00abAcceleration\u00bb, Hyun could go through places that were forbidden to even high-ranking Priests.They\u2019d probably let a Heavenly Being in... But Hyun chose to sneak in just in case.Ten minutes had passed.Hyun and Ain reached a place where there wasn't anyone around.\u300cIt's quite dark around here. It looks like an old museum.\u300d\u300cJudging by the fact that there isn't any dust, it isn't an abandoned place.\u300d\u300cFufu... Maybe there's a secret passageway? There's always something incredible around these kinds of places!\u300dBoth of them walked through the empty place.At first, Ain was looking to see what Hyun would do, but now, she was having fun.It was because the memories of both of them wandering through unknown places came to her mind.The dark temple had a mysterious and charming atmosphere.'If it's now\u2026 It should be okay, right?'Ain suddenly fell into relaxing thoughts.'It's going to be okay, right?'Ain was about to take action when suddenly\u2026Paf-!Suddenly, flames erupted and spread light through the darkness.Hyun and Ain looked at the place where flames had appeared.They saw a girl who was about the same size as Ain standing in an awkward position there.She had a small flame in the palms of her hands.\"Ah\u2026!\"Paf-!The unknown girl mumbled some words and quickly smothered the fire in her hands.They could only hear the girl\u2019s voice in the place that had darkened again.\"D-did you see...?\"\"What?\" Ain asked while tilting her head.\"My\u2026 Magic. Flame is, in reality, an element of the Abyss. However, I can use it by mere coincidence. I'm not of the Abyss, but the Heavens...\"\"What?\"Ain, who still couldn't understand, shrugged her shoulders.\"I don't care. I'm also part of the Heavens and can use flames.\"After replying that, Ain tried to ignite a fire in her hands.Crack-!But instead of that, \u00abEfreet's Claws\u00bb came from her hands.She had forgotten that, because Hyun was using \u00abAssimilation\u00bb on her, the skill level had increased and thus evolved.\"Oh, this isn't it.\"\"H-hic\u2026!\"\"Oh?\"The girl started to walk backward after looking at Ain's hands, which had become similar to a monster's.Surprised, Ain tried to approach her, but that only made the girl collapse.\"Oh, is it because of these\u2026?\"After discovering that the reason behind her reaction was \u00abEfreet's Claws\u00bb, Ain asked Hyun.\u300cHyun, \u00abDisassimilate\u00bb for a little while. I was trying to show her another thing\u2026 But this weird thing ended up coming out.\u300dBut from the moment Hyun saw the girl, he couldn't properly hear Ain's words.Was it her?At first, he had some doubts since her height and face were different from his memories.But after looking at her reaction, he was sure of it.The face she made while frightened hadn't changed at all.'I've found her.'He was sure of it. The girl in front of him was Louise.In those five years, she had grown a lot. She was at the same height as Ain.When they\u2019d first met, she was around 10-years-old, so considering that she was 15, the growth rate was understandable.\"Louise? You're Louise, right?\" Hyun asked her using Ain's voice.But that only made her even more scared.\"N-No... I don't know a person by that name. If you want to kill her, that's another person!\"\"What are you talking about? It's obvious you're Louise.\"Hyun finally laughed.He thought it might be fun to tease Louise a little bit more but decided to stop.It wasn't appropriate to play a joke at a reunion.To calm Louise down, Hyun took off Ain's gloves and showed her the rune.\"Y-you're a Heavenly Being!\"Then, finally, Louise wiped her tears and stood up.\"Ugh\u2026 I thought an enemy had infiltrated\u2026 I'm glad you weren't.\"\"Louise.\"\"Yes, I'm Priestess Louise.\"'Priestess?'Although an unexpected word came out of Louise's mouth, Hyun started to wonder if she remembered him.But Hyun was part of the Abyss. He didn't know what would happen if he \u00abDisassimilated\u00bb while in the territory of the Heavens.Radiette was someone very sensitive, so if he became suspicious of them, the situation could worsen.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 - Priestess (2)Because he couldn't temporarily \u00abDisassimilate\u00bb, Hyun decided to show Louise another thing.Whoosh-Hyun used \u00abOne Second Absorption\u00bb on Louise's body.As a blue light rolled over her body, Louise became surprised and moved her shoulders.\"This Magic...!\"Louise remembered it.\"This... I miss it a lot! You're the second person I\u2019ve who can use it!\"\"No, I'm probably the first one. Who else would use a skill like this\u2026?\"\"What does that mean?\"\"Louise, haven't you realized it yet?\"Hyun took out a paper he'd saved in his inventory.Although it was a letter Louise had left for him years ago, it had been only a month since he'd read it.The moment Louise realized what the paper was, her eyes began shaking.\"This...\"Louise suddenly asked with a louder voice.Hyun felt expectant while looking at Louise's shaking eyes.\"Do... you know someone named Hyun?\"\"I'm Hyun...\"Frustrated, Hyun told Louise the truth, but it seemed like she was having a hard time understanding it.Hyun took out The Blood Fairy's Cape, The Ring of the Executioner, and the bag with gold Louise had left for him.\u2014It was all the stuff Louise had left in the secret marketplace.\"Oh... Those are...!\"\"Have you finally realized it's me?\"Louise had finally understood the situation.The person who had used that scary fire skill in front of her was Hyun, the one she'd been thinking about.He had really come.Louise couldn't believe it.\"Hyun, are you really Hyun...? Why did you suddenly turn into a girl? Is this also one of the abilities of the so-called users...?\"Oof...Hyun grabbed his head at the words of the still innocent Louise. He activated a skill.\u00abAssimilation\u00bb.The moment he used it, Hyun's soul went from Ain's body to Louise\u2019s.Louise had previously accepted for Hyun to use his skill on her, and it seemed like he still had control priority.Both souls began talking inside Louise\u2019s body.\u300cNow, do you believe me?\u300d\"Yes, it was this feeling...!\"\u300cI'm sorry, I can't show myself here for a few reasons.\u300dIt was Hyun's voice as Louise remembered it.\"It's really you...!\"She could also feel that it was like she couldn\u2019t move her own body.The reason was that the control priority of \u00abAssimilation\u00bb still hadn't been canceled.The first moment she'd experienced it, she was scared. She thought that maybe a demon had taken control of her body. But she had missed even that unnatural feeling.\"Hyun... You really came.\"Tears started to flow from Louise's eyes and drip down her chin.Melancholy? Happiness? Or maybe another type of feeling...? She also couldn't understand why she was crying.\"I never thought you'd be able to find this place...\"That skill shared the target\u2019s body state.Without realizing the weird gaze Ain was giving at him, Hyun had been infected a little bit with Louise's feelings.\u2014That's why it took more time than expected.\u2014That's why Ain had to remain still while Hyun was \u00abAssimilated\u00bb into a girl she'd never seen.* * *While Hyun and Ain were moving through the temple's interior, Radiette met with Maria.\"So it was really you.\"Just like Radiette, Maria was a Heavenly Being famous among people.She looked like the definition of someone noble and holy\u2014she was probably the closest one to the people's image of a Heavenly Being.According to rumors, her personality was as benevolent as her appearance.If Radiette had distanced himself from the world, Maria was a Heavenly Being who was very interested in it.\"I never thought you'd be on Iluna.\"Maria smiled at Radiette's mumbles.\"I can be anywhere. Since there are people everywhere.\"While they\u2019d still been in Heavens, Radiette and Maria were what you would call friends.Obviously, their relationship had never evolved into anything else.Radiette had a person he loved, and Maria didn't know how to love only one person.The reason why these two with opposing personalities became friends was probably that they were interested in how the other one lived.Because of their opposing opinions, there had been times when they\u2019d discussed an entire day away.\"Even after hundreds of years, you're still the same. Are you here to help the humans?\"Maria nodded while smiling.Radiette laughed at her simple answer.\"It must be comfortable being you. You're so consistent that you probably don't need to think a lot.\"\"Oh, but I also think lots of different things.\"\"You still don't know how to take a joke.\"Their past selves would've probably spent hours talking about lots of non-important things.But right then, they didn't have the luxury of doing that.It was Radiette who spoke first.\"This battle, the Heavens won't be able to win it.\"\"Why is that?\"\"It's simple. The difference in power is too overwhelming.\"Radiette still remembered the sight he'd seen from Iluna\u2019s atmosphere.\u2014The army of the Abyss was waiting with their mouths opened for the sky to fall on the gate.When he thought about it, it was good that the demon had suddenly forced them to crash-land the shuttle.If it weren't that, everyone there would've died as soon as they landed on Iluna at the hands of the Abyss's army.\"Except for this city, they've taken control of everything... Even if there are two Heavenly Beings, the result will probably be the same.\"\"It isn't just Heavenly Beings.\"\"What?\"\"What if there was an Angel...? Wouldn't the situation turn 180 degrees?\"\"Is that true?\"Radiette had a serious expression on his face.Summoning an Angel wasn't something you could do at any time.\"I can't believe it.\"For an Angel to be involved, one of two things had to happen.\u2014The first one was Ego.For an overwhelming existence like a God to appear, that entity had to consume part of its Ego.But that option wasn't very effective.The damage the Great Demon of Deception could exercise was damaging the shuttle.The second one was Empathy.It was getting Empathy through \u00abPray\u00bb.Usually, you needed a lot more Empathy to summon a high-ranking Angel.\"Isn't the number of Priests too low for summoning an Angel?\"Radiette pinpointed the problem very precisely.To summon a low-ranking Angel, they would probably need thousands of high-ranking Priests. But there, there were only about a hundred of them.With only that much Empathy, there was no way they'd be able to summon an Angel.\"The Priests aren't going to \u00abPray\u00bb,\" Maria said while smiling.\"We have a Priestess.\"\"A Priestess...?\"\"Yes, the Priestess will \u00abPray\u00bb. If the rest support her, we should be able to summon an Angel.\"Not every \u00abPrayer\u00bb was the same.The \u00abPray\u00bb of a Priest who had prayed for his entire life was worth a hundred times that of a normal person. Then, the \u00abPray\u00bb of a high-ranking Priest was worth more than a thousand times.Also, there were some people who'd received the love of Transcendents from the moment they were born.\u2014Those were the ones called Priestesses.Was it that their voice immediately reached the ears of Transcendents?There had been cases throughout history of Priestesses who'd been able to summon angels by themselves.Of course, the abilities of the Priestesses that had appeared throughout history differed greatly.\"How skillful is the Priestess?\"Maria thought a little bit before answering Radiette's question.\"I'm not sure. After I brought her here, I've never seen her praying.\"\"A Priestess that doesn't \u00abPray\u00bb? That means you don't know her capabilities!\"\"No, I do know that. After she started to live here, she received three oracles. Isn't that amazing? She didn't even \u00abPray\u00bb but received an oracle.\"\"What the...\"\"I'm not sure, but I think her abilities are close to those of a Saintess.\"\"A Saintess?!\"\"I'm glad I brought that kid to the Heavens. What would've happened if that kid fell into the Abyss's hands?\"Radiette was still suspicious.There had been only one recorded case of a Saintess throughout history.If what Maria said was true, that meant all his worries had been for nothing.With the presence of just the Saintess, the course of the battle could change.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *[You've cleared the quest 'In Search of Louise!'][You've canceled the main event, 'The Darkness Buried in the Sky'!][You've gained 20 skill points!][Your tendency is getting closer to a deeper Abyss. (Current: -91)]Hyun received quite a lot of message notifications, but he decided to think about the details later on.Hyun talked with Louise through the soul while Ain was looking on silently.Although it had been just a couple of weeks for him, it had been more than five years for her.Louise's conversation was getting longer.\"Fufu, that's how I reached this temple. And at the same time, I received a job.\"\u300cPriestess?\u300d\"That's right. Isn't it cool? Even I have something I can do right.\"Hyun knew what a Priestess was.There was no way he wouldn't know about the people who had a big role in battles throughout history.But he had a hard time believing Louise's words.\u300cWeren't you an Angel?\u300dHyun remembered the footage he'd seen of Louise at the end of the Evil's Seed Dungeon.In that video, he\u2019d seen Louise losing her wings and being dyed by the Abyss.As Hyun told her that, she tilted her head.\"Me, an Angel...? Hyun, what kind of nonsense are you talking about...?\"It didn't matter how much he explained to her. It seemed like Louise didn't understand.At that moment, Hyun remembered something, and then he changed the question a little bit.\u300cLouise... Do you remember your childhood?\u300d\"Childhood\u2026 What ages are you referring to?\"\u300cBetween seven and eight.\u300d\"There probably isn't anyone who remembers something that happened at such ages. Right?\"\u300cDoesn't everyone remember that...? How old are you?\u300d\"Fifteen... I don't remember things that happened more than eight years ago.\"After talking with her, Hyun learned something.\u2014Louise didn't remember her childhood.She thought it was normal that one didn't remember incidents that happened when they were eight.'There's something\u2026'He began feeling a headache.Had someone done something to hide Louise's past?Or maybe she'd lost her memories after suffering an accident.That would probably explain why she didn't remember her childhood and why she'd forgotten that she was an Angel.'I think she used to be an Angel.'Hyun decided to think of Louise as an Angel for the moment.\u2014An Angel who had lost her childhood memories.Usually, Angels didn't \u00abPray\u00bb because doing so went against their own ego.But what if one lost their memories?Shouldn't an Angel that had forgotten its identity be able to \u00abPray\u00bb?Also, even if she'd lost her memories, her Empathy as a Transcendent probably couldn't be compared to a human's.That meant that the effect of her \u00abPray\u00bb probably couldn't be compared to a normal human's.This was probably why Louise thought she was a Priestess.'Although there are some loose ends... I guess this makes sense for now.'Hyun made a provisional judgment.Louise was an Angel who had lost her memories.While \u00abAssimilated\u00bb, Hyun opened Louise's status window.After seeing the details, he smiled bitterly.Louise (Lv. 100)HP: 3000/3000Mana: 3240/3240Job: (???)[Strength: 2(+3)] [Agility: 21(+9)] [Vitality: 24(+6)] [Magical Power: 190(+137)][\u00abSteps of the Wind\u00bb Lv.4(+1)] - <+Open>[\u00abSlight Fever\u00bb Lv.1(+1)] - <+Open>____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 - Priestess (3)'I think I'll need to give up on my plan of her recognizing me.'The condition for the job ascension was to be fully recognized by an NPC stronger than him.Also, the quest said that the stronger the NPC, the better the power he would awaken.According to the status window, Louise didn't fulfill the conditions for his job ascension.But if one asked if Louise was a strong NPC, he would have to shake his head.Had she lost her strength while she was an Angel after losing her memories?Anyway, he couldn't leave the job ascension quest to Louise.'Should I visit the Knight Commander again? Or maybe, should I tell Radiette about the \u00abAssimilation\u00bb skill and then somehow try to convince him? The remaining experience will be accumulated, so it really doesn't matter if I push back the job ascension.'\"Hyun...\"Ain, who had remained silent for a while, called out to Hyun, who was immersed in his thoughts.\"Hyun.\"\u300cHyun?\u300dHyun returned to his senses after Ain called him in numerous ways.\u300cYes? Did you call me?\u300d\u300cCome back to me, quickly.\u300dAfter listening to her words, he \u00abAssimilated\u00bb to Ain.As soon as Hyun came back, Ain asked him a question.\u300cDo... You want to hang out?\u300d\u300cEh?\u300d\u300cNow that I think about it, I've never seen you personally.\u300d\u300cWait, are you asking to meet me in real life? Not the game?\u300dInstead of answering, Ain nodded.Meeting Ain in a place that wasn't Asrian\u2026Before being surprised, Hyun began wondering about Ain's intentions.She had previously said some random things in the past... But it was the first time she had said something like that.\u300cWhy so suddenly?\u300d\u300cEhmm... Uhmm... Because.\u300dHyun's doubts started to morph into anxiousness.Ain always murmured like that before doing something he had never imagined.\u300cI just want to?\u300d\u300cYou just want to...?\u300d\u300cAre you busy?\u300d\u300cWell, I do have free time...\u300dHyun felt a little bit awkward.He had no reason to refuse Ain's request.He still felt a little bit weird meeting people he knew from video games in real life, but since he'd always hung out with her anyway, it should probably be okay.Yes, meeting her in real life at least once should be okay. Hyun made that decision.\u300cIf we're going to meet, let's make it that day\u2026 Soon, Asrian's announcement festival is going to be held.\u300dA few days ago, a piece of news was uploaded to the official page.NFM was going to organize an Asrian Festival.Rumors said that developers were going to announce something huge that day.Because it was Asrian's first offline event, many people were planning to travel to Korea.\u300cI also have time that day.\u300dAs a date was arranged, Ain started to play with her hair.When the conversation seemed to have ended, Ain said something more.\"Hyun, I'm asking this just in case. Except for me and him... Tarr Tarr, have you used \u00abAssimilation\u00bb with any other user?\"\"N-no...?\"\"Leaving NPCs aside, a female user is\u2014\"\"I won't do it!\"Hyun quickly answered before Ain could finish her sentence.Even the dull Hyun understood the reason behind the topic.'Hmm... This?'Hyun had started to feel it more frequently... But was Ain interested in him?It was a thought he had in the corner of his mind.At first, he thought it was his imagination, but as time went on, he started to become sure of that after looking at her actions.Hyun could feel his heart beating fast, but because of \u00abAssimilation\u00bb, he wasn't sure whose reaction it was.While being \u00abAssimilated\u00bb to Ain, that feeling didn't disappear for a while.* * *After it was decided that they'd summon an Angel with the Priestess\u2019s Praying, the two Heavenly Beings started planning their strategy.Radiette first gave his honest opinion.\"Even if we summon an Angel, it must be a Bishop\u2026 Or at least higher than Plain ranking.\"Asra users called the categories elite, high, middle, and low, but the correct way of calling Angel's rankings was the one mentioned above.Radiette said they had to summon a middle-ranked Angel at minimum.\"If we summon a Servant or one with a lower ranking... \"Even the lowest-ranking Angel was stronger than a Heavenly Being, but they weren't strong enough to change the flow of the battle.They could end up losing, even if they managed to summon an Angel.\"We'll have to trust our Priestess.\"\"Oof, there's no other way. Huh?\"They only had one chance to summon an Angel.Even if she were a Saintess, she probably wouldn't have enough mental strength to summon more than one Angel.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafy* * *Click-The door opened when the two Heavenly Beings were deep into their thoughts.There was a mixture of surprise and happiness in the Priest\u2019s face who had just entered.\"Mrs. Maria, we just got an oracle!\"\"An oracle...? Now?\"\"Yes! It seems like the Angels are protecting us!\"\"Was there a Priest who prayed?\"\"No, this time came without any warning. Just like before!\"Radiette and Maria quickly went to the altar.It seemed like the situation was over. The light had already died down.The content of the oracle was drawn as light in the air.The two Heavenly Beings, and a few high-ranking priests, could decipher the content.As Maria read the oracle, the Priests shouted in happiness.\"Oh...! An Angel has promised us victory!\"\"I'm glad. I'm really glad...\"The oracles didn't lie.If an oracle said that the Heavens would win, that was what would happen. It was like reading the history of the future.Everyone who had panicked after seeing Iluna's light turning off shouted in happiness.The oracle ignited hope.\"An oracle...\"Radiette was suspicious about it.While everyone was happy, only he wasn't feeling comfortable.He went through the content of the oracle many times and then asked a question.\"Do oracles come in such a direct way these days? The oracles I know are very confusing and make their interpretation hard.\"\"Oh, yeah. That's right. They used to be like that.\"A high-ranking Priest answered Radiette's mumble.\"But recently, the Oracles we receive are quite simple. Haha, thanks to that, interpreting them has gotten easier.\"Maria nodded and added an explanation.\"That's right, Radiette. After we brought in the Priestess, the oracles got clearer.\"\"Is it the Priestess again...?\"\"Yes. I believe this is one of the abilities of the Priestess.\"Even Radiette had no choice but to give in.If they really didn't need to interpret the oracle, did that mean that they could just follow the Angel's instruction?Radiette started to wonder about the limits of the Priestess Maria they had brought in.\"It seems like all our worries have been magically solved.\"The two Priestesses read the contents of the oracle more carefully.Judging by the content of the oracle, it seemed like the forces of the Abyss were going to start moving by midnight the next day.If they knew the exact time at which the battle would start, they would be able to prepare for many things.And there was one more piece of information they were able to get\u2026\"The 'Iluna's Center' mentioned in the oracle is the center of the hexagram. Right?\"\"Yes, it probably refers to the main magic circle.\"Thousands of years ago, the Abyss had once invaded Iluna.There was a record that said that, back then, they were able to summon an Angel at the magic circle located in the center.According to the sacred texts, after the Angel appeared, tens of thousands of monsters were cut in half. The Heavens ended up winning in just an instant.Maybe that historical scene would repeat.\"This is going to be easy.\"After reading the oracle completely, Radiette laughed.The Priestess should take one Heavenly Being and Pray.\u2014That condition was easy to fulfill.The Abyss army was probably getting ready to invade the last city. So there was a huge chance that the main magic circle would be empty.He'd be able to take the Priestess there safely for sure.\"I'm going to be okay alone.\"\"No, you can't go there.\"\"Why?\"Maria shook her head.\"You must protect this city. If the light turns off, there's no meaning in summoning an Angel.\"\"What are you talking about, Maria? You can stay here and protect the city.\"At Radiette's question, Maria made a sad smile and showed him the back of her hand.The rune of the Heavenly Being shining faintly.\"Maria, you...\"A Heavenly Being was an existence that was between a human and the Angels.Whenever they influenced the world, their life was cut short.The reason was that their ego was cut short each time they intervened in the world.Maria had always looked at humans.Maria's life span being shorter than Radiette's was, in a sense, expected.After noticing the decision in her eyes, he sighed.\"It seems like you recently did something.\"\"I have no regrets. I was able to meet the Priestess and bring her here. And then, there's you, who will replace me for sure.\"\"No... Once this is done, I'll return to the forest.\"\"But that won't be today.\"Maria laughed while saying that.Radiette wasn't sad about Maria dying.If she wished it to be so, she should\u2019ve been able to live for another 500 years at the minimum.She had chosen to die, so he had no reason to be sad because of that decision.'Then, there's going to be only one Heavenly Being with the Priestess...?'Radiette read the oracle and swallowed a bitter smile.The oracle contained the will of an Angel, but he couldn't help but think that they were being swayed by it.* * *After they parted ways with Louise\u2026Hyun and Ain returned to the place where they had originally been.\u300c...\u300dThere was an awkward silence between them.After the previous conversation, the atmosphere around them had gotten weird.Even Ain, who usually told embarrassing jokes, was silent.Hyun, who felt uncomfortable with the silence, mumbled for himself.\u300cHmm... Should I send the footage of the fights on Iluna to TarrTarr...? He has probably already finished editing, so it should be okay if I send them to him.\u300dWhile Hyun was earning time, Radiette appeared.Next to him was a woman who, judging by her appearance, was clearly a Heavenly Being.\"So you're that user.\"Maria smiled kindly while looking at Ain.\"I have a gift for you. Will you follow me?\"- Her gift is for you, for herself, and for the Heavens.Hyun and Ain got the same message at the same time.After reading the content of the quest, Hyun realized something and, with a serious expression, nodded.After a while, they entered an empty room.\u2014It was a big, white, empty place.Maria, who finally stopped her steps, opened her mouth.With a serious expression on her face, she began talking.\"There was something I wanted to ask you. In a sense, the gift is just the hook.\"\"A favor?\"\"Did I hurt your feelings?\"\"Not really.\"After answering, Hyun looked at Maria's expression.He wondered why she'd suddenly called Ain, but he decided to leave that doubt behind for the moment.Instead, he thought about the word that appeared in the quest. Legacy.What was she thinking at the moment?There was no way he'd know.Maria's expression hadn't changed. She had the same gentle smile.\"You're free to refuse, but I hope you don\u2019t.\"[The Heavenly Being 'Maria' wants to teach you a skill!][Will you accept?

    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 -\u00a0 The Road that Leads (1)\"Okay.\"As Ain answered, Maria's face brightened.Maria soon extended her hands to the sky.Spark-\u00a0A transparent sword appeared in her hand with a flash.\"Look closely.\"Maria pointed the sword forward.Vzzt- Vzzt-\u00a0The sound of lightning kept getting louder.As the amount of electricity increased, Hyun felt the sword was getting heavier.And the moment the transparent sword was completely covered by lightning\u2026Slam-!Maria's sword flashed from side to side.And with that, lightning shook the place.The electricity gathered in the sword was all discharged at once, leaving a burning mark on the ground.[You've witnessed the swordsmanship of a Heavenly Being!][Because you lack understanding of swords, you cannot learn this skill just by looking!][Because you have the title 'Heavenly Being,' the progression rate has gone up a lot!][Progress: 50%]'This\u2026'Hyun's mouth fell open after looking at Maria's sword.It wasn't because of its power.\u2014It was because he knew what that skill was.\"Did you see?\"Hyun nodded.\"How much did you understand?\"\"About half.\"\"Well done. If you're a Heavenly Being, it shouldn't take you long to learn it. Although it may be hard to master it completely.\"After Maria finished talking, she shook her hands. Then the sword scattered away into the air and disappeared.\"To be honest, I also haven't completely mastered this sword technique. I won't be able to since... This was created by a Transcendent.\"'I guess so.'\"But if it's a user whose growth potential is endless... Maybe, one day, you'll be able to do it.\"Maria grabbed Ain's hands from behind.Paf- She passed the transparent sword to Ain.It meant that she, a Heavenly Being, would teach a skill to a user.\"Lightning hides its destructive power in silence. It's more destructive and scarier if the opponent can't easily move.\"[You've received the teachings of a Heavenly Being!][The progress rate increases even faster!]Suddenly, a scarecrow appeared in front of them.Following Maria's hand gesture, Ain began hitting the scarecrow.Slam-!

Instead of hitting numerous times, do it just once.\"[You've received the teachings of a Heavenly Being!][The progress rate increases even faster!]\u300cHyun, isn't this...

You always wanted to use a sword.\u300d\u300cThat's true\u2026 But I wonder how much I'll be able to perfect this as a Support.\u300d\"Lock the power of lightning in the air.

But Hyun, who was used to that kind of thing, kept learning without taking a break.Hyun was so moved by Maria's teachings that he decided that, if Maria asked him for something, he'd try his best to fulfill it.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafy* * *While Hyun and Ain were learning from Maria\u2026All countries that belonged to the Heavens were starting to get nervous.\u2014All because of Iluna!Before the shuttle of the Holy Kingdom crashed, all countries that had sided with the Heavens had a sentiment that something was about to happen there.Among those countries, the Holy Kingdom was especially worried.\"How could something like this...\"The hands of the Archbishop of the Holy Kingdom shook while looking at Iluna as it became visible.Iluna was a place where Empathy resonated more easily than in Asra.The main magic circle was like a sacred place for the Holy Kingdom.The reason was that praying there made making contact with a Transcendent easier.Officially, that was a neutral place for all the Heavens\u2019 countries, but in reality, it was under the control of the Holy Kingdom.The Holy Kingdom's specialty was Holy Magic, so losing Iluna wasn't too different from losing their capital city.\"Is that day about to repeat...?!\"Thousands of years ago, the Abyss had tried to invade the sky.In the past, they'd barely been able to defend Iluna thanks to numerous sacrifices.But now... If that day repeated, how would things end?The Unexpected Event in Iluna was a hot issue among all other Heavens countries.Because NPCs talked about Iluna the entire day, that news also got into the users\u2019 ears.The rumors among NPCs spread through the community boards via specialized game sites.There was no way users, who were searching day and night for information about quests, would miss that news.\u300cWhere's Iluna? Is it a moon?\u300d\u300cThey say it's a place that's good for Priest-related jobs to grow. You can find more information in the main post.\u300d\u300cIt seems like we won't be able to go there anyway. Doesn't that mean that it shouldn't matter to us?\u300dA moon\u2026Many users didn't know you could reach such a place inside the game.While users were starting to get disappointed after learning that going to Iluna was hard, the biggest event in Asrian's history was generated.All Heaven's users who had completed the job ascension received the same message.[Heaven's Alliance Quest: Iluna Support]- The Pope says to the users: Iluna is currently in danger!- Iluna isn't just a simple moon, it's a sacred place where lots of holy energies gather! We cannot lose it to the Abyss's forces!- More than half, no, most of you will probably die. However, since you're free from death, would it be okay if I asked for your help?- Around midnight, the Holy Kingdom will create a 'Warp Portal' that connects to Iluna. The names of those who join the fight will be recorded in the main temple forever.[\u203b Only users over level 100 who have completed job ascension can join.]: Will be distributed based on personal merit - <+Open>Iluna\u2019s Quest\u2026The quest generated by the Holy Kingdom was called like that among users.The reason why there wasn't a lot of excitement despite the level requisite being high was that the reward wasn't that impressive.According to the calculations someone made, you had to be among the top 25% to make a profit for participating in the quest.\u300cIsn't this a trap quest?\u300d\u300cThe rewards are kind of lackluster... Well, it isn't like I can participate or anything, so it really doesn't concern me.\u300dAt that moment, about 1500 users from Heaven had completed the job ascension.That meant that half of the users who fulfilled the pre-requisites were rankers.People thought that rankers weren't going to participate because of fear of wasting time.\u2014But the result was the opposite.'Streaming material!''Just being among the top 10% will be enough. Magician-related jobs are very active in wars, so this is perfect for me!''If my name is put on the walls of the main temple, my reputation will go up. Right?'Although users only saw the rewards in front of them, rankers analyzed the quest from many points of view, and most of them concluded that it was better to participate.Their decision had a huge effect.People related to gaming shows were busy trying to scout rankers who were going to participate.Korea's biggest gaming channel, 'The Gamez,' also tried to schedule the broadcast.On a few channels, regular shows were pushed off by specials related to Iluna.It was the same on the community boards.As time went on, conversations related to Iluna increased.\u300cNews! Lattice is on Iluna right now!\u300d\u300cWhat? Wasn't Lattice an Abyss user?\u300d\u300cThere really seems to be something happening on Iluna!\u300dFrom a certain point, all community boards about Asrian worldwide became full of threads related to Iluna.People were more excited than when the Count's Quest happened, since the scale of the event was even bigger!It was enough to grab the attention of users who were tired of hunting or doing quests.As things were getting hotter, a peaking event happened.One video shook all of the communities worldwide.The one who had uploaded a video with that short title was Tarr Tarr!Tarr Tarr had quickly edited the footage Hyun had sent to him.Also, instead of using the channel TarrTarr, he created a new one called AIN.The reason why he decided to upload the video as soon as possible, and the reason why he created a new channel, was that Tarr Tarr's sense of judgment had gotten better.The video began zooming out from the moment Ain started to fall from Iluna's sky.As soon as she landed, the fight against the forces of the Abyss began.Users who clicked on the video couldn't close their mouths for a while\u2014they were surprised by the amazing production and how skillful Ain was.Ain's video quickly started to spread through the rest of the communities.\u300cWoah, she also started YouTube. I'm sure she's going to earn lots of money, lol.\u300d\u300cAin and Lattice are on Iluna? How did they get there?\u300dThe fight between Ain and the forces of the Abyss gave people lots of things to analyze.The opponent's skills or strategies were at a level users hadn't yet experienced.Ain's ability to fight at a close range was as surprising as always.Many people tried to guess Ain's specs by looking at the effects of her skills.\u300cWhat skill is that? Is that also one of the Dark Priest's skills?\u300d\u300cI can't imagine what level the enemies are.\u300dBecause Tarr Tarr had hidden some parts of the interface, many numbers didn't appear.Users had to guess the level of the enemies through Ain's previous data.\u300cThe opponent seemed to be between level 100 to 150. Ain's fire probably deals at least ten thousand damage.\u300d\u300cIs doing ten thousand damage at around level 100 even possible? It's not like she's using an Ultimate Attack.\u300d\u300cWhat? That doesn't seem to be a skill of a Dark Priest.\u300dA few users with good eyes looked suspiciously at the unknown skill's effects.Although they weren't able to guess precisely\u2026They had felt it before, but looking at Ain's footage while fighting made their blood boil.Most users watched the video from start to finish as if they'd been possessed.The sense of reality that created the illusion that they were part of the fight made their hearts beat faster.What everyone felt after looking at the video was the same:'Was Ain always this good...?'She'd gotten famous thanks to PvP.But most users thought that she lacked a little bit compared to Lattice.\u2014The reason was that PvP and real battles were different.But after watching Ain fighting in a real battle, everyone's opinions started to shake.'We don't know who'll win if they fight against each other!'There was a piece of interesting information going around in the communities.\u2014Both of them were on Iluna at the moment.On top of that, Ain belonged to the Heavens,\u00a0 and Lattice was part of the Abyss's Forces.Everyone couldn't help but think of a certain possibility\u2026'Could both of them end up fighting against each other?'Of course, that would happen only if they ended up encountering each other, but only the thought of that battle taking place made them excited.Users were waiting for the Asrian-related programs that would start at around midnight with high hopes.\u2014Hopes that the fight they were imagining would happen.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 -\u00a0 The Road that Leads (2)[Proficiency rate has maxed out, the skill level is increasing!]After a while, Hyun lay down on the floor, feeling satisfied.'Finished...'Ain ended up laying on the floor in a weird position, but she didn't mention anything to Hyun since she was also tired.Increasing that last level took them a while.As a skill\u2019s level increased, raising the proficiency rate became harder, and the level they\u2019d just raised it to took them about five hours of non-stop training.\u2014Even with the help of the Heavenly Being Maria.[\u00abAngel's Basic Sword Art\u00bb Lv.5]- If you do not attack for 8 seconds, this attack will deal 210% of the damage.[\u203b The level of this skill increases with proficiency rather than points!]Because Ain used the rest mode frequently, she couldn't learn as much as Hyun.That resulted in Hyun and Ain reaching levels 5 and 4, respectively.They couldn't do anything about her low skill level.There had been times when she\u2019d stayed in rest mode for too long and ended up being forcibly logged out.If he had suddenly been forced to disassimilate and had been left alone with a Heavenly Being as a member of the Abyss, things could've gotten ugly.'Because they\u2019re the same skill, they can't be overlapped.'Hyun started to analyze the new skill.Judging by how the skill wasn't active on Ain's status window, it seemed that, while \u00abAssimilation\u00bb was active, only the skill with the highest level appeared.'I guess it would be too OP if they could be overlapped.'A damage increase that could be activated once every eight seconds\u2026Although the effect didn't seem like much, that was because its skill level was still low.Hyun knew from first-hand experience in the previous game how strong the skill could become if it evolved.Not only that, but the current effect wasn't bad either, so Hyun was satisfied.\"Good news.\"After Ain and Maria exited the room, Radiette's face had become slightly brighter.\"The Holy Kingdom is about to open a Warp Portal that leads to Iluna.\"'Warp?'\"Warp Portal? But...\"Hyun had doubts, and Maria had a vague expression on her face.\u2014It was because she knew the main problem of a warp portal.\"How many will come through...?\"The warp portal didn't last long.The Holy Kingdom most probably didn't have the power to open a warp portal two consecutive times.If the Heavens lost, that would mean that everyone who had crossed through the portal would die.Were the Empire and the Holy Kingdom sending their soldiers to die?Even if they sent reinforcements, they couldn't expect their strongest knights or magicians to reinforce Iluna.Radiette extended his explanation.\"It seems like the Pope used his head. He's going to send users to Iluna. If it's them, they probably won't be afraid of death.\"\"Oh\u2026\"\u300cHyun, is the Pope's quest referring to this?\u300dAin shared her quest window with Hyun.It was Iluna's Quest, which had become a hot topic among users on the community boards.\u300cWhat, when did you receive something like this?\u300d\u300cWhile learning the sword technique.\u300d\u300cCan you share it with me?\u300d\u300cFufu, do you want it? Sadly, I can't, because you're part of the Abyss.\u300dAin's quest window showed the remaining time until the quest started.Hyun felt a little bit bittersweet that he'd been left out of the quest because he was part of the Abyss.Ain noticed Hyun's mood and smiled.\u300cHyun\u2026 Is it because you didn't receive the quest?\u300d\u300cHmm? No\u2026?\u300d\u300cThe rewards of the quest are mostly gold and items. I can share them with you.\u300d\u300cWhat? Y\u2026 You will?\u300dHyun asked back in surprise.Ain replied while playing with her hair.\u300cWe've shared the same body for a while. And\u2026 Hyun, you're sharing half of the profits generated from the videos with me.\u300dAfter hearing Ain saying something unexpectedly wholesome, Hyun smiled.'Well, I guess it's normal?'If it weren't for him, she probably wouldn't have thought about going to Iluna and would be spending her time dueling.If the reward was given out depending on merit, he thought he also had a right to claim some of it.Of course, that was Hyun trying to justify himself.Radiette\u2019s voice calmed down the excited Hyun.\"According to the oracle, the Heavenly Being and Priestess must \u00abPray\u00bb at the same time at the main magic circle.\"According to the oracle\u2026Radiette said it with a serious voice while looking at Ain.By how Radiette bit his lips, Hyun understood Radiette's feelings, who was struggling to talk.\"I'm sorry\u2026 But could I leave it to you?\"\"Me?\"\"Yes. There isn't anyone else.\"Hyun looked at Maria.He understood after seeing Maria nod with a sad expression on her face.It was what Maria had wanted to ask them.To be honest, Hyun had no reason to accept the proposal.It would be Maria's fault if he didn't fulfill the promise since she had given out the reward before the quest ended.\"I'll do it.\"Hyun didn't refuse.Before he knew it, he was treating Maria as a real human being instead of an NPC.Hyun wasn't cold enough to refuse a desperate favor.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Four people in total were going to the main magic circle.First, there was Ain (Hyun) and Louise.And with them, there were two Priests.The Priest had the job of helping with the Priestess's ceremony.\"I'm counting on you\u2026\"Louise made an awkward smile.Ain also smiled awkwardly.It was the first time they'd officially met.\"It's an honor to be able to take part in such a historical event before dying.\"\"Same here. It's an honor!\"The two Priests greeted them.One was a very old man, and the other one was his apprentice.The old man was one of the high-ranking Priests. And the apprentice was a girl of around 20 years old who had lots of talent.They were skillful people, even among the Heavens, who had been chosen to support the Heavenly Being and the Priestess.Before they'd finished their preparations, Radiette said something.\"Ain\u2026\"Hyun and Ain were surprised by his voice.They'd said her name when they\u2019d first met, but he'd never called Ain by her name.Which meant it was the first time he'd used her name to call her.\"Thank you.\"\"\u2026\"\"Thanks to you, I was able to sort it out,\" Radiette said while looking over Ain from head to toe.\"Too small.\"\"\u2026?\"\"Also the age\u2026 Although you're similar, that's it.\"Radiette shook his head.\"I guess I don't need to worry about a user\u2026 But either way, don't die.\"After Radiette finished talking, the four got ready to leave.Next to them there was the carriage they were going to use.In front of the carriage, instead of a normal horse, there was a sacred animal called a dragon-horse.The carriage was also of high quality. There was more than enough space for the four of them.The two Priests rode at the front, and Louise sat in the middle, and Ain at the back.\"I'll be staying here, but I'll help you a bit.\"As Radiette extended his hand toward the carriage, the wind hitting their faces suddenly stopped.And with that, the inside of the carriage became silent.\u2014An invisible protective shield had surrounded the carriage, blocking everything outside.\"It probably won't break.\"\"Then, we're leaving!\"As the female Priest urged the dragon-horse to move, the carriage started to gain speed.Whoosh-!They were moving at an incredible speed.The scenery changed quickly.Although Hyun had never driven a sports car, he thought riding one would probably feel like that.The snow that was accumulated in the plains was flung into the air from the carriage's wheels.The reason why it didn't shake despite moving so fast was probably because of the magic applied to the carriage.The carriage kept moving toward the main magic circle.The oracle had said the Priestess should go with a Heavenly Being and \u00abPray\u00bb with them in the main magic circle.But going there wasn't an easy task.They soon encountered a group that belonged to the Abyss.\"Everyone, hold tight!\"Boom-!As the carriage hit the enemies, they bounced toward the air.It seemed like the shield applied by Radiette was very effective\u2014the enemies that were hit by it were left trembling.The defense shield even deflected the opponents\u2019 long-range attacks.Even while that was happening, the dragon-horse kept running like crazy.From the city toward the magic circle in a straight line, the word \u201csprint\u201d really fitted the situation.\"Hyun\u2026 Look over there.\"A while after the sprint began, Louise suddenly opened her mouth.Her finger was pointed toward the horizon.Louise's face was full of fear.\"The sun is shining\u2026! Wh-what should I do\u2026?!\"Everyone turned their heads around at Louise's urgent voice except for the Priest driving the carriage.Just as she said, the land they'd passed through had started to slowly change colors.The sunlight was falling from the sky.It was a phenomenon that was happening because Iluna's orbit had changed, which made the eclipse change from a full one to a partial one.As the sun began illuminating Iluna, the land was separated into light and darkness.\u2014The black and white boundary was closing in on the carriage.The old Priest groaned.\"Oh, my god, to think that the sun is going to illuminate Iluna...!\"Even if the speed of the carriage was fast, it couldn't be faster than the rotational speed of Iluna.The sunlight started to catch up with the carriage.As the distance with the light grew narrower, Louise's face became pale.Hyun quickly shouted in Ain's voice.\"Is there any place where we can hide from the sun?\"\"Is it okay as long as the sunlight doesn't reach the carriage?!\"\"Yes!\"The female Priest quickly changed the carriage\u2019s direction.They changed the direction to a gap between cliffs, and a few seconds later\u2026Fwoosh-! The sun illuminated Iluna.For the first time in a few thousand years, Iluna's plains full of snow were covered with sunlight.The party was covered by the shadow of a nearby cliff.The carriage started to slow down.\"How long will the sun stay up?\"The female Priest answered at Hyun's mumble.Even in the temple, she was famous for being intelligent. She was good at numerous disciplines on top of theology.\"We're going to enter the eclipse zone in three minutes!\"\"Too tight\u2026\"Hyun bit his lips.\"We're going to stop for a little bit!\"The Priestess pulled the reins and stopped the carriage.They couldn't advance anymore because the shadowed area had ended.\"Oof\u2026\"Louise, while hiding in the shadow, sighed in relief.The party looked at the bright Iluna and anxiously waited for the light to disappear.Just like the Priestess said, it took three minutes before the weather returned to the early evening weather.\"Giddy-up!\"The carriage began moving fast again.Whir- The moment the high Priest\u2019s magic activated, the dragon horse's speed picked up.Hyun wondered if he should use \u00abBiorhythm Acceleration\u00bb but decided not to.An irreversible accident might happen if the dragon-horse couldn't control the buffed speed.Even without the sun, the road was hard.Members of the Abyss and monsters tried to attack themClang-!In the end, Radiette's shield ended up breaking.\"Be careful, Hyun!\"\"It's okay.\"Fwoosh-!Ain activated \u00abEfreet's Claw\u00bb.The fire claws brushed off all the incoming arrows.At the same time, she activated the other claw as well.The two opponents trying to launch a surprise attack entered her attack range and screamed in pain.As they rode further away from the enemies screaming in pain, Ain talked to Hyun via the soul.\u300cHyun, keep watching my back!\u300d\u300cTry to resist. I'll use it at the right time!\u300dSoon, monsters tried to attack all at once.Whir.The effect of \u00abBiorhythm Acceleration\u00bb covered Ain's body.At that moment, Ain's hands moved so fast that they couldn't be seen.The fire claws whipped through Iluna's blizzard!It was a ferocious attack that tore apart and burned tens of monsters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - The Road that Leads (3)After Ain's claws knocked away all of the monsters, Louise could finally relax a little bit.\"Are we not there yet?\"\"We're almost there!\"The party left the carriage near the center city.\"Go where you want.\"As the Priestess whipped the dragon-horse, the empty carriage began zooming toward the plains.\u2014The empty carriage would grab the enemy's attention.They took that opportunity to reach the outskirts of the city.The high-ranking Priest\u2019s voice trembled after looking at the center city, which was completely in ruins.\"Everything was destroyed...\"The place where the main magic circle was also had the biggest city on Iluna. It was a place where hundreds of thousands of people lived.That place where lots of people had lived had become the territory of the dead.\"There are enemies left inside the city!\" The student Priest shouted after spotting an enemy in the distance and prepared to fight.But Hyun quickly lifted his hand and stopped her.\"We can't do a frontal assault.\"Hyun remembered all the details of what Radiette had originally planned.He also hadn't forgotten that they had to reach the main magic circle before midnight.\"We don't have enough time. From here on, we'll have to move while hiding.\"\"Ms. Heavenly Being, is there a way?\"\"We'll have to create one.\"Whir-Hyun once again used a buff.Boom-!Ain used one of the \u00abLatent Potential Increase\u00bb skills.The road that led to the main magic circle wasn't easy.\u2014There was a lizard monster blocking a road they had to go through.By looking at its form and color, Hyun immediately knew its level.\u300cI'll move.\u300d\u00abInvisible\u00bb, \u00abAcceleration\u00bb.Hyun leaped toward it After activating both skills.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 98249 damage!][You've dealt 22948 damage!][Critical Hit! You've dealt 46291 damage!]The first critical hit was much stronger than the rest thanks to the new skill they'd learned.A level 5, \u00abAngel's Basic Sword Art\u00bb almost doubled the damage output of their attack.The lizard monster\u2019s body scattered away into darkness without even being able to scream.\"Let's go.\"After Ain's \u00abLatent Potential Increase\u00bb overlapped four times, they didn't need to use \u00abInvisible\u00bb.The claws of a beast covered with a bloody-red aura cut through the monster's neck.[Critical Hit! You've dealt 151837 damage!][You've dealt more than 33% of the target\u2019s HP as damage!]With that, they separated the guard monster's head from its body.The \u00abAngel's Basic Sword Art\u00bb worked better as a surprise attack rather than in a battle.Killing a monster that was alone wasn't hard at all for Ain.The \u00abEfreet's Claws\u00bb purified numerous monsters.No, should he call it \u00abAngel's Claws\u00bb?She cut the neck, tore the body, and melted the hearts of enemies they encountered along the way.\"It's here!\"While initiating the least amount of battle that was possible, the party reached the main magic circle.The structure of the magic circle was more complicated than imagined.If he'd come alone, he would've lost his way because the main magic circle was formed as a labyrinth.\"Ka! Kaaaa!\"From a distance, they could hear the cries of monsters.It seemed they'd discovered that Hyun and the rest had entered.The high-ranking Priest created a protective shield of light in the corner of the magic circle.They began the ceremony to summon an Angel from their hiding spot.\"Louise, are you ready?\"\"I\u2019ve never prayed, but I'll probably be able to do it.\"Hyun suddenly remembered that Louise didn't have the \u00abPray\u00bb skill.Instead of using a skill, Louise took out a paper that had a very long phrase written on it.It seemed like she hadn't been able to memorize the long prayer.\"We're ready anytime!\"The two Priests, who were standing on each side of Louise, activated an unknown magic.Fwoosh-\u00a0As the two Priests pointed their wands to one place, a sphere of light appeared.Whish-The light coming from the sphere connected to Louise's body.It was the same ceremony as the one used thousands of years ago.In the past, an Angel summoning ceremony had been held at that very place.Iluna was the place closest to the Transcendent's word, which was why it was also the place where it was easier to empathize with them.The Priestess began praying after midnight.'Should I also \u00abPray\u00bb next to her?'* * *Reaper ScansTranslator -\u00a0Daniel ShinProofreader - ilafyJoin our discord for updates on releases!!https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Hyun remembered the contents of the oracle.One Heavenly Being, and one Angel who had probably lost her memories.The oracle had said that they should pray at the same time, so it was probably referring to Louise and him.To \u00abPray\u00bb, he had to descend into his consciousness.But because he was currently \u00abAssimilated\u00bb to Ain, he couldn't close his eyes.It was easier to lower his consciousness if he could close his eyes.Hyun entered the game settings and blocked sight as a sense.\u300cI'm going to close my eyes for a little bit, so if anything dangerous happens, tell me.\u300d\u300cNo problem.\u300dHyun asked Ain to remain alert and slowly began emptying his thoughts.'Was it at level 7?'Hyun recalled the level his \u00abPray\u00bb was at.After reaching level 7 in the Knight's Hall, he'd been able to increase it by one more level.\u00abPray\u00bb level 7 was probably the highest among all users.The only effect it had was increasing the chance of making a casting successful, so only a few beginners learned the skill.He never thought he would increase the proficiency of the skill so much.'As expected.'The moment he began to \u00abPray\u00bb, a foreign feeling entered him.\u2014It was the feelings of another person.The first time he\u2019d used \u00abPray\u00bb, he\u2019d been surprised by the feelings running wild, but now he could analyze the situation with a cool head.\u2018These feelings were probably Louise's.\u2019His proficiency rose the fastest when he was close to Louise or thought about her.After all, using \u00abPray\u00bb was about empathizing with a Transcendent.Even if she'd lost her memories, hadn't Louise been an Angel in the past?'She's probably feeling this same thing, right?'When Hyun had used \u00abPray\u00bb in the Twilight Temple, he\u2019d felt pain and frustration.While using the skill in the Knight's Hall, he\u2019d felt melancholy.Hyun suddenly giggled.He couldn't believe Louise's current feelings.Her heart was beating fast.Rather than fear, she was excited.It was similar to the excitement one felt before leaving for travel\u2026 Why was she feeling something like that while being surrounded by enemies?Hyun let the feelings flow.He had heard that, even for a high-ranking Priest, it wasn't easy to completely immerse yourself in the energy of a Transcendent.That was what was happening inside Hyun's consciousness.Fwoosh-!A huge pillar of light surrounded Louise and Ain.A holy light started to leak from the two while they were praying.Louise had her hands together with her eyes closed in the middle of the blinding light.She looked like a mythical saint who appeared in legends.\"Ah\u2026!\"A blue light penetrated Iluna's atmosphere and rose to space.The old high-priest cried after seeing history repeat itself in front of his eyes.His apprentice also stared blankly at the sky.They'd seen numerous ceremonies throughout the years but had never seen such a strong holy light.The female Priest, who was looking with her mouth agape, suddenly mumbled.\"High Priest, this\u2026!\"\"Yes, we're lucky. There probably aren't many living Priests who have seen this with their own eyes.\"In the Heavens\u2019 history books, it was written like this:When the light filled the world, the Heavens\u2019 legions covered half of Iluna.With the single swing of an Angel\u2019s sword, the Abyss scattered into the light.Was what was written in the books real? Or was it maybe exaggerated with some metaphors mixed in?The high Priest soon discovered that the history books had recorded things just as they happened.A giant door appeared in the sky.Countless dolls of light started to come out.Hundreds... No, thousands!It was an army that could be controlled only by an Angel above Royal ranking.\"Look carefully\u2026 They're soon going to descend\u2026!\"Even after the dolls spread over Iluna, the door remained open.The two Priests looked at the door while holding their breaths.According to the books, after the dolls, an Angel would appear.They'd received oracles for hundreds of years, but nobody had ever seen an angel.The two Priests held their breaths while trying to control their heartbeats.'Hmm\u2026?'While waiting for an Angel to descend, the high Priest's eyebrow wiggled.Something was strange.Even though the Angel still hadn't descended, the door was starting to close!After a while, it returned to its original state.The holy light suddenly turned off.The Angel hadn't descended.The high Priest came to his senses after hearing his apprentice\u2019s screams.\"High Priest! Both of them disappeared!\"\"What?!\"It took him a while to notice.The two who had been praying had suddenly disappeared!The high Priest looked around without understanding what had happened, but they weren't there, it was as if they had never existed in the first place.The faces of the two Priests paled.Until a little while before, both of the missing people had been praying.Where had they gone in that short period?!Only one person had seen what happened from start to finish.'Where's this?'Ain was looking at a world tinted with a red color.It\u2019d happened suddenly.Because the scenery had changed completely, it was as if they'd been teleported while using \u00abPray\u00bb.She was looking at the Symmetrical World.Ain, flustered, called out Hyun.\u300cH-Hyun...?!\u300dBecause his consciousness was in a lowered state, it took him a while to hear Ain's shout.Ain's voice was trembling.\u300cWe suddenly appeared in an unknown place!\u300dAfter coming back to his senses and looking around, Hyun was surprised.\u2014A red world that was illuminated by a black sun.He had been there before.But why at that moment? Why had they suddenly gone to the Symmetrical World?Hyun's eyes widened after looking at the system messages.Because he had blocked his sight, he hadn't been able to read the messages.[The skill\u2019s proficiency has reached 100%!][The level of \u00abPray\u00bb has increased to 8!]'What\u2026?!'For a moment, he couldn't believe it.It\u2019d taken him a few weeks to raise \u00abPray\u00bb to level 7.Not only that, but he had gotten \u00abPray\u00bb to level 7 only a few days before then. How could it already be at 8?To make things weirder, the proficiency rate of \u00abPray\u00bb was already half-full...!\u00abPray\u00bb\u2019s proficiency rate was increasing at an unreasonably fast pace.But he didn't know why.'What happened?'At that moment, he remembered the words of the suspicious female Priest he\u2019d seen at the Twilight Temple.He tried to recall his memories from that day.The female Priest who\u2019d taught him the skill had clearly said this:Usually, \u00abPray\u00bb reaches the Angels\u2026 But praying in the Symmetrical World made \u00abPray\u00bb reach the demons.'Wait, demons\u2026?'After remembering that, Hyun looked right next to him.Hyun inhaled in surprise.Louise, who was praying with her eyes closed, was surrounded by a demonic energy instead of a holy one.The dark energy covering her body was growing so much in size that it looked as if it were about to devour her.\"Stop praying!\" Hyun shouted urgently.She didn't wake up even after he grabbed her shoulders and shook her due to the extremely low state her consciousness was in.Louise only returned to her senses just before she was about to be engulfed by the dark energy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
