He could hear a young girl speak in a soft and gentle voice beside him.Outside the carriage was a sea of buzz and commotion. Hawkers were trying to sell their goods, people were yelling and others exclaiming. Children were making a din.Lu Sheng heaved a deep sigh.He knew he could no longer go back. He was originally a seasoned player in a state-owned enterprise. However, he\u2019d gotten drunk, and when he woke up from his stupor, he found himself in this present world.It had been five days since then.He sniffed at the air, smelling a wafting aroma of wine, mixed with the fragrance of pies and fried nuts.\u201cSigh\u2026 The Osmanthus Winery\u2019s white osmanthus wine is getting more and more fragrant,\u201d the personal servant girl in the carriage, Little Qiao, whispered in a childish voice.Little Qiao was only twelve this year, but with her natural dollish features and petite figure, she looked no different from a ten-year-old.Her small, chubby face carried a natural blush. She donned a small green cotton skirt and her hands were now rubbing a hair tie she was preparing to tie up Lu Sheng\u2019s hair with when they alighted.This kind of hair tie was made of the expensive bark of a species of rubber tree which emanated a light fragrance. The only bad thing about it was that it stiffened when the weather got cold and needed to be warmed and softened by rubbing it with warm hands.Lu Sheng laughed and kept silent. Meanwhile, the carriage quickly came to a stop.He pulled back the carriage\u2019s veil and alighted, stepping onto the greyish white street covered with bluestone tiles, each as big as a face basin.On the street, carriages and horses led by people travelled in either direction. Hawkers chatted with ladies who were out on a stroll, and wives appeared in public and laughed without care or restraint, peals of laughter resounding incessantly on the street.Lu Sheng raised his head and saw the winery ahead. On a white rectangular signboard, three giant words danced \u2013 The Osmanthus Winery.\u201cYoung Master Lu, you\u2019re here! Come in, please! Room A has been reserved for you!\u201d A servant greeted them with a welcoming smile.Lu Sheng nodded. From Little Qiao\u2019s hands, he received a silver-bordered white paper fan and shook it open like a rich young master. A scenery of mountains and a river intertwined with each other was painted onto the fan, and a poem had been written on the side. It was clearly the work of a great literati.He followed the servant into the familiar winery.It was divided into two stories. The hall on the first story was presently filled with many of those who were listening to song performances.A young lady dressed in green stood in the middle of the empty space, her clear voice twisting and turning melodiously. Beside her, a middle-aged woman was playing a lute.The song being performed was called Three Meetings, a tragic love story about a general on a mission of conquest and a fox lady in the mountain wilderness.But it was a shame that those present were a boorish bunch, and only few somewhat cultured ones among them were barely able to understand the song. The rest of them treated the two ladies like thin air.Those who tipped were even fewer.Lu Sheng paused. Seeing how lively it was, he sat down on an empty seat on the first story.\u201cWho picked Three Meetings?\u201d He asked the servant casually.He held an uncommon status here in The Osmanthus Winery. Had it been an upscale place of entertainment on Earth, he would have been a VVIP guest: a patron whose annual spending was at least in five digits.In a small northern city like this Nine Links City, such spending was enough to make one a VVIP customer.\u201cIt\u2019s Young Master Zhou. Young Master Zhou Que,\u201d the servant replied softly.Not intending to make things difficult for him, Lu Sheng dismissed him with a wave of his hand.After pulling Little Qiao down onto a seat, his gaze swept the crowd on the first story and quickly landed on a pale and frail gentleman clad in white robes. He was fanning himself lightly with an ugly gold fan he held in his hand.\u201cI bet he\u2019s targeting that young girl who\u2019s singing,\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head.\u201cYoung Master just warned him last time. That lad\u2019s really a rotten egg!\u201d Little Qiao pouted angrily. [1]Lu Sheng smiled and no longer said anything. He started listening to the song quietly.Dishes soon filled the top of the mahogany table. Lu Sheng grabbed some stir-fried meat slices with lettuce and started eating.He also drank a mouthful of white osmanthus wine, drinking it as if it were a normal beverage. The faint and sweet floral fragrance mixed up in it made it taste like fruit juice.\u2018Food and clothing fit for royalty, without any lack or want, and I\u2019ve even got a pretty servant girl to warm my bed\u2026 this lifestyle is way too decadent,\u2019 sometimes, Lu Sheng would think about simply living the rest of his life this way. The pursuit of his previous life was to eat, drink and laze around anyway.He ate another mouthful of dishes, and drank another mouthful of wine. Then, he opened his mouth so Little Qiao could put in a salted ice prawn she had just shelled.Those ice prawns were the local specialty of this snowy northern city. Just a casual scoop in a thick ice hole would draw up a large amount of translucent prawns.Those were ice prawns.They were half the length of a normal prawn but were a fresh delicacy. The meat melted instantly in one\u2019s mouth, serving up an indescribable gastronomic pleasure.Of course, it was extremely pricey.It was already considered extravagant for an average person to eat it once a month. Who could enjoy it during every meal like him?Lu Sheng enjoyed the delicacies and wine before him while listening to the song, but his mind was elsewhere.He had already arrived in this ancient China-like world for so many days. Yet, according to his observations, this world was riddled with many strange happenings.Initially, he\u2019d thought that he had gone back into the ancient times, but later he discovered otherwise.The customs, the habits, the weather and the climate here were all vastly different from those during the times of any other dynasty or in any place that he knew of.As he was thinking of these things, the winery\u2019s main doors opened again.A group of muscular men dressed in short robes filed in, finding a table near the corner and sitting down immediately.These muscular men were clearly not locals. Their dressing indicated that they seemed to have come from the Central Plains. Neither their clothing nor bearing were as rough as the northerners.\u201cAi\u2026\u201dThe leader among them was a bald man with bronze earrings and a fierce-looking face. Yet here he was, sighing.\u201cThe days are getting worse.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, big brother. If we can\u2019t go past Lee Village, we\u2019ll just take the second route. Skirting around Zhang Village will work, too,\u201d another man said with a frown.\u201cWhat do you know? I came to meet up with you guys precisely via that route. They\u2019re not much better off than the people at Lee Village\u2026 there\u2019s plenty of dead there too,\u201d the bald man\u2019s fierce-looking face trembled and turned even more sorrowful.\u201cWhat on earth happened? Tell us big brother, so we can learn a thing or two,\u201d a man urged.The bald muscular man sighed again. \u201cI don\u2019t know the specifics either. I just know that quite a few fishing villages by the Sui Yang Lake have been affected. Seems like a water ghost has been haunting them.\u201d\u201cWater ghost!? No way!\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s table was not far from them and he could hear their conversation which they made no effort to conceal.At first, he was simply listening for fun, but little did he expect that those men started chatting about some superstitious things.The Lu family in his present life was one of the several most wealthy families in this snowy northern city. Saying that they lived high off the hog would be an understatement.If it was on Earth, they would be at least billionaires.During those past few days, coming out for a drink, he had heard more than a few rumors about demons, spirits, gods and ghosts in the winery. But they were largely gossip.This was the first case that involved people who had a personal encounter, so Lu Sheng raised his ears and eavesdropped attentively on their conversation.It was a good thing that they did not hush it up. They continued chatting loudly about the strange occurrences in the fishing villages.\u201cThat water ghost\u2026 I saw it with my own eyes\u2026 it was over ten feet tall, with a green face and fangs, covered with lots of seaweed. Oh my goodness, if I, your big brother, didn\u2019t run fast enough, you wouldn\u2019t be able to see me now,\u201d the bald man was still having the shivers as he recalled it.\u201cBig brother, is the water ghost real?\u201d One of them was skeptical.\u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t make up this story?\u201d Another of them sneered.Having heard to this point, Lu Sheng found it funny too. It was probably another boast by some boor from god-knows-where. He had seen many of his kind in this world.Having eaten something and drunk some wine, he made a servant bring over the singing lady\u2019s song list and casually looked it over.Three Meetings was not bad, but didn\u2019t suit the atmosphere. He wanted to change it to a more joyous tune.\u201cPA!\u201dBut, right at that moment, the bald man slapped the table with his palm, his face now red.\u201cYou really think that I, Boss Hu, only knows how to boast!? Look, look at what this is! That\u2019s a piece of bone left behind by the water ghost! I secretly picked it up after the incident!\u201dHe retrieved a piece of jade-like green stone gingerly from his chest and slapped the tabletop with it.\u201cIsn\u2019t that just a piece of mixed jade?\u201d One of them sneered.\u201cMixed jade? This is mixed jade?! Go eat crap!\u201d The bald man\u2019s face was red with rage.\u201cThis brother over here. Can you show me that thing?\u201dA mild voice rang out from the side suddenly.Lu Sheng was standing beside their table with a smile on his face. His gaze swept across the green piece of jade on the tabletop.\u201cThis thing\u2026 you dare to take it? This was left behind by a water ghost,\u201d the bald man remarked in surprise.He had merely taken it out to show it off for a while and was planning to throw it away a little later.After all, it was left behind by something inhuman. If it led the water ghost to him, he would really be in deep trouble.\u201cIt\u2019s ok. I just want to take a look,\u201d Lu Sheng did not believe in any tale about a water ghost. It just seemed to him that the piece of jade would sell well; it looked different from your average jade.The average mixed jade could be purchased from shops and stalls everywhere. It was casually polished from jadeite corners and was extremely cheap.But, for some strange reason, the moment he saw this piece of jade, he knew something was different about it.The bald Boss Hu glanced at Lu Sheng and saw that he carried an extraordinary aura about him, dressed in clothes worn by the rich.He wore a green robe and a white fox fur jacket. On his head was a jade officer hat, and on his feet, there were black-soled shoes with cloud patterns embroidered on them with silver threads.The cost of his entire outfit was enough to pay for a few months\u2019 worth of spending at The Osmanthus Winery\u2026 and probably enough to equal an average household\u2019s annual expenditure as well.\u201cWell, Young Master, if you want it, er\u2026 just a talent of silver will do!\u201d The muscular man ventured after some hesitation.\u201cDeal,\u201d Lu Sheng let Little Qiao take out a talent of silver and place it on the table.\u201cIt\u2019s yours now,\u201d the bald man took the jade and stuffed it in Lu Sheng\u2019s hands decisively. The few of them exchanged glances with each other, rose from the table and left.Without another word, Lu Sheng watched them leave. He held up the jade in his hand for a closer examination.\u2018A talent of silver. If this was China on Earth, then we\u2019re talking about a thousand Chinese dollars\u2019 worth of purchasing power. Only in this life can I spend so extravagantly,\u2019 he shook his head. A talent of silver meant nothing to him. According to the memories of his present body, his average monthly expenditure was at least above a hundred talents of silver. [2]Occasionally, he would even spend up to a thousand talents and more. That equaled millions on today\u2019s Earth!Thinking of this, he complained in his heart about what a prodigal the previous host of this body had been.Ignoring the stares of the surrounding onlookers, he held onto the jade, called Little Qiao and left the winery, heading towards the horse carriage waiting outside.Yet right after stepping out of the winery, before he was even halfway there, he abruptly stood still and placed the jade in the heart of his palm.There and then, in the middle of his right palm, the jade started melting!In a matter of seconds, the originally hard rock dissolved into a pool of dark green goo. A faint but terrible scream came out from the goo.\u201cPoof!\u201dWithout warning, the goo exploded into a ball of green smoke and gradually dispersed in front of Lu Sheng.He stood rooted to the ground in shock. Refocusing his sight, he saw that the jade was still in his palm, but the green sheen within it had vanished silently.\u2018Just now that was\u2026\u2019He stood on the spot blankly, continuously recalling the image he had just seen.\u201cYoung Master? Young Master???\u201d Little Qiao kept calling out beside him.Lu Sheng snapped out of his reverie and looked at the jade in his hand once again. It was now nothing more than an ordinary cobblestone; not even a vestige of jade remained.Hair stood on the back of his neck. Imperceptibly, he seemed to understand something.\u201cLet\u2019s go. Back to the manor!\u201dLittle Qiao blinked and took a while to react. \u201cOkay\u2026\u201dBoth of them boarded the carriage. The driver gave a few whips and two black hairy horses began to advance slowly.In the carriage, Lu Sheng did not make a sound. He just kept staring at the cobblestone in his palm. At this point, Little Qiao too discovered the change in the stone.\u2018We got scammed again!\u2019 She muttered in her heart but did not say much. \u2018Young Master\u2019s considered alright this time. The biggest scam he fell for in the past was that supposedly ancient wine flask. It cost over a thousand silver talents and almost drove Old Master to his grave. It\u2019s just a talent of silver this time. Sometimes Young Master\u2019s meal costs more than that.\u2019The horse carriage headed straight for the manor. As it passed by the city gates, Lu Sheng heard shouts from the outside.\u201c\u2026I heard a while back that the water ghost has been exorcized! A travelling priest saved the fishing villages from danger!\u201d\u201cHas the court sent anyone?\u201d\u201cYeah, already quite some time ago. I heard even the prefectural yamen\u2019s Chief Constable Ouyang almost lost his life. Good thing he met a travelling priest. According to the news, when the priest attacked, there was a blinding golden flash and the water ghost cried out pathetically before turning into green goo. Afterward, it just exploded into thick smoke and then dispersed.\u201d [3]\u201cSo it wasn\u2019t attacked by the court\u2019s experts?\u201d\u201cOf course not!\u201dLu Sheng could tell that it was the officers on guard duty chit-chatting.He would often intentionally pass by the gates on this side of the city. The soldiers on guard duty were well-informed of the latest news and loved to brag and bullshit about strange news from all over the region.\u2018What a coincidence\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng\u2019s face betrayed nothing.Recalling that piece of jade from earlier, his heart sank.Meanwhile, the horse carriage lumbered on toward Ku Rong Street \u2013 the most prosperous part of the city.[1] ED/N: Before Lu Sheng was addressed \u201cyoung master\u201d, whereas here the servant girl adds the character for \u201cbig\u201d, which has a more respectful sound to it. While I\u2019m not a TL so I can\u2019t tell for sure with my much worse Chinese, it seems to mean that he\u2019s the oldest son of his parents (which is a fact) or the oldest youth in his generation in his family (branch families likely do not count). It could also mean that he\u2019s the first in line to inherit the family head\u2019s position. Later on, she\u2019ll also use this form of address (but also at least one more word that also translates to \u201cyoung master\u201d). There are many ways to say \u201cyoung master\u201d in Chinese, but we\u2019ll always translate them as \u201cyoung master\u201d (sometimes we\u2019ll use capital letters to emphasize the instances where it\u2019s a translation of a more respectful Chinese version).[2] ED/N: Chinese dollars = Yuan = Renminbi. While only the latter two names are official (as far as I know that is), the first one also be heard from time to time.[3] ED/N: \u201cYamen\u201d is the word for a government office that existed during feudalism in China.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Lu Manor was one of the houses there.The horse carriage headed straight down Ku Rong Street and entered into a garden area.This area was surrounded by greyish-white stone walls, forming a huge oval shape.On the left of the area was where the Lu Manor was located.The manor was the very image of quiet and tranquility, with black doors flanked by red lanterns and two stone chimeras, now covered with a white layer of snow.The horse carriage stopped at the entrance of the Lu Manor, where Lu Sheng alighted. People within the mansion had long since heard the sound of him approaching and unhurriedly opened the doors. A chamberlain awaited at the entrance.As soon as Lu Sheng and Little Qiao passed through the doors, they saw a good-looking man and a woman standing together on a stone bridge to the right of the residence.The man was dashing, confident and with a brilliant countenance. He had sharp brows and sparkling eyes, and there was a thick aura of a Confucian scholar around him.The woman looked soft and gentle, her eyes beautiful as if taken from a painting. She had slender waist and long legs; her manner was that of a well-bred girl from a wealthy family.Seeing the two of them, Lu Sheng\u2019s train of thought was briefly interrupted. His mood lifted somewhat, and took the initiative to go over to greet them.\u201cElder Brother Xu, why are you here only today? My little cousin has missed you for the past days,\u201d he smiled as he walked on the stone bridge.The man smiled as he turned and caught sight of Lu Sheng. \u201cSo it\u2019s Young Master Sheng. Earlier, I had to follow orders to investigate into something, a case which had just been resolved. I came to see Yiyi as soon as I could. Don\u2019t blame me for this, I couldn\u2019t disobey orders from the higher ups.\u201d\u201cA case? Has there recently been a case so big that Elder Brother Xu needed to personally take care of it?\u201d Lu Sheng knew that Elder Brother Xu Daoran was of a high position.He was a County Lord who was overall in charge of law and order in all of the counties within Nine Links City area.The position of a County Lord was second only to that of the County Magistrate, and was akin to that of a Police Commissioner.\u201cJust some cases in the fishing villages, but they\u2019ve been resolved,\u201d Xu Daoran smiled warmly. \u201cAlthough, Little Sheng, when are you coming to help me? You promised me previously that you would come to help me out in planning for the city\u2019s law and order.\u201dHow could Lu Sheng remember everything this body\u2019s previous host had promised in the past? He gave a perfunctory laugh and hurried to change the subject.\u201cFishing villages? Don\u2019t tell me it has to do with the rumored water ghost?\u201d\u201cWhat water ghost! It was just a lunatic driven to madness by his desire for revenge who went on a killing spree. I have already beheaded him at the scene!\u201d Xu Daoran shook his head and said indifferently. \u201cThe case has been resolved, let\u2019s not dampen our spirits by harping on these matters. Little Sheng, do you still remember what I promised Yiyi previously?\u201d\u201cTo offer joss-sticks in Red Lotus Temple, and take a hike while you\u2019re at it?\u201d Lu Sheng swiftly replied with a smile.\u201cYou sure remember these play things very well,\u201d Xu Daoran helplessly replied and added, \u201cYou\u2019re no longer young\u2026 nineteen-year-old this year, was it? You should find some work to do. You can\u2019t expect to live the rest of your life like this, can you?\u201dHe had watched Lu Sheng grow up. Because their families had been long-time friends, he had always seen Lu Sheng as his younger brother.Now, he felt that he had to offer a few words of advice.Lu Sheng shook his head and laughed. \u201cElder Brother Xu, do you want me to become an official, or a businessman?\u201d\u201cAn official, of course. This is also your father\u2019s wish. Your maternal and paternal uncles both hope that you can come over and help them as soon as possible. After all, you\u2019re the eldest son of the Lu family,\u201d Xu Daoran persuaded.\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this first. It\u2019s not urgent, not urgent at all! I\u2019m still young. What logic is there behind this hurry to chase the eldest son out?\u201d Unconcerned, Lu Sheng replied randomly in a casual tone.Xu Daoran and Lu Yiyi were both speechless, and did not continue the topic.Lu Sheng did not want to dwell on the subject of being an official. He changed the subject, and walked off with Little Qiao in the direction of his sleeping quarters.Once he got there, he changed his clothes. Without even going to greet his father, he then took the piece of cobblestone and went alone to the garden at the back of the manor.Xu Daoran was born in the Xu family which, like the Lu family, was one of the most illustrious families in this northern city that is Nine Links. Their members had far-reaching influence, and held important positions in all areas of the city.Lu Sheng felt rather kindly disposed towards Xu Daoran; he was a sincere and honest guy, without selfish motives, and was genuinely interested in Yiyi.To Lu Sheng, he was as close as an elder brother.Except\u2026Lu Sheng grasped onto the cobblestone, once again thinking back to the earlier scene. He thought back to what he had incidentally heard at the city gates, about how the water ghost had been killed.\u2018In this world, are there ghosts and immortals\u2026?\u2019There was a faint, indescribable gloom in his heart as he gazed at the snow swirling in the garden.\u2018Perhaps it\u2019s just as Elder Brother Xu said\u2026 it\u2019s just a false rumor spread by the people,\u2019 he shook his head, grasping onto a thread of wishful thinking in his heart.Early in the evening, he returned to his room to wash and sleep. The day\u2019s events had left him befuddled. With so many things on his mind, he quickly grew tired.He slept through the night, up until sunrise.\u201cDONG DONG DONG! DONG DONG DONG!\u201dThe sound of frantic knocks arose.Lu Sheng abruptly opened his eyes, shot up from the bed and looked towards the door.\u201cWho is it?!\u201d\u201cYoung Master\u2026! There\u2019s been trouble\u2026!\u201d It was Little Qiao\u2019s voice.Lu Sheng hurriedly got off his bed to open the door. Outside, Little Qiao stood there with a terrifyingly pale face, devoid of all color. The fat cheeks on her baby face were currently trembling uncontrollably.\u201cXu\u2026 Xu\u2026 Xu\u2026\u201dSeeing this, an ominous sense of crisis began to rise in Lu Sheng\u2019s heart.\u201cJust what happened? Take a deep breath!\u201d He raised his hand to pat Little Qiao\u2019s back vigorously.Only then was Little Qiao able to breathe normally.\u201cThe Xu family\u2026 Lord Xu\u2019s family\u2019s all finished!!\u201d She said in one breath, sobbing.Lu Sheng was stupefied.Little Qiao speedily helped Lu Sheng into his outer robes. Without saying another word, they both sped towards the outer manor.The patriarch of the Lu family, Lu Fang, was standing outside the manor. He had his hands behind his back, a hint of a tremble on his crestfallen face.Three huge black double horse carriages waited next to him.Lu Sheng, along with his other cousins within the manor, hastily paid respects to Lu Fang before promptly boarding the carriages.Lu Fang and Lu Sheng sat together, father and son both silent as they faced each other. Neither spoke a word while on the carriage.Lu Fang was over sixty years of age. With a white beard, skinny build and handsome features, he looked more like a distinguished scholar rather than a businessman.The horse carriages advanced without slowing down. It wasn\u2019t long till they arrived outside the Nine Links City\u2019s gates.Lu Sheng alighted from the carriage, and was shocked by the scene before his eyes.To the left of the carriageway outside the city gates, ten corpses lay neatly on the snow. From young to old, from men to women\u2026 they were all of the Xu family!All of them were clad in robes custom-made for the Xu household. Xu Daoran lay in the middle of the third row.His face was ashen, his body stiff and eyes shut tightly. His expression was one of extreme fear, just as if he had seen something immensely terrifying before his death.Lu Sheng saw the constables maintaining order at the scene. He saw his own father, Lu Fang, standing in front of an old man\u2019s corpse, not saying a word with his fists clenched tightly.The Prefect, having heard the news, was also present, his face as white as the snow surrounding them.Lu Sheng took a deep breath and walked slowly to stand next to a constable. \u201cHow did they die?\u201dThat constable recognized him and knew who he was. He sighed.\u201cAll of them died in their own manor, hung by seaweed from the house beams. No idea where the seaweed came from\u2026\u201d\u201cYiyi! Yiyi!!\u201dA cry of alarm suddenly sounded out from behind. Obviously, little cousin Yiyi had fainted.Lu Sheng heaved a deep sigh, recalling what Xu Daoran had said to him only the day before.He had just returned from solving cases in the fishing villages\u2026Fishing villages\u2026Water ghost\u2026That bizarre piece of cobblestone\u2026In that moment, many thoughts went through Lu Sheng\u2019s mind.In actuality, he had only been in this world for a couple of days, and did not have any deep attachment to Xu Daoran. Therefore, he only felt a sense of regret and shock at the moment. However, he did not feel the grief others would have expected of him.It\u2019s not that he had never seen corpses before.Rather, it\u2019s just that he had never seen this many corpses before.\u201cWhere is Priest Chi Ling of the Xu household?\u201d He heard Lu Fang asking the senior constable.\u201cIn another area. The corpse has been split into many chunks, one of which has even been gnawed at by a beast\u2026\u201d the senior constable replied in a low voice.A spell of silence.Be it the Lu family, the Prefect or the commoners looking on from the city gates, they were all silent.\u201cPriest Chi Ling is quick with his sword, and is even a cut above Uncle Zhao\u2026\u201d Lu Fang gradually lowered his voice.Uncle Zhao was the strongest martial arts master employed by the Lu family. Priest Chi Ling was stronger than Uncle Zhao, and yet he was killed.This was no longer a simple murder case, but a grave danger that was enough to threaten everyone present!Of all the people present, who would dare say that he was mightier than the Xu family?No one would dare say so, not even the Prefect.Lu Sheng stood silently on the roadside. He\u2019d initially thought that this world was very safe and was but an imitation of the ancient China, that\u2019s all. There were some surprising occurrences, but nothing too serious.But now, it seemed\u2026He touched the cobblestone that was in his sleeve pocket.The cobblestone was shockingly hot at the moment.He took out the cobblestone, hesitated for a bit, and then lightly threw it away.This item might just bring calamity upon him.The Xu family had a foundation as robust as his own Lu family, and yet was entirely wiped out in the span of a single night.This caused Lu Sheng to be greatly alarmed in his heart.He deliberated, and suddenly walked over to the right of the cobblestone, bent over, and picked it up.\u201cPsss.\u201dUnknowingly, his forefinger had been accidentally cut by wild grass jutting out from the snow-covered ground.It was a special kind of grass. The sides of its leaves were sharp as the edge of a blade.Lu Sheng\u2019s finger was immediately sliced and bled, a few drops of blood dripping onto the cobblestone.\u201cYoung Master?\u201d Little Qiao followed closely behind him, somewhat anxious, with tears streaming down her small face. Clearly, Xu Daoran\u2019s death was a huge blow to her.Lu Sheng\u2019s body was frozen on the spot.A series of extremely unique syllables suddenly floated across his mind.\u201cWelcome to the Deep Blue Skills Cheating Device.\u201dIn a moment, Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes went into a daze. Quite a while passed before he was back to himself.He stared at the translucent, bluish square frame floating before his eyes. Astonishingly, in it he could see his name and all skills he currently mastered.\u2018Isn\u2019t this\u2026 the little cheating device I wrote for a mobile phone app?!\u2019Lu Sheng felt like he was going mad, having one hallucination after another.It was bad enough that he had been reincarnated into this Young Master of a wealthy family, who barely had the strength to truss a chicken. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, he was actually having all sorts of hallucinations now!In his previous life, he had downloaded a little game called Chronicles of Flying Swords and Heroes when he was bored. However, because the game was too difficult, he had programmed a simple cheating device to modify his martial arts in the game.He had named it the Deep Blue Cheating Device. Come to think of it, the voice he had heard earlier was his own, recorded through a voice-changing device.Never did he expect\u2026Lu Sheng looked resolutely into the space within the square frame.The space was remarkably simple. There were only numerous small boxes, packed densely together.On it were written:Lu Sheng \u2013 \u2013Martial Arts: None.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Or not a hallucination?\u2019Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes narrowed. He suppressed the doubts in his heart.\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he replied calmly, straightening his back.\u201cYoung Master\u2026 Lord Xu and the rest, they all were such good men. Such good officials. How can it be\u2026?\u201d Little Qiao\u2019s eyes welled up with tears and she started crying.Lu Sheng stared silently at the Xu family corpses that lay on the floor.All of them were greenish gray and had ligature marks on their necks.The Prefect glanced at them a few times and then left hurriedly, leaving it for the Chief Constable in charge of the case to handle.Several yamen officials, who were also responsible for investigation, went aside to discuss the case with the Chief Constable.\u201cYoung Master, Old Master asks you to come over,\u201d a servant ran to Lu Sheng and whispered to him while looking sympathetically at the corpses of the Xu family members lying on the ground.\u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d Lu Sheng glanced at the servant. \u201cAre you scared?\u201d\u201cI am scared,\u201d the servant was merely eighteen or nineteen, yet carried an air of maturity beyond his age about him. \u201cBut, your servant is a refugee from Ju Rong Nation in the east. There\u2019s a famine over there now. Corpses are all over the ground everywhere. Quite a few people even trade their children with each other to eat them. Pitiful scenes like this are commonplace\u2026 ai\u2026\u201dHe sighed. But realizing quickly that he was not chatting with one of his friends, he immediately bowed his head.\u201cCommonplace? Are there many of such incidents in Ju Rong nation in the east?\u201d Lu Sheng asked casually.The servant fell into silence for a moment. \u201cMore than a few.\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s heart tightened.Without a pause in his steps, he quickly walked to the father of his present self \u2013 Lu Fang.Lu Fang. Other name \u2013 Quanan, a.k.a. the Golden Dollar Man.Lu Quanan\u2019s wealth was famous even in the entire Nine Links City. News that the Lu and Xu Family were about to be joined by marriage had also spread throughout the city. Even people from Zi Hua City in the west had come to present their wedding gifts.To think that a topic as hot and event as celebrated as this would come to end in such a manner.Presently, Lu Quanan\u2019s face was extremely ugly. Heavy fatigue and worry were visible in his eyes.\u201cTell Constable Zhao about yesterday\u2019s situation in detail.\u201dHe moved aside to make space for an approaching bearded man.In his mind, Lu Sheng kept replaying what he had heard from Xu Daoran yesterday. He believed that the water ghost case must be related to the Xu Family deaths. So, he recounted his conversation with Xu Daoran the previous day.He didn\u2019t hide anything.Chief Constable Zhao\u2019s brows knit together. He, too, saw no major clue in the entire affair.Seeing that there were no more questions for him, Lu Sheng departed.Before leaving, the yamen\u2019s men began to clean up the corpses.Lu Sheng stared for a while from the sidelines. When he saw Xu Daoran being lifted up on the stretcher, he sighed and approached a constable nearby and asked,\u201d Brother, are there any surviving members of the Xu family?\u201dHe thought that if there were any survivors from the Xu family, he would take care of him or her and perhaps even learn some useful information from them.\u201cNope\u2026 they\u2019re all gone. Even their external relatives\u2019 entire families were implicated. Perhaps they\u2019ve still got a few distant relatives in Zi Hua city,\u201d the constable shook his head and whispered.Lu Sheng quietly stuffed a silver coin into his hand. Then, taking Little Qiao along with him, he boarded the horse carriage with his family.The horse carriage headed back towards home.However, the Xu family\u2019s pitiful state was still on everyone\u2019s minds.As the head of the family, Lu Fang aka Lu Quanan assembled everyone for a family meeting and announced that the engagement with Xu family was void from now on and the women were to console Yiyi. Then, he returned by himself to rest in his room.One by one, the young men in the family went out, be it to the winery in the city, or to the brothel and other similar establishments. That was their usual way of numbing themselves to traumatic events.As for the women, they went out to the nearby Red Lotus Temple to pray for peace and protection.Ideally, they would come back with a talisman from the Red Lotus priest which would protect the family from invasion by any external evils.The entire Lu family was fraught with fear.But Lu Sheng did not go out. Instead, he brought Little Qiao with him and headed for the library where the family kept its books.The library was in absolute silence. He pushed the doors open and entered to see a plump woman wiping the shelves.The mahogany shelves and furniture as well as the faint light streaming in from the windows gave this place an eerie atmosphere.Lu Sheng went past the wooden partition blocking the entrance, which featured a circular painting of flowers and birds, sniffing the faint fragrance of wood in the library.\u201cTake your leave first. I\u2019ll read some books by myself and take a rest,\u201d he instructed.\u201cYes,\u201d Little Qiao replied obediently and left together with the plump cleaning woman.Standing alone in the library and staring at the rows of shelves before him, Lu Sheng sighed. Then, he began to search the shelves one by one.Very quickly, he found some sort of local prefectural record books. Taking all of these books out of the shelves, he began flipping through them one by one.Using the faint light streaming in from the windows, he quickly browsed through one of them from cover to cover.\u201cIn the seventy-second year of the Great Song, a man appeared in the outskirts of Nine Links City and slaughtered twelve with a saber in a frenzy. Killed after being surrounded and attacked by yamen constables.\u201d\u201cIn the eighty-fifth year of the Great Song, on the streets in downtown Nine Links City, a man\u2019s head was suddenly separated from his body. Cause of death remains unknown.\u201d\u201cIn the ninety-first year of the Great Song, tourists went missing in the deserted temple outside the city, numbering at least fifteen. Case remains unsolved till the current date.\u201d\u201cIn the ninety-fifth year of the Great Song, the owner of Nine Links City Music Plaza went missing. His limbs were later discovered in four different locations of the city. The corpse had already decomposed into bones despite only four days passing since his death.\u201d\u201cIn the hundred and sixteenth year of the Great Song, a baby\u2019s cry from outside the city was heard at night. Those sent to investigate all went missing. The sounds of crying could be heard for three days before vanishing by themselves.\u201d***Reading the records of these cases, both big and small, Lu Sheng grew increasingly shocked and terrified. It was deeply unnerving.It was truly no simple feat for people to retain their sanity and live normally in a world like this, grave danger awaiting at every step.He opened another book. It was even more exaggerated than the previous one.\u201cIn the hundred and nineteenth year of the Great Song, a blizzard broke out in Nine Links. The Dragon Lord was rumored to have appeared somewhere, causing the snow to stop in three days. Three days later, the blizzard that lasted for more than ten days ended abruptly.\u201d\u201cIn the hundred and twenty-eighth year of the Great Song, fog appeared on the road leading towards Zi Hua City. Those who entered the fog would lose their bearings and appear mysteriously by the coast of the White Frozen Sea several miles away. Ten days later, the fog disappeared.\u201dHaving read till this point, Lu Sheng was almost certain that this world was not as simple as he had thought. Demons, ghosts and monsters probably really existed here.At least he currently knew of no method in this world which could manipulate the weather.He shifted the chair, picked up a flint and lit up the candles on the table. Their bright yellow flame flickered, casting shadows on his face.\u201cIf this world is truly as dangerous as I think, then what do I need to protect myself? What can I use to protect myself?\u201dHe asked himself and thought about this question for a moment by the table.Then, rising slowly, Lu Sheng blew out the candle and returned all the books on the table to their places on the shelves.He pushed the doors open and stepped out.\u201cYoung Master, you\u2019re done reading?\u201dLittle Qiao was dozing off, her back against the door. She was caught by surprise when Lu Sheng suddenly came out, but still reacted quickly.\u201cMm. Where\u2019s Uncle Zhao now? Do you know?\u201d Lu Sheng asked casually.There were many surnamed Zhao and of similar age in the Lu Manor, but only one of them was known to all as Uncle Zhao.He was the one whom even Lu Fang addressed as Uncle Zhao, the number one expert and the strongest martial arts master in the Lu family \u2013 Zhao Dahu.\u201cEr\u2026 at this time of a day Uncle Zhao is usually at the martial arts arena, tempering his bones and training the servants,\u201d Little Qiao was on good terms with other servants and so was rather well-informed.\u201cLet\u2019s go find him.\u201dLu Sheng thought long and hard. Uncle Zhao was the easiest person within his reach from whom he could learn some self-preservation skills.Walking along the path in the manor, Lu Sheng quickly traversed two stretches of sleeping quarters and arrived at the back of the manor.Atop a big arena, a white-haired elder was leading more than ten servants in practicing martial arts.The light of the morning sun washed down on them, gradually lightening Lu Sheng\u2019s heart which was heavy with the terrible events he had learned of in the morning.The martial arts master Zhao Dahu wore an outfit of short athletic robes, consisting of a black top and grey pants. On his back, he carried a giant thick-backed saber that never left his body.Lu Sheng waited and observed on the side.On the arena, Zhao Dahu trained the servants for a while, then let them train on their own in pairs against each other.He himself, however, approached Lu Sheng. He had noticed Lu Sheng much earlier already.\u201cYoung Master, what brought you here today to the arena? Is there something for which you need an old man\u2019s help?\u201dZhao Dahu\u2019s status in the manor was more or less equal to that of Old Master\u2019s.There were also several other martial arts masters whose status was not low and interacted with these young masters and ladies as equals.Lu Sheng glanced at the servants who were still practicing their moves not far away.\u201cUncle Zhao, I wish to learn martial arts,\u201d as the words left Lu Sheng\u2019s mouth, Zhao Dahu\u2019s smile momentarily froze on his face.\u201cBig Brother Sheng, you haven\u2019t come here to pull an old man\u2019s leg, have you?\u201d [1]\u201cI\u2019m not pulling your leg,\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head.He had given it more than enough thought. The easiest and the only available way for him to acquire some self-preservation skills was to start by learning from the martial arts masters in his own house.And among those in the entire Nine Links City, the ones who could best the saber technique of the martial arts master in his own house \u2013 Zhao Dahu aka Uncle Zhao \u2013 could be counted on one hand.Zhao Dahu looked at Lu Sheng seriously and shook his head. \u201cIf Brother Sheng is serious about learning martial arts, then what this old man is capable of, I can impart to you. But\u2026 you\u2019re too old, so your bones\u2019 shape is fixed and you won\u2019t be able to execute many of the moves properly at all. And if you can\u2019t execute them properly, then the might of this skill will be greatly reduced\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Uncle Zhao, just teach it to me.\u201dLu Sheng was not merely seeking some self-preservation skill, but also to test and verify something.Zhao Dahu fell deep in thought for a moment. Finally, he straightforwardly agreed.\u201cMight as well, then. I\u2019ve got no heir\u2026 and having lived with the Lu family for so many years, it\u2019s been a good life and Old Master has been good to us. If we go by the book, you\u2019re learning my craft and so must perform the discipleship ceremony. But given my relationship with the Lu family, forget about becoming my disciple. Just don\u2019t leak my craft out to anyone else,\u201d Zhao Dahu said with a wave of his hand.As the eldest son in the family, it was only a matter of time before Lu Sheng took over all businesses and properties under the Lu Manor.So, he also harbored intentions of pulling him closer to himself.\u201cBut, Brother Sheng, there\u2019s something I need to make clear to you beforehand.\u201d\u201cPlease speak,\u201d Lu Sheng replied earnestly.Zhao Dahu caressed the beard on his chin and said in a low voice. \u201cI know you want to learn martial arts for self-protection because of the terrible Xu family case from this morning. But let me set this straight. Not even the strongest experts in the pugilistic world can handle these strange and weird things, mired in odd mystery as they are. \u201d\u201c\u2026I got it,\u201d Lu Sheng nodded. \u201cI just\u2026 feel unsettled. I\u2019ll simply do what I can.\u201d\u201cAs long as Brother Sheng understands.\u201d Zhao Dahu thought for a moment, then pulled out a small booklet from his chest, wrapped in layers and layers of yellow cloth. Meticulously, he slowly unwrapped it, revealing the booklet underneath.Several big words were written on the cover: \u201cBlack Tiger Saber Technique.\u201d[1] ED/N: The Big Brother here means something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019ll flatter you a bit, so stop joking around/messing with me, would you?\u201d Similar way of addressing others can be often seen in novels in similar situations (the one I\u2019ve seen the most times was Big Brother, followed by Aunt)\u2026 or so I thought, but the old codger still keeps on using it, so just keep in mind that it can be used this way\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Kurisu\u201cThis is a basic saber technique that a wandering priest imparted to me when I met him by chance in my youth. In the pugilistic world, it can be considered a third-class martial art. But don\u2019t underestimate it because of that. It\u2019s got its strengths. Third-class secret manuals are good enough to make it into restricted libraries of great sects.Take it back and read it seriously, including the detailed posture diagrams. Follow them and practice by yourself for now. If you\u2019re sure that you want to learn this technique after browsing through it, come to me afterwards. But regardless of whether you decide to learn it or not, you must remember to return this booklet to me.\u201dZhao Dahu carefully handed the booklet over to Lu Sheng.\u201cAlright!\u201d Lu Sheng understood that this likely was Zhao Dahu\u2019s crown jewel.While he handed it over to him so easily, it by no means implied that Lu Sheng could learn the saber technique simply with the booklet alone.Training in martial arts was highly demanding; it required many corrections of the details. It was not something one could learn easily by following some instructions on a booklet.\u201cMany thanks, Uncle Zhao!\u201d Lu Sheng received the booklet with great care.Carrying the Black Tiger Saber Technique booklet, he went straight back to his bedroom and closed the door. Alone, he lit the candles, flipped open the booklet and started reading its contents.Black Tiger Saber Technique \u2013 though it was termed a \u201csaber technique\u201d, it actually contained only a total of three moves.All three were offensive moves.No defensive moves, no evasion techniques\u2026 only offensive moves.The first move \u2013 Tiger Kill.The second move \u2013 Tiger Might.The third move \u2013 Tiger Roar.The moves were simple: they were basically three different saber strokes, each having different strengths and effects.Lu Sheng looked at it briefly and roughly understood it. Simple as those strokes were, their might depended on one\u2019s familiarity with them as well as one\u2019s strength and speed.Strength and speed, in turn, relied on one\u2019s body coordination when employing force.Hence a mantra came along with those three saber strokes as part of the package.The so-called mantra was essentially a guide to thought and mental activity, applied to daily life, which maximized the power of the saber technique. It was basically what people termed as adjusting the mental world.Stroke techniques for adjusting The External, mantra for adjusting The Internal: the two combined to achieve the ultimate integration of one\u2019s mind, body and soul.The Black Tiger Mantra was divided into three levels. There were no special names for the levels; they were simply called Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.Only when one mastered the mantra and became familiar with the external stroke techniques as described in the booklet could one be considered as having achieved full mastery of the saber technique.Lu Sheng closed the booklet lightly and sat by the table in silence for a long while, unceasingly memorizing all the challenging parts of the Black Tiger Saber Technique and revising them over and over again.Then, he called out in his mind. \u201cDeep Blue.\u201dImmediately, the Deep Blue Skills Modifier screen appeared before his eyes.Enclosed within the blue-bordered frame were rows after rows of small boxes. The box in the first row of the first column, at this moment, displayed his present status.Lu Sheng \u2014Martial Arts:Black Tiger Saber Technique: Uninitiated.\u201dThe display was very simple and contained only the Black Tiger Saber Technique that he had just browsed through once.\u2018It really\u2026 it really wasn\u2019t a hallucination!\u2019 Lu Sheng\u2019s body stiffened immediately.Not out of fear, but\u2026 out of excitement!This world was way too dangerous.He was originally content to be a parasite, living without care or worry for the rest of his life. But now it felt like he had just fallen into a snake\u2019s den and became surrounded by many poisonous snakes. If he were to accidentally fall prey to one of them, he would instantly become a minor character in some horror myth \u2013 dead beyond death. [1]\u2018But now, there\u2019s finally a glimmer of hope\u2026 if this modifier really works\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng suppressed the excitement within his heart and began recalling the cheating device\u2019s functions which he had written into its code.The Deep Blue Skills Modifier had only one function, and that was to modify the martial arts skillset of the main character in the game.It could modify the level of one\u2019s martial arts directly into the pinnacle level of complete mastery. But what it could not do was modify one\u2019s level of familiarity with the martial arts, blood volume, strength, speed, inner force\u2026 etc.The only thing it could modify was the level of the martial arts that one was already initiated in.\u2018The only thing I can modify in this box is this Black Tiger Saber Technique. How do I begin the modification?\u2019 Lu Sheng began fiddling around.Alone in his bedroom, his hands were subconsciously flipping through the booklet, but his attention was actually focused on the Deep Blue Skills Modifier in his mind.He scrutinized the modifier, over and over again. Quickly, he discovered a tiny button right at the bottom of the modifier.On it was written: Begin Modification.\u2018This is it.\u2019With a thought, he pressed deeply onto the button, as if with a finger.Immediately, the entire screen flashed, and he suddenly felt that he could control everything in the Modifier at will.It was a miraculous feeling. But rather than dwelling on it, Lu Sheng\u2019s attention quickly focused entirely on the Black Tiger Saber Technique.The status display after the Black Tiger Saber Technique read \u201cUninitiated\u201d. But in that very moment, when he focused his attention on it, its status jumped in a flash. It turned into \u201cInitiated\u201d.Delighted, Lu Sheng eagerly focused his attention on Black Tiger Saber Technique.Very swiftly, the Black Tiger Saber Technique jumped again and turned into Level 1.After that was Level 2, Level 3\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201d Lu Sheng was filled with delight. Looks like the modifier worked indeed.But, just as he was ready to kick back and relax, the Black Tiger Saber Technique jumped again!\u201cLevel 4!!\u201dThe Black Tiger Saber Technique jumped to Level 4 in one sitting!\u201cBoom!\u201dJust as the Black Tiger Saber Technique advanced to Level 4, Lu Sheng felt a loud boom go off in his mind.A splitting headache came upon him and his body began trembling violently as if he was struck by lightning.He collapsed onto the table. After a long period of recovery, he finally lifted his head with difficulty.It felt wet beneath his nose, and he sniffed out a hint of blood\u2019s smell.Lu Sheng lifted his hand and gently rubbed on it. It was dark-red blood.His eyes were unfocused and every single spot all over his body was sore. His body felt devoid of any strength; even standing up took a great deal of effort from him.Lifting his arms, he saw a terrible-looking patch of white on the skin at the back of his palms. He couldn\u2019t keep his eyes open and felt extremely sleepy.\u2018These are symptoms of a serious blood loss!\u2019 Though Lu Sheng did not have medical training, he at least possessed some basic common knowledge\u2026 enough to know that he might be suffering from a serious blood loss.Sitting by the table, he just barely propped himself up and kept the booklet. Then he collapsed onto the bed to rest.\u201cLittle Qiao!\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master? What are your instructions?\u201d Little Qiao asked softly outside the door.\u201cGo\u2026 cook me some red dates porridge and add some ginseng into it. Use an aged one,\u201d Lu Sheng said with great difficulty.That was the good thing about being a rich man\u2019s kid. Average families treated normal ginseng as a life-saver, not to mention aged ginseng. Which family could eat it as a tonic like Lu Sheng was about to do?Little Qiao acknowledged and quickly ran to the kitchen to relay his instructions to the cooks.Lying alone on the bed, Lu Sheng rested for a long while, but his vision remained somewhat dark and he felt devoid of strength in his limbs.Yet, ignoring these sensations, he stretched out his arm and, to his surprise, a practiced muscle memory and intuition that was the result of years of familiarity and practice with saber flooded from his palms into his mind.The three moves of the Black Tiger Saber Technique and the three levels of its mantra had unknowingly become etched indelibly onto his mind.He now thoroughly comprehended the three stroke moves, even the hidden subtleties behind them. Not only that, he also understood inside out how the mantra complemented the different strokes.\u201cIt really worked!?\u201d Lu Sheng closed his eyes, his heart in ecstasy.The experiment had succeeded.Although it had consumed his blood and mental energy, it was worth it in exchange for the full mastery of the Black Tiger Saber Technique.\u2018But, the Black Tiger Saber Technique clearly has only three levels. So where did this fourth level come from?\u2019 That was what baffled Lu Sheng.Moreover, the fourth level of the Black Tiger Saber Technique now felt extremely familiar to him in his mind.It was as if\u2026 as if he created it personally in the first place!The subtle philosophy and ideological underpinnings hidden within it were not something that a person of this world could conjure up, rather, it seemed to be the product of modern scientific theories of force.Although he was just a civil servant, he had at least taken classes on engineering, sports, science and the likes.Before he could continue that line of thought, Little Qiao brought the porridge over.\u201cCoincidentally, some blood-restoring porridge was cooked for Third Young Miss, also with red dates as its main ingredient. But Third Young Miss doesn\u2019t want it, so I brought it over for Young Master. This is Lily Red Dates Broth, good for calming the mind and restoring blood. I\u2019ve also added ginseng into it. Do you want it, Young Master?\u201d Little Qiao asked softly outside the door.\u201cBring it in,\u201d Lu Sheng replied softly.Little Qiao gently pushed open the doors and walked in. But immediately upon entering, she saw the trace of blood on Lu Sheng\u2019s collar.\u201cMas\u2026Mas\u2026Mas\u2026 Young Master, what happened to you!!?\u201d Little Qiao was so shocked she almost spilled the porridge on the floor.Lu Sheng grimaced.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cYou still say you\u2019re fine! You\u2019ve even vomited blood!\u201d Xiao Qiao\u2019s face had turned pale with fright.\u201cI really am fine\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng replied helplessly.Little Qiao hurried to serve Lu Sheng the bowl of porridge in her hands. \u201cCome Young Master, drink some hot porridge first.\u201dWith her assistance, Lu Sheng finished the entire bowl of porridge, one mouthful at a time.Having finished eating, he felt more at ease.He began to recall in detail all of the assorted pieces of information and experience pertaining to the Black Tiger Saber Technique that had suddenly popped up in his mind.Strangely, these were stored in his mind as if they were there right from the beginning. There was no difficulty involved in comprehending them and he felt as if it would be a piece of cake for him to execute them in practice.If not for the current state of his body, he would have searched for a saber in the arena and begun practising.After he had finished the porridge, Little Qiao quickly left for the pharmacy to look for the Lu Manor\u2019s doctor-in-residence. She was still worrying about Lu Sheng\u2019s health.Lu Manor possessed its own exclusive doctor \u2013 a thin elderly man sporting a goatee.Carrying a giant medicinal chest on his back, he hurried over.He sat down beside Lu Sheng\u2019s bed and touched his pulse. After that, his brows unknotted themselves.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much, just a loss of blood. Also, too much mental energy had been expended. He just needs to rest for a few days,\u201d he pulled out a slip of paper and began scribbling a tonic prescription on it.\u201cTake this to the pharmacy, and feed the Young Master with it twice a day for ten days and he\u2019ll fully recover.\u201d\u201cThank you, doctor.\u201dLu Sheng heaved a sigh of relief. It was exactly the same as his own diagnosis.Not long later, Lu Fang aka Lu Quanan also arrived.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d He had come with his second and third mother. [2]Lu Sheng\u2019s own mother had died of sickness a long time ago. It was his second mother who raised him.His second mother Liu Cuiyu was mild-mannered and treated others with great generosity. She raised him like her own child, without any differential treatment between him and her own children.\u201cIt\u2019s just some blood loss from practicing martial arts. It\u2019s nothing,\u201d one by one, Lu Sheng explained to his family members.As the eldest son of the family, he was to inherit the family\u2019s enterprise in the future and become its central pillar. Anything that happened to him would naturally immediately draw other\u2019s concern.[1] ED/N: Literally rice weevil, figuratively sponger, parasite.[2] ED/N: The author literally seems to be saying second and third mothers\u2026 I\u2019d rather use \u201cwives\u201d but it\u2019d sound even more awkward later, so\u2026 Well, taking into account that it\u2019s a different world, I guess it\u2019s okay to allow the author some leeway for differences in common sense there (if it\u2019s intentional, that is\u2026).Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In comparison, this child Lu Sheng\u2019s actions indeed showed much more ambition than the others\u2019 actions. As the chiding words appeared at the tip of his tongue, they turned into a sigh instead.\u201cIf you want to practice martial arts, then you\u2019d better find your Uncle Zhao and learn from him rather than practice blindly by yourself; it can easily lead to mishaps,\u201d he shook his head and turned to walk out of the door. Halfway there, he paused and added,\u201cIf you need any medicine from the pharmacy, just go ahead. I\u2019ll give you two thousand talents each month for your monthly allowance\u2026\u201d He left in big strides after he had finished speaking.Second mother Liu Cuiyu reached out and lightly wiped Lu Sheng\u2019s perspiration off with a towel.\u201cYour father\u2019s quite soft-hearted,\u201d she gave a long sigh.\u201cThe Xu family\u2019s Old Master and he were sworn brothers\u2026 Now that this has happened, he\u2019s feeling very miserable. It\u2019s good for you to practice martial arts. It\u2019s just that, most who do so begin from a young age to establish a solid foundation. At this age now, it is rather late\u2026\u201dShe prattled on and on about other things, but Lu Sheng was entirely unable to hear what she said.His attention was wholly focused on the Black Tiger Saber Technique that he had newly acquired.\u2018It\u2019s really incredible\u2026\u2019Lu Sheng narrowed his eyes a little. On the surface, it seemed like he was listening to his second mother, but in reality he was assessing the state of his body.He flexed his biceps.\u2018The muscles on my arms are the same as they were. Yet, there\u2019s this feeling of familiarity, a strong sense of muscle memory as if I\u2019ve undergone many years\u2019 practice. It\u2019s simply\u2026\u2019He again tried to flex his muscles, this time on his legs.Clearly, the muscles on his legs could exert strength much more easily than previously.He could distinctly feel his strength from both his legs quickly coursing upwards, all the way to his waist and then to both his arms.This fluidity in the flow of strength was described in great detail in the Black Tiger saber Technique.This was called Strength Proficiency.\u2018If it is as the saber Technique says, most people who practice martial arts would have a method to circulate a huge amount of the body\u2019s strength. One is already considered an expert if he is able to mobilize 50% of his total physical strength. To be able to mobilize 80% of one\u2019s strength means to enter the so-called Strength Proficiency realm.\u2019Lu Sheng considered those things in his mind while taking into account the memories originally present in his current body as well as what he had once heard from Uncle Zhao and in conversations with other martial experts regarding the matter.The Strength Proficiency realm was reckoned to be more or less one of the very highest levels achieved by those within Nine Links City.Even for a normal person, to be able to consolidate their strength and focus it into one strike would result in a terrifying speed and strength far surpassing the limits of an ordinary person.\u2018Uncle Zhao is exactly in that Strength Proficiency realm\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng sighed inwardly. The effects of the Modifier were not compromised in the slightest. This thoroughly removed the worry weighing down on his heart.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that the Modifier seems to expend a combination of one\u2019s mental energy, Qi and the sort. Just modifying an ordinary saber technique once has actually almost caused me to lose both qi and blood to the point of being bedridden\u2026 and it\u2019s not even one of those legendary inner force or Qi skills.\u201dLu Sheng was gradually coming to understand the essential nature of the Modifier.It was basically just like an adjustment device that was able to imprint one\u2019s body with experience, memories, instincts and martial arts.However, this sort of adjustment required energy consumption, which apparently occurred at the expense of his mental energy and Qi.Moreover, there was no guarantee of instant success when adjusting one\u2019s body and mind.\u2018The body is like a pile of materials. The Modifier seems to make use of these materials, and establishes a new foundation upon the original base. But it cannot just increase the muscle strength or bone strength from nothing.\u2019 Lu Sheng obtained hypothesized.In the following few days, the changes to his body also confirmed his hypothesis.It began to slowly recover since Day One. At the same time, sturdy muscles gradually formed on his arms, legs, chest and back.Moreover, Lu Sheng felt an obvious change as the pain in his body turned to numbness. On his palms, a thick horny layer steadily appeared. [1]His appetite also grew larger and larger.In order to hide these sudden changes, he would sneak out by himself each day to have extra meals outside.Four meals within the house: three basic meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) plus a midnight snack.Outside, he would still eat the same portions as he did at home.This carried on for seven days. After that, Lu Sheng\u2019s whole body became slightly sturdier, and his stature was no longer as thin and weak as it used to be in the past.As for the saber technique manual, he had long since returned it intact to Uncle Zhao.Having heard how he was ill and bedridden, Uncle Zhao didn\u2019t say anything much. When he received the manual, he merely shook his head and sighed without raising the matter of the saber practice.Lu Sheng guessed that Uncle Zhao probably thought that he had recklessly tried to practice and hurt himself as a result.Indeed, Uncle Zhao\u2019s thoughts were just like that.Initially, he had wanted to wait till Lu Sheng faced difficulties in saber practice before helping him clarify his doubts and clear up any confusion. Who knew that, in the blink of an eye, he would hear that Young Master Lu Sheng would be bedridden from injuries. And then, he had even come to return the secret manual, without mentioning the matter of the Black Tiger Saber Technique again.Thus, he concluded that Lu Sheng was no longer interested and had given up.Regarding this, Uncle Zhao could only sigh and say nothing.Everything returned to as it had been in the past days.The Xu family\u2019s demise seemingly did not have a big influence on life in the Lu Manor.The younger generation continued with their hikes, drank their flower wine, listened to tunes, went horse riding, attended poetry shows and flower exhibitions. Although Nine Links City was not huge, it was not small either; there were plenty of these entertainment establishments.As for the older generation, they occasionally attended this and that gathering and went to the city to participate in yamen\u2019s meetings.Lu Quanan also buried his head in devoting all of his energy to business dealings.It seemed that everyone had already forgotten about the Xu Family\u2019s tragedy. They once again lived the same lives as before.That is, with the exception of two people.One of them was Lu Yiyi. Having lost her fianc\u00e9, her sweetheart, her face was continually bathed in tears. She looked more and more haggard.The other was Lu Sheng. He now liked to venture out a lot more.He didn\u2019t go to enjoy himself by listening to music and dancing, but rather went outside the city to find a clear patch in the small forest nearby.There, he minded his own business and started to attempt practicing the Black Tiger Saber Technique.***Black winds blew among the mountain ridges located along the southwest region of Nine Links City.The sound of wind whistled in the dark night.Lu Sheng was hurrying in their direction, carrying a long-hilted saber he had bought at a blacksmith\u2019s shop.He did not intend to reach Black Winds Ridge; he merely wanted to find an opportunity to test his saber skills.He had obtained the Black Tiger Saber Technique through the Modifier, which he did not intend to divulge. This would be his ultimate trump card.To outsiders, everyone believed him to be an ordinary young master of a wealthy family, too weak to even truss a chicken.Using their prejudice, he could rely on this skill of his to turn the tables on his opponent should he find himself in a dangerous situation.Of course, all this was dependent on the actual usefulness of the Black Tiger Saber Technique in combat.Lu Sheng wasn\u2019t sure where Black Winds Ridge exactly was, or how far it was from Nine Links City.There was no night curfew in Nine Links City; its city gates were open even at night. He changed into a simple and plain clothing and then used ladies\u2019 cosmetic powder to slightly alter his appearance. Alone, he dressed in thick clothes and lowered his head to cover his face.And so, he became just a random tourist whom nobody knew.Borrowing the dark of the night, Lu Sheng left the city, his eyes gazing into the distance.The pitch-black wilderness of the mountains seemed like a huge, hibernating beast, concealed in the silence under the moon.His heart was beating quickly.However, he had to hide himself if he wanted to test out the true power of the Black Tiger Saber Technique.Standing in front of the city gate, he plucked up his courage and walked in the direction of Black Winds Ridge.\u201cDing, Ding, Ding\u2026\u201dA caravan returning in the night was just entering the city from the main road.The wind chimes that hung on the carriages rang out as they swung about in the wind, their sound carrying far into the distance of the night.Lu Sheng exited the city from the side doors.The city gates of Nine Links City were very strange. Not only were they kept open through the night, there was quite a number of them as well. The walls seemed tall and sturdy, but the truth was that there were many cracks in the walls, air seeping through them. It was hardly useful for defense at all.\u201cReturning late at night again today?\u201d\u201cPrecisely\u2026 it\u2019s pitch-dark at night, and the carriage wheels were twisted while rushing back. What bad luck!\u201dThe leader of the caravan and the city guards talked on the main road at the central city gates; the sound of their conversation floated over.Lu Sheng stood on a small road facing southwest. In comparison to the main road, this one was a lot narrower.Only two torches on the city walls lit the black side doors. Dim light emanated from them, lighting up a mere half a meter or so of the way ahead.\u201cThis is indeed the ancient times\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng heaved a sigh in his heart.Looking out, it was pitch-black in all of the three directions ahead. Only Nine Links City at the back offered some light.\u201cNo flashlights or street lights. The wilderness of the ancient times is simply a paradise for the wild predators.\u201dHe hesitated for a slight moment, but experience from the Black Tiger Saber Technique that surged through his body caused his fear to diminish.This was because the Black Tiger Saber Mantra provided a method to deal with such a pitch-black environment.Or rather, the Black Tiger itself was an excellent hunter that could see well in pitch-darkness. The Black Tiger Saber Technique demanded one to be sensitive to the sounds of the wind to determine one\u2019s surroundings, and thus its users did not fear such an environment.Tightening his belt, Lu Sheng grasped the long-hilted saber tightly, walking onto the narrow road towards Black Winds Ridges with haste.About a hundred meters along the narrow road, he withdrew two flints from his waist pouch, and lowered a small torch from his back that he had prepared earlier.With a flint at the head of the torch, he exerted all his might to rub another against it.\u201cPOP!\u201dSparks sputtered out from the head of the torch.The red sparks appeared in a small number, but then spread to the whole head of the torch.There was finally some light in the pitch-darkness.Lu Sheng turned and gazed backwards. The lights from Nine Links City were already very faint.He lifted the torch and proceeded forward slowly.\u2018According to what the hunter said, a wild wolf often roams this stretch of road at night. Well, we\u2019ll see how good my luck is.\u2019He did not dare to really go to Black Winds Ridge. Having learnt that there was a high likelihood that things like ghosts and monsters existed in this world, he naturally did not dare to venture too far away from the city.If it weren\u2019t for the fact that he was still unable to test out the true ability of his skills even after devising various methods while inside the city, he would not have come out here alone to try his luck.After continuing onwards for another stretch of distance, he soon noticed tracks on the ground.Just as the old hunter had said, these were the tracks of a wild wolf.There were also a few pieces of white, clayish egg-shaped feces.Lu Sheng picked up a stone to poke the feces. It was already dried and hardened by the wind. As it broke apart from the poking, something like fingernail parts was revealed from the inside.\u2018It should be this place\u2026 This lump of feces should be from a few days ago. According to the words of the old hunter, he just saw that old wolf here yesterday. It should be somewhere around here.\u2019Lu Sheng held the torch in one hand, while the other unhurriedly drew the long-hilted saber from behind his waist.The long-hilted saber was a type of a saber derived from a combination of a weapon and a farming tool. It had a very long hilt.The hilt and the blade of Lu Sheng\u2019s saber were roughly of the same length. When the blade was removed, it could be used as a pole for farming. It was somewhat similar to a small glaive.It took him quite some strength to wield it with one hand. He might as well stick the torch into the crack of a stone that lay at the side.He was surrounded by messy heaps of stones in weird shapes and sizes. There weren\u2019t any trees around, and thus there was no fear of anything catching fire.Lu Sheng stuck the torch in between the rocks and carefully retrieved a paper bag from his waist pouch. Inside it, there was a slab of fresh pork he had carved out earlier this afternoon.He slowly unfolded the grease paper and lay it onto the ground.There were still traces of blood on the surface of the meat slab. A raw smell of blood soon wafted in the wind, spreading around the area.Lu Sheng lifted his saber and hid himself a short distance away, hunched behind a big rock, waiting.The wind was rather cold.Lu Sheng tilted his body, sticking to the white rock that was slightly taller than a person, and gazed in the direction of the meat slab.Time passed by slowly.\u201cHowl\u2026\u201dSoon, the wind brought with it a faint sound, similar to the wind yet reminiscent of the whimpering of some animal.\u201cHOO!\u201dSuddenly, a black shadow flashed from the side. The light from the torch reflected in and revealed a pair of lush green eyes.The black shadow moved with extreme speed. In a moment, it pounced on the meat slab, held the meat in its mouth, and sped away.Lu Sheng rejoiced, and was about to move.Suddenly, his back tightened as a gust of cold wind blew against it.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes went wide. Lifting the long-hilted saber, he turned around and swung it, delivering a horizontal slash.[1] ED/N: \u201cHorny\u201d as in hard and rough. What did you expect? :3 TL/N: Or rather, \u201cstratum corneum\u201d, the scientific term for the outermost layer of the epidermis. \u201cHorny layer\u201d is the established layman\u2019s term for it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Borrowing the momentum from the huge impact, the long-hilted saber swept away the oncoming black shadow.\u201cBAM!\u201dThe black shadow slammed into the ground, rolled over a few times and emitted a pained growl. The torch cast its light onto it now that it appeared in its range.It was a wild wolf! Its waist had been cut wide open by his saber!Before he could think about it further, two other wild wolves pounced towards him from the dark.His body reacted in the first second by instinct.Tilting the long-hilted saber leftwards, he blocked one of the wild wolves with its long hilt. Then, with a swing of his body, he threw that wolf onto the other beast.\u201cBang!\u201dThese two effortful motions left him wanting in strength. He was but a frail and skinny rich man\u2019s kid not too long ago, after all.The two wild wolves were thrown into the distance, hurt.Panting heavily and red-eyed, Lu Sheng lifted his saber and unleashed a Tiger Kill on the nearest wild wolf!The blade sliced down from above, inclining slightly. His wrists vibrated vigorously \u2013 they shook thrice continuously, as per the rate dictated by the mantra.\u201cWhoosh!\u201dThe roar of a fierce tiger seemed to ring in the air.Struck with fear, the two wild wolves trembled and their movements lapsed by a beat.At that instant, light flashed across the blade of the long-hilted saber. One of the beasts was beheaded on the spot with a clean saber stroke.The tip of the saber had also nicked the other wolf\u2019s neck, and blood was rapidly seeping out of it.Lu Sheng mustered up his strength and struck again. This time, it was Tiger Might.His forearm vibrated four times, employing a different level of force each time. The strength of his entire body was channeled into the saber.Tiger Might emphasized speed more than Tiger Kill did, compromising slightly on strength in return. Nonetheless, it wasn\u2019t something the fragile neck of a mere wild wolf could withstand.Before the wolf could dodge, it was struck squarely in the neck by the long-hilted saber that sped up drastically without warning.\u201cSplat!\u201dThe wolf\u2019s head fell on the ground.Lu Sheng sucked in huge mouthfuls of air, panting heavily.The continuous series of big movements had left a layer of sweat on his face.\u201cHOWL\u2026\u201dOne more wild wolf remained \u2013 the one which went for the meat.Now, it went around a rock, its two green eyes staring furiously at Lu Sheng.\u2018My body\u2019s too weak after all\u2026\u2019 Frustration gathered in Lu Sheng\u2019s heart.However, his face remained impassive. He understood that when facing off against a wild beast, one must never back off or show even a hint of fear.\u201cEh!?\u201dBoth his eyes opened wide in a stare as he glared fiercely at the wolf.The last wild wolf focused its stare on him for a moment longer before slowly retreating backwards. Finally, it completely slipped into the darkness.Only then did Lu Sheng breathe in relief.Actually, his stamina was almost completely spent. Both his arms were sore and weak, even to the point of trembling when grasping his saber.If that wild wolf had really pounced on him\u2026 while he was certain that he would survive, he wouldn\u2019t remain unscathed either.He waited till he was sure that the wild wolf had really left. Then, Lu Sheng retrieved the torch and left hurriedly in the direction of Nine Links City.With this trip, he now knew where he stood.Uncle Zhao had once mentioned his glorious past in connection with the wild wolves outside the city.After achieving full mastery of his saberplay in his youth, he had once been surrounded and attacked by three wild wolves. Armed with nothing but a single-handed saber, he slaughtered all three wolves at the cost of a mild injury to his forearm.This had already set a terrific battle score.The wild wolves in this world were completely different from those that Lu Sheng knew.Their bodies were larger \u2013 each one much larger than the wild wolves on Earth. They were much stronger as well.Almost the same as the big golden retrievers people kept as pets. [1]Another difference between wild wolves here and on Earth was that those here gathered in packs of three to five. Very rarely would there be large packs of them.Lu Sheng jogged back to the city gates. When the light of the torches on the city walls came into view, he felt a sense of relief.Rolling up the clothes on him, he hid the blood-stained spots and his long-hilted sabre, took out his travel pass, and strode towards the city gates.***\u201cBrother Sheng, Brother Sheng, listen to me! This ain\u2019t ordinary stuff. Right after reaching Zi Hua City, I had people bring it here from over there.Rumor has it that in the Central Plains it is considered the Number One Legendary Stone. Countless merchants and nobles bid and fought for it. Finally, in an accident, it fell into the river and the waves brought it to Zi Hua River. Then it was fished out of the waters by the fishermen of Zi Hua City.I can\u2019t tell you the twists and turns of this story in just a few words. If not for\u2026\u201d\u201cDo I look like a fool to you?\u201d Lu Sheng gently waved his fan and looked at a fatso before him with a faint smile.This fatso was called Zheng Xiangui. He was the second son of the boss of the Precious &amp; Famous Auction House in Nine Links City.As well as Lu Sheng\u2019s best friend from his past.Lu Sheng and he grew up as brothers from another mother. They clicked impeccably with each other and went through all troubles together, sharing thick and thin. [2]It\u2019s just that Zheng Xiangui had a bad habit. It was his tendency to wallow in greed.In his own words, he would say that even biological brothers had to keep clear scores, otherwise their relationship would sour sooner or later.Both of them were sitting in Goldfish Restaurant\u2019s Peony Room. A well-endowed lady dressed in pink sat beside the fatso, reclining in his arms.This lad was now staring at Lu Sheng with a pained expression.\u201cBrother Sheng, now that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. Your brother here took great pains to find a rare treasure. And now here he is, giving you the opportunity to bid for it in private before it gets auctioned. It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t value it, but how can you ridicule me?\u201d Fatso pointed at Lu Sheng, looking as if he was immensely grieved.\u201cAlright, alright. Don\u2019t pull that trick on me. Have you gotten news about the martial arts manuals I\u2019m looking for?\u201d Lu Sheng continued to ask.He came looking for this blood brother of his in order to gather more martial arts manuals.One Black Tiger Saber Technique was not enough. Not even close.He finally understood the chances of survival out in the wild an expert like Uncle Zhao had.No wonder he had never heard of anyone journeying out in the distance alone. Out in the wilderness, wild beasts were abundant. For anyone to venture out all by himself was to court death.Even Uncle Zhao, Zhao Dahu, famous in Nine Links City, was able to deal with just three wild wolves on his own. Maybe four, at the very most. Any more and even the Nine Links City\u2019s supposedly top-notch expert would have to surrender.\u201cWith stuff like martial arts manuals, it\u2019s hard to tell genuine apart from fake. Not only that, many of them have hidden snares within them. Even if they were genuine, some of the methods written inside will lead to lifelong handicaps if you make even a small mistake and practice them for long. What do you want this for, Brother Sheng? Without a master to guide you, there\u2019s no use no matter how many manuals you buy,\u201d Zheng Xiangui asked out of curiosity, rubbing his white jade thumb ring.\u201cYou\u2019re quite in-the-know.\u201d Lu Sheng chuckled. \u201cI naturally have my uses for them. Don\u2019t bother yourself with that, just find me a few to begin with.\u201dZheng Xiangui shrugged. \u201cWell, I guess there are a few. Two martial arts manuals were deposited for sale by a client just recently. We\u2019ve gotten a master to examine them. They should be genuine. But without a master, nobody dares to practice them.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the asking price?\u201d Lu Sheng asked straightforwardly.\u201cHey hey, Brother Sheng, with this special relationship going on between the two of us, why act so polite?\u201d Zheng Xiangui started giggling like a woman.\u201cCan you stop being so disgusting?\u201d Lu Sheng was speechless. \u201cName a price, come on, I\u2019m in a hurry.\u201d\u201cI can only sell you one. The other one has been reserved by another VIP,\u201d Zheng Xiangui said with a smile.\u201cOne will do. Did you bring it?\u201d Lu Sheng raised his eyes.\u201cBrother Sheng understands me well after all. Seeing how you were going after it, I directly brought it over,\u201d Zheng Xiangui took out a thin grey booklet.\u201cThis manual doesn\u2019t have any moves. It\u2019s simply a special strength technique. One price, a hundred talents!\u201d\u201cLet me take a look first,\u201d Lu Sheng stretched out his hand.A hundred talents was equivalent to ten thousand dollars. This fatso also really dared to ask.Fatso chuckled and placed the booklet in his hand. Taking the manual over, Lu Sheng flipped through it and read in detail.This manual seemed like it was part of a larger book from which it was ripped. It so happened to contain some content on strength.Looking at its contents, the cultivated strength was termed Jade Force.According to the manual, full mastery of the skill allowed one to begin accumulating force from all over the body right from the very first move. The accumulated force, once completed, could raise one\u2019s striking speed and strength explosively by a great margin.Lu Sheng looked at it. Its technique didn\u2019t seem to overlap with the Black Tiger Saber Mantra and so could be stacked with it.But he was not looking for this.He was looking for those inner force Qi skills \u2013 manuals which could strengthen his physique and mind.From the pathetic state he landed himself in after using the Modifier once, he could tell that he needed to improve his physique in order to reduce the aftereffects of using the Modifier.\u201cDo you have those legendary inner force Qi manuals?\u201d\u201cInner force Qi manuals?\u201d Zheng Xiangui rubbed his chin.\u201cBrother Sheng, you got me in a fix now. If there really was such stuff in the market, not to mention whether they\u2019re real or fake, they\u2019d be snatched up in the blink of an eye.\u201d\u201cYou yourself said that it\u2019s hard to distinguish real from fake. You should have copies of such in your family warehouse, right?\u201dLu Sheng, too, was in-the-know. A business like an auction house would certainly make a copy of the manuals they release for auction to keep as surviving copies.Having run an auction house for so many years, the Zheng family must have had accumulated more than a few such copies.\u201cOh, those\u2026 Brother Sheng. Even I cannot guarantee that there\u2019s any one genuine among them.If only one in a hundred is real, we\u2019ll be lucky. Until today, no one has been able to cultivate any Qi from them. You sure you want them?\u201d Zheng Xiangui hesitated. \u201cAs your brother, I\u2019ll give you a piece of advice: don\u2019t play with those surviving copies. If anything goes awry, you\u2019ll damage your body and there are no means to fix that.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got a way to find them?\u201dLu Sheng raised his brows. Fatso\u2019s expression was a familiar one to him. Each time he displayed such an expression, it meant that he did know an answer, but was hesitating whether or not he should say it.\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got a way\u2026 Brother Sheng, the kind of a manual you want\u2026 there indeed is one like that in this upcoming auction,\u201d an awkward expression appeared on Zheng Xiangui\u2019s face.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so earlier?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s brows twitched.\u201cIt\u2019s not that your brother didn\u2019t want to say. It\u2019s that this stuff is going to be placed on auction in the Black Meeting\u2026\u201d\u201cBlack Meeting?\u201d Lu Sheng understood instantly.A Black Meeting was an anonymous auction during which clients hid their faces and names. The items brought out for auction were also often \u201cunclean\u201d; more than one of them was something blood was spilt over as well.Those who liked to attend the Black Meeting were mostly those who lived on the edge and were dangerous gangsters.\u201cCan you arrange for me to attend?\u201d Lu Sheng, however, had made up his mind to attend.No average gangster would dare to provoke the Lu Manor anyway.Just counting strong housemen, the Lu family had thirty or forty of them. Not to mention several experts like Uncle Zhao among the ranks of its estate guards.Old Master Lu Quanan also possessed inseparable connections with the yamen authorities and could expect the help of the army when he encountered trouble.With a powerful family background like that, he really needed not fear any ordinary gangsters.[1] ED/N: The only Chinese subspecies of wolves that would barely fit the bill is the Mongolian wolf, being roughly the same or barely smaller compared to golden retrievers (unless there\u2019s something I missed). Most other wolves like the Tibetan wolf or the wolves in the West are much bigger. Maybe the author meant St. Bernard or a similar dog breed? It is indeed bigger than any Eurasian wolf subspecies I know of.[2] ED/N: Brothers from different mothers is an idiom, meaning that they were as close as brothers.

But\u2026\u201dFatso was put on a spot. \u2018What kind of people attend the Black Meeting? Murderers, robbers, burglars, thieves, people with shady backgrounds! If Brother Sheng accidentally got embroiled in a conflict and got hurt, that\u2019d be really unfortunate.\u2019\u201cBut I better keep a low profile, right?\u201d Lu Sheng smiled. He understood his concern.He was representing not merely himself, but also Nine Links City\u2019s Lu family. Once any mishap happened to him, the Lu Manor would settle scores with Zheng Xiangui for sure.\u201cIt\u2019s best that you understand it. Brother Sheng, your identity isn\u2019t like anyone else\u2019s. If it were anyone else, I wouldn\u2019t be so worried\u2026\u201d Zheng Xiangui sighed.\u201cI got it. Just make the arrangements. I must lay my hands on that thing,\u201d Lu Sheng insisted.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d Zheng Xiangui sighed helplessly as he complied.Lu Sheng confirmed the starting time of the Black Meeting with him carefully. Then, he waited while Zheng Xiangui instructed someone to bring over a VIP invitation.With the invitation in hand, he finally left the restaurant.\u201cHigh-grade cosmetic powder! Ladies, come and take a look!\u201d\u201cHigh quality first-grade products from the Central Plains, just imported from Zi Hua City!\u201d\u201cBlusher that\u2019s exclusively from Purple Sun &amp; Floral Scent. You can\u2019t find it anywhere else!\u201dOn the streets outside the restaurant, hawkers pushed their wooden carts laden with cosmetic powders, inching along the sides of the streets.Lu Sheng\u2019s glance swept over them. The street in front of him specialized in selling cosmetic products. Many women and ladies loved to shop here.A light rain had just fallen on the street, leaving a wet layer on it. The rays of the setting sun reflected off them, dyeing the entire street into a faint red hue.Lu Sheng breathed out. The moment his breath left his mouth, it condensed into white mist which dispersed gradually.He turned back to look at the restaurant. The Goldfish Restaurant cast a giant shadow under the sun.This was the largest restaurant in Nine Links City and it happened to be its peak hours. Customers streamed in and out of the restaurant incessantly, creating an unusual commotion and din.Standing in the shadow of the restaurant, Lu Sheng looked towards both its sides.Other places were rather neglected.Hawkers inched along, pushing their carts with cosmetic goods, moving without stopping in the shade.As Lu Sheng watched on, he thought of buying some gifts for second mother and Yiyi. These cosmetic powders weren\u2019t expensive, and sometimes one could find quality goods that\u2019d serve as fine gifts.He strolled along the streets, trying to pick a good hawker.As the afternoon went on, the streets grew increasingly deserted and many shops closed for the day.The number of people on both sides of the street shrank to just a few. Lu Sheng met them only occasionally.The strange thing was that these hawkers selling cosmetic goods could clearly see that there weren\u2019t many people around them, and yet they still smiled and hawked their goods with great effort.Hawking yells rose and fell here and there, reverberating across the big empty street.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes narrowed, but didn\u2019t think that anything was amiss. \u2018Perhaps this is a custom or phenomenon unique to this world.\u2019Glancing from left to right, he finally picked a hawker pushing a cart painted in light red. A pole was attached to the cart, and a flag on it that read: \u201cCentral Plains\u2019 Li\u2019s Cosmetic Goods\u201d.The hawker moved along slowly, pushing his cart, with a big smile on his face. He was clad in a grey linen robe and a greyish white melon peel cap.\u2018I think Li\u2019s Cosmetic Goods is quite an established business from the Central Plains.\u2019Lu Sheng recalled from his memory and slowly headed towards the hawker, intending to pick some quality cosmetic powder for second mother and Yiyi.The hawker gradually moved forward. Near him, a few kids were having fun, chasing each other and playing.The cart went past the children, then turned into a small alley in the shadows.Lu Sheng guessed that the hawker was probably about to call it a day. So, he hastened his steps, going after him.\u201cAi! Brother Sheng!\u201dSuddenly, a voice called from behind him. It was a pretty familiar voice, as if from someone he knew.Lu Sheng turned around to see a tanned, muscular scholar walk towards him in big strides.\u201cLuo Sheng?\u201d [1]He hesitated for a moment before recognizing him.Luo Sheng, aka Luo Junyi, was a classic rich young master in Nine Links City, just like Lu Sheng. But, unlike others, this lad possessed an actual academic degree; he had just passed the prefectural level exam recently and became a xiucai. News was that he had quite the literary flair. [2]Actually, Luo Junyi had a very ordinary friendship with him. It just so happened that his name coincided with that of a Mount Liang hero, hence Lu Sheng remembered his name after hearing it once.\u201cBrother Sheng, it\u2019s an emergency, an emergency!\u201d Loo Junyi took two steps towards him, red-faced.Lu Sheng immediately understood why this dude came looking for him. Although he was a young master of a rich family, he extremely loved gambling and often gambled to his last penny, winding up borrowing money from all over the place.It looked like he had depleted his gambling capital again.Lu Sheng laughed as he took out ten talents of silver from his waist pouch and handed them over.\u201cHow\u2019s your luck today?\u201d\u201cAcceptable, acceptable, hahaha\u2026 I knew I could count on Brother Sheng,\u201d Luo Junyi took the silver and left hurriedly.Lu Sheng shook his head. The money was a small matter. Lu family\u2019s business and estate was enormous after all. Somebody would come handing over money just around the corner.He turned to find the hawker selling cosmetic goods again.The hawker\u2019s cart had already entered the alley, leaving only a small half of it outside.With great strides, he swiftly walked over and followed it into the alley.\u201cEh??\u201dLu Sheng froze in his tracks. This was an alley with a dead end!The alley was empty, without a hawker, a cart or any living soul to be found.His eyes both narrowed to a slit and his body became poised and alert.From beginning to end, left to right, he carefully examined this blind alley.It was an alley over ten meters long, formed by the greyish black walls of the houses on both sides. At its end, it was blocked by an aged black wall, with a few seals glued across it.The seals of made of white paper and red letters looked dark under the sunset. Their corners flew up, having lost their adhesiveness.\u201cNo trapdoors on the walls\u2026 where could the cart have gone\u2026?\u201dLu Sheng kept searching his memory. He clearly remembered that the cart had entered this alley between the houses.He backed out of it and saw the few children who were still playing and chasing one another. These kids wore simple clothes and seemed to come from ordinary families.Lu Sheng plastered on a smiley face and fished out a few bronze coins from his pocket. He caught a little girl who was giving chase.\u201cLittle girl, can I ask you something?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to ask, brother? Please ask.\u201dThe little girl sported two ponytails and was nine or ten years-old, her cheeks red and puffy. Perhaps because she was used to playing on the streets, she was unafraid of strangers and replied straightforwardly.\u201cBrother would like to ask \u2013 did you see that Li\u2019s Cosmetic Goods cart pass by here just now? Did it enter this alley here?\u201dLu Sheng stuffed two bronze coins into the little girl\u2019s palms. A radiant smile immediately broke out on the little girl\u2019s face.\u201cI didn\u2019t see any cosmetic goods cart, did I? We play here every day. The cosmetic goods carts usually come only in the morning. In the afternoon, they all go over to the antique street.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t see it?\u201d Lu Sheng was stunned. He felt that the kid was lying.But then he saw the earnest expression on the little girl\u2019s wide-eyed face.\u201cWhat I said is true. There really weren\u2019t any carts on the streets today. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can go ask others. There\u2019s nothing at all on the streets,\u201d the rest of the children ran over and voiced their assent.\u201cYea yea. My mum was even gonna come over to get some stuff, but not even one cart could be seen. It\u2019s really strange.\u201d\u201cThis brother says he just saw a Li\u2019s Cosmetic Goods,\u201d the little girl pointed at Lu Sheng.\u201cWhere? Where?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see it. That\u2019s all that there is to this street.\u201d\u201cBrother probably saw it in his dreams? Heeheehee\u2026\u201dThe group of lads broke out in laughter and din again.The smile on Lu Sheng\u2019s face gradually vanished. He turned his head to look at the Goldfish Restaurant.The restaurant under the shadow was crowded with business. Its extraordinary liveliness of was in stark contrast to the desertedness of the streets here.\u201cIn that case, did you all see\u2026\u201dLu Sheng turned back and his voice froze.The kids around him had all disappeared god-knows-when. All around him, the street was deserted, empty and devoid of anything.Without so much as a single passer-by.The commotion and din of the children had vanished. Logically speaking, it was impossible for children of that age to all instantly disappear without a sound like that.Lu Sheng was confident in himself. He was, after all, trained in the Black Tiger Saber and could even detect the position of wild wolves just by listening to the wind. And yet, he did not even hear the sound of the children leaving.Staring at the desolate and deathly street, a chill went down his spine. He quickly walked towards the Goldfish Restaurant.\u201cPitter, patter\u2026\u201dThe sounds of his footsteps rang clearer than usual. The more he approached the restaurant, the more he felt a warm sensation on his entire body.Whoosh!!All of a sudden, as if he had just broken through the water surface, Lu Sheng felt everything come to life around him, brimming with life and energy.One by one, warm-bodied customers passed by beside him. One of them accidentally knocked into him and hurried to apologize.Ladies were alighting from horse carriages, smiling as they walked slowly into the restaurant and were led in by waiters.Standing before the restaurant, Lu Sheng looked back on the street selling cosmetic goods again. Without knowing when, it was now filled with some passers-by who weren\u2019t there previously.It was worlds apart from the desertedness before.Lu Sheng sucked in a mouthful of cold air and swiftly hailed a horse carriage.\u201cTo the Lu Manor!\u201d\u201cAlrighty, please sit tight!\u201dWith a whip from the carriage driver, a skinny old horse slowly moved its hooves.Seated on the carriage, Lu Sheng\u2019s mind was occupied by what he had encountered.The hawker, the group of children\u2026 they were all very abnormal.\u2018Thinking about it now, the smile on the hawker\u2019s face didn\u2019t move a single inch. It felt extremely fake.\u2019His thoughts led towards the terrible Xu family case and, suddenly, the sense of an impending disaster washed over him.\u201cThis city is really getting more and more dangerous\u2026\u201d he mumbled.The horse carriage pulled up shortly outside the Lu Manor gates. Upon seeing Lu Sheng in the carriage, the gatekeeper hurried over.\u201cYoung Master, you\u2019ve returned?\u201dThe gatekeeper was surnamed Wang and was the eighth oldest among his siblings. Everybody usually called him Little Eight. He was a smart lad and had only turned seventeen this year. He inherited his father\u2019s job as the gatekeeper of Lu Manor.Little Eight was pretty familiar with Lu Sheng and would often recount the strange rumors and hearsay flying around in and out of the city to him.Those were also what Lu Sheng loved to hear.\u201cIs the Old Master in?\u201d Lu Sheng asked casually after alighting and paying.\u201cOld Master went to the yamen again. The Prefect summoned him. To find something, it seems,\u201d Little Eight smiled.\u201cFind something?\u201dLu Sheng had been busy with his own matters the past few days and neglected the happenings at home.\u201cWhat thing?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Kurisu\u201cNot sure about that. Yesterday, Old Master called all heads of the businesses here, both minor and major, for a meeting. As they were leaving, I heard them say that everyone will have to help find it together. I wonder what it is, to go so far as to call all those big shots to help,\u201d Little Eight smiled as he thought about the matter.Lu Sheng said nothing in response. However, he put on a rather gloomy expression. He walked past the main door to enter inside. As he walked, he asked him another question. \u201cHas anything strange happened lately?\u201d\u201cEr\u2026 Young Master, although Little Eight is considered well-informed, how can strange things happen everyday?\u201d Little Eight shrugged his shoulders helplessly. [1]\u201cAlthough\u2026 I heard that there was a big fire that broke out last night at the Goldfish Restaurant that you frequent. Half the side street was burnt away! Even though we servants were a long way off, we could still see the flames very distinctly from far away.\u201d\u201cA big fire\u2026\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s heart sank. He had a faint guess.\u201cAre you talking about that street that often sells cosmetic powders during the day?\u201d\u201cPrecisely, just that!\u201d Little Eight nodded vigorously, \u201cI hear that quite a number of people died. Some of them were entire families, including the young and the old. It\u2019s really awful\u2026 I wonder which heartless creature set the fire!\u201d\u2018A big fire\u2026\u2019Lu Sheng said nothing more. He suppressed the matter deep within his heart and stopped thinking about it.The Black Meeting was arranged to be at night in three days\u2019 time, in a cellar outside the city.In these three days, Lu Sheng rested and ate each day as usual. He could clearly feel his body growing sturdier, as if the Black Tiger Saber altered by the Modifier had also improved his physical state itself.In those three days, he paid the street near Goldfish Restaurant a visit yet again. Sure enough, it was all charred and burnt. Quite a few people could be even seen being busy at rebuilding new houses.Lu Sheng walked back along the road that he had gone before. It was exactly the same as he had seen the other day.Even that dead end of a back alley was just as it had been.He now had a few guesses in mind, but did not feel fearful or anxious.Since there were water ghosts in this world, then naturally, other things could also exist.He had initially intended to get initiated in that Jade Force on the ripped manual which he had bought during these three days, and then to modify it. However, as he thought of the Black Meeting, he decided to hold back for now. If he injured himself badly and spat out blood after modification again, he would lose this opportunity.Time passed by quickly. In the blink of an eye, it was the day of the appointment.It was around seven or eight at night.Lu Sheng changed into a set of black robes and put on the mask of a tiger. It was a toy for children that he had casually bought off the streets, and was very crudely made.In front of the Lu Manor entrance, the Zheng Family\u2019s horse carriage was already waiting.He hurriedly boarded the horse carriage. Zheng Xiangui was currently sitting inside, biting off big chunks of meat from the braised chicken thigh he held in both his hands.This fatso also wore a set of black robes. However, it didn\u2019t really matter \u2013 anyone could tell from his exaggerated physique that this guy was the Young Master of the faction hosting the Black Meeting.\u201cGood, you\u2019re here, we\u2019re just waiting for you. Brother Sheng, hurry, get on the carriage.\u201dBoth men sat down and the horse carriage slowly began to move.Zheng Xiangui advised Lu Sheng throughout the journey on the dos and don\u2019ts after entry, a whole host of messy details to pay attention to. Still, Lu Sheng committed each of them to his memory.Soon, they left the city. They travelled along a main road, from which they took a twist into a side road, then meandered along for quite a distance before heading directly into the outskirts.After travelling along the outskirts for a while, the horse carriage approached a little village tucked away in an overgrown wilderness area. It stopped in front of a stone house in the middle of the village.\u201cThis is it,\u201d Zheng Xiangui jumped off the carriage. A black-robed man standing guard at the door of the stone house came forward and greeted him.\u201cEverybody\u2019s present?\u201d\u201cEverybody\u2019s present. The first auction item is already being displayed.\u201dZheng Xiangui nodded, anxiously urging, \u201cLet\u2019s hurry inside, it\u2019s already started.\u201dHe pulled Lu Sheng into the stone house. He opened a wooden door on the floor in the middle of the stone house, revealing a flight of stairs that led underground.Lu Sheng followed behind Zheng Xiangui and two other guards down the stairs. At the bottom was a karst cave with a rather large surface area.The karst cave was even prepared rather decently.There was a big hall in the middle. In the surrounding stone walls was a circle of side rooms, each of them looking like little packets hanging on the walls.A few people were seated sparsely in the big hall. No firelight came from the surrounding little packets; clearly, they were not in use.\u201cWow, this place has a rather huge layout,\u201d Lu Sheng exclaimed.\u201cHehe, we discovered this place accidentally,\u201d the fatso said laughingly. He brought Lu Sheng in from the back of the big hall, and headed for the seats in the front row.Only a little more than ten people in total attended the Black Meeting this time. They all sat scattered around the first row.A tall, skinny man whose face was veiled was standing on the stage. Currently, he was introducing the details of the item being auctioned in a loud voice.Next to him stood two dwarves. Both of them wore bright garish floral garments and held a bronze plate in their hands between them. There was a dagger on the plate, brown and spotty from rust.\u201cAn ancient dagger passed down from Ju Rong Nation, most likely forged by Duan Fengzi of the olden days! There are some words carved on it in the national language of Ju Rong Nation, even if\u2026 aye! Guest No. Four bids one thousand talents! Any higher bids? Any higher bids!?\u201d The man on the stage yelled loudly with an extremely animated expression.Lu Sheng and Zheng Xiangui sat on the seats to the left.The rows of seats here all seemed to be carved out of white stone. It was extremely cold to the touch, emitting completely no warmth.Fatso sat right next to him. He cocked his head and whispered, \u201cWhat you want is the fifth item, the second to last one.\u201dLu Sheng nodded his head wordlessly.Clearly, the dagger on the stage had just been dug up from the ground not too long ago. It was perhaps found by a grave robber.There were still quite a few people competing for it below. In just a short while, the bid for the dagger had risen to one thousand eight hundred talents.Lu Sheng\u2019s heart beat quickly as he listened to the proceedings. This was already twice the equivalent of his monthly allowance!He did not watch the bidding competition on stage any longer. Instead, he diverted his attention to focus on the guests who were near him.Most of the guests to the Black Meeting carried with them weapons, ranging from short to long in size. Moreover, most of them were dressed in black and disguised, though there were also exceptions.Of the more than ten guests who were present, there were three who did not conceal their identity.One of them was a man with red hair who wore a fitting yellow leather armor and carried a broadsword on his back.Another was a very short, skinny and seemingly weak youth who had a beak-like mouth and sunken cheeks. Tied to his waist were two bulging black leather pouches that carried god-knew-what.The third one was the most eye-catching.Or rather, it was a pair. A man and a woman.The man\u2019s clothes and a sword he carried on his waist conveyed a sense of strength; he seemed to be a bodyguard. He held an indifferent look that only softened for a bit when he gazed upon the woman.The woman wore a black dress that was not one of the typical long dresses that women in ancient times wore. It was a tight dress whose hem and its surroundings looked like a body-hugging miniskirt that one would see on Earth.From head to toe, there was only that one piece body-hugging dress which barely covered her rear. Just a slightly bigger movement of lifting her legs would clearly reveal the space between her two legs.This woman dressed sexily. She had long legs and a slender waist; a pair of white weapons at her chest threatened to tear the dress apart, looking as if at any moment the dress would burst at the seams near the chest area.Lu Sheng could not help but look at the woman\u2019s face.She had a very high nose bridge and a pair of charming and glittering eyes that seemed to always be smiling. Her long black hair fell on her shoulders, so smooth and shining that they seemed to reflect a bit of light.\u2018This is so much more effective than any so-called Photoshop makeup technique,\u2019 Lu Sheng praised in his heart.One could tell that this woman was someone influential with a mere glance. Only one who was absolutely confident in one\u2019s strength would dare to show such a beautiful face so freely at the Black Meeting.\u201cThat\u2019s Duan Muwan,\u201d seeing Lu Sheng\u2019s attention had been attracted by the woman, Fatso promptly leaned in to whisper the introduction. \u201cBut I don\u2019t recommend you trying to pick her up. This woman is beyond fierce!\u201d\u201cFierce? How so?\u201dLu Sheng was mildly curious, but he did not have any designs on her. It was just that the woman was simply too eye-catching, so he was sizing her up.Fatty smiled a little and looked towards the stage, at the second auction item that had already appeared.\u201cDuan Muwan came to Nine Links City about two months ago. I heard that she came along with a merchant group. The two of them, master and servant, joined the group by themselves. To walk such a long distance in itself is already not easy.\u201d\u201cIndeed, it\u2019s no easy feat,\u201d Lu Sheng nodded.\u201cMoreover, because of her natural beauty, this woman has been very promiscuous since coming to Nine Links City. Quite a number of handsome young masters have been seduced by her and then, guess what happened?\u201d Fatso shook his head and sighed.\u201cWhat?\u201d Lu Sheng asked, his curiosity now piqued.\u201cAll the young masters were infatuated beyond reason, resulting in a massive melee, which resulted in quite a number of injured and even quite a few killed,\u201d fatso said as he clicked his tongue.\u201cEven so, those who were seriously injured and handicapped remain devoted to this woman. But she\u2019s already forgotten them in the blink of an eye!\u201dLu Sheng narrowed his eyes, a shiver in his heart. He had heard of these incidents, but never imagined that this woman was the cause of them all. For them to pine for her even after they were handicapped\u2026 this was not something that could be explained by her beauty.In that moment, he labeled Duan Muwan as extremely dangerous in his mind. For her to be able to twist so many people around her little finger, she either had extremely high EQ or employed some unusual methods. It was best to stay as far away as possible from such characters.He refocused his attention on the auction on the stage.It was already the fourth auction item\u2019s turn now: a yellow-bronze half-body leather armor.\u201cThis leather armor is the Ice Wolf Armor, made of the combined, tanned hide of nineteen white wolves of the Ice White Grasslands. Nineteen layers of wolf hide are now as thin as a copper coin after tanning. Its resistance against both blunt tools and swords far exceeds that of a normal leather armor. It\u2019s almost the same as wearing another layer of chainmail armor!\u201d The black-robed man exclaimed loudly to introduce this piece of leather armor.\u201cStarting bid price is two hundred talents!\u201dSilence. No one moved.The host didn\u2019t seem to mind it very much. He got one of the dwarves to hold the leather armor before personally taking out a dagger and violently piercing into its side.\u201cThud!\u201dA muffled sound rang out as the dagger slid off. Surprisingly, only a small scratch remained on the leather armor.\u201cThree hundred talents!\u201d Seeing that, someone immediately placed a bid.\u201cFour hundred talents!\u201d\u201cSix hundred talents!\u201dThe bids continued to rise higher and higher. Lu Sheng himself was rather moved when he saw it. This sort of leather armor was both lightweight and nimble, and was more convenient and flexible than the metal armor as it did not affect one\u2019s movements. If its defense was really as strong as stated, then it indeed was a valuable item.He wanted to state a price, but seeing that the bids arrived at almost one thousand talents in the blink of an eye, he could only restrain himself and give it up. His true goal was still the next item: the manual.He could not lose sight of the big picture for this small item.In the end, the leather armor was bought by the red-haired man with the broadsword on his back. Shortly afterwards, the second last item was up.The inner force secret manual.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Kurisu\u201cNext up is an inner force secret manual that we\u2019re all familiar with through the legends. Of course, with regards to its authenticity, we remain unsure despite our examination. After all, stuff like inner force takes a long time to practice and evaluate. We can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s genuine or fake in the short term. But, from our examination of the book\u2019s material, we can confirm that the fabric used has exceeded one hundred years in age!\u201dThe host chuckled twice as he saw that he had succeeded in rousing the audience. All lines of sight zoomed in on him.Then he continued slowly. \u201cThis secret manual\u2019s name is Black Fury Skill.\u201dLifting a yellow-bronze plate, the two dwarves slowly sauntered up the stage. On the plate, there was a pitch-black booklet made of silk cloth.\u201cThis Black Fury Skill has thirty-two levels in total. According to the records in it, every rise in level will be accompanied with a tempering of one\u2019s body. The manual here contains levels one to five.\u201d\u201cTsk, turns out it\u2019s incomplete,\u201d someone among the audience immediately voiced their dissatisfaction.\u201cInner Qi is already tough enough to train in to begin with\u2026 it\u2019s so iffy and nebulous. And now, your secret manual isn\u2019t even complete? Who would dare to use it? If somebody had modified any parts of it, to practice it would mean to court death!\u201d Another mocked.\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to buy it,\u201d yet another scorned.\u201cEveryone, please be silent,\u201d the host said with a smile, lowering both his arms. \u201cThis Black Fury Skill manual was actually deposited with us for auction by a client. Actually, this client had also verified with us the authenticity of a portion of it. Let\u2019s not talk about the rest. At least the first three levels can definitely be practiced.\u201dHe thought that those words would certainly impress and rouse the audience. However, nobody changed their attitude.Lu Sheng shook his head slightly; he understood why this was so. Zheng Xiangui, however, was puzzled.\u201cBrother Sheng, what happened? There\u2019s something wrong with this response, isn\u2019t there?\u201d\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong, this is very normal,\u201d Lu Sheng replied flatly. \u201cInner force manuals take years to practice\u2026 It\u2019s really too long. Regardless of whether or not there\u2019s somebody to demonstrate it, no one dares to put his or her stakes on it.\u201d\u201cMoreover, I\u2019ve heard Uncle Zhao mention that inner force isn\u2019t as powerful as the legends have it. Unless one practices it to the pinnacle level, its force sometimes even loses to that of a strike by an outer force expert at full strength.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2019s that so?\u201d Zheng Xiangui was even more puzzled now.\u201cPerhaps Young Master isn\u2019t well acquainted with this area,\u201d spoke a captain of the guard standing behind them at that moment.His name was Chen Dewu, one of the Zheng family\u2019s guard\u2019s two strongest captains. This trip to the Black Meeting was too important, so he was sent here to maintain order.Like Uncle Zhao, he was also one of the few outer force martial arts masters of the Strength Proficiency level venerated in the city.Chen Dewu glanced at Lu Sheng, then continued, \u201cBe it inner force or outer force, they\u2019re all training in strength. The route of outer force training emphasizes increasing one\u2019s physical muscular strength by training with external strikes and forcibly stimulating one\u2019s own body. Such a method surely takes its toll on the body, but increases strength very rapidly.The route of inner force training focuses on cultivating and tempering the internal organs and nourishing Qi and blood. Although this method takes much longer as it raises one\u2019s strength at a slower pace, it doesn\u2019t damage the body and can increase one\u2019s lifespan.That\u2019s the difference between inner and outer force. Actually, pinnacle outer force experts can hold their own against inner force cultivators. The really powerful ones are those who practice both inner force and outer force\u2026\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Zheng Xiangui remarked in realization.Lu Sheng nodded as well. \u201cI\u2019ve heard Uncle Zhao say the same before as well.\u201d\u201cThen why\u2019s everyone still so mad about inner force training? Both are on par in terms of raising one\u2019s strength anyway,\u201d Zheng Xiangui raised a doubt.\u201cFor longevity, of course\u2026 strong as they may be, outer force experts are past their prime the moment they\u2019re past thirty. But once you have inner force, you can extend your prime into your fifties or even sixties. The two are entirely incomparable,\u201d Chen Dewu replied with longing.Presently, Lu Sheng\u2019s attention was focused on the secret manual on the stage, for which the bidding was about to start.The host pointed at the black cloth manual in the tray.\u201cBidding begins now. The starting price is a hundred talents!\u201d\u201cA hundred and thirty talents.\u201d\u201cA hundred and fifty!\u201d\u201cTwo hundred!\u201d\u201cThree hundred!\u201d\u201cThree hundred thirty talents!\u201dOne by one, the bidders increased the price. Even some of those who\u2019d made sarcastic comments earlier were participating.That went to show that while everyone had reservations about the manual, they were still rather confident in the Black Meeting\u2019s reputation and examination standards.\u201cSomebody\u2019s purposely jacking up the price,\u201d Fatso mumbled.Lu Sheng\u2019s narrowed eyes were staring at the stage.\u201cFive hundred talents!\u201d He raised his arm and shouted.The entire meeting fell into silence momentarily at the sudden increment of a hundred talents.In this age, the purchasing power of five hundred talents was equivalent to five hundred thousand Chinese dollars.All for a manual whose authenticity wasn\u2019t proven and might contain mistakes or omissions.\u201cFive hundred and fifty talents,\u201d a voice rang out again.Lu Sheng looked over. It was a yellow-skinned man with drooping eyes.His masked face also appeared dry and skinny, as if without much meat or skin. His eyes, however, looked savage. One look revealed that he was no kind-hearted soul.Lu Sheng had expected such a situation. How could something like an inner force secret manual not be fought over?Not taking it to heart, he continued raising his arm.\u201cSix hundred talents.\u201d\u201cSeven hundred talents!\u201dIt was him again. Lu Sheng had only just raised a bid and he immediately followed.\u201cEight hundred talents!\u201d Lu Sheng said calmly. His dad Lu Quanan had given him two thousand talents for his monthly allowance. Even if it cost him all of it, he would use them all to win this manual.Anyway, with the Modifier, all it took was some possibility of being initiated in a martial art for him to find its name on the Modifier and modify it directly to its extreme.\u201cNine hundred talents!\u201dThat man\u2019s savage eyes glared towards Lu Sheng.\u201cA thousand talents,\u201d Lu Sheng said composedly.\u201c\u2026 One thousand and one hundred talents!\u201d The other party\u2019s voice now sounded slightly forced. \u201cFriend, I\u2019m of the Zhang family of the White Jade. Give me some face.\u201d\u2018Zhang family of the White Jade?\u2019 Lu Sheng\u2019s face twitched.This Zhang family wasn\u2019t from the Nine Links City; rather, it was the top family in the nearby Zi Hua City \u2013 the family of the Zi Hua Prefect Zhang Song.\u201cOh, the Zhang family of the White Jade. To think that they\u2019d come over to our Nine Links City to hunt for stuff\u2026\u201d Beside him, Zheng Xiangui\u2019s voice was overflowing with surprise.His Zheng family was in charge of the Black Meeting and was concerned only with the auction. They didn\u2019t care about where the guests had come from.\u201cOne thousand two hundred talents!\u201dLu Sheng raised his arm again.Anger smoldered in the eyes of the man from Zhang family. In the region near Nine Links and Zi Hua City, he had never encountered anyone who stepped on the Zhang family\u2019s face like this thus far.The Zhang family did not merely possess the Prefect Zhang Song. They were also proud to have within their ranks the number one expert of Zi Hua City \u2013 Zhang Songxi.They had spread their influence in both the government and the underside of the society \u2013 that was their greatest assurance when they did as they pleased outside.\u201cJust ignore him. Items auctioned at a Black Meeting go to the person with the highest bid. Even the Zhang family doesn\u2019t dare to break this rule lightly. Or else who would still work with them in their jade business?\u201d Zheng Xiangui gloated in his misfortune.The man from Zhang family was named Zhang Jundong \u2013 a specialist who had come to Nine Links City to gather any and all secret inner force manuals that may appear.Actually, the Zhang family had eyes on every secret inner force manual on the market and would intercept them before they were retrieved and placed on auction.Only this one fell through a gap in their net in Nine Links City as it was deposited at a Black Meeting for auction by a client who had arrived abruptly. Since it didn\u2019t go through the regular route, it escaped their interception.\u201cOne thousand three hundred talents!\u201d Zhang Jundong gritted his teeth and raised his arm again.\u201cOne thousand four hundred!\u201d Lu Sheng refused to yield in the slightest.Presently, only the two of them were competing against each other; none of the rest intended to take part in it.\u201cOne thousand five hundred talents!\u201d Zhang Jundong glared at Lu Sheng unflinchingly. \u201cFriend, when you\u2019re out on the roads, it\u2019s better to have more friends. Let me have this manual today and the Zhang family will remember this favor.\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s face did not change.\u201cOne thousand six hundred talents.\u201dHe raised his arm and bid again.Zhang Jundong was thoroughly incensed. He had come primarily for this Black Fury Skill, expecting to acquire it within an estimate of a thousand talents and pocketing the rest of the fund. Little did he expect that an ill-mannered weirdo would jump out of nowhere and compete with him so stubbornly.\u201cOne thousand, seven hundred and fifty talents!\u201d He rose to his feet without warning, placing all of his money onto his bid at one go.\u201cOne thousand eight hundred!\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s face was impassive.Zhang Jundong turned his head and glared at Lu Sheng with murderous intent.\u201cWell done! Very good,\u201d he declined to say a word more and gauged Lu Sheng from top to toe with his eyes instead, as if trying to commit every detail about him to his memory.With a wave of his arm, Zhang Jundong rose in anger and stormed out.\u201cCongratulations to this mister,\u201d the host smiled from ear to ear. For an inner force manual whose authenticity and accuracy was uncertain to fetch such a high price\u2026 he was bound to earn a commission several times higher than usual.Receiving the secret manual, Lu Sheng handed over the silver notes.Then, he left on his own after telling Zheng Xiangui that he\u2019s going to leave first. He didn\u2019t even stay to look at the last item on auction.He got his goods and was out of money.Chen Wude followed him all the way out and even brought along two guards, fearing Lu Sheng may suffer a mishap.Following the route from which he had come, he left the karst cave. Lu Sheng looked at the skies outside; it was already deep into the night.The Zheng family\u2019s horse carriage was already waiting outside.Chen Wude could not go far and so let a few guards leave with Lu Sheng. He himself returned to stay by Young Master Zheng Xiangui\u2019s side.Bringing three guards along with him, Lu Sheng exited the stone house and was about to board the carriage.\u201cHoo\u2026\u201dAll of a sudden, a gust of wind blew over from the surroundings of the village.A guard went on the alert and surveyed the surroundings but found nothing wrong.\u201cTCH!\u201dWith the soft sound of friction, a black shadow flew past a guard without warning, penetrating the small circle of guards and rushing straight for Lu Sheng who was right at its center.The black shadow moved extremely fast. The guards\u2019 formation was completely bypassed before they could even react.\u201cDANG, DANG, DANG!\u201dThree sharp clangs rang out. A short blade in the black shadow\u2019s hand had swiftly left cuts on the arms of the three guards.The three grunted in pain and quickly retreated, clutching their wrists.They were merely mercenaries employed by the Zheng family as guards, not die-hard loyalists. Naturally, they weren\u2019t going to put their lives on the line for the Zheng family.Seeing that the black shadow could not be stopped, they might as well focus on their own safety. After all, they already had wounds on their wrists to show for their efforts.Harboring such thoughts, their formation of three instantly broke apart, completely exposing Lu Sheng within it.\u201cDie!\u201d A deep, raspy voice came out of the black figure\u2019s mouth.He lifted his short blade and slashed towards Lu Sheng\u2019s chest violently.Despite his speed and strength decreasing considerably after wounding the three men, it was still a piece of cake for him to deal with an ordinary rich young master.Moreover, even if the other party was a martial arts practitioner, it wouldn\u2019t make a difference. Apart from a few in Nine Links City that could be counted on one hand, none of the fighters in this region were his match.Before striking, Zhang Jundong had carefully observed that the other party was not among their ranks.While he introduced himself a member of the Zhang family at the auction, he simultaneously harbored another identity.He was none other but one of the notorious bandit chiefs outside Zi Hua City!Since he was outbid at the auction and failed to secure the manual, then he might as well take it by force. It wouldn\u2019t be his first time doing so after all. And, no one at the Black Meeting would guarantee the safety of its bidders anyway.After killing the other party and securing the manual, he could even save over a thousand talents out of nothing for his own expenditure. So, why not?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2019ve got only yourself to blame for provoking someone you shouldn\u2019t have!\u201dThe tip of the blade cut through Lu Sheng\u2019s clothes, slashing onto his skin.\u201cBANG!!!\u201dAt exactly that moment, Lu Sheng\u2019s body fell backwards. From behind his waist, he withdrew a long-hilted saber that looked like a black python.The saber swept out violently from behind his back, the blade brutally slashing into the dagger in Zhang Jundong\u2019s hands. Zhang Jundong\u2019s blade move was at the end of its trajectory and thus exhausted most of its strength, and could not compare in the least to the immense speed of his counterstrike.The dagger flew up high into the air from that single hit.Lu Sheng\u2019s blade flipped, aiming immediately for Zhang Jundong\u2019s head with Tiger Kill.\u201cHOO!\u201dZhang Jundong\u2019s pupils contracted as the faint sound of a tiger\u2019s roar rapidly approached him through the air.All his hair stood on end; he could not possibly imagine that this young master of a wealthy family, protected by three guards, would actually erupt with such fearsome strength in but an instant!\u2018What reaction, such speed! Not good!\u2019He had no time to think about anything else. Retreating in a backward flip, both his feet skidded about seven or eight steps before he turned around in an attempt to flee.\u201cTCH!\u201dThe tip of a long-hilted saber pierced through his chest.Blood gradually oozed out from the wound.\u201cTCH!\u201dLu Sheng walked over and reached out to pull the saber out from his body, wiping it clean on the corpse\u2019s clothing.\u201cCome, send me back.\u201dCalmly, he boarded the horse carriage and let down the carriage curtains, leaving behind the three guards at the scene and the two who were guarding the door.Neither the five of them nor the coachman said a word as they looked at the corpse on the ground.The three guards were especially silent. Their faces were ashen as they quietly boarded the horse carriage.\u201cGo!\u201dThe coachman flicked the horsewhip and the carriage slowly began to move. Only the sounds of the carriage wheels turning could be heard within the carriage.The three guards sat facing Lu Sheng for a moment. However, they were unable to bear with the silence. One by one, they helped each other out of the carriage to walk alongside it.Soon, Lu Sheng was left alone inside the carriage.He sat up straight on a round cloth cushion, his face expressionless. He closed his eyes slightly, as if to take a nap.However, only he knew in that moment how tumultuous were the waves of turmoil within his heart.\u2018I killed someone\u2026\u2019He killed a person\u2026!Be it in his past life or the present one, he had not even injured anybody before, much less take away their life.However, in that earlier moment, he had reacted purely based on his basic instincts. Seeing that the other party was about to escape, he had decisively raised his saber and thrust forward.The incredible muscle memory gained after modification very smoothly extended the saber and executed the second move of Tiger Might, piercing through the opponent\u2019s heart from the back with great precision.After that, his opponent died.The scene from earlier constantly replayed itself in Lu Sheng\u2019s mind. That man hadn\u2019t been kidding about it, he\u2019d seriously wanted him dead.As he felt threatened, Lu Sheng\u2019s primal instincts made him counter the threat with force and eliminate it.And, in the end, it had indeed been completely eliminated.However, he had also exposed his martial arts skills.And even killed someone.\u2018The good thing is, the Black Tiger Saber Technique moves are unique and distinctive. With a bit of investigation, they\u2019ll be able to clearly trace them back to Uncle Zhao. That\u2019s not such a big deal, but I\u2019ve got to be careful in the future\u2026\u2019The horse carriage moved along slowly. It was about half an hour since they had left the village.\u201cRing-ling-ling\u2026 ring-ling-ling\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t clear when it began, but clear and crisp sounds of a tolling bell gradually drifted over with the wind, coming from somewhere in the pitch darkness outside.The coachman gazed backwards and saw a white horse carriage speedily closing in from behind. From the looks of it, they were also hurrying along towards Nine Links City.The three guards also saw the white horse carriage approaching from the back.Two large pristine-white horses pulled an intricately designed white carriage, carved with many exquisite silver flower motifs. A faint fragrance emanated from the carriage and drifted with the wind.The three of them looked at each other, instinctively grasping their broadswords. Earlier, they had failed to protect a distinguished guest and almost let him meet with a mishap. If they failed again, the Zheng Family would definitely not let them off.Their wrists were also not too badly hurt from earlier. After applying medication to it and resting a bit, they were now able to exert roughly seventy or eighty percent of their strength.All three were veterans who had previously joined the army. With the three of them forming a mini-formation, defeating seven, eight ordinary men would pose no problem at all.There was nothing extraordinary about the white carriage other than the fact that it was more luxurious, which wasn\u2019t a big deal.However, what unsettled some of them was that the lanterns guiding that carriage actually weren\u2019t lit!In the wilderness beyond the city, and especially so on a gloomy, moonless night, it was nigh impossible to continue forward in pitch darkness if one did not light the lanterns, even on a road.Yet this horse carriage was traveling at an extremely high speed, even faster than their own lantern-lit carriage!\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong,\u201d one of the three said in a low voice.Lu Sheng pulled back his curtains and glanced to the back, and also saw the white carriage rushing along in the dead of the night. A man with a gentle and handsome countenance was driving the horse carriage. Clearly, it was the guy from earlier in the Black Meeting \u2013 the gentle-looking man who guarded the woman by his side.The white horse carriage sped along with nary a pause; soon, it gradually passed by the side of Lu Sheng\u2019s horse carriage.\u201cAh Jiu, let\u2019s stop for a bit.\u201dA beautiful, melodious voice of a woman sounded out from within the white carriage and it immediately slowed down to travel head to head with Lu Sheng\u2019s carriage.The curtains slowly lifted to reveal a charmingly coquettish face with a slight frown, lit by the lantern.It was that woman from before \u2013 Duanmu Wan!Lu Sheng put on a poker face as he looked at the other party.\u201cYoung Master, the roads are extremely dark tonight, can I borrow one of your lanterns to light the way? Take it as us watching out for each other?\u201dDuanmu Wan had also noticed Lu Sheng and flashed him a smile.\u201c\u2026Sure, Miss Duanmu.\u201dLu Sheng replied placidly, and then proceeded to lower his curtains.\u201cYoung Master, if little miss may be so bold as to ask another favor,\u201d that Duanmu Wan spoke again without waiting for him to retreat back to his carriage, \u201cI knocked over a teapot in this carriage of mine, wetting the round seat cushion and everything here. Could I please\u2026\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s eyes narrowed as a sense of caution rose within him.This Duanmu Wan appeared rather suspicious. \u2018She says it\u2019s wet inside her carriage, but who really knows?\u2019The manner in which the other party caught up with them in the dark of the night was very suspicious; it seemed to be deliberate in order to strike up a conversation. Even if he refused, there was no guarantee that Duanmu Wan would let him off.\u201cIf Miss doesn\u2019t mind my shabby horse carriage, then please come up here to rest for a bit.\u201d Currently, he had achieved full mastery of the Back Tiger Saber Technique, achieving extraordinary battle scores in the past two consecutive battles. Gradually, he gained some confidence in himself by now.He was confident of holding his own in a duel against any average martial expert, or even someone like Uncle Zhao, who was the foremost expert in Nine Links City. Even though he was sorely lacking in battle experience, the fourth level of the Black Tiger Saber Technique seemed to have given him a strength that surpassed even that of Uncle Zhao\u2019s.Given a short time and a small space, it would be difficult to say whether he or Uncle Zhao would win.So, even though Duanmu Wan had remarkable skills, he believed he had the means to protect himself.\u201cThank you very much, Young Master.\u201dUnder the swaying lights of the lanterns, Lu Sheng instructed the coachman to stop. The white horse carriage also gradually came to a stop.The carriage doors slid open. Duanmu Wan, still dressed in her black miniskirt from earlier, slowly walked over.She lifted her head and flashed a smile towards Lu Sheng, who was opening the carriage door for her. Her exquisite, fair skin, cherry dark-red lips, and her delicate pink tongue that slowly darted across her lips caused the surrounding guards\u2019 and the coachman\u2019s hearts to unwittingly skip a beat.She slowly stepped up the carriage by Lu Sheng\u2019s side.In the moment she did so, the black dress that barely covered her rode up slightly to reveal a pair of long slender legs and a round, tender rear.The view beneath her skirt flashed for a moment, just enough for Lu Sheng to see a little, yet not very much.\u201cAiya.\u201dDuanmu Wan\u2019s body suddenly twisted as she sprained the back of her feet, her whole body flinging itself onto Lu Sheng.\u201cCareful,\u201d Lu Sheng hastily reached out to support her.Inwardly, however, he grew even more cautious. He chuckled coldly in his mind as he recognized the same \u201ccoincidence\u201d so often portrayed in the romance dramas on Earth.Still, he did not let it show. Instead, he just intended to respond according to common sense.Duanmu Wan fell softly and feebly into the nook of his arm. The surging waves of her chest accidentally rubbed against Lu Sheng\u2019s forearm.Instantly, Duanmu Wan\u2019s face flushed red as she lowered her head, righting herself as if she just experienced a slight electric shock.Lu Sheng\u2019s mind also shook, and he held onto her even more firmly.\u201cMany thanks, Young Master\u2026\u201d Duanmu Wan said in a meek voice.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Do take a seat,\u201d Lu Sheng supported her to the seat at the side of the carriage.Within the large interior, there were two rows of four seats opposite of each other. Lu Sheng sat across from Duanmu Wan.The horse carriage again began to move slowly.Duanmu Wan sat there with her face flushed, both her legs slanted to the side, tightly closed together without even a slight crack between them. Just that, from Lu Sheng\u2019s point of view opposite of her, he could see the hint of a shadow in the space between her skirt and her thighs. If only Lu Sheng wanted to, he could follow the shadow with his gaze and fully peek at the view beneath her skirt.In any case, there were only the two of them within the carriage. Moreover, Duanmu Wan\u2019s head was lowered in embarrassment at this moment, and could not see him.\u201cPeng.\u201dSuddenly, the horse carriage seemed to grind over something and jumped a little.Duanmu Wan\u2019s legs shook slightly from the impact, revealing a sliver of a crack.By now, a small section of the view beneath her skirt was revealed to Lu Sheng. His gaze swept over from the corner of his eye, catching a faint glimpse of a patch of white.\u201cIs Young Master headed towards Nine Links City?\u201dDuanmu Wan seemed not to notice that she had exposed herself as she asked gently.\u201cThat\u2019s right, you\u2019re heading there too, Miss?\u201d Lu Sheng casually asked a pointless question.\u201cYep. To be honest, Wan\u2019er is currently staying at the Thousand Blessings Inn in the city. I heard that there was a Black Meeting\u2026 so, along with my guard, we came here to check it out. Who knew everyone was going to be masked! How boring,\u201d Duanmu Wan seemed rather dissatisfied.\u201cFor Wan\u2019er and a personal bodyguard to travel such a long distance by yourselves, it sure takes great skill and boldness!\u201d Lu Sheng said calmly.\u201cWhat skill? It\u2019s only because we were saved by a merchant group on the way that we were able to successfully arrive at Nine Links City. Otherwise, Wan\u2019er and the guard would have perished from hunger or cold in some remote corner along the journey,\u201d Wan\u2019er explained.\u201cSpeaking of which, the Young Master who saved Wan\u2019er is as strong as you in terms of martial arts prowess,\u201d Duanmu Wan smiled lightly.\u201cIs that so?\u201dHearing that, Lu Sheng knew that she had witnessed that earlier scene of him fighting.\u201cAt the Black Meeting, Wan\u2019er saw that Young Master seemed to really need inner force secret manuals?\u201d Duanmu Wan asked again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Kurisu\u201cIndeed,\u201d Lu Sheng touched his tiger mask, caution rising in his heart. \u201cCould it be that Wan\u2019er has a way?\u201d\u201cWan\u2019er does indeed have a way to find a few inner force secret manuals for young master. But what will young master offer in exchange for them?\u201d Duanmu Wan asked in a meek and gentle tone.\u2018What a bold claim. Find a few of them? Even the Prefect in the city would not dare to say such a thing,\u2019 Lu Sheng was extremely cautious now.\u201cWhat does Miss Wan\u2019er want in exchange? Will silver or gold do?\u201d\u201cHow about the same price as today\u2019s Black Fury Skill?\u201d Duanmu Wan smiled.\u201cIf Miss Wan\u2019er really can get me those manuals, yes,\u201d Lu Sheng replied seriously, gazing deeply at this woman.Unbothered by Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze, Duanmu Wan laughed.\u201cYoung master need not worry. Wan\u2019er just saw that you, young master, look handsome and have an extraordinary air about you, and so wants to win some favor with you in advance.\u201dAs if Lu Sheng would believe her.The horse carriage advanced slowly and entered the city shortly after, stopping outside the Thousand Blessings Inn.Duanmu Wan and her guard alighted and walked towards the inn under the warm welcome of the inn\u2019s waiter.On the carriage, Lu Sheng watched quietly as the two figures disappeared inside the inn. His poker face betrayed none of his thoughts.\u201cLet\u2019s go back,\u201d he instructed.Only then did the coachman come to his senses, looking as if he had just awoken from a dream. Wiping the saliva off the corner of his mouth, he spurred the horses to continue the journey.As for the three guards, they were no better, showing looks of disappointment on their faces when Duanmu Wan departed.***On the morning of the second day, back in the manor, Zheng Xiangui personally made a visit. Clearly, it was to apologize for yesterday\u2019s events.The two of them sat in the garden in the backyard. A stone table was laden with wine flasks and side dishes to go with it \u2013 a plate of peanuts and a plate of cold mixed carrots.Under the hot sun, such food was incredibly refreshing.\u201cI must drink this cup!\u201dZheng Xiangui said earnestly, lifting his wine cup.\u201cYesterday was my oversight. When I heard about the news, it scared the guts out of me. If any mishap came to you, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do right by the Lu family even if I cut off all the meat from my body.\u201dLu Sheng shook his head, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault; I was the one who insisted that you make the arrangements,\u201d he argued.Zheng Xiangui emptied his cup with a gulp and slammed the cup back on the table-top.\u201cPah.\u201dA soft sound rang out as the cup hit the table.\u201cBrother Sheng, I found it really strange right from the start\u2026 how was it that you had the guts to risk going to a Black Meeting to buy stuff, not to mention the rest.In the end, turns out you had so many cards hidden up your sleeves, didn\u2019t you? But when it comes to things like dueling with others face-to-face, I think you better lay it off. Even if they\u2019re the Zhang family, your Lu family isn\u2019t to be trifled with in the Nine Links City. Can their hands reach here? However, even if they can\u2019t, why take a risk? What if something happens to you\u2026\u201dLu Sheng smiled.\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ve been passionate about martial arts since my childhood. I\u2019ve just kept it under wraps because I\u2019ve never achieved anything. Now that I\u2019ve got some small accomplishment in this area, I couldn\u2019t resist the itch for some hands-on practice at the Black Meeting.\u201d\u201cHands-on practice? You killed someone,\u201d Zheng Xiangui was speechless. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to let Uncle Lu know about this, in case the Zhang family lays the blame on you. At least he\u2019ll be prepared.\u201d\u201cThat I know,\u201d Lu Sheng nodded. \u201cSpeaking of which, do you know more about the background of that Duanmu Wan?\u201d\u201cDuanmu Wan\u2026 That, I really don\u2019t. How about I check it out for you?\u201d Zheng Xiangui said hesitatingly. Because his Zheng family was used to dealing with a more complicated lot, they had a lot more connections and intelligence sources than the Lu Manor and so were stronger in that area.\u201cMight as well.\u201dLu Sheng poured a cup of wine for himself and sipped lightly on it.The wine here was very diluted, to the point that it was almost no different from fruit juice beverages.\u201cWhy? Duanmu Wan contacted you?\u201d Zheng Xiangui quizzed.Lu Sheng was about to answer.Abruptly, the sound of hurried footsteps came from the garden\u2019s raised circular entrance.A teenage girl in the prime of her youth, dressed in goose-yellow short robes, entered with quick steps.The teenage girl was born with a goose egg-shaped face, her waist so slender as if it could be easily broken by one light grasp.Her robes were open at the front, revealing the pure white inner layer underneath, which kept her full breasts tightly covered. But, because her breasts were too full, they bounced up and down as she walked.\u201cBrother, Brother Sheng, so you guys were hiding here after all!\u201dUpon seeing Lu Sheng and Zheng Xiangui, she stormed over and pulled on Zheng Xiangui.\u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go, stupid brother! You stood me up and left me waiting at home for two whole hours!\u201d\u201cYu\u2019er, long time no see. Looks like you aren\u2019t in a great mood?\u201dLu Sheng smiled and greeted her.\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018cause of my old brother again\u2026 he said he\u2019d bring me to watch the opera troupe in the northern sector of the city. They\u2019re leaving in the afternoon. If we don\u2019t go now, we\u2019ll be there too late! I waited for so long but he didn\u2019t show up.\u201dZheng Yu\u2019er was Zheng Xiangui\u2019s sister. Biological sister, to be exact.The two of them were extremely close since childhood. Because of Lu Sheng and Zheng Xiangui\u2019s friendship, Zheng Yu\u2019er was also close with Lu Sheng as well.\u201cYu\u2019er, my bad\u2026\u201dZheng Xiangui hurried to apologize, a look of sadness on his face.\u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you, I\u2019ll make it up to you! Whatever you want, I\u2019ll buy it for you!\u201dAs the second son who controlled part of the family\u2019s business, Zheng Xiangui\u2019s cash flow and allowance was far beyond that of his sister.\u201cI want a purple ink brush, three slabs of ink, ten boxes of cosmetic powder from Red Moon Seal, five packets of powder-needles every day, a stalk of coral flower every day\u2026\u201dZheng Yu\u2019er listed her conditions, rapid like a machine gun; clearly, she had been prepared for it beforehand.But before she got past a few lines, she was struck by the sudden awareness that Lu Sheng was present, and immediately bowed her head in embarrassment.Then she stepped hard on Zheng Xiangui\u2019s foot.\u201cAIYOH!\u201d Zheng Xiangui\u2019s pitiful scream echoed in the garden.\u201cGood sister, good sister! Let\u2019s go home! We\u2019ll talk when we get back!\u201dNot long later.Lu Sheng looked on amused as Zheng Yu\u2019er dragged Zheng Xiangui home, holding him by his ear.Sitting on the stone bench by himself, he watched the servants clean up the wine and dishes.\u201cBlack Fury Skill\u2026 it can improve my body\u2019s constitution, but it\u2019s incomplete and so not particularly suited for me to practice. What a pity\u2026 I don\u2019t have any better option right now.\u201dHe shut his eyes and began imagining a thread of Qi rise upwards from the soles of his feet, then gather into his abdomen before spreading all over his body according to the route recorded in the Black Fury Skill.This was the method of initiation into Level One of the Black Fury Skill.Simple as it may be, it was highly demanding in terms of one\u2019s innate talent. According to the manual, it took at least several days to a month to generate Qi.This wasn\u2019t considered long.His first step was to be initiated in this skill. Only then could he find the corresponding skill on the Modifier and begin modification.So, there was no way around this for Lu Sheng.\u201cYoung Master.\u201dLittle Qiao walked out from her room and called softly.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dLittle Qiao looked at Lu Sheng. Young Master seemed rather distracted lately, but she did not know the cause.\u201cIs there something bothering Young Master?\u201d Always the kind and understanding one, Little Qiao asked carefully.\u201cDon\u2019t make wild guesses, it\u2019s my own problem,\u201d Lu Sheng sat on the bench, closed his eyes and began rocking his body back and forth lightly.A dark blue Modifier screen floated before his eyes.Lu Sheng surveyed it from top to bottom, finding it written in an empty slot in the first row: Black Tiger Saber Technique \u2013 Level 4.As for the Black Fury Skill, no sign of it was in sight. With a thought, Lu Sheng closed the Modifier and rose from the stone bench.Since the Black Fury Skill was in his hands, he would persist in practicing it. As long as there was a thread of possibility for him to be initiated in it, his trip would not be wasted.In the following few days.Lu Sheng did not go anywhere else. Instead, he sat tight within the Lu Manor, hard at work training his martial arts.Since his Black Tiger Saber Technique was exposed, he might as well no longer hide it. It wasn\u2019t that big a deal of a skill anyway.At the same time, Lu Sheng began consulting Uncle Zhao about some key tactics and actual fight experience. His main purpose in doing so was to intentionally reveal that he had learnt some of the Black Tiger Saber Technique by himself.Although he had mastered the saber technique, he still needed detailed advice on its actual usage, including when to strike, which move to use against what kind of opponents\u2026 these were all based on experience.Exploiting the opportunity, he spread the story of how he had been practicing martial arts in secret across the entire Lu Manor.***Three days later\u2026\u201cDang, dang dang dang!\u201dOn the arena, both Lu Sheng and Uncle Zhao wielded a saber each as they rapidly traded blows.Two streaks of light, reflected off their sabers, rolled all over and collided into each other every other second, like two balls of silver.Without warning, Uncle Zhao dodged sideways, evading a saber slash.With a solemn expression and his hair flying behind him, his eyes widened suddenly.\u201cTiger Kill!\u201d\u201cROAR!\u201dA tiger\u2019s roar rang out from within the winds as the long saber in Uncle Zhao\u2019s hands hacked towards Lu Sheng\u2019s wrists like a meteor!\u201cTiger Kill!\u201dAt almost that exact moment, Lu Sheng too growled and struck with Tiger Kill as well!The two had battled on for a long time before Lu Sheng pretended to barely react, adjusting \u201cjust in time\u201d to use Tiger Kill.His rhythm was slower by more than a beat.\u201cDANG!\u201dTwo saber\u2019s edges collided ferociously.Then, the two figures parted, each staring at the other, panting heavily.Lu Sheng lowered his head and saw that a section of his right sleeve was missing. Immediately, a look of reverence appeared on his face.\u201cAs expected of Uncle Zhao!\u201dHe smiled as he kept his saber and stood straight.\u201cIt\u2019s already very powerful\u2026 very powerful\u2026 to be able to use Tiger Kill in so short a time. Even if Young Master used to practice martial arts in secret, how long has it been since you got the saber technique\u2026? Given time, there\u2019s no question that Young Master will certainly surpass an old man like me. Even in the entire Nine Links City, you\u2019d secure a spot in the Top 5,\u201d Uncle Zhao exclaimed.\u201cTo think that I assumed that Young Master had given up on practicing the saber\u2026 who would have thought\u2026\u201dLu Sheng laughed.\u201cStop joking, Uncle Zhao. You\u2019re one of the top four experts of Nine Links City, how can I surpass you that easily?\u201d\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m not worthy of that title. I\u2019m old and long since past the valor of my youth,\u201d Uncle Zhao waved his hand hurriedly.\u201cBut Young Master\u2019s talent is astonishing\u2026 to be able to master the first move of the Black Tiger Saber Technique in such a short time. You can actually consider learning a few more martial arts.\u201d\u201cLearning a few more martial arts? Uncle Zhao means\u2026?\u201d Lu Sheng raised his brows.Uncle Zhao laughed.\u201cI, Old Zhao, still have some face in the Nine Links City after all. On the other hand, Young Master, your Lu family is famous for your wealth. With these two combined together, I should be able to persuade more than a few old fogeys to take out their crown jewels \u2013 their highest martial arts \u2013 and teach them to you.Speaking of which, these supposedly highest martial arts can all rank as Third Class martial arts. Most of them are on par with the Black Tiger Saber Technique. If Young Master is interested, I can introduce you to these people.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0\u2013 \u2013Hearing this, Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes shone brightly.He had been unable to find powerful martial arts manuals in their complete form. Since that was the case, he could perhaps make up for quality with quantity.Anyway, with the Modifier, he was able to cultivate martial arts at an astonishing speed, reaching full mastery with just a bit of effort. To cultivate a few more skills in this manner should very likely help him to achieve his objective.In this world, demons, devils, ghosts and monsters could appear at any time. If he did not make use of time to quickly become stronger now, then when he really met with danger, what could he possibly defend himself with?Thinking of this, Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes shone brightly again. He understood what Uncle Zhao meant.There was quite a number of old fogeys who practiced martial arts in Nine Links City. For example, the yamen\u2019s previous Chief Constable Zhang Xun, whose Heart-Shattering Palm technique was extremely powerful. Now that he was older and without children, he was left without a successor.He did not have many assets left and was living a hard life, unable to make ends meet. Often, he had to rely on old friends like Uncle Zhao to get by.If Lu Sheng was able to use money and connections to pull some strings, it would probably be very easy to get him to pass the Heart-Shattering Palm technique on to him.Back in the days, when Zhang Xun was younger, he was actually termed the Number One Expert in Nine Links City!It was only when he got older that the others caught up to him. At eighty-six years of age, he was much older than Uncle Zhao, and his legs were no longer nimble.When Uncle Zhao and the rest rose to prominence, he had already been retired for many years.Nine Links City had no shortage of such former experts.Lu Sheng\u2019s heart surged. If he were able to learn a thing or two from these people and master their skills to very high levels, it would cumulatively result in extreme power even if they were all Third Class martial arts.\u201cHow is it? Young Master, if you are willing, I can get in touch with some suitable old friends for you.\u201dUncle Zhao also hoped to help look out for some of his old friends. Perhaps he couldn\u2019t bear to see his old friends living miserable lives in their evening years despite their capabilities.Lu Sheng thought it over in detail.\u201cUncle Zhao is right on point. However, which experts are you able to get in touch with?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bother about which ones. Beware of biting off more than you can chew. What I can guarantee are the Heart-Shattering Palm and the Eighty-Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade.These two old friends of mine lost their heirs to enemy factions long ago. Now, they have no one to rely on and lead a tough life. They have long since intended to find a disciple to inherit their skills.However, as the saying goes, martial arts are the hobby of the rich. When it comes to practicing martial arts, without sufficient resources to nourish the body, training hard will only harm one\u2019s health. So they didn\u2019t think it was right to put others in harm\u2019s way and thus didn\u2019t choose anyone,\u201d Uncle Zhao said ruefully.\u201cIt just so happens that, Brother Sheng, you are bestowed with exceptional innate talent and are gifted above the rest. While we don\u2019t harbor hopes for the top-notch martial arts of the big factions and clans, it would be very impressive if you do master these two skills. It fulfills Brother Sheng\u2019s requirements, and also helps me look after a few good friends \u2013 killing two birds with one stone!\u201dSeeing him lay out his personal intentions and considerations, Lu Sheng\u2019s face turned somber.\u201cSince Uncle Zhao has given your word, then these two elders will both be my teachers. The manor will send them twenty talents of silver monthly as teaching fee.\u201dHearing this, Uncle Zhao could not help but smile.\u201cBrother Sheng is indeed magnanimous and compassionate\u2026\u201dActually, it cost barely ten talents of silver for one to learn an established skill from a typical martial arts academy.Yet, Lu Sheng gave each of them twenty talents without reservations and therefore gave a lot of face to Uncle Zhao.When word of it spread, Zhao Dahu would be able to hold his head up high in his circle of old friends.\u201cBrother Sheng, you continue with your practice, I will relay the news to my several friends.\u201dSince the matter had been decided, Uncle Zhao also could not wait to rush to find Zhang Xun to relay the good news!A while back, Zhang Xun had gotten the flu yet again. He initially had a body of iron, but had failed to maintain his health when he was younger and had suffered too many internal injuries. His health was now deteriorating and he lacked the money to care for his body.The medical fees from earlier were even lent to him by Uncle Zhao.If not for this, he would not have thought to recommend teachers to Lu Sheng.He really couldn\u2019t\u2026 just couldn\u2019t bear to see his good friend in such dire straits.\u201cAs you wish, Uncle Zhao,\u201d still holding onto the saber, Lu Sheng cupped his hands.Watching Uncle Zhao depart, Lu Sheng remained, standing alone on the arena.He lifted the saber and once again practiced the Black Tiger Saber Technique.Tiger Kill, Tiger Might, and Tiger Roar \u2013 separately, they were three different sets of combinations of saber techniques consisting of over ten moves.While the three big moves were separate individual strokes, in reality, they each contained quite a number of independent saber moves within themselves.For example, Tiger Kill consisted of saber moves targeting the front, moves targeting the back, as well as those targeting both the left and the right sides, as well as moves which targeted any hidden weapons, those against long-hilted weapons, others against heavy weapons\u2026There were many different kinds of such variations.It wasn\u2019t just that one move that required practice.As he trained, a servant suddenly ran to the side of the arena. The servant waited for him to finish practicing, as if he had something to relay.Lu Sheng\u2019s brow furrowed. He speedily kept his saber and stood up, gazing onto the servant.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cYoung Master, there\u2019s a horse carriage outside. A young lady who introduced herself as Miss Duanmu claims that she has an appointment with Young Master, and is here to visit,\u201d the servant replied respectfully.\u201cDuanmu\u2026 Duanmu Wan is here, eh.\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s heart trembled slightly.He had trained the Black Fury Skill ever since he got his hands on it, but till now, was still unable to become initiated in it.This casted doubt on the authenticity of this particular inner force skill. Duanmu Wan had said previously that she could get her hands on inner force secret manuals, but there was no way to know if they were legitimate.\u2018Forget it. I\u2019ll just meet her first and then worry about it.\u2019Although the other party was a shrewd character, he wasn\u2019t one of those pampered young masters within the city who were unused to the ways of the world. If she intended to seduce him with some evil purpose in mind, there was no way he would fall for her low-level skills, no matter how many of them she was capable of.\u201cInvite her into the guest hall, I\u2019ll be there shortly.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe servant left.Lu Sheng got the maidservant to prepare a basin of water, which he used to wipe some of the perspiration off his body. He then changed into a fresh set of white robes before heading to the guest hall.Walking past the arena and a little flower garden, and then heading down a corridor, he arrived at the guest hall meant solely for receiving guests.The guest hall\u2019s big doors were open, revealing a woman in a long purple dress seated primly to the right. The woman had a coquettish face, skin white as snow, and wore crescent-shaped earrings made from polished pearls. She carried a dignified and graceful air.Remarkably, it was none other than Duanmu Wan.Lu Sheng\u2019s third brother, Lu Chenxin, was also in the guest hall. Presently, he was enthusiastically trying to get intimate with Duanmu Wan.Lu Chenxin was mesmerized as he stared at Duanmu Wan\u2019s chest. The faint view of a deep ravine could be seen beneath the white camisole covering her chest, and his eyes seemed to sink into it and could not be pulled away even if he wanted to.\u201cCough, cough.\u201dLu Sheng lightly coughed twice.Both of them immediately noticed him and turned their heads to look at him.\u201cBig Bro\u2026\u201dLu Chenxin\u2019s face flushed bright-red, looking rather embarrassed as he stood up.\u201cSince Big Bro is here\u2026 this lady Miss Duanmu came specially to find you\u2026\u201dHe stuttered a little.\u201cThird Bro, how about you head over to the kitchen first to get them to send over some sour plum soup? I\u2019ll manage over here.\u201dLu Sheng was considered rather wise in the family. He had quite a bit of experience, and conducted himself responsibly. Thus, his words carried quite a bit of weight among the siblings.He wasn\u2019t frivolous like his peers, the other young masters.Altogether, he had two biological siblings. Second Sis Lu Qingqing had ventured out to practice martial arts and had yet to return; Third Bro Lu Chenxin stayed at home, diligently reading the traditional sage books to prepare for future examinations, hoping to attain scholarly honor. [1]As for Lu Sheng, he had even taken over the reins for a portion of the family\u2019s business a while back. His performance had long since affirmed Lu Quanan that he would be the one to take over the business in the future.Because Lu Sheng was bound to be the one to manage the family\u2019s finances in the future, his younger brother and sister, as well as the rest of the members of the household, all counted on him to provide for them in the future.In the day-to-day matters, everyone treated him with some measure of respect to curry favor with him.\u201cBrother Sheng, I just happened to bring over a pot of sour plum soup, I\u2019ll give it to you guys. It\u2019s been chilled, very tasty.\u201dFifth Mother, who had been passing by, smiled as she walked in from outside the guest hall with a pot of sour plum soup in her hands.Fifth Mother was the fifth woman the household head Lu Quanan had married. However, she was not his wife, but a concubine instead.Unlike the first three, Fifth Mother and her daughter, younger cousin Lu Yingying, would need to depend on Lu Sheng for a living after Old Master Lu Quanan passed on.Therefore, although she was Lu Sheng\u2019s Fifth Mother in name, more often than not she and younger cousin Lu Yingying treated Lu Sheng with deference.After all, once Lu Quanan passes on, Lu Sheng did not have any obligation to support the mother and daughter pair. In order to prevent them from being chased out of the house, it was necessary to butter up the future household head, Lu Sheng, in advance.\u201cYou\u2019re too kind, Fifth Mother.\u201d Lu Sheng hurriedly went over to receive the sour plum soup and laid it down. \u201cI can handle it over here, please head back first.\u201d\u201cYes yes yes, Brother Sheng you entertain your guest first.\u201d Smiling, Fifth Mother left hastily.Before leaving, she looked at Duanmu Wan with jealousy. She was only slightly over thirty this year, and although she maintained her looks well and surpassed others in appearance, she paled in comparison to Duanmu Wan.\u201cI\u2019ll leave a bit earlier,\u201d Lu Chenxin also quickly took this chance to leave.Soon, only Lu Sheng and Duanmu Wan were left in the guest hall.\u201cDoes young master still want secret manuals?\u201dSeeing that there weren\u2019t others around, Duanmu Wan smiled slightly as she asked.\u201cMiss Duanmu is indeed impressive. I hid my identity and disguised myself, yet you were still able to find me here,\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s face betrayed not a hint of emotion.\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, Young Master Lu. In the whole of Nine Links City, who else is such bosom buddies with Zheng Family\u2019s Zheng Xiangui, and has so many resources within the family? By roughly matching the height and physique, it is not difficult to identify you, young master.\u201dDuanmu Wan smiled gently.\u201cIt\u2019s not difficult to do so only for Miss Duanmu. Ok, enough with the nonsense. So, what secret manual has Miss Duanmu brought for me? I\u2019ll say first though, I\u2019m only interested in those inner force manuals.\u201dLu Sheng said casually in an unhurried and calm tone. He did not lose his cool just because his identity had been exposed.\u201cNaturally, they\u2019re all inner force manuals.\u201dDuanmu Wan extended her slender arms to retrieve from her sleeves three small booklets, placing them lightly onto the small side table one by one.All three light-green small booklets were sewn together with needle and thread. Clearly emblazoned across the cover were some large characters: \u201cGreen Pine One-Thought Formula\u201d, \u201cJade Crane Skill\u201d, \u201cYin Yang Attraction\u201d.Lu Sheng\u2019s face remained emotionless as he gazed over all of them.\u201cMiss Duanmu is indeed open-handed. Except\u2026 how will I verify whether these secret manuals are authentic?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s simple,\u201d Duanmu Wan smiled lightly. \u201cThese three types of inner force skills are all exceedingly easy to get initiated in. Just cultivate it for a day, and you\u2019ll be able to sense the Qi. However, on the other hand, it is difficult to achieve full mastery in any of them. Thus, it is easy to establish their authenticity.\u201dThen, with a change in tone, she added, \u201cAs for whether there\u2019re any alterations or omissions in them, young master, you\u2019ll have to trust Wan\u2019er. Otherwise, no matter what secret manuals are placed before you, I\u2019m afraid young master will be suspicious regardless.\u201d\u201cMiss Wan\u2019er is right to say so,\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s heart leapt with joy. If it were just as the other party said, that all three secret manuals were extremely easy to initiate, then compared to the Black Fury Skill, these three skills were way, way more suitable for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After mastering them, they won\u2019t add much to your fighting strength. They\u2019re suitable for passing down in the family to improve life force, and not suited for battling. Also, the highest they go is Level 2.\u201dDuanmu Wan reminded.\u201cLife force skills\u2026 and only two levels\u2026 don\u2019t you have any of those legitimate inner force skills from the pugilistic world?\u201d Lu Sheng frowned slightly.\u201cI do\u2026 But those kinds of inner force skills are mostly the property of sects and factions\u2026 even if I gave them to young master, would young master dare to cultivate them?\u201dDuanmu Wan\u2019s beautiful eyes stared at Lu Sheng, a hint of a laugh within them.Lu Sheng fell into silence, then laughed as well.\u201cIndeed. I don\u2019t dare to cultivate those inner force skills. Leaking the inner force skills of those sects leads to a never-ending vendetta.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s best that Young Master understands. Of course, I\u2019ve also got some low-end inner force skill manuals, but in comparison with these three, those manuals are extremely time-consuming and don\u2019t seem very powerful. So, these three are better.\u201dWith respect to Lu Sheng\u2019s immediate admission, Duanmu Wan was rather impressed. Before a beauty like her, almost all men would more or less subconsciously put on a strong and competitive front and try to project their heroic side.Yet Lu Sheng could unflinchingly say the three words \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t dare\u201d. It wasn\u2019t something that an average man would be able to do.\u201cThese three inner force skills don\u2019t match my requirements very well,\u201d Lu Sheng replied in a deep voice.\u201cYoung Master Lu, don\u2019t be so quick to reject them. You\u2019ve got to know that inner force skill manuals aren\u2019t cabbages. You can\u2019t expect them to come on demand,\u201d Duanmu Wan said with a wide smile. [1]\u201cIt\u2019s also by coincidence that I happen to have these manuals with me now. In a while, I may not\u2026\u201dLu Sheng didn\u2019t understand what she meant.\u201cCan\u2019t you just make copies of these manuals and sell them again and again?\u201d\u201cThat may be so, but those that I sell are all sole copies. The original copies,\u201d Duanmu Wan declared confidently.\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Lu Sheng was starting to get interested.\u201cOf course I\u2019m serious. As for that Black Fury Skill, Young Master Lu had better not cultivate it. Not only is it incomplete, it\u2019s passed down from hundreds of years ago. The possibility of finding the rest of the manual is virtually nil,\u201d Duanmu Wan advised.Lu Sheng fell deep in thought for a moment.\u201cDoes Miss Wan\u2019er have other secret manuals with her? I don\u2019t need the originals, just copies will do. How about one hundred talents for each manual?\u201dDuanmu Wan\u2019s face remained impassive except for a faint smile.\u201cIs Young Master Lu that crazy about martial arts?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m basically nuts about martial arts,\u201d Lu Sheng replied earnestly.Duanmu Wan looked at him with interest. The two of them stared at each other like that for a while before she suddenly laughed out.\u201cIn that case, money for the goods.\u201d\u201cAnd goods for the money. I want the Jade Crane Skill.\u201dLu Sheng picked one at random. He took out the silver notes from his chest pocket. It was the last of his savings and he was now left without a penny.Duanmu Wan received the notes and stuffed them into her sleeves without even a look before she placed the Jade Crane Skill down.\u201cThen I wish Young Master achieves full mastery of the martial art soon.\u201d\u201cThanks for your well-wishes,\u201d Lu Sheng rose to see her out.Only after walking Duanmu Wan to the gate and watching her board the carriage and leave did Lu Sheng finally heave a sigh of relief.For some unknown reason, he always found himself on his guard whenever he faced Duanmu Wan.She was clearly just a weak woman who knew no martial arts. But something about her felt off to him.He watched as the horse carriage lumbered on until it disappeared from sight at the end of the street. Only then did Lu Sheng turn back in.Holding the Jade Crane Skill manual in his hand, Lu Sheng hesitated. In the end, he decided to take a look at this inner force martial art first before doing anything else.***In the Nine Links City Prefect\u2019s yamen.The rectangular yamen courtyard faced the courtroom, its surface covered in white stone bricks which reflected the blinding light coming from the sunrays.In the courtyard, over ten red pillars supported a red rooftop. That was the courtroom.Two rows of Pride-Killing Cudgel, painted red, lined the sides of the courtyard. [2]The Old Master Prefect, Song Duanchi, sat atop the courtroom, his brows locked together in a knot. Behind him was a massive picture of an immortal crane soaring in the blue skies and a white sun.Two men stood on each side beneath him. A total of four men stood before him.They were the family heads of the Zhao, Li, Lu and Zheng families respectively.These four families\u2019 power was more than half of the power held by various industries and businesses in all of Nine Links City.Lu family\u2019s Lu Quanan was one of the four.Wearing a mandarin robe with golden coin and talent motifs sewn onto it and donning a squire\u2019s hat, he was at the moment incessantly pinching the beard on his chin, staring at the Old Master Prefect who sat above them.All five of them were silent, the Prefect included.The head of the Zhao family, Zhao Shide, was a muscular and fit bald old man. His Zhao family commanded all of Nine Links City\u2019s restaurants, brothels, entertainment plazas and casinos. Among the four of them, he had the highest standing.Presently, seeing that no one spoke, he ventured in a thick-skinned manner.\u201cOld Master Song, you asked us to search for that person and that thing. And we did send out men to look for it. It was supposed to be a small matter at first. But now, over ten of our men have gone missing one after another. We\u2019re talking about a matter of life and death here. If you still intend to keep the truth from us under such circumstances, then forgive us for not helping you anymore.\u201dLu Quanan made up his mind to keep his mouth shut. The other two seemed to share the same intention.Prefect Song Duanchi\u2019s brows tightened further as he heaved a long sigh.\u201cThose are orders from above. Even I can\u2019t do anything about it. Moreover, strange things keep popping up one after another these few days, both in and out of the city. I\u2019ve gotten the abbot of Red Lotus Temple to perform rites, but it didn\u2019t help.Also, none of the wandering experts of the pugilistic world whom I\u2019ve engaged have returned. Who knows if they\u2019ve run away, or\u2026 The Wang Villa case from outside the city also remains unresolved till today. I\u2019ve gathered the four of you here to see if you\u2019ve got any good ideas. After all, this is our Nine Links City.\u201dThe trio, including Lu Quanan, kept silent. However, Zhao Shide chuckled coldly.\u201cLet\u2019s put aside the matter of searching for that person. We\u2019ll just leave it on hold. As for the other matter, since Old Master is out of methods, I\u2019ve actually engaged a highly skilled expert to assist in the investigation. As for the compensation, it\u2019s not fair for it to all come from my family, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cSince it\u2019s a highly skilled expert, if he or she can really crack the case, I\u2019ll give him or her the full reward,\u201d the Prefect confirmed first.\u201cMy family will contribute a thousand talents.\u201d\u201cMine as well,\u201dLu Quanan added hurriedly.\u201cMine too,\u201d the last family head jumped onto the bandwagon.\u201cAlright. Looks like the Xu family case is taken care of for now. But as for the Wang Villa case\u2026\u201d the Prefect was troubled again.\u201cWang Villa\u2026 is it the case in which the concubine jumped into the well? Why not just deal with it according to Song laws?\u201d The Li family head asked in a flat voice.\u201cIf only it were that simple. The problem is that we can\u2019t even find that concubine\u2019s corpse. There isn\u2019t even a drop of blood at the bottom of the well, and yet numerous people in the villa swear that they saw the concubine jumping into it with their own eyes. And we did indeed find many footprints beside the well\u2026\u201dThe Prefect shook his head.\u2018What an eventful autumn\u2026\u2019 Lu Quanan exclaimed in his heart at the situation.Recalling the look of terror on the face of his old friend, the deceased Xu family head, his heart was wrenched in pain.***Lu Manor.In the sleeping quarters.Lu Sheng sat cross-legged on his bed, focusing his thoughts and senses. Following the method in the Jade Crane Skill manual, he began imagining an immortal crane spreading its wings, attempting to soar, in his chest. The crane flapped both its wings without stopping, building up strength and momentum, but just could not fly up.After mustering his Qi for a while with his eyes shut, he gradually opened his eyes, retrieved the Jade Crane Skill manual from his chest, opened it and read.On the first page was a hand-drawn sketch of an immortal crane, soaring above the skies with its wings wide open. Its posture, on the verge of shooting up into the skies, radiated a faint oppressive aura.Lu Sheng concentrated momentarily on the sketch, then immediately shut his eyes and continued imagining the immortal crane in his chest.He repeated this thrice.The light streaming in from the window gradually grew dim. Little Qiao had come to call him to dinner several times, but Lu Sheng rejected each time, keeping his door shut tight and remaining seated on his bed.The immortal crane conjured up by his imagination was becoming more and more realistic, coming closer and closer to life.At the moment when dusk descended and the skies turned dark, Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes suddenly opened wide.\u201cHoo\u2026\u201dHe forced out a breath of murky air.Taking a deep breath, he clearly felt a slim line in his chest, as wide as an ant, slowly circle in his chest as it formed a simple oval.This oval spun clockwise at a turtle\u2019s pace \u2013 so slow that it was undetectable unless one felt for it carefully.Lu Sheng relaxed in his fatigue, calling out in his mind without further ado.\u2018Deep Blue.\u2019Immediately, the Modifier screen floated before his eyes.In the dark blue square frame of the Modifier beneath Black Tiger Saber Technique was now added a line of small words.\u201cJade Crane Skill: Uninitiated.\u201d\u2018I gotta hurry.\u2019Lu Sheng hurriedly focused his mind and clicked on the Modify button lest the thread of Qi he sensed disappeared.As the button was pressed, the entire Deep Blue Modifier flashed once.Lu Sheng quickly gathered all his focus on the Jade Crane Skill.\u2018Upgrade one level!\u2019 He thought.The status display of the Jade Crane Skill jumped all of a sudden.From Uninitiated to Initiated in one second.Lu Sheng paused, and felt a small stream appearing in his body, flowing slowly from his chest down to his abdomen.It formed an oval loop between his chest and abdomen, threads of cooling Qi flowing unbroken between them.\u2018I\u2019m initiated now\u2026 looks like it didn\u2019t cause much of a burden to my body.\u2019Lu Sheng thought. Then focusing his concentration again, he imagined the Jade Crane Skill upgrading yet another level.\u201cCough, cough!\u201dSuddenly, he felt a dry itch in his throat and began coughing loudly.An irritating sensation of heat rose from his abdomen and gushed into his heart. Lu Sheng\u2019s throat immediately turned dry with thirst.\u2018Crap, my body\u2019s weakened! The Jade Crane Skill rose too rapidly and hurt my body too. Just, it was not as bad as during the time with Black Tiger Saber Technique.\u2019Lu Sheng relaxed his mind and let the Modifier grow faint and disappear.\u2018So this is inner force?\u2019He stretched out both his legs and got off his bed slowly.Carefully sensing the Jade Crane Skill\u2019s inner Qi flowing cyclically without stopping between his chest and abdomen, Lu Sheng could not help but feel astonished.\u2018It feels as if I\u2019ve got a new line in my body.\u2019Lu Sheng attempted to control the line and discovered that it didn\u2019t seem capable of being channeled elsewhere; it could only remain fixed cycling between his chest and abdomen.As this line of inner Qi flowed in the cycle, he could plainly feel his breathing become much easier and his spirits lift and strengthen.\u2018Initiated in inner force, let me see\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng flipped open the manual and looked at the records in it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0KurisuWritten clearly on the booklet were the words:\u201cThis skill effectively extends longevity, improves blood circulation and nourishes the five viscera to smoothen one\u2019s Qi; effective for recuperating from internal injuries. The more advanced one\u2019s cultivation, the more effective the results.\u201d\u2018Recuperating from internal injuries?\u2019Lu Sheng\u2019s heart skipped a beat.\u201cYoung Master? It\u2019s time to eat. It\u2019s already the height of the Zi hour\u2026\u201dLittle Qiao\u2019s voice drifted in from outside.Lu Sheng warmed up his arms and shoulders. Pushing the door open, he saw Little Qiao sitting alone on a small stool outside the door. Who knew how long she had been waiting for him there.The height of the Zi hour, in other words, the latter half of the Zi hour.According to how they kept time in the Song Dynasty, the timekeepers divided the day into twelve two-hour periods. Each period was split into the beginning and the height portions.Which means, it was currently between 24:00 and 1:00 in the morning..\u201cIt\u2019s already so late?\u201d Lu Sheng gazed towards other courtyards. The usual hustle and bustle these courtyards emitted during the day were now completely quiet.Faint sounds of the gong rang out in the night wind as the night watchman made his rounds outside.\u201cIs there still something to eat now?\u201d Lu Sheng walked towards the kitchen.The Lu Manor\u2019s kitchen was built between the front of the manor and the backyard; to get there, one needed to walk out of the backyard.\u201cI\u2019ve asked the kitchen to leave some food for you, Young Master; there\u2019s a bit of each dish, we just have to heat it up,\u201d Little Qiao said softly as she hurried to Lu Sheng\u2019s side.The two of them walked along the winding corridor, exiting the backyard and taking a left turn into the small kitchen yard.A few tables and chairs were placed in disarray in the kitchen yard, left there especially for the chefs and servants to dine at.Just as the two entered the small yard, they saw a person sitting at the edge of a table, wolfing down Lu Sheng\u2019s dinner.\u201cBig Bro, how come you\u2019re still up so late?\u201d The person eating his dinner lifted her head to reveal a plain yet pretty and innocent face.\u201cQingqing?\u201d Lu Sheng stared in surprise. \u201cWhen did you come back?\u201dSitting down opposite her, he sized Lu Qingqing up as she ate with relish.She was his younger sister \u2013 the daughter of his Second Mother. They were thus of the same father but different mothers. However, Second Mother had very often treated him even better than her own biological daughter; to her, he was like her own son.In the original Lu Sheng\u2019s memory, his feelings towards Second Mother and Lu Qingqing far surpassed those he felt towards his other siblings.\u201cOh, I just got back. I was really hungry so I rushed here! I found a feast laid out on the table, so I thought it was prepared for me.\u201dWith a sword on her back, Lu Qingqing dressed in blue overalls and clearly bound her bosom. If not for her pretty face, it was impossible to tell she was a woman.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come back\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng sighed.\u201cWhy?\u201d Lu Qingqing lowered her bowl, her expression abruptly turning somber. \u201cBrother Xu died from some unknown cause\u2026 just what trouble did Uncle Xu\u2019s family get themselves into? Demons, devils, ghosts and monsters\u2026 what a mess! I just don\u2019t believe in those!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Lu Sheng stared at her.\u201cThe reason why I returned earlier is to look into the real cause of Brother Xu\u2019s death, and to bring the murderer to justice!\u201d Lu Qingqing spoke earnestly, a thread of killing intent flashing in her eyes.Lu Sheng kept silent for a long while as he looked at his Second Sis. A hint of anger rose up on Lu Qingqing\u2019s face.\u201cBig Bro, Brother Xu is dead. Don\u2019t you want to find out the real killer at all?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve looked into it, but there weren\u2019t any leads\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head. \u201cThere were no clues regarding the killer, no trace at all. All the people of the Xu Family, over ten of them in total, died tragically in the middle of the night. Yet there was no wind of it at all.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201d Lu Qingqing stood up. \u201cI\u2019m full. I\u2019ll begin investigating tomorrow. Big Bro, I\u2019m going to rest first,\u201d she said, and walked off in big strides to leave the yard.\u201cLittle Qiao, want to come over to my place?\u201d Along the way, she called out to Little Qiao.Her face gloomy, Little Qiao shook her head. Clearly, talking about the incident of Brother Xu caused her spirits to be dampened.Xu Daoran was gentle and courteous, and had always been kind to them. How could she have even imagined that such a kind-hearted person would perish in an instant?After Lu Qingqing left, Lu Sheng sat down. Once Little Qiao heated up the leftovers, he continued to eat.\u2018It\u2019s been five years since Qingqing left to train in martial arts under Priest Tie Sang, the famed swordsman near Zi Hua City. However, it seems that she has not cultivated inner force.\u2019According to the records in the Jade Crane Skill manual, a special trait of all those who cultivated inner force was a pair of eyes scintillating with charm.The more advanced one\u2019s inner force was, the more spirit and vigor one\u2019s eyes shone with.However, Second Sis\u2019 eyes were dark and gloomy, no different from an average person. Clearly, she was not an inner force cultivator.\u2018Of course. How can inner force cultivators be as common as cabbages on market? But, that really goes to show just how complicated that Duanmu Wan is\u2026\u2019Lu Sheng muttered to himself irresolutely while immersed in his thoughts. Finally, he collected his thoughts, and then began to eat his dinner.***The next morning.Early in the morning, Lu Sheng followed Uncle Zhao and headed towards Chief Constable Zhang Xun\u2019s house.\u201cAlthough Chief Constable Zhang\u2019s Heart-Shattering Palm does not belong to any faction, it has been rumored that it can hold its own against the renowned Iron Sand Palm. Its focus is on penetrative force that can pass through an object and hit a target on its other side. In combat, it can target and hit the enemy\u2019s internal organs directly. It\u2019s extremely powerful.\u201dUncle Zhao and Lu Sheng each rode a horse as they made their way to Zhang Xun\u2019s house. It was located in the Blacksmiths\u2019 District, the area of Nine Links City nearest to the city walls.Mainly the poor and people like craftsmen, blacksmiths and carpenters resided here.Along the way, Lu Sheng saw poor people everywhere, sickly in appearance and with emaciated bodies. Most of the passers-by were also dressed in patched-up clothing.\u201cI\u2019ve occasionally heard of the prowess of the Heart-Shattering Palm since I was young. Just how did Chief Constable Zhang end up in such dire straits? As a yamen military official, he definitely should have more than enough connections and experience to live in a better area, Lu Sheng asked casually.Uncle Zhao shook his head. \u201cHow? It\u2019s all because of the tragedy that year. He exacted vengeance by killing his enemy with his own hands, but ended up with internal injuries that frequently act up. Just the purchase of all sorts of nourishing medicines was enough for him to end up here.\u201dAs they chatted, the two of them soon arrived in front of a small, worn out courtyard.Uncle Zhao got off his horse and knocked onto the door.\u201cWho\u2019s there? Soon, a skinny and weak youth opened the door. Noticing Zhao Dahu, he welcomed them in a surprised tone. \u201cUncle Zhao? Quick, come in, come in!\u201dLu Sheng followed in through the doors. He immediately saw a white-haired elder, sitting in the yard and basking in the sun.\u201cIs that Young Master Lu?\u201dThe elderly got straight to the point as he asked loudly.\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Lu Sheng cupped his fists.\u201cThis old man has received the silver you sent here previously. I can pass down the Heart-Shattering Palm technique to you straightaway, no problem. However, this old man does have a difficult favor to request of you.\u201dThe elder was none other than Chief Constable Zhang Xun, he who once killed without batting an eyelid.\u201cPlease speak, Master Zhang,\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s expression remained the same.\u201cThis old man hopes that Young Master Lu can learn this skill and pass it on to a few more people. This way, my life\u2019s achievements will not be lost,\u201d Zhang Xun\u2019s voice was full of vigor and full of dignity despite his age.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Master Zhang! Junior will do so!\u201d Lu Sheng said resolutely.\u201cGood! Be it training with our swords or fists, it is this bold courage to strive forward that we need, come what may! Without this spirit, even the most powerful stroke is but weak and hollow!\u201d Zhang Xun\u2019s voice was unexpectedly severe.\u201cMy Heart-Shattering Palm and saberplay share some common points. Be it the palm or the saber, you need to be decisive, and imagine yourself in a do-or-die situation. Only then will you be able to explode with the most immense strength and speed! If your heart hesitates, then your strength abates!\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s mind shook as if he suddenly comprehended something.\u201cEssence, Qi and spirit; heart, mind and strength \u2013 combine them and, once they all fit together, focus them on one point. This is the secret to success in both saberplay as well as my Heart-Shattering Palm!\u201d Zhang Xun said sternly.Lu Sheng closed his eyes as he stood there, looking as if he had just gained enlightenment. His hand grasped onto his long-hilted saber on his waist.He had just arrived at the courtyard, and had already taken the first lesson from this former Number One expert of the Nine Links City!\u2018If your heart hesitates, then your strength abates!\u2019These words resounded like thunder in his mind, constantly surging throughout it.It was precisely because he tended to think too much that caused his saber moves to carry a sliver of hesitation.Now that he thought of it, it should be because his resolve was lacking!His level was clearly higher than Uncle Zhao\u2019s; yet, when they actually fought each other, he was less confident than the other. Initially, he had attributed that to his lack of experience.But now, from the looks of it, it was rather his resolve that was lacking, both in mind and heart!A long while later.Lu Sheng cupped his hands into fists as he saluted Zhang Xun.\u201cMany thanks, Master Zhang!\u201d\u201cNo problem. Now, everyone else, get out! I\u2019m going to pass on the key formula of the Heart-Shattering Palm to you!\u201d Zhang Xun\u2019s voice rang out clearly.Uncle Zhao and the youth both gave a small wry smile before leaving the courtyard.An entire day passed.Lu Sheng stayed at Zhang Xun\u2019s house the whole time, memorizing the key formula and practicing moves of the Heart-Shattering Palm. Zhang Xun also readily shared with him his battle experience; he held nothing back.Having been initiated in his inner force skill, Lu Sheng was exuberant in spirit and teeming with strength. He diligently learnt and practiced unceasingly all throughout the day, resting only twice during the whole day.In the evening, he had committed to memory and familiarized himself with the essential aspects of the Heart-Shattering Palm. Only then did he bid Zhang Xun farewell and left.He went to his sleeping quarters the minute he got home and sat down cross-legged.\u2018Deep Blue!\u2019 He commanded wordlessly in his head, causing the screen of the Modifier to once again surface in his mind.After pressing the Modify button, the entire screen flashed violently.Lu Sheng focused his concentration onto the Jade Crane Skill from before.\u2018There shouldn\u2019t be any problems this time round.\u2019Modifying skills by a single stage ensured that it was not too overwhelming and lessened the burden on his body.\u2018Upgrade one level!\u2019Lu Sheng stared intently at the Jade Crane Skill. Soon, the state of the Jade Crane Skill jumped directly from Initiated to Level One.Lu Sheng instantly felt as if all his five viscera and six bowels were on fire; his mouth and tongue felt parched and his face flushed red. [1]He had read in the secret manual that such sensation would occur when one\u2019s inner force was too abundant, causing one\u2019s heart to overheat.He rose hastily to the table, where he had Jadeite Dendrobium tea ready just in case, and began to drink it slowly. [2]The Dendrobium was also known as the Yin Nourishing Fairy Grass, which had extremely potent nourishing effects. The other variant, the Metallic Dendrobium, was the one which was the most often used on earth; here, it was the Jadeite Dendrobium that was most commonly used instead.It was a highly expensive tonic imported from the Central Plains. It just so happened that there was some stock in the family\u2019s pharmacy that he was able to use.Only after drinking three cups of rich Dendrobium tea was Lu Sheng able to feel some warmth ebbing out from his chest.\u2018If it is as recorded in the secret manual, there are only two levels of the Jade Crane Skill, and I was indeed able to sense Qi in just one day. However, it requires a hundred days just to get initiated, and that is for the more gifted ones. To cultivate the first level would require about two to three years. As for the second level, that would require five to ten years.\u2019He placed the teapot back onto the table, retrieving the Dendrobium left on the bottom and stuffing it into his mouth to eat it.\u2018What I just did, is equivalent to two to three years\u2019 worth of hard work. Not bad.\u2019He could distinctly feel the Qi in his chest was slowly becoming easier to sense than previously.If it had been of a hair\u2019s breadth before, then it was now as thick as a single chopstick.Lu Sheng then looked at the other martial art, Heart-Shattering Palm.Currently, this martial art was displayed as Uninitiated, with different sections for the outer and inner force skills. As long as he remembered the moves and the heart formula, then it would be displayed onto the menu of the Modifier screen.As for inner force, he must first be able to sense Qi before he\u2019d able to modify it.Lu Sheng intended to quickly upgrade his Jade Crane Skill to improve his essence, Qi and spirit before modifying the other outer force skills. In this way, the load on his body would be greatly reduced.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0KurisuLu Sheng trained at Chief Constable Zhang Xun\u2019s place for three whole days. He had thoroughly committed the Heart-Shattering Palm to memory.Then, he went to find the other elder.The second teacher recommended by Uncle Zhao was surnamed Du, first name Zhen. He was a top expert in the former Prefect\u2019s yamen, and belonged to the same generation as Chief Constable Zhang Xun.His ninety-nine strokes of the Eighty-Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade were as fast as lightning. A pity that, without rhyme or reason, someone had injured his hand tendons, incapacitating him. Because he never married, he was similarly without children. As a taciturn introvert, he also had no other heirs.Lu Sheng stayed there to learn for a total of four days.Actually, in his eyes, the ninety-nine strokes of the Eighty-Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade paled slightly in comparison to the Black Tiger Saber Technique. However, it was always a good thing to acquire more martial arts skills.Then, he again implored Uncle Zhao to bring him one-by-one to other famous experts within Nine Links City, especially those of the older generation.After receiving his father Lu Quanan\u2019s nod of approval, he was able to use money to pave his way. He was again able to learn from two others: he learnt the Precious Eight Steps and the Double-Horned Blade.Both martial arts were relatively weaker than the Black Tiger Saber Technique. After all, he understood that Black Tiger Saber\u2019s Uncle Zhao was one of the finest experts within Nine Links City. It wasn\u2019t an easy feat for others to reach the same level.For two consecutive months, Lu Sheng persevered and assiduously trained in all sorts of different martial arts. At the same time, he continued to stuff his body with copious amounts of Yin-nourishing and blood-nourishing prescriptions.Ever since he started to practice martial arts, his family had been spending more than a thousand talents a month to sustain his expenditure on herbal tonics. This was an astronomical sum for an average family.It was a good thing that he had his father Lu Quanan\u2019s backing. Otherwise, even a rich young master could not be so unrestrained and audacious in spending money.In the blink of an eye, the summer passed and, with the coming of September, autumn arrived.It had already been three months since Lu Sheng arrived in this world.\u201cBrother Sheng\u2019s been really hardworking these days\u2026\u201dUncle Zhao stroked his moustache, his gaze resting upon Lu Sheng who was currently diligently practicing the Eighty-Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade on the arena.Lu Sheng did not use the Modifier to modify this blade technique. He had been refraining from using the Modifier during this period, relying solely on himself to comprehend it.At the end of the day, the Modifier was an external help. He wanted to see how the martial arts trained by himself fared in comparison to those he attained through the Modifier.Coincidentally, the Eighty-Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade technique was fundamentally not difficult with its simple moves, and thus very suitable for him to train in slowly.\u201cSwoosh! Swish swish swish!\u201dCrisp sounds rang out one by one. The stacks of straw surrounding Lu Sheng were instantly hacked by the blade.Lu Sheng held a small glaive, longer than a meter, with one arm. Swiftly, he flipped the glaive and fastened it behind his back. \u2018Time to call it a day.\u2019\u201cI started training martial arts too late; if I don\u2019t put in some effort, how will I catch up to others?\u201d Lu Sheng replied smilingly after a moment. \u201cI must really thank you, Uncle Zhao, for your help this period.\u201dUncle Zhao waved his hand.\u201cBrother Sheng, I know that you intend to gather the martial arts secret manuals to strengthen the family, but those in Nine Links City who\u2019re willing to impart their martial arts are just these few. It\u2019s very unlikely for the rest to do so. What are your plans from now on?\u201dLu Sheng fell deep in thought momentarily, allowing Little Qiao to wipe off his perspiration as she saw fit with a wet towel.\u201cSince Nine Links City\u2026\u201d\u201cBad news! Bad news!!\u201d Suddenly, a house servant hollered as he hurried over in the direction of the arena, his face white as a sheet.\u201cWhat happened? You\u2019re noisy!\u201dA guard within the manor went forward and chided him. He pulled the servant aside as he questioned him in detail.After he had heard the reply, the guard\u2019s facial expressions also changed somewhat. He hastily ran over to both Lu Sheng and Uncle Zhao.\u201cYoung Master, Second Miss got into a fight with someone, and is now nowhere to be found!\u201d The guard exclaimed very anxiously.\u201cWHAT?!\u201dLu Sheng stood there stupefied.He knew that Lu Qingqing would get into trouble when she got back, but had no idea it would happen so soon. [1]\u201cWhere is she? Whom did she fight with?\u201d Uncle Zhao was solemn as he asked promptly.\u201cOn Flower Willow Street, with a few guards of a merchant who had just entered the city as they were passing by.\u201d\u201cDoes Old Master know of this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but that servant just now received the news just a moment ago. Second Miss\u2019 personal servant girl ran over to relay the info. He then came over to Young Master\u2019 side as fast as possible,\u201d the guard replied quickly.These people were all orphans Lu Quanan bought and cared for from young, nurturing them into adulthood. They were all highly loyal to the Lu Manor.\u201cNice work. There\u2019s no hurry to let Father know about this. I\u2019ll go and take a look first,\u201d Lu Sheng said in a grim voice.\u201cSecond Miss was looking into the tragic case of the Xu Family. How did she end up fighting with a merchant\u2019s guards?\u201d Uncle Zhao asked suspiciously.\u201cWe\u2019ll know after we go take a look,\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s face was calm.They gathered the servants and guards within the manor, chose ten of them and headed straight for Flower Willow Street.Flower Willow Street was a famous red-light district in Nine Links City. Only heavens knew why Lu Qingqing ended up here during her investigation.The horses ran at full pelt the entire way.By the time Lu Sheng arrived, the entire street was in complete disarray. The owners of two stalls near the Lu Family were comforting the peddlers in the vicinity that had suffered collateral damage.\u201cPay for the damages to whomever we should, and apologize to whomever we need to. Don\u2019t let others look down on our Lu Family,\u201d Lu Sheng instructed.\u201cYes!\u201dTen people who came with him replied immediately and dispersed to clean up the mess.As for Lu Sheng and Uncle Zhao, they went over to the sidewalk to search for traces of the fight.\u201cQingqing hadn\u2019t left for a very long time, her temper has always been explosive. To be provoked by gangsters in such a place as this, it\u2019s not at all strange for her to retaliate,\u201d Lu Sheng carefully checked the traces of blood on the floor.There was not much blood, and he wasn\u2019t worried that it was Qingqing\u2019s blood. Given her ability, it was not difficult for her to go up against two people on the level of someone merchants hired as guards.A blotch of dark-red blood stained the greyish-white stone tiles. Under the glare of the sun, it was extra eye-catching.Lu Sheng stooped down, lightly dabbing his finger into the blood and taking a sniff. Instantly, his brows furrowed.\u201cWhat happened? What did you discover?\u201d Uncle Zhao walked over and, just like Lu Sheng, dabbed his fingers into the blood before taking a sniff. \u201cThis is ordinary human blood, nothing strange about it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m puzzled over\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head. \u201cWhat I\u2019m puzzled over is that there is quite a large amount of blood here. Although Qingqing has a bad temper, she is not someone who would seriously wound her opponents. To draw so much blood\u2026 it\u2019s not like her to be so reckless.\u201dAt this time, the guards who were settling matters in the area had also returned.\u201cYoung Master, there\u2019s news. Someone saw Second Miss, armed with a sword, fight with two others and chase them all the way outside the city! Someone else also said that those two she was pursuing were murderers wanted by the authorities, not some merchant\u2019s guards!\u201d\u201cI see,\u201d Lu Sheng nodded. \u201cCome, we\u2019ll go to the city gates to take a look. The nearest gate around here is the West Gate, they should have exited from there.\u201dA crowd of people followed him and swiftly headed for the West Gate.Over ten minutes later, the group arrived at the West Gate. A city guard came to greet one of the house servants; clearly, they knew each other.\u201cSecond Miss Lu has given chase in the direction of the Black Winds Ridge,\u201d the guard provided them with a vital information.Lu Sheng gathered the men to search for her and stepped out of the city. However, he made no more than several steps before Lu Qingqing could be seen in the distance, rushing back in the direction of the city gates. She rode on a horse, lugging with her two men, tied together.As soon as she saw Lu Sheng, Lu Qingqing appeared very pleased.\u201cWhat are you doing rushing over here, Big Bro? Aren\u2019t they just two petty thieves? Don\u2019t you have any faith in my abilities?\u201dShe had changed and dressed up like a heroine, a longword resting within a silver sheath in her hands and a belt with golden trimmings attached to her waist. Her hair was cinched high atop her head, giving her an especially valiant and formidable look.Lu Sheng stood at the city gates and waited for Lu Qinqing to arrive in front of him on her horse. Only when she flipped over and alighted from the horse did he heave a sigh of relief.\u201cDon\u2019t be so reckless in the future.\u201dAlthough he wasn\u2019t the original Lu Sheng, he had experienced Second Mother\u2019s sincere care for him in this period. He wasn\u2019t a cold-blooded person or someone unable to discern who was sincere and who was hypocritical.Because of Second Mother, he also had a slight sense of obligation to care for Lu Qingqing.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Yours truly couldn\u2019t care less about these petty thieves in Nine Links City!\u201d Lu Qingqing said absentmindedly.Lu Sheng looked at the two convicted murderers on the floor, tied together with a rope. Both of their faces were ashen, as if resulting from a severe blood loss. Currently, they were still unconscious and it was difficult to tell if they were even alive.But what was bewildering was that there was a slight hint of a curve at the corners of their mouths; it seemed as if they were\u2026 laughing?Lu Sheng made a mental note regarding this matter.Seeing that Lu Qingqing was unscathed, he did not say anything else. Perhaps he had made a mountain out of a molehill.After giving Lu Qingqing a few more words of advice, he and Uncle Zhao led the rest back to the manor.The life once again went back to its original rhythm.Each day, he woke up and trained saber moves for six hours in the morning. After lunch, he then began working on his footwork and the Heart-Shattering Palm. At night, he returned to his room to practice the Jade Crane Skill.As for the Black Fury Skill, he had decided to stop training in it.Seeing how he repeated this cycle, Uncle Zhao advised him to focus his energy on just one particular skill. However, Lu Sheng had other plans.After he had successfully placed all of the martial arts skills onto the Modifier selection screen, he once again began to upgrade the Jade Crane Skill\u2019s level.In the dead of the night.Lu Sheng lay on his bed, his eyes gradually beginning to open.He sat up ramrod-straight and looked at the paper window. Faint moonlight was streaming through it, leaving a distinct, white patch on the floor of the sleeping quarters.Outside the window, faint snoring sounds of the guard on night duty could be heard.The wind blew fiercely, causing the tall trees within the courtyard to sway with a cacophony of swishing sounds.Lu Sheng slowly sat up cross-legged on his bed.\u2018It\u2019s about time.\u2019He listened intently to the sounds around him, but did not find anything that could be a disturbance to him.\u2018After cultivating for so long, my body\u2019s essence, Qi and spirit are at their pinnacle. Now, it\u2019s about time to upgrade the Jade Crane Skill.\u2019In these few days, Lu Qingqing had been performing heroic feats all around. She caused quite a stir as she went about, nabbing convicted murderers and injuring thieves and robbers.Seeing this, however, Lu Sheng\u2019s heart was always troubled by an inexplicable sense of urgency. Particularly, in the past days, he heard from Master Zhang Xun that, when he was still the Chief Constable, he had also faced a few strange cases. Although in the end these cases were left unresolved, they all left a deep impression on him.Collecting his thoughts, Lu Sheng called out in his mind. \u2018Deep Blue.\u2019Immediately, a light-blue screen appeared in front of him.With great familiarity, he pressed onto the Modify button and then focused all his concentration onto the selection for Jade Crane Skill.\u2018Upgrade one level!\u2019The selection panel instantly jumped from the first level to the second, like a walk in the park.A feeling as if the insides of his body were about to be hollowed out violently surged through him. It was as if, in a short amount of time, he had excessively indulged in debauchery.His head buzzed and his vision blurred as a dizzy spell hit him. The same sense of a hot flush from before flooded him again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Good thing I\u2019ve been focusing on nourishing Yin during this period. This second level is also the highest level of the Jade Crane Skill; an average person would need five years to attain it. I\u2019ve cut down five years to such a short time, so naturally, the stress on my body is a lot bigger than when I was becoming initiated in the skill.\u2019He felt out the state of his body\u2019s interior in detail.Although weak, it was actually a lot better than before. Looks like him nursing his health recently had indeed been effective.\u201cHOO\u2026\u201d He exhaled at length.Lu Sheng could feel the circle of inner Qi within his chest thickening from the width of a chopstick to that of nine chopsticks.Qi that was the width of nine chopsticks combined together was quite a lot thicker than it was previously. The second level of the Jade Crane Skill clearly felt different from before.Lu Sheng felt highly invigorated as he breathed in and out. His reaction speed was also a lot faster than usual.\u2018According to the records on the second level of Jade Crane Skill, it should be able to extend longevity and help staunch bleeding faster. I\u2019ll test the effect of the inner force tomorrow, then. Also, I should get in touch with Duanmu Wan and see if I can get any new inner force skills from her.\u2019Since the Jade Crane Skill was authentic, then the other inner force manuals might also be real. He wanted to try and see what would happen if he cultivated in several different inner force skills at the same time.Logically, as long as the inner force skills were not in conflict with each other, then it should be possible to combine them.Having thought that, Lu Sheng once again lay on his bed to rest.However, just as he lay down, he could hear faint footsteps from beyond the courtyard, as if someone was leaving for a journey.Listening to the rhythm, it sounded very much like steps of Lu Qingqing.Lu Sheng shook his head and paid it no heed. In this period, Lu Qingqing left the house in the middle of the night almost every few days to gallivant around the city.Who knew what leads she had found.Initially, he had even tailed her carefully for a stretch, but then realized that his footwork was way incomparable to that of Lu Qingqing\u2019s. He had lost her after just a moment, and then subsequently decided not to waste his energy.Early next morning, Lu Sheng carried the silver notes that he had prepared and headed straight for the Thousand Blessings Inn, where Duanmu Wan was staying.\u201cWhat? She\u2019s already checked out?\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s eyebrows furrowed as he stared at the innkeeper.\u201cWhen was that?\u201d\u201cRoughly half a month ago, Miss Duanmu was invited by a few young masters to sightsee at Red Lotus Temple. After that, she sent somebody to come back to check out.\u201dThe innkeeper was also very smitten with Duanmu Wan.After all, she was a natural beauty. Furthermore, many young masters had come round to pursue her, and she herself spent money like sailor on a shore leave. Naturally, all these left a very deep impression on him.\u201cRed Lotus Temple\u2026\u201dLu Sheng frowned. His intuition told him that, most likely, Duanmu Wan was not at Red Lotus Temple.It was but a mere excuse for her to suddenly check out.\u201cThen forget it.\u201dWaving a folding fan in hand, he left the inn. His two bodyguards kept watch outside the door.\u201cHow did it go, Young Master? Did you find Miss Duanmu?\u201d The guard Little Song interacted with Lu Sheng very much on a day-to-day basis; he also helped Lu Sheng clean up all sorts of venues for him to train martial arts. Occasionally, he would even train alongside Lu Sheng on the arena; his martial arts skills were still passable.\u201cNope, she\u2019s left,\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head.\u201cThen where are we headed now?\u201d\u201cWhere? Back to the Manor.\u201dHaving failed to obtain any secret manuals, Lu Sheng\u2019s mood was sour.The three of them boarded a horse carriage and made their way back straight to the Lu Manor. Just as they approached the front of the residence, they saw that another yellow horse carriage had already stopped in front of the main entrance.Carved on the side of the horse carriage was the big character \u201cZhang \u5f20\u201d.\u201cZhang Family?\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s face flickered. A long time has passed since a member of the Zhang Family was murdered; they had finally made their way here.But he was not afraid. He got Little Song and the rest to leave, before entering via the main entrance alone.Looking in from the main entrance, he was just able to see into the Main Hall. Currently, Lu Quanan, accompanied by another martial artist, was attending to someone from the Zhang Family.The Zhang Family had only sent one person over.It was a man of roughly thirty or so years of age, with narrow eyes and thick brows.\u201c\u2026 How could my son have done such a thing, the Zhang Family must have made a mistake!\u201d Lu Quanan sat on the host seat, his face a picture of calmness.\u201cQuite a few people witnessed it at that time! How could it be false?!\u201dThat man boiled with anger.\u201cI don\u2019t care how powerful your Zhang Family is in Zi Hua City, this is Nine Links City, not your Zi Hua! Your Zhang Family may be strong, but my Lu Family is no pushover! If you continue to frame us, don\u2019t blame me, Lu Quanan, for being unkind!\u201d Lu Quanan said coldly.The Zhang Family man was trembling all over from his rage. He was speechless as he pointed his finger at Lu Quanan.\u201cFine, fine, fine!!! The Lu Family head really has guts. I will definitely transmit your message, word for word, back to Family Head Song Xi! Goodbye!\u201dHe turned around and strode off.Halfway to the carriage, he met Lu Sheng but did not recognize him. He continued to angrily storm out of the manor.Lu Sheng was not surprised. Given the Song Dynasty\u2019s weakened state in this time, the land was highly divided. Moreover, they were far away in the North, where city heads and local powers were overlords in the land.Even in the Central Plains, big families like the Lu Family largely paid lip service to the government, opposing it inwardly while showing outward devotion. It had even led to quite a number of scuffles.This Zhang Family actually dared to come up here to interrogate them and pursue matters! Did they think they were in their own Zi Hua City?!The man brushed past Lu Sheng, furiously stormed into the horse carriage and left.Lu Sheng walked into the Main Hall and saw his father Lu Quanan seated on the chair, his face nonplussed.\u201cDad, finished settling your business?\u201d He asked lightly, signaling to the surrounding guards for them to leave as he wished to speak alone with his Dad.Lu Quanan sighed. Seeing that it was Lu Sheng, he could not help but smile a little. \u201cLittle Sheng, you have to look after your younger sister more, don\u2019t let her run around the city all day.\u201d\u201cI am not able to control her,\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head, a bitter smile on his face. \u201cDad, the thing that the higher ups wanted us to find \u2013 has it been found? So, is it a person or a thing that they\u2019re looking for?\u201d\u201cIt could be a thing, and could also be a person. It\u2019s hard to say for sure!\u201d Lu Quanan shook his head, deliberately keeping his voice low.\u201cCurrently, the Prefect is having a headache because of the Xu Family case and the Wang Villa well incident beyond the city. Especially the latter\u2014so many constables weren\u2019t able to find any leads, so what could your younger sister achieve by herself? Get her to stay at home and behave herself.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s gone to investigate the Wang Villa case?\u201d Lu Sheng was shocked.\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? The yamen\u2019s constables even saw that girl Qingqing at the Wang Villa. Every two to three days, she\u2019d pick up some fugitives or suspects and send them to the yamen. Almost everyone there knows her by now,\u201d Lu Quanan said helplessly.\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng frowned. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy lately gathering martial arts skills, and haven\u2019t had the time to look after her.\u201d\u201cGathering martial arts skills\u2026 you\u2019ve already spent close to five thousand talents on that. How\u2019s the progress?\u201d Lu Quanan asked casually.\u201cI\u2019ve already collected quite a number. I\u2019ll gather and organize them into a scripture library at home. That way, it\u2019ll be a lot easier for our Lu Family to grow some experts,\u201d Lu Sheng said seriously.\u201cI have somewhat guessed what you intend to do. In these troubled and chaotic times, it\u2019s not enough to just rely on the ten over of us in the family. We need to train more experts of our own. Which was also why I\u2019ve given you my unconditional support ever since I heard that you\u2019re gathering martial arts,\u201d Lu Quanan was grim as he spoke.\u201cWe\u2019ve a total of eighty-six servant guards in the family that we can deploy at any time. However, because we need to defend our manor, the actual number that we can deploy is just about forty or so,\u201d Lu Sheng calculated for a moment. \u201cThese forty people are hardly even enough to look after the safety of our Lu Family\u2019s thirteen small villas and sixteen shop-houses outside.\u201cOf course dad knows this, but\u2026 trustworthy people are really hard to come by\u2026\u201d Lu Quanan sighed.\u201cWhat about adopting orphans? There are quite a few street urchins within the city, right?\u201d Lu Sheng suggested.\u201cWell\u2026 At the end of the day, we\u2019ve got to consider what the other families will think\u2026\u201d Lu Quanan hesitated.\u201cWe\u2019re short-handed to begin with, so why do we need to be concerned about the other families? Can\u2019t we just proceed under the table?\u201d Lu Sheng argued.\u201cThis is a sensitive issue, one where the slightest move has huge repercussions. If the other families find out, they will definitely reprimand our Lu Family for being ambitious and too high-profile,\u201d Lu Quanan shook his head lightly.Lu Sheng tried to persuade him some more, but to no avail.In his heart, he knew that Lu Quanan was no longer full of vigor like his younger self. In those days, he was without a penny and did not have people who depended on him that he would have to worry about. Therefore, he was unwavering and bold in his decisions, and was able to build up an incredible estate for the Lu Family.Now, though\u2026 he hesitated and shilly-shallied back and forth about matters.Lu Sheng was able to see that the fact that Lu Quanan supported his gathering of martial arts was because he himself also had the mind to expand.However, when the rubber meets the road, he was full of uncertainty and of two minds about matters.After saying a bit more, Lu Sheng stopped trying to persuade him, merely mentioning about the health of some of those in the family. After that, he took his leave.Standing alone in the Main Hall, Lu Quanan\u2019s brow was deeply furrowed, as hesitant as he was earlier.Lu Sheng, on the other hand, had already decided not to rely on his old dad anymore. In this chaotic world, if he were not strong enough, then others would definitely see him as prey sooner or later.He left the Main Hall and went ahead to the arena to continue practicing martial arts.After he had achieved the peak of the Jade Crane Skill, he was full of spirit and vigor all throughout the day. Even though he busied himself from dawn to dusk, he did not feel too drained.When he sensed a bit of fatigue, he would sit down to rest for just a moment before his body would feel every bit as alive as a dragon or a tiger and he would be able to continue working for hours at a stretch.On the arena, he trained his saber skills all the way till evening.Only then, with his entire body drenched in perspiration, he went to shower and rushed to have his dinner.At dinner, Lu Quanan, Second Mother and Lu Sheng sat at one table, while the rest of the relatives sat by themselves at another big table.Such was the custom. Lu Quanan was the household head, Lu Sheng was the future household head, and Second Mother was extremely close to both Lu Quanan and Lu Sheng. She was also in charge of the day-to-day matters of the female servants and maids in the back yard.These three people thus enjoyed the three highest positions in the entire Lu Family.Only after them came Third Mother, Fourth Mother, Fifth mother, Lu Qingqing, Lu Yingying, Lu Chenxin and others in the family.Although the Lu Family was a first-generation upstart family, they modeled themselves after the customs of the other influential and great households in many areas.For example, one of those practices was not to speak when eating and not to converse when sleeping.People ate around two big tables, with only the sound of chopsticks hitting bowls ringing out occasionally. Besides that, it was a state of utter silence.\u201cLittle Sheng.\u201dLu Quanan, who almost never spoke at the dining table, suddenly opened his mouth.Once he did, the whole family paused eating to listen. That was also part of the etiquette. After all, if it weren\u2019t a highly important matter, he usually would not speak at the dining table.\u201cYes, Dad?\u201dLu Sheng put down his chopsticks and looked at Lu Quanan.\u201cYou said that you couldn\u2019t gather any more martial arts in Nine Links City. Do you want to make a trip to Mountain Edge City?\u201d Lu Quanan asked seriously.\u201cMountain Edge City?\u201dLu Sheng was shocked. He had not thought that his old dad actually wanted him to leave Nine Links City.\u201cYea.\u201d Lu Quanan nodded. \u201cI have an old friend there. His letter a few days back mentioned that there are famed experts from the Central Plains currently in Mountain Edge City who are opening their doors to impart their skills. If you are willing, you can make a trip there. Who knows, you might be able to bring back one or two sets of truly remarkable martial arts from the Central Plains.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Travelling to Mountain Edge City, which was far more prosperous than Nine Links City, wasn\u2019t such a bad idea for him either.\u201cMight as well. I\u2019ll go and come back quickly. If I really can learn something from those famed experts, I\u2019ll send someone back with a letter instead,\u201d Lu Sheng thought for a moment and agreed.Mountain Edge City was a great distance away from Nine Links City; it was twice as far as Zi Hua City.Even with horses running at full pelt, it would still take two days and one night to reach it, not to mention travelling on a carriage.After Lu Sheng gave his assent, he spent several days hiding at home to practice martial arts and build up his energy reserves.Meanwhile, Lu Qingqing continued to venture out every day as per usual. News of her capturing so-and-so would spread every now and then.Lu Sheng couldn\u2019t keep a leash on her. Neither could anyone else in the Manor. Second Mother, too, could not help but give up after her words fell on deaf ears.After resting for several days, Lu Sheng prepared to upgrade the few martial arts he had acquired lately.Given his strong foundations in Black Tiger Saber Technique and Jade Crane Skill, he quickly used the Modifier to master Heart-Shattering Palm, modifying it to Level 3 and achieving full mastery of it.He left the rest of the skills untouched, intending to modify them after he thoroughly recovered from his loss of blood and Qi.As for Eighty-Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade, he intended to practice it slowly on his own as a point of comparison with the other skills.This cycle repeated itself almost till the date of his setting off when another strange event occurred in the city.A few hunters who lived in the vicinity of the city had mysteriously vanished on Wan Qing Festival.Just a few days ago, some people had seen them bring fox fur and other wildlife products into the city to peddle. Then, all traces of them were wiped off the surface of the earth.They had vanished within Nine Links City, but the incident was noticed only after their families reported them missing to the authorities.What was crucial, one of the hunters was the cousin of a senior constable in the yamen. That\u2019s what prevented the case from being handled like other similar cases.It seemed like a simple case on the surface, but the moment investigation began, something fishy cropped up.Those hunters had taken only one route from beginning to end, disappearing on the street near the Goldfish Restaurant.Not a single soul had seen them along the way.So, the constables hurried to investigate along the street near the Goldfish Restaurant.But that place had just been on fire and was now empty. Why would these hunters who came peddling head in that direction?As Lu Sheng puzzled over this, Little Qiao ran over in panic and told him that Lu Qingqing had headed towards the street near Goldfish Restaurant all by herself at midnight.It was now bright as day but she was still nowhere to be seen!Lu Sheng\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He knew that something had happened to her.\u201cWhen exactly did Qingqing head there?\u201d He quickly asked.\u201cNot sure, but it should be during the Chou hour [1] after midnight. Usually Second Young Miss would return before dawn. But this time, she did not, and her servant Little Red told me that Young Miss had instructed her to prepare hot water in her room for her to bathe in.In the end, she waited for a long time but there was no sight of Young Miss, so she panicked!\u201d Little Qiao swiftly replied.Lu Sheng was just taking a stroll and resting in the garden. It was his method of relaxation before practicing saberplay.Who would have expected such a thing to happen at this time?\u201cGo at once to inform Uncle Zhao and the family head, I\u2019ll head over there first to take a look!\u201d\u201cLittle Eight had already led some men there to check out the situation. He was the one who sent news of Young Miss\u2019 disappearance!\u201d Little Qiao hurriedly added.\u201cLittle Eight\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes narrowed. He remembered he was the manor guard. \u201cGot it.\u201dSwiftly, he put on an outer coat, equipped himself with the standard-issue long saber from the house, led a horse out from the stable and then rushed towards Goldfish Restaurant without further ado.The entire Lu Manor, from top to bottom, was alarmed. Lu Quanan immediately gave the order for Uncle Zhao to lead his men towards the Goldfish Restaurant. Simultaneously, he sent men to report the case to the authorities at the prefectural yamen.A massive network of manpower and connections rapidly extended itself.The first task on hand was to determine if Lu Qingqing had really gone missing instead of merely falling out of the radar for a short time.\u201cJia!\u201d [2]Lu Sheng rode the horse hard, flying along the cold morning streets that were relatively empty at this hour of the day, allowing him to rush forward at great speed.If this was at any other time, even he could not avoid blame for riding so furiously on the busy streets.But this was no ordinary situation.Little Eight\u2019s message that Lu Qingqing had gone missing was but a fuse that ignited Lu Sheng\u2019s nervousness. What really caused his grave concern were the strange happenings that he had run into along the street near the Goldfish Restaurant previously.The Yellow Speckled Horse soon arrived at the entrance to the Goldfish Restaurant. [3]The restaurant\u2019s doors were locked tight. The sky had just barely lit up and it was not yet daylight-bright.The street on the side of the restaurant was a patch of soot and mess.The few wooden houses which were being demolished were torn down only halfway due to the fire. The remaining half now mixed with the collapsed rubble, appearing more desolate than usual.Lu Sheng jumped down from the horse and walked onto the charred street.\u201cKA-CHA\u2026\u201dA crisp sound came from something which he stepped on with his leather shoes.Lu Sheng reached out to grab onto his saber hilt. Thanks to the two real-life combat situations he experienced, he was now much more composed than before.Light scintillated in his eyes as he surveyed the surroundings. Before long, he noticed something out of sorts.A deep sword mark was carved into a wooden beam in front of the wooden houses in the middle section of the charred street.Messy footprints were on the ground, and fresh black soil could even be seen in them.Lu Sheng reached out to touch the sword marks on the wooden beam. The wooden beam, charred and black on the outside, was pale-yellow on the inside \u2013 it was not thoroughly burnt.The sword mark had just hacked open the charred surface, revealing the pale wood texture within.\u201cShould be nearby.\u201dHe slowly unsheathed his saber and carried it into the house, blade pointing downwards.The ceiling of the wooden house had been thoroughly consumed by the fire. As Lu Sheng walked through the door, he was greeted with a mess of charred furniture, bundles of burnt cloth and some melted god-knows-what.Barely a few steps into the house, Lu Sheng discovered another sword mark.A charred wooden table was collapsed on its side. Two deep sword marks were carved into its edge and even some steel shards were left on it.\u201cWhat great strength.\u201dLu Sheng pinched one of the shards between his fingers, surmising it to have come from the steel longsword carried by his second sister Lu Qingqing.He bowed his head to look at the footprints, then hastened towards the backyard of the house.Stepping through the house, he entered the backyard.In a gap in the backyard wall, a one-eyed muscular man with messy hair wearing a brown leather armor and carrying a thick-backed broad saber was presently cursing and mumbling to himself as he went on sticking something to the wall.\u201cWho\u2019s there!?\u201dHe immediately sensed Lu Sheng as he entered the backyard and stared at him ferociously.\u201cWho\u2019s there? I want to ask you, who the hell are you?\u201dLu Sheng sized him up in an instant.The man was almost 1.9 meters tall, and muscles bulged like rats all over his body. Coupled with the silver thick-backed broad saber, still stained with traces of blood, a savage and beastly aura emanated off him.\u201cMe?\u201d The man chuckled and tossed away the paper in his hand.\u201cLooks like you\u2019re that brat girl\u2019s family? That brat actually dared to kill two of my disciples. So, big bro and I captured her. Too bad you\u2019re too late. That brat girl has been sent back to the stronghold by my big bro for his enjoyment.\u201d\u201cBrat girl?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes grew dark. \u201cSeeing your mannerism, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not just a nobody. I bet you\u2019ve heard of my Lu family\u2019s name in Nine Links City too. Why don\u2019t you name a price? Let\u2019s talk it out!\u201d\u201cTalk your ass! Are you the only one here, brat from the Lu family?\u201d The man laughed coldly as he stared at Lu Sheng.\u201cMy men are behind,\u201d Lu Sheng didn\u2019t bother to hide that fact. He was facing a seasoned opponent and lying to him was probably futile. So, he might as well speak the truth.\u201cYou\u2019re all alone and yet dared to come all the way here\u2026 you\u2019ve got guts!\u201d The man chuckled.\u201cNumber Two, Number Three, take him down. Let the Lu family pay a ransom for his life!\u201dRight after his voice fell, two men jumped inside through another gap in the wall, both in brown leather armor. One of them carried a long-hilted axe while the other a Qi Mei Staff. [4]\u201cJust one little brat, I can handle him alone. Godpa, why did you call both of us out?\u201d One of them complained. [5]\u201cWhoever arrests him first will get the credit!\u201d The man laughed aloud.Hearing that, both of them smiled and stared at Lu Sheng as if he were their prey.\u201cHeheheh, what a handsome little boy. He\u2019ll make a nice pair together with that brat girl. It\u2019s not a bad idea to take turns playing with both of them,\u201d Number Two stared lustfully at Lu Sheng\u2019s lower body.\u201cPlay my ass! If anybody\u2019s gonna play with him, it\u2019s godpa first!\u201d Number Three spat into his palms.\u201cBreak both his legs, but don\u2019t draw too much blood. Otherwise it looks ugly and spoils the mood. That previous one\u2026 you hacked off his right arm with your axe and blood splurted everywhere\u2026 his body came apart when we did him!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s none of my business! Didn\u2019t you whack that guy on his back with your staff? When it was our turn, he was almost dead!\u201d Number Two argued in defense.These two were twin brothers who were blessed with muscular constitution. Once, by chance, they fell under the tutelage of Lin brothers\u2014Phantom Head Blade and Severed Head Blade of Nine Links City and Black Winds Ridge.Severed Head Blade Lin Hongshui happened to be none other than the man carrying the thick-backed broad saber.Phantom Head Blade\u2014Lin Shuanghuo\u2014and Severed Head Blade\u2014Lin Hongshui\u2014were fugitives who had committed murder in Nine Links City over a decade ago. At that time, both of them had slaughtered two merchant troupes in one night and fled with copious amounts of silver and jewelry.The secret arts that both of them possessed were two sets of Wind-Rippling Saber Techniques, savage in might. Both wielded astonishingly heavy broad sabers.The older among them, Phantom Head Blade Lin Shuanghuo, had set the record of cleaving a live person into two clean halves with one saber stroke during pursuit by constables.This was the first time Lu Sheng faced off squarely with others. Three others at the same time, in fact.He lifted his long saber and looked towards the approaching Number Two and Number Three.\u2018Let me test the waters first with a stroke. I\u2019m outnumbered\u2026 if it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll retreat first.\u2019He was a little worried. After all, he had no clear idea of how strong he was right now since he lacked any basis for comparison.Hence, he was rather careful.Lu Sheng used neither Black Tiger Saber Technique nor Heart-Shattering Palm.Rather, he used Eighty-Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade, which he had been routinely practicing by himself. He certainly couldn\u2019t reveal all his cards right from the start.Grasping the saber hilt a trifle loosely, he gazed towards Number Two.\u201cCome!\u201d Number Two\u2019s mouth formed a grin as he waved his axe and pointed at his own head.\u201cLittle brat\u2019s even got the looks of an expert. Hack here! Here! Your grandpa here will stay still and let you\u2026\u201d\u201cCHI!!\u201dA silver light flashed across in that moment.The long saber in Lu Sheng\u2019s hands had turned into an agile swallow, leaping across the distance of several meters in a second and slashing horizontally above Number Two\u2019s body in one stroke.\u201cSPLAT!\u201dA human head instantly flew up in the air.Blood splattered all over.And, the entire yard fell into a deathly silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, the smile on his face was filled with savagery.\u201cYet another who has come looking for\u2026\u201d\u201cCHI!\u201dLight flashed as it was deflected off the saber. This time it was Number Three who was the target.Lu Sheng\u2019s figure flashed in front of Number Three. Fresh blood splurted out again.Number Three\u2019s head was now gone as well. It rolled across the ground before coming to a stop by a pile of charred ashes.Lu Sheng shook the blood off his saber blade.A frenzy of ecstasy arose in his heart.\u2018This is what it feels like to take a life. This is what it means to be a saber warrior! As the legends go\u2026 \u201cat the first word of discord, scores are settled by the saber\u201d!\u2019He gripped the long saber tightly. This ordinary silver-white long saber in his hand, with only a blade the length of a forearm, was like his closest comrade.A faint and strange feeling gushed up in his heart. All of a sudden, he felt as if he was personally being immersed in and experiencing all the wuxia novels that he had read in the past.An indescribable passion burned in the depths of his heart.\u201cCome! Either kill me, or end up like the two pieces of trash on the ground.\u201dLu Sheng liked this feeling. His eyes red, he licked his dry lips as he approached Lin Hongshui step by step.\u201cYou brat!!\u201dLin Hongshui burst into rage as his expression changed into a furious one.Gripping his thick-backed broad saber with both his hands, he strode towards Lu Sheng.\u201cCHI!\u201dA silver swallow appeared suddenly again as Lu Sheng\u2019s saber struck forward.Despite his Eighty-Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade being only at the Initiated level, it displayed considerable might when employed with Lu Sheng\u2019s mastery of the way of the saber, which had come from his training in the Black Tiger Saber Technique.\u201cDANG!\u201dHowever, this stroke was blocked by Lin Hongshui with a lift of his arm.\u201cI recognize this strike\u2026 Swallows Skirting the Water\u2026 so it\u2019s Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade\u2026\u201d he sneered viciously. \u201cIn those days, I almost hacked the original master of this saber technique to death, so it\u2019ll be easy to get rid of a little ass-brat like you!\u201dHe added some force, pushing Lu Sheng\u2019s long saber away.The broad saber\u2019s blade flipped and slashed diagonally upwards with extreme force and velocity.This stroke, Water-Splitting Move of Wind-Rippling Saber Technique, was one of his favorite trademark opening moves. Each time he used it, his opponent would either have to dodge or be forced to face him head-on.Lu Sheng leapt aside, dodging the broad saber. He executed Eighty Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade at full strength with the long saber in his hand, clashing against his opponent.The battle between the two escalated to a frenzy in the middle of the backyard.Lin Hongshui\u2019s saber strokes came thick and heavy like hammer strokes, full of extreme force. Whenever Lu Sheng came into contact with one, his arm would turn numb.But Lu Sheng\u2019s saber strokes came quicker and displayed superior stamina, often striking along the sides of his opponent\u2019s strokes or parrying them aside with Eighty Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade.Both actually struck with immense speed, incomparably quicker than Number Two and Number Three.But for both of them, saberplay at this speed merely fell under normal conditions.In one breath, Lu Sheng continuously executed the ten over moves of Eighty Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade in full, yet he still failed to gain the upper hand.Lin Hongshui, on the other hand, remained as energetic as a tiger; his moves were still astonishingly strong.\u201cDANG, DANG!\u201dBoth sabers collided against each other twice in a row once again.Lu Sheng\u2019s foot twisted a trifle carelessly as he stepped onto a fragile plank of wood, resulting in him losing his balance.Lin Hongshui\u2019s eyes widened and his broad saber immediately slashed downwards with full might before him.\u201cGo and die!!!\u201dHe would cleave this terrible brat into two halves there and then! How dare he kill Number Two and Number Three right in front of him?If he left this score unsettled, who would still dare to follow him in the future!?The broad saber vibrated eccentrically as it slashed down towards Lu Sheng\u2019s head viciously.The core of Wind-Rippling Saber Technique\u2019s mantra was precisely to significantly amplify the strength of broad saber strokes through a unique method of employing force.This astonishingly bolstered the strength of Lin Hongshui\u2019s saber strokes, which were already shockingly powerful to begin with.The broad saber fell squarely towards Lu Sheng\u2019s head.\u201cHOO!\u201dRight in that instant, Lu Sheng straightened his body and steadied himself in a second. The long saber in his hand vibrated at extreme speed, emitting a vague roar without warning.\u201cROAR!!!\u201dIt was a tiger\u2019s roar!Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes were dyed mildly red as he executed Tiger Kill of Black Tiger Saber Technique.Carrying powerful vibration and explosive force, the saber blade slashed towards Lin Hongshui\u2019s saber-wielding arms. The speed of this stroke was far swifter and more vicious than that of the broad saber!\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!!!\u201d An enraged roar sounded out from behind the gap in the wall all of a sudden.In the blink of an eye, a ball-like black shadow shot forward and struck the side of Lu Sheng\u2019s long saber.\u201cDANG!\u201dIt was a piece of ashen stone.A second muscular man, who was carrying a thick-backed broad saber, leapt into the yard.This man\u2019s face was sporting two intersecting scars which stretched from the forehead to the chin, giving him an extraordinarily savage look.\u201cBig bro!!\u201dEarlier, Lin Hongshui\u2019s reaction was delayed by a bit due to the tremor induced by Black Tiger Saber Technique\u2019s tiger roar; he nearly had both his arms lopped off by Lu Sheng.Now, he hurriedly withdrew his saber, giant beads of cold sweat breaking out on his face; he was clearly terrified.\u201cThis brat is using Black Tiger Saber Technique; he\u2019s not easy to deal with! There are more people coming. We\u2019ll take him down together!\u201d Lin Shuanghuo said severely as he glanced at the two corpses beneath him.\u201cAlright!\u201dThe two brothers split up and charged towards Lu Sheng simultaneously.Lu Sheng remained unfazed, executing Black Tiger Saber Technique\u2019s Tiger Might. The strength of the saber stroke was now much heavier than that of Eighty Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade.The might of Black Tiger Saber Technique at the level of full mastery was astonishing. Each stroke he made was one step earlier than either of theirs, slashing towards vital areas and thus forcing them to be on the defensive.In the short span of a few breaths, he had continuously executed Tiger Might seventeen times!\u201cCHI CHI CHI CHI!\u201dShouts and yells rang out back and forth across the entire yard. Unexpectedly, the combined might of both brothers was merely enough to reach a draw against Lu Sheng!Never once did they have a chance to execute their saber strokes to the full; each time they were halfway in motion, they would be forced to retreat in defense.The intense battle carried on for the duration of half a joss stick. Lin Shuanghuo had run out of patience. Exploiting an opportunity while his younger brother hung on temporarily, he took a step back, took out a paper sachet from his chest and hurled it towards Lu Sheng\u2019s face.\u201cJust die!!!\u201d\u201cPoof!\u201dThe paper sachet was hacked into pieces by Lu Sheng\u2019s saber, scattering large amounts of ash within.Shocked, Lu Sheng quickly shut his eyes tightly.Without time for further thoughts, he executed the final Tiger Roar madly.\u201cROAR!!!\u201dYet another tiger\u2019s roar rang out.\u201cDANG, DANG!\u201dThis time, Lu Sheng\u2019s long saber could no longer avoid the two broad sabers, colliding head-on against them.\u201cKA-CHA!\u201dThe long saber broke apart, its blade spinning to the side before stabbing into the ground.However, as it was the most powerful move of Black Tiger Saber Technique, the strength and speed of Tiger Roar was not to be taken lightly.The broad sabers, too, were shaken in Lin Hongshui and his brother\u2019s hands as they loosened their grip.\u201cNow let\u2019s see what you\u2019ll block our attacks with! Go and die!! Hahaha!\u201dLin Shuanghuo laughed manically. A saber warrior without his saber was essentially a lamb ready to slaughter. The gap in strength was extremely wide.He was about to tighten the grip on his saber to finish Lu Sheng off.\u201cBOOM BOOM!\u201dJust then, two low and deep palm strike sounds rang out.Lin Shuanghuo\u2019s eyes opened only to see Lu Sheng close by all of a sudden. Both his palms slammed into his younger brother Lin Hongshui\u2019s chest one after another, lightning-quick.The broad saber in Lin Hongshui\u2019s hand dropped to the ground with a clang.He fell two steps backwards in disbelief, clutching his chest and unable to speak.\u201cBig\u2026 Big Bro\u2026 get\u2026out!\u201d\u201cPUUUU!\u201dLin Hongshui spat out a mouthful of blood and collapsed backwards.At this moment, Lu Sheng had already entered a strange state of maniacal frenzy.After killing Lin Hongshui, he charged towards Lin Shuanghuo in a flash using Heart-Shattering Palm\u2019s movement steps.As if he had just awoken from a dream, Lin Shuanghuo roared in rage, intending to block his advance with his saber.But he was too late.His younger brother\u2019s death had left him stunned for an instant. Just that moment\u2019s delay was sufficient for Lu Sheng to come too close for his comfort.\u201cBOOM, BOOM, BOOM!!!\u201dWith a series of three palm strikes, Lu Sheng\u2019s palms struck Lin Shuanghuo in his chest and abdomen thrice like a streak of lightning.The Heart-Shattering Palm\u2019s signature penetrative force went through the skin and muscles and straight to the organs.Lin Shuanghuo\u2019s face turned beetroot red. He retreated several steps, then collapsed onto his knees.He glared at Lu Sheng unyieldingly and opened his mouth to speak. However, blood kept gushing out of his mouth, stopping his words as he choked.\u201cPUUUU!!!\u201dLin Shuanghuo collapsed stiffly forward. No sound was heard from him again.Lu Sheng chuckled twice to himself.\u2018Two Strength-Proficiency experts\u2026 probably they\u2019re Phantom Head Blade and Severed Head Blade that Uncle Zhao had hunted when he was young. To think that they\u2019d die in my hands today\u2026\u2019Staring at the four corpses on the ground, his heart was momentarily washed over by a wave of ecstasy as Qi and blood surged all over within him.\u2018Could it be that this is the level of Intent-Proficiency that Uncle Zhao mentioned? As well as the martial arts intent that Master Zhang Xun advised me about previously?\u2019If Strength-Proficiency was the level of controlling and harnessing the entire body\u2019s force and strength, then Intent-Proficiency was the use of sight, intent, sound and other means to attack the enemy on multiple fronts.At the same time, the Intent-Proficiency level gave one a stronger command of one\u2019s own physical force than the Strength-Proficiency level.After all, how could the muscles in the human body be so easy to thoroughly master?Lu Sheng remembered that someone on Earth had once researched and discovered that if the strength of all the body\u2019s muscles was gathered in one place, it would enable even an ordinary adult\u2019s strike to attain the horrifying force of several metric-tons.Theoretically, that was the limit.But the human skeletal system simply does not allow one to employ force of such magnitude.So, it was just a theory.But even then, Intent-Proficiency probably developed one\u2019s muscles to a level incredibly close to that.Lu Sheng stood in the yard and stepped forward to search the Lin brothers\u2019 pouches and clothes.From their waist pouches, he fished out a stack of silver notes \u2013 each worth a hundred talents. He swiftly stuffed them into his own waist pouch without bothering to count them.Then, he obtained a worn black booklet, made of some unknown leather. The booklet was kept by Lin Shuanghuo close to his body and so was clearly very significant.Lu Sheng left the rest of the mess untouched and rested quietly in the yard as he waited for Lu Manor\u2019s men to arrive.Actually, he too had suffered a few injuries from the battle with the two Strength-Proficiency experts.Lin Shuanghuo and Lin Hongshui were both born with the natural gift of strength. Moreover, the Wind-Rippling Saber Technique increased that advantage of theirs, greatly amplifying the force behind their saber moves.In that last head-on collision, the muscles in Lu Sheng\u2019s right arm had also been concussed. His heels were also suffering from a dull ache \u2013 probably an injury incurred by his high-intensity explosion of power.Not to mention the throbbing pain coming from both his shoulders, caused by his continuous series of outbursts within a short period of time as well as saberplay at full strength. Add to that the final collision\u2014perhaps he had injured his bones as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Kurisu\u201cAh\u2026 my body is still too weak\u2026 just a few months\u2019 cultivation is far from enough.\u201d Now that Lu Sheng stopped moving, his entire body was instantly attacked by pain.Thankfully, Jade Crane Skill continuously circulated inner Qi by spreading out an enormous amount of silk-like threads, akin to weaving a spiderweb, to all sore parts of his body.As the inner Qi continued to grow and nourish his body, faint sense of a numbing itch began to cover the parts that originally hurt.\u2018The effects are indeed shocking. This kind of numbing itch should appear only when a wound is healing and growing new flesh,\u2019 Lu Sheng speculated.Glancing over at the corpses on the floor, he walked through the gap in the wall Lin Shuanghuo had appeared from earlier.On the other side of the gap was a backyard belonging to another family.Upon entering the backyard, Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze swept over the footprints that lay on the ground. Following the footprints, he walked along towards the interior of this other family\u2019s house.As he entered the house, Lu Sheng was struck dumb as he saw the sight before him.What greeted him was the sight of Lu Qinging hanging from the house beams, wearing nothing but a smattering of white-colored inner garments.The lass had fainted. More than half of her inner pants was stripped off, revealing delicate and soft snowy-white buttocks. Her legs were tied apart from the other, causing both her legs to spread out wide in a humiliating posture.If not for a strip of cloth obscuring it, one could almost get a view of the most crucial part.As for her upper body, a large part of it was also exposed. Only a slight piece of cloth covered the center of her chest.From the look of things, if Lu Sheng had arrived any later, Lin Shuanghuo would have certainly finished her off.\u201cThankfully\u2026 thankfully\u2026\u201dLu Sheng hastily approached and removed his outer coat to wrap Lu Qingqing with it before putting her down.No one else could know of this incident. Otherwise, Lu Qingqing\u2019s reputation would go down the drain.Lu Sheng decided to keep the fact that Lu Qingqing was held captive a secret.In this generation, if people got wind of such incident happening to a woman, who would dare say for sure whether or not Lu Qingqing had been taken advantage of?A woman\u2019s purity was of extreme importance in the current times.In some families, women who lost their purity before marriage would even be locked in pig cages and drowned!With Lu Qingqing in his arms, Lu Sheng lightly slapped the girl\u2019s face a few times.If inner Qi could be freely controlled, then perhaps, just like the inner force that he had once heard of, he would be able to send some of it into others\u2019 bodies to help them in healing.It was a pity that his Jade Crane Skill inner force could not be moved outside his body in the slightest.Only after slapping her over and over again did Lu Qingqing gradually and weakly regain some consciousness.Having just awoken, both her eyes were dazed as she stared blankly.Only when she felt chilly all over her body did she suddenly remember that she had been defeated and then tied up by those thugs.Her current, odd situation caused her body to quiver all over. When she had come to, she stared at Lu Sheng, the rims of her eyes fast turning red\u2026Tears welled up in her eyes and threatened to flow out at any moment.\u201cHurry and get dressed! Our family\u2019s men will be here any minute,\u201d Lu Sheng hurried her up. Uncle Zhao and the rest should be able to find their way here very quickly.Actually, only a very short amount of time passed since he entered and then dueled with the Phantom Head brothers. And precisely because of that Lu Qingqing was left with just enough buffer time.Lu Qingqing\u2019s face flickered and seemed to quickly understand something. She was no fool, and understood what her Big Bro was trying to say.Hearing that there was still some hope to redeem the situation, she hurriedly straightened her limp body. She went around all over the house to gather her torn clothes, though she wasn\u2019t able to wear them all as some of them were rather damaged.Some of her intimate parts were revealed as she put on her clothes, though she could not be bothered to care too much about that now.Being sensitive and considerate, Lu Sheng turned around to back-face her.He waited for Lu Qingqing to finish dressing herself before turning around again.Seeing how considerate her Big Bro was, Lu Qingqing heaved a long sigh of relief. While her face was still slightly flushed, it was better than before.\u201cBig Bro, what about those thugs!?\u201d A vengeful look appeared on her face.\u201cI killed them,\u201d Lu Sheng said calmly. \u201cWhat about Little Eight? I didn\u2019t see him.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2026 I didn\u2019t see Little Eight here.\u201dLu Qingqing had just answered, when suddenly, she seemed to collect her wits. In an instant, she was dumbfounded.So many people, so many experts\u2014and yet her Big Bro killed them all by himself?She was rather doubtful.In her impression, the image of Lu Sheng was always the refined, scholarly young master. Although he had started practicing martial arts recently, those men were highly skilled; even her Master might not be able to deal with them on his own\u2026\u2018How could Big Bro have done it by himself\u2026?\u2019\u201cWe\u2019ll look for Little Eight on the way back. You\u2019ve finished packing? Later, we\u2019ll say that both of us worked together to kill those men, got it? You were fighting head to head with their disciples when I arrived,\u201d Lu Sheng was preparing their oral testimony.\u201cMm!\u201dLu Qingqing knew the grave severity of the situation. Without asking further, she nodded her head seriously.But as soon as she thought about how Big Bro must have seen her practically naked body, a strange sense of shame and humiliation rose up in her heart.It felt as if she might as well be naked whenever she stood in front of Big Bro.Thinking of that, her face once again flushed red. She quickly lowered her head to hide it.Lu Sheng once again tried to tidy up the last traces of them in the house and kept the rope that was used to tie her earlier.Halfway through, Uncle Zhao and the rest finally arrived.The sound of hurried footsteps belonging to a group of people rushing into the next-door backyard could be heard.Then, a cry of alarm rang out.\u201cIt\u2019s the Lin brothers, Severed Head Blade and Phantom Head Blade!\u201d A slightly older guard\u2019s voice sounded out loudly. The crowd got into a frenzy before quieting down for a moment.Uncle Zhao\u2019s voice rang out next, \u201cLet\u2019s find Young Master and Second Miss!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re alright!\u201dLu Sheng, with Lu Qingqing in tow, returned to the earlier yard.Uncle Zhao, dressed in black athletic robes and holding a twin-saber in his hand, was standing in the middle of the yard.As for the other guards, they all split up to investigate the corpses and leads at the scene.\u201cBrother Sheng! Good thing you\u2019re alright!\u201d A look of relief appeared in Uncle Zhao\u2019s eyes, and his originally stiff and severe manner immediately relaxed.\u201cThis is not a good place to talk, let\u2019s get back first.\u201dAfter speaking, he looked at Lu Qingqing who was following behind, his eyes seemingly in thought. Although both their disguises could fool most people, it did not fool a seasoned player of the pugilistic world like him.Lu Sheng nodded, knowing that someone from the Manor had already notified the authorities. Both of them led Lu Qingqing and the group of guards out and hailed a horse carriage.The three of them sat in the carriage, while the rest either rode horses or ran back as they sped back the way they came. There were also a few people left in the yard who were responsible for communicating with the authorities from the yamen.The three headed straight back to the Manor.Then, they shut the main doors tightly.Lu Quanan, Second Mother and the rest of the family members were already waiting within the Main Hall.Lu Qingqing was brought there after she changed her clothes.Lu Sheng did not follow along. He relayed the entire incident in detail to Uncle Zhao; only, it was a modified version, in which Lu Qingqing had been embroiled in a fight to the death with the enemy\u2019s disciples when Lu Sheng arrived.Thereafter, using his injuries as an excuse, he returned to rest.The physician from the pharmacy also came by to check his wounds.Torn muscles in many areas, some slight hairline fractures, and even a bit of internal bleeding. Shoulder blades were slightly dislocated, and so on and so forth.Lu Sheng really detested these bothersome checks done by different groups going on and on. A very simple matter took half a day to settle.After washing up, a teary-eyed Little Qiao helped him out of his outer coat and onto the bed to rest.After the physician left, Lu Sheng once again felt that his injuries had recovered by quite a bit since their return. His spirit was full of vigor as blood pulsed through this veins; his body showed no signs of having experienced a great battle.At the peak of Jade Crane Skill, the power to recover from wounds was indeed highly powerful and effective.Lying on his bed, Lu Sheng rubbed his tummy, filled with the bowl of ginseng chicken soup he had drunk earlier. His whole body felt warm and fuzzy; it was extremely comfortable.\u2018This trip has been a false scare. Little did I expect that although Second Sis had gotten herself into trouble, it was not with any demons, devils, ghosts or monsters, but two fugitive murderers from many years back instead.\u2019Initially, he was a bundle of nerves because he had previously run into strange occurrences along that street.Therefore, he\u2019d proceeded with much caution.Little had he known that the source of harm was not the supernatural, but men\u2026He lay on his bed, running through the memories of the day\u2019s duel in detail.\u2018From beginning to end, my strokes could probably have been cleaner and more direct. If I used the numbing effect produced by the sound of the tiger\u2019s roar in Black Tiger Saber more flexibly, then perhaps I could even have avoided that forceful head-on collision with the two of them.\u2019His brow furrowed as he began to reflect.\u2018It\u2019s truly challenging to face a physically stronger opponent. As a saber warrior, strength shouldn\u2019t be my weak spot. Maybe I\u2019ll need to find and train in some external force martial arts techniques to improve my strength.\u2019He had not attempted any of those external force martial arts that trained hard skills yet. How would those skills turn out after being modified by the Modifier?***The Lu Manor Main Hall.Lu Quanan sat in the host\u2019s seat, his face somber as he glared at Lu Qingqing below.Next to him were seated Second Mother, Third Mother, and the rest. The whole family was gathered here to enquire into the details of the matter.Lu Qingqing and Uncle Zhao stood below, a few other guards being present as well.\u201c\u2026the situation roughly happened like that,\u201d Uncle Zhao added some finishing touches to the version provided by Lu Sheng and relayed it for everyone present to hear.\u201cAs for the people from the yamen, I\u2019ve already liaised with them. This case was to the credit of Brother Sheng, no one can snatch that away,\u201d when he said this, Uncle Zhao immediately broke into a light smile. \u201cBrother Sheng likes to train martial arts, but little did I expect that he would actually be able to kill Severed Head Blade and Phantom Head Blade! Clearly, his prowess is extraordinary. He is gifted above others, a late bloomer!\u201d\u201cWith regards to Little Sheng, I\u2019m very satisfied and very reassured.\u201dLu Quanan\u2019s face softened a little. Because of Lu Sheng, this capable son of his, his initial anger had soothed quite a bit.Right now, he looked again at Lu Qingqing.\u201cLittle Qing, you take a look at your Big Brother, and then take a look at yourself. Other than creating trouble for your family and your older brother, can\u2019t you do something useful for the family?\u201d Lu Quanan\u2019s voice was harsh. \u201cI sent you to train martial arts, not to come back and kick up a ruckus!\u201d\u201cDad\u2026 I know my mistake,\u201d Lu Qingqing felt deeply regretful. If not for Big Bro who had arrived in the nick of time, then her whole life might have gone down the drain due to this incident.\u201cYou know your mistake? When have you not said that? And then? It\u2019s always the same thing!\u201d Lu Quanan grew angrier the more he talked.\u201cAfter you\u2019ve recovered from your injuries, I\u2019ll find a family to marry you out and give birth to a son, that\u2019ll finally ground you.\u201d\u201cNO!\u201dOnce Lu Qingqing heard about being married off, she instantly reacted like a cat whose tail was stepped on, almost jumping out of her seat.\u201cI don\u2019t want to marry! No! Dad, I know my mistake now. In the future, I\u2019ll definitely help with the family matters! I won\u2019t cause trouble! You rest assured! Really! This time round it\u2019s for real!\u201dLu Quanan ignored her, instead looking towards the physician who had just entered from the side.\u201cHow are Little Sheng\u2019s injuries?\u201dThis physician was actually a distant relative of the Lu family, except that he was in a different line of work. After the Lu Manor thrived, they were all gathered together.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, just some skin-deep abrasions. He needs to rest for about ten days to half a month and he\u2019ll be fine,\u201d the physician hurriedly replied.\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. I\u2019ll ask him again at that time whether he still wants to head to Mountain Edge City to learn martial arts.\u201dAt that thought, Lu Quanan grew a little apprehensive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So, his body\u2019s rather tough. Family head, you need not worry.\u201dUncle Zhao said with a smile.\u201cAt first, even I hadn\u2019t expected that Brother Sheng would be that powerful. Those two were, after all, both experts whom I had tried but failed to arrest in my younger days. To think that, after all these years, they would fall into Brother Sheng\u2019s hands.\u201dHe had seen their wounds. Both had died under Heart-Shattering Palm.However, he had no idea when Brother Sheng had mastered Heart-Shattering Palm; neither could he tell the extent of the skill behind those palm strikes.After all, the mastery of this skill could not be told just from looking at the surface.\u201cThat\u2019s for the best,\u201d Lu Quanan nodded. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine. Back to normal. Let him get some rest and carry on with the plan to go learn martial arts in Mountain Edge City.\u201d\u201cLooking at Little Sheng\u2019s moves, I\u2019m sure he must be extremely passionate about martial arts. Otherwise, there\u2019s no way that he would become so well-trained. So, I\u2019m certain Little Sheng will be glad to hear that,\u201d Second Mother replied gently.\u201cAlright, alright. This was a false alarm. Everybody, go back to business. Little Qing will go back to reflect on herself. Stop wandering outside during this period. Just stay home!\u201d Lu Quanan gave the confinement order.\u201cOk\u2026\u201d Lu Qingqing too was scared out of her wits this time. Had her big brother come later by a minute, she would have been finished.She needed time to recover emotionally as well.***News of Lu Qingqing\u2019s matter quickly spread throughout the entire Lu Manor like wildfire, spreading even to the other families in Nine Links City.And, so did Lu Sheng\u2019s reputation as a martial arts fanatic.These years, few knew of Phantom Head Blade brothers. Still, everyone learned of how Lu Sheng had arrested a few powerful fugitives with his sister and supposedly killed more than a few men.Once this got out, Lu Sheng turned famous overnight.Everyone in the manor started to look at Lu Sheng differently.He was someone who had taken the lives of powerful fugitives!Each time Lu Sheng was spotted, everyone feared him.After all, which fugitive who managed to resist capture for years didn\u2019t have some tricks up his sleeves?\u201cThat\u2019s very normal,\u201d Lu Qingqing sat in Lu Sheng\u2019s room, swinging both her legs back and forth and chewing on an apple in her hand.Because of how she had nearly lost her modesty previously, she now no longer headed out every day.She got used to hanging out in Lu Sheng\u2019s room instead, attempting to persuade him to investigate the Xu family tragic case with her.\u201cNow in Lu Manor, apart from you, Big Bro, and a few martial arts masters like Uncle Zhao, those among the guards who have seen blood before are pathetically few in number. That\u2019s how the servants used to look at me too,\u201d she seemed to have grown used to it. \u201cSpeaking of which, if master and seniors knew that I had such a powerful big bro like you, I wonder what kind of expression they\u2019d have\u2026 it\u2019s fun even just imagining their faces!\u201dLu Qingqing laughed.Gripping a brush, Lu Sheng was composedly practicing calligraphy.\u201cBrother Xu\u2019s case should and must be investigated! It\u2019s just not the right time yet,\u201d he said somberly.\u201cBrother Xu\u2026 died such a terrible death!\u201d Lu Qingqing\u2019s eyes began to redden as she thought about that.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. One day I\u2019ll get to the bottom of this,\u201d Lu Sheng put his brush down and looked at the giant word sprawled across the paper: \u201cendure\u201d.The match against two Strength Proficiency experts this time gave him some awareness of where his limits lay.Every single Strength Proficiency expert was someone not to be trifled with, possessing their own exclusive trademark skill. Needless to say, they were much more powerful than the average martial arts trainees.Although he had attained full mastery of both Black Tiger Saber Technique and Heart-Shattering Palm with the help of the Modifier, it wasn\u2019t a simple matter of one plus one equals two for him to face off against two opponents at once.When two Strength Proficiency experts teamed up, their combined might was more than the sum of its parts. One must realize that it took twice as much energy to deal with them as when fighting against one.If there was just one more Strength Proficiency expert who coordinated well with Lin Brothers, then he would have met his end there and then.Lu Sheng pondered that.Although he did win this time, it was a narrow victory. In the end, even his saber had been broken and he had ended up with numerous wounds riddling his body.\u2018I guess I\u2019m still too weak\u2026 In the Xu family tragic case, just the number of Strength Proficiency protectors amounted to four! Add to that the countless housemen and servants\u2026 to slaughter all of them without a sound within the span of a single night\u2026 that kind of power\u2026 just thinking of it gives me the chills.\u2019Once this thought surfaced, Lu Sheng felt that his own preparations were far, far too inadequate.He needed stronger power, stronger martial arts!\u201cBig Bro, what\u2019s on your mind? How about going shopping with me?\u201dLu Qingqing waved her hand in front of Lu Sheng\u2019s face, anticipation shining in her eyes.Ever since she was saved, she had become another person before Lu Sheng. Her temper had mellowed significantly, becoming gentler and more feminine.\u201cQingqing, do you know of inner force?\u201dLu Sheng responded with a question instead of answering her.\u201cInner force\u2026 I\u2019ve heard master mention it,\u201d Lu Qingqing nodded. \u201cInner force experts are different from us outer force practitioners. Their training is gradual and takes a long time. Normally, without three to five years of cultivation, they\u2019re no different from an average person. Why do you ask, Big Bro?\u201d\u201cYour master\u2026 does he know any inner force experts?\u201d Since he was unable to locate Duanmu Wan, Lu Sheng intended to look for a breakthrough through Lu Qingqing.\u201cWell, he does know a few. Master has two good friends\u2014both priests who cultivate life-force Qi skills,\u201d Lu Qingqing replied.\u201cLife-force Qi skills\u2026 are there those inner force experts with legitimate fighting skills?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 I\u2019ve never heard of any.\u201dLu Qingqing\u2019s reply left Lu Sheng disappointed. But it was also to be expected.Even the mysterious Duanmu Wan could produce no more than a few life-force Qi skills. Lu Qingqing\u2019s master was merely an outer force expert with a bit of fame. The odds of him knowing inner force experts were slim.\u201cWhy? Big Bro\u2019s thinking of training inner force? I heard that stuff\u2019s very iffy and time-consuming\u2026 the training process is fraught with risks and it\u2019s not even very powerful. How can it be faster to attain or stronger in battle than outer force training? What\u2019s the point?\u201d Lu Qingqing could not understand.\u201cI have my plans.\u201dLu Sheng began to form calculations in his mind.Mountain Edge City. He did truly intend to go there, but with this matter arising, it really wasn\u2019t a good time for him to leave Nine Links City\u2014especially considering the great distance between the two cities.His family in this present life has been very good to him; his old dad, second mum, Uncle Zhao and the others all treated him very well.He would hate it if something were to happen to them while he was away.Moreover, in this time and age, if something really did happen, where could he hide and find refuge all by himself?Lu Sheng also sensed that his old dad Lu Quanan was dispatching him to Mountain Edge City to draw him away from a certain something.\u201cA storm is coming\u2026\u201d he heaved a long sigh. Looking at his na\u00efve Second Sister Lu Qingqing, his heart suddenly felt heavy.\u2018If I really leave, perhaps I can hide from danger for a moment. But I can\u2019t always be hiding. At the end of the day, I\u2019ve still got to face it. I should quickly grow while the conditions at home are good and there\u2019s no lack of money. Until I have the strength to protect myself\u2014that\u2019s the right path.\u2019Road to Mountain Edge City was really too long. Lu Sheng already had other plans.Inner-plus-outer training\u2014integrating inner force and outer force\u2014that was the best direction towards great power which came to his mind now.Suddenly, he recalled the secret manual that he had burnt a hole in his pocket to obtain\u2014the incomplete Black Fury Skill.\u2018Although it\u2019s incomplete, it\u2019s the only manual I have in my hands right now. To heck with it.\u2019Listening to Lu Qingqing\u2019s incessant chatter beside him about the interesting trivia from her days as her master\u2019s disciple, Lu Sheng began recalling Black Fury Skill\u2019s force movement routes silently.He had previously spent quite a period of time practicing Black Fury Skill and so remembered the Level One Initiation mantra.Seeing that Lu Sheng was distracted, Lu Qingqing left in disappointment after going on for a while.Little Qiao entered after that to bring Lu Sheng a pail of water to wash his face. Then, she served him his medicine.Lu Sheng did not say a word at that time. He kept his focus entirely on Black Fury Skill\u2019s intent routes while performing those tasks.A guess formed in his mind. The reason why it was so difficult to learn Black Fury Skill could have been because, like Jade Crane Skill, there was supposed to have been an initial Qi movement diagram added to it.Jade Crane Skill\u2019s Qi movement diagram was an immortal crane with its wings stretched out, about to fly.Perhaps Black Fury Skill had something like that too, just that it wasn\u2019t in the manual.\u2018That diagram\u2019s like an overview, coordinating the entire body\u2019s inner Qi movement routes.\u2019Too bad he had too few materials on inner force with him and was thus unable to conduct a systematic research and come up with any reasoned theories.His only option was to just remain focused on practicing Black Fury Skill while nursing his wounds.In the blink of an eye, several days had passed again.Yet another strange incident occurred in Nine Links City.Somebody had discovered a child\u2019s graffiti on the perimeter wall of a side yard on the city\u2019s outskirts.The graffiti looked like it was drawn with charcoal. Some people kept watch over the wall to see whose kid was so mischievous.Unexpectedly, within a night, more graffiti was mysteriously added to the perimeter wall, undetected by anyone. However, not a single soul had been spotted.The Xu family massacre, the Wang Villa well incident, the missing hunters\u2026 and now this mysterious graffiti on the wall.This series of incidents had everyone in Nine Links City like cats on hot bricks.Someone even reported that he heard a blood-curdling scream from outside the city. He mustered up his courage and ventured out to take a look, only to see signs of a fight between ferocious beasts and traces of blood left on the ground.However, the prefectural yamen announced the order to cancel the request for assistance.One morning, Lu Quanan had been summoned to the prefectural yamen with the same three family heads as usual.When he came back, his face looked foul.Lu Sheng inquired about it but he kept silent, remarking only that there was a conflict with the Prefect which made everyone unhappy.Thereafter, Lu Quanan made contact with Lu Sheng\u2019s uncle, Lu Anping\u2014the deputy commander of the garrison.In all these years, the reason why the Lu family had been able to hold their own was not only thanks to Lu Quanan alone. Eldest Uncle Lu Anping was also a strong pillar that held up the family.Both of them conversed in the study behind closed doors for a long time before finally emerging from inside.Then, someone spotted the eldest uncle leaving Lu Manor hurriedly.Although he resting and cultivating in his own room, Lu Sheng was continuously observing the situation in the prefectural yamen through Lu Qingqing and Little Qiao. Not to mention, second mother, fifth mother, Lu Yingying, Uncle Zhao\u2026 and all others would visit him very now and then.At this moment, all of Nine Links City apart from the Lu Manor gave Lu Sheng a sense of living with a sword of Damocles hanging over his head.Just then, Uncle Zhao sent someone over, saying that Little Eight\u2019s whereabouts had been discovered. He had fainted in one of the houses along that street. By the time he was found, he had been starved to a bag of skin and bones.\u201cLittle Eight? Did he say what happened to him? Why was he left alone in that house?\u201d Lu Sheng asked.The one who came to pass on the message was a guard under Uncle Zhao\u2019s command; he shook his head.\u201cHe didn\u2019t say much. He just kept repeating that he rushed over that day as fast as he could. But not long after entering that street, he suddenly fainted. When he came to, he saw us.\u201dLu Sheng frowned. \u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cTrue. Uncle Zhao has already confirmed that other sources corroborated with his testimony. It was indeed as Little Eight said.\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s strange\u2026\u201dLu Sheng shook his head.\u201cYou may leave first.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The guard left swiftly.In the courtyard in front of his room, Lu Sheng paced around.His wounds had long since more or less recovered. Now, he was just practicing Black Fury Skill, awaiting the moment he would be able to sense Qi.As long as a thread of Qi was sensed by him, he would rapidly upgrade the inner force skill. He was bent on truly making Black Fury Skill a part of his strength.Just then, Lu Quanan hurriedly entered the yard with two housemen trailing after him.\u201cSheng\u2019er, you\u2019ve rested quite a while. How about setting off today?\u201dLu Quanan\u2019s face was calm and serene. In his hand was a black silk bundle, which was the money for the journey that he had prepared for Lu Sheng.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In a while, things may get a little messy in the city\u2026 but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got everything arranged,\u201d Lu Quanan flashed a reassuring smile at Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng nodded and said nothing more. Taking Little Qiao along with him, he packed some clothes and then left silently on a horse carriage via the side gate.Sitting in the carriage, Lu Sheng gazed at the Lu Manor shrinking in the distance. For some reason, his heart felt heavy.\u201cYoung Master, are we really going to Mountain Edge City? It\u2019s so far. When will we get to come back?\u201d Little Qiao worried.Lu Sheng smiled but did not reply.The black carriage looked a little worn and was about the same as others on the streets. There were no Lu Manor markings or signs on its body either.As it left the city center and headed towards the main city gate, the carriage was even intercepted and questioned several times by the patrolling guards.Lu Sheng parted the curtain slightly and saw that squads of city guards were leading many last-minute farmer conscripts to patrol the streets.His gaze swept past a pointy building which the carriage passed.\u201cPAH!\u201dSuddenly, Lu Sheng slapped his palm.The horse carriage immediately turned left and entered a relatively narrow alley. Consequently, the carriage slowed down considerably and quickly came to a stop.Lu Sheng took Little Qiao by the hand, lifted the carriage curtains and alighted.\u201cBrother Sheng, I\u2019ve been waiting for you for a long time now.\u201dZheng Xiangui\u2019s chubby face appeared in sight before the two of them.\u201cAi!?\u201dLittle Qiao was instantly surprised.\u201cLet\u2019s go. Here\u2019s not the place to talk. I\u2019ve already prepared the location that you need,\u201d Zheng Xiangui whispered.The carriage again slowly moved out of the alley.However, it was empty this time. Lu Sheng and Little Qiao boarded another carriage in the alley and slowly headed out of the city.Once they were out of the city, they neared a messy rocky mountain a few miles\u2019 distance away from Black Winds Ridge.There was a small patch of green forest there, the sound of a brook coming from within.The carriage paused in front of the forest.Zheng Xiangui alighted from the carriage first and surveyed the surroundings.\u201cThis is the place\u2014a secret hideout I established using some money in the past. It\u2019s yours to use for the time being.\u201dLu Sheng led Little Qiao off the carriage. \u201cThanks, Fatso.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re brothers, why mention it?\u201d Zheng Xiangui replied earnestly. \u201cThe surroundings here aren\u2019t populated. The nearest inhabited place from here is one of my Zheng Family\u2019s villas. I\u2019ve made arrangements for some food to be delivered here into the forest everyday, just outside the hut. You can pick it up yourselves.\u201dLu Sheng nodded.Zheng Xiangui then said, \u201cYou better be careful. This place isn\u2019t far from the Black Winds Ridge. Although the main path is guarded by soldiers and won\u2019t be much of a problem, wild wolves and some stray animals occasionally come by.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Remember to inform me of any news from within the city. You can send them over along with the food,\u201d Lu Sheng reminded.\u201cGot it.\u201dThe three of them entered the forest. Several meters into it, a brook came into their sight, flowing along the wall of the mountain like a silver ribbon. Clear as crystal, it formed a beautiful stream among the bushes and rocks in the forest.The forest teemed with chirping of various species of birds. The trees and grass here were pristine, unmarked by any human activity.Lu Sheng strode across the brook and saw an intricate wooden hut deep within the forest, near the wall of the mountain. It was made of white logs, stacked atop one another like building blocks, forming a minimalistic, white wooden hut. There was even a small garden path on its side.\u201cThis is as far as I\u2019ll see you guys off,\u201d Zheng Xiangui said softly.He had brought two personal bodyguards with him who were trained from their childhood and were absolutely loyal to him. So, he wasn\u2019t concerned with the risk of them revealing any information.\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard this time. Carry on and go back,\u201d Lu Sheng nodded.Zheng Xiangui left swiftly with his company.Lu Sheng then began to instruct Little Qiao to clean up the hut.The hut was stocked with grain and dried meat, as well as some fresh fruits and vegetables, which were clearly just brought over.\u201cYoung Master, don\u2019t tell me we are going to stay here? Aren\u2019t we going to Mountain Edge City anymore?\u201dLittle Qiao remained puzzled.\u201cWe\u2019re still going, but that\u2019s in the future. We\u2019ll stay here for the time being,\u201d Lu Sheng casually replied.The two of them cleaned up the house, which took them until the sky was almost turning dark.Little Qiao lit an oil lamp.In the pitch-black night, the yellow glow of the lamp cast a dim, lonely light on the interior of the hut.Lu Sheng stood in the courtyard, looking up into the skies.The sky was a patch of darkness. Even the moon and the stars had been covered by clouds and not a trace of light could be seen.The oil lamp in the hut emitted a faint yellow glow, casting some light into the courtyard, making it the brightest spot in the entire forest.Lu Sheng stood in the yard and gazed outwards through the fence.The forest was a patch of pitch-black darkness. Every now and then, some unknown sound would arise, and something would move past in a flash.Lu Sheng held onto the saber hanging on his waist with a backhand grip.Zheng Xiangui wanted to arrange some guards for him, but he turned him down. The less people knew that he was staying here, the better.Looking at the trees shrouded in pitch darkness outside the courtyard, Lu Sheng closed the wooden yard gate and turned to do the same for the hut\u2019s windows.The windows were dual-layered. The inner layer was a sheet of paper, while the outer was a layer of solid, hard wood that blocked things from passing through.Lu Sheng shut the outer wooden layer, making the light from within the hut visible only through tiny gaps in the windows.He pushed the door open and entered the hut.Little Qiao was laying the bed.There was only one bed in the hut, laden with wooden planks and dried leaves, then a straw mat and finally a cotton mattress atop it.\u201cYoung Master\u2026\u201dLittle Qiao\u2019s eyes were watery and her cheeks blushed.\u201cIf you would like to rest now, let Little Qiao warm your bed for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng was speechless for a moment. \u201cThere\u2019s still a small bed in the back. Just go sleep on your own.\u201dLittle Qiao looked no different from a young girl twelve or thirteen years-old, which made him feel sinful.\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Little Qiao\u2019s face immediately burned with shame.Out in the wild, with no one else but the Young Master and herself cramped into such a small hut, there was no avoiding each other when it came to changing clothes, bathing and so on. If something did happen, it would be very normal.A pity that Young Master didn\u2019t harbor such thoughts yet.After each of them washed separately, Little Qiao went to bed first under Lu Sheng\u2019s urging.The so-called small bed was basically a bed within the same wooden hut, separated by just a layer of wooden planks. Only a wooden wall the width of a palm separated the big and small beds, in the middle of which was a small door covered with curtains that separated them.It only took a single thought for anything to happen.But Lu Sheng\u2019s thoughts were not there.He slept early after gathering his focus to practice Black Fury Skill for a while.Early in the morning on the second day, Little Qiao went out to pick up the meal box delivered to the gate of the courtyard.After breakfast, Lu Sheng practiced a set of Heart-Shattering Palm moves, then carried on to practice Black Fury Skill.Apart from Little Qiao strolling around in the yard occasionally, the entire morning was a picture of serenity. Lu Sheng spent it completely focused on practicing Black Fury Skill.After lunch, it was Black Tiger Saber.Before dusk, Lu Sheng read the note stuffed into the meal box, finding out that there was no special news. Then, he went to bed early, not forgetting to practice Black Fury Skill for over four more hours before sleeping.The cycle repeated itself.Just like that, Lu Sheng and Little Qiao dwelled in the forest for half a month.But, there was no hint or trace of Lu Sheng progressing in Black Fury Skill.According to the records in the manual and practical martial arts knowledge, a normal person would have given up after half a month without sensing the skill\u2019s Qi, or Qi sense for short.After all, when an inner force skill was suitable for one to cultivate, it only took several days to generate Qi sense.But Lu Sheng understood that Black Fury Skill was a lost inner force skill whose overview diagram was missing. Duanmu Wan had mentioned that initially as well.That\u2019s why he persisted for such a long time. But, he didn\u2019t expect that there would still be no progress till now.Then, just when Lu Sheng was about to give up, a trace of unusual Qi sense finally emerged during the time when he was practicing Black Fury Skill.***The sky was dark and heavy.Even at noon, a trace of cold permeated the air.The forest was enshrouded in shadow, and even birds seemed to have lost their strength, with only one, two chirps resounding every once in a while.Wielding a long saber, Lu Sheng slowly rehearsed Eighty-Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade in the courtyard.His speed was not fast as he was merely training the precision of his strikes.On the surface, it seemed like he was practicing the saber. However, the truth was that Lu Sheng attention remained mostly on Black Fury Skill.\u201cSlash, slash, slash!\u201dAfter slashing sideways with the saber thrice, Lu Sheng sheathed the saber and was about to enter the hut for lunch as per usual.Unexpectedly, however, as the final slash ran its course, a trickle of scorching Qi flow flashed across his lower back between his kidneys before vanishing.Lu Sheng froze in his tracks, carefully savoring the sensation.Slowly, he activated Black Fury Skill, tracking its movement in his body.Immediately, the scorching sensation flashed past, again at the spot between his kidneys.\u201cThis is\u2026 Qi sense!\u201dLu Sheng was overwhelmed with joy.After so many days of hard work, he was beginning to suspect whether Black Fury Skill in his hands was really an authentic inner force skill.Thankfully, his hard work paid off. The inner Qi generated inside his body finally put to rest the heavy burden on his heart.\u2018I\u2019ve got to level it up quickly while the Qi sense remains!\u2019Without a further word, Lu Sheng struck while the iron was hot.\u2018Deep Blue,\u2019 Lu Sheng called out in his mind, and the blue frame of the Modifier rapidly floated before his eyes.He clicked on the Modification button and the square frame flashed once quickly.This time, the contents in the frame were indeed different than previously; \u201cBlack Fury Skill\u201d was now added to the bottom of his list of martial arts.\u201cBlack Fury Skill: Uninitiated.\u201dDespite their simplicity, these few words gave birth to irrepressible joy in Lu Sheng\u2019s heart.Since he was presently unable to find a better method of leveling himself up, Black Fury Skill almost became the last glimmer of hope that he clung onto.Otherwise, he really was at a loss as to how he could deal with the unknown mysteries and strange threats of the outside world.\u2018Modify Black Fury Skill, upgrade one level!\u2019Lu Sheng had just expressed his intention when the \u201cUninitiated\u201d status of the Black Fury Skill jumped to \u201cInitiated\u201d without warning.\u201cBOOM!!!\u201dAt almost the same time as Lu Sheng saw the change in status, his five viscera and six bowels boiled without warning!An immense heat wave emerged within his body out of thin air, gushing tyrannically along more than ten of his meridians.The heat wave scorched and boiled, like a stream of flame flowing within Lu Sheng\u2019s body!He stood rooted to the ground, his face reddening and swelling rapidly. Even the skin all over his body began turning as red as cooked prawn shells.Massive volumes of sweat poured out from his pores, evaporating into white steam and rising into the air.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

All the bones and muscles in his body felt as if they were pierced with needles.This was a completely different story than when he practiced Jade Crane Skill. Presently, he felt like he had just been smashed all over his body by a giant hammer.\u2018Good thing Jade Crane Skill has stored up quite a big amount of inner Qi in my body during this period\u2026 just what I need to recover.\u2019Feeling Jade Crane Skill at work within his body, automatically healing his organs, he heaved a sigh of relief.\u2018Never did I expect that just the Initiation level of Black Fury Skill would have such tyrannical effects. When I reach higher levels later on, that force\u2026 how strong would it be?\u2019He shuddered at the imagination.\u201cLittle Qiao!\u201d He shouted.\u201cComing, Young Master!\u201dLittle Qiao hurriedly ran over from the back, water dripping from her hands. It looked like she was in the middle of washing something.\u201cBring me some medicinal tea.\u201dLu Sheng instructed. He was now in pain all over and his body felt extremely heaty, making him parched with thirst. [1]Little Qiao quickly served the already concocted medicinal tea. In it were many Yin-nourishing herbs, such as Jadeite Dendrobium, Southern Barbaric Turtle Shell, Winter Gardenia Jasmine, Yin-Winter and other expensive herbs unique to this world.Gulping down a cup of medicinal tea in one mouthful, Lu Sheng immediately felt a cooling sensation slide down his throat into his stomach and then radiate across all areas of his body from his stomach.The cooling sensation relieved him of the heatiness in his body.Lu Sheng continued to gulp down the entire pitcher\u2019s worth of tea. [2]Only after he had chewed and swallowed all the herbs together with the tea did he breathe comfortably, though he felt like having even more.He lay down to rest on the bed for several hours before the sky turned dark.Finally, the pain all over Lu Sheng\u2019s body was gradually relieved.Seeing that there was nothing out of the ordinary with Lu Sheng, Little Qiao assumed that he simply felt thirsty, and did not pay extra attention. Picking up the pitcher, she went out to carry on washing clothes by the brook.Having rested for a while, Lu Sheng went out into the courtyard again with his saber in the evening, intending to test out the might of Black Fury Skill.The reaction induced by Black Fury Skill far surpassed that of Jade Crane Skill. This especially piqued his curiosity. How powerful exactly was this inner force skill?His heart itching, Lu Sheng rose from bed to practice as soon as the pain abated.In the dimly lit forest.Lu Sheng carried his saber and walked out of the courtyard. He went far away from the hut, finding a deserted clearing.Then, he began attempting to activate Black Fury Skill\u2019s inner Qi.Black Fury Skill\u2019s inner Qi circulation was from both kidneys to his abdomen, as if forming a belt around his waist. It was very strange.At Initiation level, the inner Qi was already chopstick-thick.Lu Sheng controlled it with his mind. Indeed, in contrast with Jade Crane Skill, Lu Sheng could command and control it at his fingertips.He tried drawing a strand of inner Qi from his abdomen upwards. Rapidly, it flowed to his right shoulder, right arm, right palm and then finally the long saber.At the precise moment when the strand of inner Qi flowed into the saber blade, Lu Sheng heard the faint sizzling of something burning.With his arms boiling hot, an irrepressible frenzy gushed forth in his heart as he swung his arms forward without warning.\u201cCHI!\u201dThe long saber suddenly slashed outwards, landing a blow on a tree trunk before Lu Sheng.\u201cSWISH, SWOOSH!!\u201dThe huge tree, thick enough for a man to hug, trembled violently. Massive amounts of leaves fell like rain. The saber in Lu Sheng\u2019s hands was now deeply etched into the trunk. At the same time, a faintly perceptible blackness was spreading from the wound on the trunk.\u2018It\u2019s slightly black?\u2019Lu Sheng pulled out the saber forcibly, frowning as he touched the black area.\u2018Looks as if it\u2019s been burnt by fire\u2026 is it high temperature? Or some other effect?\u2019He thought for a while. Then, surveying his surroundings, he swiftly dashed out, reaching for a bush and grabbing at something in it.\u201cCHI~~~~\u201dA multi-colored wild chicken was in his hand, caught by its neck. It had hidden in the bush, thinking that Lu Sheng could not see it. But, in the end, it was caught all the same.\u2018Let\u2019s give it a try\u2026 Let\u2019s see if it\u2019s really as I\u2019m thinking it is.\u2019Lu Sheng carefully walked back to the trunk, then scraped some powder off the edges of the wound with his finger.The light black powder was collected in his palm. Then, he meticulously shoved it down the wild chicken\u2019s throat.After it had consumed the powder, Lu Sheng waited for a moment as he observed the wild chicken calling out madly, looking as if it was in malaise.He again scraped some more powder and made the chicken eat it.This time, the wild chicken was able to make only a few steps once Lu Sheng released it, collapsing onto the ground.Lu Sheng walked over and touched it. The wild chicken\u2019s body was boiling hot. It was still alive but devoid of any strength in its body, as if it were having a high fever.\u2018As I thought! It\u2019s poison! And, it should be a fire-based poison.\u2019In his mind, Lu Sheng tentatively confirmed the Black Fury Skill\u2019s properties.He took out the manual, which he carried everywhere with him, and looked carefully over the details recorded within.\u201d \u2026Black Fury Skill, vicious and scorching. Extremely fiery and poisonous. Without an opposing inner Qi to counteract and neutralize it, the victim will die after three days.\u201dRegarding the might of Black Fury Skill, there was only such a simple one-liner recorded.But, it was already sufficient for Lu Sheng to discern what Black Fury Skill was all about.Indeed, it was poison that he now wielded!\u2018Amazing,\u2019 Lu Sheng exclaimed in his mind.This Black Fury Skill was truly a different kind altogether from life-force skills like Jade Crane Skill. It was an inner force skill specially designed for killing and combat!The gap between their might was a wide chasm indeed!Lu Sheng examined Black Fury Skill\u2019s inner Qi within his body using his senses.The stroke earlier had consumed a small portion of his inner Qi. He compared it with the total amount left.\u2018At the level of Initiation, I should be able to hold it for ten strokes or so. Any more than that and I\u2019ll run out of inner Qi. Black Fury Skill\u2019s inner Qi seems to also possess the effect of increasing my explosive strength. It\u2019s really too useful!\u2019Having found out its effects, Lu Sheng turned back. This was only its power at the Initiation level. If he waited till it was upgraded to the higher levels, who knew how powerful it would get?He was really anticipating it.Back in the hut\u2019s courtyard, he ran into two Zheng family guards who came to deliver their meal.Seeing Lu Sheng, both of them hurried over to greet him.\u201cYoung Master Sheng, there\u2019s been some happenings lately. It\u2019s all in the meal box. Please take a look at the news when you see fit.\u201dBoth of them delivered polite pleasantries and then quickly left the forest.Lu Sheng took over the meal box at the entrance of the courtyard. Without further ado, he opened the box. As expected, a letter sealed with wax was placed in it.Entering the courtyard, he handed over the meal box to Little Qiao, tore open the envelope and retrieved the note within.\u2018Brother Sheng, the Xu family tragic case from previously in the city has now been cracked.It was cracked by an expert hired by the yamen. He arrested a large gang of people in the city without mercy, beheading more than ten of them this afternoon at the entrance of the grocery market.\u2019Zheng Xiangui\u2019s opening line caused Lu Sheng to be in a daze.He read on.It turned out that the series of incidents during this period had made everyone like cats on hot bricks, even leading to a riot a few days ago. As a result, many residents and peasants who lived in the city were escaping towards Zi Hua City. The authorities even had to retain some of them by force.Thereafter, in order appease public morale, the yamen arrested a few dozen men in one go and declared them the culprits of the previous few cases. Only then did the public calm down slightly.After reading the note, the corners of Lu Sheng\u2019s mouth turned upward in a cold smile.\u2018Looks like the yamen can\u2019t take it anymore. Culprits? If the culprits were so easy to arrest, they wouldn\u2019t have to wait until now.I bet they\u2019re just finding people any way they like to make up the numbers.\u2019Fortunately, the note mentioned that nothing was going amiss at Lu Manor; everything went on as usual.Lu Chenxin and other young masters who were supposed to be playing continued to play as usual, seemingly unaffected in the slightest.Business for the brothels and entertainment places in the city boomed recently, too. Clearly, it was because people needed an outlet for the immense stress and fear they were under.Lu Sheng inhaled deeply.\u2018These methods can indeed stabilize the situation, but only temporarily. It\u2019s at best a stopgap measure. The case hasn\u2019t really been cracked, and if a similar case crops up again\u2026\u2019He kept the note and collected his thoughts.Facing the power of these supernatural elements, the present Lu Manor of Nine Links City was just as powerless as normal commoners.If those things really happened to them, it would be a foregone conclusion.Therefore, his sole objective now was to upgrade himself as much as he could to make himself stronger.Only then could he have the strength to protect himself when facing off against the supernatural in the future!He did not know how strong he had to be in order to deal with that stuff. Hence, he could only exhaust all means within his reach to maximize his power.After receiving the letter, Lu Sheng began consuming copious amounts of expensive nourishing herbs which they had brought out.Each day after his three meals, he would let Little Qiao boil thick medicinal soup.Under the nourishment of such strong medicinal effects, the aftereffects of upgrading Black Fury Skill into the Initiated level vanished in a mere three days.Four days later\u2026\u2018Second upgrade!\u2019Lu Sheng was standing before the tree trunk from that day.The depth of the blade wound from that day was about a fifth of the trunk\u2019s width. Now, it remained on the trunk, its edges already withered and dead.This was one of the thickest trees in the entire forest. Yet right now, even it appeared sickly and lifeless.Lu Sheng decided he might as well pick this spot as the site of his second breakthrough.Sitting against the tree, he laid out the medicinal soups from the meal box one by one and then sat cross-legged.Black Fury Skill\u2019s inner Qi was circulating unbroken along the route between his abdomen and kidneys.\u2018Deep Blue,\u2019 Lu Sheng called out in his mind.The blue Modifier floated into sight before him. Lu Sheng looked at the Black Fury Skill column.With his mind, he pressed the Modify button.The square frame flashed once.Lu Sheng\u2019s face immediately turned solemn.\u2018Upgrade Black Fury Skill by one level!\u2019 He thought.\u201cSWOOSH!\u201dOriginally, the status of Black Fury Skill was \u201cInitiated\u201d. Presently, at Lu Sheng\u2019s will, the word \u201cInitiated\u201d flashed rapidly and turned into the words \u201cLevel One\u201d.Before Lu Sheng could delight in it, he felt a heat wave slightly weaker than the one before flow throughout his body in an instant.Both in and out of his body, he felt like he was being baked in a furnace. Point-blank.In the span of just a few short breaths, sweat was pouring down all over Lu Sheng\u2019s body like rain. His skin was once again dyed red.Fortunately, his body was somewhat used to it this time round and thus it wasn\u2019t the same tough going as the first time.In just a few tea cups\u2019 worth of time (that is slightly over ten minutes), Lu Sheng slowly recovered his breath.Although every single spot on his body was covered in pain, several new meridians were burst open by Black Fury Skill\u2019s inner Qi, adding to the network of circulation. Naturally, these newly opened meridians needed repairing too, which also took time.But right now, he felt as if he was filled with Qi from head to toe, to the point of exploding.\u2018Let\u2019s try again!\u2019Lu Sheng stood up and drew the long saber behind his waist.[1] ED/N: \u201cHeaty\u201d refers to a TCM concept where there\u2019s too much Yang Qi within one\u2019s body and not enough Yin Qi.[2] TL/N: A pitcher can hold five servings [of tea].Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As he activated the inner Qi and it traveled across his muscles, skin and bone marrow, Lu Sheng felt as if they were on fire.Black Fury Qi emitted from both his shoulders, travelling along the back of his waist and flowing into his right arm before fusing into his right palm and pouring through the long saber.\u201cCHI!!\u201dThe saber blade slashed into the air, making a sound like the shredding of paper, then hacked violently into the tree trunk before him.The stroke struck deeply into the tree, cutting through half of the trunk before it got stuck and stopped.\u2018Great!\u2019Lu Sheng\u2019s heart leapt for joy.He knew that he had once again made a vast improvement.His body wracked in pain, Lu Sheng dragged himself back into the wooden hut to rest.In the subsequent days, he did absolutely nothing. Other than exercising his body for a little bit, he spent most of his time sleeping and resting.At the very most, he would circulate Jade Crane Skill at a faster rate. Jade Crane Skill could help strengthen and heal his body much faster.He needed to make adequate preparations to break into the subsequent two levels.After all, there were three levels that he could cultivate in the Black Fury Skill Manual!***At the Lu Manor in Nine Links City.Sister Yu held a basket in her hands, within which were a few hard-boiled eggs, some yellow-bean cakes, and two pieces of wind-dried smoked meat.She made her way out of the Lu Manor through a side door, called out to the door guards, and walked out along a little alley\u2014all these with great familiarity, like a walk in the park.Near the mouth of the alley, a few kids with ponytails ran around kickin up a ruckus, hoping to snatch a stick of candied hawthorn fruit from the hands of the kid in the lead.Seeing this, Sister Yu sighed. She thought of how Little Eight was just as adorable when he was younger, always running about in front of her, badgering her for a stick of the candied hawthorn fruit.She was only eighteen years old and still young at that time. Each day, she would go to work at the Lu Manor. Occasionally, she would receive some tips that she did not pass to her parents, which counted as some spare change for her to spend.She would then use this money to buy some snacks for Little Eight\u2014he was only about a few years old at that time.But now\u2026Thinking about how Little Eight seemed to have lost his mind nowadays, Sister Yu felt extremely miserable in her heart.She continued along the main street in front of the Manor entrance and returned to her usual manner, ending her walk down memory lane. She decided to visit each and every stall to buy some knick-knacks for the children at home.Today was a rare day off when she had to return home to rest. She intended to select nice little surprises for her husband and children.\u201cChild, my child!\u201dSuddenly, she saw a woman with disheveled appearance. She was sitting dazedly at the corner of the wall, murmuring to herself in a low voice.Somehow, she felt that the woman seemed rather familiar, as if she had seen her somewhere before, though she couldn\u2019t quite put her finger on it.She took a few glances, feeling pity for the woman.She then retrieved a cake from her basket and placed it before the woman.\u201cPlease eat. This world\u2026 hai,\u201d she sighed.She straightened herself and turned to continue her search for what she needed.\u201cPA.\u201dIn the blink of a moment, she felt an icy cold, wet and slippery hand grabbing tightly onto her own right hand.\u201cHave you seen my child!\u201dThe voice said.Sister Yu\u2019s heart lurched and she turned around. It was the woman who had been sitting on the floor.She glared fixedly at Sister Yu with a pair of bloodshot eyes, with such intensity that her eyes were seemingly about to pop out of their sockets.\u201cWhat are you doing? Let go!\u201dSister Yu was frightened as she hurriedly shook herself away with all her might, then retreated two steps back.\u201cAre you mad!?\u201dHowever, that woman seemed not to hear a word as she continued to glare unflinchingly at her.Inwardly, Sister Yu cursed her bad luck. Turning around, she hurried off with her head low, not intending to do any more shopping. She felt a faint, tingling pain appear in the place where her hand had been grabbed.Passing through this street, she took a turn into a small alley as she went on her way home.Although it was quiet and isolated, it helped her save quite a bit of time as she did not need to make detours.The alley was quite long, with a number of twists and turns along the way. Both sides of the alley were flanked by ordinary single-story houses, their roofs at the level slightly above the height of an average man. In the alley, there were many puddles of dirty water and litter strewn all over the place.Sister Yu looked at her wrist. The place where she had been grabbed earlier had begun to turn red.\u201cWhat bad luck! Ai\u2026 I\u2019ll need to apply some ointment when I get back.\u201dShe jumped across a dirty puddle, but the pink embroidered flowers on her fabric shoes were nonetheless stained by some of the sewage. Her mood instantly soured even further.She stomped her feet violently on the ground and proceeded onwards a few steps.\u201cBam.\u201dShe suddenly knocked into someone.She raised her head.\u201cHave you seen my child?\u201dIt was actually the woman from before!Sister Yu\u2019s heart thumped loudly, as if about to burst forth from her chest.She stumbled many steps backwards, without even noticing that she had directly landed onto the dirty puddle.\u201cYou, you, you!!!\u201dThis woman\u2019s bloodshot eyes were locked onto Sister Yu.\u201cChild, my child!\u201dSister Yu turned around, intending to flee.\u201cPA.\u201dAn emaciated hand caught her arm with powerful strength.\u201cHave you seen my child?\u201dThe woman maintained the same wooden, expressionless face as she repeated that same line.\u201cHELP\u2026!\u201dThe sound barely echoed down the alley before it came to a premature end, and deathly silence replaced it\u2026***Three days later, the Lu Manor.Second Mother Liu Cuiyu\u2019s brows furrowed as she sat on the wooden bench, looking onto the relative of Sister Yu who came to relay some news.\u201cSister Yu is not back? She applied for leave and left to return home to her family three days ago.\u201dThis burly male relative had the unique stench of mud about him, something characteristic of farmers. With him standing there in the side hall, the space felt somewhat cramped.\u201cUsually, Big Sis would get back way ahead of time, but this time round, the people at home were all waiting and waiting, yet saw no sign of her. So, we got worried\u2026 plus, with the many incidents that have happened within the city\u2026 anyway, they got me to come here to ask\u2026\u201dLiu Cuiyu shook her head.\u201cShe indeed left a long time ago. She even took a few pieces of dried meat and biscuits from the kitchen\u2026 After so many days, if she hadn\u2019t gone back, where could she have gone to?\u201dShe began to grow a bit worried.\u201cBad news! Bad news!\u201dSuddenly, urgent cries of alarm were heard from outside the house.A lass, pale and flustered from fright, came running in.\u201cSecond Mistress! Bad news! Something has happened to Sister Yu!\u201d\u201cWhat happened?!\u201d Second Mother Liu Cuiyu stood up in an instant, the expression on her face changing.The burly man also turned as white as a sheet of paper as he looked at the lass running in.\u201cSister Yu\u2019s body has been found by someone in an alley outside the city. It\u2019s been lifeless for a couple of days!\u201dThe lass\u2019 words immediately caused Second Mother and the burly man to be stunned.\u201cLifeless\u2026?\u201dReeling from the shock, Liu Cuiyu once again sat down.***Several days later\u2026Lu Sheng savored the feeling of the blade he held in his hands in detail.Black Fury Qi flowed from within his body into the saber\u2019s blade, akin to a wafting hot air that slowly drifted from within him to swiftly dilute into the saber before spreading out to evenly cover the entire blade.His injuries had recovered a great deal.He decided that, on this day, he would once again upgrade the level of Black Fury Skill to reach the second stratum.Now, his body was more and more accustomed to the agitation caused by Black Fury Qi. The injuries resulting from upgrading a level should likely be lower than the previous time.\u201cSWOOSH!\u201dHe began to practice Black Tiger Saber Technique.Black Tiger Saber Technique had a total of three moves, but in actuality, it could be further divided into more than ten over variations of moves.Through combining a few of the variations that he had gained enlightenment of with the variations Uncle Zhao had imparted to him, he produced a set of complicated and varied saber strokes.In the open clearing in front of the wooden hut, Lu Sheng clutched the long saber in hand. His whole body flashed as light reflected off the saber in rapid succession and swooshing sounds of the surrounding air being cut rang out.The silver beams of saber light danced around him in a sphere, making it seem like his entire person was cocooned within.Black Tiger Saber Technique was extremely imposing, with multiple hacking and chopping moves that lent a terribly fierce air to it when he trained.Lu Sheng practiced the three saber moves repeatedly over ten times, causing his blood and Qi to boil. From time to time, Black Fury Qi would fuse into the long saber and add tremendous power to his moves.Taking advantage of the blood and Qi coursing through his veins, he promptly kept his saber and called out in his mind.\u2018Deep Blue!\u2019The Modifier screen sprang forth.Lu Sheng moved quickly. He pressed the Modify button, then concentrated all his focus onto the Black Fury Skill section.\u2018Upgrade Black Fury Skill by one level!\u2019 He commanded silently.\u201cSwish.\u201dImmediately, the state of Black Fury Skill leapt from Level One to Level Two.Except that this time round, the change happened somewhat slowly, and was not as quick as before.Lu Sheng had just finished modifying when he felt the Black Fury Qi within him increase exponentially. A vast amount of Black Fury Qi seemed to materialize from out of nowhere and grew to two portions roughly the size of one\u2019s fist, circulating at each of his shoulders respectively.\u2018It seems like my body has adapted this time round. Moreover, the Second Level merely increases the overall amount of Black Fury Qi. It should be fine.\u2019Lu Sheng had read from the manual that the Second Level was the safest of the levels, which was why he dared to directly break into it in the middle of saber practice.After breaking through to the Second Level, Lu Sheng felt that the reserves inside his body from before had been thoroughly emptied.This was especially the case for the accumulated Jade Crane Skill\u2019s Qi.This was a Qi skill that nourished the body. Ordinarily, his diligent training should have resulted in overflowing Qi that would have gathered and congealed into a ball of Qi at his chest.After the thickness of the inner Qi had reached its limit, that ball of Qi would indicate that it would begin to increase naturally.But just this one breakthrough of Black Fury Skill depleted the ball of Jade Crane Skill Qi, turning it into nothingness in the blink of an eye.Additionally, the originally thick and sturdy Jade Crane Skill\u2019s inner Qi was immediately reduced to the thickness of an embroidery needle.Lu Sheng grew in his resolve after his breakthrough into the Second Level. It was now about time for lunch.\u201cYoung Master, a new letter has arrived!\u201dLittle Qiao carried the meal box as she walked in from the door of the yard, waving a yellow envelope with a red seal in her other hand.\u201cLet me see it.\u201dLu Sheng kept the saber back into its sheath, hanging on his side, then received the letter Little Qiao brought.Retrieving the letter and opening it, he read through it once quickly and his face quickly darkened. Then, he kept the letter.\u201cLittle Qiao, it\u2019s time for us to head back,\u201d he said calmly.\u201cBack to Lu Manor?\u201dLittle Qiao was thrown off guard, but elated.\u201cThat\u2019s right, let\u2019s go home,\u201d Lu Sheng nodded.Both of them packed their bags in a jiffy, finished their lunch and left a note at the entrance to the yard. Then, they headed for Nine Links City in a hurry.From the wooden hut in the little forest to Nine Links City was a journey of roughly eight or nine miles.A long saber hung across Lu Sheng\u2019s back. It was an ordinary saber made of fine iron rather than some famous weapon. However, its strength was in its sturdiness and weightiness, which ensured that it wouldn\u2019t get damaged easily.Both of them sped unrelentingly towards Nine Links City. Little Qiao was dead beat; halfway through the journey, she even needed Lu Sheng to carry her for a stretch of distance. That\u2019s how she was able to prop herself up to the end.Lu Sheng was currently practicing Black Fury Skill, on top of which he also diligently practiced saber techniques each day. Thus, his body had grown much tougher than before.This was especially due to Black Fury Skill that spurred on his growth.Each time it completed a revolution within his body, it felt like a ball of piping hot Qi flowed around his body, nourishing his muscles and bone marrow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0KurisuPractically each morning after he woke up, Lu Sheng felt his muscles grow sturdier and stronger, and his body increasingly mightier.But the price he had to pay for this was an increased appetite, which had grown to at least twice of what it had been, the effects felt during each meal. Moreover, his meals all consisted of lavish portions of fish and meat as well as expensive medicinal tea each day.Just the expenditure on his meals alone would be enough to bankrupt an average family.Lu Sheng did not dilly-dally along the way. Once he entered the city, he traced back the familiar road to the Lu Manor entrance.Seeing him approach, the doorman standing guard at the entrance immediately greeted him in welcome.\u201cYoung Master is back!\u201d\u201cMm,\u201d Lu Sheng gave a cursory reply before striding into the Manor.There was a rather strange atmosphere within the Manor, but when the servants and helpers saw that he had returned, they all scurried around to greet him.\u201cYoung Master is back!\u201d Someone shouted.\u201cYoung Master! Young Master is back!\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s Young Master!\u201dOne of the servant-maids ran over in a hurry. A faint look of surprise mixed with joy could be seen on her face, akin to someone out of her wits who suddenly chanced upon a life-saving antidote.\u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d\u201cThe Family Head asks you to come over now,\u201d another servant-maid ran over and hastily replied.\u201cMm.\u201dLu Sheng lowered his saber and placed it behind his back.He rushed straight towards the inner yard.The inner yard was a picture of quiet, to the extent that the silence was somewhat eerie, even cold.He saw there several servant girls, each one more gloomy than the other. Those near him spoke out in greeting, but those further away didn\u2019t notice him and remained engrossed in their chitchat. Sounds of their conversation drifted from afar along with the wind.\u201cYesterday night, there was the sound of a woman crying in Sister Yu\u2019s room again.\u201d\u201cI heard about that too, it seemed to come from somewhere far away. Some of the guards walked past, but saw no one inside the room, not even a shadow.\u201d\u201cOh please, let\u2019s not talk about it anymore, it\u2019s so scary.\u201d\u201cCould it be a female ghost?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t spout nonsense! Be careful or you\u2019ll get a beating.\u201dWith his saber behind him, Lu Sheng crossed the stone bridge and caught wind of the casual talk between the servant girls.From what these people were saying, Sister Yu\u2019s Lily Flower Room at the back yard had since become the biggest restricted zone within Lu Manor.No one needed any reminders to stay away; none of them dared to go near.His mood fell. Putting the conversations together with the contents of the letter, his mood instantly turned dour.Finally, what he had feared this whole time had happened!This world was already plagued with danger and malice all over. For an ordinary man, there was zero chance of resistance against any such strange occurrences.What he was worried about was that all that befell the Xu Family would one day suddenly strike the Lu Manor as well.When that happened, what could he use to resist it\u2026? What could he use to save himself?What could he use to save his family in this life?\u2018Female ghost? Well, I want to see which female ghost can defend against MY saber!\u2019 A fierce glint shone deep in his eyes, viciousness rising in his heart as he strode towards the Main Hall in the inner yard.Wasn\u2019t all he had accumulated thus far for the sole purpose of countering that which was happening before his eyes?Entering the Main Hall within the inner yard, Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze immediately fell upon the haggard Lu Quanan, who was sitting at the host\u2019s seat. Next to him, Second Mother, Third Mother and the rest hurried over.All his siblings and cousins from both maternal and paternal side were present.Other than during festivals or special occasions, this was the first time all family members had gathered together.All of them turned to see Lu Sheng, burly and strapping as he strode in with saber on his back.A hint of joy appeared on Lu Quanan\u2019s face, but turned into worry in an instant.\u201cLittle Sheng, you\u2026 ai. You shouldn\u2019t have come back.\u201d\u201cDad, just say it. What happened? Sister Yu died?\u201d Lu Sheng wasted no time as he asked straightforwardly.Recently, he had been practicing saber strokes everyday. On top of that, Black Fury Qi constantly flowed through him. All this lent a sliver of fierce, murderous air to him.Seeing this, those present then remembered that Brother Sheng had actually killed two thoroughly fiendish and cruel fugitives. He was a ferocious character who could kill even murderers.At that thought, their originally frightened and anxious hearts were somewhat soothed for the moment.\u201cLet me tell you what happened instead,\u201d Second Mother Liu Cuiyu sighed and said.Lu Sheng found a seat to the right. \u201cPlease go ahead, Second Mother.\u201dLiu Cuiyu pondered for a moment as she organized her thoughts.\u201cThis matter begins with Sister Yu\u2019s sudden death a while back.\u201dShe sighed again.\u201cThat day, someone from Sister Yu\u2019s family came over to ask me if Sister Yu had gone back, to which I replied that she had already left way before he came to inquire.That man then said that her family had waited for a long time to no avail, and thus he came to the Manor to look for her.I also had my suspicions, and was just about to send someone out in search when we received news from the yamen that Sister Yu had died in an alley. It had been a few days, and her corpse was already frigid.Afterwards, I forked out some silver to count towards Sister Yu\u2019s funeral expenses. But only two days after that incident, another person from the Manor went missing as well. I sent some people out to search, they found the corpse in a river beyond the city.\u201dLiu Cuiyu\u2019s face was awash with sorrow as she recounted till here.\u201cFrom that day onwards, one person from the Manor would go missing everyday. We haven\u2019t been able to find out anything! It\u2019s already the fifth day today.And every night, faintly discernible sounds of a woman\u2019s wails would drift out from the Lily Flower Room where Sister Yu used to stay. We went in to investigate, but there was no one inside.There used to be five people who stayed in that room. Now, of the five, three have already gone missing\u2026\u201dHearing that, Lu Sheng\u2019s face was already the picture of gloom.\u201cWhat did the people at the yamen say?\u201d\u201cWhat can they say? They know absolutely zilch! They gave some random excuse to shirk their responsibility and left,\u201d Lu Chenxin couldn\u2019t help but interrupt, his voice laced with fury.\u201cI got your Eldest Uncle to send some men to keep watch during the night, but that wasn\u2019t too helpful either. When there are many people around, that sound doesn\u2019t appear; we can only hear it when there are few people around,\u201d Lu Quanan shook his head and said.\u201cWhere\u2019s Qingqing?\u201d Lu Sheng suddenly realized that Lu Qingqing was actually missing from the crowd.\u201cShe ran off on her own to the Zheng Family. Something has also cropped up there,\u201d Lu Quanan said helplessly.\u201cSomething has also cropped up at the Zheng Family?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s heart constricted.\u201cBut it\u2019s not like our problem, rather, they met with some bandits who attacked their merchant groups on the road. I don\u2019t know where that lass Qingqing managed to find a lead, but she now suspects that the bandits are related to the Xu Family incident. She went out yesterday to investigate and has not been back since,\u201d Second Mother Liu Cuiyu remarked.Lu Sheng gave a cold snort. \u201cThis lass is getting more and more out of hand. On the other hand, for the matter within the Manor, even if it\u2019s not a female ghost, a highly skilled expert in qinggong will also be able to do such a thing! What about Uncle Zhao? What does he think?\u201d [1]\u201cYour Uncle Zhao and a few of the other uncles have all been conscripted to the yamen to support the forces somewhere outside the city. Come to think of it, they still have not returned yet,\u201d Lu Quanan replied.\u201cWhich is to say, that person took advantage of their absence and that\u2019s why he dares to come to the Manor to pretend to be a ghost?\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s first words deemed this matter to be the work of man rather than the work of demons, devils, ghosts or monsters.Regardless of whether this was the work of the supernatural or not, it could only be declared the work of man on the surface!Otherwise, the mighty and illustrious Lu Family might just fall apart.Lu Quanan also immediately understood this principle and nodded in reply.\u201cNow that you say it, it really does seem like the work of man\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s someone crying in Sister Yu\u2019s Lily Flower Room at night, right? I\u2019ll go stay there tonight. Let\u2019s see if anyone else goes missing,\u201d Lu Sheng decided.\u201cBut, Little Sheng\u2026\u201d Lu Quanan wanted to add something else, but Lu Sheng raised his hand to stop him.\u201cDon\u2019t worry Dad, I know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Lu Sheng said calmly.No matter whether the other party was a man or a ghost, since it was afraid of crowds, then there would definitely be a viable solution to this.If this small obstacle before them proved insurmountable, then if they met with a vicious character like the one that suddenly wiped out the whole Xu Family, wouldn\u2019t they be relegated to being helpless lambs facing a butcher?\u201cLittle Sheng\u2026 you must be careful\u2026\u201dLiu Cuiyu was worried.The rest of the people, on the other hand, looked as if a huge burden had been lifted off their shoulders.Since Brother Sheng, who had even killed fugitives before, said that it was the work of man, then it very likely could be true.With Brother Sheng around, surely that thug would very soon be captured.Once the meeting ended, Lu Chenxin, Lu Tianxiang, Lu Yingying and the rest went out to spread this piece of news at the first possible moment.Soon, near evening time, each and every person within the Lu Manor knew that Young Master Lu Sheng had returned, and even assessed that this spate of events was the work of man!Moreover, he had decided to keep watch during the night in Lily Flower Room!When this news spread, the entire Manor from the top to the bottom immediately heaved a great sigh of relief.These few days, the Lu Manor\u2019s denizens\u2019 tension had pent up to an extremely high level. Just like a string instrument\u2014if its strings were to be wound too tightly, they would break. Their nerves were not far from reaching that point.Momentarily, everyone felt a lot more at ease.Although the threat had not been averted, the atmosphere of fear and panic from before had relaxed quite a bit.Young Master was personally staying in the Lily Flower Room and could deal with the wailing, come what may. Even if something cropped up, Young Master would definitely be there to be the first one to deal with it.After enquiring into the entire incident from A to Z, Lu Sheng immediately sent someone to tidy up the Lily Flower Room and prepare some mattress and the like. He would stay there by himself tonight.Others tried to persuade him otherwise, but seeing that he had a steely resolve, they could only give up.Lu Sheng got Little Qiao to return to his original sleeping quarters. A saber in one hand and a pitcher of medicinal tea in another, he walked into the Lily Flower Room by himself.Lily Flower Room, Lily Leaf Room and Lotus Room were the three areas in the Manor designated as the servant girls\u2019 quarters. They were all packed closely together.Of them, Lily Flower Room was situated in the middle.Lu Sheng came before the Lily Flower Room with his saber in hand. Not a soul could be seen in the neighboring two yards; clearly, they were all frightened away by the wails during the night.He pushed open the door to find the place tidied up spotless and a bed arranged there nicely. A meal box was placed on the stone table in the little yard.Other than that, the whole place was deserted.Atop the greyish white stone table were still some traces of pink, which appeared to be the remnants spilt from the cosmetic powders women used.Lu Sheng eyed the sleeping quarters.The sleeping quarters and the little yard combined seemed to form a square box. The sleeping quarters were split into five individual units which were lined up together, the doorway acting as the corridor. He followed down the corridor and exited into the little yard, where he saw a well and a set of stone table and stools next to it.Lu Sheng sat next to the well like a big shot, all-imposing. He opened the dark-red meal box, taking out plates upon plates of side dishes and placing them all onto the stone table.There were three side dishes and one soup, coupled with steaming hot white rice.Picking up his chopsticks, Lu Sheng began to eat with relish.He took almost an hour to finish this one meal, cleaning up every last bit of that extravagant spread. Only then did he burp and come to a stop. [2]The sky gradually dimmed into the night. Lu Sheng lit some candles and lanterns by himself, casting the little yard and Sister Yu\u2019s sleeping quarters into bright light.The five sleeping quarters were arranged in a line, with Sister Yu\u2019s the furthest one in. The light that traveled within was limited, and sounds from outside that trailed in would also be reduced to a mere whisper.Lu Sheng finished his meal, walked down the corridor with a saber in hand, and entered the room.Inside the room there were a black wooden bed, a square table and three chairs. Besides those, there was a cupboard and a dressing table.Behind the dressing table was a window. Currently, the wooden window was half open, revealing the pitch-black alley outside.Candlelight on the study table just to the right of the entrance lit up half of the room, which instead contrasted with and emphasized the pitch black of the half open wooden window.Lu Sheng walked over and stuck his head outside the window to take a look.The alley beyond the window just happened to face one of the side doors to the Lu Manor.Looking out from the window, one could distinctly see that the straight alley led right up to a desolate-looking, white side door.[1] TL/ND: Qinggong (\u8f7b\u529f) refers to a type of movement skill that allows one to run at fast speeds, leap over great heights and even fly over short distances.[2] ED/N: While it is offensive in some countries (mainly in the West, including my own country), the Chinese apparently consider such \u201cnatural\u201d sounds made by the body normal and don\u2019t consider them offensive or something requiring an apology\u2026 or so I\u2019ve heard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Inside, he found a few pieces of dull-looking ladies\u2019 clothes Sister Yu used to wear. Closing the cupboard, Lu Sheng went over to examine the dressing table.The simple dressing table was devoid of any embellishments. Only a copper mirror was placed in the middle on top of it.Some pink powder was scattered in front of the copper mirror. Lu Sheng picked some up with his finger and held it up to his nose.\u2018Just normal women\u2019s cosmetic powder.\u2019Lu Sheng suddenly frowned.\u2018I remember that Sister Yu wasn\u2019t one to use cosmetic powder.\u2019\u201cHOO\u2026\u201dSuddenly, a gust of chilly air blew over, causing the candlelight to flicker unsteadily.Lu Sheng swiftly gripped his saber and surveyed the room.\u201cSWISH.\u201dFrom the gap left in the slightly ajar door, corner of a white robe flashed past.Lu Sheng quickly strode over.\u2018I clearly remember that I closed the door when I came in.\u2019He touched the wooden latch. An opened lock still hung from it. Opening the door, he stepped out into the corridor to take a look.It was cold and empty, without a single soul in sight.Cold air continuously gushed in his direction.Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze swept around once and discovered nothing amiss, so he returned to the room.\u201cKA-CHA!\u201d The door shut tight.Walking to the side of the table, he sat down and placed his saber on the tabletop, his hand still holding onto it.Thus, he sat as he waited for the supposed wail to echo within the room.The candlelight\u2019s lonely glow grew dim.Time passed gradually.With the support of Jade Crane Skill, Lu Sheng did not feel tired in the slightest. He remained vigilant as he sat beside the table, awaiting the wailing.After a while, since he had nothing to do, he accelerated the circulation of Jade Crane Skill at his will.This life-force skill was way too stable, anyway. There was no way it could be destabilized even if he wanted it to.A long period passed without his notice.Finally, a cockerel\u2019s sharp crow broke the silence. The darkness outside the window had gradually lifted, turning into a faint white.Only then did Lu Sheng all of a sudden realize that he had sat there for a whole night.\u2018Where\u2019s the woman\u2019s wail? There was nothing the whole night.\u2019Through the windows, he could see the faint rays of light cast by dawn.Lifting his saber, Lu Sheng stood up and stretched his body.He opened the door and walked out. Some light had penetrated the corridor. He came into the courtyard of the Lily Flower Room. The empty utensils from yesterday\u2019s meal lay there untouched.He could faintly hear people conversing outside the yard. Lu Sheng walked over and pushed the doors open with strength.His old Dad Lu Quanan, Lu Yingying, Lu Yiyi as well as his other family members had already been waiting outside for a while.Seeing the doors open, everyone jumped in shock and took a step back.But recognizing Lu Sheng, Lu Quanan hurriedly approached him.\u201cLittle Sheng! You okay!?\u201d His face was full of concern.Lu Sheng saw that everyone was carrying a torch. When some guards arrived, they were even holding unsheathed swords and sabers in their hands. Confusion arose in Lu Sheng\u2019s heart.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What happened?\u201d He asked loudly.Lu Quanan heaved a long sigh. \u201cLast night in our house, another person went missing.\u201d\u201cHUH???\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s eyes immediately opened wide.Second Mother Liu Cuiyu came forward and recounted the incident.It turned out that while Lu Sheng was keeping his night watch, the rest of the manor had come near and they, indeed, did not hear any woman\u2019s wail.At first, nothing was out of the ordinary. Those among the guards who were on patrol duty went on patrol as they were supposed to. Many people stayed in their rooms, saying that they would rest. But, actually, most of them could not sleep and stayed up to wait for the outcome.But then, something went wrong.\u201cBajun, he\u2026 he said he was going to the latrine, but he never came back\u2026\u201dA slightly rotund woman sobbed as she held a handkerchief.This woman was the sister of Lu Sheng\u2019s biological mother, Sun Yan. In other words, she was his little aunt, Sun Zining.The one who went missing this time was Lu Sheng\u2019s cousin\u2014Zhang Bajun.Lu Sheng was not on close terms with Zhang Bajun. This fella loved gambling and was a good-for-nothing. Lu Sheng disliked him and would often lecture him.Hence, the fella never liked Lu Sheng either and usually avoided him.Little did he expect that he was the one to go missing this time round. Lu Sheng\u2019s brows were locked in a furrow.\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep a wink at all last night. I sat in the room, listening for any sounds, but didn\u2019t hear any woman\u2019s wailing.\u201d Upon hearing his words, everybody\u2019s hearts grew cold.\u201cWhat on earth is going on!\u201dLittle aunt Sun Zining started to howl in tears.\u201cZining, don\u2019t get anxious. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something we can do,\u201d Second Mother pulled her aside to console her.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the Main Hall first. We\u2019ll discuss how to deal with this together,\u201d Lu Quanan sighed.Helpless, all they could do was to first leave this place.Lu Quanan gathered Lu Sheng and a few other immediate kin, including the eldest uncle.The doors to the Main Hall were shut tight. The few of them sat on their own seats, the mood gloomy and oppressive.Eldest Uncle Lu Anping was a thick-browed, big-eyed, square-jawed and sober-looking man.He wore a half-body silver-scale armor common during the Song Dynasty, with an ornamental curved saber on his waist. Sitting beside Lu Quanan, his face was solemn.\u201cThe question now is whether or not we should let the yamen authorities intervene,\u201d Eldest Uncle said slowly. \u201cIf we still can\u2019t find the source, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve got no choice but to borrow some external help.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easy to invite a god in, but hard to send a god out\u2026 ai!\u201d Lu Quanan sighed. This was the umpteenth time he had sighed today.In the last few days, he was taxed to his limits and now looked a lot more aged than he should.Lu Sheng sat on the lowest seat of honor, silent. [1]Lu Quanan looked at his son. \u201cLittle Sheng, have you got anything to say? You\u2019re the future head of the Lu family. In the future, the family estate and business will belong to you in their entirety. Under these circumstances, have you got any ideas about how we should solve this problem?\u201dLu Sheng shut his eyes for a while before opening them again, about to speak.\u201cBad news, bad news!\u201dLittle Qiao\u2019s voice suddenly rang out from outside the door.\u201cYoung Master! Brother Sheng! The men in the Manor are about to flee!\u201dLu Sheng rose immediately and strode towards the doors to open it. Little Qiao was waiting in front of the doors, her face flushed.\u201cYoung Master, with one more person missing in the Manor, the guard Commander Wang Chong seems to have fled in secret, leading quite a few men with him! I got the message from the sisters and hurriedly ran over to inform you.\u201d\u201cFled?\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s eyes glared.He had guessed that panic would spread and result in some people escaping. But never did he expect that it would happen so early.\u201cWhere\u2019s Wang Chong now?\u201d\u201cNo idea. We only realized it once they were gone. Zhao Fanghu and gang are now gathered in the courtyard. I\u2019m scared that they\u2019re thinking of running away too,\u201d Little Qiao hurriedly added.Zhao Fanghu was another leader among the guards and housemen.\u201cHow many of them are gathered?\u201d Lu Quanan rapidly asked.\u201cNot sure, but a lot!\u201d Little Qiao quickly replied.\u201cI\u2019ll go take a look!\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s face sank. He strode towards the courtyard. Lu Quanan and Eldest Uncle Lu Anping followed with dark faces as well.The few of them arrived at the courtyard soon after.Over twenty people had already gathered in the courtyard\u2014mostly housemen and guards, with a few servant ladies among them.Panic was written all over their faces.Some of them were already holding onto their packed luggage, ready to leave Lu Manor anytime.Upon seeing Lu Sheng and the rest arriving, the buzz and commotion among them died down slightly.\u201cWho wants to leave?\u201dLu Sheng walked to the front of the group and asked coldly.\u201cWe all do!\u201dA male guard stepped forward, happening to be none other than Zhao Fanghu. Fear and panic showed on his face.\u201cYoung Master, we\u2019re people too. We\u2019ve got lives as well! The trouble now in the Lu family isn\u2019t the work of man at all. It\u2019s a female ghost!\u201dHis eyes were wide open and filled with terror.\u201cAbsurd!\u201d Lu Sheng interrupted him sternly. \u201cWho gave you the guts to bewitch the rest with your wiles!\u201d\u201cBut I saw it myself! That white figure! You people from the Lu family, stop pulling us down with you into the gra\u2026\u201d\u201cSPLAT!\u201dBlood spilled all over the ground.The guard\u2019s head flew up into the air all of a sudden, landing on the ground with a thud and rolling to the foot of a servant-maid, who was carrying a bundle in her arms.\u201cDEATH to any who bewitches others with their lies!!!\u201dLu Sheng roared as he glared at the terrified group before him, his hand gripping his saber.\u201cTHUD.\u201dOnly then did the guard\u2019s headless corpse collapse onto the ground.\u201cAH!!!\u201dThe servant-maid screamed.\u201cSHUT UP!\u201dAn air of savagery emanated from Lu Sheng. As his gaze swept over, the maid, still in the middle of her scream, covered her mouth in shock and sobbed uncontrollably.When did the guards and housemen ever witness such a bloody scene?Every single one of them was shaken and in tremors; their faces turned as white as sheet of paper and none of them dared to make a single sound.\u201cGet back to your posts, all of you! I\u2019ll kill anyone who tries anything funny!\u201d Lu Sheng warned sternly.Deep fear showed in everyone\u2019s eyes.Compelled by Lu Sheng\u2019s tyranny, they then recalled that their young master was someone not to be trifled with as he had single-handedly killed several fugitives.In the blink of an eye, everyone dispersed as if they were on the run.Other guards who were not among those who had tried to flee earlier also cleaned up the corpse that collapsed onto the ground.All of these housemen, guards and servant ladies had signed a lifetime bond when they entered the service of the Manor.To think that they wanted to leave just like that! Did they really take the Lu family to be soft-hearted philanthropists?After everyone dispersed, Lu Sheng turned around only to see Lu Quanan and Eldest Uncle Lu Anping staring at him with surprised and complicated looks.\u201cExtreme measures for extreme times. That\u2019s just a stopgap measure,\u201d Eldest Uncle shook his head.\u201cWe just need to contain this for the time being. If we can\u2019t solve this in the short term, then even we ourselves need to go on the run,\u201d Lu Sheng said calmly.\u201cLooks like we really need to seek the yamen\u2019s help this time\u2026\u201d Lu Quanan sighed. \u201cGood thing we\u2019ve got you around this time, Little Sheng.\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s resolute handling of the situation proved to him that he was capable of shouldering responsibilities and displaying strategic thinking. That was a great comfort to him.Lu Sheng said with determination, \u201cTonight, let me keep another night watch. I want to see what on earth dares to make waves in my family! Father, don\u2019t worry. Although I didn\u2019t make any discoveries last night, I did notice a clue.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Lu Quanan\u2019s spirits lifted.\u201cAs real as it gets!\u201d\u201cDo you need me to dispatch some troops over?\u201d Eldest Uncle asked in all seriousness.\u201cNo hasty moves now. I\u2019m afraid that more men will drag us down. Nobody knows what these ghosts can do. The extra manpower may get in the way. They can stand guard outside the Manor,\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head.\u201cThat\u2019s true, Little Sheng. This time we\u2019re all counting on you!\u201d Eldest Uncle nodded and patted Lu Sheng on his shoulder.Despite being the Deputy Commander, he was after all not a man of the pugilistic world. Moreover, military officers of the Song Dynasty had not seen war in many years.In actual fact, his position was earned through paper examinations on strategy and tactics. There was no direct link to actual fighting.Privileging the civil office at the expense of the military had been a bad practice of the Song Dynasty for many years. Hence, right now, Lu Sheng became the backbone of the family.\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Lu Sheng recalled the corner of the white robe that he had seen. His intuition whispered to him a solution\u2014if he managed to capture the person under the white robe, perhaps the case of the missing persons could be resolved.[1] ED/N: Basically means that his position in the meeting is the lowest and he has the least seniority compared to everyone else.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This time, he went there when it was still day.Saber in hand, he searched around the entire room wordlessly.Then, after he had committed the shape and size of the room as well as the position of all the items within to his memory, he once again sat down inside.He calmly waited for the dusk to fall.The Lu Manor had been temporarily subdued by him, with none daring to entertain the thought of fleeing.After all, Nine Links City was only this big. Their only option would be to escape to Zi Hua City. However, with everyone else on high alert, monitoring the situation, none dared to be the first to try anything funny.They were all afraid that someone else would secretly blow the whistle on them in front of Young Master\u2014Lu Sheng had established that whoever reported a deserter would be awarded a hundred talents for each person reported!A hundred talents! If one reported ten people, that would be one thousand talents!Not many people would be able to earn such a vast sum, not even across their entire lives.Thus, for the time being, the situation in the Lu Manor was stabilized.Eldest Uncle had also deployed some soldiers to stand guard at each of the entrances of the Lu Manor, restricting anyone from leaving as they deemed fit.As for those who had escaped earlier, he also put up wanted posters in order to catch and bring them all back.After all that spate of busyness, the sky gradually dimmed.\u201cHOO\u2026\u201dStreams of air constantly circulated inside the house.Lu Sheng sat within Sister Yu\u2019s room, his hand gripping an unsheathed saber. His eyes were closed as if he were taking forty winks.He had not rested the entire last night. As he waited here during the day, it was also in this manner that he sat down to rest.Jade Crane Skill was indeed formidable. Even though he had not slept the whole night, he remained rather energetic.The rays from the sun slowly faded.Lu Sheng did not light the room. He sat there in the gloomy darkness, intending to completely recreate the usual conditions of the room.Light faded gradually as the place became darker and darker.Lu Sheng slowly adjusted by relying on his sense of hearing and paying attention to the movement of the air currents to observe his surroundings.Time trickled away in minutes and seconds.Soon, the sun had fully set and the room was cast in absolute pitch darkness. He could not even see his fingers stretched out in front of him.Nonetheless, Lu Sheng remained sitting there, stable as a rock.\u201cSwish\u2026\u201dSuddenly, the sound of clothes ruffling against each other drifted in from the door.It sounded like the faint swish of clothes, seemingly rubbing against the wooden surface of the wall.Lu Sheng opened his eyes. A faintly discernible blur of white shadow of a person could be seen in the dark, currently climbing in from the door.Because it was simply too dark, he could not see the features of the other party in detail. Only the fuzzy outline of a person clad in white could be seen.This person walked extremely slowly, at the speed of a crawl.In the dark, Lu Sheng felt as if the other party was smiling. He clearly could not see the facial features, but he could feel that the other party was smiling eerily.\u201cYou finally dare show yourself.\u201dLu Sheng stood up, both his eyes glowing ferociously.Black Fury Skill instantly circulated through his entire body; his body temperature shot up in an instant.\u201cHOO!\u201dSuddenly, the white shadow flung itself violently at him!\u201cDIEEE!!\u201dA glint flashed from the blade in Lu Sheng\u2019s hands.Black Tiger Saber\u2019s Tiger Might viciously slashed outwards to meet the incoming white shadow!In that moment, as the saber blade collided with the white shadow, his vision blurred and the whole room instantly became silent. There was nothing within earshot.Currently, the space in front of him was completely empty, with nothing in sight. His stroke had actually cut empty air!\u2018Such great speed!\u2019Without even thinking, Lu Sheng swung his long saber around him, viciously hacking at his surroundings maniacally.\u201cCHI!\u201dThe wooden clothes-rack that had been in the way was slashed in a single stroke, falling to the ground. The back of a chair was also split into two in a similar manner.He gave a cold snort, about to keep his saber and continue observing.Suddenly, he felt a cold sensation at the back of his head.Lu Sheng swung around madly. Unexpectedly, the white-robed figure was just a hair\u2019s breadth right behind him, hurling itself towards him.\u201cYou court death!!\u201dBlack Fury Skill mobilized at its highest capacity all over his body. Qi and blood pulsed wildly through him as his long saber abruptly unleashed the third move of Black Tiger Saber\u2014Tiger Roar.\u201cROAR!!!\u201dAs the full might of Black Fury Skill rushed through him, the saber blade even clearly emitted the deafening, ear-splitting roar of a tiger.The tiger roar shook all the items within the house, causing them to tremble and jiggle about.At once, that white shadow gave a miserable shriek similar to the shrill cry of a little girl. With a whoosh, it fled from the window.Not hesitating for even a moment, Lu Sheng calmed his raging Qi and blood as he sped off in pursuit.\u201cBANG!\u201dIn a stroke, he whacked the wooden window that was in his way, destroying it.His whole person seemed like a ferocious tiger emerging from its lair as he jumped out of the window into the alley.The white shadow moved at astonishing speed. With just a few twists and turns, it zoomed down the alley, past the junk that littered the place.Lu Sheng was in hot pursuit.\u201cBam! Bam!!!\u201dTwo piles of junk that were in his way immediately exploded under his two strokes.\u201cThere\u2019s some commotion inside! Is it Young Master?\u201dSome guards outside were shouting.Lu sheng\u2019s heart constricted.Then, he saw some guards on the night watch near the side door.One of them turned to look in his direction, his face taut with fear as he held onto a saber.Lu Sheng didn\u2019t even have time to say anything. The white shadow sped forward with terrifying speed and entered the body of one of the guards.\u201cALL DISPERSE!\u201d He thundered in rage. The mad rush of his Qi and blood once again caused his saber blade to emit a sound like the immense roar of a massive tiger.\u201cHOWL!\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s entire person pounced forward forcefully, slashing out with Tiger Roar!\u201cDANG!\u201dVeins rapidly surfaced all over the skin of the guard whose body the white shadow had entered. He raised his hand to dodge the attack.Startlingly, he was actually able to precisely block Lu Sheng\u2019s saber move.Two blades collided at full impact. In that instant, Lu Sheng felt strength not inferior to that of his own resist him furiously.Looking at the guard again, he saw that both his eyes had already rolled back. Both eyes were without any black, leaving behind but a patch of miserable white.\u2018Possession?\u2019Lu Sheng extended his saber once again, heading straight for the guard\u2019s neck.\u201cDANG!\u201dAgain, he was blocked.The guard who had been possessed had drastically grown in might. Lu Sheng traded blows with him with his saber.Both men dueled back and forth with their sabers, causing a cacophony of clanging sounds as metal hit against each other. It was a deafening din.The other two guards at the side door were scared beyond their wits, hurriedly fleeing far away with tails between their legs.The din and commotion attracted the attention of quite a number of other guards and servants, who rushed over.Under the rush of the Black Fury Qi, Lu Sheng\u2019s strength grew by an entire measure as he continued to duel with the possessed guard for over ten moves.Gradually, the poison from the Black Fury Skill slowly permeated the guard\u2019s palms, causing his strength to steadily decrease and weaken.The second level of Black Fury Skill was indeed as powerful as Lu Sheng had expected, poisonous beyond comparison.\u201cSPEAK! WHO SENT YOU?\u201d Lu Sheng charged forth brutally in a swift saber attack, hacking into the guard\u2019s saber blade.A massive wave of strength thundered through the possessed guard\u2019s body, making it shake violently. His body turned limp and numb in an instant, causing his movements to slow by a beat.\u201cBANG!\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s other hand attacked with a penetrating palm strike to the heart, exploiting the opening to land a blow straight to the guard\u2019s chest.He had long prepared to strike with Heart-Shattering Palm as a premeditated follow-up move.\u201cAH!!!\u201dThe guard shrieked miserably as the attack landed smack on his chest. A mouthful of blood gushed out madly from his mouth as his body was thrown up into the air before falling onto the ground in a heap.A flash of white shadow flew out from the guard\u2019s body towards the nearest of those who had come to check out the situation.This time round, it was actually a servant girl.Perhaps because the shadow was far too near Lu Sheng, it had no other choice, being able to only choose somebody to enter at random.The servant girl had only just been possessed, her skin turning red, when Lu Sheng rushed over.With a turn of his hand, he struck with a backhand slash without warning!\u201cCHI!\u201dThe powerful saber blade hacked into the servant girl\u2019s body savagely and her entire body was flung into the air, blood splattering all over the floor.\u201cEVERYONE GET FAR AWAY FROM HERE! DON\u2019T COME NEAR!\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s voice boomed.And yet, it was too late. Once again, a few other guards had dashed over, sabers in hand.The white shadow flew out in a flash, yet again entering into another body.\u201cAH!!!\u201d Lu Sheng bellowed in rage, pushing the Black Tiger Saber Technique\u2019s momentum to its maximum under the thrust of Black Fury Skill.The incensed roar of a mighty tiger once again sounded out around him.His long saber slashed out at full strength like a giant boulder smashing into the ground, carrying with it the intense howling of the wind.The guard who had been possessed instantly turned in the direction beyond the side door, as if thinking of escaping.\u201cRUMBLE!\u201dLu Sheng actually destroyed the walls of the yard near the side door in one ferocious stroke.Blade in hand, he charged through the broken wall and, in one vicious stroke, struck the skull of the possessed guard who had been caught off guard.\u201cAH, AH, AHHH!!!\u201dA woman\u2019s shrill, tragic cries rang out.The guard\u2019s skull had been butchered into two, with bits of red and white splattered all over. Yet, he was still able to extend his hand and land a forceful blow with his palm onto Lu Sheng\u2019s lower abdomen.\u201cBANG!\u201dLu Sheng fell back two steps, breathing heavily like an ox. A dense demonic aura permeated his whole body as an eerie blush flashed across his face.A bit of blood could be seen oozing from the corners of his mouth.Lu Sheng once again raised his saber, but heard a clanging sound as the saber blade broke apart and fell to the ground.He decided that he might as well throw the saber away, instead lunging forth to deliver two consecutive palm strikes.This time round, the middle of his palms actually turned into a faint black under the activation of Black Fury Skill as he used Heart-Shattering Palm to strike.\u201cBAM, BAM!\u201dTwo thuds sounded out before the white shadow once again floated out from the guard\u2019s body.She still wanted to run.However, Lu Sheng moved his Black Fury Skill-infused palm to grab onto her clothes. Immediately, he felt as if he had grasped onto a block of ice.However, Qi, blood, and the Black Fury Qi that were coursing wildly through his entire body made him unafraid of this icy coldness in the least.The second level of the Black Fury Qi within him rushed madly towards the white shadow\u2019s clothes in his hands.\u201cDIEEE!!!\u201dLu Sheng exploded with all his power and hit out with abandon in that palm strike.All the Black Fury Qi in his body seemed desperate to be released in this palm strike.\u201cBAM!!!\u201d\u201cAH!!!\u201dEventually, the white shadow let out a high-pitched scream as it was hit on the chest, causing her whole shape to instantly distort. With a \u2018chi\u2019 sound like that of shredding a piece of cloth into countless pieces, it exploded in an instant and vanished.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes bore great killing intent. With a plop, he fell into a half-kneeling position on the ground.He promptly spat out a mouthful of black blood.Hands still shaking, he grabbed onto the broken saber on the floor and stabbed it into the ground unsteadily to support himself.Jade Crane Skill and Black Fury Skill were spinning madly within him in an attempt to heal the injuries his body had suffered.Because he had taken a blow earlier and over-exerted his strength, his meridians were unable to bear the pressure and became covered with a number of small cracks.With both these serious injuries stacked on top of the other, Lu Sheng was unable to support himself any longer now that he relaxed his Qi and blood.After a long time had passed, the guards and housemen who had scurried far into the distance finally dared to come near. By then, Lu Quanan and the rest of the people had also rushed to the scene.Everyone was in a spate of shock when they saw the utter chaos at the scene.Then, they saw that Lu Sheng was half-kneeling on the ground, some blood on the corners with his mouth and another patch on the floor; clearly, he had just spat it out.Lu Quanan ran over hastily.\u201cLittle Sheng! Are you alright? Call the physician, quick!!!\u201d Anxiety could be seen on his face. He held onto Lu Sheng as he turned around and bellowed, \u201cWhat are you standing there for! COME HELP!!\u201dThe others seemed to finally awaken from their stupor and hurried forward to help lift Lu Sheng.Eldest Uncle looked over the broken saber on the ground, the corpses, as well as the wall that had been broken through.Then, he turned to look at Lu Sheng, who was still billowing with killing intent as he panted badly. A slight shudder shook in his heart.How could his nephew of just ten over years old have caused this scene? In fact, it was comparable to the work of the ferocious beasts from the mountain forests!He had once chanced upon a black bear roaming the mountains and personally witnessed its might when it barged into a house. It had then caused a scene of devastation that was not unlike the one before his eyes.\u201cAbout what happened tonight, no one is to spread it beyond these walls! Otherwise\u2026\u201d Eldest Uncle Lu Anping glared coldly at the group of people around.\u201cCome, clean up the mess. Do your best not to leave behind any traces.\u201dThe guards and housemen felt a chill down their spine as he glared at them. Moreover, with the corpses before them as deterrence, none of them dared to dispute his words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He\u2019s just physically spent and also suffered a heavy blow to his abdomen. Young Master is strong and sturdy; as long as there are no internal injuries, it\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201dOnly then did Lu Quanan sigh in relief.It was really too rash for Lu Sheng to have personally intervened this time. He was the Young Master of the Lu Family. If some mishap had happened to him, who would they rely on in the future?\u201cQuanan, this was our only resort,\u201d Eldest Uncle sighed. \u201cI intend to skip the Prefect and personally report what happened here to the court. As the parent official of an entire city, that Song Duanchi had previously already promised to report this matter to the court, but until now, he still\u2026 as the Deputy Commander, I had on several occasions requested Commander Yang Duanrui to file a report, but he always came back with excuses.\u201d\u201cCould there be more to this than meets the eye?\u201d Lu Quanan asked softly.\u201cNot sure\u2026 and we\u2019ve still not heard from that lass Qingqing as well as those who went missing,\u201d Eldest Uncle shook his head.Both of them stood outside the door, feeling that they should do something, yet without a clue what they could do.The gravity of this incident had far surpassed their imagination.Although they had previously heard of such incidents happening in other places, when it fell on their own house, they were at a loss of what to do.\u201cHow about\u2026\u201d Lu Quanan hesitated, \u201cwe offer a reward to hire people trained to deal with this sort of supernatural things?\u201d\u201cCourage is born under the incentive of gold. This may work. Anyway, these incidents are now the talk of the city. There\u2019s no way we can cover them up,\u201d Eldest Uncle nodded.After discussing in detail, both of them settled on the decision.Not long after, Lu Manor servants each carried a stack of red paper and pasted it outside the Lu Manor\u2019s main doors as well as the public noticeboard nearby.Rapidly, the sheets of red paper appeared in several important locations with high traffic volume, attracting more than a few stares.***Several days later, the city gate.On the busy main path covered with commuting travelers and carriages, a team of merchants pulling along grey cargo came to a slow halt as they reached the city gate. The leader of the merchant team began supervising the unloading of the goods.This merchant team was merely passing by Nine Links City and so only a fraction of the goods were being unloaded.As the leader supervised, two figures jumped down from a carriage\u2014one tall and the other short.Both wore Taoist robes. The taller between them was a middle-aged man with a red, square face. A sword was strapped to his back and he wore white cloth shoes with black soles.The other, a lady, was also dressed in a Taoist robe but looked pretty. Despite a trace of fatigue on her face, her demeanor remained characteristic of the well-educated. In these times, only one born in a wealthy family would appear as such.\u201cBrother Yan, this in Nine Links City.\u201dThe lady\u2019s voice was clear, like that of an eleven or twelve-year-old girl whose voice had only just broken.\u201cMm. Should be the Nine Links City that he spoke of. It\u2019s been tough on you this whole journey, Rongrong,\u201d the Taoist nodded and surveyed the surroundings.Quickly, he noticed a red paper announcement pasted on the city gate.The announcement had drawn a large crowd of onlookers. Even the two sentry guards had approached to chat with the people there.Everybody wore looks of envy and surprise.\u201cIt\u2019s not tough at all to be travelling with Brother Yan Kai! That announcement looks like an offer of reward. Let\u2019s go take a look. Maybe somebody has already encountered trouble and posted a request for help.\u201dRongrong had followed Yan Kai on many adventures and was rather experienced with such situations.In the previous few cases they had handled, they had gotten in contact with the people in trouble through the posted notices too.Yan Kai nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ll take a look.\u201dThe two of them neared the city gate and squeezed their way towards the notice.\u201c\u2026So it\u2019s the Lu Manor\u2026 it\u2019s really been eventful lately in the city. Even the Lu Family is now in trouble.\u201d\u201cLu Family\u2026 just a while back, some of theirs fled. I caught a glance. I think it was the Lu Family\u2019s ex-guard commander. The entire manor is in panic.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a few days since I last saw Sister Yu out on errands. Could something really have happened?\u201dThe crowd exchanged comments and continued chatting here and there.Listening carefully, Yan Kai looked at the notice pasted on the gate.It read:\u201cReward of five hundred gold for people with special skills and talent for hire.Lately, too many strange incidents have been occurring in the city, with people often going missing.Earlier, there were also the Xu Family tragic case, the Wang villa well incident and now my Lu Manor\u2019s midnight woman\u2019s wail.For the sake of peace in the family, we hereby offer five hundred talents of gold, worth approximately five thousand talents in silver, in return for thoroughly investigating the matter and locating the missing persons.\u201dThe notice was simple, its meaning clear and to the point.A second poster was also pasted underneath it, detailing from beginning to end the process of how the Lu Manor had encountered the midnight wail.It thoroughly recounted the cases of missing persons that had occurred in the Lu Manor.Yan Kai read in detail and his brows were locked in a furrow.\u201cThat\u2019s it. We\u2019re going to the Lu Family.\u201dRongrong had just finished reading the contents of the notice too.\u201cIt just so happens that we\u2019re looking for ghosts. And we can also earn some quick money along the way.\u201d\u201cWe do not practice our arts for the sake of money,\u201d Yan Kai remarked solemnly.\u201cYes, yes, yes,\u201d Rongrong stuck out her tongue and shut her mouth hurriedly. She knew that Brother Yan Kai could not tolerate those who helped others with the expectation of getting something in return.Without a further word, Yan Kai stepped forward to tear the notice down.The Lu Manor houseman on duty beside it came to life immediately.\u201cSir and Ma\u2019am, this way please!\u201dYan Kai nodded.Bringing Rongrong with him, he followed the houseman towards the Lu Manor.The crowd of onlookers immediately went \u201cooh\u201d and \u201cahh\u201d, with more than a few busybodies even following them for a stretch to see if they were truly going to the Lu Family.It seemed like this couple dressed in Taoist robes really had some tricks up their sleeves.Not caring a hoot about whether or not people followed them, Yan Kai walked on without the slightest change in expression. Clearly, he had long since been used to being watched by spectators.In the meantime, Rongrong actively struck up a conversation with the houseman, inquiring about the Lu Manor\u2019s recent situation.Not long after, both of them boarded a horse carriage, which turned left and right before coming to a halt.Once the two of them alighted, someone was already present to lead them in. They walked into a gigantic manor, decorated with artificial mountains and flowing rivers, small bridges and gardens\u2026 and so on. With birds chirping and the fragrance of flowers wafting in the air, the setup of the manor was extremely intricate and luxurious.Yan Kai walked on with Rongrong in tow without so much as a glance. Quickly, they arrived in the Guest Hall.\u201cWelcome, welcome.\u201dA middle-aged man, looking troubled and slightly pale, was sitting in the Guest Hall.The man looked plump and was dressed in a silver-bordered light blue robe embroidered with coin motifs. The long beard hanging off his chin was neat and clean.It was none other than Lu Quanan, who had just come from meeting with Lu Sheng.\u201cAre both of you the ones who tore down the notice on the city gate?\u201d Lu Quanan sized up the two standing before him.Both were Taoists. The man\u2019s face was red and well-nourished. His forehead was prominent, eyes sober and back straight. If he was wearing a set of scholar\u2019s robes, he would likely possess the air of a noble gentleman.The lady was pretty and slightly wide-eyed, appearing somewhat innocent. Her bright eyes stole glances in all directions, making her look as if she was a little miss who had run out of a prominent family and disguised herself.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Just a lowly Taoist, Yan Kai. Yan as in \u2018colour\u2019 (\u989c); Kai as in \u2018open\u2019 (\u5f00). My Taoist name is Huanyang-Zi,\u201d Yan Kai introduced himself. \u201cThis is my junior sister Duan Rongrong. Both of us are here because of the missing persons case.\u201d\u201cPlease take a seat, please sit,\u201d Lu Quanan gestured.Both of them sat and servant-maids swiftly served tea and snacks.\u201cI\u2019ve written about the incident in detail on the notice. If Taoist Huanyang-Zi would like to receive this reward, you\u2019ll have to meet my son Lu Sheng. He\u2019s the one in charge of assessing the candidates for my Lu Family\u2019s reward this time,\u201d Lu Quanan said softly. \u201cOf course, if Taoist truly has the skills, then regardless of the outcome of this matter, we\u2019ll offer up a hundred talents of silver after this.\u201dBoth Yan Kai and Duan Rongrong were in agreement with this.Lu Quanan enquired further regarding their backgrounds\u2014where they were from, their age, where they currently resided, etc.Yan Kai answered each question in turn.After a short rest, the Guest Hall was filled with a few others who had torn the notices down as well.Among those who came subsequently, two of them were monks from the Red Lotus Temple. There was also a Taoist like Yan Kai.The last of them was a travelling adventurer. A pair of twin sabers hung by his waist, both short sabers. His facial features were pretty and if one looked closely, one would realize that \u201che\u201d was actually a \u201cshe\u201d in disguise.After waiting for a while longer, it seemed to Lu Quanan that all who would come had come. Without further ado, he led the party to the side yard where Lu Sheng was.The Lu Manor comprised of many side yards, occupying a large plot of land. A portion of the manor even stretched towards the city wall, occupying a whole third of Nine Links City\u2019s most prosperous sector. That went to show how well endowed they were.It wasn\u2019t surprising\u2014among the five great families of the city, the Lu Family was the wealthiest.The party followed Lu Quanan towards the Yellow Crane Courtyard.Along the way, guards and housemen armed with sabers and swords were in full view, stationed everywhere between the courtyards.Each of the guards and housemen was well-built and muscular, standing with impeccable bearing. A single glance revealed that they had undergone military training.As Yan Kai looked on, his face grew solemn. \u201cThis Lu Family is not to be trifled with\u2026\u201dDuan Rongrong was puzzled by his words.\u201cAren\u2019t they just rich? Pretty much similar to the families we encountered previously. What\u2019s the big deal about them?\u201dYan Kai shook his head.\u201cNot just that. The Lu Family probably has a military background. Otherwise, the housemen and guards here would not possess such an aura. The military has strict rules. Only those who went through regular military training can maintain such spirit and vigil. They\u2019re not like old retired soldiers.\u201d\u201cMilitary background! And to think that even such a family would need to request for help. Looks like they\u2019re really in big trouble,\u201d Duan Rongrong clicked her tongue.The party walked over a hundred steps and quickly entered the Yellow Crane Courtyard.The Yellow Crane Courtyard was right beside the arena. They could even hear the commands and shouts coming from the arena on which the guards were presently training.The Young Master of the Lu Family\u2014Lu Sheng\u2014was sitting on a reclining chair in a half-sitting position. His face was pale and body wrapped in a thick fur blanket. Strong medicinal smell wafted in the air. He didn\u2019t seem to be in high spirits.Yan Kai carefully sized up Lu Sheng. One glance told him that the Qi and vigor in his eyes were dim and faint, like that of a patient who had yet to recover.\u201cGreetings to you, brave men,\u201d Lu Sheng coughed twice as he clasped his hands together at the party. \u201cAs is evident to all of you, my physical condition is unwell. I\u2019ve yet to recover from my injuries so please forgive me for not rising to welcome all of you.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Sheng is too polite.\u201dOne of the monks from Red Lotus Temple, named Master True Depths, stepped forward and spoke.\u201cLu Family has always been one of the devout patrons of my Red Lotus Temple. Now that you\u2019re in trouble, the abbot has instructed us to make a trip here to see if we can lend a helping hand.\u201d\u201cMany thanks, Master. Please thank the Red Lotus Abbot on my behalf as well,\u201d Lu Sheng replied with a smile.The other Taoist began to inquire about the case.Lu Sheng answered each of his questions.While listening carefully on the side, Yan Kai was also carefully examining Lu Sheng.\u201cHe\u2019s injured because his body was invaded by Yin Qi. And that also just recently,\u201d Yan Kai deducted from his careful observation of this Young Master Lu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A stone appeared in his hand from god-knows-where. Then, he squeezed his hand closed with sudden force.\u201cSwoosh\u2026\u201dFine stone dust immediately trickled down the gaps between his fingers and, immediately being carried away by the wind.The party around him stared in shock.Clearly, this was a feat that not even the strongest experts in Nine Links City could perform.The travelling adventurer who was a woman-in-disguise was now staring especially solemnly at the Taoist.Even Yan Kai regarded this Taoist with increased respect.To possess the strength to crush stone into dust demanded extremely strong inner force. Never would he have expected to find one such expert in this place.Low shouts of surprise escaped the mouths of the housemen, guards and servant-maids standing around.Lu Sheng stared at the Taoist without so much as a word. Only a frown appeared on his face.The Taoist chuckled. \u201cHow\u2019s that, Young Master? Does my ability meet your standards?\u201dLu Sheng slowly breathed out.Then, his eyes turned cold and stern all of a sudden.\u201cThis is clearly the scent of Stone-Congealing Powder! You swindler! Where are you from and how dare you make a fool of me! Arrest him!\u201dEveryone around was dumbfounded.Before they could react, two muscular guards pounced on the Taoist, pressing him onto the ground.The Taoist screamed and struggled to no avail under the weight of two men. No sign of the immense force capable of crushing stones into powder manifested.He was simply just an ordinary man.\u201cYoung Master, how shall we deal with him? Should we inform the yamen authorities?\u201d A muscular guard on the side asked. He was one of the guards who had personally seen Young Master\u2019s divine might when he destroyed the female ghost on the previous night. Thus, he was now thoroughly converted as Young Master Lu Sheng\u2019s diehard loyalist.Lu Sheng looked in disgust at the Taoist struggling on the ground.\u201cNo need for that. Just pull him out and behead him.\u201d\u201cNO, DON\u2019T! Young Master, I just fell into a moment\u2019s folly, wanting to earn some extra money! I was out of my mind!\u201dUpon hearing his words, the Taoist was immediately sent into shock and begged to be spared at the top of his voice. His whole body trembled like a reed in the wind, his face as white as a sheet of paper and drenched in cold sweat.\u201cYoung Master, spare my life!!!\u201d\u201cYes sir!\u201dThe guard did not care about his pleas and had his men drag the Taoist out of the courtyard.There was also an execution room specially prepared beside the arena.Given the Lu Family\u2019s immense wealth and power, the yamen would close an eye when the Lu Family executed a couple of people on its own authority.Yan Kai and the rest looked on in shock and fear as the man was dragged out. Quickly, a faint tragic scream rang out from outside.\u201cAlright, gentlemen. Now that we\u2019ve dealt with the phony, may I please have the next person to demonstrate his ability,\u201d Lu Sheng recovered the gentle smile that was previously on his face.The remaining few now had a deeper understanding of the temperament of this Young Master of the Lu Family.Though he looked frail and sickly, he would turn into a monster in the blink of an eye. He acted decisively and without mercy\u2026 truly, he was one not to be trifled with.After a moment\u2019s silence, the second person to step forward was Master True Depths of Red Lotus Temple. This master\u2019s hands were shaking, but he still mustered his courage and stepped forward.\u201cI\u2026 This humble monk suddenly remembered that there are urgent matters to be settled in the temple\u2026\u201d Facing Lu Sheng, Master True Depths broke out into a cold sweat as he spoke.Unexpectedly, he stepped forward not in order to demonstrate his abilities, but to retreat!The younger monk behind him fared even worse. Not only was cold sweat tricking down his forehead, his face was ashen white and both his knees buckled against each other incessantly.\u201cSince Master has matters to attend to, please take your leave first.\u201dLu Sheng smiled, remaining polite and gentle. He quickly instructed a servant-maid to lead Master True Depths and the monk to the exit without making things difficult for them.Within a short while, three people were gone.Only three were left\u2014the travelling adventurer and the Yan Kai duo.\u201cLet me go next.\u201dThe travelling adventurer who was a lady-in-disguise stepped forward and pulled out the twin sabers on her waist.\u201cMy forte is qinggong, short-range and long-range pursuit as well as tracking and investigations. Should be of help when looking for missing persons.\u201d\u201cOh? In that case, may I know how to address you, Miss?\u201d Lu Sheng smiled.\u201cZhuan Feng.\u201d\u201cChuan Feng?\u201d Lu Sheng was stunned.The female travelling adventurer quickly scribbled two words on the stone desk with her finger.Only then did everyone understand that her last name was \u201cZhuan\u201d. [1]\u201cSo, Miss Zhuan Feng, may I know how you\u2019re going to demonstrate your expertise?\u201dCuriosity appeared on Lu Sheng\u2019s face.Zhuan Feng sniffed and squatted down to carefully examine the surface of the ground. Then, she put her ear close to the ground to listen.Before long, she arose and opened her mouth to deliver her assessment.\u201cI can determine that, Young Master Lu, you and your men have been in this side yard for no more than four hours.From beginning to end, there should have been two batches of guards and servant-maids who came in and out to clean the place. The total number of people was less than ten and it should have taken place about two hours ago.Only after that did Young Master arrive. Moreover, neither Young Master nor anyone around you entered the rooms in this side yard. Clearly, this yard was specially set up just in time for the purpose of assessing us. Not even you had the time to enter the rooms.\u201dImmediately, Lu Sheng and the rest opened their eyes wide in astonishment. Not only them, the guards and the servant-maids standing by around them looked as if they had just seen a ghost.Merely by bending down towards the ground, looking, listening and sniffing, she was able to deduce so many facts!This Miss Zhuan Feng was indeed an extraordinary talent!\u201cImpressive!\u201d Lu Sheng clapped lightly.\u201cMiss Zhuan Feng, regardless of how you determined all those, you\u2019ve passed. Next would be these two persons\u2026\u201d He looked towards the duo including Yan Kai.While Yan Kai handled his gaze well, Duan Rongrong\u2019s hair stood on ends as Young Master Lu\u2019s gaze shot in her direction.Just a moment ago, he was all filled with smiles. In the very next second, he had turned into a devil and had the Taoist beheaded.Even if such a man were to smile at you, how could you be certain that he wouldn\u2019t put you to death in the very next second?In her mind, Duan Rongrong had already labeled this Young Master Lu as a highly dangerous character.Yan Kai, however, remained composed as he stepped forward.\u201cIf I have not guessed wrongly,\u201d he stared at Lu Sheng with eyes full of vigor, \u201cYoung Master Lu\u2019s injuries were caused by Yin Qi invasion, am I right?\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s brows raised. Now he was really getting interested.This man before him seemed like he really knew a thing or two.\u201cYour wound should be on your abdomen. But, thankfully, it did not reach your internal organs. However, with Yin Qi invading your body, if you do not purge it, it will eventually damage your Yang Qi.This is a bit of Yang Returning Potion concocted by your humble Taoist. If Young Master\u2019s got the guts, you can try consuming it to test its effects.\u201dHe retrieved a black porcelain bottle from his sleeve and handed it over.A servant-maid on the side hurriedly received it and placed it on a plate before delivering it over to Lu Sheng.\u201cRemember to return me the bottle after drinking,\u201d Yan Kai added.Lu Sheng looked at the porcelain bottle. He pulled out the wooden cork and held it up to his nose for a sniff.Just a sniff alone made him feel as if much of the Yin coldness in his body had been purged. A fiery scent wafted into his nostrils from the bottle, making him feel hot all over.It was indeed true that he started having the shivers even since he got back to his room to rest after the blow to his abdomen. The wounds on his body were secondary. His main concern was that the strand of Yin coldness had infiltrated his body. Regardless of what tonics that supplemented Yang he consumed or how he worked out under the sun, it was useless in getting rid of it.Although there would be some warming effects on his body right after he had consumed Yang-supplementing tonic or worked out, that Yin coldness would come back the moment he rested.Looking at the porcelain bottle in front of him, Lu Sheng smiled and emptied it into his mouth without hesitation.A faint taste of rust flooded his mouth, accompanied by a spicy, piquant flavor. A gush of heat slid down his throat.Lu Sheng breathed out slowly. His entire body was flooded with warmth, as though he was under a hot summer day\u2019s sun at noon; it was extremely comfortable.The Yin coldness from before melted rapidly like snow under the heat of the summer day. Before long, it was no longer perceptible.\u201cTaoist-sir, you\u2019re indeed impressive,\u201d Lu Sheng knew at that moment that he had run into an expert. \u201cThis bottle of Yang Returning Potion will be factored into your compensation.\u201d\u201cDoes that count as a pass?\u201d Yan Kai asked.\u201cOf course! The three of you, please follow me.\u201dLu Sheng rose slowly, supported by guards. He led the three of them into the inner house in the Yellow Crane Courtyard.The servant-maids and guards departed, leaving only that muscular guard beside Lu Sheng.\u201cKa-cha.\u201dThe door shut tight.Only five people stood in the room.\u201cHere are the specifics of what happened\u2026\u201dLu Sheng began recounting the flow of events, starting from the first case of missing persons.Yan Kai and the rest of them listened meticulously, inquiring about some detail every now and then.Everything that Lu Sheng knew, he replied in turn. What he did not know was supplemented by the muscular guard beside him.The conversation lasted for a whole hour.After understanding the situation, Yan Kai bowed his head as he fell deep in thought.A moment later, he lifted his head again.\u201cThe supernatural beings that Young Master ran into, this humble Taoist names them Demonic Ghosts.\u201d\u201cDemonic Ghosts?\u201d Lu Sheng asked. This counted as his first foray into the mysterious side of this world.\u201cDemon Ghosts, Demonic Ghosts. In themselves, they\u2019re not formed by souls of people who have passed on per se. Rather, they\u2019re formed by the bitterness, jealousy, hatred, injustice\u2026 and other emotions of humans. These emotions absorb some mysterious power from the environment, congealing into ghosts,\u201d Yan Kai explained solemnly. \u201cDealing with one or two Demonic Ghosts is a small matter. But if left alone for a long time, they will spread like a virus, killing more people and then forming new Demonic Ghosts. From the density of Yin Qi on Young Master, the Demonic Ghosts that you were in contact with had been left alone for a long time.\u201d\u201cFor a long time? In that case, wouldn\u2019t there be more Demonic Ghosts in Nine Links City?\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s face grew serious.\u201cHighly possible,\u201d Yan Kai nodded. \u201cAlright, leave this matter to me. I\u2019ll deal with it. Young Master needs only to rest and recover at home. But this humble Taoist is only responsible for dealing with the Demonic Ghosts. As for finding the missing persons\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll find the missing persons,\u201d Zhuan Feng said. \u201cWhen it comes to these supernatural encounters, I\u2019ve had a couple of experiences with them in the past too.\u201dLu Sheng nodded in assent.\u201cIn that case, Taoist-sir, what else can I do to help you?\u201dNow he was fully convinced that this Taoist Yan Kai must be one of those rumored professionals.\u201cDemonic Ghosts are not something that you can handle. The pressing matter at hand for you is to move out of Nine Links City immediately since you\u2019ve made contact with them, lest you become fodder for the Demonic Ghosts to feed on,\u201d Yan Kai said plainly. \u201cIn addition, we\u2019ve come also in order to investigate the Xu family\u2019s massacre.\u201d\u201cI also want to help in any way I can,\u201d Lu Sheng said earnestly.\u201cI\u2019ve already said that it\u2019s unnecessary. Numbers won\u2019t help when it comes to ordinary men. Even if you\u2019re trained in some martial arts, you\u2019ll only become a burden to us. Martial arts have no use at all against ghosts!\u201dYan Kai replied unceremoniously with a frown.Beside him, Duan Rongrong broke out in a cold sweat, fearful that they had angered Young Master Lu\u2026Lu Sheng was about to speak, but was cut off by Yan Kai.\u201cAlright, no need to speak any further. This isn\u2019t something that you ordinary men can participate in.\u201d[1] TL/N: The reason why everyone heard Zhuan Feng\u2019s name as Chuan Feng at first was because Chuan Feng (\u4f20\u98ce) literally means \u201cpassage of wind\u201d in Chinese, which is apt for someone with her skill as a fast tracker. Lu Sheng and the rest were surprised by the uncanny aptness of this name. This also explains their later reaction when they realized her name was actually Zhuan Feng.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If any help is needed, you can approach all the clothes shop, pharmacies, blacksmiths in the city. They\u2019ll all lend you their assistance.\u201d\u201cThat works too,\u201d Yan Kai nodded. \u201cAlright, since that\u2019s settled, we\u2019ll make a move first. First order of business is to examine the Lily Flower Room.\u201d\u201cPlease be my guest,\u201d Lu Sheng smiled.\u201cI\u2019ll go too,\u201d the female adventurer Zhuan Feng said as she followed them.Watching the trio leave, Lu Sheng gave the order to permit them free access to the entire Lu Manor. None was to intercept them.\u201cLittle Sheng, do you think those three will be of use?\u201d Lu Quanan had just entered through the door and had heard their exchange earlier.\u201cWhether or not they\u2019ll be of use doesn\u2019t matter. Simply by being able to see through my wounds and curing me with a bottle of potion it was worth us spending this sum of money,\u201d Lu Sheng replied.\u201cI give you full authority to oversee this matter. The entire Manor, myself included, will take orders from you. So just do as you deem fit!\u201d Lu Quanan said in all seriousness.\u201cThanks, Dad,\u201d Lu Sheng replied with a smile.After Lu Quanan left, Lu Sheng returned to his bedroom and had Little Qiao feed him with nourishing bird\u2019s nest by the spoon. [1]Ever since he was injured, he had not seriously upgraded his martial arts.After all, to expend energy and Qi to upgrade his martial arts with his body damaged was to court death, not to seek strength.With the Yin Qi now purged from his body, however, he began thinking about how he should plan his future development.While drinking bird\u2019s nest, Lu Sheng sat on the rattan chair in his courtyard, his eyes closed and body reclining lazily.\u201cYoung Master, Miss Qingqing has already not returned for a few days. Could she have\u2026?\u201d Little Qiao asked softly with a face full of worry.\u201cDon\u2019t be anxious. There\u2019s no use in getting anxious. Leave these professional matters to the professionals to deal with. Even if we went along, we\u2019d just be getting in the way,\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s just that when I see Second Mistress crying her heart out every day, it breaks my heart too,\u201d Little Qiao whispered. \u201cYoung Master, do you think they\u2019re up to it?\u201d\u201cThey should be able to dig some things up. As for how much, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d Lu Sheng replied casually. His mind, however, was on whether or not Yan Kai\u2019s words were true.Thinking it through in detail, the Taoist had no reason to lie. If he was out to swindle money, just that bottle of Yang Returning Potion would have been enough to make him a handsome profit.With such people handling the issue now, there was no need to get anxious indeed, especially since the Demonic Ghost in Lu Manor had been dealt with. They were safe for the time being.It\u2019s just that, according to Yan Kai, there still remained more than a few Demonic Ghosts in Nine Links City.Immediately, a thick sense of danger rose in Lu Sheng\u2019s heart.Previously, it had already taken all his might to deal with just one Demonic Ghost. Had there been a few more\u2026\u201cLeave first. I want some quiet and rest,\u201d Lu Sheng suddenly said.Little Qiao responded in acknowledgement and helped him onto his bed and covered him in blankets. Then she left the room.The door closed with a \u201cka-cha\u201d sound.Lu Sheng slowly rose from the bed and took out a grey paper packet from a drawer.He opened the paper packet gingerly to reveal some fine greyish-white powder.This were the remains left behind by the Demonic Ghost.Lu Sheng did not know whether it was of any worth. But any object left behind by such supernatural beings had to be of some use somehow.Hence, he did not dispose of the powder, but rather hid it carefully.He spread the powder out on the tabletop.\u2018Looks like if I want to find out what this stuff is good for, I\u2019ve got to look for the Yan Kai duo,\u2019 he mused.Keeping the powder, he finally climbed onto the bed and slept soundly.When he awoke, it was already dark.Little Qiao was lighting up the candles in the room. She was twelve years old this year. She was presently bent over, with her butt under a small white dress facing Lu Sheng. Its perkiness was a huge temptation.The hem of her skirt reached towards the knee. With her present bent-over position, the silhouette of her round, perky butt was clearly visible through her skirt.\u201cAhem\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng coughed lightly. Having awoken, he was feeling refreshed and alert.Little Qiao heard him immediately and quickly spun around.\u201cYoung Master, you\u2019re up! There\u2019s still some fungus soup boiled with vegetables in the kitchen. Would Young Master like a bowl?\u201d\u201cWhat time is it now?\u201d\u201cAlmost the Hai hour,\u201d Little Qiao hurriedly replied.Lu Sheng did the conversion in his mind. The Hai hour was between nine to eleven o\u2019clock at night.\u201cOh, it\u2019s already so late. Have the few who went out in the day sent any word back?\u201d\u201cYou mean the Taoists?\u201d Little Qiao clarified.\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cBrother Yuhan has been waiting outside for a long time. There should be some news,\u201d Little Qiao replied.\u201cLet Yuhan come in.\u201dLu Sheng rubbed his temples and began climbing out of bed to get dressed.By the time he was properly dressed in his clothes and outer robe, the muscular guard from before\u2014Yuhan\u2014had entered.\u201cYoung Master,\u201d he clasped his hands together in ceremony.\u201cIs there any news from Taoist Yan Kai?\u201d\u201cYes. Taoist Yan Kai went to the Zheng Family. One hour ago, he solved a similar missing person case for the Zheng Family. Now, he\u2019s gone to the old Xu Manor,\u201d at the mention of Yankai, a look of respect appeared on Yuhan\u2019s face.This man was able to resolve that strange matter so quickly!One needed to know that he had seen what that Demonic Ghost was like\u2014it could possess a body, it could fly, it was extremely fast and even carried extremely dense toxic Qi on its body. Even Young Master was hurt by it!Yet that Taoist could deal with such a monster so easily. He truly deserved the title of an expert!Lu Sheng was unsurprised. \u201cHow about Miss Zhuan Feng?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s already found some leads. I\u2019ve instructed a few men to follow Miss Zhuan Feng out of the city. There should be a message from them soon,\u201d Yuhan replied.\u201cThey truly are professionals indeed. When these matters land in their hands, clues start showing up in just one day!\u201d Lu Sheng exclaimed. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Grab a bite with me. Hopefully, my sister is fine.\u201dNeither Yuhan nor Little Qiao dared to reply to that. As servants, no matter how they replied to such comments, they were inviting trouble onto themselves.Lu Sheng led the two of them out of the bedroom, which was guarded by two guards. An entire table full of delicacies had already been prepared outside.A few servant-maids were cleaning the utensils efficiently.Lu Sheng sat down, grabbed some food with his chopsticks and put it into his mouth.\u201cNews! Young Master! There\u2019s news!\u201dSuddenly, a series of shouts rang forth from outside the courtyard.Lu Sheng rose at once. A fumbling houseman dashed into the courtyard through the entrance, panting while speaking loudly, \u201cSecond Miss\u2026 there\u2019s news of Second Miss! In the deserted Taoist temple outside the city!\u201dOutside Nine Links City, there were three Taoist temples. But only one was deserted.It was situated north of Nine Links City, near the White Frozen Ocean. There was a series of deserted mountains there and a Taoist temple was built in the mountains. No one knew which Lord of the Dao was worshipped there. Neither did anyone know when the temple was built.But Lu Sheng at least knew of that place. He had visited it several times when he went hiking as a boy.Whenever it rained, they would head to the deserted Taoist temple for shelter.\u201cIs it that Taoist temple near the White Frozen Ocean?\u201d Lu Sheng added to clarify.\u201cThat\u2019s the one indeed,\u201d the housemen quickly answered. \u201cMiss Zhuan Feng said that all the missing persons may be gathered in that Taoist Temple and that we can investigate it ourselves.\u201d\u201cWhat about Taoist Yan Kai?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ve already gone ahead!\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s eyes narrowed. He had only just recovered and should not be so quick to join in the action.But, this was a golden opportunity.Ideally, the best scenario was that Taoist Yan Kai would stay for the long term. But from the looks of it, the duo including Yan Kai didn\u2019t seem like they were planning to stay for long. Rather, it appeared more as if they were merely passing by this place in the pursuit of some lead.\u2018Looks like I really need to think hard about how I can get word out of this Taoist regarding the rumored secret arts that can handle and deal with ghosts.\u2019Lu Sheng\u2019s original intention was to acquire some of the cultivation mantras used by those rumored immortality cultivators.Since even things like Demonic Ghosts existed, perhaps those methods to cultivate immortality and become an immortal existed as well.\u201cGather over ten men. We\u2019ll go take a look too.\u201dAt this thought, Lu Sheng gave the orders.\u201cYes!\u201d Yuhan quickly acknowledged.***The night wind howled, bringing with it a piercing coldness.Among the mountains, a long line formed by red flaming torches was moving rapidly.The leader, riding on a horse and wrapped in a thick coat, was none other than Lu Sheng.Behind him was Yuhan, who was himself followed by over ten guards.The party had advanced in the dark for the duration of a joss stick before finding the road that led towards the deserted Taoist temple mentioned by Zhuan Feng.Equipped with torches and weapons like sabers, swords, bows and arrows, and wearing leather helmets, the party looked almost like real soldiers.Everyone advanced another few hundred steps in the cold wind. Finally, an old, desolate grey- and yellow-colored Taoist temple revealed itself in the forest ahead.The originally quiet and dark temple was now filled with sudden flashes of sparks. Faint yells and shouts came from it as well.The cold wind was too strong. Lu Sheng was straining his ears, but all he could hear was the howling of the wind which covered up the sounds coming from the deserted Taoist temple.When they were just a hundred steps away from the temple, he raised his hand, signaling the party to halt.Now that they were near, everyone could hear the shouts coming out from the Taoist temple. They should have come from Taoist Yan Kai.\u201cYoung Master, what should we do?\u201dYuhan asked a trifle nervously, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead.\u201cThere\u2019s no hurry,\u201d Lu Sheng tightened the fox fur outer coat around him. The fluffy white fox fur covered his neck tightly and looked very warm and snug. \u201cIf we go over now, we\u2019ll only become a burden to the Taoists. So, there\u2019s no hurry,\u201d Lu Sheng said gravely.Everyone waited for a while longer. The sparks and flashes in the temple were getting brighter and brighter, and Taoist Yan Kai\u2019s shouts were getting clearer and clearer.Lu Sheng waited outside quietly for a while, until the shouts from the temple ceased. Only then did he signal for a torch from a guard.Gripping the torch himself, he approached the temple alone.Yuhan wanted to stop him; but on a second thought, he gritted his teeth.\u201cFollow!\u201d He shouted loudly, following closely after Lu Sheng.As for the rest of the housemen and guards, their hair stood on its ends. But the iron rules of the Manor compelled them to advance forward, after Yuhan.Although Yan Kai as well as Young Master were shielding them in front, these housemen and guards were largely inexperienced youths who had not seen blood yet. It was already to their credit that they were able to suppress their instinct to flee.[1] ED/N: Edible Bird Nest, search that on wikipedia to find out what\u2019s that. To put it shortly, it\u2019s an actual bird nest that\u2019s made of solidified saliva of some bird; it apparently tastes great and has a big nutritional value, and is quite expensive. Here likely as a soup.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Through the collapsed gate, he could clearly see Yan Kai wield a tempered steel sword and strike a hazy white figure into retreat.Within the blink of an eye, the white figure was savagely stabbed by the sword and shrieked pathetically in a girlish voice.After that, it collapsed on the ground and immediately vanished into thin air.Red-faced, Yan Kai slowly sheathed his sword. White steam was rising slowly from his crown.With its close proximity to the northern frozen ocean and its location deep in the mountains, this place was freezing cold. Even exhaled breath condensed into white vapor, not to mention the heat from such an intense battle.Having sheathed his sword, Yan Kai saw Lu Sheng and his party.\u201cIt\u2019s the Lu Family\u2019s Young Master Sheng and his men.\u201dDuan Rongrong had previously been hiding in a corner. Seeing that the Demonic Ghost had been destroyed, she quietly snuck out of her hiding place.\u201cWhat a close shave. Demonic Ghosts have never lived in groups. To think that we ran into three of them here! Our luck was just too bad,\u201d at the thought of the situation earlier, her nerves remained jittery.\u201cIt\u2019s alright now. They\u2019ve all been dealt with,\u201d Yan Kai said in a composed manner. \u201cGo greet Young Master Sheng. The underground tunnel in the temple may have got something to do with the missing persons.\u201d\u201cMission completed! We\u2019ve earned a long journey\u2019s worth of travelling expenses!\u201d Duan Rongrong leapt in joy. Patting the dust off her clothes, she approached Lu Sheng and his party.Yan Kai shook his head as he followed after. Fatigue showed on his face.Lu Sheng plastered on a smile and approached in greeting.\u201cTaoist-sir\u2026\u201dThe words had only just escaped his lips when he heard a ripping sound like the tearing of cloth.\u201cPOOF!!!\u201dA white figure shot towards Lu Sheng and the guards behind him from the side!\u201cNot good! It\u2019s trying to possess a body!\u201dYan Kai knew how difficult it was to face Demonic Ghosts. Unlike other ghosts, Demonic Ghosts were capable of possessing bodies. Once a Demonic Ghost possessed a body, many of his special methods to counter them would lose their effect; he would be left with no choice but to face them head-on.Moreover, when a Demonic Ghost possessed a body, it would temporarily increase the possessed body\u2019s overall ability by a large margin. It was an insane power.Perhaps if he was at his peak, he would not fear it. But now that Lu Sheng had brought so many men, the Demonic Ghost was supplied with plenty of ideal targets to possess. These muscular men, full of vigor and energy, each made for perfect host for the Demonic Ghost.Presently, he was taxed to his limits and near the end of his strength. Once the Demonic Ghost successfully possessed a body, the situation would instantly turn extremely perilous.\u201cMOVE AWAY!!!\u201d Yan Kai rushed over, his blood and Qi surging like waves within him.Yet, as fast as he was, he was still no match for the Demonic Ghost\u2019s speed!With a \u201cswoosh\u201d, the white figure had already pounced towards Lu Sheng\u2014the one with the richest blood and Qi among them.Yan Kai was alarmed. It was one thing for others to be possessed, but if Lu Sheng met with any mishap, they would run into real trouble here in Nine Links City!Although they had interacted with each other for only a day, this short period of time had given them a deep impression of the status the Lu Family commanded in Nine Links City!Stepping forward using a strange movement pattern, he burst forward at high speed in an attempt to intercept the white figure before it pounced on Lu Sheng.\u201cCLANG!\u201dWithout warning, a white glint flashed.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes burst open.All around him, the flow of Qi trembled as deafening tiger roars could be heard.Lightning-quick, he pulled out the long saber strapped to his back with his right hand and hacked downwards at the area before him, pencil-straight.Gleams of light flashed off the saber as it roared madly like a fierce tiger.\u201cROAR!!!\u201d\u201cBOOM!!!\u201dThe saber hacked at the white shadow. Like a torn rag, it was forcibly flung outwards and tossed wildly about by the impact, before finally vanishing with a poof.Silence descended on the area. Slowly, Lu Sheng sheathed his saber.The muscles all over his body remained bulged due to the increased blood circulation, causing him to give off an air of savagery and menace, as if he was some ferocious beast.Yan Kai froze in his steps, his eyes opened wide. Staring at the spot where the Demonic Ghost had vanished and then looking at Lu Sheng\u2019s body, currently inflated with Qi and blood, he was struck dumb for a whole few seconds.Duang Rongrong\u2019s eyes lit up and she walked towards Yan Kai, clicking her tongue.\u201cBrother Yan Kai, this Young Master Sheng\u2026 is not to be trifled with\u2026\u201dDuan Rongrong was merely a novice in the arts who had yet to grasp the true implications of that saber stroke. But, Yan Kai was a different story. He stared dumbly at Lu Sheng and was still unable to speak even when Lu Sheng had walked up to him.\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard, Taoist-sir. If it hadn\u2019t been for the fact that the Demonic Ghost was already mortally wounded by Taoist-sir, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to finish it off in one saber stroke,\u201d Lu Sheng smiled. [1]\u201c\u2026Young Master Sheng\u2026 is too polite,\u201d Yan Kai finally shook himself out of his shocked daze.\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ve seen other exorcists like myself. I\u2019ve also seen people who could deal with troublesome stuff like Demonic Ghosts using other methods.But to slay Demonic Ghosts purely with the might of one\u2019s inner force, like Young Master just did\u2026 this is the first time I\u2019m seeing such a thing.\u201dAs he spoke, he began recalling his earlier words about how martial arts were useless against Demonic Ghosts.Now, he couldn\u2019t help but put on a pained smile.\u201cOh?\u201d Lu Sheng was surprised.Smiling bitterly, Yan Kai was now no longer impatient like previously and began explaining in detail.\u201cActually, martial arts aren\u2019t really entirely useless. But only inner Qi of an extreme Yang nature or some special attribute would cause some damage to ghosts.But the level of damage we\u2019re talking about\u2026 let\u2019s put it like this: if one unit of strength based on our method can kill one Demonic Ghost, then it\u2019d take fifty units of strength to do the same with Yang-nature inner Qi!\u201dLu Sheng instantly understood.It was now clear to him why the supposed martial arts experts did not enter Yan Kai\u2019s eyes. The gap between their efficacy was simply too big!\u201cBut\u2014on top of the fact that it was already wounded by me\u2014 that stroke which you performed earlier was capable of slaying the Demonic Ghost in one move because the inner Qi which you used possesses an attribute that was able to slightly suppress the Demonic Ghost,\u201d Yan Kai added.Those who had followed Lu Sheng\u2014Yuhan and the rest of the Manor guards\u2014had personally witnessed how Lu Sheng had hacked into the floating white figure in one saber move.Their previous fear vanished instantly, turning into boldness.Moreover, each one of them was now looking towards Lu Sheng with eyes full of respect and worship.While the Taoist was powerful indeed to destroy those ghastly white shadows so easily, they now felt that their own Young Master wasn\u2019t too shabby either.Yuhan had been fearful earlier, especially when the ghost had pounced towards them. His back was soaked in cold sweat.It was a good thing that he didn\u2019t manage to react in time; he just stood frozen and so did not make a fool of himself. However, more than half of the guards behind him had turned around and fled, their torches and weapons abandoned on the ground.Lu Sheng turned around and glanced at his guards before turning to Yuhan and saying, \u201cTidy up this place and search the perimeter. See if there\u2019re any others. Taoist-sir, this place is \u2018clean\u2019 now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He spun round to ask Yan Kai.Yan Kai blushed in embarrassment as he was reminded of his earlier negligence. He nodded vigorously.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s \u2018clean\u2019 now. That was just a fish that got through the hole in the net.\u201dDuan Rongrong was staring at Lu Sheng curiously with her big eyes. Meanwhile, Yan Kai continued, \u201cThere\u2019s an underground tunnel in there. When Miss Zhuan Feng discovered this place, she surmised that there might be living people hidden in it.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s Miss Zhuan Feng?\u201d The question had only just left Lu Sheng\u2019s mouth when Zhuan Feng walked out from the temple.\u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ll take a look inside.\u201dLu Sheng gripped his saber\u2019s hilt tightly and walked towards the temple\u2019s gates.Yan Kai and Duan Rongrong followed, taking Lu Sheng over in a few steps to lead him in.The entire Taoist temple was a yellowish grey, comprising of three rooms linked together.The Great Hall right in the middle was missing its doors. A gaping hole was also discernible in its ceiling, revealing the messy undergrowth and rocks within.Lu Sheng followed the Yan Kai duo into the Great Hall. On the wall facing the main doors was the drawing of a black and white Tai Chi diagram. [2]Before the Tai Chi diagram was a stone idol. However, half its head had been sliced off and now it was indistinguishable as to which Lord of the Dao it was that had been worshipped here.Yan Kai walked to the idol and hooked something up from among the undergrowth with his foot.\u201cKA-DUMP.\u201dWith a crisp sound, a square entrance, about the size of a person, was revealed on the ground, opening an underground passage.From the entrance, one could even hear the faint howl of the wind, mixed with crying sounds made by people. It was very eerie.Zhuan Feng walked to the side of the entrance and said,\u201cI\u2019ve gone inside this tunnel once just now. In it\u2026 there are some corpses, and also some living\u2026\u201dAt this point, an awkward expression appeared on her face, as if she lacked the words to describe what was inside.Lu Sheng glanced towards Yan Kai.But the Taoist merely smiled bitterly and shook his head.\u201cI\u2019ve heard Miss Zhuan Feng\u2019s description of this place too. Only you can go in. Don\u2019t worry, there are no longer any evil things inside. There is no danger.\u201dA bad premonition surfaced in Lu Sheng\u2019s mind. He gripped his saber\u2019s hilt tightly and suppressed the unease in his heart. Then, he slowly climbed down the steps into the tunnel.Zhuan Feng followed along as well.Apart from the two of them, no one else entered.The tunnel was rather narrow at first. After about ten steps or so, it came to a bend and led to a pitch-black iron door.The door was ajar and faint sounds could be heard from within.Lu Sheng glanced at Zhuan Feng.\u201cThat\u2019s the place. All the missing persons are here, I think.\u201dZhuan Feng said earnestly.Lu Sheng was rather curious about this Zhuan Feng.What on earth must she have gone through to turn from a girl in the prime of her life into such an indifferent person, like a professional hunter?For example, when the Demonic Ghost had appeared earlier, Zheng Feng didn\u2019t look panicked in the slightest when she came. Perhaps she had similar encounters in the past.Lu Sheng studied Zhuan Feng measuredly.\u201cMiss Zhuan Feng, have you got any interest in joining my Lu Family as a paid consultant?\u201d\u201cNope,\u201d came Zhuan Feng\u2019s unembellished reply.\u201cFine,\u201d Lu Sheng knew that, apart from money, he had nothing that could attract such a talent and hence said nothing else.He pushed open the iron door.As the iron door creaked against the ground, Lu Sheng gradually took in the view behind the door.It was a stone chamber no longer or wider than ten steps. A heap of naked corpses was piled up in one corner.Among them were both males and females, the young and the old.Apart from the corpses, there were also three living people left in the room.They were two women and a man\u2014all well-built and clearly the type who had trained regularly.Lu Sheng\u2019s heart sunk when he saw that one of the females was Lu Qingqing.Without a strip of clothing on her, Lu Qingqing was presently on her fours. Her long hair had fallen in a mess and her face was pale with a tinge of blue.Hearing commotion, she lifted her head and looked dazedly at the door. Her originally lively big eyes had become blank, lifeless and dull.Saliva dripped down the corner of her mouth. She seemed completely devoid of intelligence.\u201cQingqing!!!\u201d Lu Sheng rushed up, took off his outer coat and wrapped her in it. \u201cQingqing, wake up! Wake up!!\u201dHe gave Lu Qingqing two slaps on her face.But it was futile.Lu Qingqing\u2019s eyes remained the same as before.Witnessing the scene, a trace of sorrow flashed past Zhuan Feng\u2019s eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s no use. She\u2019s already lost her mind\u2026 Yin Qi invaded her brain and, without the support of Yang Qi, at least half of it died. It\u2019s already a miracle that she\u2019s alive. Those were the Taoist-sir\u2019s exact words.\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s heart sank violently.Lifting Lu Qingqing up in his arms, he looked at the other two people.Both the man and the woman were of fine appearance with attractive bodies. Clearly, they were deliberately spared and kept here by the Demonic Ghosts for god-knows-what purpose.[1] ED/N: The MC is speaking humbly here. Sorry, no fitting translation into English is possible, at least considering MC\u2019s status and the exact context.[2] ED/N: It\u2019s probably obvious, but it\u2019s the round, half-white and half-black symbol in which both colors look like two curving tears merging with each other, the symbol of Yin and Yang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0KurisuCarrying Lu Qingqing, Lu Sheng\u2019s thoughts were extremely complicated.Although this girl and he were siblings, honestly speaking, his feelings for her didn\u2019t run deep.Firstly, it was because Lu Qingqing had always been practicing martial arts outside the family. Secondly, he actually wasn\u2019t the original Lu Sheng.At such a time, however, as the elder brother he had to appear to be in sorrow regardless of his actual feelings.Lu Sheng carried Lu Qingqing and, along with Zhuan Feng, examined this small underground dungeon. Apart from the corpses and three dazed, mindless retards, there was nothing to be found there.The two of them led the three retards out of the dungeon and saw Yan Kai and Duan Rongrong waiting outside. Yan Kai was sitting cross-legged, his face red and a trace of blood hanging off the corner of his lips. On the ground was a small puddle of black blood he had just spat.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Just some congestion,\u201d Yan Kai said emotionlessly.\u201cMiss Lu Qingqing was damaged by Yin Qi. It\u2019s already a miracle that she survived.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201dLu Sheng opened his mouth, but did not say anything in the end.He felt that he was presently in a place filled with grave danger.That feeling had suddenly washed over him when he was carrying Lu Qingqing out.Wasn\u2019t he now playing the role of one of those minor characters in the background in those period horror stories?Presently the situation was that Nine Links City was infested with Demonic Ghosts, hiding and untraceable.His Lu Family could become collateral damage of their activities at any time.As an ordinary mortal, his only reliance was the Modifier and his martial arts.He severely lacked the means to deal with the supernatural, such as Demonic Ghosts.Just fighting a single Demonic Ghost alone had almost made him run on empty gas. If he had to face two of them at a time, he would really be in a tight spot.At this thought, the grief on Lu Sheng\u2019s face gradually turned into a troubled expression.\u201cMy sister has turned out like this, all thanks to Demonic Ghosts. Can Taoist-sir please advise if there are any means that can empower us mortals to be capable of fighting Demonic Ghosts? Or, are there maybe some places or people from whom we can seek help?\u201dOn one hand, he said these words to enquire about other methods. On the other hand, he was probing if there were other groups or communities that were capable of defeating Demonic Ghosts.\u201cThis\u2026 well, this humble Taoist\u2019s knowledge is limited. The average person can never be in the same league as ghosts, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Yan Kai deliberated, glancing at Lu Qingqing with eyes of pity. Then, he continued, \u201cAs for groups and communities that can help\u2026 we exorcists are one such. But, most of us are hard to track. My suggestion for Young Master Lu is to still keep on posting hiring notices. Perhaps you\u2019ll be in luck and secure the assistance of some exorcists.\u201dHaving heard his words, Lu Sheng thought for a moment and asked, \u201cDoes Taoist-sir take in disciples?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t he himself who wanted to become his disciple, however. His intention was to entrust some of the Lu Manor\u2019s kids under Yan Kai tutelage. That was, after all, a way to gain some power for self-preservation in this chaotic world and simultaneously establish some connections.Hearing about disciples, Yan Kai\u2019s face immediately turned awkward.\u201cTo be frank, Young Master, exorcists are mostly gifted from birth. This can\u2019t be cultivated. The mantra cultivated by this humble Taoist will harm rather than help mortals should they cultivate it. That\u2019s why, up till now, I\u2019ve also been looking for a person who can inherit my skills to take in as disciple. But, it\u2019s a pity\u2026\u201d\u201cGifted from birth?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s face looked crestfallen.\u201cThat\u2019s right. The main reason why this humble Taoist can suppress ghosts lies in my blood. Through the tempering by a particular skill, my blood gained some effects that can counter ghosts. This is also the only way to suppress them. In actual fact, many other exorcists rely on their own blood to do so as well,\u201d Yan Kai replied without any concealment.\u201cBlood\u2026\u201d Understanding finally dawned on Lu Sheng.Yan Kai had no reason to lie to him. Moreover, Duan Rongrong at the side too kept on nodding her head in agreement. \u2018Looks like exorcists really rely on their blood to counter ghosts.\u2019\u201cIs there really no other way?\u201d Lu Sheng heaved a long sigh.Yan Kai could not bear to see Lu Sheng\u2019s disappointment as well as the pitiful Lu Qingqing in his arms.\u201cOther ways\u2026 this humble Taoist really has nothing else to offer. Without the innate gift, there\u2019s simply no way\u2026Nonetheless, for so many mortals to exist in this world and even propagate to such a massive extent, there undoubtedly exist some forces that have been protecting everyone from the shadows, fending off the ghosts.We exorcists are one of them. If Young Master Lu is really interested, you can investigate thoroughly and perhaps find some clues.\u201dLu Sheng nodded.\u201cSigh\u2026 I guess that\u2019s all I can do. In that case, I wonder if Taoist-sir can sell me some items that can counter ghosts?\u201dYan Kai shook his head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m unwilling. It\u2019s just that items made out of my own blood can only be used by me. They\u2019ll be useless in others\u2019 hands. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t need to let Rongrong hide in a corner.\u201dLu Sheng believed that Yan Kai was telling the truth. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t so frankly come clean about the power of his blood. After all, wouldn\u2019t it be extremely dangerous if he ran into some evil men who would drug him, tie him up and drain him of his blood everyday like cattle?Sighing again, Lu Sheng carried Lu Qingqing closer to himself against his chest and then left the Taoist temple alongside Yan Kai and the rest. Then he climbed up his horse.\u201cIn that case, will Taoist-sir return along with us?\u201d\u201cNo need. I want to examine this place further. Perhaps I can find a lead on the original Demonic Ghost here. There\u2019re more than a few Demonic Ghosts in Nine Links City\u2014we\u2019ve got to find the \u201cpatient zero\u201d. Otherwise, as time passes, that original Demonic Ghost will grow stronger and stronger,\u201d Yan Kai declined.\u201cAlright, then. Should Taoist-sir have any needs, feel free to come to Lu Manor. I, Lu Sheng, will be sure to help with all I have! Additionally, all three of you must definitely come to Lu Manor to collect your compensation.\u201dHolding onto the reins with one hand, he turned the horse around and headed back on the path they had come from with the retards and guards in tow.\u201cOh right, Young Master Sheng! You\u2019ve just slayed a Demonic Ghost, so a lot of its scent remains on you. If there are other Demonic Ghosts nearby in the city, they\u2019ll certainly pick you as their target. And, very possibly, you may even draw out a Great Demonic Ghost, so please be careful. If you need any help, you can find someone to alert me at the first instant,\u201d Yan Kai suddenly shouted.Hearing these words, Lu Sheng\u2019s heart skipped a beat.\u201cMany thanks, Taoist-sir, many thanks, Miss Zhuan Feng.\u201dHe turned around and waved his arm towards the back.The party went back on horses along the path they had come to the temple.Though the mountain path was rocky and winding, the horses\u2019 speed made up for their otherwise slow progress. Yuhan followed right beside Lu Sheng, vigilant and ready.The other guards had not fully recovered from their shock. As a result, no sound apart from their breathing and the horses\u2019 trots was heard for a while.Lu Sheng\u2019s mind was occupied.\u2018Great Demonic Ghost! I can barely handle one Demonic Ghost. This Great Demonic Ghost\u2026 just by its name alone, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s even stronger than that one just now.\u2019His heart was once again heavy with pressure.He had thought he finally possessed some power for self-preservation. Who knew that Yan Kai would indicate otherwise? Now he realized that he still remained in an extremely precarious situation.\u2018The occurrences in Nine Links City have really been strange. Previously, the entire city\u2019s strength was activated to look for someone. Or something. And now, so many Demonic Ghosts have popped out. I\u2019d bet my head that there must be some connection between the two,\u2019 Lu Sheng pondered. \u2018The only way for me to raise my strength right now is to upgrade Black Fury Skill by one more level. I really can\u2019t think of any other way.\u2019His brows were locked tightly together in a furrow.In his arms, the retarded Lu Qingqing saw his furrowed brows and quietly reached out and caressed his brows, grinning dazedly.Lu Sheng pushed Lu Qingqing\u2019s hand down and continued along his train of thought.His situation was perilous indeed.Lu Family held a huge estate and businesses and had a hand in almost everything in the city. A tall tree attracts the wind. News of anything that happened in his house would immediately spread across the entire city like wildfire. [1]Including news of how the midnight wail had been solved.\u2018Since there is a realm of people who know about Demonic Ghosts, what\u2019s their purpose?The duo including Yan Kai came at such a perfect timing. We haven\u2019t put up the notice for more than a few days when they came in response\u2026 perhaps there\u2019s another faction playing its pieces from the shadows.\u2019He did believe Yan Kai\u2019s theory of blood and innate gift. That kind of power which could exorcize ghosts can only be wielded by those with a special bloodline. This was perhaps the prerequisite for stepping into that higher realm.Lu Sheng kept pondering it over in his heart as he rode back.Only after entering the city and returning to the Lu Manor did he finally clear his mind of his thoughts as he alighted from his horse.Yan Kai\u2019s words left him with a sense of frustration and helplessness.No innate gift.Without it, he was merely an ordinary mortal as Yan Kai described.Although, according to Yan Kai, it was already extremely impressive for him to attain this level as a mortal, Lu Sheng knew a disparity when he saw one.His innate gifts, or lack thereof, had determined that a natural insurmountable chasm existed between himself and those of that realm. In effect, it had also sentenced him to being handicapped on the day when he would face off against the supernatural.Alighting from the horse, Lu Sheng saw Second Mother following right behind his father Lu Quanan. At the sight of Lu Qingqing in his arms, relief flooded her face, as if a huge burden had been lifted off her shoulders.But gloom fell onto Lu Sheng\u2019s heart.\u201cServants, take Young Miss back to her room to bathe and rest.\u201dHe lifted his voice.A few fit servant-maids approached and took Lu Qingqing over from him.Lu Sheng gave a few more instructions, letting them bring the other two retards to bathe and settle them as well.Lu Quanan and Second Mother Liu Cuiyu both sensed something amiss. Not only did they see two unfamiliar retards, more importantly, Lu Qingqing\u2019s eyes were dazed. When she saw them, she actually didn\u2019t even say a word of greeting but yawned instead, as if she did not recognize them.\u201cLittle Sheng? This\u2026 this is\u2026?!?!\u201d Liu Cuiyu\u2019s face turned white as a sheet of paper and asked, her voice trembling.\u201cLet\u2019s talk inside.\u201dLu Sheng gestured with his hand, signaling the guards behind him to disperse and rest. As for those who had not been scared off earlier, Yuhan would make a count of them.The party entered the manor and Lu Sheng swiftly had men prepare the remuneration so that they could pay Yan Kai and the rest their silver notes anytime.He himself, however, led Lu Quanan and other family members into the Great Hall in the inner courtyard.After the servant-maids were dismissed, Lu Sheng sat down and recounted the entire process of how he had found Lu Qingqing, from beginning to end.Right after he ended, Liu Cuiyu\u2019s eyes flipped upwards and her body went limp, unconscious.\u201cSecond Mother!\u201d Lu Sheng rushed over to support her. Fifth Mother and the rest also hurriedly pressed her Ren Zhong acupoint. [2]\u201cQingqing\u2026\u201d Lu Qunan looked as if he had aged several years in the blink of an eye. He slumped onto his seat, unmoving. \u201cThere\u2019s really\u2026 no hope for a cure?\u201d He looked towards Lu Sheng, clinging onto the last glimmer of hope. \u201cWe can plead with Taoist Yan Kai. Perhaps he\u2026\u201dHis face dark, Lu Sheng shut his eyes and slowly shook his head.\u201cI\u2019ve already asked him\u2026\u201d He replied hoarsely.\u201cIn my opinion, Second Sis may be better off this way\u2026 lest she goes out every day and causes trouble\u2026\u201dFifth Mother\u2019s daughter Lu Yingying mumbled softly at the side.Though the rest may not have heard, Lu Sheng\u2019s five senses were incredibly sharp because of his martial arts training. He heard every word, clear as day.He lifted his head and glared sternly at Lu Yingying, who trembled in fear and no longer dared to make a sound.[1] ED/N: A tall tree attracts the wind, one of the common idioms in xianxia novels. It means that the more you stand out (especially because of your riches or your conduct), the more likely are others to target you.[2] TL/N: In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Ren Zhong acupoint, located right in the middle between the nose and upper lip, was pressed to help someone who had fainted regain consciousness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In this family, the only people whose safety he was concerned about were his old Dad Lu Quanan, Second Mother, and Little Qiao.As for each and every other person in the family, they were rather unfeeling towards one another. Lu Qingqing was done for, yet none of them had grieved too much. Even younger sister Lu Yingying could utter words such as this\u2014it just went to show how cold-blooded each of them was at their core.Although he and Lu Qingqing did not share a close relationship, when he thought of Second Mother\u2019s situation as well as what Yan Kai had said earlier, his originally hopeful outlook plunged to low depths. Disappointment crept into Lu Sheng\u2019s heart.He remained downcast. Only after some time did his mood recover.Although he was an ordinary mortal, he had the Modifier. Even if he could not cultivate the exorcists\u2019 methods, it didn\u2019t necessarily mean that he was weaker than them.He did not believe that relying on his own strength was insufficient to deal with the supernatural, be it demons, devils, ghosts or monsters.\u201cRegarding Qingqing\u2019s incident, we\u2019ll give it a rest for the moment. In the future, when we get the opportunity, we can find a physician to heal her. However, there is another matter that we cannot afford to put off now.I heard from Taoist Yan Kai that within Nine Links City there\u2019s still quite a number of ghosts hiding somewhere. We need to take adequate precautions,\u201d Lu Sheng said gravely.\u201cStill quite a number?\u201d Lu Quanan exclaimed. As for the rest, looks of shock appeared on their pale faces.Previously, it was impossible for them to defend against this type of ghosts by merely relying on their strength in numbers. And yet, there was still quite a number of such ghosts!?\u201cThis is RIDICULOUS!!!\u201d Fifth Mother suddenly stood up and shouted in a fit.\u201cSHUT UP!!!\u201d Lu Quanan slapped hard on the arm of the chair.Fifth Mother was scared out of her wits and shuddered, getting back into her seat.Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze swept across the family members. The expression of every single one of them became the color of frosted-over eggplants, their bodies listless. Fear and helplessness could be seen in their eyes.\u201cSo, my suggestion is, since it is still safe now, our Lu Family should leave Nine Links city immediately.\u201dLu Quanan shook his head.\u201cThat\u2019s not possible now. The higher-ups have given clear orders that none of the four big families are allowed to leave Nine Links City. Previously, I couldn\u2019t understand how this order came about. Now that I think of it\u2026\u201dLu Sheng felt a chill down his spine.\u2018Did the government officials intentionally coordinate this? Or was it just a coincidence?\u2019\u201cWhat if we left in small groups?\u201d Fourth Mother asked in a low voice. \u201cIsn\u2019t Big Brother around\u2026\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t do,\u201d Lu Quanan shook his head. \u201cEarlier, when I went to the city gates, Big Bro didn\u2019t come to see me. Instead, he sent a letter to inform me that even the Prefect was also not allowed to leave the city.\u201dThere was a deafening silence in the room. Everyone looked towards Lu Sheng.Earlier, it was Lu Sheng who had been able to help them tide over a desperate crisis and settled the matter of the female ghost\u2019s wails in the Manor.\u201cNow\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng lowered his head as he said grimly, \u201cWe can only stay within the Manor. Try to buy and stockpile more food items, some grain and meat to keep as our food reserves for the long term. We need to be sufficiently prepared that we\u2019ll be trapped for a long time.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Lu Quanan regained some of his spirit for the moment and nodded.\u201cBOOM!\u201dJust then, a huge tremor shook the ground and caused it to sway.Shockingly, a thundering sound of explosion rang out in the west part of the city!Lu Sheng quivered, jumped up and flew out of the Main Hall as he looked towards the sky in the West.There, scarlet-red flames soared high into the sky. Apparently, something had exploded and resulted in a raging fire.The bright-red flames lit up half the sky in Nine Links City!From the distance, countless sounds of wailing and shouting could be heard, interspersed with chaotic screams for rescue from the fire.\u201cI\u2019ll go take a look first!\u201dLu Sheng could not see the situation clearly from the inner yard, so he quickly explained to his Old Dad Lu Quanan before bolting off towards the main entrance of the Manor.He had just left the entrance when he got the servants to bring a horse over.Lu Sheng noticed that on the street in front of the Lu Manor\u2019s main entrance, quite a number of men, armed with swords and sabers, was rushing in the direction of the great fire.Each of these men moved deftly on their feet, as if they were all well-trained. Moreover, they looked towards the fierce fire not with looks of astonishment and fear, as Lu Sheng would have expected, but rather with a sliver of greed and anticipation.Although Lu Sheng barely stood at the entrance for over ten breaths of time, he had already seen three waves of these well-trained men running past the Lu Manor entrance.Some of them rode on horseback as they dashed ahead madly while others charged forward on foot. Both men and women were present, ranging from the young to the old.However, most of them were not from Nine Links City or its vicinity.From the looks of their dressing and appearance, they were more exquisitely and delicately made up than the locals, with many small trinkets and adornments on their bodies. One look was all it took to tell that they were from the Central Plains.He waited till the servant, who was just as unnerved, walked the horse over with much effort.Lu sheng patted the sturdy horse, which was thoroughly spooked and struggling madly, intending to flip himself up on it. Then, he gazed upon the group of well-trained men passing by on the street, and was shocked to see two familiar faces in the crowd.Duanmu Wan, along with the male guard who constantly shadowed her, were both riding in the direction of the fire on horseback.Duanmu Wan was dressed head-to-toe in black veil, with a conical wickerwork hat on her head. A bit of her lithe body remained barely visible through the gauze material of her clothing.As she passed by the Lu Manor, she likewise saw Lu Sheng and exclaimed in surprise with a slight \u2018eh\u2019.\u201cYou\u2019re not dead yet?\u201dShe suddenly blurted out those words as she nudged her horse to slightly lower its speed. She stared at Lu Sheng as if he were some exotic animal.\u201cWhat does Miss Duanmu mean by these words?\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s face darkened; he did not understand what she meant.\u201cInteresting.\u201d Duanmu Wan smiled a little. \u201cSeems like we are really quite fated. I\u2019ll come and find you after this.\u201dLu Sheng still had more questions, but Duanmu Wan urged her horse along and increased speed as she and the male guard sped towards the fire.Just as they left, that man likewise looked at Lu Sheng in astonishment.That look seemed as if\u2026As if he were looking at a man who was supposed to have been dead, but was shockingly still alive.Lu Sheng climbed onto the horse, intending to follow along.However, a voice called out to him at once. It was Yan Kai.\u201cYoung Master Sheng, it\u2019s best that you don\u2019t butt in. This matter has nothing to do with you.\u201dThe three of them, Yan Kai, Duan Rongrong and Zhuan Feng, were all rushing in the direction of the fire.Seeing that Lu Sheng also intended to follow along, Yan Kai could not help but offer a word of advice.\u201cWhat does Taoist-sir mean?\u201d Lu Sheng asked grimly.\u201cThis massive fire was deliberately started by a Great Demonic Ghost. The air of grievance there billows to the heavens; any ordinary mortal who nears it will lose his mind and endanger his life!\u201d Yan Kai said solemnly. \u201cEven if Young Master Sheng has extraordinary martial arts prowess, there is no other way this situation would play out.\u201d\u201cBut I saw quite a number of people rushing over there earlier\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng was doubtful.\u201cThose people are looking to die, none can save them. Besides, it seems someone has specifically lured them over,\u201d Yan Kai said indifferently.Lu Sheng fell silent.A serious incident had occurred near his house, yet he could only look on wide-eyed, without any idea of what had happened. This made him feel miserable.Seeing that Yan Kai had advised him out of good intentions, he clasped his hands together in salutation.\u201cMany thanks for Taoist-sir\u2019s reminder.\u201dYan Kai nodded hastily towards him. Then, with Duan Rongrong and Zhuan Feng, all three sped in the direction of the fire.Seeing this, Lu Sheng instantly understood that Duan Rongrong and Zhuan Feng perhaps also had certain special abilities, and were no ordinary mortals.Or rather, they had other intentions to begin with which had brought them specifically to Nine Links City\u2014this small insignificant city near the frozen northern ocean.Having understood that, he once again flipped himself off the horse and shouted towards Yan Kai.\u201cTaoist-sir, Miss Zhuan Feng, why not let me arrange a few horses for you to get there faster!\u201dYan Kai was startled, but soon realized that Lu Sheng was selling him a favor.Considering the many situations that could crop up as they made their way over, it was important for them to conserve their physical energy.He swiftly nodded.\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to trouble you!\u201dLu Sheng was just about to get his men to bring some horses over when he did a double take.\u201cNo, no need to bring any over. The stable is just right over here. Men! Bring Taoist-sir and the rest to the stable to pick their horses, they\u2019re free to choose any!\u201d Lu Sheng commanded loudly.\u201cYoung Master Sheng is a man of honor indeed!\u201dYan Kai cupped his fists and hastily followed the guard to the horse stable.Lu Sheng stood at the entrance of the Lu Manor with just a few guards who were oblivious to the situation by his side.He gazed in the direction of the blaze, his thoughts gloomy.The huge fire raged on for god-knows-how-long before it gradually subsided and was extinguished.Lu Sheng also stood at the Manor entrance for that same length of time.\u201cKa-Cha! \u201dA flash of blue lightning streaked past.The sky was enveloped in a picture of grey\u2014it was unclear whether it was the billowing smoke from the fire or dark clouds.Very soon, an endless sheet of rain descended from the sky, raining cats and dogs.Lu Quanan also came out and stood next to Lu Sheng. Some servants specially held out a canopy to shelter them from the rain.The torrential rain crashed onto the ground, causing a white, blurry layer of water vapor to form from the splashes.The sky gradually lit up; dawn would soon break. A whole night\u2019s effort had passed by unknowingly.Lu Sheng stood at the Main Entrance, seemingly lost in his thoughts.He had a premonition that, somehow, the huge explosion and the blast from the night was something incredibly important.And it had occurred right at the doorstep of his house.It was a pity that he was not powerful enough, and dared not even go near.He could tell that Yan Kai did not lie to him. What happened last night was really something out of ordinary mortals\u2019 league.\u201cThe fire should have been extinguished by now. I received news that it was the fireworks store in the West of the city. A large pile of fireworks exploded. The fire was simply too huge and killed many people\u2026\u201d Lu Quanan sighed.\u201cFireworks store\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng repeated the words and looked to the West of the city.The sky had slowly turned bright; the horizon was entirely a mix of blue and white.Lu Sheng tightened his grip on the saber on his waist and walked in the direction of the fire.\u201cDad, I\u2019ll go over to take a look.\u201d\u201cBe careful,\u201d Lu Quanan urgently cautioned. He didn\u2019t have inside information regarding the fire, but simply felt that Nine Links City had not been peaceful recently.\u201cI know!\u201dLu Sheng left the Manor and headed straight in the direction of the west part of the city.At the beginning, he wasn\u2019t able to see anything much until he got nearer and nearer to the site of the fire.The colors of the streets and houses gradually changed into a picture of greyish-black. There was quite a number of ordinary folk who lined the streets, holding onto their luggage, blankets and the like, without a home to return to.There were sounds of crying, chatting, and other noise and din that permeated the air. It was absolutely chaotic.Lu Sheng sped onward for another stretch of road.Soon, the people in the area grew fewer and fewer. Houses that lined both sides of the street were thoroughly charred. Some of the houses had collapsed into rubble from the fire; a gaping hole stood where the roofs used to be.From time to time, bits of charred bones and ashes could be seen on the ground. Skeletal remains such as these were scattered all over.The closer he went, the more alarmed Lu Sheng became.There was an innumerable amount of skeletal remains. Who knew how many people died in the explosion and fire last night?Very soon, Lu Sheng arrived at the epicenter of the explosion and fire.It wasn\u2019t some fireworks store, but rather another manor that belonged to the Prefect Song Duanchi\u2014the Pearl Manor.The entire Pearl Manor had collapsed, changed beyond recognition. Countless piles of ruins lay around in all sizes, looking like many oddly shaped tombs.Lu Sheng saw that he wasn\u2019t alone. There was also quite a number of individuals from the pugilistic world, armed with swords and sabers, who were loitering in the vicinity and seemed to be searching for something.All these pugilists kept a distance from each other, a look of vigilance in their eyes. They carried a somewhat imposing manner, and were clearly none of the local well-trained men from the Nine Links City.He also saw that these pugilists would, from time to time, dig up some miscellaneous rubbish items from within the rubble and swiftly gather them into their arms.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then why are you here? Shoo!\u201d The man looked as if he had seen a fool.Seeing that he was about to turn on his heel and leave, Lu Sheng retrieved yet another golden tael from his waist pouch, thrusting both pieces before him.The gold indeed caused the man to stop in his tracks. He surveyed it, then looked over Lu Sheng\u2019s appearance. Convinced that Lu Sheng wasn\u2019t there to vie with him over the items, he said, \u201cWhy\u2019re you here for the action when you\u2019ve got no idea what\u2019s going on?We\u2019re all here because we heard that yesterday night, there were many experts who performed exorcisms. However, in the middle of it, a rare treasure surfaced that caused a great commotion. An expert ran off with the treasure while others all gave chase. This whole place then collapsed into ruins.As for us, we\u2019re all here get a share of the pot, and pick up some valuables from the dead.\u201d\u201cValuables from the dead?\u201d Lu Sheng understood now. These people were especially here to loot any precious treasures still remaining on the corpses.He wasn\u2019t sure what had happened last night. However, for it to attract such a great number of powerful men, it must have been no small matter.\u2018All these people seem to have some insider information. For example, the likes of Duanmu Wan and Yan Kai all came to Nine Links City for some unknown reason. Perhaps they are people who belong to the same realm as Demonic Ghosts,\u2019 Lu Sheng deliberated on the matter in his mind. He let the man go then went round the vicinity a few times and saw that there were black lumps scattered here and there, resembling molten steel.He didn\u2019t stay long. Soon, he hurried back towards Lu Manor.When he had returned to the Lu Manor, just as he was entering the main doors, a servant boy came forth to notify him.\u201cYoung Master, Miss Duanmu is here again. She\u2019s waiting for you at the Guest Hall right now,\u201d the servant boy whispered.\u2018Duanmu Wan is here again?\u2019 Lu Sheng shuddered inwardly, thinking back to what Duanmu Wan had said the last time he saw her. His spirits were jolted for a moment as he strode towards the Guest Hall.Upon entering, Lu Sheng at once saw Duanmu Wan with her signature dress and physique. In this era, it was very hard to find women who dared to dress like Duanmu Wan, even in the brothels.She sat on a wooden chair as she lightly sipped on tea from a white porcelain teacup in her hands, her conical hat lying by her side. Her shawl cloak was undone, revealing the tight-fitting black athletic robes underneath.Except that, the athletic robes were so tight-fitting that they entirely outlined each and every curve on her body, similar to a second layer of skin. Especially at her chest and hip areas, it seemed as if she didn\u2019t even have any clothes on, looking no different than if she were naked. This caused the surrounding servant maids\u2019 and boys\u2019 faces to turn bright red as they could not help but dare not look straight at her.\u201cMiss Duanmu, it\u2019s been a long while. I wonder, what did you mean by your previous words?\u201d Lu Sheng did not beat around the bush when he saw her. He waved his hand to dismiss the other people in the area while his own bright eyes stared at Duanmu Wan piercingly, not averting his gaze in the slightest despite the other party\u2019s provocative costume.Duanmu Wan smiled lightly. She raised her head and sized up Lu Sheng quizzically, smiling as she said, \u201cYoung Master Sheng, you\u2019ve been well since we last met. To be able to survive this great calamity is really a cause for celebration. You don\u2019t need to worry, it\u2019s really much safer now.\u201d\u201cWhat does Miss mean?\u201d Lu Sheng narrowed his eyes. Clearly, Duanmu Wan had quite a bit of insider information.\u201cNo other meaning,\u201d Duanmu Wan put down the teacup, clapped lightly and stood up.By standing up, every inch of her flawless body was on full display before Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes. Her bosom swayed to and fro, and even the silhouette of its peaks as well as the mysterious part between both her legs were clearly visible.Yet, Duanmu Wan didn\u2019t care in the least, and smiled as she said, \u201cSince the others have all left, and Young Master did not die in the previous tragedy, then you\u2019ve earned the rights to know some insider information after all.\u201d\u201cWill Miss please enlighten me,\u201d Lu Sheng asked with rapt attention\u2014he only worried that the other party wouldn\u2019t elaborate.Duanmu Wan supported one of the \u2018weapons\u2019 on her chest with one hand. Smiling, she added, \u201cSince Young Master Sheng did not die, I guess you have already tasted the prowess of Demonic Ghosts. Those things, full of filth and deviousness, are by no means easy to handle. Without some special methods, it\u2019s not possible to survive their deathly chase.\u201d\u201cDemonic Ghosts\u2026 Miss, are you able to give me more details\u2014where are these Demonic Ghosts from, and what are they after?\u201d Lu Sheng asked grimly.\u201cDon\u2019t rush it\u2026\u201d Duanmu Wan laughed lightly, unhurriedly coming around Lu Sheng\u2019s side and extending a hand out to lightly caress his cheek.Her movements were exceptionally soft and gentle, just like the light brushing of thin gauze. If one did not pay attention to it, there would be no way to notice. It was slightly ticklish and slightly limp, similar to the teasing between lovers.\u201cMiss Duanmu, you were just talking about the insider information,\u201d Lu Sheng took a small step backwards, avoiding her touch. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything to hide, you very well could have not come here of your own volition to find me. I think, Miss, you also have your own agenda, don\u2019t you?\u201dDuanmu Wan immediately broke into delicate, flirtatious giggles.\u201cPlop!\u201dShe forced her body against Lu Sheng, her entire upper body pressed snugly against his. The curves of her chest squeezed tightly against Lu Sheng, producing a beautiful shape and ravine.\u201cYoung Master Sheng is indeed extraordinary. When I first laid eyes on you, I already quite liked you.At that time, just to give it a try, I placed some stakes on you. Who would have known that Young Master would actually survive! This really is a pleasant surprise\u2026 did you know, since knowing that you were alive, this maiden\u2019s heart has been pining for you, even in the thick of battle between life and death?\u201d Duanmu Wan\u2019s words were thick with emotion, her voice seemingly able to melt the defenses of the hardest of men.Lu Sheng suppressed the fury in his heart and allowed her to press herself against him as she wished. He remained his composure as he asked, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me Miss has fallen for me?\u201d\u201cWho knows?\u201d A smile still on her lips, Duanmu Wan took a step back, gleefully twirling around. The \u2018weapons\u2019 in front of her body trembled and bounced constantly from their great weight.\u201cI really like you, Young Master! Whenever I look at you, I think of my dearest beloved from before\u2026 a pity that he died early, and all my admiration has turned to nothing,\u201d speaking of this, a hint of loneliness and self-pity flashed in Duanmu Wan\u2019s almond-shaped eyes.Lu Sheng was certain that he did not see wrongly\u2014it was a sense of self-pity, the special kind of emotion that those of poor self-esteem wallowed in. It actually appeared before his eyes on this mysterious Duanmu Wan\u2026 clearly, the individual she referred to was definitely not a man of simple background and standing.\u201cSo now, Miss Duanmu, can you share what exactly Demonic Ghosts are? And what sort of people are you?\u201dDuanmu Wan smiled as she casually went around to Lu Sheng\u2019s back, pressing her entire body against it.\u201cWhen I see you, Young Master, I can\u2019t help but imagine that it\u2019s him. Ai\u2026\u201d she heaved a long sigh that told of her deep grief.\u201cDo you know, Young Master, why human beings are still able to lead relatively peaceful lives in this day and age when demons and devils run amok and ghosts and monsters proliferate? Just like how you, Young Master, have lived an ordinary life for the first ten over years of your life.\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cThere\u2019s someone protecting us?\u201d\u201cYup\u2026 I guess you can consider that \u2018protection\u2019\u2026 this is a harsh and difficult world; there needs to be some hope and consolation for mankind after all,\u201d Duanmu Wan shook her head lightly, inclining her head to sniff the back of Lu Sheng\u2019s neck.\u201cThis world\u2026 you can say it belongs to two factions.\u201d\u201cWhich two factions?\u201d\u201cDemons and Noble Families,\u201d Duanmu Wan simply raised two fingers. \u201cBy demons, I mean basically creatures such as the Demonic Ghosts, which Young Master has already made contact with. As for Noble Families, they comprise of people like me and Yan Kai\u2014exorcists born with innate power.\u201d\u201cBorn with innate power? Aren\u2019t they acquired after birth through cultivation?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s heart tightened, clinging onto some last ray of wishful hope.\u201cNope\u2026\u201d Duanmu Wan laughed coyly. \u201cI understand Young Master\u2019s yearning, but it\u2019s a pity that no cultivation method exists in this world at all that can deal with demons and devils. Neither do we Noble Families need any methods or supposed skills.All that we practice and train in are methods of developing and mobilizing the unique power that we\u2019re innately gifted with from birth, as well as how to use this power against demons and devils. As for mortals, they can only ever remain mortals\u2026\u201dLu Sheng fell into silence.This was the truth he didn\u2019t want to hear the most.Duanmu Wan continued, \u201cWhen it comes to the realm that governs and lords over this world, we\u2019re talking only about two factions\u2014one being demons and the other being Noble Families. Our power is innate and far beyond the reach of mortals. The chasm between us and mortals is simply unsurpassable\u2026 we\u2019re gifted with power from birth; even the weakest among us is absolutely and unimaginably powerful by mortal standards.\u201d\u201cI refuse to believe that mortals don\u2019t stand even an ounce of chance,\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head slowly.\u201cYoung Master\u2019s really too cute\u2026\u201d Duanmu Wan giggled, \u201cYou need to understand that, in this world, there\u2019s no such thing as \u2018Spirit Qi\u2019 or \u2018Immortal Qi\u2019 like in those novels. There\u2019s nothing at all in the air that we live in. All that we can rely on is ourselves.The inner Qi that martial arts experts cultivate come from the food that we eat. But the power and strength innate to us Noblemen come from deep within our bloodlines. The gap between them exists from the point of birth\u2026\u201dShe gently released Lu Sheng, walked to his side, and started caressing his muscular chest with her slender hand.\u201cPreviously, two forces were fighting over a treasure in Nine Links City. One of them was the powerful faction that commands the Demonic Ghosts and chose the Xu Family and your Lu Manor as sacrifices.\u201d\u201cMay I ask, Miss, what\u2019s the name of this faction?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s spirits lifted as he registered this critical news, and asked after digesting the information from earlier.\u201cMortal-Sweeping Manor,\u201d Duanmu Wan rested her head on Lu Sheng\u2019s arm. \u201cTheir name is Mortal-Sweeping Manor. It\u2019s an old faction that\u2019s been based here for a long, long time.They\u2019re in control of many ghosts. It was them who selected Young Master\u2019s Lu Family\u2019s head as their sacrificial target. With such a priceless treasure emerging, a great amount of sacrifices is needed. A great, great amount\u2026\u201d\u201cIn that case, since my Dad\u2019s not dead, will they return for us?\u201d Lu Sheng replied with a question.\u201cHeeheehee\u2026 if they come for you, then Young Master can come to Wan\u2019er\u2026 if you make Wan\u2019er happy, maybe I can even save Young Master once~~\u201d Duanmu Wan suddenly giggled teasingly.\u201cMiss Duanmu\u2019s making fun of me,\u201d Lu Sheng wrested himself free from her caress and turned to face her squarely. \u201cMay I know if Miss still possesses other inner force mantras that aren\u2019t life-force skills?\u201dHe did not know how much of what Duanmu Wan had said was true. But regardless of their authenticity, as long as he managed to obtain a new and stronger inner force skill from her, then this meeting would have been worth its while.\u201cInner force mantras? That stuff\u2026 what\u2019re they good for?\u201d Duanmu Wan straightened her luscious hair and puffed out her chest in front of Lu Sheng. \u201cWhat\u2019s fun about inner force skills? How about Young Master get into a room with Wan\u2019er and let\u2019s play some interesting games\u2026\u201d\u201cMiss Duanmu is joking again. What price must I pay to acquire those inner force skills? Please advise, Miss,\u201d Lu Sheng said somberly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019m not short of money anyway. It\u2019s just that even Wan\u2019er doesn\u2019t have the kind of item Young Master seeks. That kind of skill isn\u2019t even as useful as a life-force skill. To us, extending our longevity is much more useful than cultivating these stuff with pathetically low damage.But\u2026 Wan\u2019er does have a good idea.\u201d\u201cWhat idea?\u201d\u201cIf Young Master would really like to learn, we Noble Families also have great sects and gangs organized by mortals under our command. This kind of inner force mantra can be found in one them. Young Master can choose to join one based on your preferences. Wan\u2019er can even recommend you one, how about that?\u201d Duanmu Wan proposed gently.\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary. If you would, it\u2019d be great if Miss Wan\u2019er can give me some information about the sects and gangs in the region,\u201d Lu Sheng requested boldly. Although he had no idea why Duanmu Wan regarded him so highly, he wouldn\u2019t trouble someone else for this favor if he could help it. Since he had already owed her a favor regarding inner force mantras, he might as well trouble her further.\u201cLet Wan\u2019er have somebody send that over after I get back,\u201d Duanmu Wan smiled. With dazed eyes, she lifted her hand and was about to reach inside Lu Sheng\u2019s robes.\u201cMiss Wan\u2019er, please respect yourself!\u201d Anger arose in Lu Sheng\u2019s heart. He did not want to develop any relations with a woman of unknown background. Not to mention that this woman was taking him as a replacement for someone else. What if this woman suddenly went crazy one day and lost interest in him? Then he\u2019d be left in a pitiful state.\u201cJust call me Wan\u2019er\u2026\u201d Duanmu Wan\u2019s sensuous eyes lit with passion, her cheeks blushed and body hot. She seemed to be truly consumed with desire.She reached towards Lu Sheng\u2019s waist.\u201cMiss Wan\u2019er,\u201d Lu Sheng grabbed on to her hand. \u201cIf you\u2019re taking me as a replacement for someone else, then not only are you lying to yourself, you\u2019re also disrespecting your own body.\u201d\u201cDisrespecting?\u201d Startled, Duanmu Wan looked down and fell into silence.After a long while\u2026She suddenly heaved a long sigh.\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026 Wan\u2019er wasn\u2019t like this in the past\u2026\u201d she turned disinterested in a flash.Lu Sheng took two steps back without a word and merely stared at her.\u201cIn this region, the largest sect is the Crimson Whale Sect. The skills in that sect are pretty interesting. If Young Master is interested, you can check it out. But that sect is really too small. If Wan\u2019er has the opportunity to do so in the future, I\u2019ll take Young Master to a different place\u2014the Central Plains. The sects in that place are way stronger than the Crimson Whale Sect.\u201d\u201cMany thanks to Miss Wan\u2019er. I\u2019ll look out for any news about it. As for the future, let\u2019s leave it till then,\u201d Lu Sheng made a mental note and clasped his hands together.\u201cStill calling me Miss? Haven\u2019t you already touched my body?\u201d Duanmu Wan lamented as she looked at him.Stunned, Lu Sheng was about to speak when he suddenly noticed Little Qiao peering in from afar outside the window. The window had not been shut properly and Little Qiao was presently staring at them through it, wide-eyed and dumbstruck.It so happened that he and Duanmu Wan were in an extremely intimate position, with her hand on his waist and arm in his hand. The two of them were glued together and looked extremely intimate.\u201cAlright, I shan\u2019t tease you anymore. I\u2019ve got things to attend to, so I\u2019ll leave first,\u201d Duanmu Wan stepped backwards lightly and her smile faded.\u201cYoung Master\u2026 be honest, do you think that Wan\u2019er is a very bad and promiscuous woman?\u201d She looked at Lu Sheng with a look of inexplicable hope and anticipation, as if wishing for him to give a different answer.Lu Sheng was caught in a fix.She had helped him twice and given him so much useful information without cost. There was no way he could bring himself to tell her that she was a promiscuous, bad woman.He had always had a soft spot for those who showed him favor. Whoever was good towards him, he would be good to them. Yet right now, he was really caught in a dilemma.Lu Sheng deliberated over his words, carefully examining the Duanmu Wan before him.Presently, despite her sexy clothing, Duanmu Wan seemed to be hiding a faint trace of gentleness and purity. She seemed like a well-behaved girl-next-door, asking him timidly what was wrong with herself.\u201cI guess Miss Wan\u2019er is alright. Everyone\u2019s got his or her own way of dealing with the world. You\u2019re just slightly more open-minded than others,\u201d Lu Sheng said in full sincerity. After all, in his previous life, there were plenty of people on Earth who were much more liberal than Duanmu Wan. Some of them even put themselves out there on the internet stark naked for countless millions to view. Hence, in his eyes, Duanmu Wan was merely slightly more independent and unique than others.When Duanmu Wan asked her question, she was staring at Lu Sheng very seriously.To her surprise, Lu Sheng\u2019s words felt sincere, as if they had come from his heart rather than being a mere consolation. Such an attitude of acceptance was drastically different from what she had seen on many others whom she has asked the same question.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dA complicated expression flashed across Duanmu Wan\u2019s eyes. Subtly, some unexplainable waves were surging in her heart.\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know what Young Master wants so many inner force mantras for, I\u2019ve still got two books here. I\u2019ll just give them to you,\u201d she looked down so that he could not see her face. Rapidly, she took out two booklets and placed them on the table.\u201cWan\u2019er\u2019s got to go,\u201d she was already hurrying out of the house as her voice faded.Lu Sheng only just registered what had happened and hurried out in chase only to see the courtyard totally empty. In the blink of an eye, Duanmu Wan had vanished.Stunned, he stood in the yard for a while before collecting his thoughts.He returned to the Guest Hall and picked up the two booklets placed on the tabletop. On them were written: \u201cYin Yang Attraction\u201d and \u201cGreen Pine One-Thought Formula\u201d.They were precisely the two manuals that he had not chosen when he had bought an inner force manual from her the first time. Looks like Duanmu Wan truly had only these three inner force skills on her. At that time, she had offered them perhaps merely for kicks or because of some other complicated intentions.***Outside Nine Links City.Duanmu Wan\u2019s figure floated and landed lightly by Lake Sui Yang.The surface of Lake Sui Yang was as calm as a mirror. It looked just like a mirror, framed in white.Around the lake were huge swathes of white forests. Fine snow covered leaves and branches, clothing the trees in dress of silver and turning them into ice sculptures all around.\u201cTo think that there\u2019d be a time when the famous Autumn Princess Duanmu Wan, who has three thousand royal consorts, would dress up like a little girl. That\u2019s truly worth my showing up for this meeting,\u201d an insidious-sounding, deep male voice reverberated around the area.Duanmu Wan tightened the black shawl around her as her face turned cold. \u201cZhang Xinyuan. Have you come all the way here to the northern lands just to make a joke? Shall I help you gouge your eyes out? Let\u2019s see if you\u2019re still able laugh at that time.\u201d\u201cHeheh, don\u2019t be angry, Princess. Zhen Family and Mortal-Sweeping Manor are locked in war. Autumn Princess, you know Ye Lingmo. I\u2019ve come to ask you, Princess, to help make introductions,\u201d the voice continued. No sight of any person was to be seen from left to right; there was no way to pinpoint his exact location.\u201cMake introductions? Have you prepared my compensation?\u201d In a flash, Duanmu Wan\u2019s face had turned into an expression of gentleness and sensuality.\u201cI\u2019ve long since heard of your rule, Princess. Of course I have your compensation prepared,\u201d the voice continued.Duanmu Wan chuckled, her eyes spinning. \u201cHow about you consider spending a night with this Princess? Who knows? When I\u2019m satisfied, maybe I won\u2019t charge you?\u201d\u201cForget it. The reputation of the Autumn Princess has long entered my ears. This old man still wishes to live for a few more years,\u201d the voice chuckled dryly. \u201cHowever, if Princess reveals the whereabouts of that treasure and whose hands it now lies in, I can double the reward!\u201d\u201cScarlet Dragon Tribulation still remains in Taoist Crazed Heart\u2019s hands\u2014no one has managed to lay his hands on it. A few days ago, Mortal-Sweeping Manor engaged Zhen Family in a massive battle, triggering Scarlet Dragon Tribulation\u2019s sacrifice and causing a huge explosion. All three factions suffered significant losses. If you and those with you want to intercept it, this is the best and last opportunity.That\u2019s because too many have died, and Scarlet Dragon Tribulation is just about to complete its sacrifice\u2026\u201d Duanmu Wan swiftly added.\u201cIs that so\u2026.\u201d the voice turned somber. \u201cThank you, Princess, for your information. The recompense will be handed directly to your family guard. I\u2019ll take my leave now,\u201d the voice faded into the distance rapidly until it thoroughly vanished from above Lake Sui Yang.Duanmu Wan\u2019s smile gradually faded as well. She stared at the peaceful lake surface, her thoughts unknown to all but herself.***What happened in Nine Links City had moved Lu Sheng deeply.After Duanmu Wan left and he had his lunch, he returned to his room to begin cultivating inner force. He had even left the kitchen instructions to boil great amounts of tonic gels and send them into his room so that he could consume them any time.After this period of rest, he intended to cultivate both life-force skills he had just acquired.Based on Jade Crane Skill\u2019s example, Lu Sheng could tell that life-force skills could replace mental energy and Qi for consumption when he upgraded other skills.This stuff was like a reserve battery. During ordinary times, he was storing reserves. When it was time to use it, it would be of immense use.Lu Sheng shut his room\u2019s door and sat cross-legged on his bed.He gently flipped the Green Pine One-Thought Formula booklet open. Lines upon lines of handwritten words appeared, elegant and refined, seemingly the work of a woman.Only one line was on the first page of the booklet: \u201cAs human beings, we are to imitate the green pine\u2014unyielding in the wind, unceasing in the frost, undying in the most lifeless of lands.\u201dLu Sheng continued to browse. The second page was a diagram just like the one he had seen previously in Jade Crane Skill\u2019s booklet.It was an old, dark green pine, growing horizontally out of a cliff with its roots entangled in it. Its needles and branches were thick and dense, emanating an extremely vigorous and thriving life-force.This life-force skill emphasized only one concept, \u201cstillness\u201d. Stillness of Qi, stillness of mind. The body circulated breath based on the most instinctive cycle, producing strands of the purest life-force inner Qi.Because of Lu Sheng\u2019s foundations in Jade Crane Skill, he was quick on the uptake for this kind of life-force skill. Soon, he had already familiarized himself with it and began to meditate. This was not to say he was just sitting there quietly, but rather guiding his breath with particular postures and particular breathing techniques at particular times.After practicing for a period of time according to the skill manual, Lu Sheng rose and consumed a piece of tonic gel, and was about to go back to cultivating. This time, he was intending to cultivate Black Fury Skill, using Deep Blue to upgrade it to its highest level.\u201cThump, thump, thump.\u201dKnocks rang out on the door.\u201cYoung Master, Taoist Yan Kai and the rest are here,\u201d Little Qiao\u2019s timid voice sounded from outside the door.Opening his eyes, Lu Sheng quickly got out of bed and put on his outer coat and shoes.\u201cI\u2019ll be there right away.\u201dHe left his room and headed straight for the Guest Hall. Yan Kai, Duan Rongrong and Zhuan Feng\u2014all three of them were present.\u201cYoung Master Sheng, how have you been? You seem in a good condition,\u201d Yan Kai clasped his hands together and said in a casual tone.\u201cWill the three of you please be seated,\u201d Lu Sheng smiled.After the servant-maids served tea, they left and shut the doors and windows.Only then did he continue, \u201cTaoist-sir, what on earth happened last night?\u201d Lu Sheng enquired again.Yan Kai hid nothing and described in detail all that Duanmu Wan, too, had previously said. By the time he was done, an hour had passed.His description was even more detailed than Duanmu Wan\u2019s. Perhaps out of guilt for ruining several of Lu Sheng\u2019s horses, Yan Kai answered Lu Sheng\u2019s questions very seriously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had no idea how much of what he heard he could trust.After deliberating for a while, he asked, \u201cIn other words, has this incident ended just like that? Will Nine Links City be safe from now on?There won\u2019t be any more Demonic Ghosts? No more accidents, no more people dying for no apparent reason?\u201dYan Kai did not understand the meaning behind Lu Sheng\u2019s questions. But thinking for a moment, he replied earnestly, \u201cThat seems to be so. The treasure has been taken far away from Nine Links City. This humble Taoist also needs to follow after it to see if I can be of any use. As for the deaths\u2026 without the interference of external forces, I believe Nine Links City will return to its original state.\u201dTo his side, Duan Rongrong could not help butting in, \u201cThat thing\u2019s now already on its way to the Central Plains. Everybody is in hot pursuit, who would want to stay in this small city?\u201dYan Kai tugged at Duan Rongrong to shut her up before clasping his hands together towards Lu Sheng.\u201cYoung Master Sheng, seeing as we didn\u2019t really manage to help much during this trip, we won\u2019t take the money. If we\u2019re destined, we\u2019ll meet again in the future.\u201d\u201cHow can that be? Will Taoist-sir make me a man going back on his words?\u201d Lu Sheng pulled a long face and said seriously.With a gesture of his hand, he commanded, \u201cMen, bring out the silver notes!\u201dImmediately, some servant-maids on standby outside swiftly carried in an intricately designed wooden chest.Receiving the chest, Lu Sheng placed it on the table before them and opened it. A thick stack of silver notes lay inside.\u201cThis is the remuneration for the three of you. Although no accidents happened this time round, Taoist-sir and Miss Zhuan Feng\u2019s presence did enable my Lu Family to recover our missing persons. Just that alone is credit enough to receive this sum of money,\u201d Lu Sheng declared sincerely.\u201cThen we won\u2019t stand on ceremony!\u201d Before Yan Kai could decline, Duan Rongrong quickly reached out to grab the silver notes and stuff them into her pocket. \u201cWe\u2019ll pass Sis Zhuan Feng her share outside in a while!\u201dAn expression of helplessness appeared on Zhuan Feng\u2019s face. Clearly, the three of them had gotten familiar with one another.Seeing the situation, Yan Kai could only clasp his hands together with a helpless smile.\u201cIf Young Master Sheng really intends to discover methods to deal with ghosts, you can head to the Central Plans,\u201d he added after some hesitation. \u201cBut do permit a reminder from this humble Taoist. Young Master Sheng killed a Demonic Ghost previously. Its scent remains on you and could possibly lead to trouble. Should the Mortal-Sweeping Manor notice Young Master, they may dispatch Demonic Ghosts to come after you. Young Master can take the fresh blood of a virgin male goat and apply it all over your body. That way, the Demonic Ghosts may take you for someone already dead and leave you alone. This method works only on ordinary Demonic Ghosts, though.\u201dLu Sheng clasped his hands together and exclaimed, \u201cThank you for your advice, Taoist-sir!\u201d\u201cNot at all, not at all. In that case, I\u2019ll take my leave,\u201d Yan Kai rose to return Lu Sheng\u2019s salutation.\u201cTake care, Taoist-sir!\u201d Lu Sheng made no attempt to make him stay.The trio turned around and exited the Guest Hall, heading outside Lu Manor with Yan Kai taking the lead.Standing behind and gazing at the backs of the trio, Lu Sheng felt inexplicably crestfallen. It was as if a certain world that he had wished to make contact with was presently falling out of his grasp.Even after the trio including Yan Kai had left for an hour, he remained rooted in the Guest Hall, unmoving.\u201cYoung Master?\u201d Little Qiao walked in and called him timidly. \u201cIt\u2019s meal time.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d Lu Sheng was woken from his daydream and raised his head to look at the skies outside.Tidying his robes, he headed towards the Dining Hall with Little Qiao.The Dining Hall was already packed.Lu Quanan was seated on the main seat. The one seated beside him happened to be Uncle Zhao who was previously away. Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze swept across the hall and saw that the few martial arts experts who had left together with Uncle Zhao were now back as well.\u201cYour Eldest Uncle sent a message. The lockdown on Nine Links City has been called off and entry and exit are now fully permitted,\u201d Lu Quanan said softly. This good news did not bring him much joy, however. In an empty space on the side, Lu Qingqing was currently seated and fed by Second Mother Liu Cuiyu by the mouthful, like an obedient child. Every now and then, saliva would drip from the corner of her mouth. She was completely devoid of any semblance of a normal person.The rest of them largely had no mood to eat. After all, who among them had not seen the ruckus and chaos earlier, with that huge explosion and throngs of armed pugilists passing by the manor?Right now, all of them were a bundle of nerves.\u201cThe food\u2019s getting cold. Let\u2019s eat, let\u2019s eat,\u201d seeing that none had the mood to eat, Lu Quanan first picked up his chopsticks. \u201cUncle Zhao\u2019s back too. Our family\u2019s safe. All of us\u2026\u201d the words got choked in his throat as grief overwhelmed his heart. Helpless, he sighed.Seeing the scene, Uncle Zhao too was filled with helplessness and guilt. He had been receiving so many years\u2019 worth of salary from the Lu Family. Yet, at the critical moment, he was absent. Although he had been officially deployed away by the yamen, he and the rest ended up being dispatched to the mountains near the northern frozen ocean. They had swept the mountain and returned without encountering anything\u2014not a single incident had happened.What on earth was going on?\u201cSince the lockdown has been called off, this means that everything\u2019s ended,\u201d Lu Sheng said. \u201cDespite its abruptness, this ending means that we\u2019ve got to carry on with our lives. From now on, let the guards remain vigilant and do more patrols. That\u2019ll do.\u201d\u201cBrother Sheng is right on point. Let\u2019s hurry and eat, the food won\u2019t be tasty when it gets cold\u2026\u201d Lu Yingying assented softly on her seat.\u201cWhat Brother Sheng, Brother Sheng? You must call him Big Brother! Eat, eat, eat\u2026 that\u2019s all you know!\u201d Fifth Mother was about to slap her, but recalling that she was at the dining table, she restrained herself.Lu Yingying\u2019s head shrank into her shoulders and she no longer dared to make a sound.Only then did the family begin to eat silently.After the meal, none of them had anything to say to each other. Lu Sheng went back to continue cultivating inner Qi.Seated on his bed, he rested for an hour before finally attaining peak condition of his Qi and blood.\u2018Deep Blue!\u2019 He called out in his mind.The Modifier screen immediately floated into existence before him.Lu Sheng looked at the top row in detail and saw that the Black Fury Skill row on the Modifier already read \u201cLevel Two\u201d. He just needed to upgrade it by one level to attain the highest level there was\u2014Level Three.Based on what he had read in the skill manual, that was the highest level he could attain. Despite there being two more levels after that, forming a total of five levels, Lu Sheng had seen those two levels and felt that they were not perfectly integrated with the preceding section. Very likely, someone else had added them in afterwards. That kind of skill was not authentic and he did not dare to cultivate them.Presently, he was staring at the status display of Black Fury Skill on Deep Blue. Composing himself, he clicked on the \u201cModify\u201d button at the bottom of the screen. Instantly, the entire Modifier flashed once.\u2018Upgrade Black Fury Skill by one level!\u2019 Lu Sheng called out in his mind.\u201cSwoosh.\u201dAs the sound faded, he saw the Black Fury Skill status display blurring. When it came into focus again, it was already saying \u201cLevel Three\u201d.\u2018So, this is Level Three?\u2019 Lu Sheng waited for a while but his body didn\u2019t seem to be experiencing any changes.He began carefully examining the Black Fury Qi in his body. Then, he discovered that it was gradually growing thicker and thicker.If it was akin to a black fog before the upgrade, it was now turning into drops of black liquid.\u2018Doesn\u2019t seem to have consumed much of my energy,\u2019 Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes opened in puzzlement. \u2018Is it because I\u2019m now-\u2019\u201cPUUU!\u201dViolently, he spat out a mouthful of fresh red blood, dyeing his chest red. A raw, bloody stench instantly permeated the entire room.Lu Sheng felt his whole body on fire. He broke out into a helpless smile.\u2018And here I was thinking that there really wasn\u2019t any reaction this time. Who would have thought\u2026\u2019He shook his head and began carefully sensing the changes taking place inside his body.Upgrading Black Fury Skill to Level Three confined Lu Sheng at home for an entire month. Only then was he barely able to move about as before. During this period, Jade Crane Skill played a vital role, accelerating Lu Sheng\u2019s recovery.From that day onwards, there were indeed no more supernatural incidents occurring in Nine Links City. After Yan Kai and company departed, Nine Links City was restored to its former buzz and banality. All that had happened felt like a distant dream.That is, all except for the retarded Lu Qing Qing.Taking advantage of the present peace, Lu Quanan again brought up with Lu Sheng his intention to send him to Mountain Edge City.\u201cI\u2019ve made the arrangements. Over in Mountain Edge City, there\u2019s a house owned by our Lu Family. You can go over and live in it first. Coincidentally, the Annual Examinations are about to begin. Little Sheng, since you\u2019re passionate about martial arts, you should try to earn a martial degree. That\u2019ll help greatly when you seek an official appointment in the future,\u201d Lu Quanan advised.\u201cMartial degree\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, an academic degree would be even better. But even if you don\u2019t want to do anything over there, that\u2019s fine too. It\u2019s up to you. Our Lu Family owns a shop over there. You can manage it. All its earnings will go to you for your personal expenditure,\u201d Lu Quanan had clearly made every arrangement conceivable.\u201cNine Links City is too small after all. I\u2019ve registered you for enrollment in the Eastern Mountain Institution. Whether you try for an academic or martial degree when you\u2019re there, it\u2019s all up to you,\u201d Lu Quanan sighed involuntarily after he concluded. All that had happened in Nine Links City had disillusioned him. Regardless of how wealthy he was, when push came to shove, he could only count on his own family.\u201cEastern Mountain Institution\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng could roughly guess at his Old Dad\u2019s intentions. This way of sending your children to seek studies was really just a form of sending your kids abroad for further education. Only wealthy families had the means to do so.\u201cZheng Xiangui and his sister are going too. From our family, it\u2019ll be you and Yingying. Yiyi and Chenxin will go to another institution together,\u201d Lu Quanan continued.Lu Sheng thought for a moment and then nodded in agreement.Nine Links City was indeed getting too cramped for him. In fact, it was so limited that he couldn\u2019t even find any stronger skills and was consigned to third-grade saber techniques like Black Tiger Saber Technique. Mountain Edge City, however, was a different story, as there were stronger pugilists residing there. Moreover, if the Crimson Whale Sect truly was the strongest sect in the region, they would undoubtedly have a base in Mountain Edge City.\u201cWhen do I leave then?\u201d He asked.Lu Quanan thought for a moment and replied, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll let you decide on your own when to leave. I\u2019ll have your Eldest Uncle send someone to escort you.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll take a look around the city first,\u201d Lu Sheng sighed.He had more than a few teachers in the city who had taught him martial arts. Now that he was about to leave, it was only proper for him to visit them and bid them goodbye out of respect.Lu Quanan nodded, giving his permission, and left the rest up to Lu Sheng.Early in the morning on the second day, Lu Sheng dragged his body, which had not yet fully recovered from upgrading his inner Qi, out of the manor and rode around Nine Links City on a horse.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0KurisuAll over the city, there were women, children and the elderly who were weeping uncontrollably. White cloth was hung in many places. The poor families who could not afford to buy the correct type of white silk randomly tore a strip of white material to hang as a sign of mourning.Numerous potholes appeared on the street\u2019s surface. It was unclear what object had smashed into the ground to cause their appearance.Lu Sheng looked at the entire scene. After experiencing this battle, half of Nine Links City had been destroyed.After he surveyed the city, he paid a visit to each of the teachers under whom he had trained. Thankfully, these teachers were vigilant folk, well able to protect themselves, and thus did not meet with tragedy. After he had visited them, he sent a generous amount of silver notes to each of them. Then, he continued on his way to the Zheng Family.\u201cPAH!\u201dZheng Xiangui struck his hands together hard.\u201cBrother Sheng, let me go with you! Yu\u2019er and I will follow your family\u2019s entourage and make our way together, how about that? Dammit, this is the kind of armed escort enjoyed only by prefecture-level officials!\u201dLu Sheng was speechless. He looked around at the blackened and dirtied Zheng Family house; clearly, they had been through a lot of trouble, too.\u201cJust you and Yu\u2019er?\u201d He asked casually.\u201cYep, just like your family, we split into several groups, the rest will go to other cities. My old man was able to tell that this time round, this Nine Links City is really a land fraught with troubles. Even if all goes well in the future, if something like that occurs again, we won\u2019t be so lucky so as to be able to escape unscathed. If this time round we didn\u2019t have Brother Sheng to introduce Taoist Huanyang-Zi to us, then we, the Zheng Family, would also have suffered heavy losses.\u201dHe paused for a moment and sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s just a pity that younger sis Qingqing\u2026\u201dLu Sheng didn\u2019t reply. After a moment\u2019s silence, he said, \u201cHearing what you\u2019re saying, nothing happened at your house?\u201dZheng Xiangui was surprised at the question. Glancing shiftily to the left and right, he lowered his voice and whispered, \u201cMy Big Bro is gone\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright\u2026 this is really good news for you,\u201d Lu Sheng was struck dumb. \u201cWell, since you want to come along with me, I intend to leave tomorrow morning. After this, hurry and make the preparations, and also inform Yu\u2019er.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Zheng Xiangui nodded. Actually, after what happened at Nine Links City this time round, both of them understood deep in their hearts that their families had plans to relocate. If it had been another, greater city, those pugilists would not have dared to storm the place. As for the big fire, it would also not have taken place that brazenly.As he left the Zheng Family, Lu Sheng instructed Little Qiao to pack his belongings. The Eastern Mountain Institution where he was going to further his studies was an exceptionally renowned institution within Mountain-Edge City and the neighboring cities. The school rules were strict and none of the students were allowed to bring along their servant-maids and girls. Thus, for this trip, Little Qiao could only temporarily remain in Nine Links City.After hastily making the preparations, Lu Quanan stuffed ten thousand tael of gold notes in Lu Sheng\u2019s hands. Then, he let Lu Sheng and the escort guards who had been prepared to be on their way out of the city.However, as Lu Sheng was leaving, he faintly overheard that Prefect Song Duanchi of Nine Links City seemed to have suddenly fallen gravely ill a few days back. He had been unable to recover and was currently taking his last breaths.Thinking of the huge explosion at the Pearl Manor, Lu Sheng could guess that he had most likely suffered in this incident.Actually, this Prefect Song was also a pitiable man\u2026The entourage left early in the morning, when the sky was barely lit.Lu Sheng stood in the middle of the group, his face pale. A thick white fox fur coat hung across his body, looking as if the fur of an entire white fox wrapped snugly his whole person. It was the picture of warmth and luxury. Just this fox fur coat alone cost more than a thousand taels of silver.He silently gazed upon Nine Links City behind him\u2013he would perhaps never return to this place. His Old Dad Lu Quanan had plainly told him before he left that he wanted the whole family to relocate to a big city.\u201cBrother Sheng, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Zheng Xiangui was standing to the side, with the red-faced Zheng Yu\u2019er in tow.\u201cNothing, just some thoughts\u2026 cough, cough\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng was starting to cough again. He had trained vigorously in the Black Fury Skill this time round and hurt the Yang energy of his lungs. Moreover, he had consumed too much cooling medication that nourished his Yin energy, and thus was unable to bear it.\u201cYou should return to the horse carriage, Brother Sheng. We\u2019re about to begin our journey,\u201d the guard in charge of the official escorts, Old Cow, came over and said.Lu Sheng nodded. Taking one last look at Nine Links City, he turned around and was the first to board one of the horse carriages.\u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go! Everyone, LET\u2019S GO!\u201d Zheng Xiangui promptly shouted; he had long since grown impatient of waiting.***Mountain-Edge City. FebruaryIn the height of Spring, the huge forest outside Nine Links City was awash with a burning cloud-like red. Numerous little red flowers withered as they bore fruit, and each then again blossomed as they grew, painting the ground and the trees the color of red.Next to a river in the southern part of the city, a few neatly and smartly dressed scholars from the institution currently sat in a white octagonal pavilion.Every one of these scholars wore grayish-white long coats, their long hair tied up with a black scarf. In each of their hands could be seen a folding fan of the same make and model.\u201cBrother Lu? Brother Lu???\u201dA somewhat enthusiastic voice pulled Lu Sheng out of his daze.He turned around, sweeping his gaze back across the sprawling scenery on the vast plains before him, then looked around at the others beside him in the pavilion.The one who had called out to him was Song Zhenguo, who had traveled from the Northern cities to pursue his studies like him. This guy\u2019s family was famous and affluent, and he had been a master in eating, drinking and being merry since he was small. At the same time, his appearance was rather charming and attractive, and he would often gather with other like-minded people to go on outings.Song Zhenguo was introduced to Lu Sheng by Zheng Xiangui, and was from the same hometown as most of the others who were seated there. As most of these scholars from the institution came from the eastern cities, they naturally huddled together for this excursion.\u201cBrother Song, forgive me, forgive me. My mind wandered off for a moment,\u201d Lu Sheng said smilingly.It had already been half a year since sending Yan Kai and co away.In this half a year, he had made his way to Mountain-Edge City from Nine Links City, and even stayed there for a couple of months, all without seeing anything out of the ordinary happening.Security at Mountain-Edge City was excellent, with the Winged Honor Guard making their rounds within the radius of over ten miles in shifts throughout the day. It was sufficiently safe for one to leave their doors unlocked at night. As compared to Nine Links City, the difference was really like that of heaven and earth.There were no disasters here, nor were there any demonic ghosts. Even murder cases here were few and far between. Both within and outside of the city ordinary folk on the streets was almost completely clothed, much unlike Nine Links City where many poverty-stricken people were in patched-up clothing.He hadn\u2019t been here for long before he, together with Zheng Xiangui and his sister, found the Eastern Mountain Institution where they handled the school entrance formalities. It had been three months since they been admitted into the school.In these three months, it was with much difficulty that Lu Sheng was barely able to make up for the injuries he suffered from upgrading the Black Fury Skill and fully recover.Coming back to his senses, Lu Sheng looked at the others inside the pavilion.These scholars from the institution were currently playing a game somewhat similar to Feast on the River.First fill up a wine cup to the brim, then let a servant release it into a part of the stream by the pavilion as all the scholars wait inside as the wine cup gently flows downstream. Whomever the wine cup comes to a rest in front of, that person will have to down the entire cup of wine and answer a personal question that everyone had agreed upon in advance.Other than Song Zhenguo, there were five or six other scholars within the pavilion, all children of merchants. Besides them, there were also two women dressed in white and blue skirts\u2013they sat by the side as they watched the rest play. From time to time, they covered their mouths and giggled when the conversations got interesting.One of the two women was also from the same hometown as the others, and was quite beautiful.The other was a young maiden who had cherry lips and looked like the pretty daughter of a humble family. Her name was Chen Yunxi, and she was native to Mountain-Edge City.Chen Yunxi\u2019s appearance could be considered pleasant; although she did not have a beautiful face like many of the other maidens in the institution, her skin was fair, her figure remarkable and her long legs and slender waist particularly eye-catching.Attributes such as these could only be considered average to the people in this world. Yet from Lu Sheng\u2019s perspective, Chen Yunxi was the epitome of beauty. Especially her endlessly long legs were delightfully proportionate, giving her a perfectly exceptional silhouette.A pity that\u2026 people here didn\u2019t like long legs but rather preferred the more petite and dainty type who did not have legs that were too long.Therefore, the women like Chen Yunxi whom Lu Sheng viewed as a great beauty were seen by the people here to be average or below-average in terms of looks.Thinking of that, Lu Sheng noticed that Chen Yunxi\u2019s gaze had once again unwittingly fallen onto himself. Inwardly, he could not help but chuckle bitterly.He had but casually chitchatted with her for a couple of times, and even that was under the urging of Song Zhenguo. Who knew that as they chatted, he and this girl surprisingly hit it off like kindred spirits, with endless topics of conversation. Thus, they soon became good friends, albeit of a different gender. Sadly, good things don\u2019t last forever, and he was unaware how it came to be that Chen Yunxi gradually began to look at him differently, with a hint of something fishy in her eyes.Chen Yunxi\u2019s gaze constantly fell upon Lu Sheng. Anyone would be able to see the brilliant sparks within her eyes.\u201cAhh, Brother Lu, Yunxi\u2019s eyes are really set on you,\u201d one of the scholars by the side teased.\u201cA beautiful woman has looked upon you with favor. Everyone, don\u2019t you think we should punish him with a cup of wine?\u201d Another made fun of him.\u201cMiss Yunxi is beautiful both inside and out, and comes from a wealthy family. Her father is a tycoon in Mountain-Edge City, and even in the ten over neighboring cities! Brother Lu, if you don\u2019t make the most of this chance, you may just miss this golden opportunity!\u201d Song Zhenguo lightly whispered in Lu Sheng\u2019s ear.Lu Sheng shook his head. Under everyone\u2019s jesting, he retrieved a wine cup from the stream and drained it in one gulp.After drinking, he flashed the bottom of the cup for all to see.He conducted himself confidently and with ease. His appearance was not lacking in any way and was different from the rest of the scholars\u2019 because of his robust and proportionate frame. Because he was highly skilled in martial arts, cultivating both inner and outer force, there was even a mysterious glow within his eyes. One look would leave others with a lasting impression.So even though he was from one of those border cities, Nine Links City, and his family background could not compare to the vast wealth of many of those seated there, his elegance and spirit was actually the most eye-catching amongst them.Under the cajoling of those present as well as Song Zhenguo who added fuel to the fire, Lu Sheng was very soon arranged to sit together with Chen Yunxi. Most of the women of this world were very open-minded. As long as they didn\u2019t reveal too much like Duanmu Wan, people would not look at them any differently.Chen Yunxi had just sat there for a short while chatting softly with a close female friend before the crowd promptly egged her on and \u2018chased\u2019 her and Lu Sheng outside of the pavilion.The two of them took a slow stroll on the nearby lawn and had some space alone.It was morning. The sounds of birds chirping and the fragrance of flowers filled the air. Spring flowers on the rolling hills and vast plains painted the mountain ridges a magnificent cloud of red.\u201cThey\u2026 always like to fool around,\u201d Chen Yunxi\u2019s pair of big eyes looked at Lu Sheng, without trying to conceal herself in the least. It was already not the first time that they had been \u2018chased\u2019 out in such a manner.Both of them strolled on the crisp green lawn and crossed over a low hill. They were now out of sight of the rest, whose furtive glances visited them from time to time.Lu Sheng looked at Chen Yunxi next to him. She was wearing a long, uniformly white dress that covered only her thighs, revealing her knees. A pair of long shoes concealed her calves that would have otherwise been exposed by the dress. She had a lithe waist, full bosom, slender legs and long hair that fell to her waist\u2026 at one glance, it caused Lu Sheng to call to mind terms such as flawless, fair, and pure.\u201cThey have good intentions,\u201d Lu Sheng smiled. He wasn\u2019t one to put on false pretenses, nor was he puritanical. A beautiful woman was taking the initiative to pursue him and he himself was unmarried. He was not feeling conflicted; rather, he intended to simply go with the flow.Particularly, it was apparent that the best part about the woman before him was her pair of lengthy legs. Yet, in others\u2019 eyes, that was instead seen as her worst part. Thinking of that, he felt that it was a bit of a pity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Isn\u2019t it warm?\u201d Lu Sheng asked casually. \u201cActually, your legs are the most attractive part of your body.\u201dStartled, Chen Yunxi bowed her head, her face flushed.\u201cYou don\u2019t like long shoes\u2026? Then from now on, I\u2019ll reveal more of my legs\u2026 just for your eyes only\u2026\u201dLu Sheng was merely making a causal remark. Never did he imagine that\u2026The atmosphere between the two of them had turned rather strange. Neither of them spoke as they walked slowly on the lawn.Lu Sheng fell into a momentary daze.It had been half a year.In that half of the year in which he was in recovery, he had not encountered the supernatural again. Neither did he hear any news of Duanmu Wan or Yan Kai. It was as if all that had happened to him was merely an illusion and everything had now been restored to the usual peace and banality.If not for the vigorous inner Qi cycling endlessly within his body, if not for his ability to summon the Deep Blue Modifier at his beck and call\u2026 perhaps he would really think that he was living in a peaceful world without any supernatural entities.\u201cBrother Lu\u2026\u201d Chen Yunxi called his name softly all of a sudden, interrupting Lu Sheng\u2019s reverie.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Lu Sheng paused in his steps.Chen Yunxi looked down, her cheeks boiling hot as she whispered, \u201cMy Dad\u2026 would like to invite you to my place as guest and have a meal together.\u201dLu Sheng was stunned. Was he going to meet the parents now? But he and Chen Yunxi weren\u2019t even a couple yet. Wasn\u2019t it a tad too soon?\u201cBrother Lu\u2019s unwilling?\u201d Sensing Lu Sheng\u2019s hesitation, a shred of disappointment crept onto Chen Yunxi\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s just a casual meal\u2026 Daddy\u2026 just wants to see what kind of person you are.\u201dLu Sheng was speechless. He liked Chen Yunxi, but they were not at that stage yet. Moreover, things were developing too fast for his liking and he wasn\u2019t sure what to do now.After a moment\u2019s silence, he said, \u201cThis student would also like to see what kind of person the wealthy and renowned Old Master Chen is.\u201dUpon hearing that, Chen Yunxi\u2019s face broke out into a smile. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll be disappointed, then. My Dad\u2019s just an old man who likes to pull a long face. But in private, he\u2019s actually very childish!\u201dLu Sheng laughed along. But in fact, he felt surreal. Or rather, he felt out of place.The next step, if the other party\u2019s family was in agreement, was for him to bring Chen Yunxi to see his own father and Second Mother. Then, after the two families decided on the engagement, they\u2019d prepare the betrothal gifts, pick an auspicious date and then get married.Of course, that was if everything went smoothly. But, honestly, he wasn\u2019t intending to get married so early.\u201cThe Annual Examinations are almost upon us. If you\u2019re chosen, which institution would Brother Lu like to attend? This affects the future direction of our official appointment and how high we can go.I\u2019ve hired some experts to solve the last year\u2019s test question. There\u2019re five different ways of answering it. If Brother Lu needs them, let Yunxi send someone to deliver them to you, is that alright?\u201d Chen Yunxi asked softly. \u201cIt can\u2019t go wrong to do more practice questions and try to guess at the Examiner\u2019s intentions for this year.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 in that case, many thanks to Yunxi,\u201d Lu Sheng deliberated and eventually accepted her help. But his heart was actually confused.If all things went smoothly, he would attempt the Governmental Examination; after that was the Scholar Examination and finally the Imperial Examination. If he could pass all these examinations, he would eventually obtain a formal appointment. And he wouldn\u2019t just be a minor official\u2026 flying high and far was to be expected.But\u2026So what?He suddenly recalled the things that Duanmu Wan had mentioned to him. If they were real, then what was the point in becoming a court official?\u201cAs long as we pass the Annual Examinations, we would be recognized as degree-holders in the city and considered scholars. We would be exempted from taxes and even if we were idle for the rest of our lives, we would still live comfortably off the land. This is the dream of many\u2013I\u2019m sure Brother Lu is already fully confident,\u201d Chen Yunxi said softly.\u201cPerhaps\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng smiled and no longer said a word.No one knew about his other identity. No one knew that he was a powerful expert well-versed in both inner and outer force, and could fight Demonic Ghosts with the strength of his saber technique. Even Strength Proficiency pugilists wouldn\u2019t last for more than ten moves before him.The present him was growing stronger and stronger with each passing day as his Black Fury Qi increased day and night.Black Fury Skill and Jade Crane Skill. With the two combined together, they complemented and supported each other. One tempered his physical body while the other healed it and helped it recover, forming a perfect cycle.In the eyes of Chen Yunxi and Song Zhenguo right now, however, he was but a young master who had come from a wealthy family in Nine Links City. In contrast with others who had come from the countryside, Lu Sheng didn\u2019t have the down-to-earth aura they had. He carried a more refined and learned air than others. But, that was all.\u2018But, in this kind of living environment, what point is there even if I\u2019m decked in an official\u2019s robes? If the Demonic Ghost faction\u2013Mortal-Sweeping Manor\u2013comes in pursuit, I\u2019d still be helpless. I can only rely on myself\u2026 in these circumstances, am I still going to earn a martial degree like Old Dad asked me to?\u2019 He felt very out of place with the people around him.From a distance, he could hear laughter and revelry from the pavilion, giving him a strange sense of isolation.\u201cBrother Lu, I heard that the dried plums on West Village Street are rather tasty. There\u2019re also a number of dried fruits stores there. How about we go explore it together tomorrow night?\u201d Chen Yunxi suggested in a gentle voice. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s a big festival\u2013Dancing Dragon Festival; it\u2019s always been very lively in the past few years.\u201d\u201cSure\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng had nothing to do while waiting for news anyway\u2013he had sent men to collect information about Crimson Whale Sect. Then, he spent a large sum of money to purchase many expensive herbs. The bit of money he had was now almost spent.Without money, his training and physical nourishment had slowed down and he needed to find a way of generating more income as soon as possible.He continued strolling with Chen Yunxi for a while longer. This girl went on and on about the interesting things that she had encountered in school as well as their classmates. She seemed to be in high spirits.After accompanying her for a few more steps, the two of them began walking back. Everyone had drunk a little too much in the pavilion and so they started to take their leave and return home.Having bidden Chen Yunxi and Song Zhenguo goodbye, Lu Sheng slowly headed back.As he crossed the moat, a few mountain-folks carrying baskets on their backs were chatting as they entered the city.\u201cThe ban on Cypress Pine Lake is about to lift, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about time. I have my fishing nets ready at home. Once the fishing ban ends, I\u2019ll go pull up a good yield,\u201d an old farmer laughed.\u201cIf there\u2019s no high tide, this year\u2019s yield should be good. After all, the ban period has been so long.\u201d\u201cTrue that.\u201dThe mountain-folks swayed into the city, their backs full of mountain produce and vegetables.Listening in on the side, Lu Sheng smiled too.\u201cThis place is so much more peaceful than Nine Links City\u2026\u201d he exclaimed.Lu Sheng returned to his living quarters soon. Presently, he was living in a small house near the city gate. The two-story building had a winery on its first floor. The apartment on the second floor was his Lu Family\u2019s property, comprising three units, merged together as one.For convenience\u2019s sake, Lu Sheng did not make meals at home. Rather, he had ordered his meals from a restaurant beside the winery and would eat there every day at fixed times.After his meal, he returned to rest. Instead of cultivating inner Qi, he simply consumed some blood-supplementing medicinal paste and turned in early.Early morning the next day, he hailed a horse carriage and went straight for West Village Street.Seated in the horse carriage, Lu Sheng was still feeling tired. Thinking that his body\u2019s nourishment was insufficient, he reached for the waist-pouch he carried with him everywhere.He reached inside the waist-pouch, retrieved a red pill and was about to swallow it when he felt that something was odd.He thoroughly examined his own body from top to toe. Suddenly, he reached into his sleeve and found a faint-yellow note inside.The note had been furled and discreetly stuck to the inside of his sleeve. He felt it only when he had reached backwards for his waist-pouch.\u201cEh?\u201dLu Sheng took out the note and slowly unfurled it.A clear and tidy line of words was written on it.\u2018Please don\u2019t worry, Young Master. In an attempt to control a terrifying ghost, Mortal-Sweeping Manor has met with a great calamity and the entire faction was destroyed. They have no time to spare on their small grudge with Young Master. Wan.\u2019 [1]Expressionless, Lu Sheng rolled the note again and kept it in his waist pouch.\u2018So it turns out that Duanmu Wan\u2019s been keeping tabs on me\u2026Mortal-Sweeping Manor has always been the greatest foe for me to be worried about. A powerful faction in command of Demonic Ghosts\u2026 based on my present strength, there\u2019s absolutely no way I could resist them. To think that they\u2019d be destroyed just like that\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng again keenly felt that this was an extremely dangerous world he was living in.Having kept the note, he waited for a while longer before the horse carriage gradually came to a halt. It had arrived at Yang-Seeking Tower, where he had arranged to meet with Song Zhenguo and Chen Yunxi. [2]Lu Sheng alighted and saw that the entrance to Yang-Seeking Tower was flooded with a large throng of people, some going in and some coming out.Twelve stories tall, the red Yang-Seeking Tower was shaped like a stupa. Presently, every floor under the tenth floor was packed like a can of sardines with spectators, who had come to watch the dragon dance. [3]Opportunistic hawkers were hawking their goods, their yells incessantly echoing everywhere around them.Lu Sheng pushed his way through the throng into the tower and climbed up to the tenth story. Gradually, the crowd around him thinned and he no longer had to elbow his way through.\u201cIs this Young Master Lu?\u201d He had barely stepped onto the tenth story when a servant-lady came to verify his identity.\u201cOver here! Over here Brother Lu!\u201d Song Zhenguo and the rest were waving in his direction.Chen Yunxi was among them too. She put on a long, slim-fit green dress, which showed off her svelte figure perfectly.A head of long hair flowed down gently, tied up in a green lace at the end.Lu Sheng was all smiles as he approached them.\u201cThanks to all of you for getting me to such an awesome height!\u201dSong Zhenguo waved his hands rapidly, \u201cOh, you\u2019re the one doing us a favor! Yunxi pulled some strings and specially arranged this banquet for you, oh great Young Master Lu.\u201d\u201cYes, yes! If not for Miss Yunxi, the highest we could go would probably be the ninth floor. We certainly can\u2019t come up here to the tenth floor normally,\u201d another student laughed along. He was surnamed Wang and named Ziquan, and was from Zi Hua City. He was as handsome as Song Zhenguo and was on pretty good terms with Lu Sheng.\u201cNo way, it was just a coincidence\u2026 a coincidence that I met someone I knew\u2026\u201d Chen Yunxi was embarrassed, her face blushing as she stole a glance at Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng sighed inwardly, then smiled at Chen Yunxi and seated himself.The group began to drink and joke boisterously, composing several of what they thought were artful poems. The atmosphere was warm and lively. Lu Sheng was arranged to be seated next to Chen Yunxi. Two ladies had come along, one beside Song Zhenguo and the other beside an aloof-looking student from the institution. It seemed like they were all couples.\u201cBOOM!\u201dSuddenly, a magnificent golden firework exploded outside Yang-Seeking Tower, turning into a giant peony in the night sky.\u201cIt\u2019s begun! It\u2019s begun!!\u201d The crowd cheered and rushed to the edges of the tower to admire the fireworks.[1] ED/N: It\u2019s stated quite vaguely so it\u2019s unclear whether it was the entire Mortal-Sweeping Manor that has been destroyed or a big part of it (the sentence in the raws says faction/power/influence, but since they \u201chave no time to spare\u201d on MC, it suggests there are some who survived)\u2013at least at this point.[2] ED/N: Yep, Yang. However, it likely has nothing to do with Yang energy\u2013there\u2019s something called \u2018Yueyang Tower\u2019 in Yueyang, north Hunan (China), which is one of the 3 most famous pagodas in China. Perhaps the author was lazy as this one differs by the first character only\u2013or perhaps it\u2019s the opposite, the author included some sneaky joke/reference here, and we don\u2019t realize it :3[3] ED/N: Stupa is a kind of Buddhist temple (or a holy place that happens to be a building, sorry, I\u2019m not too familiar with Buddhist stuff) with a dome (round roof).Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Dragon and lights battled on, creating an unusually splendid, lively scene.Balls of golden, red and yellow fireworks shot up into the sky endlessly. The tri-colored fireworks display bathed the entire place in a sea of golden splendor.Enjoying themselves, everybody returned to the table to feast after watching the dragon dance for a while. All who were seated came from merchant families, without a single aristocrat among them. Now that they were caught in the joy of the moment, their real lack of refinement was exposed and all that literary air from earlier vanished in an instant. Each one of them gave themselves in to rowdy exclamations and boisterous laughter as they slapped the tabletop.\u201cIs any Tom, Dick or Harry just let onto the tenth floor now?\u201dAbruptly, an impatient voice rang out from a table on the side.Everybody\u2019s laughter froze as they swiftly turn their heads.On an adjacent table, three refined and learned-looking young scholars were looking derisively towards them.The one who had spoken was a fair-skinned scholar with a long, thin face.\u201cTo think that such uncouth men would be allowed into such a refined place. Looks like this Yang-Seeking Tower is really on the decline,\u201d the scholar mocked.Unexpectedly, the usually unrelenting Song Zhenguo actually went dumb after recognizing the speaker. He looked down and drank his wine silently without uttering a single word.The rest of the group, too, bowed their heads without a sound. As their chatter ceased, the noise level on the floor rapidly dropped. Even Chen Yunxi bit her lower lip without a word. Among their group, she had the best family background, yet even she did not dare to rebut the three. Clearly, they were big shots.\u201cIsn\u2019t this Miss Chen Yunxi? She\u2019s truly a merchant\u2019s daughter inside-out. Even the company she hangs out with all day are these ill-mannered ruffians.Previously, your elder brother put in plenty of good words for you with me, smiling as he offered to give you to me as concubine. I was actually rather tempted at that time. But now, it seems like I made the right choice in rejecting his offer,\u201d said another Young Master, toying with a string of Buddha beads and shaking his head.Upon hearing these words, Cheng Yunxi glanced at Lu Sheng immediately as if shocked by an electric current. Then she quickly lowered her head, her face and neck turning beet red. Her body was even trembling.Yet, none of the eight or nine people at the table even dared to speak a word back at them.Lu Sheng shook his head inwardly. He looked again at Song Zhenguo. His fists were clenched tight and veins had popped up on his neck. Clearly, he was already in an extreme state of anger.\u201cA bunch of cowards,\u201d that thin-faced scholar jeered.\u201cHas your mother never taught you manners? Or do you need this Young Master to teach you a lesson and show you what good upbringing looks like?\u201dWithout warning, a calm voice arose from Chen Yunxi\u2019s side.Originally, the thin-faced scholar had intended not to waste anymore of his time on such men and was about to lift up his wine cup to continue drinking. Little did he expect to hear such words all of a sudden. Immediately, he glared fiercely towards Chen Yunxi.Looks of shock also appeared on the faces of the other two at the table, who also looked in Chen Yunxi\u2019s direction.Song Zhenguo reached out and clutched Lu Sheng\u2019s arm instantly and anxiously signaled him. He himself slowly rose and clasped his hands together at the three and was about to apologize.Lu Sheng smiled and rose, \u201cCausing a din and disturbing others was our fault. But maliciously attacking a lady who has only just come of age with your words\u2026 the three of you are scums.\u201d\u201cComing of age\u201d meant reaching the age for marriage. Here, the marriageable age for ladies was sixteen years old. Chen Yunxi had just turned sixteen; she was three years younger than Lu Sheng.\u201cYou\u2019ve got guts!\u201d The thin-faced scholar rose instantly and glared at Lu Sheng coldly. \u201cTo think that right here, in Mountain-Edge City, there\u2019s actually\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Su De,\u201d the only one among the three of them who had not spoken yet opened his mouth at that moment.At his voice, the other two who were originally furious suppressed their anger and immediately put on a face of gloating. Obviously, the one who had just spoken had come from an even more powerful background.\u201cIt\u2019s just a small matter, let\u2019s leave it as that. It\u2019s time, we\u2019ve got to go,\u201d that Young Master had handsome features and carried an air of composure about him. When he spoke, he emanated a dignified aura, as if the quarrel happening around him was a squabble between kids.\u201cFine\u2026 but only since Young Master Rong has spoken! Hmph!\u201d The thin-faced scholar exclaimed and stared at Lu Sheng viciously.Lu Sheng had already been prepared to teach the three of them a lesson with his fist. He had also noticed several lines of sight zeroing in on him from somewhere behind the three of them, but they were all merely of the Strength Proficiency level. To Lu Sheng, dealing with them was just a matter of a few more moves.There were differences even among Strength Proficiency experts. Someone at the pinnacle of the Strength Proficiency level, like Uncle Zhao back at home, could take on two ordinary Strength Proficiency experts on his own. This was akin to how the same martial art practiced by different people would result in different levels of mastery.Moreover, Lu Sheng was now already an inner force expert. His Black Fury Qi cultivation was effective even against Demonic Ghosts. When used against human beings, its might would probably be even more terrifying.Although he had never tried it, fighting three or five Strength Proficiency experts wasn\u2019t considered much in his eyes. Even the higher-leveled Intent Proficiency expert was at most equivalent to three Strength Proficiency experts\u2013insufficient to pose a threat to him.The three of them slowly departed. The conflict was dissolved just like that. Song Zhenguo released his breath in relief.The moment the three of them left, Chen Yunxi could bear to stay no longer and made her leave with teary eyes. Lu Sheng wanted to see her off but was politely turned down by her before she left in a hurry.The rest of them had lost their interest in admiring the dragon dance. Song Zhenguo sent his female companion away then pulled Lu Sheng and Wang Ziquan along towards the lakeside.Cypress Pine Lake was calm and serene at night. Multi-story pleasure boats decked with red lanterns were gliding across the surface of the lake.Song Zhenguo led the two of them aboard one of the larger pleasure boats with practiced familiarity. The boat mistress, charming despite her age, welcomed them.\u201cYoung Master Song, long time no see. Jun\u2019er\u2019s always been going on and on about you beside my ears.\u201dIn his mind, Lu Sheng remarked that the boat mistress\u2019 speech did not sound sordid in the slightest.\u201cIs Jun\u2019er free now?\u201d Song Zhenguo smiled as he led them in.\u201cNaturally. She\u2019s just waiting for Young Master Song to visit,\u201d the boat mistress laughed. \u201cAs for the other two Young Masters, if there\u2019s any lady to your liking, you can let this servant know as well.\u201dThe three of them were led into an exclusive chamber, which was very artfully decorated.After that, a row of over ten ladies dressed in thin gauze entered. Each one of them had an attractive and svelte figure as well as an air of elegance comparable to that found on a Young Miss from a wealthy family, and each looked attractive in her own way.\u201cMany blessings to three Young Masters,\u201d the ladies curtsied in unison.\u201cBrothers, please pick one each. Tonight\u2019s on me,\u201d Song Zhenguo placed his arm around another lady who came in later and said casually.Wang Ziquan\u2019s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. His face was flushed with excitement as he deliberated over which lady to pick.Lu Sheng\u2019s face, however, was composed. He randomly picked a quiet-looking one to sit beside himself.Having picked the ladies, some nourishing floral tea was served to get them in the mood. In addition, some sexily dressed ladies also entered to play music and dance.\u201cWhat happened today\u2026 it\u2019s really\u2026\u201d Song Zhenguo\u2019s face turned red at the mention of the incident today in Yang-Seeking Tower. It was like a knot on his heart which could not be straightened out.\u201cBrother Song, with such beautiful scenery and wonderful companions by our side, why mention this depressing matter? Come, let\u2019s drink!\u201d Wang Ziquan could no longer keep his hands to himself. His hands roved all over the lady by his side and he clearly couldn\u2019t wait even a second longer.The three ladies giggled incessantly in an attempt to console Song Zhenguo, and even Lu Sheng chipped in with a few words. Only then did Song Zhenguo\u2019s mood turn for the better.\u201cIf my eyes didn\u2019t play any tricks on me today, one of the three who mocked us today is the son of Mountain-Edge City\u2019s Deputy Army Superintendent, Wang Shunyong. There\u2019s nothing much to be said about the others, but this Wang Shunyong is different\u2026\u201d\u201cNot to mention that Young Master Rong\u2026 he must have an even more powerful background,\u201d Wang Ziquan added.Lu Sheng shook his head wordlessly. After being exposed to a more complicated world, a \u2018young master\u2019 or the like did not mean anything to him anymore.\u201cWhy\u2019re we being such wet blankets? Drink on! Drink till you drop!\u201d Wang Ziquan shouted.Song Zhenguo, too, shook off all his troubles and began gulping down his wine.To be honest, Lu Sheng didn\u2019t really like such occasions. But since Song Zhenguo was feeling down, he accompanied him and drank till late in the night.The pleasure boat sold only wine and the arts, not sexual pleasures. By the time the three of them had finished drinking and left, it was already at the height of the Chou hour\u2013that is, somewhere between two and three a.m. in the morning.After parting ways with the two, Lu Sheng remarked to himself about the lowly status of merchants in this world. Even a Young Master and a Miss of wealthy family like Song Zhenguo and Chen Yunxi dared not speak a word against the descendants of officials.Though he had drunk his fill of wine, his mind remained sober and alert, without even the faintest trace of sleepiness. He left Cypress Pine Lake and headed towards his place. On the way, he attempted to hail a carriage several times, but there never was an empty one available.It was too late. Not many carriage drivers remained on the road; most of them had already retired. Hence, he was left with no choice but to hurry home on foot.The streets in the city were cold and deserted past midnight. Only a few drunkards remained on it, spouting nonsense to themselves.The houses on both sides were shrouded in pitch darkness, with the occasional exception of big families who hung lanterns before their doors. They swayed in the wind and emitted faint glow of red light.The wind blew on, making it rather chilly.Lu Sheng sped up. When he was halfway enroute, he suddenly discovered that his waist pouch had gone missing god-knows-when.He touched himself all over but could not find the waist pouch anywhere on him.\u2018It\u2019s got to be on the boat,\u2019 Lu Sheng recalled that the waist pouch contained the note from Duanmu Wan as well as the key to his room\u2019s door. He couldn\u2019t afford to lose it. So, he turned and headed back towards the pleasure boat.Travelling briskly, Lu Sheng went back along the way he had come until he reached Cypress Pine Lake. By this time, most of the pleasure boats by the lakeside had ended their business and had their colored lanterns taken down. The lakeside felt very deserted.He retraced his steps until he quickly reached the pleasure boat from which he had alighted.The pleasure boat had docked; the boat was empty, with no sign or sight of anyone. The yellow lanterns on the deck swayed in the wind.\u2018They must have ended business. The ladies must have gone back to rest and it should be cleaning time now,\u2019 Lu Shen thought to himself as he boarded the pleasure boat from the dock.\u201cIs anybody there?\u201d Lu Sheng called out twice, then walked further into the boat along the deck.The pleasure boat was thoroughly empty. The surface of the deck was unusually clean, with glimmer reflecting off the aged wooden planks, which were painted in green.Lu Sheng entered the boat via its entrance and found himself in a rather cramped corridor, which led into a hall. Both sides of the hall were occupied with row after row of chambers that comprised the three-storied pleasure boat.A small lantern was hung outside the door of each chamber, emitting a faint red glow which made the boat look eerily cold and deserted late in the night.\u201cAnybody there?\u201d Lu Sheng surveyed the hall, yet found not a single person in the entire boat.\u2018I don\u2019t remember seeing so many red lanterns when I just got here\u2026\u2019 his eyes narrowed to a slit as caution rose in his heart.The boat had three stories, and each had five rooms\u2013making it a total of fifteen rooms. Each one of them had a red lantern hung outside its door. Their faint red glow dyed the interior of the entire boat a scarlet red, plunging it into a sea of silent loneliness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0KurisuLu Sheng recalled the way and walked towards the chamber that he had visited earlier.After entering the main hall, he took a left turn up the wooden staircase.When he arrived at the entrance of the chamber, Lu Sheng saw the red lantern hung outside it and could not shake off the chill rising in his heart.\u201cHOO\u2026\u201dSuddenly, a wisp of cold air brushed passed him. Lu Sheng swung around\u2013in that moment earlier, he felt as if something had drifted past him from behind.\u2018Mortal-Sweeping Manor has already been destroyed. Logically speaking, there shouldn\u2019t be any more of the supernatural still coming after me. Perhaps I\u2019m too sensitive,\u2019 Lu Sheng didn\u2019t see anything, which somewhat allayed his fears. He turned back once again and reached out to push the door of the chamber.\u201cKA-CHA.\u201dThe door gently opened. Two big red lanterns also hung inside, lighting the interior in a bright red glow.\u201cAnybody?\u201d Lu Sheng called again as he walked in tentatively.\u201cYes\u2026\u201dSuddenly, a dry, parched voice came from behind Lu Sheng.He spun around and saw an old woman, standing at the entrance of the chamber with a white lantern in hand and her eyes staring widely.This old woman had wizened features; her face wrinkled layer upon layer like the bark of an old tree. Carrying the lantern, her muddled old eyes stared intently at Lu Sheng.\u201cLittle fellow, you shouldn\u2019t be on board the boat at this hour.\u201d\u201cI dropped something here. A waist pouch. So, I\u2019m back to look for it,\u201d Lu Sheng plastered on a smile.\u201cI see\u2026 then go find it, find it, find it,\u201d the old woman remained expressionless. Wordlessly, she turned around and headed towards other chambers with the lantern in hand.Lu Sheng watched as she departed. Only after the old woman had disappeared past the chamber door did he walk over to close it.He turned around and looked at the arrangement within the chamber.The two large lanterns that hadn\u2019t previously been there currently hung high on one side of the walls. Bright-red rays lit up the entire room with a crimson glow.Gingerly, Lu Sheng groped about near the seat that he had sat at earlier. Indeed, in a small crack next to the seat cushion, he found his missing waist pouch.He untied the waist pouch. Within the brown-black leather pouch, his gold and silver notes, the slip of paper, and the small paper packet with powder left behind by the Demonic Ghost were all inside, intact.Collecting the waist pouch and re-attaching it behind his back, Lu Sheng straightened himself. He glanced around the chamber again; the glow from the lanterns seemed to have gotten even redder.The sense that something was amiss crept into his heart.\u2018Gotta go,\u2019 Lu Sheng walked hastily to the chamber entrance and reached out to pull at the door.The door actually wouldn\u2019t budge in the slightest!Lu Sheng was alarmed and exerted greater force with his hands. A door that originally should open with a slight pull now seemed as if there was a great weight braced against it. Even given Lu Sheng\u2019s current strength, it could only budge a mere small crack.\u2018Something\u2019s wrong!\u2019 Alarm bells went off inside Lu Sheng\u2019s head. He circulated his inner strength and pulled fiercely.\u201cBANG!\u201dThe door thrust open violently. The sturdy wooden handle of the door broke apart under the intensity of the force. Lu Sheng shot out like an arrow along the corridor and flew downstairs, speeding through a few twists and shooting outside.Alighting from it, Lu Sheng looked back at the pleasure boat.It was still the same pleasure boat, its upper deck empty and without a single soul to be seen. The alarm bells within Lu Sheng\u2019s mind finally ceased, clearly sensing that the threat was no more.He took one last deep glance at the pleasure boat, then turned and sped off towards the city.He headed straight back home. Lu Sheng opened the door and then flicked his hand to lock it. The pitch-black room was icy cold, without the warmth of human presence.He slowly made his way to the study table and groped around for a flint stone. He struck it to produce some sparks, which he used to light the candles.The faint yellow candlelight caused the lower half of his face to be fuzzily lit.\u2018Perhaps the pleasure boat has got something to do with the supernatural. Who knew that after the Mortal-Sweeping Manor it would be the turn of a red-decked pleasure boat. I\u2019d initially even wanted to relax and chill for a couple of days then begin cultivating a new inner force skill. Now, from the looks of it, there\u2019s no need to wait anymore. I should make whatever preparations I can first.\u2019Lu Sheng left the study table and approached the bed in the room. From beneath the bed, he pulled out a heavy, intricate metal trunk. The trunk was secured fast onto the floor with sliding grooves, and could never be removed by an ordinary person.He carefully felt out and retrieved a small key from within his waist pouch, which he inserted into the trunk. With a twist, it opened with a slight sound, \u201cKA-CHA.\u201dInside the trunk were two small light-brown booklets with cloth covers.Lu Sheng took out one of them and held it in his hands, after which he closed the trunk and locked it.\u2018Green Pine One-Thought Formula\u2019Clearly written on the booklet were these five words, largely emblazoned across the cover like blazing dragons and dancing phoenixes.Lu Sheng gently flipped the first page open. After the brief overview he had read previously, there was that picture of the lone pine on the precipice.He looked at that drawing with rapt attention for a moment. Then, he closed it and sat down cross-legged on the bed, beginning to calm himself and clear his thoughts.He had cultivated this life-force skill on and off for a long time. Perhaps because it conflicted with the inner force skills he had practiced previously, each time he felt that he was about to congeal a sense of Qi, it would be instantly consumed by Jade Crane Skill.This time was no different. Very soon, Jade Crane Skill circulated rapidly within him, swiftly crushing his mental image of the Green Pine One-Thought Formula. In its place, a soaring crane within him seemed to let out a long loud cry.\u2018Ai\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng opened his eyes. \u2018The inner force skills conflict with each other. Don\u2019t tell me I\u2019m doomed to be stuck on this level? Is there no way to advance?\u2019In the moment of frustration, his hand unconsciously grabbed onto his waist pouch and squeezed lightly. As his fingers squeezed onto the paper packet containing the powder, he suddenly jolted.\u2018This paper packet\u2026 contains the bit of powder left behind by the Demonic Ghost previously, doesn\u2019t it?\u2019He lightly opened the packet. Shockingly, there was a lump of black powder inside, yet he seemed to remember that it wasn\u2019t of this color previously.\u2018In the very beginning, I was able to activate my special ability because of the stone left behind by the water ghost and that piece of cobblestone. From the look of things, don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng looked at the powder and a bizarre thought surfaced in his mind.\u2018Deep Blue!\u2019He mouthed resolutely.\u201cSwoosh!\u201dInstantly, a blue frame appeared before his eyes.Lu Sheng looked at the Modifier screen, where there was still no selection for the Green Pine One-Thought Formula. He hesitated for a moment, before taking another look at that powder.He reached out and tilted the paper packet, releasing all the powder into his palms.From the moment he first obtained the powder, he had been very careful not to let it come into direct contact with his skin in case it was a corrosive or poisonous substance. However, now that he was at the end of his tether, he might as well give it a try. If things went awry, he\u2019d immediately fling the thing away at worst.Next, he bit into the forefinger of his other hand viciously. Cutting through the fingertip, he squeezed out a drop of blood that he then dripped onto the powder.\u201cSizzle\u2026!\u201dIndeed, as soon as the drop of blood touched the powder, streams of white smoke suddenly floated out. Very soon, the black powder turned into white powder, as if its color was fading away.Lu Sheng could feel strand after strand of cool Yin energy permeating from his palms and flowing into his body.\u2018Begin martial arts extrapolation?\u2019The cool Yin energy was absorbed by something in his body in the blink of an eye and disappeared. Almost in the same instant, an inquiry surfaced in the dialogue frame of the Deep Blue Modifier.\u2018As I thought!\u2019 Lu Sheng was elated. The skill appeared as he had expected.Earlier, he already had his suspicions when he noticed that a fourth level appeared in his Black Tiger Saber Technique. This Modifier probably extrapolated the martial skill to the next level according to the information reserves in his brain, thereby resulting in the creation of the fourth level of Black Tiger Saber.However, no matter how he had studied other martial skills after that, a similar situation had not occurred ever again. He then grew doubtful.Now, from the looks of it, perhaps it was because he did not have any surviving ghost artifacts. That had likely caused him to be unable to continue martial arts extrapolation to a higher level all this while.\u2018Initially, it was because of the case of the Xu Family being wiped out that the cobblestone was able to activate the Modifier. Now, it depends on this powder left behind by the Demonic Ghost. Looks like this special ability of mine really cannot be separated from ghosts,\u2019 Lu Sheng chuckled bitterly in his heart.Lu Sheng composed himself as he looked at the inquiry in the dialogue box before him.\u2018Begin martial arts extrapolation?\u2019\u2018Yes.\u2019After selecting the option, Lu Sheng instantly felt a strange sensation. It seemed as if all the martial arts within the Modifier could be extrapolated and integrated.All these martial arts and skills were the result of him grasping all the necessary knowledge and developing a sense of self-awareness. It was akin to him reorganizing and restructuring the information reserves in his mind, which were then recalibrated to find new kernels that would serve as the base for redeveloping the martial arts.It was like using building blocks to construct a house, with a whole host of different designs available for choosing.Moreover, beside the martial arts listed in the Modifier, a few buttons available for choosing also appeared.Which ones could be extrapolated, and which ones could not\u2013it was all displayed crystal clear.Lu Sheng scrutinized it from top to bottom.\u2018If Black Fury Skill could be used as the base to absorb other systems, that would be ideal\u2026 Jade Crane Skill can also provide the main structure, and even Black Tiger Saber can act as the base\u2026 Heart-Shattering Palm\u2019s not bad too,\u2019 Lu Sheng hesitated a little. However, he soon felt somewhat helpless. \u2018It\u2019s a pity there\u2019s too little of that powder, and that there are only these few to choose from.\u2019Within the Modifier, he saw that there were only Jade Crane Skill and Black Tiger Saber that currently were available as options.\u2018Only these two are available\u2026?\u2019He made up his mind and pressed the button behind Jade Crane Skill.\u2018Inner force skill is, after all, the most important foundation.\u2019After selecting it, all buttons disappeared and the entire Modifier gradually grew blurry. Lu Sheng could feel the bulk of his knowledge and understanding of Jade Crane Skill within his mind getting livelier of its own volition. Moreover, it fused together with the contents of the manual within his memory, and began to constantly conflict and collide against each other. In the blink of an eye, countless ideas and inspirations were created.In the short space of ten breaths.Lu Sheng shut his eyes, then gradually opened them again. A whole new aura, piercing and cold, emanated from his body.The different ways in which Jade Crane Skill and Black Tiger Saber generated force were now impeccably merged together. This was thus the highest extrapolation for Jade Crane Skill, a result of the Modifier making use of Lu Sheng\u2019s knowledge reserves. Through fusing with the technique for generating force in Black Tiger Saber, this created an explosive-type inner force that was more powerful than the original Jade Crane Skill.This form of a new inner force skill retained the original effect of hardy endurance and recovery power while adding to it a rather murderous explosive strength.\u2018This type of new inner force skill borrows the technique of force generation of Black Tiger Saber, and actually extrapolates a life-force skill to merge it with the destruction power of battle-type inner force skills\u2026 such an extrapolation is indeed powerful!\u2019 Lu Sheng was deeply moved. \u2018If I had more of the powder, or more of that cobblestone left behind by the water ghost from back then, then perhaps I could extrapolate other skills as advanced as Black Fury Skill.\u2019He felt out the new inner force skill. It seemed that with the increase in explosive power, the original self-recovery ability of Jade Crane Skill was also strengthened a sliver.\u2018This is no longer considered Jade Crane Skill. Since it integrated with the force generation technique of Black Tiger Saber Technique, henceforth, it shall be called Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill then,\u2019 he mused.In that same moment, the name for Jade Crane Skill as displayed in the Modifier changed to these five words: Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0KurisuA new inner force skill brought about more than just an internal breakthrough for Lu Sheng. Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill and Black Fury Skill per se were not in a conflict with each other. Now that it had been strengthened, Lu Sheng could feel his energy flooding out unceasingly. The essence, Qi and spirit in his entire person grew much sturdier than before.He rose. Using his hand in place of a saber, he stepped forward and executed Tiger Kill.\u201cCHI!\u201d\u201cHOWL!!!\u201dThe sound of a tiger\u2019s roar was faintly discernible. Instantly, the air grew scorching hot.This effect was but the result of Lu Sheng exerting merely a quarter of his strength. If he wanted to achieve this with his previous skill level, it would have required the explosive power of at least half of his inner Qi.\u2018The effectiveness of inner Qi has increased by at least one-fold!\u2019 Lu Sheng was very excited. He thought back to what Uncle Zhao had once explained to him about the experts in the pugilistic world.\u2018In the pugilistic world, it is rumored that in the Central Plains, Strength Proficiency level experts are only considered a dime a dozen. Above that are two large levels: Intent Proficiency and Spirit Focus. The renowned masters are mostly at the level of Spirit Focus. These masters cultivate both inner and outer force; their spirit and intent become reality. Each and every move manifests the quintessence and Dao of their martial arts. Because of this, their inner Qi flows and abounds unceasingly, and their battle prowess rises radically. I wonder\u2026 which level have I attained?\u2019Lu Sheng reckoned inwardly.\u2018I\u2019ve already unintentionally attained Strength Proficiency in Nine Links City; Black Tiger Saber is thus my one and only Strength Proficiency martial art. However, even if I haven\u2019t attained Spirit Focus yet, the sturdiness of my inner Qi has far surpassed that of the ordinary Strength Proficiency experts.If I really went up against a Spirit Focus opponent, I can\u2019t say for sure whether I\u2019d win or lose. Thus, I can be kinda considered a Spirit Focus expert now, and am comparable in strength to the illustrious names of Central Plains.\u2019He was confident that the inner force of Black Fury Skill and Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill had both reached the pinnacle of the third realm. If an average person were to cultivate these, such a result would be unimaginable without forty, fifty years of training. Moreover, this was given the prerequisite that the person must possess exceptional aptitude and an endless supply of nourishing tonics and ingredients for medicinal baths.\u2018I\u2019m only nineteen years old, and I already have such a robust foundation for cultivation. If there weren\u2019t any supernatural beings, this world would be my oyster! A pity\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng\u2019s heart filled with regret as he remembered the incidents with the Demonic Ghost.Just as he was thinking about this, the cry of a rooster suddenly sounded out from beyond the window.Lu Sheng gazed outside the window; it was now the crack of dawn. The whole night had actually slipped by.He got off the bed and hastily exited to fetch some water to wash his face and rinse his mouth. He dressed in his robes and strode out of his room.He first went to the restaurant nearby for breakfast, where he had his usual fare of meat buns, small-grain porridge and an additional dish of fried vegetables. Though they were simple dishes, their sheer quantity caused the other customers who were likewise dining there to click their tongues in astonishment.Lu Sheng gulped down whole meat buns by the mouthful. Each had thin skin and generous fillings, and was as large as a palm. He also didn\u2019t care that they were scalding hot\u2013ever since he trained in Black Fury Skill, his tolerance for heat had increased by leaps and bounds. Even roasting his hands on top of a burning candle would be bearable for five or six breaths\u2019 of time before he\u2019d find it hot.Each bamboo basket had six buns. Lu Sheng ate five bamboo baskets\u2019 worth in one seating, totaling thirty meat buns. The plate of vegetables came last to relieve the aftertaste, which he lifted to pour straight into his mouth before casually chewing a little and swallowing.It was just like how the ordinary person drank a mouthful of water after finishing a sumptuous meal\u2026The small-grain porridge lay by the side in a bucket as tall as a forearm and as wide as a face basin. The portion within was sufficient for five or six people. Lu Sheng picked it up and took three big mouthfuls from it.He put down the bucket. There was no more porridge inside.\u201cWOW!\u201dThe surrounding diners looking on instantly exclaimed in surprise. For these people who led an unexciting and banal existence, such an eccentric incident would have them spinning exaggerated tales for the next three days.Lu Sheng\u2019s expression remained the same as ever. After finishing his meal, he elegantly wiped the corners of his mouth with a silk handkerchief before rising to take his leave. The immense contrast between before and after left the surrounding customers and waiters wide-eyed and speechless.Inner Qi was formed through tempering one\u2019s essence and converting it into Qi. And where did that essence come from? From food.Lu Sheng bore two major inner force skills, Black Fury Skill and Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill. The origins of Black Fury Skill were extraordinary, and though it was incomplete, its effectiveness was remarkable\u2013it could even injure the supernatural. As for the new life-force skill, Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill, which Lu Sheng had extrapolated to its extreme, it was a skill that mainly recuperated the body to begin with.Both of them together caused Lu Sheng\u2019s appetite to grow quite voracious.After his breakfast, Lu Sheng flagged down a horse carriage to head straight towards Eastern Mountain Institute. Upon arrival, he made it just in time as the morning bells sounded.Lu Sheng alighted and sped into the Institution, hurrying towards the study hall where he was supposed to be.Eastern Mountain Institute stood on a large plot of land, situated at the foot of Eastern Mountain located just outside Mountain-Edge City. Although in close proximity to the city, it was not under the city\u2019s jurisdiction but rather had their private soldiers and governance system. The Dean was addressed as the Cavern Chief, a no-nonsense high-grade official from the Court whose appointment was also decided by the said Court. It was an entirely different system from Mountain-Edge City.Legend has it that the Institution was founded by an important Confucian official, who returned to his hometown after his appointment to an office. Subsequently, it gradually expanded and grew to become the Eastern Mountain Institution many years later.Lu Sheng rushed towards his study hall with great familiarity. The one teaching them was Lu Rao, Elder Lu, a provincial imperial examination graduate who had passed the Scholar Examination. [1]Elder Lu was already standing at the front by the rostrum, currently about to flip open the class register to take attendance.Lu Sheng and a few other students tip-toeing in gingerly gave slight bows in his direction before hurrying to their seats.The study hall was a rectangular room within which sat ten over students, scattered in their various seats. These were all the students Elder Lu was responsible for.Lu Sheng\u2019s seat was right next to Song Zhenguo. As he got seated, he tidied his robes and sat upright, preparing for the lesson by retrieving his humanities books from the bookcase.Each of the students would have appointed someone to prepare the required books for the day\u2019s lessons and leave them in the bookcase in advance. The bookcase also acted as the study desk, albeit a shorter version since everyone was sitting down cross-legged.\u201cDu Zhenxu.\u201d\u201cPresent.\u201d\u201cWang Dao.\u201d\u201cPresent.\u201d\u201cZhao Banyue.\u201d\u201cPresent.\u201d\u201cYan Song.\u201d\u201cPresent.\u201dElder Lu\u2019s face was impassive as he read of the names one by one. It was soon Lu Sheng\u2019s turn.\u201cLu Sheng.\u201d\u201cPresent.\u201d\u201cSong Zhenguo.\u201d\u201cPresent.\u201d\u201cWang Ziquan. Wang Ziquan\u2026?\u201dElder Lu\u2019s eye twitched as his stern gaze swept across the students seated before him. Naturally, he had already long since committed to memory the ten over students\u2019 names and facial features. Now, with this one glance, he wanted to confirm if Wang Ziquan was indeed absent.\u201cWang Ziquan\u2019s not here?\u201d He asked again.Song Zhenguo cast a strange look at Wang Ziquan\u2019s seat; indeed, it was empty.\u201cPerhaps something urgent cropped up at home, and he\u2019s returned to his hometown?\u201d He whispered under his breath.Lu Sheng looked over. Wang Ziquan was indeed absent. Somehow, he suddenly recalled the bizarre pleasure boat from last night.\u201cMaybe he\u2019s overslept?\u201dAs he said that, Song Zhenguo was instantly astonished. He seemed to remember something and an odd smile appeared on his face.The two spoke no further. Seeing that the student was indeed absent, Elder Lu gave a harrumph as he lifted a charcoal pen to strike out Wang Ziquan\u2019s name.\u201cWe\u2019ll now begin the day\u2019s lesson. Previously, we talked about\u2026\u201d Elder Lu began to focus on explaining the contents of the book without further ado.Lu Sheng listened for a bit before looking over to Wang Ziquan\u2019s seat again. He could not shake off the feeling that Wang Ziquan\u2019s absence was perhaps related to that pleasure boat.Roughly two hours later, the lesson ended. Elder Lu carried his books and promptly left.Lu Sheng and Song Zhenguo rose to their feet.\u201cLooks like Young Master Sheng is confident of doing well in the Annual Examinations!\u201d Song Zhenguo teased Lu Sheng mischievously, grinning as he did so. \u201cI saw that Young Master wasn\u2019t the least bit sluggish or confused throughout the lesson. Clearly, you\u2019ve long since understood the profound mysteries of these principles! The day you top the examinations is just round the corner!\u201d\u201cStop it, Brother Zhenguo,\u201d Lu Sheng chuckled. He rather admired Song Zhenguo\u2013straightforward and generous, he did not put on airs around classmates whose backgrounds paled in comparison to his wealthy family. Most importantly, he was extremely loyal. When friends turned to him to help, he would agree without hesitation as long as it was something within his power.\u201cChen Yunxi is here. Yesterday, you stood up the pretty lady, and now it seems that her heart is dead set on you. Run along!\u201d Song Zhenguo looked over at the study hall entrance and winked enthusiastically at Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng turned around and saw Chen Yunxi standing at the entrance, the picture of grace. She wore a pure white, long dress of gauze material from head to toe. White cotton fluffy sleeves hung down her hands, partially covering something she was holding.Her long hair was tied up in a small bun at the top of her head, secured in place by a white jade hairpin. Only a lock of black tresses rested at the side of her chest. She had lengthy legs, a slender waist, skin like jade, tall lithe body, and a full bosom.She looked elegant and pure like a fairy. In that instant, Lu Sheng\u2019s heart was somewhat moved.\u201cWho\u2019s that girl? Such long legs! Simply hideous!\u201d A scholar by the side whispered, immediately ruining the atmosphere.\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026 her legs are so long that it hurts the eyes. If that weren\u2019t the case, this Young Master would have pursued this lady way earlier.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 it\u2019s Chen Yunxi. If her legs weren\u2019t that ugly, given her family\u2019s illustrious wealth in Mountain-Edge City, there would have been a long line of suitors. What a pity\u2026\u201d\u201cSuper hideous legs!\u201d\u201cYea that\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cEnough with it, you guys. It\u2019s not her fault that she looks like that; our physical traits are all passed down to us by our parents. Who would want to look so deficient from birth? We are all fellow students. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s disrespectful to criticize another student\u2019s appearance so much?\u201d One of the female students had had enough and advised.\u201cAi\u2026\u201dThe group of students dispersed in a commotion.Lu Sheng looked at Chen Yunxi\u2019s beautiful legs, which he considered dazzling in his eyes. He then looked at the other students, who all averted their gazes as if they couldn\u2019t bear to look. He was dumbfounded.\u201cGo quickly, Chen Yunxi has dressed up specially for you,\u201d Song Zhenguo knew a bit of what was going on between Lu Sheng and Chen Yunxi, and gave Lu Sheng a few shoves.Lu Sheng hurried over. He grasped onto Chen Yunxi\u2019s hand with a flourish and led her out of the study hall in the direction of the Institution\u2019s lecture theater.The lecture theater was where the Institution would hold special lectures by renowned individuals from time to time. Ordinarily, few people visited the area, making it the place where students would go to bill and coo.In this world, both men and women had the right to education, as well as the right to take up an official post. While men and women weren\u2019t completely equal in status, it was somewhat similar to the Tang Dynasty of ancient China that Lu Sheng had in mind.Both of them jogged the entire way towards a patch of forest next to the lecture theater. The forest was near the wall of the mountain, where it was dim and rather cool.Only then did Lu Sheng stop in his tracks and turned around to face Chen Yunxi.\u201cWhat made you come over? As for what happened yesterday, are you alright?\u201dChen Yunxi smiled a little and stretched out a hand from her sleeves. Surprisingly, there was a stalk of delicate red peony between her fingers, plump and glistening.\u201cThis is for you.\u201dLu Sheng stared blankly as he received the flower. Although women in this age were bolder and more open-minded, there were still very few who would take as much initiative as Chen Yunxi did.Chen Yunxi smiled as she said, \u201cPreviously, my family wanted to arrange a marriage with that guy from yesterday. My brother went over to try all sorts of ways to curry favor with them to get them to agree, but in the end, it still didn\u2019t go through. They didn\u2019t even fancy me as a concubine.\u201dThere was a faint anguish in her smile.\u201cI know that I don\u2019t look good, my legs are too long\u2026 it\u2019s very understandable that others don\u2019t fancy me. It pains me each time to hear others criticizing my long legs\u2026 I can\u2019t help but lower my head, unable to hear any more of it.\u201dThe corner of Lu Sheng\u2019s mouth twitched. No matter how he looked at it, her words seemed strange to him. A strong sense of contradiction arose in his heart that he was unable to shake off.\u201cBut I\u2019ve got no choice. Who\u2019s to blame for the fact that I was born with long legs?\u201d Chen Yunxi lifted her head and looked at him with a pained expression. \u201cI know you probably don\u2019t fancy me, but I really like you very much\u2026\u201dShe gritted her teeth as she retrieved a stack of copper-sealed papers from her waist pouch, which she gently unfolded.\u201cMy father has said that since Elder Brother Lu\u2019s family wishes to relocate to a bigger city, why don\u2019t you just move over here. As long as you are willing, these merchant deeds of fifteen restaurants in Mountain-Edge City are yours. It should be enough for the Lu Family to find its footing.\u201d[1] TL/N: The family names of Lu (\u8def) Sheng and Lu (\u5362) Rao refer to different Chinese characters, despite both sharing the same sound \u2018Lu\u2019. They can be best understood as homophones which in English share the same pronunciation but are spelled differently. ED/N: Actually, there\u2019s a slight difference in pronunciation (4th tone vs 2nd tone), but it is so slight that a non-Chinese speaker wouldn\u2019t even notice it, and apparently Chinese themselves are troubled by it sometimes, hence Blue didn\u2019t mention it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0KurisuLu Sheng was instantly stunned.Mountain-Edge City and Nine Links City were incomparably different. A restaurant in Mountain-Edge City was worth at least ten restaurants in Nine Links City!And there were actually FIFTEEN such restaurants here! This way exceeded the typical extravagance! Even if his entire Lu Family\u2019s assets were sold off, it might not even be enough to purchase them.This was because, apart from the money required on the surface, to be able to establish a restaurant in such a place, there were too many other dealings to be made under the table that would require vast resources. All in all, this would incur at least over a million taels\u2019 worth of silver notes. This was already more than half of what the Lu Family had.THIS was what tyranny looked like!In this precise moment, Lu Sheng understood what was meant by \u201cmoney means power\u201d and \u201cmoney makes the world go round\u201d! And, what it meant to be a man-pet\u2026Money aside, just the sheer power of Old Master Chen\u2019s network and connections was impressive. As long as he went along with it, it would be a great deal easier to get his hands on all sorts of martial arts. Not to mention the supply of nourishing tonics and medicine\u2026There was no way to compare Mountain-Edge City and Nine Links city. This place was considered a strategic, centrally-located town; a stronghold guarding the narrow divide between the Northern lands and the Central Plains. The head of the city had direct access to the highest levels of the Court.Being able to gain a foothold here and be among the wealthiest, Old Master Chen enjoyed influence and benefits beyond what Lu Sheng could fathom. He was definitely not as mediocre as the Young Master from the day before made him out to be.Now, Chen Yunxi had confessed her feelings for him. Lu Sheng knew that although women were bolder and more straightforward in this age, it still required great courage for them to confess. Yet, it was exactly what Chen Yunxi had done.He inhaled deeply as he looked at the girl before him, almost within his reach.\u201cYou keep these first.\u201dHearing that, Chen Yunxi took a careful look at Lu Sheng, then glanced towards the merchant deeds in her hands. Lightly biting onto her lips, she kept the merchant deeds.\u201cBrother Lu, you\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have feelings towards you\u2026 for others, they see your legs as a defect, a deformity given by the gods. However, from my perspective, your legs are instead the most beautiful part about you,\u201d Lu Sheng could not help but blurt out these words. He had to get them off his chest!As Chen Yunxi listened to him, she thought that Lu Sheng was trying to console her. Yet when she looked carefully into Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes, she could see his sincerity.\u201cBut,\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s tone took a turn, \u201cChen Yunxi, are you sure you really know me? Do you really know the kind of person I am? We\u2019ve only known each other for a few months. The side of me that you see is just the side of me when I\u2019m in school. You don\u2019t truly know who I am, and there are parts of you that I don\u2019t really know about. I don\u2019t want my future other half to regret her decision when she sees the other sides of me.\u201dActually, he had said what he just did mostly in the hopes of not dragging Chen Yunxi into his life.His life was a whole different story from the normalcy of the average John\u2019s. He had the Modifier, and even encountered Demonic Ghosts and other supernatural entities.He had to strengthen himself! He wasn\u2019t satisfied to lead a cavalier and ignorant life as a mere mortal, depending on luck and other people for his survival. He wanted to be the master of his own fate in this dark and dangerous world!This was what he wanted. Yet, such a life and pursuit were fraught with danger. Getting married too early was but a weakness in his eyes, which would make him vulnerable.After hearing what he had to say, Chen Yunxi was unexpectedly not disappointed. Instead, both her eyes shone brightly.\u2018Brother Lu doesn\u2019t give a damn about money. Yunxi just knew it wasn\u2019t a wrong choice!\u2019 Her beautiful eyes sparkled radiantly. She stared unflinchingly at Lu Sheng through those big and watery eyes.\u201cSince Brother Lu is not willing to agree for now, Yunxi will listen to you. I\u2019ll do my best to get to know you better in the future, to know everything about you, and to accept everything about you!\u201d Once she finished speaking, she bade a soft \u2018ciao\u2019 before spinning around and running off, her reddened face buried in both her hands.Lu Sheng gazed upon her disappearing back, speechless.\u2018I guess that was counter-productive?\u2019Shaking his head, he returned to the study hall for the rest of the day\u2019s lessons.The day passed by unknowingly. However, there was still no trace of Wang Ziquan. Song Zhenguo took some time to visit the rental house where he was staying temporarily but saw no one. Worried, he and Lu Sheng arranged to search for Wang Ziquan the next day if he still hadn\u2019t appeared.The night passed and it was the next day. As per normal, Lu Sheng stepped into the study hall in the nick of time. When Elder Lu had begun his lesson, Wang Ziquan was still not there.Elder Lu took attendance and again asked after him.\u201cMy rental house is near Wang Ziquan\u2019s. Yesterday night, there was no light lit in his room. Seems like he went out,\u201d a somewhat frail-looking student rose and replied.\u201cDid he return to his hometown?\u201d Elder Lu frowned. \u201cEven if he did, he should have applied for leave from the school! Ridiculous! He doesn\u2019t care for the Annual Examinations recommendation anymore, is that it?\u201dTo participate in the Annual Examinations, it required the joint recommendation of the Institution, which would submit a list of names. Otherwise, it would not possible to take the examinations. If the student\u2019s performance in the Institution was lackluster, then he would not be recommended and would lose all qualifications to enter the Annual Examinations.\u201cThe Annual Examinations are around the corner, there\u2019s no way Wang Ziquan would be this reckless,\u201d Song Zhenguo muttered under his breath. He hastily stood up, \u201cElder Lu, perhaps Wang Ziquan met with some urgent matters. I know his cousin in the city, let me ask him about it later.\u201d\u201cMm, go ahead. It is only right for fellow schoolmates to help each other out,\u201d a glimmer of praise flickered in Elder Lu\u2019s eyes.The incident passed and the lesson continued.Lu Sheng looked at Song Zhenguo. Brows furrowed, he seemed to be worrying about Wang Ziquan. He focused himself and also thought back to the pleasure boat he visited late the other night.Perhaps asking Song Zhenguo about it will provide some clues.They endured all the way till the end of the school day. For Lu Sheng, the lectures didn\u2019t pose any difficulty. With his qualifications as a research student in his past life, dealing with all these was a piece of cake. [1]However, it was very difficult for Song Zhenguo to learn once he was distracted. Even after the lesson ended, he was still bent over his desk, trying to organize all the contents of Elder Lu\u2019s lecture before recording them down.\u201cBrother Zhenguo,\u201d Lu Sheng whispered as he walked over, \u201cI feel there\u2019s something amiss. Ordinarily, Wang Ziquan is extremely prudent and careful. Among all of us, he is the most conscientious when it comes to schoolwork. How could he have missed lessons for two consecutive days?\u201dSong Zhenguo kept his ink and brush. Similarly, he wore a doubtful expression. \u201cI\u2019ve just been thinking about that too, so I\u2019ve decided to go find out.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go together. I\u2019m also quite worried,\u201d Lu Sheng said grimly.Song Zhenguo cast a surprised look at Lu Sheng. Actually, between lessons, he had approached some students he regularly hung out with. Not one of these people, who usually seemed very close on the surface, was willing to go to the trouble of asking around. Once they heard of the matter, each one promptly found an excuse to shirk any responsibility. This allowed him to see the true colors of such \u2018friends\u2019, causing him to feel despondent.Little did he expect that Lu Sheng would take the initiative to approach him and ask to go along.\u201cThat\u2019s good. Wait a while for me Brother Lu, let me pack my things.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dAfter Song Zhenguo tidied up his belongings, both of them hurried out of the Institution. They boarded the horse carriage they had booked in advance and sped straight for the city.All throughout the journey, both of them were somewhat troubled. Given Wang Ziquan\u2019s character, he placed the greatest importance on the Institution\u2019s Annual Examinations above everything else. How could he have suddenly disappeared without a trace?At a cosmetic powder stall along Gold Origins Street in Mountain-Edge City, they both soon found Chen Hong, Wang Ziquan\u2019s younger cousin. Despite his tender age, he was already managing his own business as the boss of the stall.\u201cElder Cousin Ziquan? No\u2026 if he wanted to go back home, he would usually come here to ask me if I have anything for him to bring back\u2013books, clothes, and the like\u2026 speaking of which, I haven\u2019t seen him around these couple of days. Didn\u2019t Elder Cousin hang out with Brother Song you guys previously?\u201d Wang Ziquan\u2019s younger cousin, Chen Hong, puzzled over the matter.Song Zhenguo\u2019s face darkened in worry. He looked at Lu Sheng as they exchanged glances.\u201cYea, previously we did hang out together. It\u2019s just that\u2026 we haven\u2019t seen him these two days, so we came to ask you.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 come to think of it, Elder Cousin did drop by my place the night before yesterday, and asked me for a couple of high-grade fragrances and cosmetic powders,\u201d Chen Hong smiled, \u201cI think, eight out of ten chances he is in love! Hehe, the fragrances and cosmetic powders were even the type that young girls like, tsk tsk tsk\u2026\u201d\u201cThe night before? What time?\u201d Lu Sheng abruptly asked, an odd expression on his face.\u201cAround the Chou hour\u2026 anyway, it was very late, and I was already asleep. Elder Cousin knocked on the door and woke me up, insisting that I come down to get the things for him. Ai\u2026 because he woke me up at such wee hours, the incident is still etched in my memory,\u201d Chen Hong stroked his chin and said, \u201cSpeaking of which, to take fragrances and cosmetic powders so late into the night\u2026 tsk tsk\u2026\u201d a smile universally understood by all men appeared on his face. [ED/N: 1-3 A.M.]Song Zhenguo was stunned, his brows knit tightly together. There was something he couldn\u2019t figure out.As for Lu Sheng, he could already make some guesses. His heart sank.Seeing Lu Sheng\u2019s expression, Song Zhenguo could tell that Lu Sheng had some ideas about what happened. He thus bid a hasty farewell to Chen Hong.Outside of the stall, he pulled Lu Sheng into a corner of the street.\u201cYue Sheng, quick, share with me! Have you thought of any leads?! Wang Ziquan didn\u2019t even tell his own younger cousin. It was the night before yesterday that he came here\u2026 but wasn\u2019t he drinking with us at the pleasure boat that night?\u201d His expression was grave.Lu Sheng stared at Song Zhenguo in all seriousness. \u201cZhenguo, actually, I made a trip back to the pleasure boat the other night after we left.\u201dSong Zhenguo was shocked, \u201cYue Sheng, why did you head back? It was already very late, the pleasure boats should have already been closed for the night, right?\u201d\u201cYes, they were closed,\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s tone was solemn. \u201cIt\u2019s only \u2018cos I left my money pouch back on the boat that I went back to search for it. Little did I expect\u2026\u201d\u201cLittle did you expect what?\u201d Affected by Lu Sheng\u2019s tone and mood, Song Zhenguo\u2019s expression also turned solemn.\u201cLittle did I expect that there wasn\u2019t a single soul left on board the pleasure boat. Instead, red lanterns hung all over the place,\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes narrowed as he continued, \u201cI quickly went into the room we were at. Two huge additional lanterns hung inside, yet there was no one to be seen. Not even any of the cleaners were in sight. Then, I found my money pouch and rushed to leave.\u201d\u201cNot a single soul\u2026 could it be\u2026\u201d suddenly, Song Zhenguo seemed to recall something. \u201cCould it be that Wang Ziquan came to find his younger cousin in the wee hours of the night, just to buycosmetic powders and fragrances for the ladies at the pleasure boats? But since you also went back, then why\u2026\u201d\u201cAbsolutely possible!\u201d Lu Sheng shared his thought. \u201cThere\u2019s no use guessing, let\u2019s head straight to the pleasure boat to ask.\u201dHearing that, Song Zhenguo nodded.Speaking no more, the two of them once again hailed a horse carriage and sped in the direction of Cypress Pine Lake. Dusk was just breaking, which was the ideal time for merry-making and drinking.With great familiarity, Song Zhenguo led Lu Sheng to find the pleasure boat that they patronized previously. It was called Ying Ying Pleasure Boat. [2]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The two of them followed behind a few guests who were boarding the ship and quickly got on the deck.\u201cYoung Master Song, it\u2019s been a few days since we last met and your face looks much more radiant than before,\u201d the boat mistress greeted them, her face all smiles. \u201cJun\u2019er is still dolling up. Why don\u2019t you take a seat first and listen to some tunes to relieve the boredom while waiting? We\u2019ve got a few new singers here who\u2019re very good at what they do.\u201dSong Zhenguo\u2019s face remained stern and did not return her smile.\u201cI want to ask about something. Two days ago I brought a friend here\u2013a young master named Wang Ziquan. I heard that he came to this pleasure boat again afterwards. Please ask the lady who accompanied him two nights ago to come out. I have some questions for her,\u201d he dropped a few pieces of silver into the boat mistress\u2019 hand.This casual gift was basically equivalent to a few thousand dollars. If his family wasn\u2019t wealthy, there would be no way he would have dared to spend like that.\u201cOh you mean Die\u2019er. Mm, I\u2019ll call her out right away. Young Master may rest and wait in the chamber on the side,\u201d seeing the stern looks on Song Zhenguo and Lu Sheng\u2019s face, the boat mistress dared not delay. Customers who were as open-handed as Song Zhenguo were few and far between. Even the descendants of officials were not as generous as Song Zhenguo despite their more powerful backgrounds. [1]The duo including Lu Sheng were led to a chamber to rest and wait. Not long after, the girl called Die\u2019er was summoned into the chamber.Die\u2019er looked extremely mild and meek, drawing the sympathy of those who looked at her. She was dressed in a long green dress and was clutching a long flute in her hand, as if she was about to perform in front of customers. Presently, she looked quite befuddled about being summoned so abruptly.\u201cYoung Master Song, may I know what questions you have for Die\u2019er?\u201d She asked meekly.\u201cLet me ask you this: do you know where that Young Master Wang Ziquan, whom you accompanied two nights ago, is?\u201dDie\u2019er\u2019s face drew a blank.\u201cYoung Master Wang Ziquan? Oh\u2026 I remember now. Didn\u2019t he leave with you, Young Master Song? At that time, Die\u2019er was exhausted, so after Young Master left, I left the boat and went home to rest.\u201d\u201cWent home to rest?\u201d Song Zhenguo\u2019s brow rose.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Back then, Die\u2019er had just accompanied three customers consecutively. I was so very exhausted. Once it ended, I told the boat mistress and was one of the first few who got off the boat,\u201d Die\u2019er replied meekly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did\u2026 did something happen to Young Master Ziquan?\u201d She grew anxious.Lu Sheng examined her closely with his hawkish eyes, but saw no indication that Die\u2019er was lying.\u201cLet me ask you, did your boat close for business right after we left?\u201dUnsettled by Lu Sheng\u2019s stare, Die\u2019er hurriedly nodded her head. \u201cYes, yes! Once you three Young Masters left, the boat mistress closed the boat for business.\u201d\u201cThen let me ask you again! After closing for business, will red lanterns usually be hung on this boat?\u201d Lu Sheng asked again.\u201cRed lanterns?\u201d Die\u2019er was bewildered. \u201cWhat red lanterns? Each day after closing for business, our boat always docks in the nearby harbor for inspection and maintenance. No lights are allowed on the boat during the inspection and maintenance except for those lit by the maintenance personnel. Everything was as per usual yesterday.\u201d\u201cDocks in the nearby harbor? Not here?\u201d Lu Sheng was stunned.\u201cOf course not. We only dock here temporarily while doing business. Waves here can get rather huge\u2026 wouldn\u2019t it be easy to be carried away by the wind if we docked here?\u201d Die\u2019er looked at Lu Sheng with a strange expression.Worry crept into Lu Sheng\u2019s heart. It seems like Wang Ziquan, like him, had boarded the pleasure boat decked with red lanterns.\u201cBrother Lu\u2026\u201d Song Zhenguo felt something was amiss as he listened on. He had no idea what Lu Sheng was trying to drive at with his questions. In his eyes, Lu Sheng had boarded the boat with red lanterns by mistake. Still, he listened on patiently.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that there\u2019s no boat here at night that\u2019s decked with red lanterns? An empty pleasure boat? It\u2019s the exact same model as this boat,\u201d Lu Sheng asked again, unwilling to give up.Die\u2019er blinked.\u201cYoung Master, may I know where you heard about this big boat with red lanterns? Do you know under what kind of circumstances only do we put up red lanterns here?Only when a lady on the boat has passed away do we hang three red lanterns outside her room door and inside her room.One at the door\u2013to guide her home. Two inside her room\u2013to pay respects to her and to give her rest.\u201dUpon hearing, Lu Sheng stood rooted to the ground, dumbfounded.He recalled the eccentric pleasure boat decked with red lanterns all over. Red lanterns hung outside every single room and chamber!And the arrangement in which they were hung was exactly as Die\u2019er described\u2013one outside the door and two inside the room!!!\u201cAhhh\u2026 this is so scary! Young Master, you must\u2019ve heard some horror story from somewhere and come to scare Die\u2019er, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Die\u2019er got the jitters and goosebumps surfaced all over her body.\u201cYue Sheng\u2026 were you having a nightmare?\u201d Song Zhenguo too looked worriedly at Lu Sheng. Lu Sheng\u2019s other name was Yue Sheng, which was essentially the word \u201cSheng\u201d taken apart.Lu Sheng had rarely used this other name in Nine Links City. There, everyone had addressed him as Young Master Sheng or Brother Sheng. But within the academic circle, calling someone by his other name was both more familiar and formal at the same time. [2]\u201cIt\u2019s nothing\u2026 I just\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng hesitated, but kept the story of how he had been almost trapped in the red boat to himself. Even if he had said it, Song Zhenguo might not have believed his words. And even if he did believe him, it made no actual difference anyway.\u201cBut since Ziquan did not come to this pleasure boat, where else could he have gone?\u201d Song Zhenguo was worried. \u201cThe Annual Examinations are almost upon us. If we break the Institution\u2019s rules and have our names forfeited, our future would be ruined in our own hands!\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else from both Young Masters, please excuse Die\u2019er to perform the flute for the customers,\u201d Die\u2019er said softly.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else. Thank you, Die\u2019er. Here, this is for you,\u201d Song Zhenguo passed her a few pieces of silver.Die\u2019er\u2019s face lit up immediately. This would go to her individual earnings apart from what she got on the pleasure boat. She carefully kept the silver pieces in her waist pouch and spun around, heading towards the door. Halfway there, a thought suddenly came to her mind and she turned around, saying, \u201cOh yes, Young Master. Die\u2019er did once hear a ghost story that was spread among the ladies on the boat.It was about a red boat on this Cypress Pine Lake in the past. Its name was Scarlet Decks. A big fire killed everyone; none of the ladies on the boat managed to escape. After that, the legend of the Scarlet Decks began spreading on Cypress Pine Lake\u2026 rumor has it that the boat was decked with red lanterns. No one who boarded that red boat had ever gotten off it.\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s spirits lifted and he quickly halted Die\u2019er.\u201cPlease stay, Miss. Can you tell us more about the story of this pleasure boat called Scarlet Decks?\u201d\u201cErr\u2026 Die\u2019er has only just entered this profession recently and doesn\u2019t know much. But isn\u2019t Young Master Song very intimate with Miss Jun\u2019er? Do you know that Sis Jun\u2019er misses Young Master Song every single day? She\u2019s been working on this boat for quite a long time. She should know,\u201d Die\u2019er replied.\u201cGot it,\u201d Lu Sheng nodded. \u201cCarry on.\u201dDie\u2019er exited. Neither Lu Sheng nor Song Zhenguo said a word. Both remained silent, contemplating different issues.Not long after, Jun\u2019er strolled in, dressed in a low-cut, short, plain white dress, her eyes lighting up upon sighting Song Zhenguo.\u201cYoung Master Song!\u201d Her eyes shone with rich tenderness, unbeknownst to herself.\u201cJun\u2019er!\u201d Song Zhenguo strode forward and put his arm around Jun\u2019er gently. \u201cIt\u2019s been a few days, how\u2019ve you been? I\u2019ve been paying your boss enough money. Apart from me, no one else can request for you.\u201dJun\u2019er nodded lightly, bliss blossoming on her face. \u201cJun\u2019er knows that Young Master\u2019s very good to Jun\u2019er\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting\u2026 waiting for the day when Jun\u2019er will agree to let me redeem you,\u201d Song Zhenguo said gently. \u201cAlright, we\u2019ve come here today to ask about that Young Master Wang Ziquan who came with us the night before. Does Jun\u2019er know if Young Master Wang ever came back to this boat after we left that night?\u201d\u201cYoung Master Wang Ziquan?\u201d Jun\u2019er searched her memory. \u201cIt was already very late that night. Didn\u2019t that Young Master Wang get off the boat with both of you? Why would he return?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re sure he never returned?\u201d Lu Sheng followed up with a question.Jun\u2019er nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sure. Because, I took even longer than usual that night and ended up being the last to get off the boat. Now to think of it, it was probably about a joss stick\u2019s duration after you left.\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026 that\u2019s strange\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng fell in thought.Song Zhenguo asked a couple more questions, which Jun\u2019er answered one by one. Her words corroborated what Die\u2019er had supplied. Since neither of them could discover any leads, they left the boat helplessly.\u201cLooks like our last resort now is to report the case to the authorities,\u201d Song Zhenguo sighed.Lu Sheng shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m worried that even that wouldn\u2019t be of any use\u2026\u201dSong Zhenguo looked at Lu Sheng, puzzled.\u201cBrother Song, I think you should go home. Let\u2019s call it a day\u2026 it\u2019s getting late,\u201d Lu Sheng reminded, \u201cBesides, we\u2019ve still got the preliminary examination tomorrow.\u201d\u201cAlright, then. I\u2019ll head back first. Yue Sheng, if you get any leads, you must inform me,\u201d Song Zhenguo sighed again, then parted ways with Lu Sheng.After watching Song Zhenguo board a horse carriage and disappear into the distance, Lu Sheng searched his memory, examining the reactions of Die\u2019er and Jun\u2019er when he spoke to them. However, he discovered no loopholes.\u201cLooks like they weren\u2019t lying. But, if that red boat wasn\u2019t the one we were on, why would my money pouch be on it?\u201d Lu Sheng doubted.He had the faint premonition that he had just gotten himself embroiled in a new mess.***Song Zhenguo sat in the horse carriage, sighing over and over.He was a sentimental person. Wang Ziquan was someone who had gone missing after going out with him and no news about him could be heard yet. No matter what, he had to give the Wang Family an explanation.Moreover, Ziquan was his good buddy, too. How could an adult like him disappear just like that by Cypress Pine Lake?\u2018Could it be\u2026\u2019 he suddenly thought of a possibility. \u2018Could he have fallen into the lake!?\u2019 At this thought, he shivered from top to toe.\u2018No! If he\u2019s alive, I need to find him. If he\u2019s dead, I need to see his corpse! Ziquan was there because of me. If something really happened to him, then I, Song Zhenguo, am responsible for him!\u2019 Song Zhenguo steeled his heart and set his mind on his decision. \u2018If Ziquan really met with some mishap, I\u2019ll go to the authorities!\u2019He had made his mind up.\u2018But then, what about Jun\u2019er?\u2019 he thought of his beloved Jun\u2019er. His monthly expenditure on her alone amounted to more than a thousand silver notes, just so that he could reserve Jun\u2019er for himself and keep other customers away from her. He had already had more than ten quarrels with his aged father at home because of that.At the thought of this, a headache came upon Song Zhenguo.He quickly arrived home. After paying for the carriage after alighting, he walked into the courtyard and headed straight for his room. He did not want to see anyone in his family for even a second.A few servant-maids saw him and were about to greet him. But in the blink of an eye, he was already gone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Kurisu\u201cCreak. \u201dClosing the door, Song Zhenguo walked towards the window ledge and happened to see a black pigeon with a pair of powdery white eyes. It was stooping on the window frame and brushing its feathers, minding its own business.Seeing that, he was suddenly jolted and rushed to grab ahold of the pigeon. Lightly, he retrieved from its leg a small rolled note.Opening up the rolled note, he could clearly see a row of graceful words written on it:\u2018Brother Song, regarding the matter of Young Master Wang, Jun\u2019er will ask around for you.Another matter\u2013the Scented Satin Festival is around the corner. Brother Song, can you promise Jun\u2019er that, no matter what, you won\u2019t visit the pleasure boat at that time? No matter what!\u2019Song Zhenguo was surprised. He continued reading.\u2018On that day, the boat mistress will make use of the ladies to come up with gimmicks and scams. There are even some arrangements to Brother Song\u2019s disadvantage. Promise me! Jun\u2019er will make sure to settle everything. Once this Scented Satin Festival is over, Jun\u2019er promises to go home with Brother Song\u2026\u2019After Song Zhenguo finished reading the contents of the rolled note, his face broke into a wide grin.\u201cBrother Song promises you! I definitely won\u2019t give them a chance!\u201d He had some misgivings about the matter, especially considering the rather implausible explanation presented. However, because he trusted Jun\u2019er, he didn\u2019t have any suspicions.Hastily, Song Zhenguo found some paper on which he wrote his reply. Then, rolling it up into the shape of a cylinder, he tied it to the leg of the black pigeon. With both hands, he held up the black pigeon and threw it outwards. Immediately, the pigeon took flight and flew off with a flutter.Soaring, the pigeon dashed out of the Song Family\u2019s main yard, nimbly flitting over crimson roof tiles. Then, it swooped down above various small streets, navigated across the undulating black roofs of buildings, and soon reached Cypress Pine Lake. From there, it headed towards a red pleasure boat where it landed.At the window of one of the chambers on the pleasure boat, the black pigeon came to a stop with a flop. A fair and delicate hand gently reached out to cradle it.Jun\u2019er quickly removed the rolled note tied to the black pigeon\u2019s leg. Then, glancing around furtively, she promptly let it fly off.\u201cGo, return to your nest,\u201d she lightly instructed.The black pigeon shook its wings and flew away. Soon, it vanished from the window\u2019s edge.Jun\u2019er closed the window. Gently, she unrolled the note, whereupon a look of tenderness instantly appeared on her face. Then, she swiftly lifted the note to the candle flame to burn.Holding it in her hand, she waited for the paper to burn till nothing but a small corner was left. Only then did she open the window a crack to throw it outside, leaving it to float freely on Cypress Pine Lake.\u201cCreak\u2026\u201dSuddenly, the door of the room opened of its own accord, as if someone was pushing on it from outside. Jun\u2019er was stunned. She spun around all of a sudden, her nerves a wreck as she pressed onto her wildly thumping chest. She glared intently at the door.When she was more settled, she walked over. She looked to the left and right, but did not see a single soul. Then, she stuck her head out into the corridor and took a look.This place was the make-up room beneath the hold of the ship. Because of Song Zhenguo, she now enjoyed a make-up room all by herself. There weren\u2019t any others around; the other ladies had all gone upstairs to entertain guests.Not a single soul could be seen along the deserted corridor.Heaving a soft sigh in relief, Jun\u2019er returned to her room. She locked her door and even added a horizontal beam across it.She went to the dressing table, where she began to gently comb her hair. Whenever her emotions were in chaos, combing her hair would always gradually calm her down.Yet, as she picked up the comb, her expression distorted.Shockingly, there was a line of words written in black eyebrow pencil on the surface of wooden table.\u2018You have to act during Scented Satin Festival. Don\u2019t forget who you are.\u2019Biting her lips, a conflicted look rose in Jun\u2019er\u2019s eyes. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, she used an eyebrow pencil to write \u2018Yes\u2019. Then, she reached out to rub away any trace of the words, leaving behind only a blotch of black.Raising her head, she looked into the copper mirror and saw her own fuzzy reflection. In that moment, she fell into a daze.She knew that it was a warning: a warning for her not to do anything other than what she was supposed to do. Still, it was a relief that the contents of the rolled note had not been discovered.\u2018Pity\u2026 I can\u2019t be with Brother Song anymore\u2026\u2019 A trace of regret and resoluteness flashed through her captivating eyes.Master wanted to gather those who were born at a Yin hour\u2013those born in a Yin year, Yin month and Yin hour. Song Zhenguo was precisely one such target. In order to capture him, all preparations had been made. The only thing left was for her to invite him over for Scented Satin Festival. [1]Yet, unknowingly, she had fallen for the gentlemanly and upright Song Zhenguo. She worshiped him, admired him, and wished to rely and depend on him\u2026\u2018Brother Song\u2026 Jun\u2019er is really tired\u2026 really tired\u2026\u2019 Jun\u2019er lightly caressed her cheeks. A tear flowed down soundlessly from the corner of her eye.***In a little valley outside the city.\u201cBAM!!!\u201dSpinning around, Lu Sheng landed a palm strike. With a loud bang, the thick boulder behind him broke and shattered into small pieces. An arm\u2019s width of rock was crushed into four, five pieces, now scattered on the ground.\u201cBang, bang, bang!\u201dThen, Lu Sheng swung around violently. One by one, he smashed the other rocks nearby into bits.Grayish white stone powder flew into the sky, which made it somewhat irritable to breathe in.Unhurriedly, Lu Sheng called it a day. Clasping both palms together, he sank his dantian and stood still. [2]\u2018I have more than enough saber and palm skills, what I lack is qinggong movement skills, I also need to develop long-distance covert attacks. Otherwise, it\u2019ll be problematic if I fight over a long distance with opponents who specialize in ranged attacks,\u2019 Lu Sheng took his time to stabilize his inner force, all the while inwardly deliberating over the matter.\u2018Besides, after absorbing the force generation technique of Black Tiger Saber, the upgrade quality for Jade Crane Skill has changed. But, this type of upgrade depends on that powder left behind by the ghost.As for the integration process and all its details, it would require far too much experience and fumbling if I were to do it all by myself. This is as difficult as creating a martial art, which is impossible for one man to easily accomplish.\u2019All this while, he had been trying to experience a breakthrough in his other inner and outer force skills by himself. Yet, it was still regrettably unsuccessful, ending with him suffering injuries to his meridians each time. Moreover, as he tried time and again, the resultant effect of each attempt was completely beyond what he predicted.\u2018Without sufficient martial arts experience, looks like it\u2019s impossible for me to break through the skills\u2019 limits by my own efforts alone,\u2019 Lu Sheng understood that well and clear. \u2018On the surface, it seems simple for Jade Crane Skill to absorb the force generation technique of Black Tiger Saber and change itself fundamentally. In reality, it is probably the best result eventually attained from countless rounds of simulations made beforehand. If I want to continue to upgrade martial arts, then I need to find much more of that stuff left behind by ghosts.\u2019After wrapping things up, Lu Sheng walked to a large tree nearby, where he had hung his outer coat, towel and the like on a branch. He used the towel to wipe off his perspiration.\u2018I should test out the strength of the third level of Black Fury Skill.\u2019 All this while, he had not gone all-out to test exactly how powerful the third level of Black Fury Skill was. Now that his body was fully restored, it was just the right time to give it a try.Looking at the big tree in front of him, Lu Sheng was roused. Agitating his inner Qi at full force, it flooded into his right hand, which he lashed out in a brutal strike.\u201cBAM!\u201dThe sound produced was somewhat like the previous ones. The force of the strength did not increase much. After all, explosive strength was not the primary area of amplification for Black Fury Skill.Lu Sheng gently withdrew his hand. Smack in the middle of the tree trunk, he could see the distinct print of a palm, as black as ink.The palm print was more than ten millimeters deep. The entire thing gave off a pungent stench that was an assault on one\u2019s olfactory sense.Reaching out his hand, Lu Sheng carefully touched the edges of the blackened hand print. A big piece of tree bark immediately fell to the ground. Within the tree bark, massive amounts of black veined patterns could be seen, akin to wrinkles.\u2018This seems almost like it\u2019s been scalded by fire. Seems like Black Fury Skill should be in the top tier among those inner force skills of the Yang nature. Pity that there are only these few incomplete levels\u2026 if Black Fury Skill can be extrapolated and strengthened, perhaps future upgrades and progress will be tremendous!\u2019He currently possessed profound skills equivalent to the average person\u2019s forty or fifty years\u2019 cultivation. This was not even considering the time spent on training Black Tiger Saber Technique and other martial arts.\u2018Next, I should cultivate a specialized movement skill. Be it Black Tiger Saber or the other martial arts, they only have movement skills that are compatible with attacking. But I don\u2019t have any complete system of movement skills dedicated purely to giving chase, fleeing, or hastening on the journey.\u2019Lu Sheng began to browse through the movement skills in his collection. Up to now, he had only gathered one such skill, which was Precious Eight Steps he had acquired back in Nine Links City. However, it was mainly for the purpose of dodging and evading during a battle.\u2018Deep Blue,\u2019 he called out silently in his mind.The square frame of the Modifier surfaced and floated before his eyes.Lu Sheng recalled Precious Eight Steps from what he had previously committed to memory. The quality of this movement skill was on a lower tier than even Pursuing the Wind Blade. It did not even have a diagram for mediation. Thus, he had simply memorized it in its entirety.Thinking back in detail to each of the steps, Lu Sheng unhurriedly extended his left feet. Then, he rotated his calf muscles to the left and exerted strength. With his right leg pointing at one of the side tree branches, he borrowed strength to suddenly propel his entire person forward. This was the first step of Precious Eight Steps, which comprised a total of eight steps across three levels.Apparently, it was modeled after the once-renowned Cricket-Catching in Eight Steps of Central Plains.Given his original foundation in movement skills, after analyzing it for a moment, Lu Sheng was soon very familiar with the actions and force required. He looked at the Precious Eight Steps selection within the Modifier.He promptly ceased all activity and, with a thought, pressed onto the \u2018Modify\u2019 button.In that moment, the entire Modifier frame flashed violently.\u2018Upgrade Precious Eight Steps by one level,\u2019 Lu Sheng continued.Within the Modifier selection, the state of Precious Eight Steps progressed from \u2018Uninitiated\u2019 to \u2018Initiated\u2019 in the blink of an eye.Lu Sheng felt out the state of his body. Other than a mild sensation of numbing itch in both his legs and a slight reduction in the Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill inner Qi, there wasn\u2019t any other effect.\u2018Unbeknownst to myself, I have already accumulated Qi to such an extent\u2026 such low-end pugilistic martial arts aren\u2019t a burden on my body anymore,\u2019 Lu Sheng exclaimed as he continued to gaze at the Modifier frame.\u2018Precious Eight Steps: Initiated.\u2019\u2018Upgrade Precious Eight Steps to the highest\u2013third\u2013level,\u2019 Lu Sheng commanded resolutely in his mind.\u201cSwoosh!\u201dPrecious Eight Steps flashed brilliantly for a moment, changing from \u2018Initiated\u2019 to \u2018Level One\u2019. Lu Sheng didn\u2019t seem to feel a thing.\u201cSwoosh!\u201dIn this second level, Lu Sheng felt an even stronger itch in his legs.In the last swoosh, Precious Eight Steps jumped straight to the third level, consuming four-fifths of the amount of Black Tiger Jade Crane inner Qi he had available. It would require at least two days to replenish such an amount.However, Lu Sheng could sense in his mind the absolute mastery and comprehensive study of the entire movement skill\u2019s experience, step moves and methods. Both his legs were also evidently stronger and more nimble than before.\u2018Let\u2019s try it out!\u2019Lu Sheng could detect a sparrow within his line of sight in front. It was flying up from the ground with a flutter and just about to shoot off into the distance.Exerting strength beneath his feet, he charged forward in a flash.\u201cPutt-putt-putt\u2026\u201dHe pursued urgently in eight consecutive strides. That little bird was barely able to make a turn to escape before Lu Sheng caught it in a single grab.\u2018I have great explosive might. Both Black Fury Skill inner Qi and Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill have increased my explosive power and also strengthened my body. Unleashing Precious Eight Steps with such a foundation has produced quite an impressive result. This should be about the speed of Cricket-Catching in Eight Steps?\u2019 Satisfied, Lu Sheng loosened his grip. Inside was the little sparrow he had crushed to a pulp of bloodied flesh.It wasn\u2019t long before he felt helpless again.\u2018Now that the issue of movement skill is solved, it\u2019s time to find some hard skills to try out,\u2019 Lu Sheng considered the matter. In these few months he had been in Mountain-Edge City, he had also secretly enquired about the situation within the city.There weren\u2019t many experts in Mountain Edge City. Because the government authorities held strong sway over the place, there were many regulations in place for pugilists. Therefore, many of the experts turned out to be government officials or military commanders.Among them, the most illustrious was Lu Chengzhong, the One-Qi Green Peak Sword\u2013all the others paled in comparison. However, Lu Chengzhong was already eighty-seven years old, with three sons who were all high-ranking officials within the city. Consequently, he was very hard to get to for advice.He was the first whom Lu Sheng eliminated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Kurisu\u2018Then I guess it\u2019s those official martial arts dojos that take in disciples. The second option is the famed expert from Central Plains\u2013Li Ran, the Soul-Slaying Palm,\u2019 Lu Sheng had done his homework on this man. His meridians had been injured by his foe in the Central Plains. As a last resort, he brought his wife and children here to Mountain-Edge City to live as a hermit, away from trouble.\u2018Despite being wounded, he\u2019s still made a name for himself in Mountain-Edge City. He must have a trick or two up his sleeves. And his palm technique is pretty similar to mine. He\u2019s worth checking out.Additionally, as for hard body skills, there\u2019re two to check out\u2013Chen Jia, the Tumbler, and Yang Furui, the Bronze Pillar.\u2019Lu Sheng had personally visited the martial arts dojos opened by the two of them. The Tumbler was in his seventies and the craft he imparted was merely very ordinary skills. Bronze Pillar Yang Furui, on the other hand, was much more open-handed. As long as you paid the fee, you could learn the foundational hard body skill\u2013Tempered Steel Skill. After that, depending on your performance, you would have the chance to be selected as his personal disciple and have him impart you the Bronze Pillar Skill. [1]\u2018Enrolling in a martial arts dojo as a student is too slow for me. I only need the manuals. As long as I can get inside and obtain the manual\u2026\u2019 He gave it some thought and decided to first check out the auction in the city. Perhaps he would be able to find some powerful skill like Black Fury Skill.Thinking of the auction, he suddenly felt in his waist pouch for the few thin pieces of silver notes and golden leaves. He sighed.\u2018I\u2019ve got to find a way to earn some money.\u2019If not for the Wang Ziquan incident\u2026 if not for his encounter with the pleasure boat Scarlet Decks, he wouldn\u2019t be in such a hurry to upgrade his strength.Having packed his luggage, Lu Sheng ran along the main path leading back into Mountain-Edge City. He had made up his mind to go check out the famed expert from the Central Plains\u2013Soul-Slaying Palm Li Ran.Hailing a horse carriage, Lu Sheng allowed himself to be carried all over within the city. After the time several times longer than the what it took to brew a pot of tea, he reached his goal.At the end of the street was a historic, vintage manor, embellished with many peach tree wooden signboards. That was the renowned Greenwood Dao Court\u2013the martial arts dojo opened by Li Ran, the Soul-Slaying Palm.It just so happened that the main door was open. It was the time of the day when the Dao Court was open for public visiting.Lu Sheng joined the cacophonous throng, following it into the manor. Inside was a massive square arena, supported by red pillars.On the arena, a middle-aged man with a white beard was executing a continuous series of palm strikes, his posture as imposing as a fierce tiger. Every now and then, his palms would roar as they struck into the air.\u201cBravo!\u201dHe had just reached an exciting point in the set of palm movements. The throng below was thrown into ecstasy and called out in exclamations and praises.Lu Sheng fixed his eyes on the arena.\u2018That\u2019s the standard of a famed expert from the Central Plains?\u2019He didn\u2019t dare to believe his eyes. To be fair, this man\u2019s palm technique wasn\u2019t too shabby; he had good control of his speed and precision. But there was a thread of hesitation at the moment between moves. Moreover, his strikes were clearly wanting in strength and were weak in force. Even the roaring sounds were a hoax produced by technique to make up for his lack in strength.What really left Lu Sheng speechless was when he heard someone beside him exclaim, \u201cYesterday, Grandmaster Li issued a challenge to all pugilists in Mountain-Edge City to duel him on the arena. Even the Second Commander of the Winged Honor Guard was alerted and came to duel with Grandmaster Li. If only you guys had seen it! Within thirty moves, the Second Commander was struck squarely on his chest by the palm, retreated several steps and clasped his hands to admit defeat!\u201d\u201cImpressive! He truly lives up to his name as a famed expert of the Central Plains! Out of this world!\u201d\u201cWhat does that count as? Previously, Grandmaster Li had even continuously defeated the Dojo Masters of Bronze Pillar Dao Court, Mad Lion Dao Court, Misty Cloud Dao Court, Nine Tunes Heaven and Earth Dao Court\u2026\u201d another boasted. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it all myself. Not one among them could last fifty moves with Grandmaster Li!\u201dImmediately, the crowd burst forth in a series of exclamations.Lu Sheng could tell that they weren\u2019t being patronizing; they were truly impressed from the heart.He looked closely again at Li Ran, who was demonstrating his palm technique on the arena. Somebody had taken up his challenge and stepped onto the arena. Perhaps \u201ctaking up his challenge\u201d was a stretch\u2013it was more of \u201cgiving it a try\u201d.The lad on the arena was fit and muscular, yet remained highly respectful towards Li Ran and only asked that Grandmaster Li would show him a few pointers.The two of them quickly got into an intense and lively duel.In just a few glances, Lu Sheng understood why Li Ran was so admired.\u2018So it turns out that Li Ran\u2019s strength and speed is already a level to be reckoned with among ordinary men\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng realized only after seeing the lad\u2019s moves. Previously, having neither a point of reference nor the opportunity to duel with other experts, Lu Sheng actually had no idea what level his own strength had arrived at. All along, he had hidden his strength well and cultivated all by himself; thus, he had only been able to guess at how strong he was.\u2018Now it seems\u2026 this Li Ran\u2026 I can defeat him in three moves,\u2019 Lu Sheng shook his head, turned around and walked out of the throng without watching any further.\u2018His Soul-Slaying Palm is only barely more forceful than my Heart-Shattering Palm. Without me activating any inner force, perhaps he can be my match. But once I use inner force\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng thought about it further. Perhaps \u201cthree moves\u201d was overestimating him.One move. That\u2019s all it would take to finish him off.When he used his inner force, his might was several times that of when he did not.\u2018What I need aren\u2019t such supposed \u201cexperts\u201d,\u2019 Lu Sheng left the Greenwood Dao Court. He had intended to visit the Bronze Pillar Dao Court; but since it was getting late, he decided to go back to rest first.The next day, Lu Sheng went to the Bronze Pillar Dao Court as well as a few other Dao Courts.He watched the hard body skill performance as planned. The legendary Bronze Pillar Skill would train one to bend a spear against one\u2019s throat. It seemed pretty impressive indeed. But Lu Sheng had seen such hard body skills before in the past\u2013they were merely a form of hard inner force. The practice method was very basic\u2013you just needed to endure pain and persist in it.Furthermore, cultivating the hard body skill, Bronze Pillar Skill, required copious amounts of medicinal herbs to temper one\u2019s body. Otherwise, it would leave many latent aftereffects on the body. These hard body skill Dao Courts were generous with their skill techniques; they released them to the public directly. But not a single word of the recipe for their medicinal solution was revealed.Lu Sheng did some digging around and learned that only members of the Dao Courts got to enjoy the use of the body-tempering medicinal solutions.This left him disappointed. Without the recipe, even if he successfully practiced the skill, he would land up with a body full of wounds. Although the Modifier may work differently from usual training, he did not want to waste time experimenting. Just the breakthrough in Black Fury Skill to Level Three alone kept him on his bed for half a year. If it happened again, wouldn\u2019t he be left handicapped for a good few years?By the time he left the Dao Court, half a day had passed.Lu Sheng didn\u2019t have much to show for his half a day of labor. Disappointed, he came to the famed Ghost Market at the First Street in Mountain-Edge City.The Ghost Market in Mountain-Edge City was a place that specialized in dealing in all sorts of burial items, black market items, stolen items and other items of suspicious backgrounds.Lu Sheng sorted out his entire wealth; he was left with silver notes and golden leaves worth about two thousand taels in total. The stationery store under his name earned him less than a hundred taels each month; that kind of money wasn\u2019t good for anything to him.\u2018Let me take a look around and see if I can pick out any gems,\u2019 he had come here because he had heard from Zheng Xiangui that many of the good things that they had auctioned off had been discovered in the Ghost Market.From then on, he often came to hang around and try his luck in Mountain-Edge City\u2019s Ghost Market.Not many people frequented the Ghost Market. It comprised of merely over ten stalls cramped into a narrow alley.Lu Sheng walked along the alley, stooping every now and then to touch something that was on display in the stall.After shopping for a while, he still found no gains and was about to head back to cultivate inner Qi. Suddenly, a hesitant male voice rang out from the opposite end of the alley.\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 Lu Sheng\u2026 Lu Yue Sheng?\u201dLu Sheng raised his head and looked. It was a young master with a tall and straight posture, dressed in yellow garment with a piece of yellow jade on his waist. Though Lu Sheng did not know him, he recognized the identity of this person in a single glance.\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 Chen Yunxi\u2019s elder brother? Chen Jiaorong?\u201dChen Jiaorong was surprised, then smiled. \u201cBrother Lu\u2019s eyes are sharp indeed.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with my eyes. You and your sister just resemble each other too much\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head.Compared with Chen Yunxi, Chen Jiaorong\u2019s facial features were just slightly more masculine. Both of them truly looked as if they were made of the same mold.\u201cSince I\u2019ve bumped into Brother Lu here, why don\u2019t we go get a drink? Zhenguo often mentions you to me,\u201d Chen Jiaorong laughed as he suggested.Lu Sheng agreed with a nod of his head.The two of them exited the Ghost Market, found a winery nearby and sat down for a few drinks.The hall was filled with people milling about. The waiters yelled as they served wine and the customers incessantly broke out in laughter. But neither of them were disturbed. They sat in silence for a while.\u201cI\u2019ve heard from Yunxi that Brother Lu is a man of admirable character. I\u2019ve underestimated Brother Lu previously,\u201d Chen Jiaorong broke the silence first. Pausing, he added, \u201cThe authorities have stepped in to handle Wang Ziquan\u2019s matter. It wasn\u2019t Brother Zhenguo who filed the case, but rather, his cousin and family members.\u201dLu Sheng held the wine cup and sipped lightly, allowing the refreshing and piquant wine to flow slowly into his mouth. \u201cLet\u2019s put aside Yunxi\u2019s matter for the time being. What do the yamen authorities say?\u201dChen Jiaorong shook his head, \u201cZhenguo has also asked me to inquire into it. The verdict is that he slipped and fell into the water. That\u2019s also the conclusion of the Senior Constable who\u2019s been investigating the case. Supposedly, someone even saw him fall into Cypress Pine Lake. We have both testimonial and material evidence.\u201dLu Sheng kept silent. He drank to the bottom of his cup in a tilt of his head. \u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d\u201cYea\u2026 what else can we do?\u201d Chen Jiaorong said helplessly. \u201cTo be honest, there\u2019s always been many cases of people going missing at Cypress Pine Lake every year. People like Wang Ziquan are many. That\u2019s how the authorities have always been handling such cases. And they don\u2019t even allow us to publicize such incidents, or else we\u2019ll get arrested and thrown into jail.\u201dNow Lu Sheng suddenly realized how Mountain-Edge City earned its reputation of good security.\u201cMy sister says the reason you turned her down was that both of you don\u2019t know each other well enough yet,\u201d Chen Jiaorong changed the topic.\u201cSo we\u2019re just leaving it as that for Wang Ziquan\u2019s matter?\u201d Lu Sheng persisted.\u201cYes, we\u2019re leaving it as that,\u201d Chen Jiaorong replied. \u201cCypress Pine Lake is huge. Don\u2019t tell me that you expect people to dive in one by one to find a corpse that, in all likelihood, has already been eaten by fish?\u201dLu Sheng sighed and straightened his body. He was feeling rather upset. Whether in Nine Links City or Mountain-Edge City, the deliberate callousness and apathy of the authorities left him extremely frustrated.\u201cThen what\u2019s the use of the authorities?\u201d An exclamation burst out from his lips.Stunned, Chen Jiaorong subconsciously pressed on the piece of yellow jade on his waist.\u201cYea\u2026 what on earth is the use of the authorities?\u201dIn that moment, both of their moods turned sour as different things came to each of their minds.Silence.Unbeknownst to himself, Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze had fallen on the yellow jade in Chen Jiaorong\u2019s hand. His eyelids twitched.\u201cBrother Chen, can you let me take a look at that piece of jade?\u201dChen Jiaorong nodded and passed the jade over to Lu Sheng. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift from one of my closest friends a while back. It\u2019s high quality Nine Plains Jade.\u201dAt the moment when the jade fell into Lu Sheng\u2019s hand, he felt a piercing coldness shooting into his body from within the jade.That coldness was exactly the same one he felt when he absorbed the powder previously.\u2018What thick Yin Qi!\u2019 Lu Sheng\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He had termed such a form of Qi as Yin Qi. Presently, the density of the Yin Qi within this jade was many times that of what he had gotten out of the powder, to the extent that he could absorb much of it just by direct skin contact alone, without shedding a drop of blood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You still haven\u2019t given me a reply. Like my sister asked, how well must both of you know each other to be considered well enough?\u201d He again shifted the topic of conversation back to the matter of his sister\u2019s marriage.Lu Sheng had evaded it once earlier. Now that he was being asked again, he immediately sighed.\u201cSuch matters can\u2019t be rushed. Brother Chen, you\u2019ll find out in due time. Moreover, I\u2019ve only known Yunxi for such a short period\u2026 does your family really trusts me that much?\u201d\u201cYou know, originally, I had my reservations. But because of what you\u2019ve just said, I can really put my mind at ease now.\u201d Smiling, he added, \u201cIf you agree to this, we can double the dowry!\u201dLu Sheng smiled bitterly.He knew that, on one hand, Chen Yunxi genuinely fancied him. On the other hand, the Chen family had been fretting over their unwed, unwanted daughter all this while. Now that a match has been painstakingly found, they weren\u2019t going to let go no matter what.\u201cLet\u2019s talk about this in the future. At least, wait for me to achieve an academic degree, then we\u2019ll talk about this,\u201d Lu Sheng broached the subject of the Annual Examinations as an excuse.Hearing this, Chen Jiaorong\u2019s eyes shone with even deeper admiration. After all, their offer was extremely tempting\u2013just a nod would guarantee instant acquisition of immeasurable wealth! If he were in Lu Sheng\u2019s shoes, he would definitely have jumped at the chance without hesitation. Besides, after getting married, he could still find and marry many other wives and concubines. Even though his sister Chen Yunxi\u2019s long legs were a physical defect that put her in the same category as disfigured women, she still had some redeeming qualities after all.\u201cIn that case, it\u2019s set. Brother Lu, you can make the decision after your Annual Examinations. Yunxi is no longer young; she\u2019s at a marriageable age now\u2026 I truly hope that Brother Lu won\u2019t delay.\u201dHelpless, Lu Sheng could only nod. Both of them left the winery and split up. Seeing that it was already late, he turned to return home.After a night\u2019s rest, he headed again to the Institution the next day. Just as he seated himself, the sounds of a commotion could be heard from outside.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on outside?\u201d Lu Sheng looked at Song Zhenguo next to him, currently packing his scrolls.Song Zhenguo\u2019s face clouded over. He whispered in a low voice, \u201cWang Ziquan\u2019s family members are here.\u201dLu Sheng saw that many people in the study hall rose to gather at the window and entrance, taking a look. The faint cries of women and children could be heard drifting from outside.He stood up. He could hear many students sighing.\u201cZiquan seems to have gone missing\u2026 there\u2019s a young woman with two children from his family who are here. I heard that his old man went to report to the officials for help, but got a harsh beating by the yamen authorities. He\u2019s suffered grave injuries and been bedridden at home since. Ai\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy would the yamen authorities beat him up?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because his old man refused to believe that his son had drowned. He knelt in front of the yamen entrance and wouldn\u2019t get up. Who would know that the newly appointed Chief Constable loathes such insubordinate civilians the most\u2026\u201d\u201cThe widow and orphans are most pitiful\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s really pitiful\u2026 from the looks of it, his old man won\u2019t make it too\u2026\u201dThe more he heard, the more Lu Sheng felt disgusted. Wang Ziquan had come from a merchant family. Although their business was not flourishing, they were somewhat well off. Yet now, his family was broken apart by death.Song Zhenguo could also hear the chatter in the surroundings. Shoving his way through the crowd, he stood next to Lu Sheng.\u201cIt\u2019s my fault. If I hadn\u2019t asked him to go out that day\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t overthink it, it\u2019s got nothing to do with you,\u201d Lu Sheng patted his shoulders. However, Song Zhenguo\u2019s expression remained overcast as he kept silent.Both of them walked out of the study hall, one in front of the other. They saw a pretty, young woman, apparently around eighteen or nineteen years of age. She had two young children in tow, both barely one or two year old. They knelt by the only path that led to the Institution, heads bowed, covered in white funeral clothing.The throng of bystanders now numbered in the tens, and seemed to be growing bigger by the second.\u201cCome, let\u2019s go take a look,\u201d Lu Sheng nudged at Song Zhenguo. He took the lead to walk over.\u201cNo need! I\u2019ll go alone. This is my fault! I\u2019ll go alone!\u201d Song Zhenguo pulled him back in a grip and said somberly.Lu Sheng was stunned. He didn\u2019t even have the time to respond before Song Zhenguo quickly strode forward and stood in front of the young woman. He then started to converse with her in hushed tone.Two teachers from the Institution also jostled their way into the crowd of students, enquiring about the matter. Very soon, Song Zhenguo promptly supported the young woman and children out of the Institution.Lu Sheng followed closely behind. He also left the Institution as he caught up with both of them.He barely went forward a few steps to catch up to them before he saw a yamen official heading in their direction. After speaking a bit with Song Zhenguo and the young woman, the few of them swiftly boarded a horse carriage and left.As they pulled away, Song Zhenguo even gestured to Lu Sheng that he needn\u2019t follow, instead urging him to get back to class.\u201cDon\u2019t delay your preparation for the Annual Examinations, go back! I\u2019ll settle this!\u201d Song Zhenguo hollered at Lu Sheng from a distance ahead, before boarding the carriage to leave as well.Lu Sheng followed the departing black carriage with red patterns with his gaze. It was clear that that was the same model specially reserved for use by the yamen authorities.He stood at the entrance of the Institution for a while longer. In the end, he turned around and headed back to continue attending the lesson.The matter of Wang Ziquan\u2019s family circulated around in the Institution for a period of time, but it was soon quelled. Oftentimes, Lu Sheng would find some government officials coming over to speak with a few of the academics in the Institution. Perhaps it was because of their pressure that talk of the matter was suppressed. As for Wang Ziquan\u2019s family, no one else came to make any trouble.Ever since Song Zhenguo made that trip that day, his face seemed more at ease and relieved. Likely, he had given some sort of compensation to Wang Ziquan\u2019s family.The missing person case calmed down very quickly after the initial uproar. Once the storm died down, the Institution returned to normal, as if the entire incident had never happened.***The Song Family.Song Zhenguo chewed silently on the food brought over by the servant girl. A sumptuous feast of chicken, duck, fish and goose lay on the table, but he had no appetite. There was something weighing on his mind.From outside his room, he could hear the faint footsteps and voice of his old man. However, he did not go out to greet him, remaining rooted in his seat instead. He heaved a long sigh.They were one of the families which moved to the Mountain-Edge City. His old man had just started his business and was unusually busy. His temper was already poor; now with his stall business added to the equation, he was especially cantankerous.\u201cWhy can\u2019t Father just see the good in Jun\u2019er? If she marries into the family, there\u2019ll definitely be peace in the family and I\u2019ll have a successful career in the future. With Jun\u2019er\u2019s help and a stable family, I\u2019ll certainly accomplish a name for myself in the Annual Examinations\u2026\u201d Song Zhenguo heaved a long inward sigh.\u201cFlip-flap, flip-flap.\u201dIn the midst of mealtime, a black pigeon suddenly appeared again at the window. It glared at him with a pair of pink eyes.\u201cCuckoo, cuckoo. \u201dThe pigeon called out twice.Seeing that, Song Zhenguo\u2019s face instantly beamed with delight.Making his way over in a few steps, he hurriedly grabbed the pigeon and removed a rolled-up note from its leg. He quickly opened it.\u2018You don\u2019t need to worry anymore about what Jun\u2019er said previously. After I threatened the boat master with my own life, he finally relented. The plan is for Elder Brother Song to come tomorrow during the festival with ten thousand taels of silver to redeem Jun\u2019er. Elder Brother Song, you don\u2019t need to worry. Although ten thousand taels is a lot, Jun\u2019er has also accumulated quite a bit in these few years; I can make up for at least half of that.Tomorrow night, Elder Brother Song must promise to come alone. Jun\u2019er will offer my body and my everything entirely to Elder Brother. Hope you\u2026 cherish it\u2026\u2019After he finished reading, Song Zhenguo felt an insuppressible ecstasy bursting forth from the depths of his heart, which surged up all the way to his head. His face soon flushed bright red. He stood up and paced back and forth in his room, clutching the roll of paper in his hand.\u201cJun\u2019er\u2026 Jun\u2019er\u2026 you are MINE! I will definitely bring you out of that pleasure boat, and leave that god-damned place. I\u2019ll give you a status!\u201d He muttered under his breath, his fists clenched tightly. Yet, he had entirely forgotten about Little Jun\u2019s previous reminder\u2013to not visit the pleasure boat during the Scented Satin Festival under any circumstances.Song Zhenguo was worked up for a moment before gradually calming down.\u2018But didn\u2019t Jun\u2019er also previously say not to visit the pleasure boat during Scented Satin Festival? Lest I fall into a scam?\u2019He pondered over the matter. His expression slowly returned to normal as he stood there hesitating for a moment.\u2018I\u2019ll ask Jun\u2019er why she didn\u2019t want me to visit the pleasure boat during Scented Satin Festival when I see her. Maybe there were some extenuating circumstances.\u2019His heart bursting with joy, Song Zhenguo started to prepare the silver notes. Ten thousand taels of silver was a large sum even to him. The funds he had accumulated over the years had all been depleted in this period by his expenditure on Jun\u2019er. For him to amass such a huge sum all of a sudden posed some difficulty. Although Jun\u2019er had said that she\u2019d make up for half of it on her side, he wasn\u2019t the type of man to let his woman shoulder such a burden!\u2018Heck it, I\u2019ll go find Elder Sis to borrow some for now,\u2019 leaving his food unfinished, he hurriedly scrambled to the entrance on his way out.\u2018Such a happy occasion! Although Jun\u2019er is shy and wants me to go alone, it\u2019s such a joyous occasion! I have to share this with a couple of close friends for them to share in our blessings,\u2019 Song Zhenguo again hurried back to his study desk. He prepared the ink and was about to raise his brush to write letters to his only two close friends.But just as he prepared the brush and ink, he hesitated and lay down his brush.\u2018Forget it, it\u2019s best that I go alone. The more people there are, the more variables and greater the likelihood that something goes awry. It\u2019s not too late to inform the others after things are settled.\u2019Hurrying on his way, he found his Elder Sis. He borrowed fifteen thousand taels of silver notes, which he said he needed as capital to do his own business. Very quickly, all preparations were made.***The Annual Examinations were getting nearer and nearer. Lu Sheng\u2019s family had sent Qiao\u2019er over, along with a thousand taels of silver to supplement his recent expenditure. [1]However, Lu Sheng knew very well that his family was already selling away all sorts of properties and shops to prepare to relocate. Because of that huge explosion in Nine Links City a while ago, there were many people looking to relocate. As a result, the price for shops and property had depreciated greatly. Moreover, when the family needed to purchase other properties in the near future, that would also require plentiful funds.Therefore, those one thousand taels were probably the last bit of money his family had on hand. After all, the Lu Family was currently in a stormy season.After the waves had died down, Wang Ziquan\u2019s incident also slowly sank to the back of Lu Sheng\u2019s mind. He began to concentrate on upgrading himself, and was even sourcing for ways to earn a few bucks.\u201cIn the northern mountains there\u2019re springs, oh! In the red canals there\u2019re yellow tulips! Out of White Sand Town there\u2019re sparrows all over, oh! On Xin Zhao River turmeric flows!\u201d\u201cAh, Mountain-Edge City! My hometown ~~~~ Ah, Mountain-Edge City! My hometown ~~~~Lalalala~~lalalalalala~~~~\u2026.\u201d\u201cLalalala~~lalalalalala~~~!\u201d\u201cLalalala~~lalalalalala~~~!\u201dLu Sheng stood expressionless by the window, listening to the unbearable, high-pitched male voice.He was woken up around three a.m. in the dead of the night, which also meant that his sleep was disturbed in the Yan hour. Then, he saw these groups passing by outside, without a break between them, all singing song after song. Some voices were high-pitched, others were low and hoarse. They passed by the street, seemingly without end.Presently, a long line of people was blowing on the oboe and singing at the top of their voices. Dressed in red and blue garments, they were mostly aunties and uncles who were beating on their drums, pounding on their gongs, and yelling their chants. This was the warm-up folk song before Scented Satin Festival proper that was heading slowly but surely in the direction of the city center.What really left Lu Sheng dumbfounded was that members of the public had gathered by the sides of the streets to soak in the atmosphere, not finding it bothersome in the least. Instead, they followed the groups in great earnestness, some even joining in the singing. There were even yamen officials who had been dispatched there to maintain order.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Rubbing her eyes, she placed a large plate of custard fritters on the table. \u201cYour breakfast is here. The small-grain porridge is still boiling, and there\u2019re no buns today, only custard fritters.\u201d\u201cWell, custard fritters are the sweets eaten here during festivals,\u201d Lu Sheng shut the windows tight and turned around to look at Little Qiao.He had not seen this girl for just a few months, and yet she was growing prettier by the day. Especially her chest, which was filling up nicely. Though her dress was clearly not designed to be low-cut, it was being stretched taut by her. Looking downwards from the top, one could clearly see two fair mounds and a deep canal\u2026\u201cAhh! Young Master, you have naughty eyes!\u201d Little Qiao pouted and covered her chest with her hand. \u201cQiao\u2019er only just realized that the clothes I\u2019ve brought with me are all too small. Recently my body\u2019s been growing real fast\u2026\u201dLu Sheng chuckled, \u201cI\u2019ll take you shopping for clothes a little later.\u201dLittle Qiao\u2019s face scrunched up.\u201cWe better not\u2026 The family\u2019s finances are no longer as before. Even the money for Young Master\u2019s medicine is running out. There\u2019re so many things that need spending on\u2026\u201dLu Sheng was caught by surprise. Instantly, he felt somewhat ashamed. The family was already on their uppers, to the point where even Little Qiao was sensible enough to tighten her belt, while he himself remained in the dark.Ever since she came over, Qiao\u2019er had been living in one of the rooms in this house. As his personal maid, she was after all going to end up in bed with him sooner or later. As long as Lu Sheng was willing to give her an identity as his concubine in the future, she would have struck her pot of gold.Qiao\u2019er came from a troubled family; her father was a gambler who had once, in a frenzy, put his wife and daughter up as stakes and landed up losing both of them. Little Qiao and her mother were almost sold to the brothel. In the end, they were both redeemed by the kind-hearted Second Mother, Liu Cuiyu, who cleared their debts for them.Even then, however, Little Qiao\u2019s mother was still bedridden by the trauma of the turn of events. Not long later, she breathed her last, leaving Qiao\u2019er behind alone in the Lu Manor. Now, the Lu Family was Qiao\u2019er\u2019s home.\u2018Got to find a way to earn some cash\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng began to view this as a matter of utmost priority.He turned around and saw Qiao\u2019er retrieve a letter from her chest.\u201cThere was a messenger earlier who delivered a letter,\u201d Qiao\u2019er placed the letter on the table.Lu Sheng walked over, picked up two custard fritters with a pair of chopsticks and put them into his mouth. Then, he picked up the letter. The mark on the letter indicated that it had come from the Lu Family.\u201cIt\u2019s a message from home,\u201d he tore open the envelope and took out the letter within.The main gist of the letter was that the family had decided to migrate to Mountain-Edge City and that Lu Sheng should not worry\u2013everything was going smoothly and he should focus on preparing for his Annual Examinations.Having read the letter, Lu Sheng shook his head and kept it in his drawer.\u201cIs the medicine for today ready?\u201d He asked Little Qiao. At the same time, he wolfed down the pile of custard fritters. More than twenty of them, each the size of a palm, vanished into his mouth in a few blinks of the eye.\u201cYes, it\u2019s ready, in the medicinal box. Young Master can go ahead and practice martial arts. Do leave and return early,\u201d Little Qiao knew that the time Lu Sheng\u2019s daily training was near.\u201cMm.\u201d\u201cDong, dong, dong.\u201dWithout warning, a few light raps rang out from the door.\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Little Qiao hurriedly rose to open the door. Not long after, Lu Sheng heard her voice as she spoke to another person, followed by a soft sound of the door closing gently.\u201cWho was it?\u201d Lu Sheng had just finished his breakfast and risen to change into his training clothes.\u201cIt was a houseman from the Song Family, he came to deliver a letter,\u201d Little Qiao handed the letter in her hand to Lu Sheng. \u201cPlease take a look, Young Master.\u201dLu Sheng took it and saw the words on the letter: \u201cTo Brother Lu\u201d. Immediately, he knew that it was from Song Zhenguo. Among his friends, only Song Zhenguo was surnamed Song and was on close terms with him.Tearing open the envelope, he read the letter. The gist of the letter was that tomorrow was the Scented Satin Festival and he was going to redeem Jun\u2019er at the pleasure boat then and would like to invite him to go along as a witness in celebration. In closing, he even emphasized that Lu Sheng must definitely come and that he would treat him to a feast.\u201cRedeem?\u201d Lu Sheng mumbled. He had long since noticed that Jun\u2019er had an unusual relationship with Song Zhenguo, but had not expected that he was truly in love with her and was intending to redeem her.But since he was on close terms with Song Zhenguo and was relatively unoccupied, there was no harm in going. Moreover, he was being invited to a treat.Lu Sheng kept the letter and stuffed it into his drawer and locked it. Then, he lifted up a straight saber and was about to leave. When he got into his room to change, he looked at his current self in the bronze mirror.Recently, he clearly sensed that the power of Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill was gradually showing itself in him. This radically altered inner force was slowly but surely nourishing and strengthening his body and spirit.Together with the high-heat stimulation of Black Fury Skill, Lu Sheng could feel that his five bowels and six viscera were continually being purged of impurities and toxins at every single moment.This transformation made him feel as if the strength and endurance of his body was already not necessarily any worse than that of those hard body skill experts\u2013even though he had never practiced any hard body skills.He lifted his saber and swung it casually under the activation of Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill and Black Fury Skill. Immediately, the air hummed and buzzed as the saber cut across the air. Lu Sheng raised his saber-wielding right arm. Since a time unbeknownst to him, his arm had started to be filled with massive amounts of blackish red veins and arteries, making it look savage and hideous.Recently, he had become much more muscular. If he weren\u2019t wearing long robes but tight-fitting clothes instead, the bulge of his muscles would be clearly visible\u2013evenly distributed and aesthetically pleasing. Compared with the average scholar, albeit a slightly lanky one, an elbow of his was as thick as someone\u2019s thigh.\u2018I need a better saber.\u2019Lu Sheng raised his straight saber. The blade of the saber reflected his face, but there were also many fine cracks and dents in it at the same time. \u2018This saber is almost broken.\u2019Suddenly, a series of faint footsteps came from outside the door, as if someone was attempting to sneak into his bedroom stealthily. The footsteps rhythm, moreover, sounded entirely different from Little Qiao\u2019s.\u201cWHO\u2019S THERE!\u201d\u201cROAR!!!\u201dA tiger\u2019s roar!Lu Sheng\u2019s head spun round, his eyes wide open. Inner Qi gushed forth from within his body and an intense, fierce and murderous aura burst out instantly. A deafening tiger\u2019s roar rang out from the violent turbulence of his Inner Qi in the air.Horror-struck, a girl outside his door fell backwards to the ground on her butt. It was Zheng Yu\u2019er.Her face was as white as a sheet of paper, clearly frightened. Her legs were soft as jelly and had lost their ability to stand in that second.\u201cWu wu wu\u2026 Brother Lu, you bullied me\u2026\u201dZheng Yu\u2019er had wanted to sneak up on Lu Sheng to give him a surprise. Little did she expect to be thunderstruck herself. In that instant, tears gushed out of her eyes.\u201cWu wu wu\u2026\u201d Zheng Yu\u2019er cried inconsolably. Helpless, Lu Sheng went to help her up and tried to comfort her.\u201cIt was like seeing a giant black tiger pouncing on Yu\u2019er; it scared the hell out of me!\u201d Zheng Yu\u2019er\u2019s face was still white.\u201cNext time, don\u2019t sneak up on me behind my back like that. It\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d Lu Sheng caressed Zheng Yu\u2019er\u2019s head. \u201cWhy are you here? Where\u2019s your brother?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s still in the Institution. Tomorrow is the Scented Satin Festival. What arrangements do you have, Brother Lu?\u201d Zheng Yu\u2019er recovered her usual self, rubbed her eyes and quickly asked.\u201cA friend asked me out for some drinks.\u201d\u201cAH?! Too late again!!!\u201d Zheng Yu\u2019er instantly cried out in disappointment. \u201cSigh\u2026 alright, alright, I\u2019ve got to hurry and look for the next person in case they get pre-booked\u2026 I\u2019m leaving first, Brother Lu!\u201d She seemed as if she had now found another goal. Hurriedly, she dashed out of the room. Quickly she came, and quickly she left.Little Qiao ran in at this moment too, tears welling up in her eyes.\u201cMiss Yu\u2019er wouldn\u2019t let me say it was her\u2026 Young Master\u2026 I\u2026\u201d\u201cIn the future, regardless of whoever it is who comes through that door, you must inform me in advance,\u201d Lu Sheng instructed calmly.\u201cYes\u2026 yes\u2026\u201d Qiao\u2019er was alarmed at the severity of Lu Sheng\u2019s tone and quickly nodded her head in agreement.Lu Sheng glanced at her again, then left the room with his saber.He wondered if a certain murderous air about him was getting thicker and thicker recently. A peaceful and stable environment didn\u2019t seem very beneficial to his cultivation of Black Fury Skill. Every now and then, he would feel the impulse to kill, destroy, decimate and massacre. Perhaps this was the side-effect of Black Fury Skill.***The next day, the streets were filled with lively troupes of folk singers preparing for the Scented Satin Festival, as well as acrobats, people throwing gaily-decorated balls, monkey trainers, stunt performers and so on.All sorts of activities were performed in close quarters on the thus cramped streets, which got livelier and more crowded towards the city center.As usual, Lu Sheng read his books, cultivated inner Qi and practiced his saber and palm techniques. It was not till the evening that Lu Sheng headed for the spot where he had agreed to meet Song Zhenguo.The rendezvous point was the spot beneath a row of willow trees by Cypress Pine Lake.Song Zhenguo had already been waiting there, Chen Jiaorong beside him.\u201cBrother Lu, Brother Yue Sheng! You\u2019re too slow, too slow!\u201d Song Zhenguo laughed heartily as he patted Lu Sheng\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI and Jiaorong have been waiting here for you for quite a while.\u201d [1]Even since Wang Ziquan\u2019s incident, he had seen the true colors of many of his supposed \u201cfriends\u201d. Hence, he quickly distanced himself from them and pushed them out from his life. There were only two whom he considered his true friends.One was Chen Jiaorong, who was also Chen Yunxi\u2019s brother.The other was Lu Sheng.Today, he was going to redeem Jun\u2019er and hence had invited Lu Sheng and Chen Jiaorong as witnesses. At the same time, he had asked them to come along and celebrate.He had at first intended to come alone. But after thinking it over many times, he felt that he couldn\u2019t bear to not even inform his two best friends about such a big matter.So, in the end, he still wrote to both of them, inviting them to come along.\u201cToday\u2019s Brother Song\u2019s big day! A whole night of pleasure and love, hehehe, and yet you still specially got us both to come and watch. That\u2019s not fair,\u201d Chen Jiaorong pointed at Song Zhenguo in laughter.\u201cBrother Song only cares about his own happiness, how will he remember us, his friends?\u201d Lu Sheng laughed and joked along.\u201cLet\u2019s cut the chatter and run along. Delay no more\u2026 let\u2019s board the boat!\u201d Song Zhenguo smiled,\u201cTonight, there\u2019s something for all of us!\u201dImmediately, Chen Jiaorong\u2019s eyes lit up. Pulling Lu Sheng along with him, the three of them headed towards the pleasure boat moored nearby.The pleasure boat floated silently in front of the harbor. On it, people milled up and down; the place was packed with guests, creating a lively scene.On the boat\u2019s side, by the window of a chamber, Jun\u2019er sat before the window, staring wide-eyed in shock at the three of them\u2013including Song Zhenguo.\u2018How can it be??? How!!! Brother Song clearly promised me that he wouldn\u2019t come today!?\u2019 Jun\u2019er\u2019s face turned pale, her hand gripping the corner of the table like a vice. Her teeth had bitten blood out of her lower lip, but she was unaware of it.\u2018How can this be?!\u2019Jun\u2019er\u2019s heart sunk in despair. She knew her master\u2019s target was precisely Song Zhenguo, her Brother Song. That was why she secretly tipped Brother Song in advance not to come to the pleasure boat today. \u2018But why has he still come today? And why does he look so happy and excited?\u2019Jun\u2019er felt all the strength depart from her body, leaving it completely devoid of life. She wanted to rush out of the room, find Song Zhenguo and chase him away. But, she knew that she could not.\u201cHeeheehee\u2026\u201dAbruptly, a shrill female laughter rang out from a corner of the room.Jun\u2019er looked in that direction immediately.In the room, on her own bed, a long-haired woman in a white dress was seated since god-knows-when.The woman\u2019s hair fell like a waterfall over her entire head and face. Not a bit of her facial features could be seen. Her body was so bony and spindly that it seemed as if it would fall apart under a gust of wind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The woman clearly sat facing her squarely, yet the black hair still covered her face entirely.\u201cI\u2019m the one who got him to come\u2026\u201d with a smile, the woman cleared Jun\u2019er\u2019s confusion.\u201cNo\u2026 you can\u2019t do that\u2026\u201d Jun\u2019er felt all strength leaving her body. A gush of excruciating despair welled up from the depths of her heart, overwhelming her entire being. Tears, as thick as pearls, flooded uncontrollably from the corners of her eyes.The woman got up leisurely and walked towards her.\u201cThe man surnamed Song is prey prepared way in advance, yet you want to let him go? That\u2019s against the rules.So, I impersonated you and wrote to him\u2026 oh? He didn\u2019t just come alone, but also brought along two other pieces of fresh meat\u2026 not bad\u2026\u201dThey had been laying a trap for people like Song Zhenguo who were born in the Yin hour for a very long time now. Naturally, they were definitely not going to let even a single fish slip through the net. After all, such people were a rarity.Tears streaming down her face, Jun\u2019er\u2019s body stiffened and was completely immobile. She allowed that woman to lightly caress her face at will. Then, that hand slowly extended to reach into her brains, almost like poking into it. After it entered from the temples, it began to stir gently.As the woman began to stir, Jun\u2019er\u2019s intelligent eyes slowly turned into a pair of entrancing, bewitching eyes. A thin layer of alluring gloss shone on her skin. Even the air around her emanated a slight, mild fragrance that was exceptionally attractive.However, the long-haired woman noticed a trace of heart-rending despair that remained in Jun\u2019er\u2019s eyes.\u201cStay here by yourself for a moment to clear your head. As for that man surnamed Song, I\u2019ll let someone else do it,\u201d realizing that something was amiss, the woman instantly withdrew her hand.With a cold harrumph, she disappeared from the chamber.Jun\u2019er sat alone in the room, her face drenched in tears.***Song Zhenguo led Chen Jiaorong and Lu Sheng up the pleasure boat.\u201cYoung Master Song, Young Master Chen, Young Master Lu, it\u2019s a big day today! The program\u2019s all been arranged for you, we\u2019re just waiting for your arrival,\u201d once they boarded, the boat mistress was all smiles as she came forward to welcome them.\u201cWhere\u2019s Jun\u2019er?\u201d Song Zhenguo asked cheerfully.\u201cStill dolling up. Young Master Song, you\u2019ve to cherish her well today,\u201d the boat mistress said lightly, still smiling.\u201cWith pleasure, with pleasure!\u201d Song Zhenguo could not contain his joy as a wide smile broke out on his face. Bringing Lu Sheng and Chen Jiaorong along, they entered a chamber that had been prepared for them in advance.The three of them sat down. The night was misty outside the window; pale moonlight shone in like faint gauze, spilling onto the window ledge.The boat mistress didn\u2019t leave either. After bringing the three of the into the room, she clapped once with her hands. Almost immediately, a line of veiled ladies filed into the room, one after another.All these ladies were wearing real bodice undergarments: a white sash for the top, and just a strip of thin gauze at the bottom that covered the space between their legs. That piece of thin gauze was even a translucent pale green.Each of these ladies had lithe, elegant bodies that were aesthetically pleasing. Even with their veil on, one could clearly see their pretty and delicate features.One of the ladies hugged a pipa, which she began to strum lightly as she strolled into the room.The music was sweet and pleasing to the ears, instantly causing the three of them to shudder in excitement. Their bodies were already excited by the ladies\u2019 dressing; now, the blood in their veins boiled.The pipa tune was extremely gentle and soft, like the lovey-dovey whispers of a lover into one\u2019s ear. Music pleasing to the ears slowly drifted about. The eyes of all three of them glazed over as they reveled in the moment, listening.Very soon, dishes and wine were brought in, plate after plate. All the foodstuffs were aphrodisiacs.Song Zhenguo\u2019s face was rosy. Smilingly, he kept urging Lu Sheng and Chen Jiaorong to tuck in.Lu Sheng stopped eating after grabbing two mouthfuls of food. Instead, he just sat in his seat and enjoyed the music.That meal lasted a whole two hours and more, with three batches of female entertainers who came and went. All three of them drunk to their hearts\u2019 content.\u201cActually, this pleasure boat ordinarily doesn\u2019t allow any physical intimacy. However, today is an exception. The boat master agreed that as long as I redeem Jun\u2019er and bring her back tonight, then the three of us can pick and choose any lady to our liking from those entertainers earlier and spend the night with her,\u201d Song Zhenguo was somewhat pleased with himself as he happily boasted.\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d It was the first time that Chen Jiaorong had heard of such an arrangement. \u201cThis pleasure boat has never competed for business with the brothels,\u201d he had a look of surprise.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m celebrating! Not any average Joe can lay his hand on the female entertainers here. My brothers, don\u2019t stand on ceremony! I already have Little Jun. As for the other ladies, I couldn\u2019t care less about them. The two of you, though, can pick one or two!\u201d Song Zhenguo laughed.\u201cNow that\u2019s novel,\u201d Lu Sheng cast a look outside. The sky had gradually turned dark; it was a mystery how much time they had spent on the boat. Outside, the number of customers who were walking around had also gradually trickled to a few. The faint conversations that could occasionally be heard from the deck were almost entirely gone now.\u201cWhy not play a game of Pot \u2018n\u2019 Arrows. It\u2019s Scented Satin Festival today! If we perform well in Pot \u2018n\u2019 Arrows, we could have some free add-on services,\u201d Song Zhenguo had spent a lot of time on the pleasure boats, and was very familiar with these practices.Lu Sheng didn\u2019t protest. Chen Jiaorong also smiled in agreement.The three of them thus got the pleasure boat ladies to carry over a pot and some arrows. Song Zhenguo was the first to retrieve an arrow to aim it into the pot as Lu Sheng and Chen Jiaorong watched on.Occasionally, when they hit the target, the ladies at the side would clap and cheer, all the while laughing delicately. Chen Jiaorong was somewhat intoxicated after all the drinking. He reached over and pulled the most petite and dainty lady into his embrace, whispering sweet nothings into her ear and teasing her. The air was laced with sensuality.Pot \u2018n\u2019 Arrows was a banquet game where the players tried to aim arrows into a pot about as big as a bottle. It was considered a popular, widespread game that was enjoyed by both the scholarly literati as well as the ordinary folk.After calculating the hour, Lu Sheng asked the lady next to him casually, \u201cIt\u2019s already so late, don\u2019t you guys close for business?\u201d\u201cNo, we don\u2019t close for business,\u201d the lady replied him with a slight smile.Lu Sheng looked at her smile, and thought that something about it seemed odd, yet he was unable to tell what exactly felt wrong to him. After thinking for a moment and coming to nothing, he again turned his attention to Song Zhenguo.The three of them played for a while.\u201cIt\u2019s late, we should head back to wash up. We\u2019ll be back in a moment to accompany you,\u201d one of the dancers in charge of the lady entertainers spoke gently.\u201cGo, go,\u201d Song Zhenguo waved his hand.The ladies again filed out of the chamber one by one, and the last in the line closed the door gently.At once, the room grew quiet.The three of them sat on low couches. Before them lay a complete mess of wine and dishes, splayed out across the floor. There were two entire wine jugs that lay by the side.\u201cI\u2019ve drunk too much tonight,\u201d Cheng Jiaorong shook his head.\u201cDon\u2019t hold up what\u2019s important,\u201d Song Zhenguo laughed. \u201cYou need to go to the latrine?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go wash my face.\u201dShaking his head, Lu Sheng rose and left the chamber.It was gray and gloomy outside, which was the central main hall of the boat. The doors of all the chambers lined outside were shut tight, without a single lady entering or leaving in sight. Lu Sheng felt somewhat lightheaded and dizzy himself from all the drinking, and so went in the direction of the latrine.After going to the latrine and washing his face, he felt fresher and much more awake. He wiped his face and walked out. After only a few steps, he suddenly jolted in place.Light from the main hall reflected off the floor outside the latrine. Except\u2026 the color of that light was different from what he remembered previously.\u2018I remember that the light was previously yellow?\u2019 Narrowing his eyes, Lu Sheng stared at the patch of brilliant scarlet on the ground.It was deafeningly silent, to the extent that one could even hear a pin drop. Even the waves crashing against the body of the boat outside could not be heard. Lu Sheng lowered his head to look at the red light beneath his feet in detail. Then, he gently lifted his legs to walk out of the latrine and back to the main hall.Silence covered the main hall. The yellow lanterns that had hung there previously had somehow, at some unknown time, changed into red lanterns. A faint scarlet hue painted the entire main hall that color.Lu Sheng walked over to the railing, where he looked down. He was now on the second level. The level below, the first level, was similarly empty without a soul in sight. Earlier, before he entered the latrine, he had still seen some ladies and customers. However, they had now all vanished. Only a gust of cold wind swept across the area.Lu Sheng\u2019s brows furrowed. Quickening his footsteps, he headed towards the chamber.When he reached the chamber, he pushed open the door to find that both Chen Jiaorong and Song Zhenguo were nowhere to be found. Perhaps they both had also gone to the latrine and were not yet back.He had just rounded a corner when his eyes focused in concentration. Two large lanterns were actually hung in the chamber.The two red lanterns were hanging silently right above the spot where they had sat to wine and dine. God-knows-who hung those up.Wind blew on the open door of the chamber, within which not a sound could be heard. Lu Sheng looked at the lanterns, then surveyed his surroundings.\u201cBrother Song? Brother Chen?\u201dHe tried calling out twice, but received no response.In that moment, he thought back to that strange red-decked boat he had visited previously. His eyes immediately turned troubled.Sitting back down, Lu Sheng rested both his hands on his knees, waiting in silence for Song Zhenguo and Chen Jiaorong to return. If they had indeed gone to visit the latrine, then they would definitely come back to this room.After waiting for a while, the sound of crisp footsteps suddenly drifted from beyond the doorway.The footsteps drew nearer and nearer, then soon stopped just beyond the room entrance, right at the corner that was Lu Sheng\u2019s blind spot.\u201cBrother Song?\u201d Lu Sheng got up and tried calling out.That person was standing just around the corner, not making a single sound.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes constricted and his hand rested on the hilt of the short saber at the back of his waist. He had specially purchased this saber for self-defense. It was only about the length of a forearm, and when stuck into his robes at the back of his waist, it was virtually hidden.He walked slowly to the entrance, making sure to keep his footsteps light.Yet just when he rose, a deathly pale figure gradually floated behind Lu Sheng. An indistinct, white shadow of a person, dressed in long, draping white clothes, was floating behind him. Soundlessly, it extended a claw towards the back of Lu Sheng\u2019s head.\u201cChchch\u2026 \u201dWithout warning, Lu Sheng reached out and grabbed the edge of the wooden wall, pressing into it and leaving a faintly dark palm print on the wall.Startled by the sound and movement, the white-clothed person immediately withdrew its claw. It looked towards the wooden wall\u2013only to discover that it was but some accidentally produced noise. Then, it turned its head around and extended its claw once again to grab at Lu Sheng\u2019s back.Except that, this time, it found itself staring straight into Lu Sheng, who had spun round. A pair of frighteningly brilliant eyes bore straight into its own.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s face cracked into a smile, revealing a set white teeth that sent a chill to the bones.Shocked, the white-clothed person swiftly floated backwards, fusing into the wall behind it in an instant.\u201cBOOM!!!\u201dIn the blink of an eye, a streak of black shadow violently slammed into the wall. A silver saber gleam brazenly chopped at the wall as if it were slashing into a waterfall.It was Lu Sheng!Without another word, he had actually struck head on in one stroke. The massive force and explosive power that erupted allowed him to smash the wall into smithereens, as easily as cutting a slab of tofu. He dashed off in hot pursuit of the white-clothed person.The white-clothed person was astonished. It continued to float into the neighboring chamber, where it once again fused into a second slab of wall.\u201cBOOOOM!\u201d\u201cDIEEE!!!\u201dA violent explosion rang out as the wall was smashed into bits. Within it, a deafening, ear-splitting roar reverberated. Lu Sheng pursued relentlessly. Once again, he destroyed the wall in one swift stroke and lunged towards the white-clothed person.Veins popped up all over his body, his blood boiling and wildly coursing through them. His whole person seemed to swell up, causing him to expand to a much larger stature than his original physical size. He looked just like a mini giant.When compared to his massive physique, the saber in his hand was barely a small tree branch squeezed between his fingers. The width of the saber blade wasn\u2019t even a third of the size of his forearm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And yet, it continuously hacked through two wooden walls, which were even made of specially treated wood to boot. The saber blade hacked into the white-clothed person, carrying with it the aftershock of the attack.\u201cRIP!!!\u201dA tearing sound like that of cloth being ripped could be heard. Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes were bloodshot. In one slash of the saber, he sliced the white-clothed person into two halves.The saber spun round, splitting a wooden table on the side into two pieces along the way.His watchful gaze swept across the room. Black Fury Skill revolved quickly all over his body. A tyrannical air of violent savagery emanated from his chest, lingering about him without dispersing in the least.\u201cBOOM!\u201dHe kicked away the eight-seater desk that was in his way, sending it flying into the wall and then falling apart on the deck in pieces. Still, he faintly perceived that someone was spying on him from the dark.\u201cYOU COURT DEATH!!!\u201d Lu Sheng roared madly, striking with Tiger Kill of the Black Tiger Saber Technique. \u201cGET OUT HERE!\u201dThe saber force smashed into the wall before him like a thunderstorm. A huge bang rang out in the midst of the tiger roar.\u201cKA-BOOM!!!\u201dMore than half of the entire wall was smashed into smithereens by Lu Sheng, whose force was being amplified by Black Fury Skill. Broken bits and pieces of black wood flew all over.Behind the third destroyed wall, a woman dressed in white appeared before his eyes, her face covered with long hair.Song Zhenguo and Jun\u2019er were huddled in a corner, staring at her with eyes filled with despair and hysterical fear. Little did they expect that Lu Sheng would come across them at this moment.In the first few seconds, both of them were stunned. After they recognized Lu Sheng, however, their shock turned into joy as they watched Lu Sheng charge towards the white-clothed woman like a deity descended from heaven.Song Zhenguo was about to rise and approach them, but he was pulled back by Jun\u2019er abruptly.\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong! Wait first!\u201d Blood trickled down the corner of Jun\u2019er\u2019s mouth. She had been hurt at some point in time. Right now, she was staring at Lu Sheng, clearly sensing that something was out of the ordinary about this person.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? That\u2019s Brother Lu. That\u2019s Brother Yue Sheng! I didn\u2019t know that he was so strong, so powerful! He must have come to rescue me!\u201d Song Zhenguo explained hurriedly, his spirits reinvigorated.\u201cLook closely again!\u201d Jun\u2019er reminded in a hushed tone.Song Zhenguo paused, then quickly turned and look. Only then did he find that Lu Sheng looked odd.\u201cHEEHEEHEE\u2026\u201d the woman\u2019s figure flew backwards, sending massive volumes of oily green fireballs, which looked like human heads, flying towards Lu Sheng.Several dozens of green fireballs cut off all his escape routes.Black Fury Skill rippled to its maximum power on Lu Sheng. His heart was presently filled with a tyrannical, murderous intent to destroy and kill. The short saber in his hand vibrated intensely. Copious amounts of inner Qi flooded into his right arm, channeling into the saber\u2019s blade as he slashed forward with it.\u201cROAR!\u201dA deafening tiger roar!Silver saber light formed the shape of a gigantic axe, colliding squarely with the oncoming green fireballs.\u201cBOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM\u2026\u201dA series of bursting sounds, like the sound of gas balloons being burst, rang out. Huge volumes of green fire were burst apart and fell all over, covering the hanging red lanterns in flames. The flames rapidly spread along the rugs and leather.\u201cA pugilistic expert? An inner and outer force double-cultivator? Not bad,\u201d the woman shrieked in laughter. Her body floated into the air slowly and she waved her hand.Instantly, a string of round black orbs flew in from the gaping hole in the broken wall. Several dozens of orbs smashed towards him before he could realize what was happening.\u201cTiger Might!\u201d Lu Sheng gripped the saber in both hands, the giant frame of his body forming a stark contrast with the compact, short saber. Presently, however, the short saber was vibrating at an incredible speed, turning brighter and brighter as it reflected the light of the flames, becoming glaring to behold.\u201cHOO!\u201dLike a giant tiger, a gust of wind swept forward like a tornado. Lu Sheng pounced forward. His explosive speed across the short distance even surpassed his earlier speed when he was hunting down the white-clothed person.He continuously dodged and actually evaded every single one of those orbs. Then finally, at an unfathomable speed, he hacked down on the woman\u2019s neck.\u201cSPLAT!\u201dA human head flew up in the air. Lu Sheng rode on the momentum of his saber and delivered another slash as he swung it back!\u201cSPLAT.\u201dThe white-clothed woman was sliced into two halves diagonally. An ear-piercing shriek rang out.The fire grew stronger and stronger. Quickly, the beams of the chamber were burnt through and collapsed all of a sudden.After striking with his full might, Lu Sheng had barely come to the end of his strike when the horizontal beam slammed onto him. All around him, fire rolled towards him as if it were alive, engulfing him in flames and covering him from sight.\u201cLU SHENG!!!\u201dOnly then did Song Zhenguo and Jun\u2019er dash out from the corner of the room in an attempt to save him. But their efforts were in vain.The bean had slammed into Lu Sheng right on the top of his head and the raging flames had consumed him entirely in the blink of an eye. He was no longer visible.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Jun\u2019er clutched onto Song Zhenguo tightly.\u201cYUE SHENG! BROTHER LU!\u201d Song Zhenguo bellowed.\u201cBoth of you should worry about yourselves first.\u201dAstonishingly, the white-clothed woman appeared again. Her body was already perfectly intact, without a single wound. Lightly, she floated beside the fire in the chamber, staring at the two of them deviously with a pair of dark eyes under the hair.The duo including Song Zhenguo rushed out of the door without even daring to turn their heads.\u201cIt\u2019s me! I\u2019m the one who sent Brother Lu to his death!\u201d Tears welled up in Song Zhenguo\u2019s eyes. Anger and grief overwhelmed him.\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it after we escape!\u201d Jun\u2019er said decisively.\u201cZOOM!\u201dThe white-clothed woman shot out behind them, right at their heels.\u201cTRYING TO RUN!?\u201d she shrieked loudly.\u201cARGHHHHHHH!!!\u201dJust then, a bellow rang out from within the flames behind the woman. A muscular figure, flames still burning here and there on his body, pushed away the beam and leapt from the fire into the air.Sparks flew as a giant hand emerged from the flames and gripped onto her.\u201cYOU!!?\u201d The white-clothed woman\u2019s head turned in fear and shock.But all she saw was Lu Sheng pouncing towards her, his saber sweeping through the flames, conjuring up a massive wave of red and then hacking downwards squarely above her head.\u201cRIP!\u201dOnce again, the woman was hacked into two halves by Lu Sheng.But, unbelievably, the two halves of her body began to merge rapidly again, recovering its original form.\u201cA mere mortal! How dare you\u2026\u201d she screamed, black hair flying about madly behind her. Her hands lay over each other, forming a strange hand sign. Then, her white dress instantly turned into streaks and streaks of white cloth, shooting towards Lu Sheng and enveloping him.\u201cDie!\u201d Streaks after streaks of white cloth shot at him, each emitting sharp roars as they cut through the air.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes were blood-red. Flames still smoldered on his robes and white smoke was billowing out of some spots on him.After a series of moves that had exhausted the Black Fury Skill, he was gradually regaining some sobriety.He could sense that a large surface area of his body had been burnt. Lu Sheng quickly accelerated Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill. The improved version of Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill boasted strong healing abilities. Before long, Lu Sheng could feel the scorching burn on many parts of his body alleviating significantly.But with this change of Inner Qi, both Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill and Black Fury Skill activated at high speed within him and Lu Sheng immediately sensed an extraordinary transformation occurring within him.Two warm currents were spinning in him; one was violent while the other was serene.He held onto his saber and stared doggedly at the woman floating in mid-air. Unexpectedly, an indescribable feeling arose in his heart.Two streams of Inner Qi, one left and the other right, flowed into his left and right arms respectively. Then, they merged and entangled with each other on the short saber in the grip of both his hands, generating a formidable and fierce might.Following the flow of this power, Lu Sheng\u2019s body arched outwards slightly.The meditative diagrams of both the Black Tiger and Immortal Crane became one in his mind, entangling with each other.As if he had gained enlightenment, a red glow exploded out of Lu Sheng\u2019s saber in that very instant.\u201cROAR! SHRIEK!\u201dA high-pitched sound which was both like a tiger\u2019s roar and a crane\u2019s call rose to the heavens!In the midst of this sound, Lu Sheng leapt up in the air and stabbed his saber pencil-straight into the woman\u2019s body.\u201cKILL!\u201d\u201cBOOM!!!\u201dThis time, the massive force did not hack the woman into two halves. Rather, her body exploded with a blast into innumerable shards, which were lit ablaze by the flying sparks. These fell into the fire and no sound was heard from them again.\u201cThud!\u201dLu Sheng landed heavily on the deck, causing tremors throughout the entire pleasure boat. After a fit of heavy panting, he finally straightened his body slowly. He looked down and picked up a purple jade hairpin from the deck. This was the only object that had fallen off the woman\u2019s body.\u201cBrother Song. Looks like the heavens smile on you. You\u2019re fine even after all that,\u201d Lu Sheng smiled at the duo including Song Zhenguo not far from him on the deck, revealing a row of snow-white teeth.\u201cBrother\u2026 Brother Lu\u2026?\u201d After fully witnessing the tremendous battle earlier, Song Zhenguo was seriously doubting if his new friend and brother was human after all.\u201cLet\u2019s find Brother Chen. We should be getting off the boat. Otherwise, if we dawdle for too long, we may be unable to leave anymore,\u201d Lu Sheng lifted his arms. His charred clothes were now stuck to his skin. Fortunately, Black Fury Skill gave him very high heat endurance. Moreover, his actions in the battle earlier were too violent and quick, preventing the flames on his body from burning on in a vicious cycle. Hence, his burn wounds were not significant.\u201cSo\u2026 that female ghost\u2026 she\u2019s gone just like that?\u201d Song Zhenguo asked, stunned.\u201cNo idea. But she should be gone,\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head. His gaze fell on Little Jun.Little Jun returned his gaze with a gentle and grateful smile.The three of them swiftly found the fainted Chen Jiaorong in a corner of the boat. Song Zhenguo carried him on his back and the four of them alighted the boat at the harbor. They had only just gotten off it when the pleasure boat behind them lit up in flames. The huge fire was clearly visible on Cypress Pine Lake.Strangely enough, they suddenly discovered that they were no longer at the spot by the lake near Mountain-Edge City. Rather, they were at a lakeside area in a deserted wilderness.The four of them stepped on land and surveyed their surroundings. To their surprise, they saw no signs of human presence. Everywhere was a wilderness, filled with wild grass.Lu Sheng took Song Zhenguo\u2019s outer robe and changed into it.After ripping his clothes off his body, only a small portion of his skin was burnt. Most of it was merely black from the flames. The hair on his head, facial hair and whatnot had all been burnt clean.He was now as bald as an egg.They watched as the pleasure boat, consumed in flames, slowly sank into the lake till it disappeared. Only then did Lu Sheng look at Little Jun. Song Zhenguo also looked at Jun\u2019er at that moment. Both of them needed an explanation\u2013one that only Little Jun could give.What on earth had happened?At the sight of their stares, Jun\u2019er bowed her head and bit her lips in silence.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t stare at me. I actually don\u2019t know much about the pleasure boat. All that I know is that we\u2019re not an ordinary pleasure boat. There\u2019s a very mysterious and powerful leader above us. Most of the pleasure boats on the entire Cypress Pine Lake are under his control. And our pleasure boat also belongs to him officially.That woman had also been our boat master, in charge of us all this while. It\u2019s just that I had no idea that she\u2026 she was\u2026\u201d Jun\u2019er shook her head and sighed.\u201cLet\u2019s talk further after we get back,\u201d Lu Sheng stared at the surface of the vast and empty lake. \u201cWho knows where this is?\u201d\u201cLet me,\u201d Song Zhenguo laughed bitterly. \u201cIf I\u2019m not wrong, this should be a river downstream of Cypress Pine Lake outside Mountain-Edge City. It\u2019s at least more than ten miles away from Mountain-Edge City. We just need follow the river upstream.\u201dHe looked at Lu Sheng, who was entirely charred black. Pushing Jun\u2019er aside, he suddenly bowed deeply at the waist towards Lu Sheng.\u201cThis time, I almost led Yue Sheng and Jiaorong to your deaths. Because of Jun\u2019er and me, we almost got both of you embroiled in this mess.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid\u2026 this mess isn\u2019t quite over yet,\u201d Lu Sheng, however, shook his head gently at him.Song Zhenguo was stunned, but suddenly saw Lu Sheng\u2019s line of sight falling on Jun\u2019er beside him.He quickly turned to look at Jun\u2019er, only to see that her body, originally as solid as reality, was gradually turning translucent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He wrapped his arms around Jun\u2019er, his face the picture of worry. \u201cWhat happened to you? What happened!? JUST WHAT\u2019S GOING ON?!\u201dWrapped tightly in his embrace, Jun\u2019er smiled helplessly. \u201cElder Brother Song\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026\u201dLu Sheng stood at the side. Actually, he had long since guessed that Jun\u2019er may not be human. Now, unfortunately, his suspicion was confirmed.Perhaps all the ladies aboard the boat weren\u2019t human, but rather women who had died a long time ago. However, some special power bound them to the boat like fetters, exploiting their beauty for some secret agenda.He walked off silently, taking care not to disturb the both of them. Standing at an open space nearby to watch over Chen Jiaorong, he began to focus on recuperating from his injuries. With every circulation of the Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill, he felt a mild tingling sensation around his wounds. It was the sensation of his flesh recovering.More or less after the time it took an incense stick to burn, Song Zhenguo walked over. His eyes were bloodshot; Jun\u2019er had already disappeared without a trace.\u201cCome, let\u2019s go back\u2026\u201d he said solemnly, his voice somewhat hoarse.Lu Sheng pieced things together; Jun\u2019er must have had some links with the haunted boat Scarlet Decks after all. Now that the boat was no more, the people on board also perished. Perhaps Song Zhenguo too realized what was going on.Both of them headed back towards Mountain-Edge City silently as they carried Chen Jiaorong. Song Zhenguo kept silent throughout the journey; Lu Sheng did not say anything either. Only when they were almost at the city gates of Mountain-Edge City did Song Zhenguo ask abruptly, \u201cBrother Lu, can I learn martial arts from you?\u201d His eyes were both pleading and sorrowful. Clearly, Jun\u2019er\u2019s death dealt a huge blow to him.Lu Sheng stopped in his tracks. Looking at him, he sighed deeply. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a very powerful foe behind Jun\u2019er\u2019s incident. Otherwise, Mountain-Edge City\u2019s yamen wouldn\u2019t have allowed the ghost boat to stay moored on the lake so brazenly, causing harm to humans. In reality, they didn\u2019t really harm anybody on a day-to-day basis either. Perhaps it\u2019s just a cover-up for the moment when they needed to make a move.\u201dSong Zhenguo smiled bitterly, shaking his head, \u201cI understand all that you\u2019re saying. Brother Lu has already killed that white-dressed female ghost who was ultimately responsible for Jun\u2019er\u2019s death and avenged her. There\u2019s no issue now. It\u2019s just\u2026 I just don\u2019t want something like this repeating itself in the future\u2026\u201dLu Sheng looked at him and was able to see a deep sense of helplessness and misery within his eyes.\u201cYou should know that among all the martial arts in this world, the ordinary martial arts can be learned by simply forking out enough money. The truly exclusive ones, however, are not passed down casually.\u201dSong Zhenguo\u2019s eyes were resolute. \u201cWhat will it take for Brother Lu to be willing to teach me, then? Should I formally take you as my Master? No problem!\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 there\u2019s no hurry. I can\u2019t be certain whether you have the aptitude for martial arts training. You need to go through some tests first,\u201d Lu Sheng himself had only dabbled in martial arts halfway into life. He currently did not have a way to test one\u2019s aptitude, and could only use him as a trial.Moreover, exclusive martial arts could not be passed down casually. This was an established unspoken rule he did not wish to violate. Simply speaking, exclusive martial arts were largely the result of their creator\u2019s painstaking study as well as a very long process of trial and error. It was a martial arts skill that was created through the sacrifice of copious amounts of blood, sweat and tears, sometimes even at the expense of inflicting a grievous injury upon one\u2019s body.Without a good reason, who would be willing to pass down such an inheritance to just anybody? It was akin to an extremely wealthy merchant who casually handed over his empire, painstakingly built over decades, to some random outsider. How was that possible?This was the truth behind what many experts termed heirloom martial arts. It wasn\u2019t passed down to outsiders. Naturally, it was inherited only by one\u2019s family members.Lu Sheng had also heard of people who passed down martial arts to others casually. Often, such people had procured the martial arts too easily and did not treasure them.However, he couldn\u2019t care less about this. With the Modifier, it was futile for anyone to compete with him in martial arts cultivation speed. He could reach the pinnacle of any given skill faster than any other ordinary person by leaps and bounds.Therefore, what Lu Sheng was worried about was not this. Rather, he was afraid of exposing himself. Once others knew that his martial arts were extrapolated by himself out of a combination of different martial arts, it would very likely attract a lot of attention.This did not align with his plan to stay in the shadows as he raised his power secretly.\u201cHow about this\u2013I\u2019ll give you a test before I decide whether or not to teach you martial arts,\u201d Lu Sheng intended to take things as they came. If Song Zhenguo was indeed gifted, then he would pass down a basic skill to him first.\u201cGreat!\u201dSong Zhenguo was also aware that there would be some tests and the sort in the passing down of martial arts skills. The heroes in the popular novels all followed such a rule.Lugging Chen Jiaorong along, the two of them entered into the city one after another. Almost immediately, the boss of a clothing store at the city gates saw Chen Jiaorong and hurried off to relay the news.Given Lu Sheng\u2019s present appearance, it was inconvenient for him to be seen. Thus, he let Song Zhenguo carry Chen Jiaorong back to the Chen Family and provide an explanation while he himself slid away quietly to return home.On his entire way home, people on the street looked at him strangely. Many children even followed close behind him for a distance, as if he was some sort of novelty.Lu Sheng could do nothing but increase his pace. When he finally reached home, he groped around only to discover that his key and money pouch were both lost in the fire.\u2018That\u2019s a huge loss\u2026 all the silver notes were inside\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng stood in a daze, immediately feeling worse.\u201cDong, dong, dong.\u201dWith no other option, he knocked on the door.\u201cComing coming!\u201d Little Qiao hurried over, her crisp footsteps sounding out, \u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Lu Sheng replied. \u201cDropped my key. Open the door, Little Qiao.\u201dHearing his voice, she hastily opened the door.The door gradaully opened to reveal Little Qiao\u2019s pretty and cute face. With a smile, she raised her head to look over.The moment her eyes landed on Lu Sheng, the little girl was stupefied. Then, her two eyes bulged wide open. \u201cYou\u2026 you, you\u2026!!!\u201d After which, her eyes flipped as she fainted and fell to the ground.Lu Sheng was speechless. Hearing the startled sounds of the shopkeeper below, he quickly got into the room and lifted Little Qiao onto the bed. Then, he went to boil water for the wooden cask.After a spate of busyness, Lu Sheng was finally able to wash himself. He scrubbed viciously at the soot all over his body, which dyed the entire cask of water pitch-black. After that, Lu Sheng again prepared a basin of water and wiped his entire body with a towel. That too soon turned grayish black. Only then did he feel cleaner.A while after he had washed and dressed himself, Qiao\u2019er regained her senses. When she saw him, her eyes stretched widely. Only after careful examination was she able to identify Young Master Lu Sheng whom she attended to daily.Lu Sheng patiently explained himself, saying something along the lines of getting caught in a fire that burnt his clothes, but not sustaining any major injuries\u2026 after that, Qiao\u2019er hastily ran off to find a physician. Other than the money that was on Lu Sheng\u2019s person, there were still some taels of silver that had been saved for Little Qiao\u2019s daily expenses. It was still enough to get a physician.Tears welled up in Qiao\u2019er\u2019s eyes as she looked at the burn wounds all over Lu Sheng\u2019s body. She sat by the side as the physician slowly applied medication, looking like she wanted to reach out to soothe him, yet holding back in fear of hurting him.After applying medication over all his burn wounds, Lu Sheng stayed at home to rest. He did not even return to the study hall.He recovered from most of his injuries after staying home to recuperate for only half a month. It was just his skin that looked different from previously\u2013where there used to be hair, he was now entirely bald.What was strange about it was that there were actually no scars on his body from the fire. Rather, all his hair had been burnt. His entire appearance was bald; he had no hair, no eyebrows, and even his mustache was gone. He was all slick and smooth.After taking leave from school and staying home for a period, it was soon the time for the Annual Examinations.After Song Zhenguo returned, there was no news from him whatsoever. As for Chen Jiaorong, after he got back and got wind of what happened, he merely wrote a letter to Lu Sheng to thank him for saving his life. However, that letter did not mention anything about the supernatural on the ghost boat Scarlet Decks; most likely, Song Zhenguo had not shared about it with him. Even if he had, Jiaorong might not have believed him.In the letter, he mentioned that he had been grounded. Although going to the pleasure boat wasn\u2019t considered something evil, it was after all not a very upright thing to do and not something to be aired in public. Furthermore, the matter had been blown out of proportion this time round and he had almost been burnt to death. This threw his old man into a fit of furore, who ordered him to be grounded.Chen Yunxi herself came to personally express thanks to Lu Sheng, and even brought along a pair of white jade qilin as a token of appreciation. Representing her father, the household head of the Chen Family, she also invited him over as a guest once he was fully recovered.When she saw Lu Sheng\u2019s bald appearance, she got the fright of her life. However, she then found it rather amusing instead. Pursing her lips and keeping her worry to herself, she hung out with Lu Sheng for more than half a day. After laughing and joking around with him, she returned home late in the evening.After Lu Sheng recuperated at home for a while longer, gradually, his body fully recovered.Moreover, he decided to find some way to test the present strength and state of his body. Ever since the explosion at the pleasure boat, he had been feeling very troubled.Yet, before that, a person appeared out of the blue and somewhat disturbed his plans.***In a bustling teahouse near the military headquarters of Mountain-Edge City.High up on a red three-story teahouse, Lu Sheng sat facing a pretty lady in a black veil. They were seated in a private chamber on the highest level.On a table between them were various plates of teatime snacks, including melon seeds, chicken claws, fruits and nuts. A big vermilion-red pot was perched silently in the middle of the table, threads of steam still rising up from its mouth. In front of each of them was a teacup, half filled with swirling green tea.Lu Sheng reached forward to pick up a fried fig and put it into his mouth. His eyes, however, were fixed calmly on the woman sitting across him.\u201cHow many times have we met by now?\u201dDuanmu Wan laughed, fatigue showing on her face. \u201cI just happened to pass by on my way to meet a\u2026 err\u2026 a friend, I guess. Little did I expect to run into you on the street.\u201dShe had caught sight of Lu Sheng on his way out for breakfast as she rode across the street on horse. After the two of them encountered each other by chance, Lu Sheng suggested going somewhere for a drink together. Somehow, something came over her and she agreed to Lu Sheng\u2019s suggestion of sharing a pot of tea in a teahouse.\u201cDid Miss Duanmu go after that prized treasure previously?\u201d Lu Sheng had been able to learn insider information about the great incident in Nine Links City all thanks to Duanmu Wan. Hence, he now hoped to find out more of related intelligence from her, especially in regards to the world she belonged to.\u201cYea, that\u2019s right\u2026 those who want to find that thing\u2026 are many,\u201d Duanmu Wan was perceptibly exhausted. Her outfit consisted of a black gauze cloak which covered her entire body. On the hat stand beside them hung her big black conical hat. If Lu Sheng did not look up from below while on the street, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to recognize her.Lu Sheng glanced at her slender, fair hands. Her sleeves were torn and ripped, with some dried bloodstains on them. Her pants was soiled with some fine yellow mud spots, mud having splashed onto her as she rushed on her journey. Moreover, the dark circles underneath her eyes were a tell-tale sign of insufficient rest.\u201cYou\u2019re really tired,\u201d Lu Sheng sighed.Duanmu Wan nodded, sighing in return. No trace remained of the casual sensuality and flirtatiousness she exhibited on her first meeting with Lu Sheng.\u201cSome people always think that victory\u2019s in their hands. They refuse to listen to others no matter what they say, and only ever think that they\u2019re in the right. No matter what evidence you find to prove them wrong, it\u2019s all in vain\u2026 tell me, are people like that really a pain in the neck?\u201dLu Sheng fell silent.\u201cA pain in the neck indeed.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Suddenly, she laughed, \u201cYou lot have a better life in the end\u2026 knowing nothing, and not needing to know anything. All you need to do is to accept the result.\u201d\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Lu Sheng smiled and shook his head imperceptibly.\u201cSometimes, knowing too much makes you tired and frightened instead,\u201d Duanmu Wan whispered.\u201cEven so, I\u2019d rather know more. At least I\u2019d see a glimmer of hope to control my own destiny,\u201d Lu Sheng said calmly.\u201cMaybe,\u201d it was Duanmu Wan\u2019s turn to sigh this time.To be honest, their meeting was truly a coincidence.But when she caught sight of Lu Sheng, Duanmu Wan was subconsciously reminded of that person. The one whom she had admired but never had the opportunity to get close to.From the time he appeared on the scene, blossomed, climbed to the pinnacle, and then fell to his demise\u2026 from beginning to end, all she could do was to gaze at him from afar, without even the courage to express her feelings.When she saw Lu Sheng, she just couldn\u2019t help but see that person\u2019s shadow on him. That\u2019s why she agreed to have tea with him.Looking at Lu Sheng seated across her, Duanmu Wan laughed bitterly in her heart. If those people knew that she was having such a leisurely cup of tea with an ordinary mortal right now under such pressing circumstances, who knew what kind of mocking and ridicule would come her way?But then again, so what?She was the Autumn Princess! The vicious-hearted beauty feared by the masses. A poisonous snake and a scorpion. So what if they mocked and ridiculed? She wasn\u2019t bothered in the least.She did what she wanted to. Nobody could say a word to her.\u201cA word of reminder to you\u2013if you meet any Noblemen, get away as fast as you can. Especially if they\u2019re of direct lineage. Alright, let\u2019s change the topic. Drink up!\u201d Duanmu Wan lifted her teacup, emptying it in one gulp as if it were wine. Then, without caring about her image anymore, she reached out to grab some cakes.Lu Sheng spoke no further and simply accompanied her. He could tell that Duanmu Wan spirits hit rock bottom.Her world was an alien, unknown one to him. It was still too distant to the present him. But that did not prevent him from recognizing what it was that Duanmu Wan needed right now.What she needed now was simply to have someone to rest with her for a moment.Hence, despite all his burning questions and doubts, he refrained from saying even a single word, suppressing the itch to ask those questions. All he did was accompany Duanmu Wan in silent drinking.It wasn\u2019t until dusk had fallen and the streets began to be lined with mobile stalls selling grilled food that Duanmu Wan rose and departed.Quickly she came; quickly she left. As always, she remained an enigma.Lu Sheng exited the teahouse. The fragrant aroma of grilled meat skewers wafted on the streets. Oil lanterns hung from wooden poles and banners rose up from the ground, each bearing the names of all sorts of hawker stalls. A dense throng of people flowed between the stalls. People moved and stopped from time to time, chatting and laughing with one another.Lu Sheng wasn\u2019t sure how far away he was from Duanmu Wan\u2019s world. But that didn\u2019t matter to him. All he desired was the power to master his own fate in this turbulent world. That\u2019s all.On the second day after meeting Duanmu Wan, Lu Sheng once again came to the little valley where he usually trained.It was early in the morning. Rain had just fallen in the forest, which teemed with life. Dew drops hung and dripped from grass blades and leaves.After hanging up his outer robes, Lu Sheng stood in a clearing and quieted himself. Then, once again, he activated Black Fury Skill and Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill simultaneously, pouring inner Qi into both arms at the same time.As expected, a massive strength began to accumulate and vibrate intensely on both his arms, exactly like that night.Lu Sheng expended a great amount of effort, working hard to control this power and suppress its impulse to explode outwards.He meticulously examined the skin on both arms. Threads of blackish red veins covered the skin on his arms, like bloodstains caused by some lines entangled around them. Round and round they went, covering the whole stretch from his wrist to forearm.He stood still, stabilizing and bringing the inner Qi under control. It was approximately twenty percent of his total inner Qi volume; any more and it would induce a transformation of his physical body. This was a special state gradually formed after he had broken through Level Three of Black Fury Skill.When his control of inner Qi was stable, Lu Sheng struck out before him.\u201cBOOM!\u201dA ball of white Qi shot out in the air before him. Although it lasted the duration of only a blink, it also meant that his speed and explosive strength in that split second had achieved an incredibly powerful level.\u2018This move is extremely powerful. But my body can\u2019t bear the burden of using it more than a few times,\u2019 Lu Sheng estimated based on the weakness and numbness he felt in his arms after he stopped. \u2018I can use it three times consecutively within a short period of time\u2013that\u2019d be the limit. After that, I\u2019d need to rest or I\u2019d injure my muscles and bones.\u2019On the second attempt, Lu Sheng changed his saber-wielding arm and held his saber straight. Then, he activated Black Fury Skill and Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill simultaneously once again.\u201cSWISH!\u201dIn the midst of a tiger roar and a crane call, the large tree which Lu Sheng was testing his strike on was hacked into two halves in one slash.\u2018Ten percent strength. Tsk tsk\u2026 compared to Black Fury Skill alone, the explosive might, strength and speed of this strike is significantly higher,\u2019 he hesitated and decided to give it a better name. \u2018Let\u2019s just call it Tiger Roar &amp; Crane Song Saber. It\u2019ll be my final trump card. Raising my power by a whole stretch in one instant will definitely catch my opponents off-guard and seize victory in one move. But this stuff\u2019s good only for a short while. Three strikes and my body wouldn\u2019t be able to take itanymore while my inner Qi would run out,\u2019 Lu Sheng sensed that the inner Qi in him was exhausted by up to sixty percent. Clearly, this was indeed an incredibly powerful move.Having tested Tiger Roar &amp; Crane Song Saber\u2019s power and energy consumption level, Lu Sheng began to study the jade hairpin he had gotten from Scarlet Decks again.Taking the jade hairpin out from his waist pouch and holding it in his hands, Lu Sheng immediately felt threads of Yin Qi emanating from the hairpin.The hairpin was a purplish black, with a translucent body. On one end, it was carved with intricate plum blossom motifs while the pointed end was an entirely transparent segment.\u2018This jade hairpin\u2026 its craftsmanship is fine indeed. But too bad the Yin Qi on it is too thick. Otherwise, it\u2019d make a decent gift. Purple jade hairpins are usually extremely costly,\u2019 Lu Sheng held onto the jade hairpin, bit the index finger on his other hand, squeezed out a drop of blood and let it drip onto the surface of the hairpin.\u201cSzzz\u2026\u201dIn the instant when the drop of blood fell onto the hairpin, a layer of hazy smog immediately rose out of it.Lu Sheng held it further away from himself and blew the smog away. Instantly, thick, dense and cold Qi gushed into his palm without stopping, then coursed through his arm into his body, vanishing the instant it entered his torso.\u2018Deep Blue!\u2019 Lu Sheng rapidly summoned his Modifier.Without a pause, a blue frame appeared before him.A dialogue box sprang out from the Modifier: \u2018Begin martial arts extrapolation?\u2019\u2018Yes,\u2019 Lu Sheng selected.The frame flashed. This time, a \u2018modify\u2019 button actually appeared behind all his martial arts.\u2018As I expected! This time the amount of Yin Qi is sufficient to extrapolate all martial arts!\u2019 Lu Sheng was overjoyed. Quickly, he looked at Black Fury Skill. \u2018All my strength depends largely on Black Fury Skill. I\u2019ve got to upgrade and perfect Black Fury Skill first. And that side-effect which messes with my psychological state has got to go as well.\u2019His gaze fell on Black Fury Skill\u2019s row.\u2018\u2026I wonder whether or not I can extrapolate successive levels of Black Fury Skill with my accumulated knowledge now.\u2019Mustering his intent, he was about to click on the button for extrapolation behind Black Fury Skill when something cropped up in his mind. Abruptly, he paused and examined the description on the side.Black Fury Skill: Level Three. Special Effect(s): Fire Poison.\u2018Now there\u2019s an added special effects description\u2026 also, I can\u2019t be too hasty. I can\u2019t rush to upgrade Black Fury Skill now. The last time I upgraded to Level Three, it took me half a year to recover. This means that my present body is already unable to handle the massive accumulation required to upgrade Black Fury Skill.To attain the level which would normally require others decades to achieve in one breath\u2026 this requires a vast build-up to satisfy the minimum requirements. I shouldn\u2019t be too hasty now\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng calculated in his mind, and closed the Deep Blue Modifier after all.Standing in the clearing, he once again mentally reviewed the two inner force skills he had previously memorized\u2013Yin Yang Attraction and Green Pine One-Thought Formula.\u2018Green Pine One-Thought Formula seems to clash with the inner force, inner Qi, in my body. I\u2019m unable to sense Qi with it\u2026 or even reach the Initiation level. But Yin Yang Attraction, on the other hand, is worth a shot.\u2019Excitedly, he sat cross-legged and began quieting his mind and Qi according to the mantra of Yin Yang Attraction. He began to guide his will and intent to condense Qi in his body.Yin Yang Attraction was all about guiding the two forms of Qi that already existed in the body\u2013Yin Qi and Yang Qi\u2013by tempering them and bringing them into balance. This way, the body was immune to all sickness and longevity was extended. Judging from the language of the booklet, its creator should have been a physician.Rather than labelling it an inner Qi skill, it might be more precise to call it a life-force skill. This was because the inner Qi it generated wasn\u2019t its focus. It was merely the natural result of balancing the Yin and the Yang in one\u2019s body and the body\u2019s consequent strengthening. But this inner Qi was not the main purpose of this inner skill.The challenge of this skill lay in guiding two cycles simultaneously with one\u2019s mind in order to separate and control Yin Qi and Yang Qi.Previously, Lu Sheng had never practiced this. But presently, with the experience of simultaneously activating Black Fury Skill and Black Tiger Jade Crane skill, he very quickly entered a state of concentrated zen.In fact, the supposed Yin Qi and Yang Qi couldn\u2019t be detected by mind and will. It was merely a way of describing and labelling it. Yin Qi and Yang Qi actually represented two types of opposing yet mutually dependent forces.As the human body continued to generate Yin Qi, it was also producing Yang Qi. The two balanced each other out, maintaining an equilibrium.Lu Sheng meticulously recalled the theory written in the booklet, gradually entering a deeper and deeper level of meditative zen.He sat cross-legged in the clearing; occasionally, a rabbit or squirrel would hop by, but all stayed clear of him by a ten-meter radius, as if a lethal snake or a ferocious beast lay on that spot.Ever since Lu Sheng had broken through to Level Three of Black Fury Skill, such a sight occurred often. This increasingly showed Lu Sheng the extraordinariness of Black Fury Skill.After an immeasurably long period of time, a faint trace of Qi slowly pulsed in Lu Sheng\u2019s abdomen, then crawled upwards towards his kidneys and heart.\u2018It\u2019s there!\u2019 Lu Sheng\u2019s heart shook with excitement. Knowing that this strand of inner Qi may be fleeting and could vanish in the next second, Lu Sheng immediately called out, \u2018Deep Blue!\u2019The Modifier screen emerged, still under the same state after absorbing the Yin Qi just now. A button for extrapolation remained following each skill.Lu Sheng glossed over other martial arts, his gaze zooming in on Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill.\u2018Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill: Level Three Pinnacle. Special Effect(s): Rapid hemostasis.\u2019Underneath it was the newly-appeared Yin Yang Attraction.\u2018Yin Yang Attraction: Uninitiated.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Yin Yang Attraction\u2019s column blurred for a moment, first changing from Uninitiated to Initiated, then transforming again to Level One.In that moment, Lu Sheng could feel that the thread of inner Qi within his abdomen grew much more distinct. Besides that, he did not experience any change in his body. He called out again, \u201cUpgrade Yin Yang Attraction to the highest level, Level Two!\u201dThe Modifier flashed imperceptibly, after which the selection for Yin Yang Attraction once again changed. It directly jumped from Level One to the highest level, Level Two.In the instant Lu Sheng\u2019s state underwent transformation, he could feel the Black Tiger Jade Crane inner Qi within him depleting by an entire half in a matter of seconds.Then, a strand of calm and soothing sensation began to circulate within his body, slowly flowing through him along a third path.Three types of inner force skills and three paths of inner Qi intertwined within him, forming a somewhat spherical shape. Each travelling at their own speeds, they flowed ceaselessly within him. Once Yin Yang Attraction was successfully attained, Lu Sheng could feel an obvious difference in the state of his body compared to the one before.The parched sensation that usually bothered his throat had disappeared without a trace. The slight heatiness he used to feel in his chest had also completely vanished.His whole person felt an increased sense of equilibrium and wholeness.\u2018Looks like Yin Yang Attraction is able to nullify the negative aftereffects of Black Fury Skill. This inner force skill is indeed of a very high caliber\u2026\u2019 narrowing his eyes, Lu Sheng considered the matter silently. \u2018Perhaps Yin Yang Attraction can be used as the main skill for further extrapolation, and Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill to supplement it.\u2019After having thought that, he immediately set to action. He calmed himself down quickly to take advantage of the fact that he now had sufficient Yin Qi. Moreover, upgrading Yin Yang Attraction did not seem to put too much load on his body.\u2018Extrapolate the next level of Yin Yang Attraction,\u2019 he commanded in his head.In that instant, the entire world within the Modifier flashed violently, growing into a blur.Very soon, after no more than a few breaths of time, the world grew more distinct. As for the Yin Yang Attraction selection, it changed from the second level to display Level Three.Once Yin Yang Attraction had entered Level Three, Lu Sheng could even feel that the speed of Black Fury Skill flowing within him had gradually slowed down. The streak of scorching hot inner Qi from before now began to lower in temperature, and also grew more unhurried in its movement. It was now neither rushed nor sluggish.Lu Sheng exhaled lightly. His eyes finally came to rest on Black Fury Skill.\u2018With the inner Qi of Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill and Yin Yang Attraction as the foundation, next time, I should extrapolate Black Fury Skill\u2026\u2019His gaze fell on the selection behind Black Fury Skill when suddenly, he jolted in surprise. The button for extrapolation was actually still there!\u2018What\u2019s happening???\u2019Lu Sheng thought about the matter for a moment before soon gaining some clarity on what was going on.\u2018Most likely, the Yin Qi contained in the jade hairpin far surpassed the amount in the powder, so there is still some left after extrapolating an ordinary, low-level martial arts skill. This is enough to extrapolate a second martial arts skill. Yes, that should be the case!\u2019After thinking it through, Lu Sheng was in high spirits. Although he had suffered heavy losses after this incident, having all his hair burnt and losing his money pouch, these could not compare to the gains he had received.\u2018Begin extrapolating Black Fury Skill!\u2019He pressed lightly onto the button behind Black Fury Skill in his mind.\u201cSzzzz\u2026.\u201dThe Modifier flashed yet again and turned fuzzy.After about ten breaths\u2019 of time, the Modifier\u2019s display slowly changed. The status of Black Fury Skill also transformed from Level Three directly to Level Four. The description also changed to: \u2018Unknown Fire Poison Skill: Level Four\u2019.A streak of fire exploded out from Lu Sheng\u2019s perineum and rushed upwards along his chest and neck, then flooded into his head. After it entered his brains, it abruptly erupted into countless streams of warmth. Like the rejuvenating spring wind, it diffused throughout his entire head.\u201cWuu\u2026\u201dLu Sheng felt so comfortable he couldn\u2019t help but let out a sound.He gently pulled aside his clothes and looked down at the skin on his chest. On its surface there was actually a vein, crimson-red like blood, which seemed to divide his body into two halves. It was extremely eye-catching.\u201cThis\u2026 could this be the special effect of the fourth level of Black Fury Skill?\u201dHe carefully sensed the skill movement routes of Black Fury Skill Level Four.\u2018It feels somewhat like Yin Yang Attraction, yet also has the techniques of Heart-Shattering Palm\u2026 This is probably not the original version of the skill anymore. It has absorbed the essences of other inner force skills to fuse into one entity, creating a whole new realm of inner force. It shouldn\u2019t be called Black Fury Skill, I should change its name\u2026\u2019Looking at the vertical, blood-red line streaking down his body, Lu Sheng had an idea.\u2018This color is crimson red, like blood. Since it\u2019s extrapolated with Black Fury Skill as the main entity, I shall call it Blood Fury Skill then.\u2019The moment he made that decision, the Black Fury Skill selection within the Modifier swiftly transformed into one that read \u201cBlood Fury Skill\u201d.Lu Sheng glanced over the remaining martial arts skills to see whether they could be extrapolated. However, there weren\u2019t any buttons indicating so; clearly, all the Yin Qi from before had been depleted.\u2018Let\u2019s test out its power.\u2019Lu Sheng raised his hand to circulate the Qi. The inner Qi of Blood Fury Skill speedily shot through his body to flow into his right palm, which lightly slapped into the tree branch on his right.\u201cSzzz\u2026\u201dInstantly, gusts of white smoke rose up from the tree bark, followed by cackling sounds and the stench of something charred that drifted in the air. Lu Sheng\u2019s strike had so thoroughly charred the tree bark that a black palm print had been deeply imprinted on it!He himself was also taken aback by the sheer might of his single palm strike.\u2018This probably no longer falls within the realm of martial arts, does it?!\u2019 Lu Sheng was shocked, \u2018No matter how strong one is, wouldn\u2019t he be scorched anyway simply just by coming into contact with a palm of such might? What difference is there between this hand and an iron brand?!\u2019He gathered back his inner Qi and studied the palm print on the tree branch in detail. It seemed that the charred black palm print was the result of not just high temperature, but also largely due to some sort of poison which corroded and burnt the tree, leaving behind such an effect.Yet even if that were so, it remained very impressive.\u2018I wonder how my current skill level compares to the famed experts,\u2019 Lu Sheng was quietly satisfied, but did not have a concrete basis of comparison or any measure to know exactly how powerful he was.\u2018Besides, there isn\u2019t much money left at home. I\u2019d just asked them for quite a sum, and the family is now in the midst of relocating. I can\u2019t add to Old Dad\u2019s worries, I\u2019ve got to figure this out on my own.\u2019Lu Sheng thought for a moment. After reviewing his current circumstances, he was indeed able to come up with a swell idea. However, this idea could only be carried out after the Annual Examinations.The Annual Examinations were just three days away.\u2018Three days. After the Annual Examinations, I\u2019ll begin to carry out my earlier plan. Otherwise, without any money at home, there\u2019s no guarantee that I can even lay my hands on any nourishments and medications,\u2019 Lu Sheng felt that, lately, the nourishing medications had been somewhat insufficient. Although he had reserves of life-force inner Qi, it had taken noticeably longer for it to recuperate his body. If he delayed any longer, it might adversely affect his martial arts training.\u2018And there\u2019s also the issue of Yin Qi\u2026 don\u2019t tell me I have to go through some trouble before I\u2019m able to get my hands on them?\u2019 Lu Sheng suddenly recalled the piece of jade that Chen Jiaorong carried on his body, and began to formulate some plans in his head.\u2018Forget it, I\u2019ll head back to revise first and think about it after the Annual Examinations. Although I don\u2019t care much about becoming an official, my old man and Second Mother have pinned their hopes on me after all.\u2019***Three days later, the Eastern Mountain Institution.The sky was the color of marble white; different groups of scholars stood at the entrance of the Institution.An overwhelming number of scholars dressed in grayish-white, white or green long robes gathered in front of the entrance to the Institution. A buzz of conversations arose as they discussed what might potentially appear in the Examinations.Quite a number of horse carriages was parked sparsely among the crowd. Some stopped by the roads, others in the corners. The curtains of the horse carriages were pulled apart, revealing the young and old faces within.Some of them were family members who were waiting for the students. However, most were sons of wealthy and illustrious families who felt it beneath them to stand outside, alongside the ordinary scholars of poorer backgrounds. Thus, they sat waiting within the carriages to rest and revise.Lu Sheng was dressed in moon-white long robes with a tall black hat perched atop his head, which reminded one of the Brocade Guards. It covered his entire scalp, such that one could only vaguely make out that he was bald if one looked from the side of his temples.Alone, he stood by the side of the Institution entrance. Borrowing the shade, he spoke not a word as he closed his eyes to rest and quietly await the beginning of the Examinations.Very soon, another white horse carriage slowly made its way over. There were two people aboard; one was a potbellied fatso in yellow clothing, while the other was a pretty lass with a lithe figure.When the two of them alighted, they scanned the surroundings to seek out familiar faces.That fatso glanced around before his eyes fell onto Lu Sheng standing in a corner. His eyes lit up.\u201cBrother Sheng!!!\u201d Fatso raised his hands and hollered, scrambling over excitedly.\u201cZheng Xiangui\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng opened his eyes helplessly and looked at the fatso hurrying over. \u201cCan you lower your voice a little, we are in a very public place. Let\u2019s preserve some face.\u201d\u201cFace my ass! I, Master Fatso, was born with this temper. Whoever can\u2019t take it can just go screw themselves!\u201d Zheng Xiangui couldn\u2019t care less. In the period that they had not met, he had begun to call himself Master Fatso.\u201cHow is it? Are you confident about it?\u201d Lu Sheng asked casually.\u201cNot bad, not bad\u2026\u201d upon hearing that, Zheng Xiangui immediately laughed dryly. He came nearer, glanced furtively, and added in a hushed, conscience-stricken tone, \u201cIt all depends on my younger sis this time round. Master Fatso\u2026 won\u2019t be able to make it\u2026\u201d\u201cHi, Brother Sheng,\u201d Zheng Xiangui\u2019s sister, Zheng Yu\u2019er, walked over and greeted obediently. She was dressed in a long women\u2019s blouse and appeared to be elegant with a slight scholarly air.\u201cOf the three subjects\u2013Confucian classics argumentation, Strategy and Military Arts\u2013which one are you most confident of?\u201d Lu Sheng asked, dumbfounded.\u201cI remembered a bit when I was a kid, but now\u2026 hehe, I\u2019ve long since forgotten them cleanly\u2026\u201d Fatso said as he laughed dryly.Lu Sheng was speechless. In his view, all he needed to do was to memorize all the important materials once to understand them, then add a bit of his own viewpoints. It was basically not a problem at all to attain such a standard, although it was difficult to be among the top ranks.However, all he intended to do was just to figure his way through and pass in order to placate his family.\u201cSeems like Brother Sheng is full of confidence,\u201d Zheng Yu\u2019er said with a smile. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tutor my brother; from the looks of it, there\u2019s no way he\u2019ll pass.\u201d\u201cOh, don\u2019t say that. It\u2019s just that there\u2019s nothing to distract me. This time round, it just so happens that Eastern Mountain Institute has been chosen as the test venue, and we don\u2019t even need to leave our homes to take the test. All we need to do is to wait for it to begin at the Institution itself. How convenient,\u201d Lu Sheng said happily.\u201cBrother Lu, long time no see,\u201d Chen Jiaorong alighted from a luxurious horse carriage. Seeing the rest of them around, he strode over to greet them.\u201cIt was really to your credit that I managed to escape unscathed previously,\u201d a pained smile appeared on his face.\u201cIt\u2019s only what I should have done, there\u2019s no need to dwell on it,\u201d Lu Sheng waved his hand. \u201cSpeaking of which, why haven\u2019t I seen Brother Zhenguo around this Annual Examinations?\u201d\u201cOh, him,\u201d Chen Jiaorong shook his head. \u201cHe was selected for the candidates\u2019 inspection and entered way earlier. I wonder what happened recently. That dude seems to have suffered some sort of agitation and had been enlightened. He\u2019s growing more and more skilled in Confucian classics and strategy; likely, he\u2019ll be chosen.\u201d\u201cOh? Is that so?\u201d Lu Sheng was somewhat surprised. He had thought that, after Jun\u2019er\u2019s incident, Song Zhenguo would be in extremely low spirits. Unexpectedly, he had picked himself up after all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0KurisuAs they talked, Lu Sheng introduced Zheng Xiangui to Chen Jiaorong, but the latter was obviously not very interested in the Zheng Family.In his eyes, someone like the son of a local tycoon in a fringe city wasn\u2019t even qualified to enter his social circle.That applied even to Lu Sheng. Had it not been for his sister\u2019s constant boasting about Lu Sheng, he really wouldn\u2019t have given a hoot about who this person was.But things were different now, of course. Lu Sheng had saved his life. Thereafter, he had asked around; all said that they had seen the pleasure boat light up in raging flames and could see the fire even from several miles away.After learning about what had happened, he broke up in cold sweat all over his body. As a result, up till now, he still dared not board any boats. Looks like he was really traumatized\u2026After learning about the other person\u2019s status, Zheng Xiangui was clearly eager to curry favor with him. Neither Zheng Yu\u2019er nor Lu Sheng could stand to see it, yet they knew that this was his character. In his own words, \u201ca true man knows when to play it hard and when to play it soft.\u201dAs the conversation went on, Lu Sheng gradually spoke less and listened more, replying only occasionally. Everyone knew that this was his personality and so wasn\u2019t bothered by it.While listening, Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze casually swept across the crowd. Suddenly, his gaze was fixed on an old beggar huddling in the corner.This old beggar was clearly behaving differently from others. Despite being in the heat of summer, this was the Eastern Mountain Institution, located at the foot of the Eastern Mountain and thus was wet and cold all year round, even at the height of summer. It was extremely humid.But this old beggar was different from the norm. He had placed an old cotton jacket beside him and put on only a torn and tattered thin garment. There he sat on the cold freezing ground, content to leave his cotton jacket beside him instead of putting it on.Furthermore, Lu Sheng could even see the fine beads of sweat covering the beggar\u2019s forehead from where he was. He was mumbling something faintly in his mouth, his eyes dazed.Lu Sheng scrutinized the beggar. Suddenly, a strange feeling possessed him. It was as if\u2026 as if this beggar was very much like him.\u2018He\u2019s got to be at least in his sixties or seventies, and looks completely different from me in terms of both his physique and look. Why would I think that we\u2019re alike?\u2019 Lu Sheng mused. While Chen Jiaorong was getting interested in Zheng Yu\u2019er and starting to chat with her, he slowly stepped towards that old beggar.That was his style\u2013if something came to his mind, he would act on it. Without hesitation.Walking up to the beggar, Lu Sheng\u2019s shadow fell on more than half of the beggar\u2019s body. \u201cOld man, it\u2019s so cold here and yet you\u2019re dressed so thinly. Are you very warm?\u201dThat old beggar lifted his head and looked at him, his eyes murky and dark. \u201cWarm\u2026 warm\u2026 it\u2019s not warm? Is it warm? It\u2019s not warm? Is it warm\u2026\u201d he started mumbling, looking out of sorts.Lu Sheng frowned, shook his head and was about to walk away.\u201cYou\u2019ve seen ghosts!!!\u201d Without warning, the old beggar\u2019s voice suddenly rose in volume. \u201cOh, Body of Half-Yin, Body of Half-Yin\u2026 I also have a Body of Half-Yin. I\u2019ve seen many ghosts\u2026 even been possessed\u2026 You\u2019re like me\u2026 like me\u2026\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 Hahahah\u2026.\u201d the old beggar started laughing like a fool.\u201cBody of Half-Yin?\u201d Lu Sheng paused in shock and sized up the old beggar carefully.Given this man\u2019s clothes and dressing, one could judge that he had been rather well-off in the past. Even if he weren\u2019t wealthy, he\u2019d at least have come from a middle-class family. How did he land up in this state?\u201cWhat\u2019s the Body of Half-Yin?\u201d Lu Sheng asked. His curiosity was piqued.The old beggar paused, then started to mumble away. After a long while, the murkiness in his eyes finally cleared slightly and he seemed to turn a little more sober. Carefully, he looked at Lu Sheng and said, his voice trailing off every now and then, \u201cYou\u2019re like me\u2026 we\u2019re both Bodies of Half-Yin\u2026 those who\u2019ve been possessed by ghosts when they were young, or who\u2019ve seen many ghosts\u2026 are all of such a body\u2026 will die\u2026 attract ghosts\u2026 will die\u2026\u201dLu Sheng tried to make out what he could but remained puzzled. Looking at this old beggar, he just couldn\u2019t shake off the feeling of familiarity and affinity he shared with him. It wasn\u2019t about the looks; but rather, it was something deep within them that resembled each other.\u2018Could it really be the body nature that this old beggar mentioned? Body of Half-Yin?\u2019 He mused in his mind.\u201cHehehe\u2026 \u2026\u201d just then, the old beggar cracked up in laughter like a fool, with a finger pointed at Lu Sheng. \u201cHalf-Yin\u2026 attract ghosts\u2026 Half-Yin\u2026 Half-Yin\u2026\u201d he began repeating these two words incessantly.Lu Sheng frowned and continued with a few more questions. But the old beggar would only repeat the two words \u201cHalf-Yin\u201d. And then said nothing else.\u201cDANG\u2026!\u201dAdmission to the examination began.Helpless, Lu Sheng could only turn around and head for the entrance of the institution.The examination was officially starting.The Annual Examinations comprised of a series of three examinations. Eating, drinking and taking care of toilet needs were all done in the examination venue. Leaving the premises was strictly forbidden. When Lu Sheng finally ended his examinations and exited, it was already in the afternoon of the next day.A group of exhausted candidates stumbled out of the Institution\u2019s entrance.Lu Sheng, on the other hand, looked no different from usual. As a top expert who cultivated both inner and outer force simultaneously, this little bit of exhaustion had no effect on him.Once he exited the premises, he immediately looked towards the spot where the old beggar had been. As expected, he was gone.\u2018Body of Half-Yin\u2026\u2019 the term kept echoing in his mind. \u2018If the old beggar\u2019s words were true, and the supposed Body of Half-Yin referred to people who have had many encounters with ghosts, then I\u2019m really of such a body.\u2019After giving it some careful thought, he decided to look for someone whom he could ask about it.\u2018What kinds of people are the most likely to meet a lot of ghosts?\u2019 Lu Sheng\u2019s mind spun. Before long, a place came to his mind.Just then, Zheng Xiangui and the rest came out too. Each one of them was glum-faced and looked as if the world owed them a million dollars. Clearly, the questions this year were very challenging.It was the same for Chen Jiaorong, who walked out with a frown. Chen Yunxi walked out beside him, but quickly hid herself behind her brother\u2019s back the moment she caught sight of Lu Sheng, looking shy and coy.Lu Sheng touched the spot where his eyebrows would have been before they were burnt and smiled helplessly. He had hoped that Chen Yunxi would give up on him when she saw that his hair had been burnt up.Then, Song Zhenguo followed. Lu Sheng first chatted a little bit with Chen Jiaorong and his sister, then bade goodbye to them and went to a restaurant for dinner with the Zheng siblings and Song Zhenguo.The meal lasted till the evening. After parting ways with them, Lu Sheng traveled out of the city to a place at the foot of the mountain.A gigantic mountain range rose and fell to the left of Mountain-Edge City. Because it was shaped like deer antlers, it became known as Deer Antler Mountains.At the foot of Deer Antler Mountains lay the largest cemetery on the outskirts of the city\u2013Wan Feng Garden.Lu Sheng headed straight into Wan Feng Garden as dusk fell, and found the groundskeeper at the gate.The groundskeeper was a lame old man. His clothes were neat but tattered. A faint greenish hue colored his face, perhaps because he rarely saw sunlight, or perhaps for some other reason.\u201cBody of Half-Yin?\u201d The old man swirled the wineskin in his hand after listening to Lu Sheng\u2019s enquiry. He sized up Lu Sheng from top to toe and felt out the weight of the big copper coin he had just received.\u201cYoung lad, did you run into something \u2018unclean\u2019? There is such a theory, but most people don\u2019t call it Body of Half-Yin. The name we have for these people who\u2019ve met many ghosts is Yang Sachet.\u201d\u201cYang Sachet?\u201d Lu Sheng repeated. Then, with a frown, \u201cSo there really are such cases?\u201dThe old man looked at Lu Sheng in wonder. \u201cOf course! To be honest, this old man has lived for many years and seen many people. I\u2019ve seen many Yang Sachets too. But all of them died without living long.Young Master, looking at you, I think you should be only a recently-formed Yang Sachet. It hasn\u2019t been long, and it started because you ran into some unclean things awhile back, didn\u2019t you?\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s eyes opened in surprise. He hadn\u2019t expected this groundskeeper to be so perceptive. Nodding, he replied, \u201cThat\u2019s right. I met some unclean stuff just recently. Sir, may I know if these Yang Sachets will meet with any sort of trouble?\u201d\u201cNo idea\u2026 but I hear that Yang Sachets are magnets for ghosts. So, none of them live very long. But of course that\u2019s just a theory. Just take it with a pinch of salt. Life still has to go on,\u201d the old man waved his hand. \u201cWhen you go back, engage a Taoist priest, perform the rites and have the evil purged. That should work.\u201d\u2018Engage a priest?\u2019 Lu Sheng shook his head inwardly. He had sought out those supposed priests in several temples around the city only to find that they were all frauds without any real skills.If even such priests could capture ghosts, then he too would have been able to kill countless Demonic Ghosts with a slap of his palm.\u201cAre there any other methods, sir?\u201d Lu Sheng frowned and asked again. He wanted to find out if ordinary mortals without his martial arts capabilities could find any self-preservation methods. The groundskeeper chuckled and threw a ghastly look at Lu Sheng,\u201cMethods\u2026? Well, there is one indeed. Since Young Master was so generous with your coins, let this old man give you some directions.\u201d\u201cWhat directions?\u201dThe groundskeeper chuckled, then took a swig of his cheap wine. The smell of alcohol drifted out as he opened his mouth to speak, \u201cIn this Mountain-Edge City, there\u2019re one sect, two societies and three clans. A nephew of mine once entered the sect\u2013the Crimson Whale Sect. A pity he was embroiled in a conflict and died. But still, the connections remained.\u201dFinishing, he looked at Lu Sheng with a face of anticipation, clearly waiting for him to demonstrate his sincerity.Lu Sheng had come to Mountain-Edge City for a while, yet this was the first time he heard about the one sect, two societies and three clans. More importantly, when he heard the name \u201cCrimson Whale Sect\u201d, his heart skipped a beat. \u2018Isn\u2019t this the Crimson Whale Sect mentioned by Duanmu Wan?\u2019Duanmu Wan was an enigma. Since she had said that Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s skills were the most powerful in the region, then she was most likely right. What he lacked now was not skills, but rather, powerful skills. The average inner force skill wasn\u2019t of much help to him anymore.At his present level, only by finding stronger skills\u2013ideally, ones that could even replace Black Fury Skill\u2013can he continue to raise his strength without Yin Qi.After all, Black Fury Skill only had these few limited levels. And stuff like Yin Qi\u2026 seemed like it had its own side effects too if one absorbed too much of it.\u201cBut sir, how is it that I\u2019ve never heard of the Crimson Whale Sect even though I\u2019ve come to Mountain-Edge City for such a long time? You aren\u2019t trying to fool me, are you?\u201d Lu Sheng countered with a question.The groundskeeper laughed deviously. \u201cThey\u2019re an underground faction. What\u2019s the meaning of \u2018underground\u2019? Basically, what you can\u2019t see with your eyes\u2026 that\u2019s \u2018underground\u2019. Their shadow lies behind all the brothels, black markets and ghost markets in Mountain-Edge City, along every street and every district. Young Master, one look at you shows that you\u2019re not lacking in money. Perhaps that\u2019s why you\u2019ve never noticed them in the past. But it\u2019s a different story for the average person. Thefts, robberies, loansharking, extorting money, homicides, scams\u2026 all sorts of mess and troubles are related to them.\u201dRealization dawned on Lu Sheng. This Crimson Whale Sect was essentially an underground organization. A mafia, but well-hidden.He pondered over it, then took out a piece of silver for the old man as thanks.\u201cGood fine Young Master!\u201d The old man grinned from ear to ear. \u201cCrimson Whale Sect is filled with experts. Rumor has it that they\u2019re a massive organization that\u2019s an ally of the yamen in maintaining Mountain-Edge City\u2019s security. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s someone in it who can solve Young Master\u2019s problem.\u201dBut Lu Sheng wasn\u2019t bothered with that. What he desired was more powerful skills. If he could find a way into Crimson Whale Sect, then perhaps he could acquire skills more powerful than Black Fury Skill.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A wooden platform had been built there and a man was hawking on it, attracting many passers-by and onlookers.Lu Sheng glanced at them and was about to leave without further ado.However, as he passed by the wooden platform, he couldn\u2019t help but notice many among the crowd who were dressed in rags and looked like bags of bones.\u2018The people of Mountain-Edge City have always been quite well-to-do. I\u2019ve never seen so many refugees walking along the streets before either. Where did these folks come from?\u2019Ignoring the merchant who was blabbering on loudly on the wooden platform, Lu Sheng examined these refugee-like people closely.Their faces were the picture of hardship, their eyes devoid of any glimmer of hope. Standing by the wooden platform, they merely wished that the store would give them something to stave off the hunger.Lu Sheng walked on for a slight distance and heard another crowd gathering in the area to the right before him. The gathering crowd was engrossed in chat, discussing something animatedly.Approaching, Lu Sheng pushed his way through the crowd for a look.It was an emaciated couple, their clothes hardly enough to cover them. A little girl, only three or four years old, was in their arms. They were kneeling on the ground, with a piece of bark hanging from their necks. On the piece of bark was a simple picture sketched crookedly with charcoal. It was the picture of a string of coins.\u201cPlease do some good\u2026 my daughter\u2019s only three years old this year. She\u2019s obedient and pretty. Please, may some kind soul have some pity on us and give us a mouthful of food\u2026\u201d the woman kneeling on the ground cried.The girl stood up beside her with a blank face, as if she had no idea what was going on around her.Lu Sheng frowned and squeezed his way out of the crowd. Walking yet further, he again saw some who were selling their daughter or son\u2013all very young children.\u2018Where did all these refugees in the city come from?\u2019 Lu Sheng mumbled to himself.As he strolled, he continued to come across at least five families who were selling their children. This weighed heavily on his heart and caused even greater puzzlement in his mind.After all, he had never seen such tragic sights before he had landed up in this world. What sorry straits must a family have landed in to resort to having to sell their son or daughter?After some time, Lu Sheng returned to the building where his apartment was in. Even on the first floor outside the winery, a young lady was kneeling on the ground, selling herself. Speaking in a foreign accent, she was finding it difficult to make herself understood.Lu Sheng glanced at her, then saw that the waiter from the winery was also watching the scene, and so approached him and enquired, \u201cWhy\u2019re there so many refugees in the city lately? Has some disaster happened out there?\u201dCatching sight of Lu Sheng, whom he knew was the winery\u2019s patron living upstairs, the waiter quickly bowed.\u201cIn response to Young Master\u2019s question, hasn\u2019t there been a great drought in Yun Province? Countless people have nothing to eat and are forced to migrate. The number of people who starved to death en route already amounts up to ten percent of Mountain-Edge City\u2019s population. It\u2019s been really tragic\u2026\u201d the waiter shook his head and sighed. \u201cI heard that we initially did not let these refugees come in. But after that, seeing how tragic and pitiful they are, the old master in the yamen softened and gave the order to admit them. Actually, the number of refugees in our city isn\u2019t considered very big. Towards the Central Plains, many cities are suffering from hyperinflation due to overcrowding by refugees.\u201d\u201cOh, Yun Province\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng knew about that place. It was the umbrella name for the whole region west of the Central Plains. But he had not expected that the drought there was so severe. For these ordinary folks to travel all the way here from such a faraway place, many of them must have died along the way.\u201cYea\u2026 rumor has it\u2026\u201d the waiter looked left and right, then continued in a hushed voice, \u201cRumor has it that demons and devils had wreaked havoc in Yun Province. Look at the weather. Since when has there ever been ten days of hail, followed by several months of severe drought?\u201d\u201cTen days of hail? Several months of severe drought?\u201d Lu Sheng was puzzled.\u201cI heard that the hail was the size of eggs! After that was eight or nine months of great drought. Not a single drop of rain fell\u2026 tsk, tsk\u2026 it\u2019s really tragic. According to rumors, some people even turned into cannibals,\u201d the waiter was truly a talkative one; he couldn\u2019t help saying everything he knew.\u201cHail the size of eggs\u2026 eight or nine months of great drought\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng was alarmed. In the world that he knew, even a mere continuous three-month period without rain was considered a drought. Yet the drought in Yun province persisted for eight to nine months! It was little wonder that the entire Yun Province had collapsed. All crops had probably died out, and even drinking water must have been scarce.\u201cAccording to the hearsay, every time it was about to rain, even when dark clouds had gathered in the sky, something strange would happen immediately\u2026 like a whirlpool in the air or thunder\u2026 and then the dark clouds which had only just appeared would vanish in a poof,\u201d the waiter continued softly.After hearing the news, Lu Sheng went back up to his apartment, still full of astonishment.Ten days of hail followed close after by drought. Such illogical weather was completely out of conformity with the laws of nature.Having been in this world for such a long time, Lu Sheng had already understood that this place wasn\u2019t too different from ancient China. Apart from some differences in culture, there weren\u2019t many differences in the laws of nature.Except for supernatural phenomena related to demons, devils, ghosts and monsters.\u2018Such unnatural weather that defies the laws of nature must have been induced by some power,\u2019 Lu Sheng guessed. His instinct told him that the drought was most probably related to the supernatural.Back in his apartment, Little Qiao was doing some sewing. Seeing Lu Sheng, she quickly rose.\u201cYoung Master, you\u2019re back? Would you like to take a bath? Little Qiao will go heat up the water.\u201d\u201cNo need. How much money do we have left?\u201d Lu Sheng asked casually.\u201cAbout twenty one taels,\u201d Little Qiao quickly replied, answering with a pathetic figure.Lu Sheng was speechless. He even thought of borrowing from Song Zhenguo or Chen Jiaorong. Or perhaps selling the white jade chimera from Chen Jiaorong\u2013that was a priceless treasure and would fetch a handsome sum. And there was that purple jade hairpin too. The Yin Qi on it had been absorbed by him, but it was made of purple jade, which also cost a hefty price.\u2018But these are merely stop-gap measures. Best to follow my earlier idea. Perhaps I can even establish some foundations here in Mountain-Edge City for my Lu Family,\u201d Lu Sheng plotted in his mind as he dug in into the dishes served by Little Qiao.The dishes had all been bought from the restaurant beside them and were pretty tasty. Little Qiao stood beside Lu Sheng, pouring wine for him and chatting with him occasionally.\u201cHow long before the results will be released?\u201d Lu Sheng asked.\u201cApproximately a month later. By that time, the Institution should release a notice. Qiao\u2019er will watch out for it,\u201d Little Qiao quickly replied.\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t let it slip your mind. During this period, I may have to attend to some matters. Be careful when you\u2019re alone at home. With the influx of these refugees, there\u2019re bound to be some with shady motives among them.\u201d\u201cQiao\u2019er understands,\u201d Little Qiao replied obediently.After the meal, Lu Sheng went out again. He had already checked out the locations of Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s bases in the morning.Noon passed. All that was left was the issue of how he would get into the sect.Lu Sheng hailed and boarded a horse carriage leisurely, then took his time to arrive at a casino.Golden Seal Casino.A tacky name, but apt nonetheless. The entire entrance to the casino looked like a giant golden seal\u2013square-shaped and very eye-catching.Lu Sheng alighted, took out a pretentious gold-threaded folding fan and opened it with a flourish. Slowly, he walked into the casino among the crowd.Once he entered the casino, he was immediately assaulted by the chaotic din and revelry of gamblers. Large and small, gambling tables filled the hall, each of them surrounded by gangs of gamblers. Caught in a frenzy, the gamblers yelled as if their winnings depended on it.Being indifferent about gambling, Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze merely swept across them, then landed on a ruddy-faced middle-aged man standing in the deepest end of the casino.This man stood by the furthest table from the entrance, watching the lively din in the casino expressionlessly. He was dressed no differently from the bouncers all around the casino.But Lu Sheng knew that this was in fact the ringleader of Golden Seal Casino who oversaw its premises. If one wanted to join the Crimson Whale Sect, he was the go-to guy.He slowly approached the ruddy-faced Zhao Jie, who very quickly noticed his approach and looked at him with eyes of surprise.\u201cBrother, why have you come to this corner instead of joining in the fun?\u201d Zhao Jie asked casually. Though he was leaning on a table, no game was being played here and it was presently used merely as an ordinary table.\u201cI\u2019m a student of the Eastern Mountain Institution and would like to enlist in Crimson Whale Sect. Can you make a referral?\u201d Lu Sheng stated his purpose straightforwardly, with a smile.\u201cA student of the Eastern Mountain Institution?\u201d Zhao Jie was taken aback.He had been in the sect for so many years, yet it was the first time he encountered a student of the Institution who desired to join Crimson Whale Sect.Despite the fact that Crimson Whale Sect was the number one sect, students of the Institution had always thought themselves holier-than-thou. Except for those among the upper echelons who joined through special connections, or those who had been coerced into joining due to some special circumstances, there wasn\u2019t really any scholar in the sect who had joined voluntarily.After all, these scholars always set their hearts on becoming court officials. They weren\u2019t the sort who would let themselves be tied down by a sect.After coming out from his daze, Zhao Jie sized Lu Sheng up from top to toe.\u201cMister, you claim to be a student of the Institution. Do you have any proof?\u201dLu Sheng smiled as he took out his Institution-issued nameplate. On it was his last name and the name and the logo of his Institution.It was a giant word \u201cEast\u201d. Underneath it was the small word \u201cLu\u201d. The nameplate was made of yellow bronze and was rather weighty. There were even intricate floral patterns carved onto it, making it very difficult to counterfeit.Upon seeing the nameplate, Zhao Jie was convinced. No Tom, Dick or Harry could lay his hands on a nameplate like this; even trying to forge one was extremely difficult. None of the craftsmen in the city took on private jobs. Moreover, it was a severe crime, punishable by execution, for craftsmen to manufacture it illegally.\u201cWhy do you want to join us?\u201d Zhao Jie asked. Those who wanted to enlist in the sect were mostly the underdogs of the society, merchants or craftsmen with certain skills. People who were clearly Institution students from well-off families, like the one standing before him, really had no need to join sects.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that Crimson Whale Sect is the number one sect in all of the northern lands, that experts fill its ranks, and that it boasts of the most powerful martial arts skills. I want to practice the best skills, and so hope to join,\u201d Lu Sheng explained his motives without concealing. He didn\u2019t bother to beat around the bush.\u201cOh, martial arts skills\u2026\u201d Zhao Jie finally understood. Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s skills were indeed the strongest in all of the northern lands. None of the rest, whether they were societies or clans, could compare with it.\u201cAlright, then. Please come with me to register your name, age and expertise,\u201d without further ado, he pointed at a small door on the right for Lu Sheng. \u201cBut let me remind you first\u2013all disciples of our sect who wish to learn martial arts must obtain them from the Martial Proclamation Library. And to gain admittance to the Martial Proclamation Library, we must assess the level of your strength and your contribution to the sect.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Kurisu\u201cThat I understand. There\u2019s no free meal in this world,\u201d Lu Sheng nodded. The reason why he wanted to join Crimson Whale Sect via the standard procedure was precisely so that he could establish a foundation in Mountain-Edge City for his family while also earning some income. Moreover, he could also secure some protection and build up connections. Naturally, his eventual goal was to obtain combat inner force skills with damage greater than Black Fury Skill\u2019s.Zhao Jie gave a basic introduction of Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s rules. It was very simple, there were only three rules\u2013no disloyalty to the sect; no divulging of the sect secrets; obey orders at all times.\u201cAs long as you keep to these three rules and have not been kicked out of the sect, then you will receive a fixed monthly allowance and enjoy discounts in most stores in the city. On top of that, when you run into trouble, the sect will be your greatest backing,\u201d Zhao Jie smiled warmly.\u201cJust a few days ago, our External Affairs Emissary had just exchanged opinions with the city\u2019s Deputy Commander, Official Jiang, regarding the handling of Mountain-Edge City\u2019s refugees. Just our External Affairs Emissary alone already possesses the authority to negotiate with the city\u2019s top authorities. Not to mention that there\u2019re many elders of equal rank as him, as well as the Deputy Sect Masters and Sect Master above him.\u201dPatiently, he revealed some of Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s organizational hierarchy to Lu Sheng. After all, Lu Sheng was dressed prestigiously and carried with him an extraordinary bearing. Not to mention that he was a student of the Institution to boot. Very likely, he would attain a prominent position in the sect in the future. Building a relationship with him now was an investment that might reap benefits in the future.Lu Sheng understood as well that, these years, literate ones like himself who joined sects were usually high-class intellectuals and management talents. Even if he knew no martial arts, he would be able to hold his own in the sect and at least earn his keep easily. Hence, he understood Zhao Jie\u2019s friendly attitude towards him.Entering a side room, Lu Sheng registered. He was not asked if he had any criminal record or what was his family background. All they looked at was his name, age and expertise; everything else was unnecessary. In the blink of an eye, Lu Sheng had become an ordinary One-Fish sect member of Crimson Whale Sect.After a person joined Crimson Whale Sect as a sect member, he needed to perform services for the sect to earn contribution merit records. Ordinary sect members could go on patrol duties, collect protection fees, catch thieves, assist the authorities in investigating human traffickers and the like to gain contribution records. There was also an agency headed by Internal Affairs Emissaries which would confirm and verify the sect members\u2019 services rendered and award them with the corresponding contribution grade.After familiarizing himself with Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s systems, Lu Sheng was rather surprised that such a sect was under such detailed and strict management. Moreover, looking at the missions to be performed, Crimson Whale Sect wasn\u2019t really a mafia. Strictly speaking, it should be considered a civil organization in the gray area with extremely close links with the yamen authorities.After the registration was completed, Zhao Jie led him out of the casino through a backdoor, his face all smiles as if he was hoping to establish some connections with Lu Sheng. They entered a small courtyard surrounded by white walls.\u201cHere lives Old Master Xiao who\u2019s in charge of the premises. He\u2019s the one who assesses the enlisting sect members and determines the level of their skills. After going through this procedure, you\u2019ll be given a position depending on the level of your skills.\u201dLu Sheng nodded with a smile.\u201cI was just getting eager to experience the skills of the sect\u2019s experts.\u201d\u201cHas Brother Lu practiced any martial arts before?\u201d Zhao Jie asked as he walked along.\u201cI\u2019ve practiced some martial arts imparted by the martial arts teachers back at home; but none of them are really strong,\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head with a smile.\u201cOld Master Xiao\u2019s Sword of Wind and Thunder can be ranked among the top thirty-six skills in the sect! Our Crimson Whale Sect is more than ten thousand members strong. To be able to rank among the top thirty-six among so many experts, he\u2019s truly head and shoulders above the rest. Brother Lu, you\u2019re in for an eye-opener!\u201d Zhao Jie opened the courtyard gate, bragging with all his might.Right after entering through the gate, an old man\u2019s voice from within rang out, \u201cDidn\u2019t I just finish assessing a batch? Why\u2019re you here again?\u201dZhao Jie explained with a smile, \u201cThis time, Brother Lu\u2019s different from the rest. I personally made another trip, and we\u2019ve got to trouble elder Xiao to perform one more assessment.\u201d\u201cDifferent from the rest?\u201d The old man voiced his doubts in a booming voice.Lu Sheng entered the courtyard and saw a ruddy-faced elderly man clothed in gray, his white hair covering his shoulders. The elderly man stood under a peach tree, a cup of tea in his hand as he stared at him.\u201cGreetings to elder Xiao. May I know when the assessment begins?\u201d Lu Sheng clasped his hands together.\u201cSimple. Young lad, all you need to do is perform the skill you\u2019re well-versed in before this old man,\u201d seeing Lu Sheng\u2019s unusual bearing, elder Xiao spoke politely.\u201cWhat I\u2019m well versed in are palm techniques\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng thought for a while, then extended both his palms level before him. \u201cI wish to join Crimson Whale Sect in order to learn from its experts and acquire more powerful skills. I hope elder Xiao will not disappoint me\u2026\u201dDespite the smile on Lu Sheng\u2019s face as he spoke, the previously harmonious mood in the air changed in an instant.An air of vicious killing intent emanated within the courtyard.Elder Xiao\u2019s face turned solemn as he sensed something amiss. The lad\u2019s words were too bold.He looked again at Lu Sheng\u2019s current pose\u2013packed with power yet unreleased; energy gathering and accumulating within him, forming an unending cycle; stable and controlled.Astonishment flooded his face immediately. \u201cStrength Proficiency expert?!\u201d\u201cStrength Proficiency?\u201d To the side, Zhao Jie was stunned too. \u2018How old is this Young Master? How can he already be a Strength Proficiency expert?\u2019Even a top-notch sect like Crimson Whale Sect couldn\u2019t boast of many Strength Proficiency experts. Finding a hundred of them out of ten thousand members was already a very good number.Such experts usually constituted central pillars of the fighting forces stationed in some small cities. Even in the Mountain-Edge City headquarters, they were considered cream of the crop.Lu Sheng smiled. His pushed his right palm forward slowly.\u201cHOO\u2026\u201dA raw, bloody aura rose in the entire courtyard, as if an extremely ferocious and lethal beast had been let loose.Goosebumps appeared all over Zhao Jie and elder Xiao. Their hearts were shaken to the core.\u201cThat\u2019s Intent Proficiency!!!\u201d The teacup in elder Xiao\u2019s hand dropped on the ground with a clang as he stared dumbfounded at Lu Sheng.\u201cYou, you, you\u2026 how old are you?! Oh my goodness\u2026\u201dHe choked on his words, speechless. With a face flushed red, he paced on the spot in disbelief.Zhao Jie came to his senses and hurried over to pat elder Xiao on his back. Only after a good few seconds did he catch his breath.\u201cMay I know how my skills fare among the sect\u2019s standards?\u201d Lu Sheng enquired smilingly.In actuality, his strength had far surpassed Intent Proficiency. In fact, he was confident that he would not lose even to the famed Spirit Focus experts who were a cut above the Intent Proficiency level.But there was no need for him to reveal too many of his cards here. Just the Intent Proficiency level alone was sufficient for him to gain the recognition he desired; any more would have been an overkill and would put himself under too much exposure for his comfort.Even then, however, elder Xiao looked as if he had aged significantly in a heartbeat. A look of haggardness came upon him as he stared at Lu Sheng with envy.\u201cI, old Xiao\u2026 entered Strength Proficiency after thirty years of hard work\u2026 and then arrived at pinnacle of Strength Proficiency only after forty years\u2026 only to find that\u2026\u201d unable to carry on, he sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll inform the headquarters immediately. Regarding Young Brother Lu\u2019s position, it\u2019s simply above my pay grade.\u201dSwiftly, he entered the house. Not long later, a black pigeon flew out and shot towards the distance.Now, Zhao Jie no longer looked at Lu Sheng with friendliness. Rather, he carried a hint of reverence in his eyes.He ran into the house and brought out a chair for Lu Sheng to sit on. Then, hurriedly, he served him tea and accompanied him by his side.After elder Xiao came out, he glanced at Lu Sheng once more, only to find his own heart sinking further.\u2018A twenty year-old Intent Proficiency expert. Such talent\u2026 it\u2019s completely\u2026\u2019 he felt as if he would lose a year from his lifespan with every second he remained in Lu Sheng\u2019s presence.Compared to him, he was an old fogy who had wasted his whole life, hardly even able to enter Intent Proficiency.He sat dazed for a moment. Fortunately, Zhao Jie was present to chit-chat with Lu Sheng and answer his occasional questions.Very soon, people arrived outside the courtyard. The commotion of a large gang could be heard. All of them were dressed in the sect\u2019s black athletic robes and were led by two leaders.One of them was a white-haired old man with a longsword strapped to his back. The other was a beautiful but rotund middle-aged woman with two curved scimitars hanging by her waist. A white whale symbol was embroidered on both their robes.Upon entering, the old man began yelling, \u201cWho! Who\u2019s the Intent Proficiency expert!? After seeing the memo, Your Father here has been roused from his sleep! A twenty year-old Intent Proficiency practitioner!!! Your father\u2019s heavens! This joke\u2019s getting out of hand!\u201d\u201cInternal Affairs Emissary Elder Wang! Elder Ouyang!?\u201d Zhao Jie was flabbergasted at the sight of the two figures. Trembling, he and elder Xiao hurried up to salute them.\u201cDispense with the ceremonies,\u201d the pretty woman Elder Ouyang said gently, her gaze falling on Lu Sheng, who was the only one still wearing a smile.\u201cA dragon among men indeed. You must be brother Lu?\u201dLu Sheng clasped his hands together to return the greeting. \u201cI\u2019m Lu Sheng. I guess I should be the Intent Proficiency expert that you mentioned.\u201d\u201cIntent Proficiency? Are you the real deal or a phony!? Let Your Father here test you out!!!\u201d\u201cBOOM!!!\u201dAs his words still echoed in the air, the old man leapt into the air, and suddenly, an ear-piercing eagle\u2019s cry resounded in the courtyard.\u201cVery nice!\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes lit up. This was his first time meeting an Intent Proficiency expert who could, like himself, bring to life the essence and true intent of his martial arts.Without the support of Qi, Lu Sheng faced him head on with his Heart-Shattering Palm.\u201cROAR!!!\u201dEven without utilizing Qi, his moves naturally generated tiger roars because he had mastered the true intent of Black Tiger Saber Technique after attaining Intent Proficiency. The tiger roar shook the peach trees in the courtyard violently, causing their leaves to fall all over like rain.Lu Sheng\u2019s palms were dyed red. A pattern of faint blood-red veins surfaced on the area between his eyes. His body shot forward like an arrow, colliding against the old man without warning.\u201cBOOM! Boom boom boom boom boom!!!\u201dBoth of them were jolted backwards in the first collision of palms. In the very next breath, they traded five quick palms with each other at lightning speed, then parted.\u201cHahahahahah! Damn fine!!!\u201d A sense of release and exhilaration flooded Lu Sheng\u2019s heart. Apart from when he fought against ghosts, this was the first time he experienced such ecstasy when he fought a human. The fact that someone was capable of receiving his blows under full force, albeit without him using inner Qi, overwhelmed him with joy, as if he had finally discovered a kindred spirit.\u201cAgain!\u201d Lu Sheng lifted up his palm, which was a patch of blood red, about to charge forward again\u2026\u201cPUUU!!!\u201d\u2026only to see a big mouthful of blood spurting out of the old man\u2019s mouth, then him falling backwards like a log.\u201c\u2026\u201dA sea of dazed silence descended on everyone.\u201cLord Wang!!! Save him, quick!!!\u201d Being the first to react, Zhao Jie hurriedly pounced over to lift the old man up.With a solemn face, the middle-aged woman quickly walked up and took out a small vial from her sleeve. Pulling out the stopper, she emptied out a small white pill the size of a soy bean and rapidly fed it to the old man.After that, she massaged his acupoints to aid his blood circulation.The group entered a flurry of activity while Lu Sheng stood aside. Elder Xiao walked over to console him; but before the old man Wang was resuscitated, all words were in vain.He stared at Lu Sheng as if looking at a monster. Finally, he shook his head in a sigh and patted Lu Sheng on his shoulder without a word.Lu Sheng was speechless. The frenzy that had only just been sparked in him had now died out.At that moment, he finally realized what level of strength he had achieved.It wasn\u2019t the level of the famed experts as what he had guessed; perhaps he was even stronger than that\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0KurisuAt the very least, Lu Sheng had never heard of any famed expert almost killing an Intent Proficiency master in one palm strike\u2013all without the use of inner force. After all, an Intent Proficiency expert could concentrate all the body\u2019s strength together and also increase the circulation speed of Qi and blood in a very short time to result in an explosive power that vastly increased one\u2019s force and speed.An Intent Proficiency expert\u2019s might was roughly equivalent to the combined power of two experts at the peak of Strength Proficiency!After all, inner Qi could only be used to increase one\u2019s strength and speed. Therefore, although famed experts who trained in both the inner and outer forces were perhaps slightly stronger than Intent Proficiency experts, that difference wouldn\u2019t be very significant.After much effort, that old fogy, Elder Wang, was finally resuscitated. He vomited a mouthful of murky blood again as he gradually came to his senses. Under the eyes of all present, he propped himself upright with much effort and looked at Lu Sheng.\u201cBloody hell! Wasn\u2019t that Heart-Shattering Palm!? Which freak taught you this version of Heart-Shattering Palm!? Tell your father here and I promise not to beat him to death!\u201dLu Sheng was stunned.\u201cHeart-Shattering Palm\u2026 could it be the Heart-Shattering Palm passed down in Elder Wang\u2019s family???\u201d The crowd was instantly shocked into a daze.\u201cThis old man has lost all his face today!!!\u201d Elder Wang hollered. Struggling free of the surrounding people who were supporting him, he stood up. \u201cWhere did you learn this Heart-Shattering Palm? It\u2019s riddled with errors and filled with mistakes! Force was applied wrongly too! But that\u2019s not the worst\u2026 the worst thing is that you actually still managed to injure this old man so grievously in one strike! Bloody hell! Unbelievable!!!\u201dHe was frustrated and dejected at the same time. However, his eyes which were fixed on Lu Sheng grew brighter and brighter.Lu Sheng was rather speechless. The world was truly such a small place. He had learned Heart-Shattering Palm from Senior Constable Zhang Xun, but little did he imagine that it was actually this old fogy\u2019s family heirloom martial arts skill. From the expressions of those around, it seemed like this old fogy had long since made a name for this Heart-Shattering Palm with his own hands. It didn\u2019t seem fake.\u201cYou\u2019re stronger than me! By leaps and bounds!\u201d Elder Wang said in all seriousness as he pushed Zhao Jie, who was trying to support him, aside. \u201cI can\u2019t teach you, but my Big Bro definitely can! My Big Bro, he\u2026 he definitely can! With your innate talent and Big Bro\u2019s strength added together! Perhaps there will be a way, a hope!\u201dLu Sheng could not make head nor tail of what he had just heard.The surrounding crowd also seemed lost and could not understand what they were hearing. Only that middle-aged woman\u2019s eyes flashed as she seemed to understand the meaning of Elder Wang\u2019s words.\u201cJunior Brother, are you willing to be a member of my Crimson Whale Sect?\u201d Elder Wang asked as he neared Lu Sheng. Abruptly, he smacked his own forehead. \u201cAh that\u2019s right, I forgot. You were here to join the Sect!\u201d\u201cElder Wang\u2026 you should head back to rest, leave the matters here to me,\u201d the pretty woman said gently.\u201cThat\u2019s good too. Ningzhi, I shall hand this fella into your hands for now,\u201d Elder Wang himself knew that he couldn\u2019t delay treating his injuries for long and needed to head back to cultivate and recuperate his body.All this while, Lu Sheng had not had the chance to speak. Before he could do anything else, a group of people hastily escorted Elder Wang away. Elder Ouyang and another group of people remained.Each of the people in this group looked at him in the same obscure manner as Zhao Jie and elder Xiao, all trying to size him up.\u201cJunior Brother Lu, why don\u2019t we head into the house to sit and chat?\u201d elder Xiao suggested.\u201cOkay,\u201d only now did Lu Sheng heave a sigh of relief.He wasn\u2019t afraid of offending anybody, but he feared accidentally killing an old man whom he had no grudge or grievance against. If he had made an enemy of Crimson Whale Sect because of that, that would have been a great blunder.Seeing that Lu Sheng was in agreement, elder Xiao also went to the middle-aged woman for her instructions. After receiving permission, he led the two of them into the house. Only the three of them went in; people like Zhao Jie were not qualified to be in the know.As the three of them entered the house, both Elder Ouyang and Lu Sheng sat down, while elder Xiao stood by the side and listened on.Ouyang Ningzhi looked youthful, as if she was in her thirties. In reality, however, she was already past fifty years old. Her long legs were smooth and round, and she crossed and slightly tilted them to the side. Her chest was plump and full and as she sat on the seat, her waist and back upright. Her fine figure was graceful and she was modestly attractive. There was a certain dignified and elegant air about her.\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, Brother Lu\u2019s prowess is indeed extraordinary. The most suitable position for you within the Sect should be the position of External Affairs Emissary. However, it is not within my power to appoint someone to such a role; I can only report to the Sect Master and wait for all the Elders to convene and discuss the matter before we can confirm it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s alright,\u201d Lu Sheng smiled. \u201cThe reason I joined Crimson Whale Sect is to learn and exchange for even more powerful martial arts. The position itself doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to powerful martial arts, our Sect is second to none in the entire Nothern area. The Sect Master is also widely known as the number one swordsman in the North. If you want to seek the most powerful martial arts, then our Crimson Whale Sect is happy to oblige. Even the authorities and the yamen cannot hold a candle to us,\u201d Ouyang Ningzhi was all smiles as she continued.Elder Xiao, who was standing by the side, also chipped in to explain, \u201cOur Sect Master\u2019s reputation is unparalleled in all of the North. Even the Chief Army Commander of the Mountain-Edge City would have to call himself a junior before our Sect Master.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Lu Sheng was somewhat astounded at that piece of information. Although the government\u2019s yamen was rather useless, it had after all established itself in this world for such an extended period. Surely, it must have had its merits. For the chief of a sect to be on equal footing with a head official clearly implied that Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s background was definitely not that simple.\u201cPresently, supernatural ghosts are causing all sorts of problems and the ordinary folk have no means of getting by. Many of our Sect\u2019s Elders have gone out to assist the government in managing the issues in the districts, so the position of an External Affairs Emissary may not be approved anytime soon. For now, I will raise junior brother Lu\u2019s rank to that of Nine-Fish; I hope you will understand, young man,\u201d Ouyang Ningzhi said smilingly.\u201cNo problem. As long as the benefits remain the same, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Lu Sheng laughed. Then, he asked again, \u201cI wonder what sorts of contributions will earn me the right to enter the Sect\u2019s Martial Proclamation Library?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a section that contains ordinary level martial arts within Martial Proclamation Library that is accessible to all, and free for those of Five-Fish level and above. As for those of Nine-Fish status, all martial arts of the Strength Proficiency level are available to browse freely. Anyone who has entered the Strength Proficiency realm can access everything, be it inner or outer force, for free,\u201d Ouyang Ningzhi replied seriously.\u201cEven Strength Proficiency levels?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes lit up.The Strength Proficiency level was what he had achieved with the Black Tiger Saber Technique. Actually, when training Black Tiger Saber according to the secret manual, the highest level one could attain is Strength Proficiency. Achieving any Intent Proficiency that followed in that technique would have to depend on one\u2019s own enlightenment.Lu Sheng was a case in point. After receiving advice from Zhang Xun, he was able to arrive at his own understanding.In reality, on top of Strength Proficiency, there were also Intent Proficiency secret manuals. These were extremely rare and precious manuals that detailed the specific steps and instructions for achieving Intent Proficiency.\u201cAs for the higher levels, including seeking advice from Sect experts, that would cost you contribution points,\u201d Ouyang Ningzhi smiled as she added.After that, she and elder Xiao shared with Lu Sheng some general knowledge regarding the Crimson Whale Sect.For example, the logos on the sect members\u2019 clothing. Ordinary sect members, be they small or big leaders, were all denoted in rank by the number of fish depicted on their clothing. It ranged from one to nine, Nine-Fish being the highest.After that were the white whale logos, which were used by the elders and the Inner and Outer Affairs Emissaries. Even higher up was the double white whale, which was the exclusive logo for the Deputy Sect Masters.Lastly, the crimson whale represented the Sect Master.After chatting for a while more, it was late afternoon and evening was fast approaching. Ouyang Ningzhi was the first to take her leave.Then, elder Xiao and Zhao Jie invited Lu Sheng to a nearby restaurant, where they held a massive banquet to celebrate his joining the Sect.After a merry drinking session, elder Xiao sat on his seat and let out a long sigh. \u201cHonestly speaking, this world is fraught with dangers at every corner. Even within our Sect, the number of casualties is sky-high\u2013that\u2019s why experts are in great demand.\u201d\u201cNumber of casualties is sky-high? What does elder Xiao mean by that?\u201d Lu Sheng asked, puzzled. Although he could hazard some guesses, he did not voice them.Elder Xiao smiled bitterly, \u201cPerhaps Junior Brother Lu is not in the know\u2026 although this Mountain-Edge City seems peaceful and prosperous on the surface, countless dangers, threats and menaces are being defused and neutralized each day in the shadows. We, the Crimson Whale Sect, are but one of the powers handling these affairs. Or perhaps, the chief power.Otherwise, why do you think the government has been tolerating the existence of so many sects?\u201dLu Sheng narrowed his eyes, somewhat taken aback by the other party\u2019s frankness. \u201cDangers? What dangers could Mountain-Edge City have?\u201dZhao Jie, who was sitting at the side, could hold it in no longer. Interrupting, he said, \u201cBrother Lu, forgive me for overreaching myself\u2013do you mind if I call you brother?\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Lu Sheng waved his hand and smiled.Zhao Jie continued with a helpless face, \u201cYou don\u2019t know how dangerous it is in this world. Each day, more than ten people pass through my hands to join the sect. Over ten people a day, which makes up three to four thousand people in the three hundred plus days that make a year! With so many people, how is it there there are only tens of thousands of people in the sect after so many years?Where did the rest of the people go? Some are dead, the others are crippled!\u201d\u201cAbout the situation Zhao Jie is talking about\u2026 we Crimson Whale Sect are already considered to be faring pretty well. At the very least, if you are unable to work, you can still enjoy welfare benefits. The other sects and clans have it much worse\u2026\u201d elder Xiao sighed.The light swayed gently inside the room. In that moment, none of them spoke.Lu Sheng kept silent for a period before slowly asking, \u201cAs for these dangers, they\u2019re referring to\u2026?\u201d\u201cNothing taboo,\u201d elder Xiao waved his hand. \u201cWhat we manage are largely human affairs, including catching criminals such as murderers, arsonists, robbers and rapists. Then there are also those who fight with us over territories and resources, as well as our long-standing adversaries. All these are considered human affairs.Occasionally, we would encounter Black Calamities as well, which are some eccentric or strange occurrences. For example, a while ago, the second daughter of Squire Wang disappeared without a trace in the middle of night. When she was finally found, she was lying down next to a willow tree along the Cypress Pine Lake outside of the city, with black hair growing all over her skin. If I didn\u2019t witness this with my own eyes, I wouldn\u2019t believe it even if it came from my own mouth.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 is this real?\u201d Zhao Jie was shocked.\u201cYes, as real as it gets. I saw that girl with my own eyes; about only eleven or twelve years of age, she was covered in long hair all over her body. Even her clothes couldn\u2019t cover them. Subsequently, Squire Wang came to our sect. It was the External Affairs Emissary Lord Li who personally killed the girl. Apparently, the night he did it, loud booms resounded in the entire courtyard like wild thunder,\u201d elder Xiao said ruefully.\u201cBlack Calamities\u2026 do these things happen often?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes narrowed as he understood that this was how the Crimson Whale Sect referred to all matters concerning the supernatural.\u201cNot many. But it occurs once every few months, and sometimes more frequently. Basically, if we don\u2019t pay it any heed, it would disappear by itself. As for those that do not disappear, they won\u2019t spread beyond one area\u2013these will stay confined to the small area where they first appeared. As long as we avoid such an area, it\u2019s safe,\u201d elder Xiao explained.Lu Sheng nodded as he understood how the ordinary folk dealt with supernatural matters.\u201cSpeaking of which, a curious incident happened in the vicinity recently, has Brother Lu heard of it?\u201d Zhao Jie interrupted.\u201cWhat curious incident?\u201d Lu Sheng asked.His brows furrowing ever so slightly, Zhao Jie whispered, \u201cPreviously, a scholar who lived nearby by the name of Wang Ziquan or something seemed to have mysteriously disappeared after he made a trip to the pleasure boat in the middle of the night. He never came back. It was quite a sensational matter when it happened.\u201d\u201cI heard of this incident too. I even asked the higher-ups if they\u2019d like this matter handled, since it attracted quite a bit of attention and caused too much panic. The higher-ups, however, plainly replied that we needn\u2019t pay this matter any heed\u2026 and that the displeasure would quell after some time,\u201d elder Xiao added.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes narrowed. Deep in his heart, he had a faint idea of what was going on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0KurisuThe three of them chatted for a while longer, continuing to down cup after cup of wine. Only after they had drunk themselves tipsy did they leave for their own homes.After returning home, Lu Sheng rested for the night. With nothing better to do, he stayed home, awaiting the posting arrangements by Crimson Whale Sect. Actually, he could guess that the so-called time for the elders to convene and discuss was mainly for the purpose of investigating his background to ascertain whether or not he was a spy sent by a rival sect.Only after such investigations were finished would he officially be a member of Crimson Whale Sect.Therefore, he was not anxious.Time passed day after day. In the blink of an eye, three days passed.This time round, it was Elder Wang, Elder Ouyang, and a Deputy Sect Master who led a team to visit him at his place.Deputy Sect Master Chen Ying [1] was Elder Wang\u2019s senior, and also the second-ranked expert in Crimson Whale Sect. He was known in the pugilistic world as Eagle Claw King.This man had fatherly eyes and kindly brows, with fully white mustache and hair. However, his physique was in tip-top condition; he was as sturdy and muscular as a young man in his prime. The blue and black knuckles on his large hands were protruding, making it seem as if he were wearing a pair of metal gloves. It was rather unsettling.When he entered the doors, he smiled warmly and kindly at Lu Sheng.\u201cPardon our intrusion! Junior Brother Lu, old man Chen and the rest are here to inform you of your posting arrangements.\u201dLu Sheng instructed Little Qiao to make some tea while he himself sat with the guests.\u201cI wonder what posting arrangement Deputy Sect Master brings me today?\u201d He seemed not to care in the least that the other party had shown him this much face by coming to his doorstep. After all, Elder Wang was an Internal Affairs Emissary; although his martial arts skills could not compare to External Affairs Emissaries, he was still an Intent Proficiency expert. It wasn\u2019t an easy feat to defeat him in barely a few moves.It was every sect\u2019s dream come true to chance upon an expert of such a level. Moreover, this expert was of a shockingly tender age.\u201cGiven Brother Lu\u2019s ability, we have unanimously agreed to appoint you as an External Affairs Emissary. If it\u2019s possible, we invite Brother Lu to head to the Headquarters together with us to meet with all the Elders, the Internal and External Affairs Emissaries, and the Sect Master. Then, you can officially assume your position,\u201d Chen Ying said extremely politely.Before he came here, he had also investigated into Lu Sheng\u2019s background. The findings of the investigation instead caused him to abandon all thoughts of taking him in as a disciple.It was very clearly indicated in Lu Sheng\u2019s file that his Lu Family had met with an incident of a wailing ghost in the night. It had been nipped in the bud by him and a travelling Taoist.Although they weren\u2019t able to gather much other than that, he had been able to survive a Black Calamity, and such a perilous one at that. His skills were also highly impressive\u2026 this man was truly extraordinary.\u201cHead to the Headquarters? Can I do that now?\u201d Lu Sheng couldn\u2019t be bothered with the pleasantries. The main motivation for him joining Crimson Whale Sect was to learn better martial arts skills. To do so, he needed to enter the Martial Proclamation Library, and to enter the Martial Proclamation Library, he needed to perform some meritorious deeds as contributions to the sect.And the main requisite to achieve that was to first take on an official role before contributing through his actions.\u201cOf course.\u201dNaturally, Chen Ying agreed. The group of people swiftly stood up and left Lu Sheng\u2019s abode to head straight for the Crimson Whale Sect Headquarters outside the city.Lu Sheng and Chen Ying shared a horse carriage to themselves.Chen Ying tilted his face to look outside the carriage the entire journey, speaking not a single word. Lu Sheng was also not a talkative person; he began to cultivate his inner Qi in silence.He could tell that Chen Ying, like him, cultivated both the inner and outer forces. Moreover, his eyes shone brilliantly; clearly, he had robust inner Qi. However, he could not tell how he would fare in actual combat. Lu Sheng decided that he would find an opportunity to duel and try him out sometime.\u201cLittle Brother, what are you views regarding the present Song Dynasty?\u201d After a long moment, Chen Ying abruptly asked.\u201cSong Dynasty? My views?\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head as he laughed lightly. \u201cNothing much. I don\u2019t know much at all about the present-day government. Frankly speaking, when I was in Nine Links City previously and encountered a Black Calamity, it helped me see clearly how useless the so-called yamen authorities are.\u201dChen Ying glanced over at Lu Sheng, shaking his head lightly. \u201cJunior Brother, that\u2019s actually a misjudgment on your part.\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s face remained the same, \u201cHow so?\u201dChen Ying coughed a couple times. When he calmed down, he said slowly, \u201cHas Junior Brother ever heard of something called Aberrations?\u201d\u201cAberrations?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s expression changed almost imperceptibly. \u201cI\u2019ve only met with very powerful and strange ghosts, are those what Deputy Sect Master means by Aberrations?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 to be very frank with you, we Crimson Whale Sect have had our own fair share of dealing with the run-of-the-mill supernatural matters. However, those can only be referred to as ghosts, or Black Calamity,\u201d Chen Ying\u2019s eyes gradually turned somber, as if he were beginning to immerse himself in his past memories.\u201cI remember one year when I traveled with Sect Master to the Central Plains to take part in the Martial Alliance Rally. On our way back, we met with a Daoist. The Daoist spoke for a long while with Sect Master and shared with us about this.\u201dHe paused for a bit before continuing.\u201cThat Daoist said that ghosts and Demonic Ghosts, at the end of the day, are merely ghosts. Even an ordinary mortal who has attained an extremely high realm in his cultivation would be able to deal with such filthy things.However, above ghosts is something called Aberrations. This is a league that ordinary mortals have no hope or possibility to reach. He cautioned Sect Master that stuff like ghosts and small demons are weak and mentally scattered. They are dim-witted and senseless creatures. However, the advanced form of ghosts are Aberrations; the advanced form of demons are Devils. Aberrations and Devils\u2013no matter how mortals cultivate, there is absolutely no way that we would be able to stand up against them. If you meet one, the only way to live through the encounter is to RUN at first sight!\u201d\u201cAberrations\u2026 and Devils\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng turned grim. He had thought that these were perhaps exactly the \u2018demons\u2019 and \u2018devils\u2019 Duanmu Wan had mentioned previously. These were merely generic category labels in the first place, but he remembered that Duanmu Wan had only mentioned \u2018demons\u2019 and \u2018devils\u2019\u2013but not Aberrations. It wasn\u2019t clear if she had missed that out, or if there was some other reason.\u201cYeah\u2026 we Crimson Whale Sect look formidable, don\u2019t we? Yet still, all we\u2019re able to deal with are ghosts, small demons, and the like. When it comes to Aberrations or Devils, we\u2019ve only met one up till this day,\u201d Chen Ying\u2019s face twitched, as if even now, he was still shaking in fear at the memory.Lu Sheng asked somberly, \u201cWhat happened?\u201dHe seemed to have the premonition that the matter had definitely ended badly.A pained look flashed on Chen Ying\u2019s face. Looking at Lu Sheng, he replied dazedly, \u201cCrimson Whale Sect originally had four Deputy Sect Masters.\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s heart lurched. He knew that, currently, there were only two Deputy Sect Masters in the Crimson Whale Sect.\u201cOur old Sect Master, he\u2026 he too was grievously wounded. He fell from the pinnacle of his power, and is now riddled with ailments\u2026 the most pathetic thing is that, because of this, his few sons are now still fighting with each other, wrestling for power and control over Crimson Whale Sect. But how could they know? So what if they gain control over the entire Sect? We don\u2019t even have a clue what kind of entity the Aberration that caused all this ruin is\u2026 not even after losing so many men,\u201d Chen Ying helplessly added.Lu Sheng kept silent. This was not something that he, a newly joined Sect member, was in the position to comment on.The two of them sat facing each other silently. After a short while later, the coachman\u2019s voice rang out, \u201cSect Master Chen, we\u2019re at the Headquarters!\u201d [2]Chen Ying broke into a smile. Regulating his emotions, he opened the carriage door and was the first to alight.\u201cCome take a look! The Crimson Whale Sect Headquarters may not be what you imagined. It\u2019s impressive alright, but it\u2019s also a bit strange.\u201dLu Sheng followed after him, alighting. To his surprise, the sight of Cypress Pine Lake greeted him.In the middle of the lake lay an enormous black-and-red ship, resting silently on the surface of the water like a massive whale.Rays of sun fell from the azure sky onto the crystal waters, brilliantly illuminating the gigantic ship, especially the white flag erected on the highest mast of the ship.Two large words in blood red were written on it: Crimson Whale!The entire ship was an oval, with a whooping eight-stories rising up from the deck. All around the body of the ship, black metal chains, each as thick as a person\u2019s thigh, were packed closely together to anchor it in place. However, these chains seemed to be merely the width of a strand of hair when compared to the relative enormity of the ship.\u201cThis is the \u2018Crimson Whale\u2019. Impressive, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Chen Ying introduced by the side.\u201cImpressive though it may be, it can\u2019t really be considered a ship anymore. This giant can\u2019t be sailed at all,\u201d Elder Wang ran over and muttered.\u201cThis huge lake is over ten li wide, and this ship itself already takes up a tenth of the area. Just maneuvering it will run the danger of colliding into the reefs in shallow waters. What\u2019s the point of sailing it?\u201dIt was also Lu Sheng\u2019s first time seeing such an enormous ship, which was perhaps even larger than an aircraft carrier. In his free time, he had calculated that the \u2018li\u2019 measurement people in this period often used was roughly the distance of six hundred meters or so. As for what Elder Wang said, the width of this ship itself was already over six hundred meters\u2013it was truly gigantic.\u201cActually, this was not built to be used as a ship in the first place. Rather, it\u2019s constructed as a water fortress,\u201d Chen Ying laughed.\u201cLet\u2019s go, the people inside have already come out to receive us.\u201dSect members lined the path that joined the huge ship and the dock, keeping close watch. They were divided into two rows; a swordsman stood guard at short intervals.Presently, there were already over ten men and women who had gathered near the sloping stairs to the boat. They were all looking in this direction.Chen Ying laughed loudly and led the group towards the other party.\u201cGreetings, Sect Master Chen,\u201d the group of them duly greeted. \u201cSect Master has been waiting for a long while.\u201dChen Ying didn\u2019t delay any further. Leading Lu Sheng and the rest in a single file, they quickly ascended the sloping stairs, crossed the path guarded by the sect members and arrived aboard the deck. Then, they walked into the main hall of the ship.The main hall looked somewhat similar to a shrine. At the highest point sat a sickly-looking old man with grizzled white hair.This old man was dressed in black-and-red athletic robes from top to toe and wore a dark-golden glove on his right hand. Although he seemed frail, he still carried a highly imposing and formidable air about him. His eyes were like a tiger\u2019s, radiant and sharp. One look into them revealed the vigor and strength of his inner Qi.As soon as Lu Sheng entered, he could feel at least five lines of sight immediately converging onto him.Actually, there were quite a few others who were also in the main hall looking at him. However, their mental energy was incomparably beneath these five people.These five lines of sight were exceptionally penetrating, and made one feel that their gazes caused the skin on one\u2019s body to have a tingling and numbing sensation akin to the pricking of needles. Clearly, these were all famed experts who had attained extraordinary achievements in both inner and outer force cultivation.Similarly, Lu Sheng no longer concealed the brilliance in his own eyes as he returned each and every one of those gazes.Inwardly, he was rather excited to be able to see so many experts of the same rank as him all at once. Logically speaking, he was at Spirit Focus, and so were the other five. If they were to battle, it still depended on their movement techniques, strength, experience as well as tactics before it would be clear who would come out on top.Almost as if sensing the eagerness and excitement to battle in Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze, three of the five lines of sight instantly disappeared in a swish. Three people quickly lowered their heads as they avoided his gaze. A hardcore battle addict was the most troublesome in any sect.Previously, one of the Deputy Sect Masters had just such a personality. He would run around to battle and exchange blows with experts all day long, causing much unspoken misery for members of the Sect. The last thing they expected was the appearance of another fella with the signs of being a hardcore battle addict.Of the five experts, two of them were Sect Master Hong Mingzi and Deputy Sect Master Gongsun Zhanglan. The other three were all External Affairs Emissaries; they were also the ones who had swiftly avoided Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze.After Lu Sheng sent out his gaze, three of them disappeared in a heartbeat. That caused him to be rather annoyed. However, it didn\u2019t matter\u2013there were still the other two.He gazed straight at the one seated highest\u2013Sect Master Hong Mingzi.\u201cIndeed\u2013a hero\u2019s posture; a dragon among men!\u201d Hong Mingzi\u2019s voice sounded somewhat frail as he exclaimed smilingly, but it still carried great vigor and energy in it.\u201cThe reason why Crimson Whale Sect has been able to lord over the North with unwavering clout is only because of fine young men like Junior Brother Lu here, who have constantly added new blood to our ranks.\u201d\u201cEveryone here has now seen him. So, what are your views?\u201d Deputy Sect Master Chen Ying also went up ahead to take his seat. Someone also approached Lu Sheng to direct him to a seat by the side.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0KurisuIt was deathly still in the main hall. Other than the five experts, there were also eight others by the sides. These were the various Elders and Internal Affairs Emissaries of the Crimson Whale Sect. Presently, none of them spoke as the battle of gazes went on.The scintillating gaze that shone off from Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes earlier had already clearly demonstrated that he was likewise a cultivator of both the inner and outer forces. It wasn\u2019t clear whether he was of Spirit Focus; however, even if he were just an Intent Proficiency expert, no one was willing to offend him, nor did they find it necessary to do so as they had no bone to pick with him.\u201cSince there aren\u2019t any objections, then it\u2019s decided. Brother Lu Sheng will be appointed as the Sixth External Affairs Emissary of the Crimson Whale Sect and take over the men and territory which were under Wu San. Everyone agrees, yes?\u201d Sect Master Hong Mingzi said smilingly.\u201cThat\u2019s not very appropriate, is it?\u201d Deputy Sect Master Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s brows furrowed as he muttered.\u201cWhat\u2019s not appropriate about that?\u201d Chen Ying looked at him. He knew that the other party had intended to let his own niece, Gongsun Jing, take over Wu San\u2019s men and territory. It was thus within expectations that he would voice his dissent now.Gongsun Zhanglan was a gloomy-looking middle-aged man. He wore black overall robes with both his hands tucked into his sleeves.He glanced at Chen Ying. Plastering a phony smile onto his face that did not reach his eyes, he said, \u201cAlthough Brother Lu Sheng\u2019s strength is exceptional, that only represents his personal strength. But if we\u2019re talking about management skills, you need more than just spunk for that.Although Wu San has passed away, there were plenty of men and assets under his command. How will the rest of the elders feel about just handing all these over on a silver platter to some newbie who has just joined the Sect? This is too generous a gift for someone who has yet to offer the slightest contribution. That\u2019s not the standard practice.\u201d\u201cWe all know how Wu San died. Now, there are those who want to acquire his men and assets, yet no one dares to take up that most dangerous matter. There\u2019s no free lunch in this world; you can\u2019t just want the benefits but not accept the risk. Sect Master Gongsun, your niece Gongsun Jing may be exceptionally brilliant and among the cream of the crop in terms of intellect. However, if she wants the position left behind by Wu San, why don\u2019t we have her take up that case as well?\u201d Chen Ying chuckled coldly as he asked.\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything about Little Jing. I was just speaking up for the Elders in the Sect as a Deputy Sect Master in charge of law enforcement. Don\u2019t tell me that many Elders who have toiled selflessly for the sect cannot even compare to a newly-joined sect member?\u201d Gongsun Zhanglan spoke calmly.Chen Ying laughed coldly, \u201cWell then, what do you mean? Even if you didn\u2019t have that in mind, to suddenly jump out at this juncture would give others that impression.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care whether others will misunderstand. As Deputy Sect Master in charge of managing law and order in the sect, it is my prerogative to point it out if I see anything that violates the rules,\u201d Gongsun Zhanglan was composed as he replied.The two of them sparred back and forth, neither convinced by the other\u2019s arguments. However, Lu Sheng was growing impatient as he looked on from the side.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to quarrel about? Whoever\u2019s not convinced can just duel with me,\u201d smacking his lips, he rose and spoke.His gaze ran across a few of the strongest people present.\u201cWe\u2019re pugilists in the pugilistic world. Whoever\u2019s fist is stronger shall have the right to speak!\u201d Lu Sheng began to warm up his fists.Gongsun Zhanglan was stunned. He looked at Lu Sheng, whose eyes bore into his, sending a chill down his spine. He composed himself.\u201cWe\u2019re all brothers of the same sect, how can we go about killing each other flippantly? If word of this got out\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is but an internal exchange. Come, don\u2019t stand on ceremony. I\u2019m just standing right here; whoever\u2019s not convinced, let\u2019s exchange some moves,\u201d Lu Sheng could feel his blood boiling and growing wild inside him.He had rather taken a fancy to fighting recently. The time when he had fought the ghost on the pleasure boat to the death had filled him with an intense sensation of his own existence.That feeling had caused his Qi and blood to surge and his spirits to lift. Added to the thrill of a near-death experience, it caused him to be somewhat entranced.\u201cBrother Lu, you might have misunderstood. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m against you taking over Wu San\u2019s responsibilities\u2026\u201d Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s face twitched.\u201cNo problem. Come on, just one match,\u201d Lu Sheng stared fixedly at him, his eyes sparkling. He believed that this guy would surely put up a good fight.\u201cBrother Lu, you really are\u2026\u201d\u201cCome on, come on, just one match.\u201dGongsun Zhanglan felt the arteries in his forehead constricting. He cleared his throat. Inside him, his blood was boiling in anger. However, under the watchful eyes of so many present, he could only suppress his fury and reply with subtle threats.\u201cInternal fighting violates the Sect rules. Moreover, there is a huge chasm between your skills and mine. I cultivate the Prime Mystic Palm, unrivaled in its force. One strike will either kill you, or at the very least maim you. If I hurt you in any way by a slip of the hand, things will turn ugly\u2026\u201d\u201cHurt me? Either kill or maim me???\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes seemed to be slowly turning blood-red. The corners of his mouth twisted up into a strange smile. \u201cIsn\u2019t that just splendid then? If we hold back like a pussy whenever we make a move, that\u2019s just playing house!\u201dHis gaze fixed unflinchingly on Gongsun Zhanglan.\u201cCome on, just one match. If I die, I deserve it!\u201dThick murderous intent slowly emanated from his body.Gongsun Zhanglan looked back at him, falling into silence.He felt that he had underestimated the extent of this new sect member\u2019s ostentation. The other party seemed to totally disregard whomever he might offend; instead, he was completely unbridled and did as he pleased.\u201cLooks like Junior Brother Lu really wants a match with me\u2026\u201d finally, faint killing intent surfaced in Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s eyes. He was now considering striking out to kill this newbie on the spot.However, he knew that with old Sect Master as well as Chen Ying present, it would be difficult for him to succeed even if he wanted to make a move.\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d as expected, the old Sect Master cut in. Cheerfully, he added, \u201cThis matter is settled; what Zhanglan said makes sense. Without any contributions to the Sect, it is truly problematic to have him manage such vast resources and power. Instead, he can first take over a portion of it. If he can solve the case, then everything will be handed over to him completely.Junior Brother Lu, what do you think about this arrangement?\u201dInstantly, the gazes of all those present converged on Lu Sheng in anticipation of his reply.\u201cIsn\u2019t there some sort of trouble in Wu San\u2019s territory? Can you tell me what sort of trouble that is?\u201d Seeing that the fight was not happening, Lu Sheng\u2019s Qi and blood began to gradually calm down. Although he was rather disappointed, he was not anxious. With so many experts here, he could easily find an opponent any time he wished to battle.\u201cWu San was the previous External Affairs Emissary. In the territory under his control, there is an iron mine that\u2019s crucial to the Sect. Some trouble occurred in the mine, so he went down to investigate, but mysteriously went missing. When he was discovered, he was found already dead in a patch of forest outside the mine,\u201d Chen Ying replied.Lu Sheng thought carefully about the matter before asking, \u201cHow\u2019s Wu San\u2019s cultivation and skills?\u201d\u201cAn Intent Proficiency expert who\u2019s a hair\u2019s breadth away from the realm of Spirit Focus. His Flying Willow Blade is elusive and unpredictable,\u201d Chen Ying answered somberly. \u201cIf he were to fight it out, he would rank among the top ten within the Sect.\u201d\u201cTop ten?\u201d Lu Sheng narrowed his eyes. Looking across at all the experts present, he could see from the Qi and spirit within their eyes which of them were on par with him.From what he had sensed earlier, six of those present were Intent Proficiency inner-outer-force double-cultivators. To rank among the top ten meant that Wu San was qualified to be one of the four strongest Intent Proficiency experts among the crowd present.\u201cSo, what about it? Any confidence to take it up?\u201d Gongsun Zhanglan began to smile faintly.Lu Sheng was growing annoyed. This person was constantly at odds with him, to the extent that it didn\u2019t even seem to make any sense. From beginning till now, this person had incessantly picked faults with Lu Sheng and stood in his way, trying all ways and means to prevent him from taking over Wu San\u2019s troops, assets and influence. Perhaps he had some ulterior motives?Lu Sheng had always been a bold yet careful person.For example, when he was on Scarlet Decks previously, he appeared to be carefree and feasting on wine and meat with his bosom buddies on the surface. In actuality, however, he had always been on his guard. Even when he was eating, he waited and watched to see if the other two were fine after taking the food to ensure that it wasn\u2019t poisoned before he himself tucked in. [1]If he had not been on his guard, then he wouldn\u2019t have brought his saber along. How many people would bring along a saber even when they were merry-making?If he hadn\u2019t encountered the creepy pleasure boat before, then Lu Sheng would also not have been that overly careful. In the end, the situation had indeed panned out the way he had expected.This time round, he would also not blindly take up a troublesome matter that had resulted in an Intent Proficiency expert\u2019s death. Instead, he enquired in detail exactly how powerful Third Wu had been.\u201cWhether I have any confidence or not\u2013what\u2019s that got to do with you?\u201d Since the other party sought to pick a bone with him, then Lu Sheng would also not show him any face.Gongsun Zhanglan was dumbstruck and his face instantly turned sour. However, he soon regained his composure and merely smiled coldly at Lu Sheng, not speaking another word.Those within the main hall had already begun to whisper among themselves. The Elders also drew closer to speak; although their voices were low, one could still faintly discern what they were talking about.Ouyang Ningzhi and another middle-aged woman conversed in low tones for a short while. Their brows were furrowed as their eyes looked in the direction of elder Wang.Elder Wang was an Internal Affairs Emissary who looked very highly upon Lu Sheng. Seeing that Sect Master Gongsun Zhanglan had made things difficult for him, Elder Wang\u2019s face was swollen red. He had wanted to speak out on a few occasions, but was held back firmly by his long-time friends around him.\u201cElder Wang\u2019s heirloom martial art\u2013the Heart-Shattering palm\u2013has been cultivated by an outsider to even more terrifying levels despite using a wrong technique. Clearly, this goes to show that Lu Sheng\u2019s aptitude is incredible and extremely rare. Elder Wang must have sent a letter by pigeon as soon as he could have to inform his elder brother to head here. That Gongsun Zhanglan thinks that he has backing and is unconcerned about causing offense. However, if Wang Yuanshan gets here, things will turn nasty,\u201d Ouyang Ningzhi whispered.\u201cWang Yuanshan?\u201d The middle-aged female Daoist by the side was shocked as she said, \u201cDo you mean one they call the \u2018Nine-Strokes Sword and Palm\u2013Wang Yuanshan\u2019?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s him. He\u2019s an extraordinary one indeed\u2026 if he actually came here,\u201d Ouyang Ningzhi found it hard to continue. She suspected that the reason why the other External Affairs Emissaries were unwilling to offend Lu Sheng was also precisely for this reason. Given elder Wang\u2019s personality as Big-Mouthed Wang, he had probably already spread word of Lu Sheng across the entire upper echelons of the sect.Presently, in the main hall, Lu Sheng had also asked some general questions regarding Wu San\u2019s matters and gotten a rough picture of the ins and outs of the situation.The story was very simple.A Manor that stood next to the Sect\u2019s most important iron mine had met with trouble.That wasn\u2019t a big deal. However, of all places, it was positioned on the road towards the iron ore mine. Thus, one had to pass by that Manor to arrive at the mine.After a slew of disappearances of miners who vanished while on their way to the mine, it attracted the attention of the higher ranks within the Sect. Some people were dispatched to investigate into the matter; yet, these people who had gone forth to investigate also ended up missing themselves.Only then did the Sect swiftly classify the matter as a Black Calamity to be handled by the External Affairs Emissaries.As for these External Affairs Emissaries, they were all willing to head down to handle this Black Calamity purely because of the promise of astronomical remunerations and benefits.Even the Sect Master himself could not compare in terms of the welfare and benefits enjoyed by these External Affairs Emissaries. The position itself was also largely based on rotation and was not a long-term responsibility of a sole person. It changed every year.Most of them at the high levels took turns to assume the role of an External Affairs Emissary for a term. That was the case for Wu San as well\u2013he had only just been appointed there on rotation when he learned of the Black Calamity. Taking every possible precaution, he had led an entire team of five Strength Proficiency experts to check the matter out.In the end, Wu San had vanished. As for the people he had brought along, they all disappeared too. Subsequently, their corpses had been discovered in that small patch of forest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The case reminded him of the massacre of Brother Xu Daoran\u2019s family in Nine Links City. Even till today, the culprit had not been identified.Under the stares of all present, he shut his eyes and fell deep in thought. Then, slowly, he opened them again.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll take on this case. But I can\u2019t guarantee that I\u2019ll crack it. If I can\u2019t, then I will return this position within one year.\u201dA trace of helplessness surfaced in Chen Ying\u2019s eyes. Even the two Deputy Sect Masters had no confidence to take over Wu San\u2019s case, yet this lad was actually daring to do so?\u201cThat\u2019s settled then,\u201d Sect Master Hong Mingzi laughed heartily. \u201cThe newborn calf is unafraid of the tiger. Brother Lu, although you\u2019ve accepted the position, if this thing goes south, then let go of it early. Losing another Wu San is the last thing we want to see.\u201dLu Sheng nodded.After some discussion, the scope of power and estate that would fall under Lu Sheng\u2019s command was settled as well.This included roughly three hundred-odd experts that formed a saber squad, numerous stores in Mountain-Edge City, over ten farming villas outside the city, several oil refineries and, most important of all, blacksmith and craftsmanship stores. There were more than ten of each of them, set apart to forge weapons and tools for sect disciples.Hence, while Wu San\u2019s properties could not be considered many, they were extremely vital to the sect. That was also the key reason why even Deputy Sect Master Gongsun Zhanglan was so eager to interfere in the division.Of course, Lu Sheng was still unable to command these assets for the time being. He could only deploy a portion of them to work on cracking the iron mine case. Only after solving the iron mine case could he be considered a legitimate External Affairs Emissary.They dispersed after the discussion. Internal Affairs Emissary Elder Wang took the initiative to approach Lu Sheng and took him up aboard his own carriage towards Mountain-Edge City.On the carriage, Elder Wang formally introduced to Lu Sheng his family\u2019s connection to the Heart-Shattering Palm.\u201cThe iron mine case is a real pain in the neck. Brother Lu, you\u2019ve definitely got to look before you leap; don\u2019t be impulsive. Anyway, about Heart-Shattering Palm\u2026 this old man would like to ask: did you learn your version of Heart-Shattering Palm from a man called Zhang Xun in Nine Links City?\u201dLu Sheng nodded, \u201cIndeed, it was imparted to me by Senior Constable Zhang Xun.\u201d\u201cNo wonder. Zhang Xun used to be one of my disciples. But because he didn\u2019t show much promise or talent, I\u2019ve never really noticed him. But now he\u2019s practiced it to Strength Proficiency\u2026 unbelievable\u2026\u201d Elder Wang exclaimed. \u201cThis old man hasn\u2019t taken in more than a few disciples in my whole life. But it\u2019s a pity that not a single one among those whom I\u2019ve pinned high hopes on ever made a name for themselves. On the contrary, it was someone whom I didn\u2019t expect much of who achieved something in the end.\u201d\u201cElder Brother Wang has done precisely what the proverb says\u2013\u2018a randomly planted willow has become shade\u2019,\u201d Lu Sheng laughed.\u201cI guess,\u201d Elder Wang shook his head. \u201cBrother Lu, I came looking for you to ask\u2013are you interested in learning the Wang Family\u2019s genuine orthodox Heart-Shattering Palm?\u201d\u201cWhat does Elder Wang mean?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s brow raised. He knew that the orthodox Heart-Shattering Palm was elder Wang\u2019s heirloom martial arts. If he said yes, it\u2019d probably come with a long list of conditions. There was no free lunch in the world.\u201cMy elder brother has a daughter; she\u2019s young, pretty and well-figured\u2026\u201d once elder Wang spoke, Lu Sheng\u2019s face turned into a face of awkwardness.\u201cHold it, Elder Wang, hold it,\u201d Lu Sheng waved his hand continuously. \u201cI\u2019m still young and don\u2019t want to think about marriage. Wait till the day I\u2019ve achieved some accomplishments in the martial arts world in the future. When that day comes, it\u2019s not too late for me to consider this issue.\u201dA look of disappointment instantly appeared on Elder Wang\u2019s face. Staring at Lu Sheng, he knew that he meant it and so laid the notion to rest. After all, Wu San\u2019s case wasn\u2019t cracked yet. This case was truly a hornet\u2019s nest even among Black Calamities. Given the slightest carelessness, this young lad, Brother Lu, may not even live through it. He sighed with pity inwardly. If only Brother Lu had not taken up the case, then things could still change with his older brother\u2019s intervention. But now that he\u2019s taken it up\u2026The two of them started chatting about martial arts after that. Elder Wang gained quite a bit of inspiration from Lu Sheng and his admiration for him grew even deeper.Lu Sheng, too, gained a much deeper understanding of the present situation in the pugilistic world. For example, he gained general knowledge about the different existing sects and factions, how to handle different sorts of situations, what were hot button issues to avoid\u2026 etc.Finally, Lu Sheng arrived back at his apartment in Mountain-Edge City. After some meditation, Lu Sheng retired for the night.Early in the morning, a man named Duan Meng\u2019an, one of Wu San\u2019s direct subordinates, showed up at his door with some men.Lu Sheng opened the door to see two neat rows of men before him\u2013each of them muscular men who were sturdily built and tanned.The day had yet to dawn when the two rows of men bowed respectfully towards Lu Sheng in unison.\u201cWe pay our respects, Boss!\u201d [1]Their shout reverberated into the house, causing even the beams to vibrate.Standing in the doorway and looking at the gang of gray-robed men who had been waiting energetically for him and even addressed him \u201cboss\u201d, Lu Sheng felt as if he had turned into a mafia boss in a second.\u201cIn the future, call me\u2026 erm\u2026 what did you use to call Wu San?\u201dOne of the men standing in front who sported a crew cut replied, \u201cIn reply to your question, Boss, we called him Boss Wu!\u201d [2]Lu Sheng\u2019s face twitched. He imagined a group of people calling him \u201cBoss Lu\u201d the moment they saw him\u2026 it was excruciating\u2026\u201cIn the future, just call me either Young Master or Lord.\u201dDuan Meng\u2019an, their leader, scratched his head, \u201cIn that case we better call you Young Master. \u2018Lord\u2019 is reserved for those old court officials.\u201d\u201cWorks for me,\u201d Lu Sheng nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s go down. Tell me about the forces I can deploy now along the way.\u201dThe group descended the stairs and swiftly arrived on the street. Some of them rode on horses, some of them walked. Lu Sheng and Duan Meng\u2019an, however, boarded a horse carriage.\u201cWithin the forces Young Master has authority to deploy now, there\u2019re four Strength Proficiency expert\u2013including myself, thirty-two ordinary experts, and the rest are just average sect disciples.Our forces had already suffered heavy casualties. And after Boss Wu was gone, much of his assets were cut out for other Internal Affairs Emissaries. Only the iron mines and some related assets remain. Now, we\u2019re a little hard-pressed\u2026 we beg for your understanding, Young Master.\u201d\u201cBy how do I deploy them? A code? A command token? Or some other way?\u201d Lu Sheng asked.\u201cThis is your command token, which serves as your seal as well. Our branch is the 6th Black Soil Division. All of our brothers in the Black Soil Division must take orders from you as long as they see your command token, Young Master,\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an explained as he took out a bronze command token.Lu Sheng received it and scrutinized it. It was a palm-sized plate in the shape of a fish, of intricate craftsmanship and carved with pine trees and rice ear motifs.As Duan Meng\u2019an continued his briefing, the horse carriage exited Mountain-Edge City. Under the escort of two rows of men who bore the flag of Crimson Whale Sect, it headed in the direction of the iron mine mountain.The sky gradually turned bright, though it looked overcast and gloomy as thick, heavy clouds loomed overhead.After about an hour spent traveling outside the city, the horse carriage arrived on a stretch of blackish yellow soil. Beside the path, stone pits would appear every now and then.One after another, these stone pits looked like pits caused by grenade explosions. They lay here and there. Large ones were over ten meters wide; even the small ones were at least several meters wide.Lu Sheng narrowed his eyes at the scenery outside the carriage window, his spirits rather low.\u201cWhy\u2019re there so many pits here?\u201d He sniffed at the air. A hint of decay was in the wind, like the stench emanated by rotting meat.Duan Meng\u2019an glanced at the pits outside and replied, \u201cYoung Master, these used to be quarries from which stones were extracted for building houses in Mountain-Edge City. After that, for some unknown reason, this place was abandoned, leaving behind all these different-sized pits.\u201dLu Sheng nodded. \u201cHow far are we away from the iron mine mountain?\u201d\u201cApproximately half of the distance.\u201d\u201cNo hurry then. Cue me when we arrive,\u201d Lu Sheng replied casually.\u201cYes,\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an leaned towards the window earnestly, taking note of the path outside.The carriage passed through the stone pit-filled region and quickly entered a hilly area covered in small white flowers. In contrast to the stone pits, the grassy hills here looked much more refreshing, teeming with life.The team continued forward past the hills. It was near noon when they finally arrived at the region in which Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s iron mountain was located.Crimson Whale Sect had built a batch of small wooden huts here to house the supervisors, miners and sect disciples dispatched here. Previously, these huts had formed a mini-village, handily named Iron Mine Village.This village was also the team\u2019s destination.The wheels turned round and round. Lu Sheng sat by the window and rested for a moment. Then suddenly, he was gently awoken by Duan Meng\u2019an.\u201cYoung Master, we\u2019re pulling into Iron Mine Village now.\u201dLu Sheng opened his eyes and craned his neck out of the window.The carriage was passing by a manor enclosed by a high wall. Blotches on the manor\u2019s grayish white perimeter wall made it look old and ill-repaired. No one was in its vicinity, lending the place a cold stillness.The carriage had to go around the manor to continue the journey in another direction.As the carriage went around the manor, Lu Sheng gazed at the manor. A sea of silence and desolation was within those walls, as if not a single living soul lived in it.\u201cThis is the Song Manor,\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an\u2019s face looked drained of color as he uttered the manor\u2019s name. The stark contrast formed between the big-sized, muscular stature of this man and the expression of fear on his face left a deep impression on Lu Sheng\u2019s mind.\u201cOh, Song Manor\u2026 the one that met with mishap?\u201d He asked.\u201cYes, Young Master. It was precisely to investigate the incident in the manor that Boss Wu entered inside. But after that, he vanished into thin air. Only later, in the forest out there\u2026\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an bowed his head, not daring to look at the manor outside the window. \u201cThe brothers here with us this time round are all newbies who haven\u2019t joined us for long. So, they\u2019re not clear about this incident. Within this team, I\u2019m the only one who knows that this was the manor that met with mishap. So, please don\u2019t divulge it, Young Master.\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s eyes narrowed as he scrutinized the manor passing by outside the window.Very quickly, the carriage had arrived by the manor\u2019s front entrance.The red-painted giant doors that should have been shut tight were presently left ajar, leaving a gap between them.Lu Sheng peered through the gap and laid eyes on a section of the scenery in the manor through it.In the run-down courtyard were dried and rotten garden plants, fallen leaves which had covered the ground like a carpet and barren tree forks.The manor was desolate, without a single soul in sight.\u201cThis Song Manor has been deserted, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d Lu Sheng inquired softly.\u201cThere were people living in it previously\u2013the eldest son of the couple in the manor, a scholar, lived here. And his younger sister, too, lived here. After the incident\u2026 I\u2019ve no idea about now,\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an replied quietly.\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone,\u201d Lu Sheng carefully peered through the gap again. As the carriage moved, he was also getting a better view of the scene in the courtyard from different angles.A barren, rotten tree.Windows covered in dust.A white lantern that swayed in the wind.House pillars covered in scars and marks.And\u2026 a gray-robed scholar, standing on a stone bridge. His hair was disheveled, his eyes staring dead straight at the passing horse carriage.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes sprung wide open. With his powers of sight, he could clearly see that the scholar\u2019s face was devoid of any emotion, his eyes bloodshot and face as pale as paper. Standing in that spot, he seemed completely like a corpse\u2013save for the blinking of his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0KurisuPreviously, Lu Sheng did not catch sight of anyone because his line of sight had been partially blocked by the door. But now that the carriage had shifted forwards, the angle changed and another corner of the courtyard entered his view.The stone bridge and the scholar were in that corner.The scholar stood in that spot, stiff as a statue, staring at the passing horse carriage.Lu Sheng, too, examined that scholar in detail. His clothes were tattered and torn. They were filthy and worn, as if they had not been washed for many days. It was also riddled with holes. Moreover, his hair fell all over his shoulders in a mess. Presently, he was standing still on the stone bridge like a pillar, without so much as a budge.\u201cNo one has entered or exited the manor for many days. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody staying in it anymore. After all, without anyone entering or exiting the manor, what would anyone staying inside eat?\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an explained, not having seen the scholar from his angle.\u201cBut there is someone indeed, as a matter of fact. Isn\u2019t he one?\u201d Lu Sheng wagged his chin towards the manor.Duan Meng\u2019an quickly glanced in the direction.Yet, curiously, when he glanced over, the scholar had vanished into thin air in the blink of an eye.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes narrowed to a slit. It was just a single moment of distraction as he spoke to Duan Meng\u2019an, yet he had actually failed to notice the moment when the scholar had disappeared.\u201cWhere? Young Master, please don\u2019t frighten me,\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an was starting to have the shivers because of Lu Sheng. He peered through the gap between the doors carefully again but saw no sight of any figure.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes focused.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Perhaps it was my imagination.\u201dThe horse carriage slowly pulled away from the manor. All the way, Lu Sheng kept recalling the scholar\u2019s looks. Somehow, he had a peculiar intuition that something was off about the man.Soon, the team arrived at Iron Mine Village.The village was silent and deathly still, just like a cemetery. Wooden houses, some with doors left ajar and others shut, stood one after the other. The wooden doors swung and creaked in the wind.Each of the men in the team, despite their original strength and vigor, could not help but feel deeply unsettled as they walked between the houses.Dusk began to fall. Lu Sheng and Duan Meng\u2019an alighted from the carriage and entered a relatively intact wooden house.Some of these houses had leaking roofs and were ill-suited to housing people once it rained. The gang of men each found wooden huts to stay the night. They made do with the water skins and dry rations they had brought.Lu Sheng settled into a wooden house that was larger than the rest. He had men move his tent and blankets down from the carriage. After starting a fire in the house, the men then boiled a pot of water drawn from a nearby brook. With some dried meat and mushrooms thrown in and after waiting for it to stew, it turned into a pot of delicious mushroom and sliced meat soup.The gang squeezed into the cramped quarters, each with a bowl of mushroom and sliced meat soup, eaten together with the dry rations. It made for a rather enjoyable meal.Lu Sheng, however, was not in the mood to share a meal with the gang. He exited the wooden house and stared in the direction of the manor from the day.Moonlight spilled down like a white sash. Under the moonlight, the manor was a faint ball of gray shadow in the distance, a short journey away from the village of wooden houses.Lu Sheng clutched onto his cloak tightly. His brows locked together in a furrow as he gazed at the manor.Duan Meng\u2019an staggered out with a hint of drunkenness.\u201cYoung Master, why aren\u2019t you coming and joining the brothers for a drink?\u201dLu Sheng shook his head lightly, \u201cHave sentries been arranged?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Young Master. It\u2019s been arranged. Three men keep watch in three directions separately. After some food later, we\u2019ll go replace them,\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an was one of Wu San\u2019s key personnel in the past, after all. He was an old hand at dealing with such matters.\u201cTomorrow, we\u2019ll check out the mine first. Then, we will proceed to the manor,\u201d Lu Sheng retracted his gaze and said calmly.\u201cYes, sir. The mine is just nearby. If not for the fact that we haven\u2019t managed to hire any miners so far, we\u2019d be producing a lot of iron ore each day,\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an said with pity.\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, what skill do you practice in the sect?\u201d Lu Sheng asked casually.\u201cIt\u2019s the Bear-Wrestling Arm from the Martial Proclamation Library, a secret manual on the third level\u2026\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an chuckled.\u201cBear-Wrestling Arm? Sounds like it\u2019s a strength-related skill?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s interest was piqued whenever a conversation\u2019s topic turned to martial arts.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I, Old Duan, haven\u2019t got any other advantages, except for above-average strength that I was born with. That\u2019s why I chose this as my main skill.\u201dSeeing as he had nothing better to do, Lu Sheng began inquiring with Duan Meng\u2019an on other matters that had to do with martial arts.Duan Meng\u2019an was an experienced member of the sect and Lu Sheng was pleasantly surprised with the results of his inquiry. He\u2019d obtained a general impression and overall idea of the skills of the sect\u2019s few top leaders from Duan Meng\u2019an.As for the skills belonging to the rest, they fell by and large within his expectations. Hearing a description of them, Lu Sheng surmised that they largely paled in comparison to the might of his own Blood Fury Skill.That was, of course, with exception of the Sect Master and Deputy Sect Masters. According to Duan Meng\u2019an, each time these three showed their hand, they would settle the score instantly and resolve any problem within a short time. Hence, none had actually truly witnessed them go all out.\u201cYoung Master is now qualified to enter the Martial Proclamation Library and browse through the free manuals too! My Bear-Wrestling Arm isn\u2019t much to brag about within the Strength Proficiency tier; it\u2019s just very well suited to me,\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an smiled.\u201cWell, I must say you\u2019re a smart one. You understand that the best skill is the one that suits you best,\u201d Lu Sheng smiled too. \u201cBear-Wrestling Arm is one of the sect\u2019s free manuals, I know\u2026 but I\u2019ve never seen it. Is it a hard body skill?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s a hard body skill that specializes in training strength. And no medicinal potions are needed. Very simple,\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an scratched his head.\u201cOh? Do you mind performing a demonstration for me?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes lit up. He had long since desired to practice a hard body skill, but almost all of them required medicinal potions and so didn\u2019t work out. He hadn\u2019t expected that Duan Meng\u2019an was practicing a hard body skill that didn\u2019t require any medicinal potions at all.Duan Meng\u2019an didn\u2019t mind in the slightest. In the first place, the skill was free for all sect disciples. Moreover, the one asking him for a demonstration was his own boss whose skills far surpassed his own. There and then, he found a withered tree and performed Bear-Wrestling Arm\u2019s technique on it.Lu Sheng questioned him in detail and, before long, thoroughly mastered Bear-Wrestling Arm.This skill had only one level and was very easy to cultivate. One merely needed to calibrate one\u2019s own breathing and posture according to the mantra formula, then imagine oneself as a bear and slam at a tree with a particular rhythm and sequence.Its cultivation method was that simple. Lu Sheng, too, stepped forward and tried it himself. No inner Qi was required. Neither was any excessive force. Only plain old slamming until the point where one\u2019s skin hurt.After practicing for a while according to the mantra, his skin itched and ached perceptibly.\u201cYoung Master\u2019s amazing indeed. It took me many days to grasp the technique. But Young Master got it in one go,\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an complimented with a smile.\u201cThis skill is simple indeed. And the results aren\u2019t too shabby. The only challenge is persistence. To achieve full-mastery, it takes at least twenty years of hard work,\u201d Lu Sheng felt that this hard body skill was likely a segment of a larger skill; it didn\u2019t feel complete, since it focused exclusively on tempering strength and the hardness of one\u2019s skin.\u201cHowever, if you follow the mantra carefully, this is how you should do it\u2026\u201dHaving cultivated several skills to full-mastery, Lu Sheng\u2019s depth of insight and experience was leagues above Duan Meng\u2019an\u2019s. After he had comprehended this skill, he quickly discerned its essence. Thus, he could even correct some of Duan Meng\u2019an\u2019s mistakes. Just a few pointers from Lu Sheng led Duan Meng\u2019an to enlightenment and left him truly in awe of Lu Sheng.Right there and then, he immediately experimented with corrections advised by Lu Sheng. As expected, he achieved significantly better results than usually. His admiration for Lu Sheng grew even deeper.Very quickly, the pair exchanging martial arts pointers outside attracted the rest of the men eating and resting in the wooden house. These men had all practiced the skill that even the most ordinary sect members knew\u2013Crimson Whale Saber Technique.Crimson Whale Saber Technique was the sect\u2019s basic foundational saber technique. On top of saber fundamentals, it included some improvements and moves more oriented towards combat and killing. As a result, it was pretty powerful.Once again, Lu Sheng turned around to teach them the essence behind Crimson Whale Saber Technique after having learnt it once through.After a whole night of learning, all men retired and went to sleep.Lu Sheng, however, remained standing outside the wooden house. He watched his men as sentries changed. Light flickered incessantly from the lanterns they carried.He slowly adjusted and regulated the inner Qi within him.\u2018Deep Blue.\u2019The Modifier screen immediately emerged before him. Small boxes listed all the skills he had cultivated up till this day.\u2018Black Tiger Saber Technique: Level Four.Blood Fury Skill: Level Four. Special Effect(s): Fire Poison, Incendiary.Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill: Level Three. Special Effect(s): Rapid Homeostasis. Physical Restoration. Tiger\u2019s Roar and Crane\u2019s Call.Yin Yang Attraction: Level Three.Ninety-Nine Strokes Eighty-Four Swallows Pursuing the Wind Blade: Level Three.Eight Precious Steps: Level Three.Double-Horned Blade: Level Three.Heart-Shattering Palm: Level Three.\u2019A column of martial arts exhaustively detailed all of Lu Sheng\u2019s craft. All skills had been cultivated to the maximum level.And now, two additional skills appeared beneath these martial arts:\u2018Bear-Wrestling Arm: Initiated.Crimson Whale Saber Technique: Initiated.\u2019Lu Sheng clicked on the \u2018Begin Modification\u2019 button, then focused his attention on Bear-Wrestling Arm.\u2018Upgrade Bear-Wrestling Arm to full-mastery.\u2019On the Modifier screen, the column that bore Bear-Wrestling Arm grew fuzzy, then turned clear again in an instant.In just the blink of an eye, Bear-Wrestling Arm had turned from \u2018Initiated\u2019 to \u2018Full-Mastery\u2019.Lu Sheng could plainly sense the Black Tiger Jade Crane inner Qi rapidly depleting within him. The fast rate of depletion caught him off guard.\u2018This is clearly a low-grade hard body skill, pretty much on the same tier as Pursuing the Wind Blade. Why does it cost so much?\u2019 He sensed the inner Qi getting madly absorbed by the body. Within the span of a few breaths, the volume of inner Qi within him had dropped from one hundred percent to fifty percent; then to thirty percent\u2026 twenty percent\u2026 ten percent.At the same time, his skin was turning harder and stronger. The muscles on his arms and waist thickened and bulged instantly.Lu Sheng clearly sensed that his strength had gone through a drastic change.\u2018It\u2019s just a hard body skill\u2026\u2019 he was astonished. He stood still until the transformation was complete.A joss stick\u2019s duration later, he breathed out at length.\u2018Looks like the transformation of the body induced by hard body skills is far greater than that caused by other skills. Perhaps that\u2019s why it cost way more than other skills.\u2019Lu Sheng stretched out his hand and clenched his fist. A sense of inflation gushed out from deep within him, like a rubber balloon being inflated. Even his organs began to heat up.Closing his eyes and sensing the changes in his body, Lu Sheng saw the Yin Yang Attraction inner Qi being consumed rapidly. Simultaneously, the Black Tiger Jade Crane inner Qi that had just earlier been depleted began replenishing rapidly.From ten percent, it was restored to the hundred percent of his peak in the span of a few breaths. And the exhaustion of Yin Yang Attraction inner Qi up till then was merely about half the total volume.\u2018So that\u2019s the real function of Yin Yang Attraction,\u2019 Lu Sheng was first surprised, then overjoyed. \u2018My strength rose by approximately twenty percent. My skin has also gotten tougher.\u2019He drew out his saber from the sheath on his back and slashed across the back of his hand. He didn\u2019t use much strength; it was about the amount of strength normal people used to cut meat.\u201cCHA.\u201dA red mark appeared on his skin. However, his skin did not break.\u2018Just one hard body skill alone reaped such amazing effects! And this is a new saber I recently bought,\u2019 Lu Sheng nodded in satisfaction. \u2018When this case is over, I\u2019ve gotta search hard in the Martial Proclamation Library\u2026 perhaps I can find many other free martial arts helpful to me,\u2019 his anticipation towards Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s Martial Proclamation Library deepened.Raising his head, Lu Sheng gazed in the direction of the manor again. Faintly, he could perceive that the manor was hiding a certain something.He set his mind to remain here for a good few days and investigate it thoroughly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

[1]\u201cI\u2019m leaving, Juanjuan!\u201dA girl with double braids carrying a cloth satchel waved at her good friend who was still inside the study hall.Song Yunjuan smiled at her from her seat. [2]\u201cHurry and go, or your parents will scold you again if you\u2019re late.\u201d\u201cYea!\u201dThat girl skipped away in a light jog as she left under the evening sky. She went further and further away, until she was no longer visible.Song Yunjuan waited till she could no longer see her good friend before withdrawing her gaze. She looked around at the empty study hall; everyone had left, leaving only her behind.\u201cI should get back too,\u201d carefully, Song Yunjuan kept her brush, ink and straw paper from her desk. She stuffed them into her little satchel, stood up and tidied herself, then walked out of the study hall.Under the evening sky, Huang Manor looked especially still and faint.A few of the women who had been chatting by the walls hurriedly rose and left as soon as they caught sight of Song Yunjuan exiting. Seemingly, they had no wish to even lay eyes on her.In the distance, there were a few boys aged around seven or eight. They had been fooling around, yet the moment they caught sight of Song Yunjuan, the boys were instantly scared into fleeing at top speed.\u201cRUN! The jinx is out!\u201d\u201cThis way!\u201dSong Yunjuan seemed not to mind. Lowering her head, she spruced up her little satchel and headed in the direction of her house.The Huang Manor was only a few li away from her house, which was not far. However, for a girl like her who was barely ten years old, it was an extremely long distance.Actually, everything at home had been fine up till a few years ago. Then, her father, mother, and her grandparents were all alive and well.However, ever since two years ago, Big Bro began to grow obsessed with concocting pills to attain immortality, even forfeiting the Annual Examinations. All through the day, he would go on and on at home, burying himself in cultivating immortal magic and pill concocting methods. Worse, he had wantonly wasted the family\u2019s assets to buy various rubbish and nonsensical manuals on immortality and pill concoction.From then on, their life had taken a turn for the worse.First, it was Grandpa and Grandma who had vanished after a day out hiking, never to return. Then, both Father and Mother, while they were still in mourning for the grandparents, were involved in an accident. The horse carriage they were in had crashed and plummeted down a cliff.Afterwards, there had been no one else at home to restrain Big Bro. He thus began to concoct pills and cultivate immortality with deranged fervor, as if he had been possessed.As for the other brothers and sisters, most had left their home in disappointment. Even until now, only she and Big Bro remained living in the Manor. In order to concoct pills, Big Bro had sold off everything of value within the house, such that the entire Manor was now barren. Not even thieves were willing to visit. The house servants had also all been dismissed, leaving just the two of them behind.Song Yunjuan\u2019s fair face showed some hints of dejection. She was beginning to miss her grandpa and her father.\u201cAlso, Mother\u2019s osmanthus cake was really yummy\u2026\u201d lowering her head, she gently rubbed at her eyes, which had once again turned moist. She quickened her steps towards home.Sadly, she had nothing left now. Thankfully, Mister Chen at the private college took pity on her family circumstances and didn\u2019t chase her out just because she couldn\u2019t afford to pay the silver, and allowed her to remain to take the lessons.Trudging along the entire way, Song Yunjuan used a straw string to gather up all her shoulder-length short hair. After walking swiftly on the journey, she finally arrived at the entrance of the house just as night had fallen.The main door of the Song Manor was unlocked and opened a crack. All the surroundings were in pitch-black, without a single soul in sight.Song Yunjuan had long since grown used to it. Pushing hard onto the main door, she entered. Then, she turned round to lock the door and placed a thick, heavy beam across it.\u201cThud. \u201dHaving locked the main door, she swept the ash off her hands and turned to head towards the courtyard.Fallen leaves and dry twigs lay strewn on the ground. Inside, the room was pitch-black; even the fires were not lit.Borrowing the moonlight, she headed in the direction of the side hall.Within the barren and deathly silent rectangular courtyard, only the pitter-patter sound of her footsteps rang out. Her worn-out deer-skin moccasins struck against the stony floor, causing \u2018tuk\u2019 \u2018tuk\u2019 \u2018tuk\u2019 sounds to ring out constantly.Song Yunjuan had long since gotten used to such a sight. She walked quickly to the side hall and took a look. It was dark and dim inside; moonlight shone off the barren dining table in the middle.Nothing was on top of it.\u201cAi\u2026\u201dSighing, she could only head towards Big Bro\u2019s sleeping quarters.Crossing over the stone bridge, she walked towards the largest room on the left and lightly pushed onto the door.\u201cKa-cha.\u201dThe friction of wood striking against wood screeched shrilly across the whole Manor, piercing through the silence.It was dark and gloomy inside the room. Song Yunjuan could only barely make out the arrangement within the room thanks to the moonlight.The left corner of the room was cast entirely in shadows. Under the moonlight, one could faintly see that an object of enormous size sat there.Song Yunjuan knew that that was Big Bro\u2019s pill furnace.She craned her neck to look to the right, where she could see a square table. She could faintly see some bowls on it.\u201cBig Bro, you\u2019re still concocting pills?\u201dSilence.\u201cMm, just concocted a few,\u201d a male voice drifted out from the silence.Song Yunjuan entered the room. Groping around, she made her way to the dining table, before feeling for the pair of chopsticks and preparing to tuck in.However, once she tucked in, she realized that the dish was actually cold. Fine. She could accept that fire couldn\u2019t be lit at night. But now, food can\u2019t even be heated up? What sort of cold concoction method was this that didn\u2019t even require fire?\u201cBig Bro, you didn\u2019t heat up the dishes again?\u201d\u201cYeah. I prepared them this morning and haven\u2019t had the time to heat it up,\u201d a reply sounded out from the dark.Song Yunjuan sighed.However, what she could not see was that not even a single soul was present in the darkness behind the pill furnace!No one was there. So where did that voice come from?No one knows.After eating merely two mouthfuls, she couldn\u2019t really stomach the food anymore. The meat inside seemed to have gone rancid, as if it hadn\u2019t been prepared just this morning.\u201cToday I talked to Chen Meiqin, she\u2019ll come over to our place in a few days to play, Big Bro\u2026\u201d\u201cMm, I\u2019m listening,\u201d that voice answered.\u201cCan you accompany me at home in the day?\u201d Yunjuan asked softly.\u201cI need to concoct pills,\u201d was the short reply.\u201cYou can\u2019t accompany me for even a day?\u201d Yunjuan\u2019s eyes brimmed with disappointment.\u201cI need to concoct pills,\u201d that voice repeated.Yunjuan clammed up. Lowering her head, she continued to eat in silence.She seemed not to realize at all that a tall, large shadow had approached soundlessly from a corner of the room and gradually loomed behind her.That shadow had a pale, miserable countenance. It was a male face that was devoid of any trace of emotion.He lowered his head to look at Yunjuan. Slowly, he stretched out a hand, in which was gripped a pair of scissors, dripping in blood\u2026\u201cBang, bang, bang!\u201dSuddenly, violent knocking could be heard on the main door of the courtyard.Song Yunjuan stood up in a heartbeat.\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Hurrying outside, she arrived at the main door.\u201cAnybody home? We\u2019re hikers in the area, and happened to pass by here. We\u2019re stuck here temporarily because a mountain boulder had fallen in the way, so we\u2019re hoping to take shelter here for the night,\u201d a crisp male voice, somewhat warm and friendly, rang out.Song Yunjuan hesitated for a moment. Currently, only she and her Big Bro were in the manor. If these people were up to no good\u2026\u201cLittle girl, are any of the adults home? We can pay the required silver in advance, a night is all we need,\u201d the person again called out. \u201cWe\u2019re not bad people. These are the expenses for staying the night.\u201d\u201cSWISH.\u201dA tart sound could be heard as a string of large currency was thrown in over the wall dividing them.Song Yunjuan sprinted over to take a look and picked it up.Eight huge copper coins twice the average size had been strung together on a black string. It shimmered copper-black in the moonlight.She counted them carefully. There were actually eight huge coins, which was equivalent to a tael of silver. For this person to part with eight large coins so flippantly, this man was clearly not short of money.Song Yunjuan deliberated over the matter. Remembering that there was a man, her Big Bro, in the house, she lifted the beam over the door and exerted all her strength to swing the door open.\u201cCreak. \u201dThe door opened wide to reveal three muscular men standing by the entrance. From one look, it was clear that they were young men who practiced martial arts.In the lead was a man wearing grayish-white Confucian robes, looking somewhat like a scholar; yet even the loose scholarly robes could not conceal the man\u2019s bulging muscles and robust physique.Song Yunjuan laid eyes on the three of them, her gaze gradually lowering to fall on the hilts of the sabers that they carried on their bodies. Immediately, her heart began to pound violently.\u201cLittle miss, are you alone at home? My name is Lu Sheng and we happened to pass by here. We did not expect at all to meet with a mountain landslide, and for the moment, we can\u2019t head back. Only this manor is the safest among those in the vicinity; the high walls keep out the wild beasts. That\u2019s why we hope to stay the night.\u201d This scholar attempted his best to convey warmth and friendliness, but his intense murderous aura and rippling muscular build, as well as the long saber hung horizontally across his back all clearly indicated that that this man was no kind soul.\u201cMy Big Bro is also home. However, he\u2019s concocting pills, so if there\u2019s no issue, don\u2019t disturb him,\u201d Song Yunjuan instructed seriously. \u201cAlso, it\u2019s okay if you stay, but don\u2019t light any fires. My Big Bro doesn\u2019t like it to be bright.\u201d\u201cHow can we not light fires?\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an, who was behind Lu Sheng, could not help but mutter under his breath.Song Yunjuan bit tightly on her lips, sensing that the three before her were a menace. She was rather frightened and shrunk backwards.\u201cIf\u2026 if you must light any fires, then you do so where you are staying. Don\u2019t bring it out, or my Big Bro will be mad. When he\u2019s angry, it\u2019s really scary\u2026\u201dLu Sheng narrowed his eyes and gazed towards the interior of the Manor. Indeed, it was pitch-black within. Quite a number of lanterns hung around the area, yet not a single one of them was lit.\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll just light our own room, is that alright?\u201d He smiled warmly at Song Yunjuan.Song Yunjuan clung tightly onto the string of huge coins. The house had truly run out of any remaining money; to her, this amount was really crucial. With a bit of scrimping and saving, she would have enough to settle the school fees for the next half of the year.\u201cCome in.\u201dStanding aside, she allowed Lu Sheng and the other two in.\u201cBam.\u201dThe main door shut tight and a beam was once again lowered across it.Song Yunjuan led the three of them towards the guest room.Song Yunjuan was rather ashamed by the fallen leaves and withered twigs that littered all over the ground. From the dilapidated scene, anybody could tell that this family had come to ruin.After sending each of them to their individual guest rooms, Song Yunjuan turned to return to rest.\u201cDong dong dong.\u201dSuddenly, someone else was again knocking on the door.\u201cI\u2019ll go take a look,\u201d Song Yunjuan ran over hurriedly to the main door. She wasn\u2019t that worried over whether Lu Sheng and the rest were the sort to loot the house; everything of value in the house had long since been emptied and sold by Big Bro. All that remained were old and broken miscellaneous items that even hoarders would despise.Lu Sheng followed the little girl running off, then surveyed the derelict courtyard and the sinister surroundings.\u201cIt\u2019s hard on this little lass.\u201d\u201cNever did I expect that someone actually lived here,\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an felt slightly nervous.\u201cWhat\u2019s so strange about people staying in this manor?\u201d Another among them, Ning San, was a choice man that Lu Sheng had specially selected for this expedition.They had disguised themselves as passers-by precisely to delve deeper into the situation within this Manor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Kurisu\u201cIt is strange indeed. There\u2019s never anyone seen coming or going to and from this Manor, nor is there anyone tidying the premises in the day. I wouldn\u2019t have thought that there were actually people staying here\u2026\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an explained in hushed tones.\u201cJust be careful. We\u2019re here to investigate the earlier missing persons case. We\u2019ll keep watch tonight and see what happens; most of those people went missing at night. I shall wait and see exactly what sort of thing can cause an expert like Wu San to disappear so mysteriously,\u201d clutching onto the hilt of his saber, Lu Sheng sat down quietly and closed his eyes.The other two, whose hearts were initially beginning to thump loudly in fear, calmed down significantly after seeing how their Boss didn\u2019t seem worried in the least.\u201cWith Young Master around, things will definitely go smoothly,\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an assured himself, at the same time also speaking for Ning San to hear.Ning San had been somewhat unsettled, but after hearing these words, he was more at peace.Lu Sheng sat upright on the bed as he usually did at home, beginning to circulate his inner Qi and closing his eyes to rest. On the surface, he seemed as still as a lake. However, his five senses remained on high alert as they took in his surroundings, taking utmost precautions.Similarly, Duan Meng\u2019an appeared to be resting, but actually remained on guard. Ning San likewise found a chair to rest in. Instead of splitting up into their rooms, all three of them remained in this one together instead. It was easier for them to look out for each other this way.Not long later, a flurry of activity could be heard from outside.It seemed that quite a few people had entered; most of their voices were female.\u201cLittle girl, where are the adults in your home? Why haven\u2019t they come out?\u201d A crisp female voice asked.\u201cMy Big Bro is concocting pills and can\u2019t be interrupted. Please lower your volume and don\u2019t bring the light out, or my Big Bro will be mad. It\u2019s really scary when he\u2019s angry,\u201d Song Yunjuan advised in a whisper.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re just here to stay the night. The mountain path has been obstructed by a landslide, so we really have no choice but to seek shelter here. We\u2019ll leave first thing in the morning,\u201d another woman said gently.\u201cThank you for your understanding,\u201d Song Yunjuan nodded, then seemed to be bringing the newcomers to their respective rooms.Lu Sheng stood up and opened the room\u2019s door to take a look outside. A row of men and women, torches in hand, was currently following Song Yunjuan towards the rooms opposite.Four women were in this band\u2013all Young Missus whose dressing clearly revealed that they weren\u2019t ordinary folk. Their appearances were comparable to the women in the circles Lu Sheng used to hang out with, who were children of wealthy families in the smaller cities in the countryside.The four women even brought along their four bodyguards, who were all thickly set men armed with sabers. However, merely a glance at their steps told Lu Sheng that these four were nothing more than ruffians with brute strength. Perhaps they knew a thing or two about saber basics, but in reality, their power was limited.The only place where Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze lingered for more than a moment was on one of the four women. She was young and looked pretty and cute, with pleasant features.That lady had a very comforting air about her, coming off as warm and harmless as a little white rabbit. It was very endearing. Instantly, Lu Sheng was reminded of Qiao\u2019er at home.Just as the three of them looked at the other party, the other group also noticed them.Seeing Lu Sheng and his men\u2019s build and composure, the four bodyguards immediately went on their guard. One of them whispered softly to his Young Miss. Very soon, all four of the Young Missus also looked in the direction of Lu Sheng with a strange expression on their faces.Not that they were feeling antsy, but one of the women, who looked meek and gentle, suddenly seemed like she wanted to give something a try.\u201cYoung Master, that woman has a knife hidden in her sleeves,\u201d Ning San whispered. He was referring to the gentle-looking girl.\u201cOh? You can tell?\u201d Lu Sheng arched his brow.\u201cYep. I suffered bitterly in the past. Afterwards, after observing for a long while, I was able to see through the regular patterns of people\u2019s behavior,\u201d even Ning San knew to analyze the patterns of behavior he observed. Such knowledge and learned insights typically fell within the domain of the aristocratic rich. For him to have such brains, it was no wonder that he was able to rise through the ranks to be a small leader in Crimson Whale Sect.\u201cShe must have had some training. Otherwise, it\u2019s unlikely that just a few women would dare to come out into the wilderness by themselves. If they met with any real danger, even having some bodyguards around would be of no good use. Besides, who knows, some of the bodyguards may also have ill intentions,\u201d Lu Sheng remarked lightly. He did not detect any brilliance in the gentle girl\u2019s eyes, which made it plain that she did not cultivate inner force. But Lu Sheng paid more attention to her movement and steps and surmised that her slender and gentle physique also made it unlikely that she was an outer force expert.\u201cNo need to bother with these people. However, there is someone else worth noting,\u201d Lu Sheng looked at a man standing at the back of the group.He was a young master with handsome features who carried himself elegantly and confidently. A white oil-paper umbrella in hand, he was dressed in long robes as white as snow which contrasted starkly with his jet-black hair. This gave him a suave and distinguished look, with the bearing of a dragon among men.What bothered Lu Sheng was that this young master was clearly not a part of the young women\u2019s group. Moreover, his eyes sparkled with a particular shine; apparently, he had cultivated inner force skills.\u201cBe careful, this person is trained in inner force,\u201d Lu Sheng cautioned, then returned to his bed to rest.As for Duan Meng\u2019an and Ning San, they both took a good, careful look at that Young Master and committed what they had heard to heart. Then, they closed the door and also returned to their respective places to rest.\u201cHOO\u2026\u201dA cold breeze howled about as the wooden door was slowly pushed open.Song Yunjuan coughed lightly before turning round to face that handsome young master and said, \u201cBig Brother Li, this room is for you. You\u2019ll find all you need in this room. Although some things are rather aged, I hope you won\u2019t mind.\u201dThat Young Master Li smiled and replied kindly, \u201cNo problem\u2013it\u2019s already a blessing that I have a somewhere to lay my head this evening. There\u2019s a chance of rain tonight; I\u2019m already beyond grateful that you, Young Sister, are willing to take me in.\u201dHis voice was pleasant and gentle as he spoke, and there was even an attractive and alluring quality about it. Song Yunjuan\u2019s face flushed slightly from shyness.\u201cIn that case\u2026 in that case, I\u2019ll take my leave. Have a good rest.\u201dYoung Master Li smiled and added, \u201cOh right, may I ask if the three men in the opposite room are also here to take shelter for the night?\u201dSong Yunjuan nodded, \u201cYep, they only just got here earlier. It\u2019s so strange, why are there so many people who came today all of a sudden?\u201dThe sparkle in Young Master Li\u2019s eyes flashed. Smilingly, he nodded, his expression as warm as before. \u201cThose three look like they\u2019re not to be trifled with, they look somewhat sinister.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Li, you think so too? I was quite afraid earlier. But with so many people who dropped in, I\u2019m not that frightened now,\u201d Song Yunjuan smiled lightly. \u201cYou get some rest, I\u2019ll be off to sleep too.\u201d\u201cMm, go on. You\u2019re still young, so take care of your health,\u201d Young Master Li looked at Song Yunjuan compassionately.\u201cMm,\u201d turning around, Song Yunjuan skipped away.Young Master Li waited till he saw her enter a large room in the middle and shut its doors before he turned to enter his room and shut it.\u201cInteresting.\u201dIn the dark, he slowly groped around for a piece of flint stone, which he struck to light up a candlestick within the sleeping quarters.A candle as thick as a forearm lit up and gave off a pale yellow glow. Then, a small lantern was lowered over it and covered the rays, causing the light to instantly grow softer.Young Master Li could hear the incessant chatter of the group of women next door. He shook his head lightly, \u2018Something seems fishy about this Manor. Light cannot be brought outside the room, and though there\u2019s a big bro, it\u2019s the younger sister who comes out to receive the guests.\u2019Li Shunxi\u2019s curiosity was somewhat piqued. He had come out for a stroll to relax, and had unexpectedly met with an obstruction on a nearby stretch of road. Left with no alternative, he had no choice but to seek shelter here for the night. Who knew that there would be such an intriguing matter.\u2018And then there are the three men opposite. They look like well-trained, muscular men who are obviously members of a sect. They even had identical symbols on their sleeves, though under the dim light it was impossible to see which sect it is. From the looks on their faces, it seems there\u2019s a problem with this Manor that they have come specifically to address.\u2019Li Shunxi\u2019s interest in the matter instantly grew even more.He was actually the young master of a government official\u2019s family. On the surface, he seemed like an ordinary young master, but he had picked up a few exorcist and demon-catching skills by himself. Additionally, he was gifted with innate intelligence and talent. Hence, he was able to learn several exceptional martial arts since young, resulting in an outstanding cultivation base. To top it all off, he had even ventured out of his house under cover and secretly resolved some incidents involving ghosts, accumulating quite a bit of experience.However, his high-ranking father actually had no idea that his youngest son had acquired such impressive skills.Li Shunxi concealed his abilities well on a day-to-day basis, without revealing even an inkling of his prowess. Only after sneaking out of the house in disguise did he dare to display his full strength to his heart\u2019s content.\u2018Looks like this trip hasn\u2019t been wasted,\u2019 Li Shunxi\u2019s interest was aroused. Sitting by the table, he began taking out his instruments from his waist pouch and inspecting them one by one.***In the middle of the night.Lu Sheng was sitting upright on the bed when suddenly, his eyes flashed open and glared at Ning San, who had wandered to the door.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cYoung Master, I\u2019m going to the latrine\u2026\u201d Ning San had a pained look on his face; clearly, he was afraid.\u201cAsk Duan Meng\u2019an to go with you,\u201d Lu Sheng instructed, \u201cDon\u2019t wander alone.\u201dDuan Meng\u2019an was presently sound asleep against the chair, drool dripping down his face.Left with no choice, Ning San could only go to wake him up.\u201cWHAT!? YOU WANT TO DIE!?\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an bellowed furiously, clearly pissed off at having been awoken. He opened his heavy-lidded eyes and was about to blow his top when, in that moment, he saw Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze bearing straight into his eyes. Lu Sheng\u2019s radiant eyes seemed to pierce like an arrow into his being, instantly jolting him awake from his slumber.\u201cAccompany him to the latrine, don\u2019t let him go alone,\u201d Lu Sheng instructed.\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an wiped away his drool and got up begrudgingly.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry Brother Duan,\u201d Ning San felt miserable. Duan Meng\u2019an flashed him a hateful glare, and they both left.\u201cKa-Cha.\u201d The door closed behind them and Lu Sheng once again closed his eyes.After about the time it takes for tealeaves to steep, the doors were slowly pushed open.\u201cChi\u2026\u201d\u201cBack?\u201d Lu Sheng asked casually, \u201cGet some rest. I\u2019ll keep watch for the time being.\u201dSilence.Lu Sheng opened his eyes and saw that the room\u2019s door was open. Gusts of cold wind poured in through the doors, but no one was to be seen. It seemed like the wind had blown the doors ajar.Frowning, he stood up and walked towards the door, gently shutting it.\u2018Why aren\u2019t those two back yet?\u2019As he shut the door, he suddenly felt some resistance, as if someone was pushing against it from the outside. He could very clearly sense that someone outside was shoving hard against the door, preventing him from opening it.His face darkened. Summoning all his strength, he pushed at the door hard and his entire body propelled outwards in escape.\u201cCHI!\u201dHis straight saber at his waist was already halfway out its hilt when he realized that there wasn\u2019t a single soul in sight.\u2018Superstitious bullshit!\u2019 Lu Sheng surveyed his surroundings, but as far as he could tell, the place was deserted. Without gathering a single clue, he finally returned to his room.Just as he prepared to sit down again, Lu Sheng felt that the other two had been gone for quite some time. After the earlier incident, he was now rather worried.\u2018I\u2019d better head out to take a look.\u2019He propped up a candlestick and hung a lantern cover over it to protect it from the wind. Then, carrying it in hand, he again opened the door.\u201cHOOOO.\u201dThe wind beyond the door was unexpectedly harsh and extinguished the candle in Lu Sheng\u2019s hand in the blink of an eye.Instantly, the room was cast in pitch-black darkness. Only the pale rays from the moon from outside streamed in.Lu Sheng quickly retrieved a flint stone and tried a couple more times. However, as before, the sparks were extinguished as soon as they were lit. Left with no other choice, Lu Sheng could only leave the candlestick behind in the room as he walked out and proceeded in the direction of the latrine.There was no trace of light anywhere in the pitch-black courtyard; it wasn\u2019t even clear whether the other guests had all fallen asleep or something else had happened to them. There wasn\u2019t a single sound to be heard from them.Slowly, Lu Sheng made his way outside, down the corridor. The latrine was commonly in the backyard of a house.He exited the corridor, entered the yard, went around the side of the entire sleeping quarters and then walked towards the backyard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Finding no one, he hastened his steps and went around the bedroom to the backyard. Two individual latrines were built in the backyard, isolated from the rest of the buildings.As Lu Sheng approached, he caught sight of a silhouette of a person standing outside the latrine. This person seemed to notice his arrival as well, and visibly put on their guard.\u201cWho\u2019s that?!\u201dLu Sheng was startled. He walked closer for a better look and realized it was the handsome Young Master who was also an inner force expert from previously.Presently, this man was gripping onto a short sword in his hand. His pupils sparkled brilliantly, clearly indicating his state of vigilance.\u201cThis Brother, did you come looking for missing people too?\u201d Li Shunxi asked after recognizing Lu Sheng.\u201cMissing people?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes narrowed. An apprehensive sense of foreboding crept up in his heart.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Don\u2019t you know, Brother?\u201d Li Shunxi stopped in surprise.\u201cMy two brothers went out of the room to visit the latrine. It\u2019s been a while but they haven\u2019t come back. I was worried and so came out to check on them,\u201d Lu Sheng explained simply. [1]Li Shunxi\u2019s faced turned dark, \u201cIn that case, two more people have gone missing.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, Brother?\u201d Lu Sheng took a few steps forward and peered into the latrines through the gap left by the ajar wooden doors. A foul stench drifted out from within, but the narrow space inside was thoroughly empty.Lu Sheng\u2019s face fell.\u201cYou mean\u2026 all those from earlier\u2026 the ladies and guards who came in with you\u2026\u201d\u201cHave all gone missing, without exception,\u201d Li Shunxi whispered. \u201cThere\u2019s so many of them. Perhaps they\u2019re trapped somewhere.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s try searching for them. The manor is merely of this size. Perhaps we can find some clues,\u201d Lu Sheng suggested. He licked his lips as frustration burned in his heart. He had lost two men before even laying sight on the true enemy.Li Shunxi nodded. The two of them made a quick round around the backyard and soon found a kitchen in its corner.Li Shunxi first shoved open the door and entered, short sword in hand.The wooden door swung open without a sound, revealing a dust-covered kitchen space.Overturned woks and shards of smashed porcelain covered the floor. Spider webs formed a thick cover over the stoves. Some rotten and decomposed leftovers were spilled all over the floor in a corner.\u201cHow long has this kitchen fallen out of use for?\u201d Li Shunxi frowned. He glanced at Lu Sheng and noticed that there wasn\u2019t much panic on his face. Evidently, this was not his first encounter with the supernatural.\u201cYou\u2019ve met with ghosts before, haven\u2019t you, Brother?\u201d He asked casually.Lu Sheng was surprised. This wealthy Young Master actually seemed pretty experienced.\u201cYes, I\u2019ve encountered such strange things in the past.\u201d\u201cNo wonder,\u201d Li Shunxi took a second glance at Lu Sheng. \u201cIn my opinion, the missing people have been temporarily trapped. There\u2019re so many of them. No matter how fast those things are, they won\u2019t kill them all so quickly. And I\u2019ve also checked earlier and didn\u2019t detect any traces of poison.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re certain of it, Brother?\u201d Lu Sheng asked.\u201cPretty much,\u201d Li Shunxi replied earnestly. He squatted and began to examine the footprints and marks on the ground.Perplexed, Lu Sheng followed him as he moved. Before long, they came to the entrance of the kitchen\u2019s underground cellar.\u201cI\u2019m surnamed Li. Named Shunxi. How may I address you, Brother?\u201d Li Shunxi grabbed the ring attached to the stone door that sealed the cellar and lifted it with great force.\u201cHOOOO.\u201dA foul odor gushed out at them.\u201cLast name Lu. Name\u2019s Sheng. Other name\u2013Yue Sheng,\u201d Lu Sheng answered concisely.After the stench cleared slightly, they peered into the cellar.Lu Sheng took out a flint stone and struck it hard. Yellow sparks burst out. In that momentary flash, both of them caught sight of a few bodies lying supine on the cellar ground.\u201cThey\u2019re here indeed!\u201d Li Shunxi heaved a sigh of relief, then jumped down swiftly. \u201cBrother Lu, guard the entrance for me.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Lu Sheng too breathed out in relief when he saw the bodies lying in there.Duan Meng\u2019an was indeed among them. Apart from him, there were two ladies and two guards. All of them appeared to be lying in the cellar in a coma.One by one, Li Shunxi lifted them out of the cellar. Lu Sheng took hold of them from him and laid them on the kitchen floor.Soon, the two of them had lifted all five unconscious bodies out of the cellar.\u201cThey\u2019re all still breathing,\u201d Li Shunxi put his cheek above one of the ladies\u2019 nose. \u201cHave you noticed what\u2019s wrong with them, Brother?\u201dHe looked at Lu Sheng and saw that his face remained impassive, his eyes steady. Instantly, Li Shunxi understood that Lu Sheng was no simple character either.\u201cBrother Li\u2019s got a way?\u201d Lu Sheng asked.\u201cNaturally. Watch this,\u201d pride briefly colored Li Shunxi\u2019s face as he took out a piece of paper-like black material. He bit on his index finger and dabbed his blood onto the paper.Then, he imprinted the material onto the foreheads of each of the unconscious bodies.Lu Sheng watched in silence, with neither a word nor movement. Before long, those lying on the floor came to their senses one by one.\u201cWhere am I?\u201d\u201cQingqing, are you alright?\u201d\u201cLittle Miss! Have you been hurt?\u201d\u201cYoung Master!\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an walked over to Lu Sheng with a face full of shame, his head hung low.\u201cEverything\u2019s fine as long as you\u2019re alright. Where\u2019s Ning San?\u201d Lu Sheng asked.\u201c\u2026\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an\u2019s head lowered even lower, not daring to look Lu Sheng in the face.Lu Sheng\u2019s face remained composed, but his eyes grew colder. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk when we get back.\u201dHowever, Li Shunxi suggested, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should split up now.\u201d\u201cA million thanks to both of you. I\u2019m Gong Ruqing. This is my sister Gong Rumeng. If it hadn\u2019t been for your rescue, we probably wouldn\u2019t see daylight again,\u201d the mild-mannered lady who had hid a sword in her sleeves was among them.Her sister was that girl who was as cute as Qiao\u2019er.\u201cThank you once again, Young Masters, for your rescue. But we\u2019ve still got companions trapped in here. Can we request your help once more to find our remaining companions?\u201d Gong Ruqing\u2019s sister, Gong Rumeng pleaded. \u201cWe know we\u2019re asking for too much. But as compensation, we\u2019re willing to offer notes worth a hundred taels of gold.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Li Shunxi\u2019s brows arched as he glanced towards Lu Sheng. Among all present, only Lu Sheng was someone he was unable to see through. Looking at his dressing, he seemed like someone from a wealthy family. Li Shunxi guessed that he was more or less the same as himself\u2013someone who lived by an alias, but was in actual fact an expert harboring extraordinary skills.As the Young Master of a wealthy family, many details such as one\u2019s bearing and dressing could not be altered so easily. Given Li Shunxi\u2019s keen and perceptive powers of observation, he had long since detected the difference between Lu Sheng and the two men beside him.On most days, he was shut in the manor. Moreover, because he had many rivals, he had had to hide his true strength to hide some cards up his sleeves. Consequently, he had always lacked the opportunity to interact with the world outside and had no idea what level his strength reached.Now that he had run into a peer in similar straits as himself\u2013a Young Master in disguise who hid powerful and extraordinary skills\u2013his heart was itching for some serious sparring. He desperately wanted to exchange pointers with him.\u201cWhat does Brother Lu think? Shall we help?\u201d Li Shunxi gazed at Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng\u2019s face was dark. He had to admit that this Li Shunxi had some methods. He took another glance at him.\u201cOkay.\u201dHe had come to investigate this manor in the first place. Little did he expect that he would lose one of his men before even figuring out what was wrong with this place. This irked him and made him reluctant to leave just like that.\u201cAlright then. I agree too,\u201d Li Shunxi smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Since you were taken to this cellar from your rooms, there must be traces left behind in your rooms. Let\u2019s go back and take a look.Of course, the most essential thing is to first find that young girl. She\u2019s one of the owners of this manor. She and that pill-concocting Big Brother of hers, I heard.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! It must be that little girl\u2019s fault! And her brother must be an evil person too! If we see them, we\u2019ve got to arrest them first!\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an shouted in an uproar.\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d Lu Sheng glared at him.Immediately, shivers ran down Duan Meng\u2019an\u2019s spine. Not a word came from him again.The group assented to Li Shunxi\u2019s suggestion and rapidly made a beeline for the middle room in the courtyard.In the pitch darkness, the courtyard was deserted. The group came to the main bedroom.\u201cBoom boom boom!\u201dForceful knocks rang out. Dust was shaken off the top of the door frame and caught in the wind, causing some coughs among the group.\u201cOpen up!\u201dAnother few knocks.\u201cKa-cha.\u201dThe room\u2019s door swung open by itself.Li Shunxi glanced at the two guards shaking in fear, then stepped into the room.Lu Sheng was the second to enter. Only then did the rest of the group hurry to enter.\u201cIs there anybody here?\u201d Li Shunxi grabbed onto something and hid it in his sleeve as he shouted at the top of his voice.In the left part of the room, a giant pill cauldron sat there. In the right part was dust-covered and weather-beaten furniture, including a bed. It was thoroughly deserted. An icy coldness permeated the room.The bold Gong Ruqing walked up to the bed and pulled back the bed curtains.\u201cBOO!\u201dWithout warning, a ball of black shadow pounced out of the bed.\u201cSTRIKE!\u201d Li Shunxi hurled his hand outwards, hitting the black shadow with precision.A blood-curdling scream rang out from the black shadow, then it fell onto the ground with a strange infant-like shriek. It was a fist-sized black bat!Gong Ruqing jumped in fright and retreated quite a few steps backwards. A trace of blood hung by the side of the bat\u2019s mouth.\u201cWhy\u2019d there be a bat in this place???\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a Yin Bat. Heheh, no ordinary place can breed this stuff,\u201d Li Shunxi looked at Lu Sheng with a faint smugness on his face.But seeing Lu Sheng\u2019s dark face which remained impassive, without any hint of surprise or amazement, his heart fell into disappointment.\u201cDoes Brother Lu have any expert insights?\u201d He asked.Lu Sheng glanced at him and replied calmly, \u201cNone. Brother Li\u2019s methods are impressive indeed. I\u2019m impressed. Nonetheless, we should find those still missing as soon as we can. I doubt we\u2019ll find that little girl and her Big Brother anytime soon.\u201dLi Shunxi narrowed his eyes at Lu Sheng, attempting to guess what he had discovered. But he didn\u2019t ask. \u201cLet\u2019s go then. Since the Yin Bat came out, I think we\u2019re not far away.\u201dNot having found anyone, the group exited the main bedroom and began searching the other rooms one by one.In the process, Li Shunxi killed five more Yin Bats in a row. One of them was simply too fast and managed to land a savage bite on a guard\u2019s neck, almost killing him.Had it not been for Li Shunxi\u2019s quick reflexes, the guard would not have been able to keep his life.Thereafter, all of them, including Gong Ruqing and Gong Rumeng, grew in admiration of and dependence on Li Shunxi. The admiration of two pretty ladies made Li Shunxi especially smug.He kept glancing at Lu Sheng, but saw no reaction from him. Only, his face seemed to grow more and more solemn as minutes ticked by without them being able to find any trace of the missing people.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The rooms around them were all empty, without any movement or light in them.\u201cSomeone\u2019s not here yet. Where\u2019s that Miss Gong Rumeng?\u201d He suddenly remarked.Startled, all of them realized that Gong Rumeng was not in the group. Gong Ruqing, however, was a face of perplexity.\u201cIsn\u2019t my sister right behind me?\u201d She asked. She had sensed someone following behind her all the way, and had even exchanged a few words with her sister just a few moments ago.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Lu Sheng gazed at her.At this moment, all of them also turned their gaze on to Gong Ruqing.Behind her stood a woman in a white dress. But her face was covered by Gong Ruqing\u2019s hair and so none of them could see her face and simply assumed that she was Gong Rumeng.Presently, the woman stood behind Gong Ruqing\u2019s back silently, stiff as a statue, her arms hanging by her sides.\u201cBut she\u2019s clearly behind me\u2026\u201d Gong Ruqing\u2019s face turned as pale as paper when she saw how everyone\u2019s eyes fell on the area behind her and turned into looks of fright and horror.If the one behind her wasn\u2019t her sister Gong Rumeng, then who on earth was this woman who had followed her all this while?Gong Ruqing\u2019s hair stood on ends and goosebumps appeared all over her, from head to toe.Trembling, she slowly turned around.\u201cDon\u2019t turn around!!!\u201d Li Shunxi dashed forward like an arrow and gripped tightly onto Gong Ruqing\u2019s shoulders, pulling her towards himself.\u201cBoom!\u201dBoth of them collided against each other.Simultaneously, some silver sparks flew out from Li Shunxi\u2019s hand. A dart seemed to fly towards the woman in white.Just then, everyone\u2019s vision blurred and the woman in white had vanished without a trace in the blink of an eye.The silver spark landed on the ground and spun a few rounds before coming to a stop. It was a palm-sized silver top.Li Shunxi was pinned to the ground by Gong Ruqing. Both of them were in an extremely awkward position, with Gong Ruqing arms clutching onto him for her dear life in fright like an octopus\u2019 tentacles.\u201cMiss Qingqing, it\u2019s alright now. It\u2019s alright now\u2026 will you let go of me first?\u201d Li Shunxi did not know whether to laugh or to cry.Only then did everyone come to their senses. The two guards hurried forward to help the two of them up.Lu Sheng\u2019s brows were locked in a tight knot. Beside him, Duan Meng\u2019an was scared out of his wits, his whole body covered in cold sweat and tremors.\u201cB\u2026Boss\u2026 let\u2019s get out of this manor first\u2026\u201dLu Sheng glared at him without a reply. No one had caught sight of the woman in white\u2019s face or how she had disappeared earlier.That Li Shunxi\u2019s stuff must have worked.\u201cThat was a Soul of the Will. No one should split away now\u2026 it\u2019s hard to explain how dangerous these Souls of the Will are. Anyway, from this point onwards, please do not fall out of a ten-meter radius from me,\u201d Li Shunxi instructed after getting to his feet. \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, it\u2019s highly likely that the key to this Manor are these withered trees,\u201d he pointed his finger at the withered tree in the courtyard as he said softly.Lu Sheng looked at him. \u201cBrother Li, care to share your insights?\u201dLi Shunxi explained calmly, \u201cTo find those who have gone missing, perhaps we\u2019ve got to first destroy all the withered trees in this Manor.\u201d\u201cWithered trees?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s face remained impassive.\u201cI suspect that these trees are the source and origin of the formation in this Manor. So one of our tasks is to destroy these withered trees. The other task is the locate a metallic object in the central bedroom from earlier. That should be the true eye of the formation in this Manor,\u201d Li Shunxi continued.\u201cWe can try walking in the direction of the Manor\u2019s exit,\u201d Lu Sheng interrupted abruptly.Li Shunxi paused and looked Lu Sheng in the eye.\u201cLooks like Brother Lu disagrees with me. Leaving the Manor now won\u2019t do any good.\u201d\u201cWe can try,\u201d Lu Sheng said flatly.Li Shunxi stared at Lu Sheng for a moment before slowly nodding.\u201cAlright then. Since Brother Lu says so\u2026 we can also escort these people who can\u2019t help much out of the Manor and guarantee their safety first.\u201d\u201cBut my sister\u2026!\u201d Gong Ruqing\u2019s pretty face was pale as she insisted.\u201cWe\u2019ll come back to look for her,\u201d Li Shunxi consoled her with a smile and extended his arms over her in an embrace, pulling her to his chest.Gong Ruqing\u2019s face turned red. But she was completely at a loss of what to do now and Li Shunxi was the only one she could rely on. Moreover, one look at Li Shunxi showed that this man was either wealthy or an aristocrat and had probably come from a family even better than her own. It was very natural for her to be moved.Pulled into embrace, Gong Ruqing struggled slightly and stopped resisting, allowing him to hug her gently.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. With me and Brother Lu here, your sister is sure to be fine,\u201d Li Shunxi guaranteed with a smile.\u201cMm!\u201d Gong Ruqing nodded lightly.The guards around them heaved a sigh of relief. This Manor was simply way too strange. Had it not been for the fact that both of them did not dare to leave on their own, they would have left their Young Miss behind and escaped. Hence, they naturally were in favor of leaving now.Duan Meng\u2019an too was overjoyed and breathed out in relief.Having established a consensus, they began heading for the Manor\u2019s main exit.Halfway there, all of them started sensing that something was amiss.The Manor\u2019s gates were clearly not far in the distance. But even after several hundred steps, they were still more than ten meters away from the gates.Li Shunxi\u2019s eyes narrowed, then he looked at Lu Sheng. See? He was right after all.\u201cYoung Master\u2026\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an was shaking as he followed close after Lu Sheng. \u201cHave we\u2026 have we\u2026 run into ghosts\u2026?\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s face was dark. He kept silent.\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong indeed!\u201dLi Shunxi stood aside and said coldly, \u201cThere should still be something fishy going on in that underground cellar. I intend to take another look at it. Are you coming along, Brother Lu? That should be the nexus of this Manor.\u201dLu Sheng shook his head slightly.\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019m staying put.\u201dLi Shunxi stopped in surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re serious, Brother Lu?\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d Lu Sheng replied earnestly.Li Shunxi gazed at Lu Sheng carefully, then smiled. \u201cFine, then. Please decide who you will follow. I\u2019m headed to the cellar. Brother Lu is staying put here.\u201dGong Ruqing and her two guards looked from left to right, and from right to left.On one side was Li Shunxi, handsome as jade, exuding an extraordinary aura. On the other side was Lu Sheng, his face dark and grim.\u201cThis humble girl will follow Young Master Li,\u201d Gong Ruqing resolutely chose Li Shunxi.\u201cThen we\u2019ll stick with Young Master Li as well!\u201d The two guards added hurriedly. Li Shunxi had earlier demonstrated a series of impressive skills. Compared with the dumb and stuffy Lu Sheng, he was clearly much more convincing and credible.Duan Meng\u2019an\u2019s body wavered slightly, wishing to go over as well. But he looked at Lu Sheng, standing before him, and had no guts to move.The result was Li Shunxi\u2019s side had four people, while Lu Sheng\u2019s side only two.Both were decked in rich Young Master\u2019s clothing, but the number of their companions differed plainly.\u201cIn that case, here\u2019s wishing Brother Lu peace and safety as you hang around here,\u201d Li Shunxi\u2019s tone carried with it certain shades of meaning. Turning around, he led the rest towards the backyard.Looks of despise flashed across the faces of Gong Ruqing and the rest. \u2018This Young Master Lu\u2019s clearly got no guts. He just wants to save his own butt. Young Master Li\u2019s eager to rescue the missing persons, but he\u2026 he pales in comparison.\u2019Lu Sheng watched silently as the rest left.Li Shunxi walked to the side of the house. His pretty almond-shaped eyes looked deep in thought. He couldn\u2019t figure out why Lu Sheng would suddenly decide to wait by the exit.In such circumstances, there was no use at all in just standing guard by the exit. In fact, that would just be a waste of time.\u2018I wonder what\u2019s going on in Brother Lu\u2019s mind\u2026 to think that he-\u2018 before he could finish, a sudden acute sense of danger gushed towards him from behind his back. He quickly turned his head back.Behind him was a patch of thick darkness. It was as silent as a cemetery, deathly still and empty.Where were Gong Ruqing and the others who were just following behind him a few seconds ago? Could it be that they all have gone missing just like that??\u201cMiss Qingqing?\u201d Li Shunxi called out as his heart lurched.His voice reverberated across the Manor in the night. But there was no response.\u201cAn illusion?\u201d A yellow talisman paper appeared swiftly in his hand. He threw it forward lightly and accurately pierced through it with his index finger.Immediately, the scales fell from his eyes. Gong Ruqing and the rest appeared around him once again, each of them standing stiffly, rooted to the ground. Only their eyeballs spun madly in their eye sockets, their pupils dilated, unable to focus in the slightest.One glance at them told Li Shunxi that they were all trapped in an illusion. In similar fashion, he took out talisman papers and pointed at them one by one.\u201cMiss Qingqing, are you alright?\u201d Quickly, he held onto Gong Ruqing, whose body had turned limp and weak.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m alright\u2026\u201d Gong Ruqing\u2019s pretty face was deathly white. She was clearly terrified.After propping up Gong Ruqing, however, Li Shunxi once again fell deep in thought. If someone had cast an illusion in his vicinity, he ought to have had detected it. But even he had fallen for the illusion earlier, without noticing it in the slightest.\u201cYoung Master, if it hadn\u2019t been for you earlier\u2026\u201d tears streaming down her face, Gong Ruqing drew near him, her curvaceous body almost sticking onto him.That soft gentle touch sent sparks in Li Shunxi\u2019s mind. The urge to reach out and touch Gong Ruqing\u2019s crucial part consumed his mind.\u201cCHI!\u201dWithout warning, a grimace flashed across his face and he pushed Gong Ruqing away forcefully.A streak of silver flashed between the two of them. Gong Ruqing was gripping onto a short sword and slashed violently at his chest!It was a good thing that he had noticed it in time, hence suffering only a skin-deep gash across his chest. Although blood trickled down from it without end, it wasn\u2019t a mortal wound.\u201cMiss Qingqing\u2026! You\u2026!?\u201d Without time to spare for a further thought, he saw Gong Ruqing stabbing her short sword into the abdomen of one of the guards beside her.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?! Young Master Li, help me!!!\u201d Shock and fear flashed across Gong Ruqing\u2019s face. She seemed unable to control her own body, waving the short sword all around in a frenzy. She shoved away the man who had been caught off-guard violently, and then pounced at Li Shunxi.Li Shunxi blocked on his left and dodged to his right. But Gong Ruqing\u2019s skills had turned extremely powerful in an instant. After exchanging several blows, he was the one who seemed to be on the losing end!He clenched his teeth and took out a dark golden hammer from his waist pouch. Intricate and complex patterns were carved onto its surface.But seeing the tear-streaked Gong Ruqing, he couldn\u2019t muster the will to do it. After all, this lady was merely being possessed. Wouldn\u2019t he be murdering a life with his own hands if he struck her?In that moment of hesitation, he was viciously slashed again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although he had methods to exorcise bodily possessions, they required the possessed party to be immobilized. Without any help, presently, he was out of moves.He kept ducking and dodging until he suddenly heard quick footsteps heading nearer towards him.Li Shunxi hurriedly looked towards the sound of the footsteps to see the emotionless Lu Sheng walk out of the pitch darkness.Li Shunxi was seized by joy.\u201cBrother Lu! Come lend a hand!\u201dWithout the slightest change in his expression, Lu Sheng glanced at Li Shunxi who was busy rolling around on the ground, a straight-back saber in his hand.\u201cSAVE ME!!!\u201d Gong Ruqing pounced on Lu Sheng as well, lines of tears streaking across her face. Her clothes had been ripped and torn to shreds by now, revealing much of her body.\u201cQuick! Help me press her down! I\u2019ve got a way to dispel the possession!!!\u201d Li Shunxi leapt up from the ground and dashed towards Gong Ruqing.\u201cNine refinements return souls to rest, heavenly peace in yellow pagoda\u2026\u201d\u201cSPLAT!!!\u201dBefore Li Shunxi could finish his sutra, Lu Sheng\u2019s saber had completed a diagonal slash.In the darkness, the bright saber gleam split Gong Ruqing into halves from top to toe, like a stream of spring water jetting across the air, clear and pure.In a split second, the crescent-shaped saber gleam had hacked a living beauty into two pieces. Li Shunxi did not even have time to react when he saw the ground beneath Lu Sheng\u2019s feet cave in as all the muscles on him bulged and expanded rapidly, ripping his clothes to shreds. A red line stretched from his chest to his crown, forming the shape of the character for blood [\u8840] in the area between his eyes.\u201cSWOOSH!\u201dWith a wave of his long saber, a thick gust of wind howled in the backyard like a typhoon. Lu Sheng smashed the back of his saber into a guard, sending him flying across the air, before charging towards Li Shunxi in two strides.Just at that moment, a shadow shot forward from Li Shunxi\u2019s side.\u201cBOOM!!!\u201dTwo immensely powerful figures collided squarely with each other in midair.\u201cROAR!!!\u201d\u201cSHRIEK!!!\u201dAt almost the same moment, ear-piercing and deafening roars rang out from both of them. Then, like two ferocious beasts, they pounced at each other again.\u201cDANG DANG DANG!!!\u201dThundering clashes rang out, shaking Li Shunxi to the core till his limbs were limp.\u201cKA-CHA!\u201dA streak of lightning flashed across the sky, lighting up the two who were exchanging blows.Compared to previously, Lu Sheng\u2019s body had expanded by a fold. Thick bands of muscles covered his body, veins popping up in them. He swung the straight-backed saber at his opponent in a frenzy, smashing like it was a hammer.And yet the other person was able to receive every one of those blows!Li Shunxi stared at the other person and almost cried out in shock.\u201cSoul\u2026 Soul of the Dead!!!\u201d He broke out in cold sweat.\u201cRun!\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an dashed out of nowhere and hurriedly grabbed him, pulling him away.The remaining guard was presently as pale as a ghost. He quickly followed the two of them, running away from the site of the battle.The one currently locked in combat with Lu Sheng was grayish black all over. His skin was completely exposed, rotting muscles and gangrenous blood vessels visible through it.His eyes were a patch of white. His stature was taller than the average person\u2019s, and looked rather skinny and frail. And yet, his explosive strength was horrifyingly powerful!Lu Sheng activated all his skills madly; Blood Fury Skill was activated to its maximum speed at his peak. And yet he could only achieve a draw against the opponent.\u201cDANG!\u201dAnother saber strike hacked at the opponent. Incredulously, the razor-sharp blade left no wound at all on this man\u2019s body despite Lu Sheng\u2019s massive strength behind it.\u201cI\u2019m not buying it!!!\u201d Savagery arose in Lu Sheng\u2019s heart. He was about to activate Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill.\u201cRun! That\u2019s a Soul of the Dead. It\u2019s got skin of copper and bones of iron. It\u2019s indestructible!\u201d Li Shunxi\u2019s anxious voice rang out from afar.\u201cSoul of the Dead? Indestructible?\u201d The \u201cblood\u201d character on Lu Sheng\u2019s forehead grew much more distinct. He gripped onto the saber with both hands, channeling power from his entire body and accumulating it in one spot.\u201cTIGER KILL!!!\u201d Black Tiger Saber Technique was his only Intent Proficiency saber technique, as well as his most powerful attack.This Tiger Kill carried Lu Sheng\u2019s accumulated Blood Fury Skill inner Qi. Under the moonlight, it burst out like a lightning bolt and landed on top of the Soul of the Dead\u2019s head.\u201cDANG!!!\u201dThe trembling blade vibrated and trembled atop the Soul of the Dead\u2019s head.\u201cBOOM!!!\u201dUnder the compression of immense force, the blade exploded into countless shards on the Soul of the Dead\u2019s body!Innumerable shards burst out like rain. Lu Sheng threw aside the saber hilt. His hands turned crimson like blood as he smashed them into the Soul of the Dead\u2019s head continuously with a series of Heart-Shattering Palm attacks.\u201cDIE!!!\u201d Lu Sheng roared like an insane beast, ramming his palms straight into the Soul of the Dead\u2019s face with his entire body\u2019s might under the activation of Blood Fury Skill.After his last palm strike, Lu Sheng flew back and landed, staring at the Soul of the Dead, whose face had been hit into a concavity by his palms.\u201cROAR!!!\u201dThe Soul of the Dead had been slammed into flying backwards, countless broken blade shards pierced into his body. It was a terrible sight to behold. It roared in anger, then fell and rolled on the ground. Its body was burning hot like a steam cage, white steam and a charred stench rising up from his head.\u201cRoar!!!\u201dRolling on the ground, the Soul of the Dead gave its final roar, and then dissolved into a puddle of black water.Wisps of steam still rose from Lu Sheng\u2019s palms. He breathed out at length after landing, the vapor in his breath like smog. Only after seven or eight deep exhalations did he finally breathe out all the smoke from within him.His body was also gradually reverting to its original size and shape, and the red \u201cblood\u201d character on his forehead was dissipating.\u201cYou alright, Brother Li?\u201d Lu Sheng turned back to look at Li Shunxi who was standing beside Duan Meng\u2019an.Li Shenxi stared dumbfounded, his face as red as beetroot. He had yet to recover from the earlier scene of savagery. \u201cAl\u2026 alright\u2026 thanks for coming to rescue\u2026 Brother Lu,\u201d he stammered in reply.After finally regaining his wits, a sudden anguish seized him at the thought of the mutilated Gong Ruqing. \u201cHow can Brother Lu take lives so callously and treat them like dirt?! Miss Gong Ruqing was a living person! Since Brother Lu possessed such power right from the start, why didn\u2019t you use it earlier!?\u201dLu Sheng had walked to them by then, a new outer coat on him.\u201cWhat power? I don\u2019t know any supernatural skills or magic arts. And was that Gong Ruqing? Hasn\u2019t she turned into a ghost after being possessed?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know? Brother Lu, are you kidding me? You don\u2019t know and yet you could kill a living Soul of the Dead?\u201d Li Shunxi exclaimed in anger.\u201cI don\u2019t know whatever \u2018soul\u2019 or \u2018dead\u2019. As long as it\u2019s a freak, I\u2019ll smack it till it\u2019s dead. Isn\u2019t it as simple as that?\u201d Lu Sheng looked at him, perplexed.\u201cA possessed body is a possessed body! A ghost is a ghost! A possessed body is just a body possessed by a ghost. As long as the ghost is expelled, the body is still a living person!\u201d Li Shunxi croaked.\u201cA possessed body is a ghost. And a ghost must die,\u201d Lu Sheng corrected him in all earnestness.\u201cBut that\u2019s a person! A LIVING PERSON!\u201d Li Shunxi seemed to have forgotten Lu Sheng\u2019s earlier ferocity, arguing heatedly, sticking to his own logic.\u201cWhatever\u2019s a danger to me is a ghost,\u201d Lu Sheng replied. \u201cYou should count yourself lucky you weren\u2019t possessed,\u201d he looked at Li Shunxi emotionlessly.Shivers ran down Li Shunxi\u2019s spine. He still had his piece to say, but could no longer find the guts to do so.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Lu Sheng headed towards the cellar in the backyard.\u201cBoss, here\u2019s a saber,\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an quickly handed over his saber. In his hand was yet another saber which he had picked up from the guard.Lu Sheng took the saber and strode towards the kitchen.The few of them approached the kitchen, then traced the earlier route to the cellar.Lu Sheng lifted open the cellar door and saw several more people lying inside indeed. They were Ning San, who had gone missing, as well as the two remaining guards and two more ladies.\u201cIt\u2019s not wise to stay here any longer. We need to get out immediately,\u201d Lu Sheng said flatly. \u201cSee if these people can be woken up.\u201d\u201cBrother Lu, did you already know that a Soul of the Dead was lurking beside me since earlier?\u201d Only now did Li Shunxi have the opportunity to ask.\u201cMm. I sensed something was amiss, but couldn\u2019t tell who it was at that time. So I thought I might as well split up with you. As expected, it revealed itself once we split up,\u201d Lu Sheng explained simply.Ever since rescuing the Gong Ruqing sisters, he had a peculiar feeling that something was off.\u201cHow can Souls of the Dead have such intelligence\u2026 to think that they even know how to disguise themselves and lie in hiding\u2026\u201d Li Shunxi shivered. Realizing how close he had been to a Soul of the Dead for such a long time gave him the creeps.\u201cThen how about Gong Rumeng?\u201d Li Shunxi\u2019s mind was in a mess.\u201cEither dead or missing. No idea,\u201d Lu Sheng replied apathetically, \u201cWhether they\u2019re dead or alive is irrelevant to me. I\u2019m simply here to investigate a case.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 how can you be so cold-blooded!?\u201d Li Shunxi burst out.\u201cCold-blooded? They\u2019re neither kith nor kin to me. How\u2019s that cold-blooded?\u201d Lu Sheng replied, perturbed.Li Shunxi was entirely at a loss of words, unable to refute him.Together with Duan Meng\u2019an, he lifted the people out from the cellar one by one and slapped them awake. Lu Sheng watched from the side without lifting a finger.Everyone gradually came to.\u201cI was just resting in the room\u2026 how did I get here all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why am I here now?\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s Qingqing and Mengmeng? Why don\u2019t I see them?\u201dThe group of ladies and guards panicked after waking up.\u201cWe should get out of this place first,\u201d Li Shunxi proposed.\u201cYoung Master Li, may I know if you\u2019ve seen Qingqing and Mengmeng?\u201d One of the ladies asked Li Shunxi.Li Shunxi looked down without courage to look them in the face.\u201cLet\u2019s talk after we get out,\u201d he said softly.Lu Sheng, on the other hand, swept his gaze across them, then looked at Ning San.\u201cYoung Master!\u201d Ning San ran over and bowed his head before Lu Sheng.\u201cGood to see that you\u2019re not dead. Alright, let\u2019s go,\u201d Lu Sheng said indifferently.Ning San nodded in shame.\u201cHang on! Where\u2019s our Young Miss? Did you do something to her!?\u201d One of the guards dashed over and blocked Lu Sheng angrily.\u201cThat\u2019s right! We woke up here, so it\u2019s got to be these two!\u201d The other guard dashed over as well and said severely to Li Shunxi, \u201cYoung Master Li, please assist us in arresting this man!\u201dLu Sheng gazed at the two blocking the path, then looked at the awkward Li Shunxi.\u201cAre you coming?\u201d He asked callously.For some reason, despite the number of people present, Li Shunxi felt keenly that Lu Sheng\u2019s question was directed at him alone.\u201cI go? Then how about them?\u201d He asked.\u201cThey belong here in the first place,\u201d Lu Sheng replied.At those words, all commotion was silenced in an instant. It was as if the volume had been turned off.Be it the guards or the ladies, eccentric smiles emerged on their faces.Terror seized Li Shunxi\u2019s heart. A keen sense of danger madly flooded his mind. With all his might, he leapt over to Lu Sheng\u2019s side.Then he turned back to look at the ladies and guards again.\u201cYoung Master Li\u2026 you\u2019ve got to redress our grievances\u2026 it\u2019s that man, that man killed our Young Miss\u2026\u201d the guard who had spoken earlier cried out loudly. But, the ashen hue of death colored his face now.\u201cYoung Master Li\u2026\u201dA \u201cka-cha\u201d sound rang out behind him. The kitchen door had been opened. A gruesome, distorted figure limped slowly through the door.\u201cYoung Master Li, Qingqing\u2019s body is hurting so badly. Why did you leave by yourself\u2026 you didn\u2019t wait for Qingqing\u2026\u201dThe Gong Ruqing that had been hacked into two halves appeared at the door! Presently, a long and fine blood-red crack line remained down the middle of her body, right along where she had been hacked into two pieces.Li Shunxi\u2019s face immediately turned a sick green.\u201cAH!!!\u201d Frightened by the sight, Duan Meng\u2019an shoved the guard beside him away. That guard too was ashen-faced and an odious stench was being emitted from him.Cold sweat broke out on Ning San\u2019s forehead. The thought of how he had slept beside a pile of zombie-like corpses for such a long time made him shiver in disgust.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Lu Sheng strode towards the kitchen door without so much as a glance at the band of guards and ladies.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Both halves of her body split from each other, falling to each side.\u201cYoung Master Li\u2026 Young Master Li!!! Qingqing\u2019s in pain\u2026\u201dLi Shunxi\u2019s face turned green as he hurried to keep up with Lu Sheng. Duan Meng\u2019an and Ning San too broke out in cold sweat as they followed along.Lu Sheng barely strode out of the kitchen when he felt a powerful gust of air blowing in his face.Lightning quick, he lifted his saber across his body as a shield.\u201cDANG!!!\u201dA deafening collision reverberated all over. Lu Sheng was driven back several steps, shockingly sent off balance by a pitch-black silhouette!\u201cAnother Soul of the Dead!?\u201d Li Shunxi was shocked to see the black figure. What on earth was this Manor for two Souls of the Dead to appear within it, one after another? Before this, he had seen such supernatural beings only in books!These supernatural beings were indestructible, built with skin of bronze and bones of iron. Fire was their only Achilles\u2019 heel. They were basically the hardest to deal with among ghosts. And to think that they would run into one after another right here!As Li Shunxi was frozen in his steps with astonishment, Lu Sheng had already locked himself in combat with the second Soul of the Dead.After a series of intense collisions, both black figures smashed through the kitchen wall on the right and fell through it.Duan Meng\u2019an supported Li Shunxi, dashing out of the kitchen with Ning San. Behind them, a whole gang of ghosts\u2013Young Misses and guards\u2013were hot on their heels.These ghosts were extremely fast. One of them clawed Duan Meng\u2019an fiercely in his back, penetrating his hard body skill in an instant and leaving five streaks of bloody wounds.\u201cAH!\u201dDuan Meng\u2019an screamed hoarsely, his steps increasing in speed.Li Shunxi and Ning San had no ability to stop and care for him; they too doubled their pace as they sped towards the Manor\u2019s exit.\u201cBOOM!!!\u201dIn the middle of the backyard, Lu Sheng slammed his right palm, crimson like blood, into the chest of the Soul of the Dead. At the same time, the Soul of the Dead\u2019s foot landed heavily on his abdomen. A flash of blood surged up Lu Sheng\u2019s face. Clearly, he received internal injuries.\u201cDIE!!!\u201d Lu Sheng clutched and pulled back the Soul of the Dead\u2019s head, baring its neck. Gripping his straight saber like a vice in his other hand, he slashed across it without hesitation.\u201cSPLAT!!!\u201dA jet of ink-black blood sprayed all over him.\u201cBOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!!!\u201d The Soul of the Dead struggled in a fit, landing punches and kicks on Lu Sheng\u2019s body till Lu Sheng\u2019s face turned an unnatural red.Lu Sheng had already activated Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill, supplemented by Yin Yang Attraction, rapidly healing the injuries within him.Given the dire situation, he had no choice but to resort to exchanging blow for blow in a bid to dispatch the Soul of the Dead in the shortest time possible. Otherwise, as time dragged on, who knew what fishy business this Manor would sneak up on them again.Although the Soul of the Dead\u2019s incessant blows caused rather significant injuries to Lu Sheng, they weren\u2019t irreversible. Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill\u2019s special effect was homeostasis, after all. The moment a blood vessel burst, blood loss was immediately stemmed by his inner force. A few days were all it took for it to heal afterwards; thus, the multiple wounds on Lu Sheng were no worse than a few cuts on the finger to him.Had it not been for his worry that it would consume too much of his inner force and leave him dry, Lu Sheng would long have had used his Tiger Roar &amp; Crane Song Saber. One strike of that technique would have sent this Soul of the Dead to oblivion.\u201cBoss! Let\u2019s go!!!\u201d In the distance, Duan Meng\u2019an turned and yelled. They had exploited the opportunity to make a run for the distance and were presently going around the house for the courtyard in front of them.Lu Sheng sent the Soul of the Dead flying with one palm strike. Without waiting for it to dissolve, he stomped hard on the ground, borrowing the force of the impact to launch himself forwards into the air.With a few big strides, he caught up with the three of them and they all made a run for the Manor exit.\u201cWhy must we go through the main exit? Can\u2019t we just climb over the walls?\u201d Ning San asked.\u201cNo, we can\u2019t! This is a Ghost Formation. Going across the wall will land us back in the kitchen cellar. That\u2019s where the core of the formation is! Quick! Destroy that tree!\u201d Entering the courtyard, Li Shunxi pointed to the withered tree right in its middle, beside the stone bridge, and yelled.\u201cBAM!\u201dWith all his might, Duan Meng\u2019an smashed himself into the black withered tree, which was as thick as a forearm, breaking its trunk in the middle. The top half of the tree bent over backwards, collapsing onto the ground.Duan Meng\u2019an himself was knocked out of his bearings by the impact. Ning San carried him and the gang rushed towards the Manor\u2019s exit.With a backhand slash, Lu Sheng smacked a ghost guard in pursuit into the ground.\u201cAHHH!!!\u201d Without warning, an ear-piercing scream rang out back in the courtyard.The little girl, Song Yunjuan, was racing towards the exit with a ghost with disheveled hair right behind her.\u201cHELP!!!\u201d Song Yunjuan\u2019s face was sickly pale. A trifle unsteadily, she caught herself before she almost tripped as she ran. Tears and mucus streaked across her horror-filled face.\u201cIt\u2019s the little girl from the Manor!\u201d Li Shunxi paused in his steps with a face full of hesitation. He glanced at the ghost behind her. Compared to the distance between them and the little girl, the ghost was still far off. There was perfectly adequate room for them to save her before continuing their escape.\u201cYou guys go ahead first!\u201d He said, unable to bear leaving her in the lurch.Duan Meng\u2019an and Ning San glared at him.\u201cBoss is even further ahead of us. If they catch you, nobody\u2019s gonna come back for you!\u201d\u201cCut the crap! Just go while the formation is down!\u201d Li Shunxi set his mind on his decision. He simply did not have it in him to leave such a young little girl to die in this dangerous Manor.Duan Meng\u2019an and Ning San glanced at the little girl and began to hesitate too.\u201cHelp! Brother! Big Brother!!!\u201d As Song Yunjuan ran, she suddenly tripped over a piece of sharp stone and momentarily fell on the ground. The female ghost behind her pounced towards her.\u201cAHH!!!\u201dShe shut her eyes tight and screamed at the top of her lungs.\u201cBAM!\u201dThe deep sound of impact echoed across the courtyard. Lu Sheng rushed up from behind them and clutched onto the female ghost\u2019s head. His palm glowed crimson as he released scorching heat into it, causing it to sizzle with white smoke.With a flip of his hand, he sent it smashing into the distance behind him violently.Rescued from danger, Song Yunjuan looked at Lu Sheng with eyes full of gratitude.\u201cThank you, Big\u2026\u201d\u201cBOOM!!!\u201dWithout warning, Lu Sheng delivered a kick straight into her, launching her up in the air till she smashed onto one of the Manor\u2019s pillars. The collision sent her rebounding back into the air.\u201cSPLAT!!!\u201dA gleam from Lu Sheng\u2019s saber flashed across the air, slicing Song Yunjuan into two halves from the waist. Her pretty eyes were opened wide, as if she had hardly even had time to comprehend what had happened. Blood spilled across the ground.\u201cBoss\u2026 !!!\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an and Ning San stared in dumb shock.Li Shunxi was dumbfounded too. He had not expected this outcome in the slightest.Without paying attention to them in the slightest, Lu Sheng strode to the Manor door and hacked it into pieces with one saber strike.\u201cKa-cha!!!\u201dThe wooden door was smashed to pieces. Lu Sheng was the first to dash out. Only then did the trio including Li Shunxi behind him come to their senses and hurried out after him.Once out of the manor, however, the three of them looked dazedly at the scene before them.A densely packed company of men and horses, numbering in the hundreds, surrounded them outside the Manor.Lu Sheng sprinted to the front of the company, grabbing over an already lit torch in his hand.\u201cRAZE IT!\u201d He bellowed.\u201cRAZE!\u201d A Crimson Whale Sect leader yelled.Instantly, the company of sect disciples lit their arrows and pulled their bows, aiming right at Song Manor.\u201cSwish swish swish swish!!!\u201dDozens of fire arrows flew in an arc and landed in the Manor like meteors, setting the entire Manor on flames in the blink of an eye.The red flames rapidly grew stronger and more intense till they became a blaze.Lu Sheng climbed on a horse, staring coldly at the blazing Manor, his face impassive and his body unmoving.The flames raged on as everybody watched on.\u201cYoung Master, the firewood on all four sides was lit ablaze,\u201d a small leader licked his lips as he reported.\u201cContinue shooting the fire arrows!\u201d Lu Sheng ordered coldly.\u201cYes sir!\u201dSwiftly, the sect disciples pulled their bows again and lit the oil sachets on their arrowheads.\u201cSwish swish swish swish!!\u201dAnother volley of fire arrows flew out and landed viciously into the Manor.\u201cROAR!!!\u201dAbruptly, a petite figure emerged out of the blazing flames in the Manor\u2019s exit. It was the little girl Song Yunjuan!Flames raged all over her body as she roared savagely at the company of sect disciples outside.The roar did not sound human at all. It sounded more like the roar of some wild beast!In the fire, the little girl suddenly charged towards the exit\u2013only to slam into what seemed like an invisible wall, unable to come out.She shrieked and screamed at the company of men, her small face gradually melting like wax. Yet even then, her eyes and mouth remained three black gaping holes, roaring on.\u201cROAR!!!\u201d\u201cBOOM!!!\u201dA straight saber spinning at high speed smashed squarely into the little girl\u2019s face, ramming her back into the flames in the Manor.Lu Sheng put down his arm and yelled, \u201cKeep shooting! Down to the very last arrow!\u201dNear frightened to death by the earlier sight, the company of men had almost failed to maintain their formation. But Lu Sheng\u2019s yell jolted them out of their shock. They tightened the grip on their bows and fired off several more volleys of arrows into the Manor after some hesitation.Several more volleys of arrows later, the Manor was finally entirely consumed by flames.\u201cKA-CHA!\u201d Without warning, a charred figure dashed out of the Manor gates, falling to the ground and rolling over. The flames on his body were soon extinguished, but roars kept being emitting from his mouth.The sect disciples jumped in fright. Some among them pulled their bows, ready to fire a few arrows into this man.\u201cHold!\u201d Lu Sheng lifted his arm, stopping them.He stepped forward quickly and took a look. Faintly, he was able to recognize that the man on the ground was the scholar he had caught sight of when he had passed by the Manor back then.The burns all over his body had caused bloody blisters. His face was charred, yet his features remained shaped into what was unmistakably a smile. In fact, it was a grin.Seeing Lu Sheng approach, the scholar lay prone on the ground. Trembling, he scribbled a few words on the ground: I am human.\u201cBring him away for treatment. He\u2019s a man, not a ghost,\u201d Lu Sheng instructed.The orders had been given, but none among them dared to near him.Only after a long while did a few bold sect disciples come forward and lift the scholar up for a close scrutiny.\u201cHeavens! This man has had his tongue cut off! No wonder he can\u2019t speak,\u201d an old disciple swallowed and exclaimed.Lu Sheng recognized him as the scholar he had seen previously only because of his outfit.The key to why he was able to distinguish between ghosts and living people was mainly because of his extremely acute five senses. Each of the three inner force skills under Lu Sheng\u2019s mastery required several decades of diligent cultivation by ordinary cultivators. Combined together, they gave him an inner force of such density and depth it was equivalent to over a hundred years of hard work by an ordinary cultivator.Such inner force cultivation had amplified his five senses to a terrifying extent. Within ten meters, he could even hear the heartbeat and breathing of others clearly.This was also the key to how he was able to discover that Gong Ruqing and the rest were ghosts.In addition to this discovery, the footprints left before the main door comprised only the three of theirs and Li Shunxi\u2019s. Of the rest, not a single one could be found.Although it was in the darkness of night, Lu Sheng noticed this detail with his powerful vision.The facts combined gave birth to a speculation in his mind. Thereafter, he observed them closely and picked up a particular faint scent on Gong Ruqing that was exactly the same as that found on the little girl Song Yunjuan.He knew then that his guess was not far from the truth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The weapons they were carrying were temporarily taken away.Especially Li Shunxi had been billowing with rage when he witnessed the little girl being slashed in two under Lu Sheng\u2019s saber. He couldn\u2019t understand; Lu Sheng was really too cruel and heartless to have not spared even such a small little girl.Yet even before he could voice his protest, he was startled by the series of events that subsequently unfolded before him.That little girl\u2019s melting face in the big fire had scared him out of his wits. His initially furious countenance vanished without a trace, having been replaced by a terrified one, filled with fear.Only now, under watch of the sect members, did he truly see the careful deliberation behind Lu Sheng\u2019s plans.This dude had actually decided to set fire to the entire Song Manor right from the very beginning! Wasn\u2019t that obvious from the bow and arrows, as well as the combustibles, that had long since been prepared by the sect members here? [1]If he could deduce that, then Duan Meng\u2019an and Ning San could arrive at that conclusion as well. In that moment, all three of them felt a chill in their hearts. Before entering the Manor, there was no way Lu Sheng could have predicted whether there would be others who went in as well. Yet, even so, he had ordered to burn down the entire place. Evidently, he was extraordinarily decisive and ruthless, far from the average Joe.In his startled state, Li Shunxi stared straight into the raging flames that were devouring the manor, somewhat lost in his own thoughts.\u201cKA-CHA!\u201dA bright flash of lightning lit up the sky as the pitter-patter of rain began to fall.The fire was unrelenting as it continued to rage on, though it was somewhat diminished as the downpour washed over it.\u201cRetreat!\u201d Lu Sheng climbed onto a horse and turned around to rush for the mining village.The crowd of sect members followed behind closely, without another glance at Song Manor up in flames behind them.When they returned to the mining village, the rain grew in intensity and fell down in sheets. The people tidied up the interior of the house, and Lu Sheng changed into a set of fresh clothes and applied some medicinal powder to aid in his recovery. He waited till daylight before leading the sect members back to the Song Manor premises.The torrential downpour had ceased with the dawn of the new day.When the crowd returned to Song Manor, what greeted them were the remnant charred ruins of a dilapidated manor. The main doors had been burnt to two slabs of charcoal, half hanging from the door beams. White smoke continued to billow out from within the manor, as if there was a fire somewhere that had not yet gone out.The high walls surrounding the sides of the manor remained in their place, though the stone surface was covered thickly in black soot.The sect members, numbering more than a hundred, dispersed and surrounded the entire perimeter of the Song Manor. They stopped when they were about twenty meters away from it.Taking the lead with a saber in hand, Lu Sheng walked towards the main door. After resting through the night, he had almost fully recovered from his injuries. Now that he had rested sufficiently, he had the alertness of a dragon and the ferocity of a tiger; it was the best time to strike.Similarly, Li Shunxi had courageously volunteered himself to come along to assess the situation. Presently, he was hot on Lu Sheng\u2019s heels.\u201cBrother Lu, after that big fire, there should be nothing left in the manor. If I\u2019m not wrong, that little girl should be a Blood Corpse,\u201d he said in low tone.\u201cBlood Corpse?\u201d That was the first time Lu Sheng had encountered that term.With a hard kick, he pushed the doors open and strode in.\u201cA Blood Corpse is a ghost formed from the coagulation of poisonous, vengeful blood. It\u2019s not formed from a living person, but rather is a sort of supernatural being that generates itself into existence,\u201d Li Shunxi said solemnly. \u201cLast night, I chatted till dawn with the scholar who had escaped. I once learnt some lip reading back home, so we could communicate quite easily.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Lu Sheng glanced back at him; unexpectedly, this fella had quite a few tricks up his sleeves.It was the color of charred black all around the courtyard within the manor. The ground, the walls and the house had all been thoroughly burnt and remained piping hot until now. Smoke billowed out from all nooks and crannies; it wasn\u2019t even clear if it was smoke from the fire or steam caused by the evaporating rainwater.Just walking across the ground felt as if they were stepping onto a warm stove.Li Shunxi continued, \u201cPeople outside are all spreading that Song Yunjuan was that scholar\u2019s biological sister, and the Fifth Sister of this manor.However, after I inquired Song Yuncheng about it, I learned that he actually doesn\u2019t have any so-called Fifth Sister\u2013other than him and his Second Brother, he has no idea where the other three brother and sisters came from! What\u2019s even more terrifying is that he had only realized it after co-existing with those things for a few years!\u201dHearing that, Lu Sheng\u2019s heart grew cold. He fell silent for a moment before continuing.\u201cWhat do you mean? Don\u2019t tell me that other than Song Yunjuan, there are still two other monsters in this manor?!\u201d\u201cThat I\u2019m not sure of. However, ever since that scholar realized this frightening truth, Song Yunjuan, that monster, cut off his tongue and imprisoned him in his own house. What\u2019s strange is that, according to the scholar, Song Yunjuan went to school and back each day as per normal, and even ate and slept like any ordinary person. However, once she slept, she would suddenly rise from the bed and transform into a terrifying, monstrous killer. He had wanted on many occasions to stealthily kill her in the day, but was never able to pluck up courage.\u201dFrowning, Li Shunxi added, \u201cAccording to him, Song Yunjuan seemed to mutter to herself very often, talking to god-knows-who.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t he get himself into this trouble because of his obsession with pill concocting?\u201d Lu Sheng asked darkly.\u201cNot sure. I asked him the same question too. He said that he had unintentionally chanced upon a bird\u2019s nest in the middle of the forest once. In it, he discovered a pitch-black medicinal pill, which he decided to bring home to check if it was someone else\u2019s concoction. Little did he expect that the medicinal pill would mysteriously disappear, and from then on, strange occurrences began to happen in the house,\u201d Li Shunxi answered gravely.\u201cPOP. \u201dAbruptly, Lu Sheng stopped in his tracks as he seemed to step onto something.Looking down, he could see a long lock of hair, black as ink.Bending over, Lu Sheng used the tip of his saber to lift it up and take a careful look.His face suddenly distorted.\u201cRUN!!!\u201dSpinning around, Lu Sheng made a beeline for the main doors. He grabbed onto Li Shunxi and flung him violently towards the exit. He himself flew out like an arrow at lightning speed.Just as the two of them stepped past the main doors, a bang echoed out from behind them.Turning around to look at the Manor that was burnt beyond recognition, they saw that the pair of charred doors had actually been forcefully shut tight. It was as if there was someone violently shutting it close from the inside.The momentum propelled Lu Sheng more than ten meters away before he gradually slowed to a stop. He gripped onto Li Shunxi, who cut a sorry figure. Malice clouded over his eyes as he craned his neck to look towards the manor.\u201cThere\u2019s still danger in this place!\u201d\u201cI get it\u2026 this is an Anomaly. It must be! My Master had once mentioned that only an Anomaly would be like this! A Blood Corpse that can\u2019t even be destroyed in a blazing fire\u2026\u201d Li Shunxi\u2019s expression was suddenly replaced with shock and fear.\u201cWhat anomaly!\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s voice was as if it could cut through glass.Swallowing his saliva, Li Shunxi stared fixedly at the tightly shut doors of the Song Manor.\u201cLet\u2019s leave this place first before talking!\u201d His face had turned somewhat pale.Collecting himself, Lu Sheng glanced at Song Manor. Presently, it was shrouded in sinister stillness. Compared to before, it was even more dilapidated and rundown, and even more dangerous.\u201cLet\u2019s go, retreat for the moment,\u201d he looked down at the tuft of woman\u2019s black hair that was still hanging from the tip of his blade. Despite the huge fire, it had not been destroyed.***At a branch base of Crimson Whale Sect.In a small patch of woods outside Mountain-Edge City, there was a bamboo tower, standing silently among the bamboo grove. Verdant green of the bamboo leaves crowded around the tower, rustling in the wind from time to time.In a quiet room on the third floor of the bamboo tower were numerous guards from the Sect, who kept watch as Lu Sheng and Li Shunxi sat facing each other. Before them were various wines and dishes that were displayed on a bamboo table. [2]Lifting his head, Li Shunxi surveyed his surroundings; there was emerald green as far as his eyes could see. The sight caused one\u2019s heart to be freed of its troubles and be reinvigorated.\u201cBrother Lu indeed has fine taste.\u201d\u201cBrother Li hails from an extraordinary background; what\u2019s this little scene to you?\u201d Lu Sheng replied casually. \u201cLet\u2019s continue from where we last ended\u2013what\u2019s that so-called Anomaly? Will Brother Li please advise?\u201d He didn\u2019t harbor any ill feelings towards this Li Shunxi other than having the impression that he was a goody two-shoes. This person had a strong sense of justice, but lacked experience and was easily fooled by what he saw before him. Other than that, he was a rather decent chap.Upon hearing the term, Li Shunxi\u2019s expression distorted.\u201cAnomaly\u2026\u201dLifting up his wine-cup, he gulped down a few mouthfuls of green wine.\u201cIf ghosts can be considered the result of a form of mutation, then Anomalies are extraordinary sceneries that are absolutely impossible to destroy.\u201d\u201cSceneries?\u201d Lu Sheng was startled. \u201cYou mean, naturally occurring phenomenon like rainbows and earthquakes?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 not just that. I heard from my Master that the most special trait about anomalies is that they exist forever. The Song Manor, for example. I\u2019m certain that if we were to go back there, we\u2019d still be able to see that little girl Song Yunjuan, as well as those Souls of the Dead,\u201d Li Shunxi explained in low tones.\u201cHow did Brother Li come to know all these?\u201d Lu Sheng was solemn as he asked.Li Shunxi also grew solemn.After a long while, he poured himself yet another cup of wine and downed it in a gulp. \u201cMy Master\u2026 he died in an encounter with the anomalies.\u201dShocked, Lu Sheng didn\u2019t say anything else. He hadn\u2019t imagined that Li Shunxi would actually have such a deep connection to such things.Li Shunxi smiled a little, his expression somewhat sinister.\u201cI came out to gain some experience, all to continue to upgrade myself. One day, I will avenge my Master!\u201cFrom the looks of it, Brother Li comes from quite a distinguished background, isn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t you have a way around it now?\u201d Lu Sheng asked seriously.Li Shunxi was startled when he heard that. He smiled bitterly. \u201cMy family is indeed of high standing. However, Anomalies are similar to the Noble Families\u2013they\u2019re simply not something that we ordinary mortals can hold up against.\u201d\u201cYou know of the Noble Families too?\u201d A slight sparkle shone in Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes.\u201cYes. All officials, after achieving a certain rank, would know of this,\u201d Li Shunxi said lightly. \u201cThe present Emperor\u2019s lineage\u2013the Huang Family that wields power in the entire realm\u2013is most likely one of the Noble Families.\u201d\u2018So it was true. \u2018Lu Sheng\u2019s heart sank. Indeed, it was as he had guessed; the present-day royal family of the Song Dynasty was actually a member of the Noble Families.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s not talk about this, it\u2019s too far removed from us. The Noble Families are of incredible status and extremely mysterious; they belong in a different world than we,\u201d Li Shunxi said bitterly.\u201cThere would likely be encounters with Anomalies in other places as well, right? How then have those been settled?\u201d Lu Sheng enquired.\u201cCordon them off as forbidden zones, and take a detour,\u201d Li Shunxi replied.\u201cCordon them off as forbidden zones?\u201d Lu Sheng was speechless. Didn\u2019t that mean that there was no way to deal with them?\u201cYes. All Anomalies are limited to an area and have boundaries. As long as we don\u2019t go inside to mess around, it should be fine,\u201d Li Shunxi nodded. \u201cSpeaking of which, I\u2019m rather interested in how Brother Lu was able to hurt the Souls of the Dead.\u201d\u201cIs that very rare?\u201d Lu Sheng was alarmed.\u201cYes, rare enough,\u201d Li Shunxi looked at Lu Sheng strangely. \u201cAlthough there are numerous inner force skills of Yang attribute that, when trained to high levels, can hurt ghosts, those are after all low-level ghosts. Moreover, it\u2019s already quite impressive if the ghost is destroyed after more than tens of strikes.Souls of the Dead are considered deadly even among ghosts, and yet with Brother Lu had them all beaten into black pulp within less than ten moves. This is the first time I have seen something like this.\u201dLu Sheng, likewise, was rather curious.\u2018Perhaps the Yang attribute of my inner force skill is exceptionally powerful?\u2019\u201cMay I be so bold to ask Brother Lu what\u2019s the name of the inner force you train?\u201d Li Shunxi asked out of curiosity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Kurisu\u201cIt\u2019s an incomplete skill called Black Fury Skill,\u201d Lu Sheng did not attempt to conceal it. After all, it was a skill that he had acquired from an auction. Though it might have been mysterious to the average person, it shouldn\u2019t be considered any sort of secret to those in the know.Indeed, upon hearing the name of this skill, Li Shunxi\u2019s brows scrunched up.\u201cIsn\u2019t Black Fury Skill a body tempering skill? I\u2019ve heard that it indeed has fire poison effects. But just that fire poison itself should merely be enough to burn boils out of a person\u2019s skin. How much inner force would it take to have power like Brother Lu\u2013enough to slay a Soul of the Dead?\u201dAs the words left his mouth, Lu Sheng instantly recalled the difference between himself and other inner force experts.Hesitant, he asked softly, \u201cMay I know how many strikes Brother Li can execute at full strength?\u201d\u201cAt full strength? One strike of course, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Li Shunxi cast Lu Sheng a weird look. \u201cMustering inner force from the entire body and putting it all into one strike\u2026 of course that would consume the entire body\u2019s inner force. Any strike after that will have to wait till Qi recovers. Isn\u2019t that basic common sense?\u201dLu Sheng was stunned.\u201cThen how long does it take for your Qi to recover, Brother Li?\u201d\u201cProbably about an hour of meditation. Why? Isn\u2019t it like that for everyone?\u201d Li Shunxi replied casually.It dawned on Lu Sheng how different he was from others.Ever since he achieved full-mastery of several inner force skills at the same time, inner force had flowed ceaselessly within him, cycling without end. Even at full strength, he could strike over ten times continuously before needing to recover Qi. And he even had Yin Yang Attraction to replenish inner Qi too.As a result, the depth and thickness of his inner Qi was several times that of other experts in the same level.Moreover, after Black Fury Skill had evolved into Blood Fury Skill, his inner Qi became even denser, by more than a fold.As a result, his strikes were accompanied by a sweeping force that was unimaginable by the average cultivator\u2019s standards.\u201cI\u2019d like to ask a question,\u201d Lu Sheng ventured after his realization. \u201cIf one was powerful enough to resist an Anomaly\u2019s assault, is there a chance that one can thoroughly eliminate it?\u201dLi Shunxi stared at him with a peculiar expression, dumbfounded.By the time he slowly replied, Lu Sheng was even getting slightly impatient.\u201cAnomalies cannot die. No matter how many times you kill it, it will easily reappear again. Perhaps Noble Families have methods to deal with them, but not us.Besides, as time passes, Anomalies will grow stronger and stronger. We should count ourselves lucky to have met a recently formed Anomaly. If we were trapped in those Anomalies that have been formed decades, even centuries ago, we probably wouldn\u2019t be sitting here talking now.\u201dA recollection seemed to come upon Li Shunxi all of a sudden. His face turned dark and ugly once again.Lu Sheng guessed that he had recalled the Anomaly his master had encountered previously and so fell into silence as well.The two of them sat in silence for a moment before Lu Sheng spoke again. \u201cBrother Li, do you mind explaining about all the supernatural beings that you\u2019ve encountered before for me? So that I can understand the danger involved.\u201dHe had just saved Li Shunxi\u2019s skin. Naturally, Li Shunxi readily agreed to such a small request.He chuckled, \u201cEarlier, I misunderstood Brother Lu. So of course, this is not a problem.\u201dImmediately, he explained more than ten different types of ghosts he had encountered to Lu Sheng in detail. According to him, he had not seen the same type of ghost twice. Ghosts came in different shapes and forms; their abilities differed from each other as well.The demonic ghosts that Lu Sheng had seen, for instance, were something he had never heard of.After the exchange, both of them were rather satisfied with what they had learned.From Li Shunxi, Lu Sheng had obtained plenty of data on other ghosts. Li Shunxi, too, had some gaps in his understanding of ghosts filled by Lu Sheng. Furthermore, he was very glad to be of help to Lu Sheng in a small repayment of Lu Sheng\u2019s grace.The two of them sat till dusk before returning to Mountain-Edge City together.Li Shunxi bade Lu Sheng farewell and left his apartment. Lu Sheng gave instructions to all the men under him to start building a path towards the iron mine that bypassed Song Manor.After several days\u2019 effort, a new route was established from scratch. Lu Sheng guaranteed that they would be safe as long as they avoided Song Manor.As a result, work in the iron mine resumed. Massive numbers of miners were recruited and dispatched into the mine. Lu Sheng also posted his men to guard and supervise the mining work.Everything fell into order.After two days of mining operations continuing without any mishap, Lu Sheng headed to Crimson Whale Sect headquarters once again and presented a conclusive report on the present situation.He was still awaiting being granted full legitimacy in his position so that he could enter Martial Proclamation Library.***In Crimson Whale Sect headquarters.It was still the same titanic ship. But, many of the upper echelons of the sect were out on missions this time round.Only the Sect Master and two Deputy Sect Masters\u2013Gongsun Zhanglan and Chen Ying\u2013as well as two Internal Affairs Emissaries were present.Old Sect Master\u2019s face looked pale, as if he had gotten weaker again.\u201cSo does that mean that the supernatural being was behind the Song Manor incident?\u201d He coughed as he looked at Lu Sheng, seated beneath the podium.\u201cIndeed,\u201d Lu Sheng replied calmly. \u201cWhen I investigated further, I met the legendary indestructible Soul of the Dead. After exchanging a few blows with it, I was just barely able to get out of the fight unscathed. This Song Manor has indeed turned into a haunted zone. Even a blazing fire couldn\u2019t raze it down.\u201dThe old Sect Master coughed again, then shut his eyes and remained quiet.Deputy Sect Master Chen Ying cleared his throat and was about to speak.\u201cIn other words, this matter\u2019s still left unresolved? Right?\u201d Abruptly, Gongsun Zhanglan asked.\u201cIf Deputy Sect Master Gongsun is confident, you may go try it yourself,\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s face was unflinching.\u201cJust answer my question: has this matter been resolved?\u201d Gongsun Zhanglan smiled, then asked gravely.Lu Sheng turned his gaze towards him and stared at him for a few seconds, before replying,\u201cIndeed, as Deputy Sect Master said, it\u2019s unresolved. However\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is no \u2018however\u2019. If it\u2019s done, then it\u2019s done. If it\u2019s not, then it\u2019s not,\u201d Gongsun Zhanglan smiled. \u201cSince it isn\u2019t, then Wu San\u2019s estate should not be inherited by you. Am I right?\u201dLu Sheng was speechless.Even Chen Ying had no idea how to speak up for him, except to simmer in rage.The old Sect Master fell into thought silently. The ambience in the hall turned heavy and tense.\u201cNews!!!\u201dSuddenly, a guard rushed into the hall, interrupting the tense silence. He knelt on one knee before the old Sect Master.\u201cSect Master, External Affairs Emissary Zhang has returned from Jie Long City!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s returned?! Quick, admit him!\u201d The old Sect Master\u2019s countenance lifted visibly as he rose and shouted.Lu Sheng had also heard about this External Affairs Emissary Zhang from those around him in the past few days. He was considered the strongest expert among the present External Affairs Emissaries.Before long, a muscular man, who was covered in blood all over and whose face looked drained of color, walked into the hall at a slow pace, a guard trailing behind him.\u201cGreetings to Sect Master, Deputy Sect Masters,\u201d he clasped his hands together. As he spoke, it was clear that he was suffering from over-exhaustion of blood and Qi. He looked no different from a weather-beaten old man.\u201cThankfully, I\u2019ve not failed in my mission. This time, we\u2019re finally clear about the movement patterns of that powerful ghost blocking our path.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been hard on you, External Affairs Emissary Zhang,\u201d the old Sect Master went over to support him.\u201cThis ghost is no joke. It\u2019s not something that the average man can touch. It\u2019s already no mean feat for External Affairs Emissary Zhang to be able to come out of it safely.\u201d\u201cSect Master\u2026!\u201d\u201cYou, on the other hand, External Affairs Emissary Lu, returned with no results to show. External Affairs Emissary Zhang came back with a body of wounds, blood-soaked robes, and a clear understanding of the ghost\u2019s movement patterns. How about you? What right or merit do you have to lay claim on the position of an External Affairs Emissary?\u201d Gongsun Zhanglan exclaimed.\u201cZhanglan, you talk too much crap! Brother Lu was able to go in and come out of Song Manor unscathed. That just goes to demonstrate his outstanding strength. Don\u2019t tell me that all our men have got to return with wounds for them to be considered brave?\u201d Chen Ying replied coldly, unable to hold his peace anymore.\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said,\u201d Gongsun Zhanglan smiled and looked at Lu Sheng. Had it not been for the sudden emergence of this brat, this position ought to have gone to his niece. It was a pity that because of this man, the opportunity that his niece had been longing for had once again passed her by.\u201cEnough. Although Brother Lu did not fully succeed in his case, the Manor is extremely dangerous. From today onwards, it shall be listed as a forbidden zone. Put up the signs, lest people enter it and come to be harmed,\u201d the old Sect Master commanded. \u201cThis case is closed. Brother Lu has proven his strength. So many of our men have witnessed the eccentricity and terror of that Manor. Brother Lu rightfully deserves the position of External Affairs Emissary.With that settled, let\u2019s discuss the situation in Jie Long City. White Sands Sect and Green Star Sect have struck an alliance. Establishing a route this time is not so easy. Moreover, there\u2019s that ghost intercepting along the route\u2026\u201dWith old Sect Master\u2019s word, the dust had settled on Lu Sheng\u2019s matter.More than a hundred sect disciples had personally witnessed Lu Sheng sending the girl-ghost flying backwards with a single strike of his saber. They had also seen how he led Duan Meng\u2019an and Ning San out unharmed.While those jealous of him may still be trying to find faults with him, most of the sect was convinced of his abilities.The topic presently shifted to the conflict between Crimson Whale Sect and the two other sects in the direction of the Central Plains\u2013White Sands Sect and Green Star Sect.Lu Sheng was clueless about this matter and so could only play the role of a listener.Although Crimson Whale Sect lorded over the Northern lands and had innumerable connections with the authorities, its influence had not extended to the factions in the Central Plains.Furthermore, the distance was considerable. Even someone from the top ranks like External Affairs Emissary Zhang was barely able to come back alive. That went to show how prickly the issue was.The meeting lasted all the way till noon before dispersing.Lu Sheng was asked to stay by the old Sect Master for a lunch together.After lunch, he took Lu Sheng on a stroll in the garden at the back of the headquarters. A large number of flora and fauna was kept on the deck in the rear of the massive Crimson Whale.The two strolled along in the garden leisurely. Through the foliage, the noon sun rays fell on the ground in blotches. The ground was damp and covered in a layer of soft lawn.The old Sect Master walked in front, hands behind his back, sighing without a turn of his head.\u201cBrother Lu. Do you know why Deputy Sect Master Gongsun is so against you?\u201dTrailing behind him, Lu Sheng nodded in reply, \u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors. Probably because his niece wanted my position. Neither of them expected that I\u2019d show up and take it all of a sudden.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re an honest one to speak your mind,\u201d the old Sect Master paused, turned his head and laughed.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to hide? I entered Crimson Whale Sect precisely to find stronger experts to learn through exchange. If Gongsun Zhanglan ever picks a fight with me, it\u2019d make my day,\u201d Lu Sheng said without a care.\u201cYou\u2019re different from the others indeed\u2026\u201d old Sect Master Hong Mingzi chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about Brother Lu\u2019s extraordinary strength from Elder Ouyang and the rest. But we\u2019re all members of the same sect after all, and we\u2019re bound to run into each other one way or another. There\u2019s no need to make things difficult.\u201d\u201cSince old Sect Master has spoken, if that Gongsun Zhanglan ever makes a move on me, I\u2019ll save him some face,\u201d Lu Sheng replied nonchalantly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0KurisuHe actually really was not afraid of Gongsun Zhanglan. Although he was likewise a Spirit Focus expert who cultivated both inner and outer forces, there were also differences in strength among experts of the same level.They may have been of the same realm, but he boasted three powerful inner forces, the equivalent of the average person\u2019s hundred years of cultivation. If others got wind of this, it would be terribly shocking and no one would have believed him in the least.There was no need to even mention other aspects of Lu Sheng\u2019s strength. Just competing in terms of inner force alone was enough to pull any opponent to his grave.Ever since he interacted with Li Shunxi, Lu Sheng had a deeper understanding of the power of his inner force skills cultivation.Although Black Fury Skill was strong, it wasn\u2019t as powerful as he had imagined. However, the modification enabled by his Modifier had bolstered the skill with tremendous energy, giving him profound inner strength that was equivalent to decades of hard work by others. Add to it the unbridled squandering of his inner strength and it was no wonder that Lu Sheng was capable of dealing so much damage.Moreover, he recalled that he had first successfully mastered Jade Crane Skill before beginning to cultivate Black Fury Skill. By then, he had accumulated an amount of inner Qi that would have taken ordinary men ten years to achieve. As a result, he had Jade Crane Skill serving as support whenever he executed Black Fury Skill.Armed with two formidable inner force skills, Lu Sheng had Jade Crane Skill providing Black Fury Skill with unparalleled power to restore Qi and an immense amount of inner strength. That was why the might of his strikes way surpassed ordinary levels to begin with.Therefore, he seemed completely formidable.If even drips of water could tunnel through stone over time, what more an inner force skill like Black Fury Skill?\u201cGongsun Zhanglan\u2019s Prime Mystic Palm is packed with power; Brother Lu, don\u2019t underestimate him,\u201d the old Sect Master was somewhat stumped; he had also begun to find Lu Sheng somewhat arrogant.\u201cNo problem. May I know what skill the old Sect Master cultivates? I have heard often that Sect Master\u2019s cultivation base is deeply profound. Your name resounds across the whole Northern lands, and you are reputed as the Number One Expert in the North. I wonder if you could offer me a few tips?\u201d Lu Sheng suggested earnestly.He genuinely wanted to see where he stood compared to this Number One Expert in the North, and who among them was the stronger. Up till now, he had always been exchanging blows with ghosts and the like, and most of the pugilistic experts could not compare at all to him. He had no way to discern clearly where his ability placed him.Therefore, he wanted to find out just which level in the pugilistic world he ranked at.The old Sect Master smiled a little.\u201cI won\u2019t presume to offer any tips. This old man has lived but a few years more than Brother Lu. As for my cultivation, it\u2019s just that little bit deeper.\u201dHe slowly turned around to face Lu Sheng.\u201cSince Brother Lu is obsessed with martial arts, then let us exchange just a few friendly tips, without hurting our relationship.\u201d\u201cMany thanks to Sect Master for obliging!\u201d Lu Sheng was resolute. Finally, he could clearly place where he stood in terms of his power.He and the old Sect Master stood firmly facing each other, many meters apart.\u201cThe so-called cultivation of both inner and outer forces refers to the union of external strength and internal essence. After Spirit Focus is the level of Divine Prime\u2013to be as boundless as the divine sky, its vastness integrated into one\u2019s body.\u201dThe old Sect Master Hong Mingzi smiled gently as he pointed his fingers forward like a sword, extending it straight towards Lu Sheng\u2019s chest, moving at times slowly and at times quickly.Lu Sheng could see his fingers very clearly. At the same time, however, something about their movement eluded and confused Lu Sheng\u2019s senses. His heart was pent up with frustration, and he felt the urge to vomit.\u201cTIGER ROAR!\u201d Lu Sheng stretched his palm flat like a saber, slashing straight ahead with explosive killing power.Thick inner Qi accompanied his explosive outer force, surging out and propelling the might of the palm strike, turning Lu Sheng\u2019s palm blood-red. The slash was followed closely by a faint gust of hot wind.\u2018What impressive inner force!\u2019Hong Mingzi\u2019s expression remained unchanged, but he was secretly thoroughly astonished. Likewise, he swiftly mustered his inner Qi. Initially, he activated only ten percent of his Ultimate Crimson Mantra inner force. But halfway through his move, he realized that he had underestimated the force contained within Lu Sheng\u2019s strike.Swiftly, Hong Mingzi activated fifty percent of his inner strength.With more than eighty years of laborious cultivation behind his inner strength, even fifty percent of it already resulted in an intensely vigorous and overwhelming force. His right hand channeled the four-fold tremor ability which was the unique trademark of Ultimate Crimson Mantra and pointed precisely at Lu Sheng\u2019s palm-saber.\u201cBAMMM!!!\u201dThe palm-saber and finger-sword collided, sounding remarkably like the impact of two heavy objects smashing against each other.Although he didn\u2019t show it, Hong Mingzi was so shocked that his heart lurched violently.\u2018Such robust inner strength that can even hold its own against fifty percent of my power??! Absolutely unbelievable!\u2019One had to understand his finger-sword\u2019s contact surface area was much smaller than that of Lu Sheng\u2019s palm-saber. Given equal inner force, he would have had the upper hand.Moreover, Ultimate Crimson Mantra was extremely powerful; it far surpassed the average mantras.Even then however\u2026\u201cBOOM BOOM BOOM!!!\u201dBoth of them continued to trade several blows. Lu Sheng fell back two steps, a flash of red coloring his face for a second before dissipating. From his opponent\u2019s finger-sword, he felt a mighty force that rivaled his own. Moreover, each thrust was followed closely by yet another.Caught off guard, he was hit several times in a row and had even suffered damage to his meridians.\u201cSect Master\u2019s inner force is as powerful as the legends have it! This junior is deeply impressed by your unabating might!\u201d Lu Sheng was genuinely shocked to his core this time.Among ordinary mortals, the old Sect Master was the very first person who could force him back in a fair and open fight. With his strength, he indisputably deserved his reputation as the Number One Sword Expert of the Northern Lands. Lu Sheng had fallen to a disadvantage even in a head-on fight against him.One had to understand that he had a cultivation that comprised of three major inner force skills. His gross total inner force volume exceeded that of the old Sect Master without a doubt. Although neither of them used any killing moves, the Sect Master had already demonstrated extraordinary power in being able to push back such a deep, given his age, cultivation.\u201cI\u2019ve gotten old, I\u2019ve gotten old\u2026\u201d Hong Mingzi stared at Lu Sheng with eyes of admiration and solemnness. Now he finally understood why Lu Sheng was so highly regarded by Elder Wang, to the extent that the latter had written to his Eldest Brother to come and take him in as disciple.\u2018Nine-Strokes Sword &amp; Palm Wang Yuanshan\u2026 hehehe,\u2019 Hong Mingzi had not seen him for a number of years. Rumor has it that he had made quite a name for himself in the Central Plains. Back then, they had been evenly matched. But now\u2026 he wondered.\u201cBrother Lu,\u201d a thought came to Hong Mingzi\u2019s mind. \u201cYour inner force is incredibly thick and your cultivation base extraordinarily deep. If I\u2019m not wrong, you must\u2019ve had met with some strange encounter when you were young and obtained some rare object that resulted in the growth of your inner force?\u201dStunned, Lu Sheng quickly nodded, \u201cSect Master has discerned correctly. When I was young, I once ate a scarlet-red fruit. Ever since then, my inner Qi has climbed steadily each day with cultivation,\u201d he had been deliberating over how to conceal the true reason for the unnatural growth of his inner force. Little did he expect the old Sect Master to ask at this moment and so he quickly spun a cover story.\u201cAh, I see. As I expected indeed,\u201d Hong Mingzi exclaimed. \u201cThat is an incredible destiny! It\u2019s just that despite the depth of your inner force, rivaling even that of this old man, your inner force mantra seriously puts you at a disadvantage\u2026\u201d\u201cMy mantra puts me at a disadvantage?\u201d Lu Sheng stared at old Sect Master\u2019s fingers. Not a single trace of burn wounds remained from the earlier battle. He was unscathed from Blood Fury Skill\u2019s fire poison and incendiary effects.\u201cNo need to look any longer. Your mantra should be a fire poison Yang-attribute inner force that has evolved from a poison skill. But this sort of inner skill places too much emphasis on poison and is lacking in other effects.As for why this old man isn\u2019t affected by fire poison\u2013it\u2019s because my Ultimate Crimson Mantra is also a Yang-attribute inner force. It has a total of seven levels, and this old man has cultivated it to the sixth level. My inner force is as hot as the heat waves in a furnace, impermeable to all fire poison.The strange thing is\u2026 there seems to be some element that mediates and balances the Yin and Yang in your inner skill. It doesn\u2019t look like an inner force mantra purely based on Yang attribute and fire poison,\u201d old Sect Master paused and looked at Lu Sheng with a peculiar expression.Lu Sheng was filled with awe. This was indeed the Number One Expert of the Northern Lands! With his depth of experience and insight, he detected Lu Sheng\u2019s other inner skills nearly at one glance.\u201cTruth be told, Sect Master, the inner skill that this junior cultivates is a skill acquired from an auction\u2013Black Fury Skill.\u201d\u201cBlack Fury Skill?\u201d The old Sect Master was surprised. \u201cThat body tempering inner force skill that supposedly has thirty-two levels?\u201d\u201cOld Sect Master, you\u2019ve heard of this skill?\u201d Lu Sheng hoped to get some information on Black Fury Skill from this old Sect Master. The manual on this skill was too badly damaged; if he could find a complete volume and train all way till Level Thirty-Two, then its power would be unimaginable.He was only at the fourth level right now, and already had such robust inner strength. It was almost unfathomable how mighty Level Thirty-Two would be.Hong Mingzi\u2019s brows tightened into a knot.\u201cAlthough they say that there are thirty-two levels in this Black Fury Skill, the mantra itself is basically theoretical. Apparently, even the creator of the skill had only trained to the sixth level. The rest of the levels are but his theoretical extrapolations.\u201d\u201cWhy did the creator himself only train to Level Six?\u201d Lu Sheng asked, curious.\u201cBecause when he reached the sixth level, fire poison attacked his heart and his inner force burnt him alive,\u201d Hong Mingzi said plainly.In that moment, Lu Sheng\u2019s heart sank.\u2018It seems like this Black Fury Skill is just the product of an arm-chair theoretician? Just like the Grand Diversion of Heaven &amp; Earth in Jin Yong\u2019s wuxia novel? The subsequent levels are all theory?\u2019\u201cTherefore, I advise that you switch to another skill to cultivate as your main skill; it\u2019s for your own good. I suspect that the person who released the mantra was up to no good, and probably had intended to make others his lab-rats,\u201d the old Sect Master said solemnly.\u201cDo you know why the rest of Black Fury Skill is so badly damaged? Actually, it\u2019s not that it\u2019s damaged, but that it was deliberately discarded because it cannot possibly be cultivated. That\u2019s why only five levels are being circulated on the market nowadays,\u201d he explained.\u201cThen haven\u2019t I wasted my time on this inner force skill for nothing?\u201d Lu Sheng was stunned.\u201cNot necessarily. It will be very easy to change from cultivating Black Fury Skill to a similar Yang inner skill. That\u2019s if it doesn\u2019t clash with the meridians, of course,\u201d the old Sect Master stroked his mustache as he smilingly added.\u201cOld Sect Master, you mean\u2026?\u201d Lu Sheng was somewhat stirred.\u201cThe inner force skill mantras that you seek can be found within Martial Proclamation Library. Other than the Ultimate Crimson Mantra, you can choose from three other skills of Yang-attribute. You can try them out. Of course, only the first level is available for free. If you want to access other, higher levels, then you\u2019ll need to have sufficient contributions to the Sect,\u201d Hong Mingzi smiled. \u201cHowever, with your extraordinary innate talent, Brother Lu is a dragon among men. Adopting such a method wastes far too much time. This old man has a way to circumvent sect rules and impart you with an exceptionally strong Yang inner force skill directly.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Lu Sheng was no fool. Naturally, he could deduce the meaning of Sect Master\u2019s painfully obvious hints. \u201cMay I be so bold to ask what Sect Master means\u2026?\u201dHong Mingzi laughed heartily.\u201cThis old man\u2019s Master, Mo Fei, was a hero of his generation in the pugilistic world. His Ultimate Crimson Mantra boasts impressive power that is optimally suited to Brother Lu, considering you\u2019re looking to switch to a skill of similar nature. It surpasses Black Fury Skill by leaps and bounds! If Brother Lu is willing, this old man is willing to accept you as my Junior Brother on behalf of my Master!\u201d\u201cJunior Brother?!\u201d Lu Sheng had actually thought that Sect Master intended to accept him as a disciple. Little did he expect that he was actually taking in a disciple on behalf of his Master!Actually, Hong Mingzi himself had indeed considered accepting Lu Sheng as his disciple. However, after exchanging blows with him, he sensed that their cultivation bases were not that far apart. He then realized that, given his abilities, it\u2019d be a stretch for him to be Lu Sheng\u2019s Master after all.However, looking at this rare, fine gem of a man, he was worried that Lu Sheng would leave Crimson Whale Sect to seek other martial arts in the future.If Lu Sheng could join Crimson Whale Sect to learn martial arts, then once he encountered even stronger skills, there\u2019s no guarantee that he won\u2019t leave for greener pastures.Therefore, after deliberating back and forth, he came up with this tactic.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0KurisuLu Sheng took just a short while to figure out the old Sect Master\u2019s intentions.\u201cAnd where is the Sect Master\u2019s esteemed Master now?\u201d He was somewhat moved. An expert that was the Sect Master\u2019s master was surely of a realm even higher than Spirit Focus. It wasn\u2019t a bad thing for him to be his Master.\u201cMy Master has already left this world for more than ten years,\u201d the old Sect Master replied somberly.Lu Sheng was speechless. It seems like the Sect Master was trying really hard to tie him to the same boat as Crimson Whale Sect.One must understand that in this world, once he formally entered the tutelage of a Master, his reputation would go down the drain if he ever rebelled one day in the future. This was akin to repaying kindness with enmity, or to do wrong by one\u2019s benefactor\u2013something frowned upon by all.Therefore, the moment he joined the school of the Crimson Whale Sect Master, there would be no room for him to switch allegiance in the future.\u201cSect Master, please allow me some time to consider this,\u201d unable to make up his mind on the spot, Lu Sheng could only delay the matter momentarily.\u201cWhat\u2019s there more to consider? It\u2019s not like this old man is asking you to be a slave,\u201d shaking his head, the old Sect Master said laughingly. \u201cMoreover, my Master\u2019s school isn\u2019t of the same league as Crimson Whale Sect. You\u2019ll fully find out about it if you enter my Master\u2019s school\u2013there\u2019s plenty you\u2019ll gain from it.\u201dLu Sheng hesitated a little, but after giving the matter careful thought, he made his decision. Although he might encounter even stronger martial arts skills in the future, right now was the period of his exponential growth. The present him was still too weak and insignificant, armed with merely a few skills to barely defend himself. If he were to meet the really powerful supernatural beings, then he would really be in the soup.\u201cIn that case, junior apprentice brother pays respects to Senior Apprentice Brother!\u201dOnce Lu Sheng\u2019s mind was made up, he knelt and went on all fours to kowtow to the old Sect Master.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you wont regret your decision,\u201d the old Sect Master laughed heartily. \u201cCome, come, follow me.\u201dNow that their relation was confirmed, Hong Mingzi was overjoyed. He brought Lu Sheng out of the little garden and descended two flights of stairs into the Crimson Whale ship, entering a concealed area that resembled an ancestral hall.Within the ancestral hall hung rows and rows of paintings, which were portraits of all sorts of old people, men and women alike.The old Sect Master pointed at a portrait that hung smack in the middle and said softly,\u201cThis is the previous Sect Chief of our Crimson Sun Sect and your Master, Hand of the Scorching Sun\u2013Mo Fei. Come, pay your respects before the portrait.\u201dLu Sheng didn\u2019t mind. Since he had joined the other party\u2019s sect, then he naturally should perform the necessary ceremonies to pay respect.He knelt on the praying mat in front of Mo Fei\u2019s portrait and kowtowed nine times. This was the Nine Kowtow Grand Ceremony; once he entered his Master\u2019s tutelage, it was like forming a father and son relationship that would last a for lifetime. It wasn\u2019t just for fun.Be it the Master or the disciple, one was bound by obligations and responsibilities. If the Master did not put in effort to teach the disciple, his reputation would be utterly tarnished. His name would be trampled upon and others would curse him vehemently.And if the disciple were to dishonor the Master, he would similarly be the object of utmost ridicule if word were to ever get out about it.He bowed, offered tea and joss-sticks, burnt some notes and recited the Sect\u2019s rules.After performing the whole set of rituals, Lu Sheng developed a rough understanding of this Crimson Sun Sect.This Crimson Sun Sect was both a righteous and an evil sect. Moreover, its members have always been few. Recruitment was both difficult and mysterious; even in its most prosperous times, there were no more than four members in the sect. Crimson Wale Sect was but an extension of its power that was subordinate to the Crimson Sun Sect.After finishing the entire trip, dusk had fallen.Lu Sheng accompanied the old Sect Master onto the deck for a stroll to clear his mind. The deck of the Crimson Whale ship was enormous, with a copious number of buildings and courtyards on the higher floors. At one glance, it looked like an entire city district.Under the protection of many guards, the two of them strolled along the ship\u2019s railings, enjoying the breeze from the river.\u201cJunior Apprentice Brother\u2026 from now on, we are family. I\u2019ve also added your name onto the Sect\u2019s register, and relayed the news to a few Sects we\u2019re on good terms with. From today onwards, you are also considered part of the core personnel of Crimson Whale. It\u2019s time for you to know some matters,\u201d coughing a little, Hong Mingzi said in hushed tones.\u201cIs it regarding the Noble Families?\u201d Lu Sheng asked plainly.\u201cSo you\u2019ve heard,\u201d Hong Mingzi nodded. \u201cThe Noble Families are way above us; it\u2019s a position that\u2019s been innately determined, so we don\u2019t have another choice about it. We can only adapt and get used to it, because only they are able to oppose Devils and Aberrations.However, the Noble Families almost never poke their noses into worldly matters. Normally, they only send us a piece of information or an order every decade or so. You don\u2019t need to bother about them if there\u2019s nothing of concern.Your senior apprentice brother here just wants you to have some background. This world is fraught with dangers\u2013other than Demonic Ghosts, there are Devils and Anomalies. Naturally, we are not alone in this fight.\u201dLu Sheng frowned but said nothing. He thought back to Duanmu Wan\u2019s attitude from before. That feeling like she viewed everyone else as hapless and powerless tiny ants kept replaying itself in Lu Sheng\u2019s mind.\u201cNo need to mull over it. Noblemen number few and far between. What\u2019s more, they are spread out over the entire Song nation, making their numbers even smaller. We would be really lucky if we could meet one every decade or so,\u201d Hong Mingzi smiled.\u201cThat rare?\u201d Lu Sheng was stunned. He had met with Duanmu Wan twice consecutively, and with Yan Kai later, thus he had assumed that the Noblemen were everywhere.\u201cVery rare,\u201d Hong Mingzi replied with a smile. \u201cJust take the Lord of our Northern lands, the Zhen Family, for example. In their entire direct bloodline, there are but over ten people. Moreover, most of them roam from place to place without settling down. Some even conceal their identities, enjoying the game of life. In the vast Northern lands with over hundreds of mighty cities and tens of millions of people, locating them is like trying to find a needle in a haystack.\u201dLu Sheng understood the situation better now.\u201cThe Noble Families are high and mighty, but their numbers are extremely small. That\u2019s why those truly in control are still the government and us sects,\u201d Hong Mingzi continued. \u201cTherefore, in reality, our Crimson Whale Sect is in charge of a large territory that includes Mountain-Edge City, Green Maple City, as well as a few other large cities and more than ten smaller cities\u2026 all these are under our charge. We have many people deployed and stationed in those cities who will send information and resources back regularly.In reality, because of the long distance between us, there are branches of the Sect in each of those cities which are smaller, independent Crimson Whale Sects. Most of the time, these sects are left to their own devices.\u201d\u201cSenior Apprentice Brother, you mean\u2026?\u201d Lu Sheng didn\u2019t know what Hong Mingzi was trying to convey by telling him all these.\u201cAfter saying so much, what I mean is that your senior apprentice brother\u2019s health is deteriorating and not like before. In many matters, I\u2019ll probably need Junior Apprentice Brother\u2019s ready assistance to help,\u201d Hong Mingzi reached into his chest to retrieve an intricate metallic-gray piece of cloth, which he passed to Lu Sheng.\u201cThis is the entire Ultimate Crimson Mantra, complete with Levels One to Seven. You\u2019ll need to take the Crimson Yang Pill to cultivate it together. Its power is unrivaled. Junior Apprentice Brother, you must take good care of this and make sure it doesn\u2019t fall into the hands of an outsider,\u201d Hong Mingzi instructed in all seriousness.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes shone and hastily received the cloth. Gently, he opened it up a little. His eyes were instantly greeted by the tiny words packed tightly into that top corner.\u201cBut Senior Apprentice Brother, why is it that our Crimson Sun Sect members have always been so few? Isn\u2019t it better to openly recruit members?\u201d Lu Sheng suddenly asked.\u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re unwilling, but that the inner force mantra is really too precious. Once, there was an internal rebellion that almost led to the loss of the mantra to outsiders.Moreover, our Ultimate Crimson Mantra requires the accompaniment of the specially concocted Crimson Yang Pill to cultivate. Otherwise, it\u2019ll lead to an excessive flourishing of Yang fire, which would hurt one\u2019s longevity and maim the body. As for the production of the Crimson Yang Pill, it\u2019s very expensive\u2026\u201d by now, Hong Mingzi had already expressed his meaning as clear as day.The vital aspect of the whole issue was the Crimson Yang Pill, which was too expensive to concoct. It would be hard to sustain if there were more members.Lu Sheng understood that instantly. He looked on as Hong Mingzi once again retrieved from his chest a small, crimson vial that he handed to Lu Sheng.\u201cInside this are Crimson Yang Pills sufficient to last you for a month. Junior Apprentice Brother, use them as you please. Come, let senior apprentice brother teach you the first level of Ultimate Crimson Mantra to initiate you into it,\u201d coughing again, Hong Mingzi gently suggested.\u201cSorry to trouble you, Senior Apprentice Brother,\u201d Lu Sheng cupped his fists in reply.\u201cAs long as you bring glory to our Crimson Sun Sect in the days ahead. The rival sects near us are mainly White Sands Sect, Green Star Sect and Plum Blossom Sect. The former two have been wrestling with us for control over the trade market in Jie Long City, while Plum Blossom Sect has some conflict with us over medicinal herbs. There\u2019s been many disputes over several vital medicinal valleys and forests between us. Although our Crimson Whale Sect is the Number One Sect in the North, the other sects are also not to be trifled with,\u201d Hong Mingzi explained. \u201cAs External Affairs Emissary, I\u2019m afraid Junior Apprentice Brother will have to handle all sorts of different trouble very soon. The Mountain-Edge City that you\u2019re in charge of is definitely not some benevolent ground.\u201dLu Sheng understood.Upon leaving the Crimson Whale ship, Lu Sheng felt somewhat surprised at the turn of events. Unexpectedly, it took so little effort for him to lay his hands on the Ultimate Crimson Mantra inner force skill which was even more formidable than Black Fury Skill.Even though the skill came with the condition of him being a Crimson Sun Sect disciple, with his senior apprentice brother being the present-day Chief of the Sect, he didn\u2019t mind all these too much. None of these really affected him.If he really had to accumulate contributions to the sect slowly and wait before he could exchange them for inner force skills comparable to Ultimate Crimson Mantra, god knows how long that would have taken him.Besides, there was no way that inner force skills of the same caliber as Ultimate Crimson Mantra would even be displayed in the Martial Proclamation Library.The sky was already dark by the time he alighted in the harbor. Lu Sheng flipped himself up on a horse. Following closely behind him were Duan Meng\u2019an, Ning San, and a few other sect members who were all intending to head back to Mountain-Edge City.\u201cExternal Affairs Emissary Lu, you seem so full of mettle. The matter is unresolved, and yet you\u2019ve reaped quite a lot of benefits from it, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Just then, a menacing female voice drifted from the side of the harbor.Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze lifted as he looked over. A few burly, strapping men were escorting a weak and gentle-looking woman with a long and narrow face. They were making their way over.This woman was dressed in red. Although she clearly had the perfect oval face shape, as both her cheeks were deeply sunk in, it gave others the impression that she was sickly and had shady and hostile intentions. Therefore, even though she had a curvaceous figure, she provoked no lust or desire in anyone.\u201cWho are you? Why are you blocking my way?\u201d Lu Sheng frowned.\u201cI\u2019m Gongsun Jing,\u201d the lady in red-robes answered coldly. \u201cI\u2019ve heard much of External Emissary Lu\u2019s esteemed name from my uncle.\u201d\u201cGongsun Jing? Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s niece?\u201d Lu Sheng asked casually.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d came Gongsun Jing\u2019s cold reply.\u201cAnd what\u2019s the meaning of you appearing before me right now?\u201d Lu Sheng looked at her with a queer expression, \u201cHas your uncle agreed to duel with me at last?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Gongsun Jing was startled, as if she hadn\u2019t understood what that was supposed to mean.\u201cIsn\u2019t that so? Your uncle purposely sent you over for me to give you a beating. Then, he\u2019ll finally have an excuse to officially duel with me. Isn\u2019t that what always happens in novels?\u201d Lu Sheng looked even more quizzical as he added.\u201cYOU!!!\u201d Gongsun Jing was riled up. Pointing at Lu Sheng, she was just about to berate him.\u201cSeems that isn\u2019t the case\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng was rather disappointed. He began to flex his fists, \u201cThen\u2026I\u2019ll kill you first, then wait for your uncle to come to me to avenge your death!!!\u201dBOOOM!In a split second, he stepped with one foot onto the wooden plank on the ground. The thick and sturdy plank was crushed into bits in an ear-splitting boom.Lu Sheng abruptly erupted, his physique resembling that of a ferocious tiger. Loud, thunderous tiger roars suddenly sounded out in the air.\u201cHOWL!!!\u201d\u201cBAM!!!\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s palm traveled more than the distance of ten steps to land squarely on Gongsun Jing\u2019s chest.\u201cPU!\u201dGongsun Jing\u2019s head was thrown back as a mouthful of dark blood spewed out from her mouth. Her body was flung backwards, crashing into the burly men behind her. Only after sliding more than ten meters backwards on the ground did she finally come to a slow stop.Her miserable shriek hadn\u2019t even left her mouth before she was strewn onto the floor, gasping for her last breath. She lay there on the ground, blood flowing out from her mouth profusely.Lu Sheng remained standing where he was, staring at the two burly men by Gongsun Jing\u2019s side. Presently, these few men were scared out of their wits. Lowering their heads, they quickly scampered to the side.\u201cThat old man Gongsun Zhanglan keeps avoiding me. Now, let\u2019s see what excuses he can spin to get out of a fight with me!\u201dAfter a fit of hysterical laughter, Lu Sheng led Duan Meng\u2019an, Ning San and the rest up their horses and left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His blood boiled as he looked on at his niece whose body was scorching hot as she lay there, fighting for her last breath.\u201cA BUNCH OF TRASH!!!\u201dHe glared at the subordinates by the side, their heads bowed and not daring to make a single sound.\u201cYoung Miss asked you to bring her there, and so you did?! She also asked you to go and die, so why haven\u2019t you done so yet?!\u201d\u201cSect Master\u2026! It was Young Miss who wanted to go see exactly what kind of character the person who snatched away her position was, and she wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. She gave us no other choice but to go\u2026\u201d an elderly man with a head full of white hair explained helplessly.Gongsun Zhanglan was also aware what kind of temper his niece had. She had paltry skills, and was always looking to beat the competition with her smarts. With such an inflated sense of ego, it was really very challenging for the average person to deal with her.He also knew that it was useless to vent his anger on these subordinates now. Gongsun Jing was the one who had initiated the confrontation, and Lu Sheng could very well argue that she had shown disrespect to someone of a higher rank.\u201cFire poison inner force\u2026!\u201d It only took a bit of investigation before Gongsun Zhanglan was able to discern what sort of injury the palm strike inflicted on his niece was.He brought Gongsun Jing into the inner room, where he gently removed his niece\u2019s clothing around her chest. Even when covered by her intimate inner garments, he could still see a reddish-black shape of a palm imprinted onto the space between her breasts. That was the last straw that caused him to blow his top.\u201cSuch a vicious palm strike! This could have sent Jing\u2019er to the grave!\u201dIf she did not have a corresponding cool, Yin-nature inner force to counteract the effects, then this palm strike might really have claimed his niece\u2019s life. Although the strike itself was not particularly brutal, the fire poison within was exceptionally ruthless; it burnt away at Gongsun Jing\u2019s life force unceasingly with every second.\u201cThis palm strike\u2026\u201dGongsun Zhanglan\u2019s face was white as a sheet of paper. He lightly touched the edge of the palm-print, which instantly caused his index finger to feel a burning hot sensation.\u201cLU SHENG!\u201d His eyes flashed with coldness. If the Sect rules hadn\u2019t prohibited the internal killing of another sect member, then perhaps Jing\u2019er wouldn\u2019t even have been able to return breathing.\u201cJing\u2019er!\u201d Suddenly, a petite and gentle woman pulled apart the blinds at the door and walked in. Seeing the miserable scene before her, she stood by the side sobbing as tears rolled down her cheeks uncontrollably.\u201cWhat are you crying for!?\u201d Gongsun Zhanglan coldly rebuked. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it! I\u2019ll make that Lu Sheng PAY!\u201dHe stood.\u201cGo, send someone to invite my sworn brother Fang Zhidong to come and save her. Then, issue a challenge to duel to that External Affairs Emissary Lu. Doesn\u2019t he want to duel with me? I\u2019ll gladly oblige!\u201d\u201cBut Big Bro!\u201d That woman was shocked and rather worried.\u201cNo buts. We can try settling this according to Sect rules, but it was Jing\u2019er who stood in that brat\u2019s way first. She\u2019ll be deemed the one in the fault for disrespecting someone of a higher rank. At the very most, his fault would be fixed as having delivered too harsh a blow and he would be reprimanded and made to reflect for a few days, and fined some money. Given Hong Mingzi\u2019s shrewdness, there would definitely be no goddamn consequence. It\u2019ll be utterly meaningless.If we want to act, then we need to be ruthless and issue a challenge for a death match,\u201d Gongsun Zhanglan finally made up his mind. In reality, Lu Sheng was but a blade belonging to the old Sect Master; if he wanted to continue to plant his own people, then he would need to first remove this blade.\u201cAlright. Big Bro, do take extra care. This person\u2019s palm strike is indeed formidable. It\u2019s a pity for our Little Jing\u2026\u201d the woman began to wipe away at her tears again as she spoke.\u201cIf my reputation wasn\u2019t at stake, then I wouldn\u2019t even give two hoots about Hong Mingzi. What more some Lu Sheng?\u201d News of the exchange between Lu Sheng and Hong Mingzi in the little garden had already reached his ears through his informants. He had a rough idea of Lu Sheng\u2019s prowess; although powerful, he was still quite a distance behind himself.\u2018This person\u2019s talent is extraordinary, progressing at an alarmingly fast pace; he is also younger than I am. He needs to be rid of as soon as possible,\u2019 Gongsun Zhanglan wasn\u2019t the type to dilly-dally. On the spot, he made arrangements for his sister to go to the study to pen down the challenge. This time round, he wanted to thoroughly incapacitate Lu Sheng and extinguish Hong Mingzi\u2019s hope.\u2018I\u2019ve been laying my pieces in Crimson Whale Sect for so many years. You think this little punk is enough to turn the tables? What a joke!\u2019 A murderous glint shone deep in Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s eyes.***At the Golden Jade Greenhouse in Mountain-Edge City.Among the properties under Crimson Whale Sect was a large patch of greenhouses on the outskirts of the city. It was especially reserved for growing plants for the rich and famous.It was vast and bright inside the greenhouse. In one of the largest greenhouses, there was a huge patch of empty ground that was exclusively for the purpose of sunning flower petals to produce dried flowers.Ever since Lu Sheng found out about this particular property a few days back, he had taken a liking to this place. The fragrance of flowers permeated the air and reinvigorated one\u2019s senses; the air was so much fresher here than in the city.Other than the subordinates keeping guard at the doors, everyone else, including the gardeners, had been chased out by him.Strolling slowly among the sea of red and yellow flowers, Lu Sheng retrieved from his chest that small clay vial. He removed from within a single red pill about the size of a grain and gulped it down.\u2018The Crimson Yang Pill is indeed legendary,\u2019 Lu Sheng could very obviously sense that the tiny pill had dissolved the moment it entered his mouth. Very swiftly, it agitated his oral cavity to secrete copious amounts of saliva that evolved into a scorching heat wave that descended along his throat, directly into his stomach.Very soon, he could feel an immense, warm sensation that emanated out from his stomach and his abdomen. His entire body felt warm and fuzzy.\u2018There is a total of seven levels in Ultimate Crimson Mantra. With senior apprentice brother\u2019s guidance, it was very easy to sense Qi and become initiated in it. After nursing my body for these last couple of days, I can perhaps try to break through into the first level today.\u2019Nowadays, it was very difficult for him to find a quiet place to secretly modify his martial arts skills. At the place where he stayed with Little Qiao, he could always feel that there was someone spying on him. Moreover, because he had such a heightened sense of awareness now, the presence of the large number of people who passed by on the street below easily distracted him and made it difficult for him to concentrate.That\u2019s why, after having taken over Wu San\u2019s entire assets, he had searched high and low for a suitably quiet place. Finally, he had found among his properties this patch of greenhouses.A part of these greenhouses produced fresh flowers to be sold in large quantities to the wealthy customers and officials who used them to decorate their backyards. Another part of these was used to produce dried flowers to be made into medicine and sold to the traditional Chinese medicinal stores in the city. Another portion was used to make the fashionable flower teas that were in huge demand in Crimson Whale Sect for their beautifying properties. It made for quite a prosperous business.Walking onto the patch of empty ground strewn with flowers, Lu Sheng stood still. Eyes closed and hands behind his back, he seemed to be taking in the faint fragrance of the flowers.Nobody would have guessed that he was making a breakthrough now.\u2018Deep Blue,\u2019 he called out silently.\u201cSwish.\u201dThe square frame of the Modifier appeared before him. At the top, a long row of martial arts options could be clearly seen.Lu Sheng scanned it from top to bottom and soon found among them what he was looking for\u2013Ultimate Crimson Mantra.\u2018Ultimate Crimson Mantra: Initiated. Special Effect(s): Level One Tremor Force.\u2019\u2018There\u2019s a special effect even at the Initiated Level? Extraordinary indeed!\u2019 Lu Sheng was inwardly rather pleased. He focused his spirit and calmed his Qi to regulate himself both physically and emotionally. He waited until his entire body had completely relaxed before he slowly pressed onto the button in the Modifier with his mind.\u201cSwish.\u201dThe entire Modifier flashed violently and entered into the \u2018modifiable\u2019 state.\u2018Upgrade Ultimate Crimson Mantra to Level One.\u2019Lu Sheng had long since learned the entire first level of Ultimate Crimson Mantra by heart. Presently, what he worried the most about in regards to the modification was still whether his body would be able to bear it.With a \u2018CHI\u2019, the selection for Ultimate Crimson Mantra on the Modifier quickly grew blurry. Very soon, it became clear again.\u2018Ultimate Crimson Mantra: Level One. Special Effects: Level One Tremor Force.\u2019\u2018Success!\u2019 Lu Sheng was overjoyed. At the same time, he could feel his body undergoing changes. More than half of the Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill reserves had been depleted to leave behind a pathetic scrap. Both Yin and Yang energies within him were also wiped out in a split second; who knew how long he would need for it to be replenished.The strangest was Blood Fury Skill; its inner Qi was actually constantly converting into Ultimate Crimson inner Qi for the Ultimate Crimson Mantra. Although the rate of conversion was extremely slow, it provided an impressively endless source of Qi.\u2018No matter what, Blood Fury Skill is not as intact as Ultimate Crimson Mantra, and it even has some unknown side effects. Now, since they are all Yang-nature inner force, it\u2019s a good thing that it has been converted. Saves me the trouble of having to worry about any problems in the future.\u2019Not only was Lu Sheng not flustered, he was very determined.In the middle of the greenhouse, brilliantly red and yellow flowers and plants were packed tightly. The air was very pure.Lu Sheng stood in the middle, his eyes closed and breathing regular. He carefully investigated whether his body had been spent in any other ways.\u2018The body is still deficient in Yin. Previously, Blood Fury Skill and a few other body tempering skills were neutralized and brought into balance by Yin-Yang Attraction. Now, however, this equilibrium has been toppled. Ultimate Crimson Heart is so much stronger than Blood Fury Skill, and also much more tyrannical in its strength. Naturally, the previous equilibrium wouldn\u2019t hold,\u2019 Lu Sheng made sense of it all. Slowly, he retrieved a black jewelry case from his sleeves.He flipped open in a \u2018plop\u2019. Sitting within was a curly lock of black hair.\u2018Just about time to give it a try. The importance of Yin-Yang Attraction to me goes without saying. If I\u2019m unable balance my body, then there will inevitably be many negative side effects and impact on my temperament. Moreover, when I upgrade skills in the future, I\u2019ll need even more robust inner life-force skills.\u2019Lu Sheng had made up his mind way earlier. This time round, he would use the hair he got from Song Manor to extrapolate his life-force skills.Biting lightly on his index finger, he dripped a drop of blood onto the hair.\u201cSzzzzzz!\u201dWhite steam-like mist began to pour out vigorously from the hair, immediately absorbed by Lu Sheng\u2019s finger the moment it came out.In that instant, he could feel a cold sensation flooding into him from his finger, travelling along his palm into his forearm, arm, and chest, then violently gushing into the small of his diaphragm. [1]\u2018Such powerful Yin Qi!\u2019 Lu Sheng was shocked.Yet in that split second, all the Yin Qi vanished in the blink of an eye, as if there was something that wiped it clean. Not a trace of it was left.\u2018Begin martial arts extrapolation?\u2019A dialogue box abruptly surfaced before Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes.\u2018Yes!\u2019Lu Sheng swiftly confirmed. Calming himself, he focused on Yin-Yang Attraction.\u2018Extrapolate Yin-Yang Attraction to Level Four,\u2019 he commanded. Yin-Yang Attraction itself only had two levels. However, after his previous extrapolation, it had arrived at Level Three. This time, it was going to be extrapolated to Level Four.The Modifier frame trembled vigorously and began to grow blurry.After more than ten seconds, the entire frame once again grew clear.\u2018Unknown skill: Level Four. Special Effect(s): Accelerated Qi Replenishment. Yin-Yang Equilibrium. Accelerated Recuperation.\u2019Lu Sheng felt out the new skill in detail. This skill took the previous circulation route of Yin-Yang Attraction as the foundation, and at the same time absorbed a large proportion of Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill\u2019s meridians. Presently, this new inner force was rapidly absorbing all of Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill\u2019s inner strength to transform into its new inner Qi. As for the overall quantity of the inner Qi, it was slightly less than those of Yin-Yang Attraction and Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill combined, but its quality was a lot purer.If the sensation that Lu Sheng got from the previous two skills was akin to that of two soothing, gentle threads that coursed within him, then this present new skill\u2019s inner strength was like a stream of icy cold jadeite in the fluid form that circulated unhurriedly inside him.\u2018This new skill is an altered version of Yin-Yang Attraction that has absorbed and fused Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng really hadn\u2019t expected something like this.He looked at the martial arts skills on the Modifier again.Indeed, the selection for Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill had vanished without a trace. Clearly, it had been wholly consumed by the new skill.In less than an hour, all the inner Qi that belonged to Black Tiger Jade Crane Skill had been entirely converted into the new skill\u2019s inner Qi. The entire volume of inner Qi surged incessantly within him, vigorous beyond compare.\u2018Since it has integrated the unique traits of both of these skills, then this new skill shall be named Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill,\u201d Lu Sheng wasted no time in naming it.The new Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill had already far surpassed the earlier lowly life-force skill, Jade Crane Skill. Instead, it had upgraded to an incredibly advanced life-force skill that Lu Sheng had never imagined it could become.After the new inner force tapped into the unique strengths of different skills and completed its evolution, Lu Sheng could clearly discern a difference in the current state of his body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Kurisu\u2018This\u2026 is needle-prick Qi?\u2019Lu Sheng walked beside a flowering tree and gently pressed his palm onto its trunk. Instantly, a large quantity of pinholes surfaced in its bark, packed densely together.\u2018Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill is actually a needle-prick Qi force?!\u2019 He was somewhat shocked.This inner force was, from the beginning, an inner force mantra that circulated wholly within him. This was just as he had expected. Yet now, it had turned into an inner force that could directly impact external objects, just like the stuff of legends in wuxia novels. How long had it merely been?\u2018No, that\u2019s not right; I may have such a result, but others may not necessarily be able to do so as well. This strike of mine\u2026 without decades of hard work, others simply have no way of achieving something like that. Most likely, because my inner Qi is far too robust, its essence has radically mutated and thus resulted in such a unique effect,\u201d Lu Sheng quickly formed an understanding regarding this matter.Withdrawing his hand, he stretched out his palm for a closer look. There was nothing out of the ordinary about his palm, unlike the Blood Fury Skill that resulted in dark-red, blood-colored palms. This Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill was much more powerful in concealing itself.\u2018If I were to suddenly and simultaneously strike with Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill when I activate Blood Fury Skill\u2026\u2019Lu Sheng\u2019s heart stirred. Blood Fury Skill in his left hand and Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill in his right, he struck out both palms in the same moment.\u201cCHI!\u201dAn ear-splitting screech abruptly erupted within the greenhouse.The tree that stood in front of Lu Sheng, thick as a bowl, was jointly struck on both its left and right. With a loud \u2018KA-CHA\u2019, it split into smithereens. The upper half of the branches collapsed to the ground with a thud; it was thoroughly charred in where it broke off, with pinhole injuries tightly packed together that resembled a beehive.Without hesitating for even a second, Lu Sheng spun around and ferociously attacked the ground with both palms.\u201cBOOOOM!\u201dIn a loud \u2018KA-CHA\u2019, two dissimilar palm-prints could be seen on the stone tiles on the floor.He straightened himself and looked down at them.The right Blood Fury Skill palm-print was as deep as a finger and charred through.The left Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill palm-print was more than two fingers\u2019 length deep. Numerous small holes bore into the ground, forming a palm with jagged edges.\u2018With equal exertion on both sides, the killing power of Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill far surpasses that of Blood Fury Skill,\u2019 Lu Sheng instantly understood.\u2018Can this still be considered a life-force skill?\u2019 He was somewhat stumped. \u2018However, Blood Fury Skill is now being converted by Ultimate Crimson Mantra. When the conversion is complete, the power of Ultimate Crimson Qi should be significantly greater and it should be able to catch up. But for now, Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill has become my number one trump card.\u2019Lu Sheng hadn\u2019t expected that, after undergoing integration, Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill would have that much power. It was almost twice the might of Blood Fury Skill. When he used it on an unsuspecting opponent, it could alter the course of the battle in a split-second.He shut his eyes and regulated his breathing for a while more in the greenhouse before making his way out unhurriedly. He walked to a little house by the side to rest and eat.The small house was a grayish-brown single-story building that was constructed from a special type of black mud, pressed and dried into bricks. This was the usual place where the gardeners and guards came to have their meals. Now that Lu Sheng was here, it was specially marked off for him.The meal was something that Lu Sheng had arranged for someone from a branch of the Sect in the city to deliver: stewed beef with potatoes, mushrooms braised with chicken, cold noodle rolls and a tub of aged mountain ginseng soup boiled with tiger\u2019s bones.The dishes were all nourishing, quality ingredients enjoyed only by someone of Lu Sheng\u2019s rank. An ordinary family couldn\u2019t afford meat like beef and chicken.\u201cThis treatment is indeed different from the young masters of ordinarily wealthy families,\u201d looking at the delicacies before him, Lu Sheng was somewhat moved.\u201cPrecisely. Young Master, you may not be aware of this, but each year, there are many of our own Crimson Whale Sect people who specially rear cowherds, and others who personally hunt in the woods for aged mountain ginseng and tiger bones. All these can be exchanged for contribution points to the Sect. Although this bit of contributions doesn\u2019t amount to much to the ordinary sect members, when accumulated together, they can exchange for better martial arts skill manuals,\u201d Ning San, who had been standing to the side, said respectfully.Ever since the Song Manor incident, Lu Sheng had kept him by his side. It wasn\u2019t for any special reason other than the fact that this Ning San had slept with a large group of ghosts and yet was able to escape unscathed; this had piqued Lu Sheng\u2019s curiosity.Moreover, this person had a rather tenacious character, a good understanding of etiquette, a sense of propriety, and a clear grasp of the ways of the world. Gradually, Lu Sheng had gotten used to having him stick around.\u201cThe taste is not bad, though it could be spicier,\u201d Lu Sheng tucked into the cold noodle rolls with his chopsticks. The vinegar within gave it a sour taste, which made him frown.\u201cI\u2019ll inform the main chef later,\u201d Ning San said without delay.\u201cMm,\u201d Lu Sheng nodded. He lifted the wooden tub of soup, as big as one\u2019s head, and began to gulp it down in big mouthfuls.In one breath, he finished a third of the tiger bone soup. Sweeping across the inside with his chopsticks, he fished out the bones and ginseng from within and chewed on them with relish. The bones had already been stewed to tender perfection. Fused with the delicious soup and the faint sweetness of the ginseng, it was thoroughly enjoyable.Lu Sheng devoured the meal rapidly and was halfway through it when the sound of a horse running at full pelt could suddenly be heard from outside.\u201cYoung Master! Bad news! BAD NEWS!!!\u201d His body drenched in perspiration, Duan Meng\u2019an hurriedly scrambled into the house, a look of terror on his face.\u201cWhat happened? Sit down and speak,\u201d Lu Sheng spoke neither hurriedly nor slowly. Lifting the rice tub, he scooped a huge mouthful of rice into his mouth and swallowed after chewing a few times. Then, taking his sweet time, he raised his head and looked at Duan Meng\u2019an.This thickly set man was presently ashen-faced and drowned in perspiration. In his hands was a white piece of paper that resembled some invitation.\u201cYoung Master! Terrible news! The Deputy Sect Master Gongsun Zhanglan has personally issued you a challenge to duel! And it\u2019s a deathmatch!!!\u201d Anxiously, he presented the note in his hands before Lu Sheng.\u201cA deathmatch?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s brows arched. \u201cSeems like his niece is on the brink of death; only now does this old turtle finally decide to show his hands, huh.\u201dAlthough he wasn\u2019t sure of Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s ability, but how could he be even stronger than the old Sect Master? Even if he were comparable to the latter, with Lu Sheng\u2019s fierce and robust inner Qi, need he fear that he wouldn\u2019t be able to drag the other to his grave?\u201cYoung Master! That\u2019s the Deputy Sect Master Gongsun Zhanglan we\u2019re talking about! When he was younger, he had single-handedly shaken up the entire Wan Feng Mountain Stronghold, and consecutively slain thirteen wanted murderers. He\u2019s an extraordinarily formidable foe whose power is able to terrify over a thousand bandits into dispersing!\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an had his tail between his legs. Although he was born with a hulky physique, he was utterly cowardly. This was totally unlike Ning San who, while not physically imposing, was exceptionally tenacious.\u201cSo what? The rumors are exaggerated out of proportion. Moreover, our Young Master is not one to be afraid of such matters. When he had beaten up that Gongsun Jing earlier, had he not already predicted that something like this would happen?\u201d Although Ning San was also frightened, causing his heart to thump wildly in his chest, he presently put on a calm front and replied impassively. He had bet all his stakes on Lu Sheng.Unlike the dim-witted Duan Meng\u2019an, Ning San had long since seen through Lu Sheng and knew that he had deliberately injured Gongsun Jing and attempted to provoke Gongsun Zhanglan into a direct confrontation with him. Since Young Master Lu Sheng had initiated the provocation, then he likely had the confidence to win. If Ning San wanted to rise meteorically in the Sect and become External Affairs Emissary Lu\u2019s right-hand man, then he couldn\u2019t let this opportunity slip him by.\u201cSince that old foggy has shown his hand, then I accept this challenge to duel,\u201d picking it up, Lu Sheng lightly flipped it open to read the one sentence that was written within:Three days later at the Long Rift Gorge, before sunrise; a death match. \u2013 Gongsun Zhanglan.\u201cInteresting. Where\u2019s Long Rift Gorge?\u201d Lu Sheng asked causally.\u201cIn response to Young Master, legend has it that deep in the eastern mountains, there\u2019s a gorge overrun with black tigers,\u201d Ning San replied.\u201cDo you know the way?\u201d Lu Sheng asked.As soon as the words left his mouth, Ning San was stupefied and in that moment, countless thoughts raced through his mind. The meaning of Lu Sheng\u2019s words was crystal clear; if he knew the way, then very likely, he would have to accompany him on the journey. As for the risks that came along with it, it was inconceivable to those not in the know.If Lu Sheng lost, then his life would also be at the mercy of Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s rage.Overwhelmed with the flood of these thoughts, Ning San calmed himself down.\u201cYes!\u201dLu Sheng looked at him deeply. Smiling, he said, \u201cGreat, then you lead the way and we\u2019ll go in together.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t an officially sanctioned death match, but one that arose over some personal feud. Thus, neither side could overtly prepare for it.After his meal, Lu Sheng didn\u2019t return to Mountain-Edge City but instead made a beeline for the Crimson Whale ship. He headed straight for where the most important manuals were held\u2013Martial Proclamation Library.Martial Proclamation Library was located smack in the middle of the body of the Crimson Whale ship. Heavily guarded on all sides, it was an independent small tower that had been built into the interior of the ship\u2019s body.The small tower stood silently on the ship, its exterior painted in pitch black. On each of its four sides stood thickly set outer force experts, on high alert and ready to defend the area.Lu Sheng retrieved his command medallion and passed through many inspection checkpoints, soon arriving at the first floor of Martial Proclamation Library.The first floor housed the most basic martial arts skills of all kinds. Most of them were ordinary techniques that were even more commonplace than Chasing the Wind Blade and Bear-Wrestling Arm. Not a single trace of inner force skills and the like could be seen. As for Crimson Whale Saber Technique, it was free.Here, Lu Sheng could even see some of the skills that he had learnt in the past, such as Precious Eight Steps. He had modified this skill to its pinnacle and thus it was unrecognizable compared to its humble beginnings. Yet nonetheless, it was but a third-grade martial arts skill that was of a very low value.After casually scanning through the entire place, Lu Sheng found that the martial arts skills on this first floor were all run-of-the-mill skills that couldn\u2019t even achieve Strength Proficiency. Moreover, many people came and went in this place, flipping through the materials.He decided he might as well not waste any more time and headed for the second floor.There were far fewer people to be seen on the second floor, with only about a handful of ten or so people. All of them were quietly perusing the manuals for the martial arts skills they were interested in.As for those martial arts skills that required contribution points in exchange, only a name and short description were available. The actual book itself was not displayed on the shelves.Lu Sheng scanned row after row of shelves and soon found where the hard body skill, Bear-Wrestling Arm, was located. Indeed, it was a free hard body skill.Nearby, there were also a few other hard body skills. However, only their names and short descriptions were to be seen.\u201cGolden Veil Skill, Soul Smashing Fist, Jewel Pillar Skill, Dusk Dantian Inflating Skill\u2026\u201dEach of the hard body skills was lined up against the other. The conditions required for cultivating each were also clearly detailed in fine print.Lu Sheng was also very interested in hard body skills. After all, they were effective for self-defense. If he could cultivate a few of them, then he wouldn\u2019t be so hard-pressed during crucial moments in battle.In that moment, however, he suddenly thought of a problem.\u2018I\u2019m learning more and more skills, making it more and more messy. I\u2019m also expending a tremendous amount of energy and physical Qi and spirit, but because my focus is too diffused, my actual battle upgrades are not as significant as I had imagined.Perhaps I should select one particular martial arts skill as the main skill for cultivation, and constantly extrapolate and upgrade it, propelling it to an unimaginable level. Otherwise, even if I cultivate more martial arts skills, I\u2019ll be a mere jack of all trades, but master of none.\u2019He fell into deep thought while standing in front of the bookshelf.A moment later, Lu Sheng gradually regained his senses.\u2018Ultimate Crimson Mantra is deep and profound, with as many as seven levels. That\u2019s sufficient for me to cultivate for a long time. I\u2019ll use this as my main skill. As for Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill, it\u2019s impressively powerful, and can even be reserved for use when upgrading martial arts skills. This can be my second main skill, or even my trump card that will come in handy in a moment of life and death.\u2019Having thought out the arrangements, Lu Sheng had a clearer idea now as he looked again at the skills before him.\u2018First, choose an even stronger hard body skill for self-defense. Together with Ultimate Crimson Mantra, it\u2019ll definitely produce a shockingly terrifying strike.\u2019His gaze scanned across the hard body skills displayed on the bookshelves. About ninety percent of these hard body skills required the aid of specially concocted medicinal tonics and pills. Without the requisite technical skill in that area, Lu Sheng dared not hand over the key to his own cultivation and life to an outsider. He had even inquired physicians regarding the ingredients of Ultimate Crimson Pill and fed one to a rabbit as a test.Therefore, he immediately eliminated all the hard body skills that required the consumption of medicinal herbs.There were only two shelves of hard body skills, totaling fifteen manuals. This was thus the entire accumulated collection that was in Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s possession, ranging from Strength Proficiency to Intent Proficiency, but none of the level of Spirit Focus and above.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

[1]Committing the name to memory, Lu Sheng walked directly to the overseeing counter on the second floor.\u201cI\u2019m External Affairs Emissary Lu Sheng. I want to withdraw the Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill for perusal,\u201d he passed his command medallion over to the white-haired elder behind the counter.The elder looked at him with narrowed eyes. A faintly discernible sense of inner force Qi could be detected on his body before it instantly vanished; he was actually also an expert.He held the command medallion in his hands and looked at it.\u201cNine Lakes Steel Chains Skill is a manual of the Strength Proficiency Realm. External Affairs Emissaries are only entitled to peruse one manual beneath the level of Spirit Focus for free each year\u2013you\u2019re sure that this will be it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201dLu Sheng replied unflinchingly.\u201cOkay,\u201d the elder turned to search around on the row of locked cupboards behind him before quickly locating a pale-blue-colored stitched manual from a mahogany drawer. \u201cKeep it well. Remember, don\u2019t leak it to outsiders, or Sect rules will be enforced.\u201d\u201cNaturally,\u201d Lu Sheng nodded. Receiving the small manual, he flipped through it to find tiny rows of words detailing the skill packed tightly on the page. However, it was clearly a copy of the original version. Among the Strength Proficiency manuals, some of them did not require an intent diagram. These skills without the requisite intent diagrams were also the type most easily spread; after all, just copying the words would suffice.Manual in hand, Lu Sheng left Martial Proclamation Court. He had used up his entitlement to freebies for the year, and any martial arts skills he\u2019d like to look into henceforth would have to be exchanged for Sect contribution points. Moreover, he had not resolved the Song Manor incident previously; thus, his contributions were still a dismal zero. It was really by the old Sect Master\u2019s grace that he still retained his position.\u2018Now, it\u2019s time for me to head back and restore my physical and emotional state. Hopefully, Blood Fury Skill\u2019s transformation to Ultimate Crimson Mantra can be completed before the duel,\u201d Lu Sheng left the Crimson Whale ship with the manual and hurriedly returned to his place in Mountain-Edge City to rest and quiet his mind.***Three days passed by in a flash.At the Long Rift Gorge deep in the eastern mountains.A strip of emerald green, like a ribbon, snaked through the Eastern Mountains into Long Rift Gorge, which was situated in the middle of the deep woods, then crashed down the gorge, forming a waterfall with foam as white as snow.The waterfall smashed down into the river in an arc, resulting in a veil of mist-like water vapor splashing up from it.On the semi-circle shore formed by the riverbank across the waterfall, Gongsun Zhanglan stood with his hands behind his back, dressed in green robes. Shallow water circled around his feet as he stared silently at the water vapor rising up from the waterfall.He had brought two people with him\u2013his sworn brother, Mountain-Edge hero Fang Zhidong, as well as his sister-in-law, Zhang Huishu, who was also Gongsun Jing\u2019s mother.The three of them stood silently on the beach, awaiting Lu Sheng\u2019s arrival to duel.To their sides, in a corner of the river, the old Sect Master Hong Mingzi and Elder Wang were presently sitting on a bamboo raft, looking onto the scene silently.They had secretly heard of Lu Sheng and Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s death match, and had quietly come forth to observe.\u201cJunior apprentice brother\u2019s strength is a mystery. Although this old man had tried to test him out with a few strokes, I could clearly feel that he held back.As for Zhanglan, the power of his Prime Mystic Palm is shockingly powerful. Whoever\u2019s at the mercy of that strike would die from immediate destruction of meridians, without exception. This palm strike is able to flow along the meridians to hurt the inner viscera. That\u2019s the result of fifty over years of tenacious cultivation. I fear it\u2019s not something easily handled,\u201d the old Sect Master Hong Mingzi said somberly.\u201cOld Sect Master, what\u2019s there to fear when you\u2019re here? When it comes to a head, you can step in to save brother Lu\u2019s life,\u201d Elder Wang didn\u2019t seem bothered in the least.\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. Chen Ying is away to settle some matters, and coincidentally, Zhanglan has chosen this time to challenge junior apprentice brother to a duel, and has also invited Fang Zhidong along. His purpose is to pin me down\u2013even for a short moment\u2013so that he\u2019d be able to do as he pleases,\u201d a hint of sorrow could be seen in the old Sect Master\u2019s eyes. \u201cPity\u2026 if only there was more time. With Chen Ying around, there\u2019d have been nothing to fear now.\u201d\u201cHuh? Sect Master isn\u2019t too optimistic about brother Lu\u2019s victory?\u201d Elder Wang asked, puzzled.\u201cJust somewhat worried,\u201d Hong Mingzi shook his head. \u201cIn my view, his power is also impressive, but still, he is just too young. Any hint of hesitation during the battle and he could be struck and injured.\u201dNow, Elder Wang was also beginning to worry.\u201cSadly, my Big Bro is still only on his way. Old Sect Master, you really moved too quickly. Brother Lu\u2019s skill is our family\u2019s heirloom Heart Shattering Palm. If he could become my Big Bro\u2019s disciple\u2026 er\u2026\u201d at this point, even he sensed the mismatch\u2013if Lu Sheng truly was an expert on par with Gongsun Zhanglan, then even his Big Bro would find it a stretch to be his Master.***The sun\u2019s rays shone mercilessly at noontime.Lu Sheng sat at the boat\u2019s bow, silently looking ahead onto the absolutely still, crystal clear surface of the river.He was dressed head to toe in scholar\u2019s white robes, which were reflecting light somewhat under the harsh sun. It was extremely striking.Ning San wasn\u2019t very sturdily built; a sack of black clothes was enough to cover himself up decently. Standing to Lu Sheng\u2019s side, he resembled a young student.Other than the two of them, a crowd of young masters and young ladies was also headed for Long Rift Gorge to admire the scenery.They sat at the back, chit-chatting merrily and incessantly like a pack of sparrows.This was a private boat headed in the same direction as Lu Sheng and Ning San, so the two of them had hitched a ride on it to save themselves the trouble of going all the way on foot. Therefore, no matter how noisy the rest of them on the boat was, it was the boat master\u2019s private business.\u201cBrother, there\u2019s an extraordinary air about you. Why do you always sit at the bow alone? Why not join us to admire the scenery?\u201d A somewhat tipsy handsome young master walked over shakily from the deck and asked brightly.He was the same man who had taken the initiative to invite Lu Sheng and Ning San on board when he had seen the duo asking about heading to Long Rift Gorge, Bian Su.\u201cThere\u2019s no need. I shouldn\u2019t interrupt your gathering with your buddies. It\u2019s good enough that we were able to hitch a ride,\u201d Lu Sheng smiled as he replied. They were originally supposed to have arranged one of the Sect\u2019s boats, but because the whole thing was done in secret, and also because he had only just remembered that they could travel by water, it was too late for them to source out another boat and they had no choice but to take Bian Su up on his offer.Although this Bian Su had an imposing personality, his figure was slender and his skin supple. With a glance, Lu Sheng could tell that \u2018he\u2019 was actually a \u2018she\u2019 in disguise.It seemed as if this boat of hers was for the sole purpose of going out on excursions. As for the others on the boat, Lu Sheng could immediately feel when he boarded that they had ill intentions, and often cast derisive looks in his direction. It was as if they hoped he wasn\u2019t on board.Because of his acute senses, he had been able to overhear the conversations between Bian Su and the rest throughout the journey. From what he overheard, he was roughly able to discern the situation that this young master Bian was in.This fellow was actually a young miss that had run away from home. As for the others on the boat, they were accompanying her on the excursion in name, but in reality, they were scheming and had other motives in mind. On a few occasions, Bian Su had wanted to send a message back home, but these people had manipulated her to change her mind one way or another. It seemed like they wanted to take advantage of her somehow.In short, this young miss who had run away from home had landed herself into some bad company who harbored ill intentions. And from what he could hear, the Bian family still had no idea of her whereabouts.After tactfully declining Bian Su, Lu Sheng watched as she shakily sauntered back to the deck of the boat. His eyes once again fell on the surface of the river.\u201cYoung Master, those people by young master Bian\u2019s side somehow seem unhappy about us hitching the ride,\u201d Ning San whispered at his side.\u201cI know,\u201d Lu Sheng answered casually.\u201cThen, Young Master, why do you\u2026?\u201d Ning San was speechless.\u201cWeren\u2019t we unable to find a boat at short notice?\u201d Lu Sheng answered somewhat absentmindedly.\u201cBut they don\u2019t even welcome us\u2026\u201d Ning San added helplessly.\u201cSo long as there\u2019s a boat for us. It\u2019s their business whether they welcome us, and our business whether we take the boat,\u201d Lu Sheng replied levelly.\u201cBut what if they don\u2019t let us board the boat?\u201d Ning San could not help but ask. Even though he knew that he shouldn\u2019t be so persistent to find out, he couldn\u2019t bear not knowing.\u201cThen we\u2019ll make them get off the boat,\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s few words spoke volumes.\u201c\u2026\u201d Ning San almost choked on his saliva. He was really stumped by his own Boss\u2019 line of reasoning. After being in Crimson Whale Sect for so long, he had never heard of anyone else as overbearing\u2013not even the legendary old Sect Master when he was younger.\u201cWe\u2019re men in a world of chaos, and should not bother with such trivialities. We\u2019re made for bigger things,\u201d Lu Sheng stretched out to pat Ning San on his shoulders; the latter didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or to cry at that.Of course, Lu Sheng was joking. By nature, he wasn\u2019t such an overbearing tyrant. It\u2019s just that he could tell that the boat master Bian Su had genuinely wanted to help them along their journey. As for the rest, they were not the \u2018boat master\u2019, and thus, he naturally didn\u2019t need to bother.The boat picked up speed and headed for Long Rift Gorge.Bird calls and monkey shrieks rang out from the thick forests on both shores every now and then. Once, a meter-long black bird even soared past the sky right above the ship, rousing cries and exclamations from the passengers on board.Bian Su was presently in the company of a few men and women. She was clearly getting drunk but was still exchanging cups with those around her.\u201cBA-THUMP.\u201dWithout warning, the ship lurched and shook. It seems to have ran into reefs.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWhat on earth is happening?\u201dA wave of curses and scolding erupted aboard the ship.The ship captain and its crew hurried out to explain; none of them knew what went wrong today, however. Usually there were no reefs in this area. Strangely enough, they seemed to have popped up overnight.Bian Su rubbed her throbbing temples and stood up. Feeling that she should drink no more, she refused a few cups offered to her and strolled to the ship\u2019s side to have some cool air.\u201cGrand Uncle, to which family do you think I should entrust that thing?\u201dShe seemed to be mumbling to herself; no one else stood around her.\u201cIt\u2019s all up to Young Miss. Now that Old Master\u2019s no longer around, this stuff is just a harbinger of calamities. It doesn\u2019t matter who we leave it with. As long as it stays in our hands, it\u2019s trouble,\u201d an ancient and raspy voice rang out beside her.Bian Su fell into silence. She could not bear to part with that object\u2013no matter whom she gave it to. After all, it was their family heirloom, passed down for so many generations. She understood, however, that she had no ability to keep it.\u201cI\u2019ve come here to the Northern Lands all the way from the Central Plains\u2026 yet they\u2019ve still tracked us down,\u201d she heaved a long sigh, the drunkenness on her vanishing into thin air in an instant.\u201cHey, what\u2019s the man hitching a ride on our ship doing?\u201d Suddenly, out of her peripheral vision, she caught sight of the baldy on the bow rising and walking to the tip of the bow. He seemed about to do something.\u201cHe\u2026\u201d Grand Uncle appeared beside Bian Su, staring at the bow, confused.\u201cBOOM!!!\u201dJust then, the entire ship trembled. From bow to stern, the ship shook and rocked violently, its whole body tipping forward as if a heavy object had just been smashed into its deck.Lu Sheng stepped hard on the deck with his right foot. An incredibly massive force pushed outwards behind him, with him at its epicenter. A wave of force seemed to ripple across the solid deck.Then, like a cannonball, his entire body launched into the air, shooting forward into the air towards the shore ahead. Excitement sparked in his eyes.On the shore, Gongsun Zhanglan drew his palms together, his hair and beard flying in the air around him. Faint pops rang out all over the muscles in his body as incredibly thick inner force gathered on his palms.Gazing at Lu Sheng who was shooting towards him, icy cold murderous intent sparkled in his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A series of booms reverberated across the entire valley like rolling thunder.\u201cHUMPH!\u201dForced into retreat, Gongsun Zhanglan humphed in furore. Raising the might of his Prime Mystic Palm to eighty percent, he channeled power into one palm and slammed it viciously towards Lu Sheng\u2019s temple.If this blow landed, Lu Sheng\u2019s head would be smashed into pulp there and then.\u201cUltimate Crimson!\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s palms were dyed crimson; arteries and veins bulged on his forearms. A streak of blood-red line rushed to the area between his eyes, forming a pattern on his forehead. He struck head-on against the incoming attack with his right palm, which shook in tremor.\u201cBOOM!\u201dAnother deep blast rang out. Both of them were pushed back more than ten steps.Only several breaths of time had passed from when Lu Sheng flew across the water to land onto the shore. Yet, both of them had exchanged more than ten moves, with neither one of them gaining the upper hand.\u201cNot bad, not bad, not bad! No wonder Hong Mingzi regards you so highly. This old one has underestimated you!\u201d Gongsun Zhanglan lifted up his right arm and glanced at his tattered sleeve. A slight green hue flashed across his face.Up till now, he could still feel a scorching sensation radiating from his palm. This was exactly what he had experienced when he had fought against Hong Mingzi a long time ago. He would be a fool if he still did not understand by now that Hong Mingzi had imparted Ultimate Crimson Mantra to Lu Sheng.Looking at his own sleeves that were also ripped into shreds, Lu Sheng grinned.\u201cSect Master Gongsun retains his strength despite his age; you were even able to block my sneak assault. And here I was thinking that I wouldn\u2019t be needing my saber,\u201d slowly, he reached behind him and pulled out a long saber from behind his back.Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s eyes narrowed to a slit. He realized that there was no way to avoid using his trump card in this battle. As he lifted the power of Prime Mystic Palm to its pinnacle, shades of green flashed incessantly on his face. This was the natural phenomenon that accompanied the power increase of his palm technique.\u201cROAR!\u201dAmidst a tiger\u2019s roar, Lu Sheng ripped off his top and pulled his saber completely out of its sheath. A cold saber gleam shot towards Gongsun Zhanglan.***\u201cThat\u2019s incredibly powerful\u2026\u201d on the ship, the man previously addressed as Grand Uncle stared in amazement at the two figures locked in combat on the shore. \u201cWith such moves, these are bound to be famed experts. Even in the Central Plains, they would be considered on par with some of the famed experts there!\u201dThe drunkenness had entirely disappeared from Bian Su, who was staring intently at the two men. Her eyes flashed with deep shock.\u201cGrand Uncle, if my dad was still alive, do you think he would be a match for these two?\u201dGrand Uncle fell into a momentary silence, then shook his head lightly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not. Old Master may have been strong, but he was still a cut below their realm.\u201dUpon hearing that, Bian Su no longer spoke any further. Her eyes flashed with the glint of pensiveness.By then, many of the young masters and young ladies on the ship had also discovered that something was going on. Gradually, they all came to the bow of the ship and saw the intense battle happening on the shore. Instantly, they burst into a fit of excited commotion.\u201cIsn\u2019t that Sect Master Gongsun!?\u201d One of them croaked abruptly. \u201cThe second-in-command of Crimson Whale Sect, Sect Master Gongsun Zhanglan?!\u201dAt those words, shock radiated across the rest who were on the ship. It was apparent to any among them who were acquainted with martial arts that these two men were fighting to kill, aiming for the jugular with every strike.\u201cWho\u2019s capable of engaging the Crimson Whale Sect Deputy Sect Master in a life-and-death battle?!\u201d Someone asked in alarm.Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s reputation was top-notch across all the Northern Lands. Anyone with some connections and power would have heard of the name of this Number One Sect in the Northern Lands.And yet its Deputy Sect Master Gongsun Zhanglan was locked in mortal combat here. Inevitably, this piqued their curiosity.\u201cSo it\u2019s the Crimson Something Sect\u2026\u201d Bian Su\u2019s eyes grew even deeper in thought as she overheard their discussion. \u201cGrand Uncle. About that object\u2026 what do you think if I\u2026\u201dBeside her, Grand Uncle\u2019s pupils shrank. Yet, he remained silent.\u201cSPLASH!\u201dWater splashed all over.As the commotion on the ship continued, Lu Sheng and Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s battle had come to a head. Given their more or less equivalent depth of inner force, the outcome of the battle depended largely on their moves, experience, and will to kill.In terms of moves, Lu Sheng was at a huge disadvantage. Plainly, he possessed extremely thick inner force; yet, it all came to naught if he could not land a blow on his enemy. Most of the time, he ended up getting hit by Gongsun Zhanglan on his flank or missing because Gongsun Zhanglan easily neutralized his attacks by either dodging or parrying them.Despite being an Intent Proficiency saber technique, Black Tiger Saber Technique\u2019s strokes were too simple after all; they were too easily figured out and too predictable.When all was said and done, it was but a third-class saber technique. It was already extremely powerful in Lu Sheng\u2019s hands and was adequate against ordinary experts. But when matched against the experienced and battle-savvy Gongsun Zhanglan, its inadequacies and loopholes were easily exposed. Had it not been for Lu Sheng\u2019s hard body skills which allowed him to dispense with defense and concentrate entirely on his offense, Lu Sheng would have long since lost the battle.Stroke by stroke, his long saber repeatedly meted out strikes from Black Tiger Saber Technique from different angles. Stroke by stroke, they were parried away.But Gongsun Zhanglan, on the other hand, was rather frustrated too. All his inner force was channeled into his Prime Mystic Palm. Yet, each time he wanted to draw near to land a strike, he would be forced backwards by Lu Sheng\u2019s reckless offensive and left with no option but to first block the advancing long saber.Lu Sheng was fighting with reckless abandon, but he himself still wanted to live on!\u201cDANG!\u201dIn a series of palm moves, Gongsun Zhanglan parried the saber blade slashing for his neck and burst forward.\u201cMystic Gate of Life and Death!\u201d The Prime Mystic Palm strike lashed out, seemingly heavy, but actually light-weighted.This strike was the culmination of Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s full-mastery over all his skills; it looked light-weighted and gentle on the surface, but could instantly explode with Prime Mystic Palm\u2019s pinnacle power in an instant if it were taken lightly by the opponent.With his saber slapped aside once again, anger rose in Lu Sheng\u2019s heart. He had not landed a single strike in more than ten moves. And now, seeing such a light and flippant palm strike coming his way, he was overjoyed that his opponent had finally decided to face him head on. Ultimate Crimson Mantra activated Ultimate Crimson Qi from all over his body in a frenzy, channeling them into his palm. Simultaneously, Lu Sheng activated Heart Shattering Palm to its peak and struck out madly.\u201cBOOM!\u201dBoth palms made contact. At first, Lu Sheng felt an emptiness behind his opponent\u2019s palm strike, as if his blow had landed on a ball of cotton. Then, a massive force came blasting towards him like a volcanic eruption. This gushing force was a stark contrast with the attack from before, smashing incredibly hard into the heart of his palm like a giant hammer.\u201cPrime Mystic: Extreme Emptiness!!!\u201d Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s eyes widened and his body shook. Decades of inner force gushed out and erupted out towards his opponent\u2019s palm. All his power lashed out from his palm.\u201cHAHAHAHAHA!!! Let\u2019s see who dies first!!!\u201d Lu Sheng had estimated the strength behind his opponent\u2019s palm strike wrongly. His own inner force had landed on emptiness. In contrast, his enemy\u2019s overwhelming force collided into his palm. Yet, despite his clear mistake, he began laughing madly. Ultimate Crimson Mantra was activated to the maximum as he resisted the invading force.\u201cYin Yang Jade Crane! DIE!!!\u201d He roared madly, released his long saber, and lashed out with another palm strike, hitting Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s flank savagely.Finally, he had used his trump card as well. Yin Yang Jade Crane Skill circulated all over him.\u201cBOOM!!!\u201dNow, each of them had suffered a strike, one after the other.Lu Sheng retreated several steps. A hue of red flashed across his face; he had clearly suffered internal injuries.Gongsun Zhanglan was forced sideways for more than ten steps. Blood seeped from the corner of his lips. His right arm hung limply by his side; it had clearly been fractured.\u201cIncredible palm might!\u201d He could not help but exclaim in praise, even though it was towards his enemy. Gongsun Zhanglan sighed as he touched his fractured right arm.\u201cWhat a pity\u2026\u201d\u201cSWISH!\u201dIn that instant, a black gleam shot out from his left arm. A black dart came flying towards Lu Sheng, a black chain trailing behind it.\u201cSoul Locking Spear!\u201d The old Sect Master, who had been watching the fight from afar, could not help but shout in alarm. \u201cHe\u2019s still been practicing this evil skill!\u201d\u201cConcatenate Soul Locking Spear\u2026 it\u2019s a top-grade evil skill that can be cultivated only by consuming human blood. Didn\u2019t Gongsun Zhanglan personally promise to cripple his cultivation of this skill!?\u201d Elder Wang too bellowed in shock and anger.\u201cNow that Soul Locking Spear has appeared, this battle must end! It\u2019s no longer a fair duel!\u201d Somber-faced, Hong Mingzi stepped forward, about to leap onto the shore.\u201cIs old Sect Master planning to interfere with this death match?\u201d On the shore facing the bamboo raft, Fang Zhidong stood composedly with his hands behind his back, staring at the pair including Hong Mingzi quietly. \u201cThat\u2019s not an action befitting of a senior. Whether it\u2019s orthodox or not, strength is the only thing that counts towards surviving in this world. Doesn\u2019t old Sect Master understand that yet?\u201dFang Zhidong was a very charismatic and handsome man. His almond-shaped eyes, goatee, and slim figure made him look more like one of the brush-wielding Confucian literati than a martial arts expert.But Hong Mongzi was clear that Fang Zhidong\u2019s Extreme Elementary Ram was extraordinarily powerful. Even with Hong Mingzi\u2019s strength, it would take him at least over a hundred moves to defeat him. If he was younger, he could get past this man within twenty moves. But now, he had long since passed his prime.\u201cFang Zhidong, are you bent on obstructing me?\u201d Hong Mingzi rebuked somberly.\u201cHow can old Sect Master say that? I came only to be a witness to ensure a fair duel,\u201d Fang Zhidong smiled and glanced at the battle.Soul Locking Spear roared and bellowed under Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s control. Its ferocity and might surpassed even that of Prime Mystic Palm.Lu Sheng ducked and dodged. He had no experience facing such an eccentric weapon and was forced into dire straits.\u201cSwish!\u201dAs he retreated, he pulled out the long saber that had been stabbed into the ground.\u201cDang dang dang!\u201dA series of clangs rang out as Soul Locking Spear hit against Lu Sheng\u2019s blade like a long black whip with extremely dense force.In a moment of carelessness, Lu Sheng was struck on his side and forced backwards. A long streak of injury ripped open instantly across his waist. Soul Locking Spear\u2019s range was too big for Lu Sheng to get near his opponent. Moreover, it could really mete out considerable damage.Lu Sheng glanced at the wound across his waist. Despite his hard body skill, he had still suffered a wound the length of a palm. Blood rapidly seeped out of it, dyeing his robes red.But only for a second. Yin Yang Jade Crane Skill quickly closed up the wound, stemming the blood flow within a breath\u2019s span.\u201cHeh!\u201dA numbing yet itching sensation seeped upwards from his waist. Although it was rapidly suppressed by Yin Yang Jade Crane Skill, it caused Lu Sheng\u2019s expression to change.\u201cNot bad huh\u2026 to think that it\u2019s actually a poison skill\u2026\u201dGongsun Zhanglan, however, did not push on in his offensive. Presently, beads of sweat emerged on his forehead. He had put in all his strength into the past consecutive ten moves. Even if he had accumulated decades of inner force, it was barely enough for his rate of exhaustion. Just a few breaths\u2019 span had consumed almost all his inner force. He needed time to rebuild Qi.\u201cIt\u2019s too late even if you were to beg for your life now,\u201d a murky breath escaped his lips. \u201cThose struck by my Soul Locking Spear will find its poison seeping through their skin and blocking all their meridians and blood vessels within two hours. Not only that, the poison will flow into your heart through your veins, serving up death by heart blockage.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Lu Sheng lifted his saber and stalked slowly towards Gongsun Zhanglan.Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s pupils shrank as he noticed no trace of abnormal changes on the wound along Lu Sheng\u2019s waist.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d he was about to speak when he saw Lu Sheng\u2019s body rapidly inflating like a balloon. Arteries and veins bulged out across his bare upper body, and thick bands of muscles emerged. His entire body had expanded to twice its original size. The blood-red spot on his forehead turned a deeper shade of red.\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m using this move against a human being ever since I\u2019ve created it,\u201d Lu Sheng drew nearer and nearer, two clearly discernible and distinct inner forces radiating out of him at the same time. \u201cPlease don\u2019t disappoint me\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026!\u201d Gongsun Zhanglan had just opened his mouth when he saw that, to his shock, Lu Sheng was charging towards him like a train at twice his previous speed!Massive force propelled Lu Sheng\u2019s saber blade forward, causing a deafening blast across the air.Compared to all his previous saber moves, Lu Sheng\u2019s present strike was so immensely powerful that one would not have believed it came from the same person unless one had seen it with his own eyes.Gongsun Zhanglan felt as if his eyes were pierced with needles. The saber blade was moving too quickly; he could only see its afterimage.Without time for any further thought, he shielded himself with his spear on reflex. The tip of his spear shook violently.\u201cBOOM!!!\u201dSaber and spear collided. The sound that rang out was not the clanging of metal, but the intense blast and tremor of inner force.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Soul Locking Spear was also knocked out of Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s hands by the massive force that came towards him at alarming speed. Knocked high into the air, it landed in the distance with a thud.\u201cDIE!!!\u201d Lu Sheng roared in madness, his eyes widening. Lightning-quick, his palms slammed into Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s chest continuously.Initially, Gongsun Zhanglan was barely able to resist his assault. Towards the end, however, he reached the end of his strength and thoroughly lost all resistance within a few breaths\u2019 span.\u201cBoom boom boom boom boom boom!!!\u201dIn the series of blasts, Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s eyes widened as he was forced backwards, his body shaking uncontrollably like a stalk of reed in the wind. Blood gushed out in spurts from his mouth.Soon, the color of blood was thoroughly drained from his face. His entire body was like a puppet with broken strings, madly assaulted by Lu Sheng.\u201cAAAAAAAARGH!!!\u201dLu Sheng thundered, his eyes bloodshot. He had completely lost his mind, both palms slamming continuously into Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s chest and abdomen frenziedly.Drops of blood were dispersed in the wind, dyeing the ground around them a patch of crimson red.\u201cBig Brother!!!\u201d On the side, his sister-in-law cried and dashed towards Lu Sheng.Snapping out of his daze, Fang Zhidong too quickly shot towards them.By then, Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s pupils were already dilated and out of focus. His five bowels and six viscera had been smashed into a pulp as Lu Sheng kept pushing him backwards.\u201cBOOM!\u201dWith yet another heavy strike, Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s body was thrown up in the air, flew backwards and then finally slammed into the water behind him.Lu Sheng\u2019s face was contorted. Inner force from his entire body flooded into his palms, mixing together Ultimate Crimson Qi, Blood Fury Skill and Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill. Savagely, Lu Sheng struck the position in the water where Gongsun Zhanglan had plunged into.\u201cDIE!!!\u201d\u201cBOOM!\u201dA column of water several meters high exploded upwards, blasting open into countless drops of water above the river surface.Gradually, threads of blood red emerged and spread across the surface of Cypress Pine Lake.No one had expected the tide to change in an instant. Just a few seconds earlier, Gongsun Zhanglan had held the upper hand. Yet, in the blink of an eye, the battle had ended.\u201cBig Brother!\u201d Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s tear-streaked sister-in-law, Zhang Huishu, dashed into the river. Without a care for the water that had risen above her knees, she struggled to pull Gongsun Zhanglan out of the water.Close behind her, Fang Zhidong landed. Upon sight of Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s plight, he sighed and shook his head.\u201cHe didn\u2019t make it,\u201d he glanced at Lu Sheng. This inflated body was the perfect marriage between strength and aesthetics. One look at it struck fear in the heart.\u201cHe picked on someone the wrong size after all\u2026\u201d Fang Zhidong had no intention to avenge Gongsun Zhanglan. The question of whether or not he was a match for Lu Sheng aside, he had his own family, his wife and daughters, to care for. To have delayed Crimson Whale Sect Master Hong Mingzi, he had already done his due and fulfilled his obligation to Gongsun Zhanglan.Lu Sheng had expended almost all his inner Qi in that last series of frenzied assault. But it was in such moments that Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill\u2019s powerful Qi restorative ability was quickly demonstrated. In just a mere seven to eight breaths, Lu Sheng had recovered approximately half of his total volume of inner Qi.\u201cWhy? You want to come at me?\u201d Looking at the two who were staring at him, Lu Sheng\u2019s mouth cracked open in a smile.\u201cYou\u2019ve won,\u201d Fang Zhidong was impassive. He knew that he could not afford to be rash. Once he made a move, if he failed to succeed, he would even implicate everyone else in the Gongsun family; none of them would have a chance to live on.The cruelty of the internal struggles in sects was something completely unimaginable to outsiders. Even if Sect Master Hong Mingzi decided to close the book on the matter, those under him, as well as Gongsun family\u2019s past enemies, would never leave them alone.\u201cI\u2019LL KILL YOU!!!\u201d With bloodshot eyes, Zhang Huishu rose and was about to charge at Lu Sheng when she was struck in the back of her neck by Fang Zhidong and blacked out.\u201cThis was a fair death match. May I ask External Affairs Emissary Lu to show mercy? I, Fang Zhidong, guarantee that the Gongsun family will not seek revenge,\u201d Fang Zhidong clasped his hands together towards Lu Sheng.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d the duo including old Sect Master had come to the shore by then. Staring at Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s body lying in the water, complicated feelings stirred in Hong Mingzi\u2019s heart.This Crimson Whale Deputy Sect Master who had lorded over the Northern Lands for over twenty years had died in a duel just like that.No one could have foreseen this.Originally, Hong Mingzi had thought that Lu Sheng would be at a slight disadvantage, yet not to the extent that his life would be endangered. As long as he intervened in time, there shouldn\u2019t have been much of a problem. But a pity\u2026\u201cGuarantee?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s body slowly recovered to its normal state. Glancing at Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s corpse in the water, a mocking look came on his face. \u201cWho do you think you are? What has it got to do with you whether or not I spare the Gongsun family?\u201d\u201cJunior Apprentice Brother, there\u2019s no harm in agreeing. Gongsun Jing\u2026 she\u2019s all that\u2019s left,\u201d old Sect Master Hong Mingzi sighed. \u201cThe rest of them, be they godsons or goddaughters, are all merely in name. Gongsun Zhanglan could not produce an heir. His parents had died when he was young. He fought alone to become stronger and finally found his younger brother\u2019s family with great effort.A few years ago, his younger brother died too, leaving only Gongsun Jing and his sister-in-law behind. And now even Gongsun Jing\u2026\u201dOnly then did Lu Sheng understand the Gongsun family\u2019s plight. It seemed that Gongsun Zhanglan was the sole pillar propping up the entire family.Seeing that Fang Zhidong was looking at him sincerely without so much as a temper, Lu Sheng heaved a long sigh, instantly losing all interest in pursuing the matter.\u201cSince Senior Apprentice Brother has spoken, I promise not to cause trouble for the Gongsun family.\u201d After all, it was left with only Zhang Huishu. Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s foes were plenty. There was absolutely no need for him to personally finish the job; all that was needed was for him to let out the news, and many experts will come like sharks smelling blood.\u201cMany thanks,\u201d having secured Lu Sheng\u2019s promise, Fang Zhidong tucked Gongsun Zhanglan and Zhang Huishu under his arms and made a run for the distance, quickly vanishing into the forest.With his opponent gone, Lu Sheng rapidly activated his Qi, directing Yin-Yang Jade Crane Qi to the wound on his waist and the internal injuries he had suffered at the start of the match to catalyze and accelerate his body\u2019s recovery. Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill also forcibly contained Soul Locking Spear\u2019s poison to a small region on his waist.\u201cSenior Apprentice Brother, may I borrow a saber?\u201d Lu Sheng borrowed a saber from Hong Mingzi and used it to dig out a large chunk of flesh on his waist.This chuck of flesh had turned black. A foul stench emanated from it. Clearly, Soul Locking Spear\u2019s poison had congealed into clots that blocked the blood vessels.\u201cJunior Apprentice Brother, this duel has truly been an eye-opener for your senior apprentice brother here. Both you and Gongsun Zhanglan threw out trump cards one after the other. And, in the end, he still landed up being openly slain by you,\u201d Hong Mingzi exclaimed.Lu Sheng smiled. In reality, all things being equal, he was no match for Gongsun Zhanglan. However, his inner Qi was seriously way too thick and his Qi replenishing abilities way too strong. Towards the end, Gongsun Zhanglan had run out of inner Qi. Had it not been for that fact, Lu Sheng would unlikely have won; at most, both of them would have been wounded. And, he was likely to have been the one with the more serious injuries.\u201cI\u2019ve long wanted to taste what it\u2019s like to fight to the death. Now I\u2019ve had my fill at last,\u201d a look of satisfaction flooded Lu Sheng\u2019s face. Hurling the chunk of flesh into the river, he pressed hard on the wound at his waist.Ultimate Crimson Mantra activated at accelerated rate. His palm became intolerably hot, cauterizing the wound on his waist in a matter of seconds.\u201cLet\u2019s head back first. I\u2019ve gotta tidy up and rest.\u201d\u201cSince Junior Apprentice Brother won the duel today, you might as well take over as the Deputy Sect Master. When I get back, I\u2019ll dispatch someone to assist you in handling the miscellaneous duties. You just need to deal with the big matters, what say you?\u201d Hong Mingzi suggested.On the side, Elder Wang had not yet recovered from his shock at Lu Sheng\u2019s victory. Now, hearing that Lu Sheng was to succeed as Deputy Sect Master, he immediately waved his hands.\u201cOld Sect Master, don\u2019t do that to Brother Lu. The Deputy Sect Master\u2019s duties and responsibilities are too heavy; the position will surely delay his martial arts cultivation. It\u2019s more suitable to give him the position after he attains full-mastery of his skills.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026 that was my oversight,\u201d Hong Mingzi nodded in realization. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it after we get back.\u201dLu Sheng nodded, \u201cBut before returning, let me bid a friend goodbye first. She was the one who gave me a ride here.\u201dWithout waiting for the two of them to react, Lu Sheng ran towards the ship.By then, the ship had docked by the shore, still under temporary repairs after running into reefs.Atop the ship, the young masters and young ladies had been spectating until they saw Lu Sheng heading for them. Immediately, each one of them hid in their cabins in fright, refusing to come out.In a matter of seconds, all who were left on the deck were Bian Su and her Grand Uncle beside her.\u201cYoung Master!\u201d Ning San hurried forward in salutation.\u201cGive me a moment; let me settle some stuff,\u201d Lu Sheng remarked causally and strode towards the duo including Bian Su.Up till now, both of them remained in a daze. They were shell-shocked by Lu Sheng\u2019s final physical transformation.That aura and might, as well as the drastic rise in speed and strength, left them presently in awe and fright towards Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng smiled at both of them, baring his teeth.\u201cOn account of your favor of giving me a ride, Young Master Bian, you may look for me at the Golden Jade Greenhouse should you have the need. In the Northern Lands, I\u2019m a local, after all. If there\u2019s any trouble, I should be able to be of help.\u201dInstantly, shivers ran down Bian Su\u2019s spine as she thought of Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s plight.Just moments earlier, this man was bellowing like a mad sociopath. Now, however, he was smiling gently at her. And what did that other man on the side call him earlier? Young master?Bian Su stole a glance at Lu Sheng\u2019s bald head and bulging muscles, strong enough to skill an ox with one punch. \u2018HOW ON EARTH DOES HE LOOK LIKE A YOUNG MASTER?!\u2019 She screamed in her heart. Outwardly, however, she could only reply awkwardly, \u201cYoung Master\u2026 you\u2019re too polite\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s curiosity was piqued. What treasure was this Young Master Bian carrying that so many vultures were circling her?\u201cDo you need me to get rid of that irritating scum for you?\u201d He pointed towards the cabins.\u201cEr\u2026 no need\u2026 there\u2019s no need to trouble you, Young Master\u2026\u201d Bian Su hurriedly added.On her side, her Grand Uncle tugged at the corner of her sleeve.\u201cYoung Master Lu. You probably can tell by now that my Young Miss isn\u2019t in a very good situation. If something happens, we may really need your help. Of course, we certainly won\u2019t let you help for free. We understand the gifts required,\u201d he replied with a smile.\u201cMm\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng nodded satisfactorily. This old fogey was rather self-aware. Lu Sheng had after all merely sat in their ship for a while; the favor he received from them was not truly sufficient to warrant his help.His true motivation was of course his curiosity, as well as the possibility of him gaining something from this young lady.He had heard some rumors from those scums that this Young Miss Bian was carrying something useful to himself.\u201cJust go into any casino with the word \u2018Gold\u2019 in its name in Mountain-Edge City and mention my name. There\u2019ll be someone there to receive you. Ning San, stay back and give them instructions, I\u2019ll leave first,\u201d Lu Sheng ordered.\u201cYes, Boss,\u201d Ning San quickly agreed respectfully. After witnessing how Lu Sheng had beaten Gongsun Zhanglan to death like a madman, his reverence and admiration for his Boss increased significantly once more. Unknowingly, his term of address for him had turned into Boss instead of Young Master.\u201cHow many times have I said, call me Young Master!\u201d Lu Sheng was immediately upset.\u201cYes yes yes\u2026 Young Master\u2026\u201d sweat broke out on Ning San\u2019s forehead.Beside them, the duo including Bian Su\u2019s faces contorted as they repressed the urge to guffaw.Without bothering with them anymore, Lu Sheng alighted the ship to look for old Sect Master.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lu Sheng meditated for a while and swallowed several pills to recover bruises and accelerate blood circulation. After two days\u2019 rest, most of his injuries had healed.Once he recovered, he immediately summoned his deputy.The deputy assigned to him by old Sect Master was an effeminate young man who was so pretty that it was ridiculous.This man\u2019s alias was Jade Lotus. He had once been a Taoist priest and was a mere four years older than Lu Sheng.Presently, Lu Sheng was only twenty years old. This meant that Jade Lotus was a mere twenty-four years old. His martial arts skill, however, was extremely impressive. With his Iron Tribulus, he was extraordinarily accomplished in the use of concealed weapons. Once, in a duel with someone, he had formed the pattern of a lotus flower with his Iron Tribulus darts, thus earning him the alias Jade Lotus.In the Golden Peace &amp; Prosperity Restaurant.Both of them sat in Chamber A situated on the topmost floor. Jade Lotus was in plain white long robes, a white ribbon in his hair, which draped down to his waist. His facial features were even more attractive than those of a woman. Sun rays shone into the chamber, reflecting gently off his snow white skin.Lu Sheng sized him up with a peculiar look. Honestly speaking, apart from on the Internet on Earth, this was the first time he had encountered a man like this who was prettier than a woman in real life.If not for the Adam\u2019s apple clearly discernible on his throat, Lu Sheng would probably have thought that he was a woman in disguise.\u201cExternal Head, have you seen enough?\u201d Jade Lotus sat upright, his face expressionless.In the Crimson Whale Sect, the real official designation for External Affairs Emissaries was actually \u201cExternal Head\u201d.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 this is my first time seeing a man as pretty as you, Brother Jade. I got distracted for a moment, my apologies,\u201d Lu Sheng smiled. Under usual circumstances, he was actually a rather mild-mannered man.\u201cYour subordinate also has no idea why I\u2019m like that. It\u2019s been this way since I was young,\u201d Jade Lotus replied.Lu Sheng nodded. He had read Jade Lotus\u2019 file. Jade Lotus had been a pretty boy from childhood and was thus nearly sold as a human pet. But thankfully, he was rescued by the old Sect Master, who had taken him in into Crimson Whale Sect and raised him. Now, he belonged to the Sect Master\u2019s faction as one of his trusted confidants.\u201cRight, then. Let\u2019s look at some troubles that need to be sorted out by External Head now,\u201d Jade Lotus retrieved a roll of sheepskin parchment from his sleeves and unfurled it gently.\u201cFirstly, Mountain-Edge City has now completely fallen under External Head\u2019s jurisdiction. Old Sect Master has given his full confirmation. Of the three harbors under our management, a serial robbery occurred in Eastern Mountain Harbor yesterday. The authorities have made no headway in investigations and have requested our assistance.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll leave this to you to handle. We don\u2019t have many key personnel. Just let Soaring Eagle Squad handle this,\u201d Lu Sheng replied flippantly.\u201cSoaring Eagle Squad comprises Former External Head Wu San\u2019s men\u2013they were all his trusted men, trained by him. Doesn\u2019t External Head Lu intend to remove them from power?\u201d Jade Lotus was surprised.\u201cWhy would I remove them from power? As long as they\u2019re obedient,\u201d Lu Sheng waved his hands dismissively.\u201cAlright, then. Secondly, some trouble has cropped up in Eastern Mountain Society. The son of one of their Branch Chiefs was arrested for instigating trouble in one of our casinos. Now he\u2019s being held by our men. It was someone from Soaring Eagle Squad who did it,\u201d Jade Lotus continued.\u201cLet Soaring Eagle Squad handle their own mess,\u201d Lu Sheng replied lackadaisically.\u201cSoaring Eagle Squad doesn\u2019t care. They want their money repaid, otherwise they\u2019ll break his arm,\u201d Jade Lotus said impassively.\u201cHow much did that lad lose?\u201d Lu Sheng asked.\u201cTwo nights. Ten thousand taels.\u201d\u201cHUH??\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s jaw dropped.Ten thousand taels!!!What kind of figure was that? A tael of silver was equivalent to the purchasing power of a thousand dollars. Ten thousand taels\u2026 that was a billion dollars!Two nights and he lost a billion dollars!?\u201cThe lad thinks that he was scammed of his money, and so would rather die than pay up,\u201d Jade Lotus continued. \u201cOh, and this happened on the day you fought with Gongsun Zhanglan.\u201dLu Sheng became quiet as he narrowed his eyes.\u201cInteresting. Such a big hoo-hah and yet the Soaring Eagle Squad made no report to me in advance. Heh, interesting\u2026\u201d\u201cSoaring Eagle Squad may officially fall under Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s power, but in actual fact it has always been a relatively independent force under External Head Wu San\u2019s command. It\u2019s natural that they\u2019re a little untamed,\u201d Jade Lotus explained.\u201cI don\u2019t need \u2018untamed\u2019. I only want \u2018obedient\u2019,\u201d Lu Sheng rose and looked at Jade Lotus. \u201cOf the thirteen men in Soaring Eagle Squad, each one of them are at the pinnacle of Strength Proficiency. How many of them can you take on?\u201dJade Lotus fell deep into contemplation. Then, slowly, he replied, \u201cOne at most. They\u2019re no average brawlers.\u201d\u201cWhen there\u2019re benefits, they\u2019re happy to keep them to themselves. Only when they\u2019re in trouble do they think of me, the External Head. What good is this Soaring Eagle Squad to me?\u201d Lu Sheng paced about with his hands behind his back.\u201cIf External Head makes a move on them directly, you might just disillusion and discourage our men. External Head Wu San has only just died. And in the line of duty, at that. If you eliminate his trusted confidants now, you\u2019ll be seen as unreasonable, whichever way you look at it.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t give two hoots about anyone\u2019s heart. I only want obedience,\u201d Lu Sheng waved his hand. \u201cWhy has our Crimson Whale Sect been able to draw so many men to join us?\u201dInstantly, the light of realization sparkled in Jade Lotus\u2019 eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s for the name of the Number One sect. It\u2019s powerful enough and offers attractive benefits.\u201d\u201cAnd that\u2019s why no matter how others think, you\u2019ve just got to write out the whole incident from beginning to end and put it up for all to see. The majority of our men merely desire a reason they can use to convince themselves. People always believe that which they want to believe,\u201d Lu Sheng remarked.Jade Lotus thought for a moment and understood Lu Sheng\u2019s drift.Because of Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s power and benefits, a slight bit of discouragement was of no consequence as long as they did not cross the bottom line.Such a method was undoubtedly most apt for a martial arts powerhouse like External Head Lu. Whoever had a disgruntlement could come and look for the External Head. As long as no one kept doing such things, nobody would be truly go against the Sect for the sake of Soaring Eagle Squad.Once he had straightened this out, Jade Lotus immediately started to see Lu Sheng in a new light. Initially, he had thought that this new boss was just a bunch of muscles. Now, however, Lu Sheng took on an air of mystery and imperceptible depth in his eyes. Such deep grasp of human psychology was beyond that of even the counselors or advisors in the yamen.\u201cWe\u2019ll go with that. I\u2019ll leave it to you. You only need to show me the results. Anything else?\u201d Lu Sheng continued.\u201cNothing else. I\u2019m able to handle the rest,\u201d Jade Lotus replied calmly, laying to rest the excitement in his eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you then. I\u2019m going back to train now,\u201d Lu Sheng rose, patted his shoulders, and then strode out without a further word.Soaring Eagle Squad, a faction formerly under Wu San, lasted a mere several days under Lu Sheng\u2019s pressure before disbanding.Their plan was to band together and bargain with their new boss. None of them wished to see what they possessed being reassigned by their new boss once he arrived.After the Eastern Mountain Society-casino incident, however, they had reached the end of their endurance under the pressure of Eastern Mountain Society, which was also a powerful faction in the Northern Lands.It all actually began as a coincidence. This Branch Chief had only just been deployed here from elsewhere and had no time to inform the other factions in the area of his arrival before his son, a gambling nut, rushed into the casino. In the end, he not only lost all his money but also fell into a trap.By the time both sides discovered each other\u2019s backgrounds, it was too late.Soaring Eagle Squad could not stand up under Eastern Mountain Society\u2019s pressure and so had no choice but to seek Lu Sheng\u2019s help. Lu Sheng showed up and made the lad pay back the actual amount that he had lost, which was merely a few thousand taels of silver. The matter ended just like that.Eastern Mountain Society had also learned his name. This was the one who had beaten Gongsun Zhanglan to death; there was no hiding it. Lu Sheng had already become a famous name among the leadership of all the sects, societies and clans.Hence, Eastern Mountain Society was extremely polite towards him as well, taking the initiative to apologize and offer up gifts. The Branch Chief even gifted Lu Sheng with five thousand taels of silver as compensation for his trouble.These were trivial matters to Lu Sheng, however. What he truly cared about was the present status of the Gongsun family.According to his informant, the great Mountain-Edge hero Fang Zhidong escorted Gongsun family\u2019s Zhang Huishu southwards to the Central Plains.Despite escorting her in person, many foes who had heard of Gongsun Zhanglan\u2019s demise still flocked to them. Among them, there were even those of the Intent Proficiency level. Just Strength Proficiency experts alone already numbered more than ten. Many experts from small families who were formerly persecuted by the Gongsun Family now came to settle the score.Some even deliberately obstructed them to do a favor to the current Crimson Whale Sect.Lu Sheng didn\u2019t care about that woman\u2019s whereabouts. After all, Fang Zhidong had given his guarantee, making it unreasonable and morally wrong for Lu Sheng to strike personally. He, too, had a family. Once he broke this rule, others in the future would have an excuse to make a move against his family.Yet, though he could not strike personally, this did not mean that he could not strike indirectly.After Soaring Eagle Squad pledged their allegiance to Lu Sheng, he deployed several of the experts from within to oversee this matter. They did nothing but track Zhang Huishu\u2019s location.He himself, on the other hand, stayed quietly in Mountain-Edge City, studying and training martial arts.***\u201cBAM!!!\u201dA wooden cudgel, the width of an arm, smashed onto Lu Sheng\u2019s head then split open with a ka-cha.\u201cHAHAHAHA! AGAIN!\u201dTopless and covered all over in a layer of medicinal oil, Lu Sheng stood under the hot sun. His bald head glowed as the sun\u2019s rays reflected off it. A masochistic smile was on his face.Around him, several cudgel-wielding muscular men were panting heavily, their eyes nearly rolling over from exhaustion.The men swung the cudgels again, smashing them onto Lu Sheng. After a few more swings, they were spent of their strength.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, what\u2019s wrong? Didn\u2019t any of you eat?! Huh???\u201d Lu Sheng growled with dissatisfaction. \u2018With this strength, are they trying to scratch my itch?\u2019\u201cBoss\u2026 we\u2019re really out of strength\u2026\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an\u2019s face was miserable. He pointed at the seven or eight men who had collapsed on the ground around Lu Sheng, each of them muscular men.\u201cCALL ME YOUNG MASTER!\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s face scrunched up and he slapped Duan Meng\u2019an on his head, almost slamming him into the ground.\u201cYoung Master, Young Master!\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an hurriedly changed his term of address. \u2018This boss is really a weirdo\u2026 he loves people calling him \u201cYoung Master\u201d. But look at him. Which part of him looks like those gentle and meek Young Masters?\u2019Naturally, he wouldn\u2019t have the guts to say any of those thoughts aloud. \u2018Recently, boss\u2019 temper is getting more and more explosive\u2026 god-knows-why! He keeps hitting us out of the blue. Although his beatings aren\u2019t heavy, but it\u2019s still shameful and embarrassing for us to walk out with bruises on our faces, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\u201cAll the registered muscular men in the city base have been summoned here. But we\u2019re all too tired\u2026\u201dDuan Meng\u2019an complained helplessly.Lu Sheng was feeling pissed too. He had been cultivating this Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill for half a month, without even making it to Initiation.This hard body skill was cultivated by subjecting one\u2019s own body to blunt force trauma. Initially, after summoning many muscular men with great strength to hit his body, he seemed to be making progress. But now, just when he sensed that he was just a step away from Initiation, he was finding these muscular men\u2019s strength inadequate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They waved a large piece of vermilion sheepskin parchment that seemed like a notice of sorts.Lu Sheng stared speechless as these people drew close before he raised his palm to violently smack them across their faces.\u201cBAM BAM BAM.\u201dTheir heads swung backwards from the impact, instantly realizing in alarm that they had addressed him wrongly. Quickly, they corrected themselves.\u201cYoung Master! External Head! High\u2026 Highest Honor!\u201d The one with the piece of red parchment in his hand was none other than Ning San. He held in his hands the results of the Annual Examinations, which had finally been released. Although delayed for longer than usual, it was finally out.\u201cHighest Honor?\u201d Lu Sheng snatched over the piece of parchment and unfurled it to read.His name was nowhere to be found in the first row. Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes narrowed into a slit as he glared fiercely at Ning San.\u201cNot even among the top three, Highest Honor my ass!\u201d His hand extended as he was once again about to give this chap a tight slap. At the end of the day, Ning San was uncivilized. Ordinarily, he was fine, but when it came to academic matters, he was thoroughly dimwitted.Ning San immediately cowered in fear to dodge, not daring to answer back. He smiled apologetically, \u201cYour subordinate heard others shouting that, and thought it sounded rather celebratory\u2026\u201dLu Sheng had no words. Scanning the document, he found his name in the thirty-fifth position. \u201cMm, it\u2019s Honors alright, not bad. When you return, withdraw ten taels of silver for your tip, and for everyone else too! Five taels of tips for each person!\u201dInstantly, the faces of those around him brightened.\u201cOh right, Bos\u2026 err\u2026 Young Master, those who put up the results also informed that you have to attend the ceremony in person,\u201d Ning San continued.\u201cWhen?\u201d\u201cAt the height of the Wu hour (one o\u2019clock in the afternoon), the day after.\u201dLu Sheng nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been to the Institution. It\u2019s just about time to head back and visit some old friends.\u201d\u201cSpeaking of which, what a coincidence. That Young Master Bian Su has dropped by twice today to see Young Master,\u201d Ning San continued, \u201cProbably with a favor to ask.\u201d\u201cBian Su\u2026 bring her here to see me then. Act fast,\u201d Lu Sheng instructed.\u201cYes, Young Master,\u201d Ning San turned and ran away from the arena.In the afternoon, Lu Sheng reapplied another layer of medicinal oil and hammered all over his body for a short while. Then, he met once again with Young Master Bian Su.Presently, Bian Su was alone. She wore a haggard expression and seemed especially fatigued.Lu Sheng changed into a set of fresh clothes before bringing her to sit in one of the common rooms by the greenhouse.\u201cYoung Master Bian, what do you need? Feel free to ask. If I\u2019m able to, I\u2019ll definitely do my best to help,\u201d Lu Sheng offered generously in all earnestness, causing a hint of gratitude to surface on Bian Su\u2019s face.\u201cTo be honest, I really do have a favor to ask during this visit,\u201d Bian Su replied solemnly.\u201cPlease, speak,\u201d Lu Sheng signaled for her to continue.Bian Su inhaled deeply, before heaving a sigh. \u201cI wonder if Young Master Lu has heard of the Blood Tree Flower.\u201d\u201cBlood Tree Flower?\u201d Lu Sheng asked, intrigued, \u201cIs it a flower species?\u201d\u201cMore specifically, it\u2019s a precious medicinal herb that blooms and then withers in many decades,\u201d Bian Su explained. \u201cA hundred-year flower has tremendous Qi-replenishing properties and can effectively nourish Yin and soothe heatiness. And in my Bian Family, we were once able to lay our hands on a seven-hundred-year-old Blood Flower Tree. Its Qi-replenishing quality is even more effective than a thousand-year-old mountain ginseng by manifold.\u201d\u201cOh? How powerful!\u201d Lu Sheng was excited. To him, a precious medicinal herb that can tremendously replenish Qi and nourish Yin is good stuff that could speedily upgrade his inner Qi cultivation.\u201cYea, very powerful,\u201d Bian Su nodded. \u201cIf Young Master Lu is interested, then I\u2019m thinking of making a trade with you for this seven-hundred-year-old Blood Tree Flower.\u201d\u201cWhat sort of trade?\u201d Lu Sheng was well aware how invaluable such an herb was. If the purported usefulness of this Blood Tree Flower was real, then in the current circumstances where even thousand-year-old mountain ginseng was a hot property, this precious herb would be able to sell for at least a high price of ten thousand taels. And even so, one might not be able to get one\u2019s hands on it.Bian Su hesitated for a moment before asking solemnly, \u201cI want to request Young Master Lu to send someone to escort me back to the Central Plains.\u201d\u201cYour Bian Family is an established family in the medicinal trade, isn\u2019t that so?\u201d Lu Sheng had long since looked into Bian Su\u2019s family background. Now that he learned of the Blood Tree Flower, his interest was immediately aroused.\u201cYes, my family has engaged in the herbs business for over two centuries, and we have many medicinal fields and mountains. Our farmers and merchants number at least in the thousands,\u201d Bian Su said rather proudly. Before coming, she had naturally also enquired into Lu Sheng\u2019s identity.However, even in front of some big shot of the number one Sect in the North, she remained proud of the past glory her family enjoyed.\u201cAt the height of my family\u2019s prosperity, we enjoyed great popularity and wealth.\u201d\u201cIn that case\u2026 my Crimson Whale Sect also deals in the herbs business, though not on a large scale. Moreover, there are some herbs that are only available in the Central Plains. If Young Master Bian is able to gain control over internal household matters and do business with me after you return, then not only can I send you back, I can even lend you a helping hand,\u201d Lu Sheng said seriously.\u201cIs Young Master Lu serious!?\u201d Bian Su\u2019s eyes lit up in joy.\u201cSerious. However, this helping hand will naturally come at a cost. I also have a large number of men under me, who count on me for a living. After all, it\u2019s not an easy feat managing such a vast territory,\u201d Lu Sheng heaved a long sigh.\u201cI understand,\u201d Bian Su thought for a moment, before adding, \u201cif Young Master Lu is able to help me seize back control of my household, then my Bian Family is willing to fork out thirty percent of our annual profits to offer as compensation to Young Master Lu,\u201d she paused. Then, she added, \u201cEven in turbulent times, our Bian Family\u2019s herb business amounts to more than a million taels in profits. We have many small branches littered across many big provinces in the Central Plains.\u201dAt least three hundred thousand taels per annum?Lu Sheng instantly understood the other party\u2019s intentions; she wanted to inextricably tie him to the interests of the Bian Family. However, he was indeed in a monetary fix right now. Although the Sect did distribute a salary, for a martial arts fanatic like him who consumed copious amounts of nourishing herbs, that sum was simply too inadequate.From the looks of it, this Bian Family was probably more successful than his own Lu Family, but that was about it. Although more than a million taels sounded like an enormous sum, in reality, Chen Yunxi\u2019s Chen Family had offered more than a million as dowry previously.So the so-called many small branches littered across many big provinces was actually nothing more than Bian Su tooting her own horn. It was but a small family herb business in the Central Plains.\u201cI want fifty percent. Thirty percent is peanuts,\u201d Lu Sheng replied flippantly.\u201cFifty percent\u2026!\u201d Bian Su\u2019s face distorted. In fact, portions of the family profits were also distributed to the territorial heads as protection money. After giving Lu Sheng fifty percent, and then subtracting the protection money, the family would be left with a mere thirty percent.This little bit of income was really too little. Yet, she thought of the situation back home. After all, the business was in the hands of an outsider and not in hers.Bian Su clenched her teeth. \u201cFine! Fifty percent it is. Young Master Lu, when will you send someone to escort me back?\u201d\u201cWhen do you want to leave?\u201d Lu Sheng asked.\u201cAs soon as possible,\u201d Bian Su replied.Lu Sheng nodded. Immediately, he clapped his hands to call someone to summon an expert from the Soaring Eagle Squad. \u201cA moment please, Young Master Bian.\u201dThe two of them waited for a short moment before an experienced-looking man sporting a crew cut and dressed head to toe in black walked. He cupped his hands in greeting to Lu Sheng. \u201cBronze Eagle greets External Head!\u201dAll thirteen Soaring Eagles communicated with outsiders using their aliases.\u201cAfter settling the Eastern Mountain Society affair, you and Silver Eagle bring this Young Master Bian back to the Central Plains and help him manage his household affairs. Bring along fifty good men with you from the Sect,\u201d Lu Sheng instructed.\u201cYes!\u201d Bronze Eagle was expressionless as he agreed straightforwardly. Ever since the Soaring Eagle Squad pledged its allegiance, it naturally was in no position to bargain. Even though he was unwilling to travel the long distance to the Central Plains, this was an order from Lu Sheng that he had no choice but to obey.Waving his hand to indicate to Bronze Eagle and Bian Su to discuss the details of their travel in their own time, Lu Sheng rose to return home.By the time he got back home, it was already nighttime. In this period, he had been returning late almost every single day. Occasionally, he didn\u2019t even return.This time round, seeing that he was home, Qiao\u2019er took the chance to mention the happy news that he was on the honor roll. Then, she even brought out a letter from home.\u201cRelocate?\u201d Lu Sheng was mildly surprised as he stared onto the contents of the letter. \u201cDo we have to relocate now?\u201d\u201cSupposedly, everything\u2019s been prepared, and even the contact for the journey has been arranged. Over ten large carriages were rented,\u201d Qiao\u2019er explained softly. She had already received a letter from a dear sister back home and thus was in the know of some things.\u201cMm\u2026 after all, they\u2019ve been preparing for a long while. Even with the horses running at full pelt, it\u2019ll take at least two days\u2019 journey to get from Nine Links City to Mountain-Edge City. Moreover, with the many bulky items they\u2019ll be carrying for the relocation, I fear it\u2019ll take even longer. It\u2019ll probably take four or five days just on the road itself,\u201d Lu Sheng estimated. \u201cAlright, I got it.\u201d\u201cAlso, Young Master, that Young Miss Chen Yunxi has been around many times recently to look for you. Each time, you were away. Qiao\u2019er could see that she was really disappointed,\u201d Qiao\u2019er mentioned this matter with the utmost caution.\u201cChen Yunxi\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng could feel a headache coming on the moment this matter was broached. What kind of life did he lead? One moment, he\u2019s battling someone to the death; another, and he\u2019s head to head with ghosts. It really wasn\u2019t the time to get married.\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about that for now. Anyone else came to look for me?\u201d\u201cYoung Master Song Zhenguo did as well, he came here many times. He wanted Qiao\u2019er to ask on his behalf when you intend to give him the test,\u201d Qiao\u2019er continued.Only now did Lu Sheng remember that there was still the matter of Song Zhenguo wanting to learn martial arts. Before, he had forgotten about it and concentrated on settling other issues.\u201cThis is nothing urgent either. When I\u2019m at the Institution the day after, I will arrange for someone to begin to look into this,\u201d from what he understood of his old man Lu Quanan, although he was not a risk taker, he was extremely safe and reliable when making decisions. He must have long since laid eyes on Mountain-Edge City as a suitable place for the family to settle down at, and might have even already purchased the land. Because Lu Sheng had been fully occupied with his martial arts training and consolidating his newly-attained power, he hadn\u2019t had the time to pay any attention to family matters.\u201cAlso, there\u2019s Lu Yingying. That lass came with me to Mountain-Edge City, yet after being at Eastern Mountain Institution for so long, I\u2019ve actually not even seen a trace of this younger sister of mine. God-knows-where she\u2019s been roaming.\u201dLu Yingying was a good for nothing, self-absorbed vainpot who gallivanted all day with her so-called sisters back in Nine Links City. They would at times go on hikes, at times attend poetry recitals, at times go to admire flowers\u2026 they even chased after Nine Links City\u2019s popular pretty boy, Wei Xing, like crazy teenage fangirls, vying for his affection. In short, she was not one to keep still. Yet, she had actually maintained a low profile here in Mountain-Edge City, which caused Lu Sheng to be rather surprised.\u201cQiao\u2019er did hear of Fifth Young Miss\u2019 matters\u2026\u201d Qiao\u2019er said somewhat hesitatingly.\u201cHow is she now? If I don\u2019t remember wrongly, our family arranged a bookstore for her to cover her expenses, isn\u2019t that so?\u201d Lu Sheng asked.\u201cYes\u2026 when Qiao\u2019er went to buy spices a while back, I even chanced upon Fifth Young Miss on the street along the old Tang garden,\u201d Qiao\u2019er\u2019s voice lowered to a whisper, \u201cThen, I saw that she was with a young master, a scholar \u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Kurisu\u201cScholar?\u201d Lu Sheng paused in surprise.\u201cYea\u2026 that scholar seems wealthy. Both of them displayed very affectionate and intimate behavior towards each other\u2026\u201d Qiao\u2019er was afraid to go further. This matter had actually weighed on her heart for a while. However, as it concerned her master\u2019s family, she dared not speak about it as long as Lu Sheng did not ask her.\u201cA wealthy, scholar Young Master? I did say that this brat was an extravagant prodigal. How would the earnings of a store be enough for her spending? So turns out that\u2019s how\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng instantly understood. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got to see for myself who dares to mess with my Lu Family,\u201d his eyes turned sinister.\u201cNo\u2026 it\u2019s not like that, Young Master. It looks to me that Fifth Young Miss and he are very intimate with each other\u2026 it doesn\u2019t look like\u2026 like that kind of situation,\u201d Qiao\u2019er waved her hand anxiously. \u201cThat Young Master looks very gentlemanly and chivalrous. He\u2019d agree to anything the Fifth Young Miss wants. Both of them look very blissful together.\u201d\u201cHmm? Blissful?\u201d Lu Sheng looked shocked. Was it true? He knew Lu Yingying\u2019s temper all too well. How could such a brat find a wealthy, gentlemanly and chivalrous Young Master scholar? \u201cQiao\u2019er, are you sure you aren\u2019t mistaken?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sure,\u201d Qiao\u2019er quickly confirmed. \u201cAt first, Qiao\u2019er also thought that I was mistaken. But after tailing them for a distance, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong.\u201dLu Sheng was speechless. He was very familiar with Lu Yingying\u2019s personality. If the two of them were really in love with each other, that was all right with Lu Sheng. But if the guy was merely trying to take advantage of her, then he had better do some digging around.\u201cForget it, I\u2019ll handle this matter. Go and rest, Qiao\u2019er,\u201d he instructed.Qiao\u2019er hesitated, \u201cWould Young Master like to bathe and change?\u201d\u201cNo need, I\u2019ll do it next morning,\u201d Lu Sheng stretched and popped his neck.\u201cYes sir,\u201d Qiao\u2019er silently left, leaving Lu Sheng alone in the room by the round table. Lightly holding onto a wine cup between his fingers, he poured himself a cup of almond wine and sipped it.\u2018Since I killed Gongsun Zhanglan till now, something in my body seems to have gone amiss\u2026\u2019 his brows were locked tight together. Casting aside all other thoughts, he closed his eyes in deep thought.He searched his memory in detail. His temper had recently been getting hotter and hotter. After waking up each morning, he could feel his skin boiling hot and his Qi and blood seemed to be circulating at accelerated speed.\u2018And when did this phenomenon begin?\u2019He scrutinized his memory.\u2018Seems like it gradually started ever since I began cultivating Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill.\u2019He retrieved the Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill manual again and read it carefully, scrutinizing every line and word. Very quickly, he found a small row or words on page three, slightly below the middle of the page.\u2018Cultivators must make their bodies hot and oily, without any moisture, accompanied by medicinal oil applied to the entire body. Abstain from contact with water for three hours. Only then can Qi be sensed.\u2019Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill was in fact a hard body skill built on the foundation of inner Qi. It was an extremely rare hard body skill that cultivated inner Qi to strengthen the bones, muscles and skin. Strictly speaking, it was an inner force skill rather than outer force skill.This was also one of the reasons why Lu Sheng had chosen it.\u2018Make my body hot and oily, without any moisture, accompanied by medicinal oil applied to the entire body. Abstain from contact with water for three hours\u2026 doesn\u2019t that equal to putting the body in a state of extreme heatiness?\u2019 Realization finally dawned on Lu Sheng.\u2018My Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill\u2019s function is precisely to maintain balance between Yin and Yang, keeping the body in a state of equilibrium between heat and cold. Don\u2019t tell me that Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill is the reason why I haven\u2019t been able to attain Initiation in Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill?\u2019 Lu Sheng postulated. \u2018Next time, I can try practicing Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill after exhausting Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill.\u2019The next morning, he rose and wolfed down his breakfast, then tidied up and got ready to leave.\u201cThump-thump-thump.\u201dBefore he could put on his belt, a series of knocks rang out on the door.Qiao\u2019er hopped over to open the door. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cIs Brother Lu in?\u201d Song Zhenguo was here again. \u201cMiss Qiao\u2019er, it\u2019s been a few days since we last met, how do you do?\u201d Song Zhenguo\u2019s voice rang out from outside the door.\u201cOh, Young Master Song. Our Young Master is in,\u201d Qiao\u2019er chirped in reply. She had a good impression of this Young Master Song who came almost every day recently.\u201cBrother Song, long time no see,\u201d Lu Sheng finished tidying his robes and walked out of the bedroom with a grin.The door opened and the haggard-looking Song Zhenguo entered to see Lu Sheng\u2019s shiny bald head and arms as thick as thighs. Song Zhenguo\u2019s jaws dropped.\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re Brother Lu!?\u201dLu Sheng couldn\u2019t help it too. Ever since he started cultivating hard body skills, his body grew more and more muscular, like an inflating balloon. Now, he couldn\u2019t even cover up his powerful muscles that made him look like an ox with an outfit of black robes.\u201cMy fault. I haven\u2019t been picky in my diet recently and before I knew it, I became like that\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng chuckled bitterly. \u201cCome, come, come. Sit down and talk.\u201dHe pulled Song Zhenguo into the room to a seat.\u201cBrother Lu, may I know when you can test Zhenguo? I can\u2019t wait any longer,\u201d Song Zhenguo refused the seat, his face a look of pain.\u201cTest\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng could tell that Song Zhenguo had really reached the end of his patience. The Red Decks pleasure boat incident had really left a scar on him. Even now, he looked down in the gutters.\u201cBrother Lu, truth be told, I\u2019ve also visited many martial arts dojos in the city during this period of time. Pity\u2026 they\u2019re able to make one fit and strong. But none of them have got real skills to show like Brother Lu\u2019s,\u201d Song Zhenguo smiled helplessly.Lu Sheng shook his head, watching this pitiful forlorn man.\u201cAlright then. Let\u2019s make it today. Today we\u2019ll test Brother Song\u2019s innate talent. But to put it bluntly, don\u2019t get your hopes up.\u201dSong Zhenguo\u2019s face was a look of determined resolve. \u201cEven so, I\u2019d like to try.\u201dLu Sheng rose. \u201cFollow me then.\u201dHe instructed Qiao\u2019er to settle her own meals herself and to check on his family\u2019s progress in migrating. He himself, however, took Song Zhenguo out of Mountain-Edge City. Both of them rode along the official main route and quickly arrived at the small clearing in the forest where Lu Sheng used to practice martial arts.In the morning after a drizzle, the air was crisp fresh. Drops of dew hung on the leaves and grass.\u201cRight here will do.\u201dLu Sheng stood in the middle of the forest, tied up the horses and then turned to look at Song Zhenguo.\u201cHow will I be tested?\u201d Anticipation shone together with nervousness in Song Zhenguo\u2019s eyes.He had met with too many setbacks. Every dojo he had visited thought him out of his mind when they heard his request. The kind of standard he desired was beyond the reach of even the dojo owners.Only then did he realize what league Lu Sheng belonged to.\u201cHonestly speaking, I also have no idea how to test you. But I\u2019ve got quite a few skills up my sleeves. I can impart a basic mantra to you and assess your suitability,\u201d Lu Sheng said calmly.\u201cMantra? You mean like an inner force skill?!\u201d Song Zhenguo was shaken. After visiting so many martial arts dojos, he deeply understood how well martial arts experts kept their skills hidden. Inner force mantras were priceless treasures. And yet now he was about to be imparted one in person by an inner force expert.\u201cDon\u2019t get too uptight. This is merely one of the most basic mantras. There\u2019s only one level to it. As long as you don\u2019t impart it to anyone else, there\u2019ll be no problems,\u201d Lu Sheng said casually. In his mind, he had already decided what to impart Song Zhenguo.Among the inner force skills he knew, there were Green Pine One Thought Formula, Yin-Yang Attraction, Black Fury Skill, Jade Crane Skill, and Ultimate Crimson Mantra.Naturally, there was no way he could divulge Ultimate Crimson Mantra easily. Black Fury Skill required an extremely long time to cultivate\u2013nearly ten times longer than other inner force skills. That was clear from the amount of time it took for him to generate and sense a thread of Qi back then. It was a skill with an extremely high barrier to entry.Hence, the only skills he could impart were the remaining life force skills.Of course, there were also the integrated inner force skills that were the results of his own extrapolation. But Lu Sheng had made up his mind never to divulge these integrated inner force skills until the time came when he had achieved full mastery of all his skills and had satisfied the prerequisites to create his own martial arts. When that time came, he\u2019d think about whether or not to impart them.\u201cYou must promise me a few things before I impart you this mantra. Firstly, you shall not teach it to others. Secondly, if you feel any discomfort while cultivating it, you must cease immediately. Thirdly, the sect I belong to is the Crimson Sun Sect. If you fail to learn this inner force mantra, I can teach you outer force martial arts. But you must first join my Crimson Sun Sect.\u201dLu Sheng felt that Crimson Sun Sect was really pathetically small. He believed that the best policy was for it to expand its ranks. After all, if anything was to be done, they needed manpower. Solely relying on the Crimson Whale Sect model was too dispersed and lacked organizational unity.Moreover, he needed a faction that belonged to him alone. Teaching Song Zhenguo was merely the first step.\u201cI give my word to all three conditions!\u201d Song Zhenguo was deeply aware that this was a golden opportunity that would never come again. Not everyone could get in contact with an expert of Lu Sheng\u2019s league. Hence, he agreed to the conditions without any hesitation.\u201cYou\u2019ve thought it through? Unless you can attain the pinnacle level of simultaneous inner and outer force mastery, you may only be an outer disciple of my Crimson Sun Sect for the rest of your life,\u201d Lu Sheng came up with an identity on the spot.\u201cI\u2019ve long since thought it through,\u201d Song Zhenguo said fixedly. \u201cShould I take you as my Master or\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you can generate inner Qi, you may take me as your Master. But if not\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head without a word. If Song Zhenguo was unable to cultivate inner Qi, there was no point in him taking Lu Sheng as his Master. All Lu Sheng\u2019s strength came from his simultaneous cultivation of inner and outer force; if either was missing, he would never amount to anything much.\u201cI understand,\u201d Song Zhenguo nodded.\u201cWell, then, let\u2019s begin. Learn from me,\u201d Lu Sheng said flatly.He pulled out two pieces of gray cloth and lay them on the ground, then sat down on one of them cross-legged.Song Zhenguo followed his example, likewise sitting cross-legged.\u201cQuiet the mind and still the heart.\u201d\u201cQuiet the mind and still the heart!\u201d Song Zhenguo was a face of solemnness.\u201cClose your eyes.\u201d\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d Song Zhenguo shut his eyes.\u201cEmpty your mind. Don\u2019t think of anything. Relax your body. Don\u2019t flex your muscles\u2026 \u2026\u201d Lu Sheng guided Song Zhenguo, instruction by instruction. Together, they began to cultivate Green Pine One Thought Formula.He knew that the Red Decks pleasure boat had caused trouble for Song Zhenguo because his body was of the extremely rare type\u2013born in the Yin hour, Yin month, and Yin year.Lu Sheng was ignorant of what was so special about such people that even ghosts would hunt them down. But they had to be different from your average mortal.Lu Sheng quickly finished explaining the front section of Green Pine One Thought Formula\u2019s Level One, which led to Initiation.Clearing the mind of all thoughts\u2013this was originally an incredibly difficult step. The human mind was filled with a million thoughts, each different from the other. Babies aside, how could adults so easily clear their minds of thoughts and empty their hearts?Unexpectedly to Lu Sheng, Song Zhenguo had only sat for an hour when he fell into a meditative trance.\u2018Although this life force skill was one of the easiest\u2013having been known to generate Qi sense within a day\u2013isn\u2019t this pace too fast?\u2019After all, once one enters a meditative trance, it\u2019s very easy to generate Qi sense.\u201cTeacher Lu, I sense a fine thread circulating between my chest and abdomen, forming a cycle,\u201d Song Zhenguo spoke just as Lu Sheng finished his thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0KurisuLu Sheng first stared at him in shock, then felt speechless.\u2018I had to spend four whole hours before I could sense Qi back when I was cultivating it. Those born in the Yin hour, Yin month, Yin year are truly different from the rest of us.\u2019Lu Sheng refocused and quickly explained, \u201cThat\u2019s the Initiation Qi sense. You need to spend at least four hours every day nurturing and stabilizing this thread of Qi. Otherwise, if you leave it be, it will dissipate within days. It\u2019s been formed by the energy and essence of the food you eat. If you do not stabilize it with your heart and mind, your body will automatically convert it into other forms of energy and absorb it.\u201d\u201cIn that case, Teacher Lu, how long does this stabilization period take?\u201d Song Zhenguo opened his eyes, joy writ large over his face. He had not expected that it would come so easily for him.\u201cYou\u2019ve got pretty good innate talent. But this inner force skill is of a high quality so it takes slightly more time to cultivate it. You just need three years to stabilize the Initiation Qi sense. After that, you can choose to cultivate the Level One mantra,\u201d Lu Sheng estimated based on the duration described on the manual.\u201cTHREE YEARS!!!???\u201d Song Zhenguo croaked, his smile frozen on his face.Seeing that Lu Sheng possessed a deep cultivation and shocking accomplishments in martial arts at such a young age, he had assumed that martial arts could be trained in a short period of time as long as one had the gift for it. Little did he expect that just a mere Initiation into an inner force skill would take three years to stabilize.\u201cWell, you\u2019re already considered gifted. Others might need four to five years,\u201d Lu Sheng continued. \u201cThis is the reason why it\u2019s far harder to become an inner force expert than an outer force expert. The time it takes is too long. And the gains are not necessarily commensurate with the time it takes. Many inner force experts have labored for decades only to die under the hands of others because they did not know combat skills. It\u2019s a pity.\u201dDuring this period, he had learned of many stories from the pugilistic world while he consulted old Sect Master about Ultimate Crimson Mantra. Finally, he was no longer a blank slate like in the beginning. Now, his words made much more sense.\u201cIn that case, I can supplement myself with outer force skills?\u201d Song Zhenguo asked again.\u201cYou\u2019ve decided to join my Crimson Sun Sect then?\u201d Lu Sheng countered.\u201cI\u2019ve decided!\u201d Song Zhenguo was a face of earnestness.\u201cYou do understand that once you step into the sect, you must never betray or leave the sect. Otherwise, you will be hunted by our own; your life would be for the taking,\u201d Lu Sheng asked again solemnly.\u201cI\u2019m certain!\u201d Song Zhenguo nodded vigorously. \u201cMay Master Lu please teach me!\u201d Clasping his hands together, he fell to his knees before Lu Sheng and began kowtowing to him.Lu Sheng made no effort to stop him. This was the rule. They may have been friends, but this was a different story. There was no free meal in this world, neither would anyone give something for free.Moreover, he had once saved Song Zhenguo\u2019s life. It wasn\u2019t unreasonable now for him to receive Song Zhenguo\u2019s kowtow.One kowtowed while the other sat still. After a series of nine consecutive kowtows, Lu Sheng pulled Song Zhenguo up.\u201cFor the time being, I won\u2019t tell you much about our Crimson Sun Sect. You must first train hard. When the time comes in the future, I\u2019ll let you in on more.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Blood covered Song Zhenguo\u2019s forehead, demonstrating his passion and fervor.For an ordinary scholar to have faced the ghost ship Red Decks without fear, he had guts beyond ordinary men.\u201cRemember this formula. The name of this skill is Green Pine One Thought Formula. First, stabilize your Initiation Qi sense. Next, I\u2019ll see what martial arts are suitable for you,\u201d having received the nine kowtows from Song Zhenguo, Lu Sheng\u2019s attitude towards him was now different.He stood and performed a few simple movements. They were special movements required by several outer force skills.Song Zhenguo rose and did his best to copy them. But by the third movement, he was no longer able to keep up. His body\u2019s joints were too stiff and fixed. That was the consequence of missing out on martial arts training during childhood.Roughly estimating the range of Song Zhenguo\u2019s joints, Lu Sheng shook his head. This fella had pretty good talents, but was destined to be ill-suited for outer force skills. Much of his body was too stiff and fixed in shape.He pondered and said, \u201cYour body is too rigid and stiff\u2026 you can only practice some simple basic outer force skills. I\u2019ll impart you with a movement.\u201dHe thought about a novel he had read in the past. There was a character named Ah Fei who drilled himself hard in a particular sword thrust. Because he had focused all his energy on practicing just one sword move, it became incredibly powerful.Lu Sheng wanted to try if this method could work since Song Zhenguo\u2019s bones and joints were fixed anyway.\u201cLegend has it that when one trains a move over a thousand times, even ten thousand times, hundred thousand times, a million times\u2026 that move will become frighteningly powerful. I don\u2019t buy it. Naturally, this method would result in incredible force; but it would also come with many hidden injuries beyond the limit of what ordinary men can take. Perhaps before achieving that frighteningly powerful force, one\u2019s body would first be crippled.But no doubt this is the idea for a shortcut. A way to develop some combat capabilities far faster than the average expert,\u201d Lu Sheng looked at Song Zhenguo, whose eyes shone with a glint as he listened on.\u201cSo it works for me?\u201d Song Zhenguo asked eagerly.Lu Sheng nodded.\u201cYou can try it. I will custom-design a movement suitable for you. Practice it every day and it might develop into something powerful enough.\u201d By designing a movement that avoids the stiff joints on Song Zhenguo\u2019s body, and accompanying it with a life force inner Qi skill, any hidden injuries that came with this method should be reduced to a minimum.Song Zhenguo\u2019s eyes shone even brighter.Time ticked by.By the time both of them exited the forest, it was noon. Song Zhenguo was extremely high-spirited and excited as he bade farewell to Lu Sheng, rushing back to train his newly-learned inner and outer force skills.\u2018At first, it\u2019s all novel to you. But when you train hard every day with no apparent progress, you\u2019ll know how tough it is. Being a double inner-outer force cultivator, it doesn\u2019t matter how talented you are; without at least five years of work, you won\u2019t even be considered a third-class expert,\u2019 Lu Sheng shook his head lightly as he glanced at the title deed in his hand.This was Song Zhenguo\u2019s donation to the Sect after being imparted those skills. Basically, it was his gift for his Master.It was a cosmetic store in the second most prosperous strip in Mountain-Edge City. Every plot of land there was worth its weight in gold. The store itself was easily worth ten thousand taels\u2013a sum that was considered hefty even for Song Zhenguo.Keeping the title deed, Lu Sheng clapped his hands.Soon, a few sect disciples on guard nearby came sprinting over.\u201cExternal Head!\u201d\u201cGo investigate: which man has my sister Lu Yingying been sticking around with recently?\u201d Lu Sheng ordered.\u201cYes, sir,\u201d the sect disciples acknowledged respectfully and swiftly left to relay the order.Having settled Song Zhenguo\u2019s matter, Lu Sheng arranged for men to keep watch over the city gates and wait for news about the Lu Family\u2019s migration.Because of the distance, it was inconvenient for him to arrange for an escort for them. Moreover, his family did not know that he had joined Crimson Whale Sect and become a big shot yet. He intended to give them a surprise when his old Dad arrived.The next day, Lu Sheng headed to Eastern Mountain Institution to attend the ceremony.Lu Sheng saw Chen Yunxi, whom he had not met for a long time, again. This Young Miss looked more thin and pallid than before. But when Lu Sheng entered her view, her spirits visibly lifted and a look of joy flashed across her face.The ceremony was very boring. Simply put, it was a ceremonial officer reciting some long traditional poem atop a round stone stage surrounded by four drums.The crowd beneath the stage stirred drowsily.Lu Sheng and Song Zhenguo stood among those on the stage. They were decked in white-based, red-bordered long robes and wore tall, pointy black hats.Chen Yunxi did not make it to the roll of honor. Among those of them that used to hang out together, only Song Zhenguo and Lu Sheng did. One of them ranked number sixteen and the other thirty-odd. The rest of them stared in envy at those on the stage.Lu Sheng looked at the crowd beneath him. Beside his ears, Song Zhenguo\u2019s whisper rang out, \u201cNext year, we\u2019ll be eligible to take the Governmental Examinations in the province. Master Lu, will you be going?\u201d\u201cGovernmental Examinations\u2026 \u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s face remained impassive. He sucked in a breath of air. With his present status as External Affairs Emissary of Crimson Whale Sect, commanding great authority and overseeing the security and stability of the entire underworld in Mountain-Edge City, was there still any point in him sitting for the examinations?Even if he did pass the Governmental Examination and became an Academic Nominee, what then? After that he could become a Tribute Scholar, and then afterwards an Advanced Scholar. But what use was that in the current world he lived in?Lu Sheng sighed, his eyes staring blankly ahead.\u201cLet\u2019s wait and see,\u201d he was already uninterested in taking the next level of examinations.\u201cWhy not Master Lu take a martial degree?\u201d Song Zhenguo suggested. \u201cGiven Master Lu\u2019s skills, a martial degree is simply for the taking.\u201d\u201cSo what if I become an official?\u201d Lu Sheng asked.\u201cIf you become an official\u2026 if you become an official\u2026\u201d Song Zhenguo hesitated. He wanted to defend himself. But the more he thought, the more disillusioned he became. \u201cYea\u2026 so what if you become an official\u2026\u201d he slumped.\u201cPay respects to the Holy Man!\u201d The ceremonial official\u2019s loud voice rang out, interrupting their dialogue.All who were chosen on the roll of honor bowed respectively to the bronze stature of the Holy Man on the elevated stage.The Holy Man Zhao Mu\u2013honored by people as Master Zhao\u2013was the pioneer founder of the Confucian imperial examination policy. After his death, he was conferred the title of \u201cHoly Man\u201d. At the end of the day, he was just an ordinary mortal who had made great contributions to society.Lu Sheng gazed at the bronze statue of the old man silently, his face expressionless as he bowed together with the rest.\u2018In the days to come, am I going to be like this\u2013having to bow to my superiors, the Emperor and all those above me?\u2019 A thought flashed across his mind.A thread of resolve was formed in his mind as he bowed.\u2018Where on earth has there ever been this rule: that the strong must bow to the weak?\u2019 Listening to the ceremonial official\u2019s long-winded lines, his heart settled down.\u2018Becoming an official? Forget it.\u2019***In a deserted mountain filled with lush greenery between Nine Links City and Mountain-Edge City, a big band of carriages marched on slowly along a dusty road like a merchant group.Tall flags rose up from the carriages\u2013black flags with a \u201cLu\u201d character embroidered on them.There were over ten horses and oxen, several huge carts, about forty men and women, as well as over a dozen soldiers escorting them. The rest of them were either direct descendants of the Lu Family or their relatives. Thick gray cloth was draped over the horse and ox carriages. Lu Quanan rode on his horse at the front of the line. Beside him were Uncle Zhao and the few martial arts experts hired by the family.Dusk gradually descended. Uncle Zhao squinted his eyes at his surroundings.\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of nowhere. We should have rested for the night in Jia Rong Town earlier.\u201dLu Quanan shook his head, \u201cThere\u2019s no point. We\u2019re right in the middle of the journey. Our speed\u2019s too slow. Even with an additional day, we wouldn\u2019t make it.\u201dHe turned around to look an ox carriage behind him. Its wheel showed signs of recent repairs.\u201cAi\u2026 we wouldn\u2019t be so slow if the car hadn\u2019t fallen into the pit earlier and damaged its wheel. It\u2019s been four days and we\u2019re only halfway there. I wonder how Sheng\u2019er and Yingying are doing in Mountain-Edge.\u201d\u201cRelax, old Master. Young Master Sheng is well-trained and won\u2019t fall into a disadvantage,\u201d Uncle Zhao smiled. At the mention of Lu Sheng, he was filled with admiration. He believed that even in Mountain-Edge City, it was extremely rare for someone to become an Intent Proficiency expert at such a young age like Lu Sheng.\u201cI\u2019m just afraid he\u2019ll get into trouble\u2026\u201d Lu Quanan sighed.\u2018Get into trouble?\u2019Uncle Zhao did not know how to reply.\u201cSince your mind is unsettled, why did you allow Young Master Sheng to go to Mountain-Edge City alone?\u201d\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to limit him. Sheng\u2019er belongs to a different world from us. He\u2019s still young and there\u2019s no telling just what he will be capable of in the future,\u201d Lu Quanan shook his head.Uncle Zhao understood him and fell speechless. Soon, he changed the topic.\u201cIt\u2019s getting late, we better find a place for the night. Otherwise, it\u2019s no joke to stay out through the freezing night in the deserted wilderness.\u201d\u201cMm. Uncle Zhao, is that a village there?\u201d Lu Quanan suddenly pointed at the area in front to the right.Uncle Zhao\u2019s line of sight followed along Lu Quanan\u2019s finger. Beside the main path between two moss green cliffs, a few houses built of mud-walls formed a village. But it looked extremely dilapidated and run-down.\u201cLet\u2019s go take a look and see if we can buy a night\u2019s stay.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A dozen dilapidated mud-wall houses sat here and there, without any apparent order or planning. In the middle of the village was an intersection of two rudimentary paths.The sounds made by Uncle Zhao and his band of men were extremely jarring in the deathly silent village.\u201cIs anybody here?\u201d Uncle Zhao walked to the front of the village and shouted.His shout echoed inside the village, but there was no activity to be heard or seen in response.\u201cIs there anyone?\u201d he asked again.The village remained silent.Behind him, the soldiers frowned. Dispersing at Uncle Zhao\u2019s hand signal, they tiptoed into the village.Slowly, they checked every single house, one by one.\u201cKa-thump.\u201dA soldier accidentally knocked into the handle of a flour grinder. The wooden handle snapped immediately and landed on the ground.A dozen lines of sight zoomed in in his direction. Uncle Zhao strode over to the flour grinder and scrutinized it.He touched the spot where the handle had broken off. When he lifted his finger, it was covered in a layer of yellowish-brown wood dust.\u201cThis is an old village. Which of you have been here before? It\u2019s near the main path so it should be visible to any travelers along it.\u201dThe band of soldiers looked at one another and shook their heads.\u201cI\u2019ve heard my old Dad mention that he used to travel to Mountain-Edge City when he was young and had once spent the night in a village along the way. No idea whether this is the place\u2026\u201d a muscular soldier said in a boorish voice.\u201cYour old Dad is sixty now. When he was young\u2026 wouldn\u2019t that be decades ago?\u201d Another soldier replied.\u201cThirty years ago, perhaps. It\u2019s so long ago that I might as well not have said it,\u201d the thickly-set soldier replied with a chuckle.\u201cThis village seems deserted,\u201d Uncle Zhao stood up and surveyed from left to right. \u201cGo make another round to check again. If nothing is out of the ordinary, we could spend the night here.\u201dDue to all sorts of mishaps in the recent years, there have been many cases of entire villages migrating or fleeing. Consequently, an empty village was nothing strange.Often, an epidemic was sufficient to cause a whole village to uproot and migrate, leaving behind a ghost town-like village.\u201cYes, sir!\u201dThey scattered themselves all over to check. A total of eighteen mud houses sat in the village; all swept by them. Half of them had broken down; there were either gaping holes in the roofs or collapsed walls in the houses.Uncle Zhao and his men tidied up the remaining mud houses, then dispatched a messenger to inform Lu Quanan, who had been waiting on the main path.Then, Lu Quanan brought everyone else and drove the ox carts into the village slowly.\u201cThere\u2019re a few larger mud houses. Let\u2019s allocate them accordingly and make do for the night. We\u2019ll continue on the way tomorrow. Arrange sentries for the night,\u201d Lu Quanan commanded everyone to set up camp for the night.Just the mud houses alone were naturally insufficient for all of them to lodge in. Their priority were the women and children. The Northern Lands were not nearly as comfortable as other places; the temperature drops drastically at night, sometimes to freezing point. It was very easy to catch a cold.\u201cThere\u2019s a well in the middle of the village. We can fetch water from it. The forest is right beside us. Bring some men to pick some dried twigs. And look around to see if there is any game or mushrooms and the like. But don\u2019t go far\u2013watch your safety.\u201dLu Quanan had traveled to a lot of places when he was younger and so was experienced. Very soon, he had everything set in order.\u201cDispatch a messenger to Mountain-Edge City. Say that our progress will be delayed by a few days because a wheel had broken down,\u201d Lu Quanan instructed a soldier.\u201cGot it, Old Master,\u201d these soldiers were city guards arranged by Lu Anping as escorts, who were here at their superior\u2019s command. Moreover, the Lu Family has been treating them well along the way. Just by escorting them along this journey, each of them would earn five taels of silver, which was equivalent to two months\u2019 salary. Naturally, they had no complaints.The soldier flipped himself onto a horse, brought along some rations and rushed towards Mountain-Edge City.By then, a campfire was lit in the village. A large pot of soup was being prepared.Lu Chenxin alighted from his horse carriage to stretch. Originally, he was supposed to seek further studies with Lu Yiyi. Given his lackadaisical nature, however, there was no way he could put up with the meager lifestyle in an institution. With many excuses and fake illnesses, he missed the departure date, leaving Lu Yiyi to head to Xichuan Town alone.\u2018Heheh, Mountain-Edge City is much more exciting. What fun is there in Xichuan Town? Brother Sheng must be having the time of his life there. I heard that there\u2019re plenty of pleasure boats \u2026 I\u2019m in for a good time once we get there,\u2019 Lu Chenxin chuckled in anticipation as he looked around.He was put in the same carriage as Zhang Xiuxiu\u2019s family, relatives of Lu Quanan\u2019s first wife. Lu Tianyang was also in the carriage, making for a cramped ride.But Zhang Xiuxiu was born with a pretty face and her body soft to the touch. So, he had been enjoying the ride.Zhang Xiuxiu was a distant relative descended from Lu Sheng\u2019s maternal grandfather. She was, in fact, not related to Lu Chenxin by blood.Since her father was not doing well, he had thrown in his lot with the well-endowed Lu Family.Furthermore, Zhang Xiuxiu was born out of wedlock; rumor has it that her father had hooked up with a lady in some brothel. Anyway, only her dad raised her up since the time she was taken into the family.Perhaps as a result, she grew up living loosely. Owing to her good looks, she had some unclear connections to Lu Tianyang of the Lu Family, and even Sun Bajun.Now that these people were out of the picture, Lu Chenxin finally had his turn to taste this forbidden fruit. Naturally, he was in an extremely good mood.Lu Tianyang also alighted from another carriage by the side.The two of them made eye contact, and drew near to each other.\u201cHow was it? How did Xiu\u2019er taste?\u201d\u201cNot bad, not bad\u2026 she takes the initiative much more than Yuelan. She\u2019s got kick,\u201d Lu Chenxin whispered in a chuckle.\u201cSame house tonight?\u201d Lu Tianyang was born of Lu Quanan\u2019s fourth concubine and had also earned himself the repute of a prodigal in Lu Manor. Originally, he, Lu Chenxin and Sun Bajun were together known as the Three Bachelors of the Lu Family. It\u2019s a pity that Sun Bajun went missing after that.\u201cPity that Bajun\u2026\u201dAt the thought, Lu Chenxin grew heavy-hearted. \u201cMountain-Edge City is so prosperous and lively. If Brother Bajun was around, he would\u2019ve been delighted. Then we the Three Bachelors of the Lu Family would go drinking and cruise Cypress Pine Lake together. That\u2019d have been fun.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this. Where\u2019s Jiao Yan? Have you seen her?\u201d Lu Tianyang had recently been smitten by a servant girl in the family.\u201cShe\u2019s helping to tidy up the place. At Old Dad\u2019s carriage. You dare to go?\u201d Lu Chenxin pointed.Lu Tianyang stuck his tongue out without daring to reply.***Crystal Watergate, Mountain-Edge City.Swathes of grayish white flat-roof houses were packed tightly together like scales on a fish. In the middle, Cypress Pine Lake\u2014presently dyed a pinkish hue\u2014divided them into two districts.Lu Sheng and Chen Yunxi stood on the arched stone bridge above the watergate, admiring the willows by the lake, swaying in the wind. Neither of them spoke for a while.Seeing no response from the long-legged beauty before him, Lu Sheng smiled and broke the silence, \u201cI\u2019ve never been to this place. The air is fresh and scenery is beautiful. How did you think of this place for a stroll?\u201dChen Yunxi gazed at the opening of the watergate, from which water flowed incessantly like white silk, feeding into Cypress Pine Lake.\u201cMy Dad was the one who paid for the third refurbishment of this watergate. Lots of manpower and resources were involved. Once it was completed and water was let through, I came to watch. Back then, I was so excited.Gazing at how the murky brown flood water turned into clean water, clear as crystal, after flowing through the watergate\u2026 the impact that made on me\u2026 you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019ve seen similar sights in the past,\u201d Lu Sheng caressed his bald head, wondering why it took so long for new hair to grow.\u201cBrother Sheng. Tell me honestly. Do you despise me?\u201d Chen Yunxi turned around, staring at Lu Sheng with a pale face.\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful and virtuous, and come from such a decent family background. Who can despise you?\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head, \u201cI just don\u2019t want to settle down so soon.\u201dHe knew that the road ahead of him was destined to cross paths with the supernatural without end. His personality had decided that, since he possessed the Deep Blue Modifier, he would not live a mediocre life.And such a life was destined to be one that Chen Yunxi could not accept. What she desired was simply finding a good man, living the rest of her life in peace, bearing children to inherit the family business or achieve an academic degree.But these were not what Lu Sheng wanted.Since he was unable to give others a future, then he should not lead them on and hinder them.Lu Sheng understood this fact clearly. Hence, he made no effort to avoid Chen Yunxi when she approached after the ceremony, and came here with her.\u201cI know you\u2019re different from the rest of us,\u201d Chen Yunxi bowed her head, her voice trailing into a whisper. \u201cMy Dad also urged me not to be too persistent. From the changes on you, I can guess at the kind of life you used to lead.\u201d\u201cThen why do you still\u2026?\u201d Lu Sheng asked helplessly.\u201cBut, only when I\u2019m with you do I feel truly safe\u2026\u201d Chen Yunxi stepped closer to Lu Sheng.She was wearing a light, thin long-sleeved white dress. A cream-colored gauze cloak covered a pink top. A lotus leaf-shaped dress, tied with a butterfly knot to the right, covered her legs to her knees, revealing her perfect, fair and slender legs.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng stared in surprise at Chen Yunxi. Even in the open-minded Northern Lands, it was very rare for a woman to be so near a single male.\u201cI like you, Brother Sheng,\u201d Chen Yunxi gazed affectionately into Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes. \u201cEven though you\u2019ve lost your eyebrows, even though you\u2019ve become bald, even though your muscles are getting thicker and thicker, I still like you.\u201dLu Sheng felt weird. Something seemed wrong to him.\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Chen Yunxi stepped closer again, her bust lightly caressing his chest.\u201c\u2026marry me.\u201d\u201cPop.\u201dAn intricate jewelry box appeared in Chen Yunxi\u2019s hand out of nowhere. She gently opened it, revealing a white jade thumb ring within. A soaring phoenix had been carved on the ring.\u201c\u2026!\u201d exclamations burst forth in Lu Sheng\u2019s mind.Countless similar images flashed across his mind continuously. But all of those images were proposals by men to women. He had not expected in the slightest that a big beauty like Chen Yunxi would take such initiative to custom-make such an intricate white jade thumb ring to propose to him.Helpless, Lu Sheng regained his composure.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t give you the kind of life you want,\u201d lightly, he closed the jewelry box and pushed it back towards her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In that moment, he had really been slightly moved. However, as soon as he thought of the path that he had to take in the future, he hardened his heart.\u201cThere\u2019s no rush. You\u2019re still young, and will understand in the future that it\u2019s not a good thing for you to choose me,\u201d he turned away and spoke no more. \u201cI\u2019m heading back first. You think over it long and hard when you get back. Don\u2019t cause yourself to regret in the future,\u201d he waved his hand as he hastily left. If he had stayed any longer, there was no saying what other surprises Chen Yunxi would pull up.Clenching her teeth, Chen Yunxi closed back the box as she looked onto Lu Sheng\u2019s disappearing figure. At last, tears welled up in her eyes.She had already done all that she could, yet in the end it was still\u2026Lu Sheng\u2019s heart was troubled with complicated feelings the entire journey back, all the way till nighttime. A woman like Chen Yunxi was really the companion of his dreams in his previous life, but things were different now.Only after he had finished his meal did he gradually calm down. Returning to his room, he began to cultivate inner Qi.Ever since cultivating Crimson Heart Mantra and battling Gongsun, he had converted every ounce of Blood Fury Skill into Ultimate Crimson Mantra, and achieved the equivalent of Level Four Ultimate Crimson Qi.After restoring his body for so long and upgrading Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill to Level Four, it was about time to upgrade Ultimate Crimson Mantra.\u2018Deep Blue.\u2019Summoning the Modifier, Lu Sheng looked at the square frame before him.Blood Fury Skill was nowhere to be found. In its place was the fourth level of Ultimate Crimson Mantra.\u2018Ultimate Crimson Mantra: Level Four, Special Effect(s): Fire Poison, Tremor, Incendiary.\u2019\u2018Compared to Blood Fury Skill, there\u2019s the added special effect of Tremor, and it\u2019s only at the fourth level. A superior mantra, a first-rate inner force skill indeed!\u2019 Lu Sheng was inwardly satisfied. All of Blood Fury Skill\u2019s power had been expended, and in its place was Ultimate Crimson Mantra Level Four. Coincidentally, his injuries were fully recovered and his body restored into balance. It was time to upgrade to the next stage.\u2018Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill also needs to be cultivated. I\u2019ll first fully expend Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill before trying again tomorrow, and see if I\u2019m able to be initiated into this hard body skill,\u2019 armed with a plan, Lu Sheng\u2019s line of sight zoomed in on the Ultimate Crimson Mantra selection.He had stagnated at the Sprit Focus level for a very long time. Strength Proficiency, Intent Proficiency, Spirit Focus. Spirit Focus was also divided into low, middle and high calibers; for him to be able to beat the living daylights out of Gongsun Zhanglan, he was already in Pinnacle level in actuality.And beyond that was the peak that old Sect Master had mentioned, Divine Prime.To consolidate all the body\u2019s spirit and Qi, condensing them into one focused point, then tempering it till it has been cleaned of all impurities, retaining only its essence, then feeding it back into one\u2019s body\u2014that was the near mythical legend of the pugilistic world: Divine Prime.\u2018The Divine Prime level involves the very iffy and nebulous realm of one\u2019s spirit. Without head or tails about how to do so, I can only keep accumulating skills that are powerful enough. Strength in quantity can herald strength in quality. Even if I\u2019m not of the realm of Divine Prime, as long as my power reaches a certain extent, then even Divine Prime experts will not be my match!\u2019As he pressed onto the Modify button in his mind, the Modifier flashed.\u2018Upgrade Ultimate Crimson Mantra to Level Five,\u2019 Lu Sheng commanded inwardly.The Modifier trembled a little and blurred. When it came back into focus, Ultimate Crimson Mantra had transformed from Level Four into Level Five.A warm thread that was soft and sturdy at the same time orbited unhurriedly in Lu Sheng\u2019s chest. After circling for nine rounds, it suddenly gushed without warning into Lu Sheng\u2019s lower abdomen.\u201cHooo\u2026\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s entire body trembled as he felt the warm thread dispersing from his lower abdomen to all parts of his body.He looked at the Modifier again.\u2018Ultimate Crimson Mantra: Level Five, Special Effect(s): Intensified Fire Poison, Double Tremor, Intensified Incendiary\u2019.\u2018Success!\u2019 Lu Sheng then went on to feel for Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill, which had been wiped clean with not a drop left. He guessed that this amount was actually insufficient and had been made up for by his physical body.\u201cMy body feels a little weak and tired, probably because too much had been consumed. Cough, cough, cough\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng suddenly broke into a fit of coughs as his throat felt particularly sore.Rising hurriedly, he found a small chest in his clothes cupboard. He pulled out one of the drawers of the chest and retrieved from within a black jade bottle. He turned it over to pour out a round, purple pill, which he popped into his mouth.\u2018Hope this works,\u2019 this was a highly nourishing medicinal pill that had been concocted with the Blood Tree Flower as the main ingredient. After some mixing and matching, it was now a precious Yin-nourishing medicine.After taking the medicine, it was half a day before Lu Sheng felt the heatiness in his body soothing over slightly.\u2018The lung\u2019s Yin has been hurt, causing me to cough with the slightest irritation,\u2019 sighing, he knew that his body could not tolerate any more modification in the near future. He\u2019d have to wait it out before trying again.He lay back on his mattress to rest. After the time it took for a joss stick to burn, Lu Sheng finally opened his eyes. He heaved another long sigh.It had already been half a year since he had arrived on this world. In this time, he had not dared to delay in the least, but had focused all his energy into upgrading his skills and cultivation without any distractions. It was akin to walking on thin ice, with each step bridled with difficulty.He could be considered a big shot in the Sect now, and powerful when compared to the average mortal. However, when faced against the yet unknown supernatural world, he was still extremely fearful. That world was simply too dangerous. Any random thing thrown from that world would cause the ordinary man to tire from constantly fleeing for his life.That was not even considering other even stronger existences: ghosts, demons, devils and monsters, Noble Families, exorcists\u2026 each of them was unimaginably powerful and dangerous.If he hadn\u2019t had the Modifier on him, he could at the very most only arrive at Spirit Focus after a lifetime\u2019s hard work. Just like the old Sect Master.\u2018I\u2019ll try to initiate into Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill again tomorrow. Time waits for no man; this world is fraught with dangers. One more hard body skill\u2026 is one more asset to defend myself.\u2019Hard body skills for defense, outer force skills for attacks, and inner force skills as the core\u2014these were the three main directions that Lu Sheng had established for himself.\u2018Also, Ultimate Crimson Mantra\u2019s consumption is too outrageous. I should substantially upgrade Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill first for it to work.On the other hand, the effects of this Blood Tree Flower are quite exceptional, similar to the other prescriptions I took previously. And it\u2019s also much cheaper,\u2019 this month\u2019s salary, as well as the dividends from Wu San\u2019s assets from before, amounted to around thirty thousand taels of silver notes. Three doses of medicinal prescriptions were all it took to wipe them clean.As his training took a greater toll on him, coupled with the massive consumption needed to upgrade each level, the amount of nourishing herbs required also skyrocketed.The common prescriptions had zero effect on him. Their nourishing quality was too little. Only those herbs with very strong medicinal properties were of any good to the current Lu Sheng.These herbs did not come cheaply but were exorbitantly priced, resulting in his increasingly growing expenditure. One dose of the prescription was sufficient to last him only a couple of uses. If he didn\u2019t have inner Qi like the kind from Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill to nurse his body, then he could only wait patiently to recover from the injuries and side effects of rapid upgrades.After consuming the Blood Tree Flower medicinal pill, Lu Sheng once again looked within the Modifier. He examined in detail each of the skills under his belt, before finally shutting his eyes to rest.***In the abandoned village.In the deep of the night, Lu Chenxin was awoken by an urgent need to pee.He opened his eyes to pitch black. He looked towards the other two who were sharing the house with him, but it was so dark that he could not even see their shadows. Only the mild sounds of inhaling and exhaling could be heard faintly.It was deathly silent outside the house. Lu Chenxin rolled around on the mattress that was placed on the ground, curling up into a fetal position.\u2018I really drank too much in the day. Tsk, should have known better than to drink excessively with that chap, Tianyang,\u2019 he was still overcome with drowsiness and wished to continue sleeping on. However, the swelling in his small abdomen was getting unbearable, to the extent that he almost peed in his pants.\u201cTianyang? Brother Song?\u201d He called out towards the other two in the room.Not a sound or movement came from either of them. They were very soundly asleep.\u2018Forget it, your grandpa will go himself,\u2019 he muttered under his breath. He found his waistband, gently pulled on the door and swiftly went outside.Outside was the picture of gloom in the deep of the night. Only the faint moonlight that shone through the clouds provided some hazy sense of direction.\u2018What crap is this\u2026 everyone\u2019s sleeping so soundly.\u2019Left without other choice, Lu Chenxin exited the mud-house. He looked to both sides, which were flanked by dark, empty grasslands and deep forests. Not a soul could be seen anywhere in the dark.\u2018Come to think of it, given how secluded this abandoned village is, it\u2019d be stranger if there were actually people staying here. This won\u2019t do, I\u2019d better settle my business and then head back to sleep.\u2019Lu Chenxin was inwardly rather afraid. Hastily glancing to the left and right, he walked towards the corner of the wall by the side of the mud-house.He had chosen a house with no-one inside. Stooping down in the crack between the walls of two adjacent mud-houses, he quickly removed his robes and waistband.\u201cHoo\u2026\u201dWind blew incessantly through the cracks in the two facing walls, causing Lu Chenxin to feel a chill on his buttocks. After stooping for a while, he could not shake off the sensation that someone was behind him.\u201cHOO!\u201dHe swung around violently. Behind him was that pitch-black patch of grassland that led straight into the mountain. [1]\u2018I\u2019d better finish my business and head back to rest!\u2019Turning back again, he hurriedly began to exert all his strength.The entire process spanned the time needed for a joss stick to thoroughly burn out. Only then did he slowly rise and massage his buttocks. He began to reattach his waistband.After putting it on, he arranged his robes and then decided to return to his mud-house.\u201cSwish\u2026\u201dOut of the blue, the crisp sound of pouring water could be heard from the middle of the village.Lu Chenxin was slightly alarmed.In the deathly silence in the middle of the night, the sound of water was especially stark in the deserted village.\u201cWho could be fetching water to drink at this ungodly hour? The water is unbearably chilly in the night. Not to mention, the well water would be even icier,\u201d Lu Chenxin mumbled. He walked out of the crack in the wall and looked towards the well in the middle of the village, his curiosity piqued.From afar, he could see a man, black as ink, stand by the wall as he poured water out of a bucket back into it.\u2018This person\u2026 was there anyone in our group who wore black?\u2019 Even from a distance, Lu Chenxin could sense that this person looked extremely familiar from his back, although he could not place where exactly he had seen this person before.\u2018Could it be Uncle Zhao? No, Uncle Zhao\u2019s not that skinny.Or is that Sixth Uncle? But Sixth Uncle isn\u2019t that tall.\u2019Lu Chenxin found it rather strange. Looking to the left and right, he couldn\u2019t see anyone else around.\u201cSzz\u2026 szz\u2026 szz\u2026\u201dThat person once again began to lower the bucket into the well.Lu Chenxin was growing more and more curious. Thinking it over, he still decided to head over to check out who it was that couldn\u2019t get to sleep but was out here drawing water.With that thought in mind, he walked slowly in the direction of the well.After walking in this manner for barely a few steps, he saw that the person once again pulled up a bucket of water. After which\u2026\u201cSwish\u2026 \u201dThat person actually emptied the bucket of water back into the well.\u201cHEY!\u201d Lu Chenxin couldn\u2019t stop himself from calling out. \u201cIt\u2019s in the middle of the night, what are you doing here drawing water and then pouring it back in? Haven\u2019t you anything else better to do?\u201dHe quickened his pace.That person did not give the slightest response, almost as if his words had fallen entirely onto deaf ears. Once again, he hung the bucket and gradually lowered it.Lu Chenxin approached, resentment rising in him. Why didn\u2019t this guy turn around when he was being spoken to?But as he drew nearer and nearer, he began to feel as if something was amiss.The silhouette by the well wore a set of black, tattered long robes. His extremely long hair was an eyesore as it fell messily down his back.Most importantly, his back view was unlike anyone he could remember and was absolutely foreign. Yet, he could not shake off the familiar feeling he had in his subconsciousness. It was very apparent that he could not recall from his memory where he had seen it, but he couldn\u2019t help but find it familiar.\u2018What\u2019s happening? I\u2026\u2019 Lu Chenxin could feel goosebumps rising on his skin.He tried hard to direct both his legs to stop advancing forwards, but his curiosity got the better of him; he just had to go and see this person face-to-face to find out who exactly it was that was drawing water in the dead night.\u201cSzzz\u2026 \u201dYet another pail of water swung upwards.Lu Chenxin drew nearer and nearer, but a strange sense of alarm began to surface in the deep recesses of his heart. His heart began to pound wildly, but his legs continued to act of their own accord, leading him slowly but surely towards that person.\u201cYou\u2026 just who\u2026\u201d\u201cCHI!\u201dA small fire had been ignited, which lit up the room in pale yellow light.\u201cChenxin? Chenxin?\u201dInside the mud house, Lu Tianyang slowly put down the flint stone in his hands. Borrowing the light of the oil lamp, he looked around in the interior. The sky had just begun to lighten, yet Lu Chenxin was actually nowhere to be found.\u201cWhere has this lad run off to? Don\u2019t tell me he snuck off to fool around with Xiuxiu?\u201d He rubbed his eyes and yawned slowly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Young Master Chenxin\u2019s not here?\u201d Brother Song, who was on the other side, took a long, deep stretch. He sat up.\u201cDidn\u2019t see him since early this morning. Wonder where he\u2019s run off to,\u201d Lu Tianyang muttered quietly. \u201cPerhaps he snuck out to meet privately with some woman,\u201d he flashed a smile universally understood by all men as he said that.Brother Song chuckled along with him. The two of them quickly got out of bed, tidied up, and then walked out of the house.Some of the rest had also arisen. Lu Quanan stood by the side of the ox-cart, commanding two soldiers beside to help to carry some things.\u201cYou\u2019re here. Where\u2019s Chenxin? Where\u2019s that lad run off to?\u201d Lu Quanan looked at Lu Tianyang with a frown on his face.\u201cEr\u2026 he should be outside here somewhere. I haven\u2019t seen him since I got up,\u201d Lu Tianyang answered, rubbing his head in bewilderment.\u201cDongzi! Little Lin! Where are they? Where have they disappeared to!?\u201d Brother Song, standing to the side, hollered furiously. His expression was ugly as he stood guard over the bonfire, which had been thoroughly extinguished.\u201cI asked those two monkeys to keep watch in the night\u2014instead, the fire has completely gone out. There aren\u2019t even any embers left! These two bastards!\u201d Incensed, Brother Song lashed out fiercely.The guards all looked at each other in dismay. Although silent, they all tacitly determined to find the two who were on sentry\u2014Dong\u2019zi and Little Lin.\u201cWho has seen Little Lin?\u201d Brother Song asked severely.The crowd shook their heads.\u201cHaven\u2019t seen him this morning, perhaps he went to take a wee-wee?\u201d Someone replied laughingly.\u201cNONSENSE!\u201d Brother Song looked to the Lu family dependents by the side, his face distorted. They were all city guards, and these were the family of the Second-in-Command of the city garrison. If word were to reach his ears\u2026\u201cFind him! Don\u2019t dilly-dally!\u201d He barked.Over at Lu Quanan\u2019s side, he also went about searching for a while, but to no avail. There was no sign to be seen anywhere. He began to grow anxious. No matter what sort of scoundrel Lu Chenxin was, he was still his son after all.Both sides began their search for the missing persons. There was no response at all; three living, breathing men had actually disappeared with nary a trace.Disquiet grew in Lu Tianyang\u2019s heart. Discretely, he approached Zhang Xiuxiu.\u201cXiu Xiu, did Chenxin go to find you yesterday night?\u201d\u201cNope. I slept very soundly through the night, and didn\u2019t wake at all,\u201d Zhang Xiuxiu was also beginning to feel that something wasn\u2019t right. Her face was slightly pale.Lu Tianyang panicked. He looked around at the large crowd of people shouting at all directions, frantically searching, but to no avail. Not a sound could be heard in response.Beads of perspiration could be seen on Lu Quanan\u2019s forehead. He arranged men to search high and low in all directions, looking into all nooks and crannies, but they still came up empty-handed.\u201cOld Master, we can\u2019t find them!\u201d Brother Song soon received news from his underlings, which he swiftly reported back to Lu Quanan.\u201cCan\u2019t find them\u2026\u201d Lu Quanan\u2019s gaze swept across his surroundings. Somehow, he felt that as if a cloak of eeriness covered the little village.\u201cIt\u2019s no good. It\u2019s too risky to stay here! We need to leave quickly.\u201d\u201cBut those three who went missing\u2026\u201d Second Mother Liu Cuiyu was worried.\u201cWe\u2019ll leave first, and then send a search party back here. We can\u2019t all stay here now!\u201d A trace of urgency could be heard in Lu Quanan\u2019s tone. This world was filled with all sorts of dangers; he couldn\u2019t put all his eggs in one basket.\u201cOld Master, we haven\u2019t found Chenxin, we can\u2019t leave yet!\u201d Third mother Wang Yanyu protested anxiously.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m leaving. I intend to shift everyone to a place of safety first, then come back to search. We\u2019ll leave behind a sign for Little Three, so he\u2019ll know where we are,\u201d Lu Quanan replied with a straight face. He also couldn\u2019t bear to leave his third son, but the situation was looking very dire. The two soldiers on sentry were no average Joe; both were hulking, strong men. Yet, they had disappeared without any sound.This was not an ordinary occurrence.He suspected that he and his men had been swept up into some sort of trouble.\u201cOld Master!\u201d Wang Yanyu pleaded.\u201cWe must leave! Now!\u201d Lu Quanan ordered resolutely.Under the command of Brother Song and him, the crowd swiftly gathered back into formation. Pulling along the ox carts and horse carts, they left the abandoned village at a steady pace.Lu Quanan specially left behind a horse and some food and water for Lu Chenxin and the two soldiers, which he placed next to the well in the middle of the village. That was the most eye-catching location; anyone who entered the village would see it at first glance.To be lost in this deserted wilderness\u2026 actually, Lu Quanan knew deep down that everything bode ill for the three of them\u2026After all, the three of them could not have traveled far in such wilderness. And if they hadn\u2019t traveled far, and yet failed to surface at the frantic calls of so many people\u2026 he feared that they had really come into harm\u2019s way.Although his heart bled in pain, he had the duty to care for everyone under his charge, and couldn\u2019t risk the majority\u2019s welfare at this juncture.***At the Crimson Whale.Inside the spacious meeting hall, the old Sect Master, Chen Ying, a few other External and Internal Affairs Emissaries, as well as Lu Sheng, were all gathered together.First thing that morning, the old Sect Master had dispatched people to inform all the high-ranks of the sect to gather for a meeting.No one in the group had any inkling about what was going on. After scurrying over, each of them waited at their seats.Lu Sheng sat at the sixth External Affairs Emissaries seat, which had previously belonged to Wu San.Cool rays of the sun shone in from the side of the big hall. It passed through the stained glass windows, reflecting all sorts of colorfully distorted images on the ground.Servant girls scampered around, serving piping hot tea and cakes before retreating.The old Sect Master\u2019s gaze was dignified and commanded respect from all present. He scanned over the group.\u201cAlright, those who have no business here, leave,\u201d he signaled with his hand.All the servant-girls promptly obeyed and withdrew from the big hall. Only Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s high-ranks remained.The main doors slowly shut tight with a dull \u2018BAM\u2019, closing completely. The atmosphere in the main hall seemed to grow heavier with each second ticking by. Everyone present could tell that something was off in the old Sect Master\u2019s expression.\u201cJust what has happened?\u201d Frowning, Chen Ying took the initiative to ask.\u201cSect Master, has there been developments in the North?\u201d Another External Affairs Emissary asked.\u201cNo, it\u2019s one of the areas under our purview. There\u2019s been a problem,\u201d the old Sect Master\u2019s voice was tense. Gingerly, he retrieved from within his sleeves a silver-colored letter. This letter was very unique; it was actually not made from paper, but a bizarre silver-colored gold.\u201cEveryone here knows who stands behind Crimson Whale Sect. This time, the information was transmitted precisely by them,\u201d Hong Mingzi\u2019s voice was not loud, but the message it contained caused the hearts of all those present to tremble.\u201cThis information was transmitted by them?\u201d Unaware of it himself, Chen Ying\u2019s large hands had gripped tightly onto the handles of his chair. \u201cThey sent out news once ten years ago, which resulted in the deaths of over a thousand in our Sect. And there\u2019s news again this time\u2026\u201d his face turned ugly.Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes narrowed into a slit.\u201cThe Noble Family\u2014Zhen Family,\u201d the old Sect Master Hong Mingzi replied.\u2018Noble Family\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng was thoroughly shaken. Indeed\u2026Everyone else grew solemn. As for the term \u2018Noble Family\u2019, only those of such high rank like them would understand its implications.Heavy faces could be seen on all the people present.\u201cThe Zhen Family members usually hardly make an appearance. Once they do, it means the situation has come to a head. Don\u2019t tell me that now\u2026\u201d Elder Wang said gravely.\u201cThe situation now is indeed in an extremely bad shape,\u201d Hong Mingzi replied soberly. \u201cI\u2019ve only just received the news. In just one night, in the entire Northern lands from the Xichuan Manor to the Donglin Manor, as long as it\u2019s within our Crimson Whale Sect jurisdiction\u2014in just one night, eight forbidden zones have sprung up!\u201d\u201cEIGHT FORBIDDEN ZONES???\u201d Chen Ying\u2019s eyes bulged in surprise. Unable to contain his shock, he had involuntarily stood up.It wasn\u2019t just him. The others were also in an uproar.What was a forbidden zone? The Song Manor that left Lu Sheng wounded previously was one of them; in fact, it was considered a rudimentary forbidden zone that had been just formed. The Northern lands, in its entirety, were such a vast area that originally already had quite a few forbidden zones. Now, eight more forbidden zones had sprung up all of a sudden. This meant that on any day, someone could easily take a wrong route and accidentally enter a forbidden zone.By the time the person realized and tried to escape, it would depend on the person\u2019s luck. If his luck were bad, then there wasn\u2019t even any way of knowing how he would die.Lu Sheng also understood the gravity of the situation. His posture was tense as he listened intently to what the old Sect Master continued to share with them.\u201cThe Zhen Family views this as a severe provocation towards them, and thus has sent out specialists to settle the matter,\u201d Hong Mingzi explained briefly. \u201cThe Nobleman representative they have dispatched to look into the matter is surnamed Zhen, first name Xun. He asks that we deal adequately with the aftermath of the new eight forbidden areas\u2019 appearance. He seeks our full cooperation to ensure that there will be no widespread panic.\u201d\u201cJust he alone would be able to settle it?\u201d Chen Ying asked doubtfully.\u201cThere\u2019s indeed just this Young Master Zhen Xun from the Zhen Family who was sent here. However, according to how it\u2019s usually done, this Young Master Zhen Xun should be the one in-charge, but there will be others dispatched under him. Otherwise, with so many places to cover, merely running to and fro each location would take up quite a massive amount of time,\u201d Hong Mingzi replied. \u201cHere are the details on the eight forbidden zones\u2014everyone, take a look.\u201dHe handed over the letter to Chen Ying, who scanned through it and passed it over to the next person. This cycle repeated itself.Very soon, the letter landed in Lu Sheng\u2019s hands. He unfurled it gently.On the letter was a map of a greater part of the Northern lands. On it, eight small red dots had been distinctly indicated.He was looking through it when suddenly, his eyes focused on one particular red dot.\u201cThere\u2019s also a forbidden zone between Nine Links City and Mountain-Edge City?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cYes,\u201d the old Sect Master Hong Mingzi nodded. \u201cJunior Apprentice Brother, you best inform your family to make a detour around that place.\u201dLu Sheng was somber as he nodded.This was the first time that he officially got into contact with a Nobleman\u2014excluding Duanmu Wan. Just what sort of difference existed between them, the average person, and the martial arts practitioners? He wasn\u2019t sure.Perhaps, he would be able to identify the crux of the matter this time.After making the situation clear, the old Sect Master promptly assigned the individuals responsible for managing the aftermath around specific forbidden zones.Lu Sheng likewise was assigned a mission. Probably out of consideration for him, he was deployed to that forbidden zone between Nine Links City and Mountain-Edge City.After they dispersed from the meeting, Lu Sheng swiftly chose his men and horses. There was a total of twenty men, making it twenty-one including him. Five of them were Strength Proficiency experts of the Soaring Eagle Squad, while the rest were all strong, elite saber masters. Twenty men on twenty horses made a dash for the location at full speed.He wanted to see how exactly were the Noblemen different from the average people.The horses ran at full pelt without making any rest stops. By the time it was almost noon, Lu Sheng had finally arrived at the forbidden zone.***In the abandoned village.After Lu Quanan\u2019s entourage left steadily, it was nearly noontime when the village by the main road again received another guest.Under the gloomy gray sky, a perfectly black horse trotted unhurriedly into the little village.On top of the horse sat a young, smiling Young Master of a mild disposition.\u201cIs this the place?\u201d The smile was plastered on the Young Master\u2019s face, almost as if it were frozen. It was consistently the same smile.He was dressed in green robes and entirely unarmed, with nary a piece of metal to be found on his body. With only a piece of dark green jade hanging from his waistband, he looked entirely plain and simple.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Haven\u2019t you been trying to draw us out?\u201d His voice rang out as he surveyed his surroundings.\u201cNow, I\u2019ve come.\u201dAs his voice fell, a figure appeared in front of the old well in the middle of the village.It was a person clad in black robes, with long unkempt hair falling all over its shoulders, its arms hanging limply by its side.The figure\u2019s head was bowed, preventing a clear view of its face. It simply stood facing the Young Master. Aside, the horse Lu Quanan had left behind had vanished into thin air. Only a bag of rations lay beside the well.\u201cWe\u2019ve long laid down an agreement not to cross over into each other\u2019s affairs. What\u2019s the meaning behind your attacks?\u201d The Young Master demanded coldly.\u201cSWISH!\u201dAll that came in reply was an iron ax shooting towards him, heading straight for his flank.Spinning rapidly, the ax split the air apart, producing the sharp sound of friction against the air. Then, lightning-quick, it slashed right across the Young Master\u2019s temple.\u201cCHI.\u201dBlood splattered into the air.The Young Master\u2019s brains were split open by the ax. A finger-deep gash appeared on his head. He stood still on his spot without a flinch.\u201cIs that an attempt at intimidation?\u201d Shockingly, the Young Master remained staring at the strange figure before him, emotionless. The palm-length wound on his head began to close up and heal rapidly on its own, just like the closing of a flower that had just blossomed. In a matter of seconds, the wound on his temple had vanished without a trace, as if no injury had been there before.The ax fell to the ground on the side, dust and mud sticking to it. Peculiarly, not a drop of blood stuck to its head. [ED/N: An ax\u2019s head is its metal part\u2014as opposed to its wooden shaft]The Young Master\u2019s face was composed as he strode towards the figure at the well.About half a mile\u2019s distance away from the village, along the mountain path\u2026Leading twenty of his subordinates on horses, Lu Sheng stood silently on the winding mountain path, peering towards the direction of the village.Presently, he was halfway up the mountain and could see the plateau on which the deserted village sat. For the ordinary person, perhaps the distance would have been too far for clear sight. But Lu Sheng was different.He gazed intently at the Young Master at the mouth of the village. He, too, had witnessed that bizarre scene.\u2018His brain was hacked in two and yet he could recover. Is he even human\u2026?\u2019 his brows locked together into a tight knot, frustration rising in his heart.He had seen ghosts and even Anomalies. But this was the first time he had seen a Nobleman in action. It was completely different from what he had expected.\u2018Or perhaps that isn\u2019t a Nobleman? Maybe that young man is also a supernatural being that\u2019s part of the forbidden grounds\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng surmised. Yet, right before his departure, old Sect Master had taken special effort to remind him that if he were to see a smiley young man dressed in green walk alone into a forbidden zone as if it were nothing, that must be someone from the Zhen Family.\u2018Are all from the Zhen Family that bizarre?\u2019 Lu Sheng\u2019s brows scrunched up further.Atop his horse, one hand gripped onto his saber hilt while the other held onto the reins.\u2018Noble Families are the only existence that can battle supernatural beings\u2026 that\u2019s what Duanmu Wan told me. So what makes them powerful enough to resist such mighty beings?\u2019 Lu Sheng was reminded of Duanmu Wan as well as Daoist Yan Kai, whom he suspected was also a Nobleman. But he could not tell what extraordinarily powerful methods or skills they had.Yan Kai, for example, merely relied on his own blood to kill ghosts. His performance back then in the temple was not even as impressive as what Lu Sheng was presently capable of.\u201cAren\u2019t we going over, External Head?\u201d Someone from Soaring Eagle Squad asked softly. Their ocular powers could not hold a candle to that of Lu Sheng and thus they were unable to see what was going on in the village. Needless to say, they had no idea why Lu Sheng had stopped in the middle of the road.Lu Sheng stared at the Young Master who was entering the village until the mud houses hid him from view. Only then did he take a deep breath.\u201cLet\u2019s go take a look.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dThe company of men slowly went down the mountain, drawing closer to the deserted village.They had traveled using a shortcut and so were much faster than ordinary travelers. However, this shortcut was very narrow. Only experts with good hand-eye coordination dared to walk that route by the cliff.Following the mountain path, they descended the mountain. Lu Sheng brought the men to the mouth of the village without entering it. They all alighted from their horses.\u201cPssst\u2026\u201dThe horses seemed uneasy, breathing out heavily, trying to turn around and get away from this place. But the men held them tight by the reins and tied them to a thick tree by the path.Apart from Lu Sheng, the rest of them actually had no idea what kind of mission they were here to accomplish. All they knew was that it was Lu Sheng\u2019s orders and that this mission carried some danger and needed caution.\u201cAre we going in?\u201d The Soaring Eagle Squad\u2019s leading expert, Duan Hongying, asked Lu Sheng.\u201cNo hurry. Someone\u2019s already inside. We just need to wait outside and lock down this area. Don\u2019t let anyone enter or exit,\u201d Lu Sheng instructed.\u201cUnderstood!\u201d They dispersed, setting up sentries all around the village.The twenty of them spread themselves apart and surrounded the village, each remaining within sight of the other.Lu Sheng fell into a moment of thought as he stood outside the village, listening intently for the commotion within.Some people seemed to be battling in one of the mud houses. Though not much noise reached outside, it was clearly discernible to him.\u2018Noble Families\u2026 what kind of power do they possess\u2026?\u2019 Lu Sheng was gripped by curiosity.In reality, he was now the number one expert of Crimson Whale Sect. Even if the old Sect Master were to fight against him with his life, Lu Sheng would still emerge the victor.Including the ghosts that he had previously encountered, Lu Sheng had honestly never run into mortal danger. Hence, a compelling urge arose within Lu Sheng to figure out where he stood in the eyes of the Noblemen.Gripping his saber hilt tightly, Lu Sheng stalked into the village.\u2018The sounds are coming from that largest mud house on the right.\u2019Having confirmed the direction, he skulked towards the mud house.Walking up to the window, his breath thickened as he peered in through it.It was pitch black within. Nothing could be seen.Lu Sheng frowned and pressed himself nearer the window in an attempt to get a better look.\u201cWhat are you looking at? Can you tell me?\u201dWithout warning, a gentle voice rang out from behind him.Lu Sheng jolted in shock and spun round immediately, almost unsheathing his saber in a slash.\u201cYou!!!?\u201d Lu Sheng hastily retreated two steps before realizing that the man who had suddenly popped up behind him was the green-robed Young Master who had entered the village earlier.His face was carrying a peaceable smile as he had stood silently and unarmed behind Lu Sheng.The distance between them was hardly two-meter wide.\u201cWho are you?!\u201d Lu Sheng growled. The other party was actually capable of stealing up on him undetected; he had never seen such movement skill before.\u201cMe?\u201d The Young Master\u2019s smile did not fade in the slightest as he replied, \u201cI\u2019m Zhen Yi. You\u2019re from Crimson Whale Sect, here to handle the aftermath, right? There\u2019re no longer any ghosts here. But it needs to be closed off for ten days. No living being must enter this place.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s Young Master Zhen. You said \u2018no living being\u2019?\u201d Lu Sheng quickly bowed respectfully.\u201cYou may understand it as \u2018no human being\u2019,\u201d Zhen Yi smiled.\u201cGot it,\u201d Lu Sheng nodded.\u201cGood,\u201d Zhen Yi smiled and nodded. \u201cHandle this place then. Remember: after I leave, no one is to enter.\u201d\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Lu Sheng bowed.\u201cOh, and next time, tell Hong Mingzi not be so brash\u2026\u201d Zhen Yi pushed himself upright with his hand on the windowsill. Then, he turned around and strode off in the distance.Lu Sheng\u2019s head remained bowed until he was thoroughly gone and disappeared from sight. Only then did he slowly raise his head.Turning around again, he saw a clearly discernible black palm print on the window sill.A complicated look flashed across his face. Gently, he reached out and touched the palm print with his finger.\u201cSzzzzzz\u2026\u201dA shocking, intense pain stabbed his finger and drove into his heart, rapidly spreading all over his body like a virus.Lu Sheng watched as the flesh on his index finger swiftly turned black, then withered as if poisoned or doused with strong acid. The flesh quickly shriveled like a deflated balloon.\u201cCHI!\u201dResolutely, he quickly cut off the flesh on his fingertip without regret.The lump of black flesh fell on the ground and quickly dissolved into black smoke. All of Lu Sheng\u2019s inner Qi gushed towards his finger madly, continuing to resist the remnant black flesh.\u201cWhat terrible poison\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng sucked in a cold breath of air. His forehead was drenched in beads of cold sweat, induced by the intense pain, and veins popped up prominently on his neck. He scrutinized the black areas on his finger. After consuming a massive amount of inner Qi, the blackness finally faded away gradually.A spot of black flesh, the size of a sesame, took a whole eighty percent of his inner Qi, comprised of both Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill and Ultimate Crimson Mantra, to suppress. And, it was barely suppressed at that.Lu Sheng lifted his saber and carefully gouged out this part of his finger too.Despite the pain stabbing right into his heart, he endured the intense agony and finished the job.\u2018Noblemen\u2026 is the gap between us really that vast?\u2019His heart grew heavy. He looked at the black palm print on the windowsill again.\u2018I should no longer stay in this place,\u2019 hastily, Lu Sheng turn around, intending to leave immediately.All of a sudden, a package on the rim of the well caught his eyes. It was a dark-red bundle with a giant word \u201cLu\u201d embroidered on it.\u2018It\u2019s the cloth used exclusively by my family!\u2019 Lu Sheng\u2019s heart shook. Hurriedly, he strode over, picked up the bundle and opened it gingerly.Some rations and a letter were in it. Without hesitating, Lu Sheng ripped open the letter.It was left for Lu Chenxin, detailing the directions towards Mountain-Edge City as well as the signs they would leave behind along the way.\u2018It\u2019s a letter left for Lu Chenxin. That means my family was here in this village, and Lu Chenxin went missing,\u201d Lu Sheng quickly analyzed what had happened. \u2018Thankfully, no major accidents happened to them. Lu Chenxin wasn\u2019t a decent chap to begin with. His life or death isn\u2019t of my concern.\u2019 But his thoughts took a turn, \u2018I remember when I first made the trip to Mountain-Edge City, there wasn\u2019t any village here. Why didn\u2019t any mishaps occur here until my family was on the way and passed by?\u2019He exited the village. Zhen Yi was no longer to be found. Only Crimson Whale Sect experts were to be seen, standing guard around the village.Lu Sheng hid the wound on his finger in his sleeves.\u201cGuard this place closely. Forbid anyone from entering. Two of you, go back and arrange for reinforcements who will take shifts with you to come!\u201dHe began deploying the men. Just these twenty men were definitely inadequate to lock down this place; more men were necessary.\u201cYes, sir!\u201dAfter relaying his instructions, Lu Sheng rushed back towards Mountain-Edge City without pause.His family was currently in the midst of relocating. Should any trouble happen to them along the way or should they enter other forbidden zones, they would be deep in trouble. He needed to check on them.His gut instincts told him that this accident was no mere coincidence.Riding at full pelt, Lu Sheng kept going along the main path. Time gradually passed and dusk began to fall.He had pursued them for a long time and his horse was beginning to run out of steam.At the same time, Lu Family\u2019s carriage team was gradually emerging in Lu Sheng\u2019s field of vision along the main path. They seemed to be in disarray.Lu Sheng heaved a sigh of relief. Shaking the reins, he sped up towards them. Yet, before needing to draw near to them, he could see that a giant red lantern hung from one of the horse carriages.The red lantern hung from the entrance of the carriage. Moreover, through the window, two more red lanterns that looked exactly the same could be seen inside the carriage.Instantly, Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze was trained on them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only when he saw that some in the entourage had caught sight of him did he slowly approach.As he neared, Lu Quanan hurriedly led a group of men out to welcome him.\u201cSheng\u2019er! Why have you come? Your hair?\u201d Seeing Lu Sheng\u2019s current appearance, he was stumped.Lu Sheng flipped himself off the horse.\u201cIt\u2019s a long story, let\u2019s not talk about the hair first. Dad, Second Mother, Uncle Zhao, I came from Mountain-Edge City. Why have you stopped here? Also, who hung up those red lanterns?\u201dHe pointed at the red lanterns that hung on the horse carriages in a seemingly flippant manner.\u201cNo idea, we\u2019re checking it out now. Previously, they were the ordinary yellow hide lanterns. It was only when we were on our way that someone abruptly noticed that the lanterns had actually been switched,\u201d Lu Quanan explained seriously, hints of worry and anxiety clearly seen on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s a good timing that you\u2019re here, Sheng\u2019er, help us take a look.\u201dLu Sheng looked around at the people nearby. Everyone from back home was here; Second Mother, Third Mother, Uncle Zhao, as well as Fourth Mother, Fifth Mother and Little Aunt, who were scurrying over from afar. Other than those from his household, there was also a large number of extended relatives and distant family members, including his biological mother\u2019s household, as well as a few other related ones. Just those from the Lu Family alone numbered more than twenty.\u201cBrother Sheng, thank goodness you\u2019re here. Chenxin has disappeared; you must help me search for him, you must find him!\u201d Third Mother was Lu Chenxin\u2019s biological mother, Wang Yanyu. Presently, her face was ashen and her eyes swollen red. Clearly, she had been crying.\u201cDon\u2019t worry Third Mother, I\u2019ll try my best,\u201d Lu Sheng nodded.Although his family was shocked by his present looks, they did not pay it much attention in this crucial time. Now that Lu Sheng had come, they felt much safer.Previously in Nine Links City, it was Brother Sheng who had settled the matter. Now, Brother Sheng would also definitely have a way out. Everyone looked at him with looks of anticipation and trust.Lu Sheng headed straight for the carriage team, standing next to the horse carriage that was now vacated. Quite a number of soldiers stood by the side; one of them, a slightly rotund, dark-skinned man was staring fixedly at the carriage in trepidation. He clutched onto his waist-blade, eyes fixed on the horse carriage.\u201cSo it\u2019s Brother Sheng! You\u2019ve come! That\u2019s good news for us. Here, take a look: the scratch on the original lantern is still here, and the words on it are one and the same,\u201d this fatso was none other than Brother Song. His mood was already dour after having lost three brothers. Now this had to crop up.Lu Sheng nodded as he examined the red lanterns hanging at the carriage in detail.\u201cWho sat in this carriage previously?\u201d He asked in a low tone.\u201cIt was Third Young Master Lu Chenxin and Fourth Young Master Lu Tianyang, as well as Zhang Xiuxiu\u2019s family,\u201d Brother Song swiftly replied in a whisper.\u201cWhen did Chenxin go missing?\u201d The more Lu Sheng looked at this lantern, the more it seemed like the type he saw on the pleasure boats from before.\u201cHe was missing from way back in the abandoned village,\u201d Brother Song quickly answered.\u201cAbandoned village\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze swept across the surroundings. His eyes gradually grew cold with understanding. \u201cContinue forward towards Mountain-Edge City and don\u2019t make any stops. I want to see for myself just which trifling deity dares to mess with my Lu Family,\u201d he called out in his old Dad\u2019s direction.Lu Quanan nodded back at him vigorously.\u201cGo! Everyone get on board, and take those red lanterns down. Continue ahead!\u201d\u201cWait! Leave this carriage behind, let\u2019s not use it anymore,\u201d Lu Sheng held back Zhang Xiuxiu\u2019s family and Lu Tianyang, who were about to board it.Their faces turned pale. Clearly, they all understood that these red lanterns were probably a sign of some trouble.\u201cBig Bro, will anything happen to us\u2026\u201d Lu Tianyang shuffled over to Lu Sheng\u2019s side and asked.\u201cNot if you listen to my instructions,\u201d Lu Sheng glared at him.He had never held the Three Bachelors of the Lu Family in high regard. He was already showing him face by responding.Lu Tianyang boarded the carriage sulking.The carriage team once again continued on their way. However, each and every one of them was on high alert, keeping a close eye out for the surroundings and the road.The carriage wheels rolled on in a lull, producing dull sounds of friction as they crashed against the uneven path.Lu Sheng paid close attention to the surroundings and all that was happening.As they moved along, he suddenly felt something amiss.\u201cSTOP!!!\u201d He raised his hand abruptly.Swiftly following suit, Lu Quanan gestured for all to come to a stop.Lu Sheng gradually turned his head. That abandoned horse carriage with the red lanterns was actually still closely following behind the carriage team. The bright-red lanterns were extremely eye-catching, though the horses did not make a single sound. It was as if there was still a coachman guiding them.Very soon, the rest of the people also noticed this strange phenomenon. A sudden fearful scream from one of them pierced the air, but it was immediately stifled. Someone reprimanded that person.An atmosphere of alarm and panic slowly washed over the entire entourage.\u201cWhat are you scared of!\u201d Lu Sheng scoffed coldly. \u201cTie this carriage to that big tree by the side. We\u2019ll continue on our way. I reckon this old horse is familiar with humans and won\u2019t leave us alone.\u201d\u201cYes, there are indeed such occurrences. I\u2019ve seen such things happen before in the pugilistic world,\u201d Uncle Zhao quickly explained with a smile.The soldiers were rather afraid, but under Brother Song\u2019s chiding, they stepped forward to tie that horse carriage with red lanterns to an old withered tree by the side.The carriage team trudged on and continued forward.They proceeded for about the time it takes for tealeaves to seep. This time, everyone glanced back incessantly, fearful that the carriage would still be trailing behind them.Clearly, the previous scene had scared them out of their wits.After travelling for about an hour, they gradually let their guards down.\u201cLook in front!\u201d Suddenly, a soldier yelled.Immediately, everyone looked forward.On the left of the main path before them, the carriage, which they had tied up earlier, stood still and silent.Light still glowed quietly from the red lanterns hanging off the carriage.Subconsciously, the entire carriage team came to a halt. Everyone\u2019s breathing paused as they stared dumbstruck at the carriage with red lanterns.Lu Quanan took out his handkerchief and wiped the cold sweat off his face. Though he too looked frightened, he fought hard to retain his composure in order to assure those around him who were falling into panic.Lu Sheng glared at the horse carriage coldly.\u201cClang!\u201d He unsheathed his saber and strode towards the horse carriage with red lanterns.\u201cAll of you leave first. I\u2019ll catch up with you!\u201d\u201cSheng\u2019er!\u201d Lu Quanan called out. \u201cBe careful!\u201d\u201cMm,\u201d without even a turn of his head, Lu Sheng waved his hand at them, signaling them to leave immediately. He stayed behind alone, his gaze never once leaving the horse carriage.With the sound of turning wheels, the carriage team left, leaving the unflinching Lu Sheng standing still on the main path.He licked his lips, held onto his saber and slowly walked towards the carriage.\u201cAren\u2019t you looking for me? I\u2019ve come. Right here,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cAren\u2019t you seeking revenge for that female ghost aboard the pleasure boat?Tsk tsk tsk\u2026 a pity. You didn\u2019t get to see how I skinned her alive. Then I gouged out her eyes, and cut off her nose and ears.\u201dLu Sheng laughed eccentrically.\u201cThat woman actually rebuked me for doing that to her. So, with my saber, I hacked her into two halves, from top to toe. She thought that she wouldn\u2019t die. But all I had to do was to set her ablaze with my inner Qi. Just a few seconds and she was a goner. HAHAHAHA\u2026\u201dBefore his laughter could fade, the horse carriage shook on its own, as if somebody had pushed open its door violently from the inside.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Angry now? After that, I cut her head off, thinking that I\u2019d bring it back to use as a piss pot. But in the end, she couldn\u2019t even endure that last saber strike and\u2026 exploded?\u201d Lu Sheng said sinisterly.Inside the carriage, a young lady dressed entirely in red sat still, her face as white as a sheet of paper. Holding a big red lantern in her hand, she sat without a twitch on the seat.\u201cKa\u2026 ka\u2026\u201dThe lady\u2019s neck began turning, causing a strange sound of friction.Her head turned to face Lu Sheng, who was laughing eccentrically; she stared at him with deadpan eyes.\u201cYou knew that woman, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Lu Sheng gripped his saber hilt with both hands, his body arched in preparation. His eyes grew dark and cold. \u201cSo you\u2019ve come to avenge her death?\u201d\u201cCHI!\u201dThe lady in red vanished from within the carriage in an instant. When she appeared again, she was behind Lu Sheng.With a light wave of the lantern in her hand, it swung towards the back of Lu Sheng\u2019s neck silently.Lu Sheng responded with a backhand slash.\u201cSLASH!\u201dScorching waves of intense heat emanated from the cold, silver saber gleam. Ultimate Crimson Mantra accelerated to maximum speed, rapidly gushing into his saber\u2019s blade as it slashed violently across the lady in red.To Lu Sheng\u2019s surprise, however, his saber strike landed on thin air.The saber blade passed through the lady\u2019s body unobstructed, as if she were a mere mirage.\u2018What\u2019s going on!?\u2019 Without time for further thought, Lu Sheng saw the red lantern slamming squarely into his chest.\u201cBOOM!!!\u201dLu Sheng felt as if an object weighing hundreds of kilograms had just rammed into him at high speed. His whole body was pushed back by more than ten paces, his legs leaving two long trails on the ground, almost colliding into the horse carriage.Lu Sheng\u2019s face flashed red. Holding onto the edge of the carriage, he poured inner Qi into his saber blade and slashed towards his front forcefully again.\u201cSLASH!\u201dOnce again, the saber blade passed through the lantern lady who had just appeared before him. Her red lantern slammed into Lu Sheng\u2019s left shoulder.Slammed off balance, Lu Sheng stumbled several steps\u2014only to see the lady appearing suddenly in front of him before he could steady himself.\u201cBOOM!\u201dAnother hit. Fortunately, this hit landed on the side of his saber which barely blocked it. Still, the immense force of the collision pushed him off his feet onto the ground.\u2018Teleportation? No! That\u2019s not it. She\u2019s just so fast that it looks like teleportation to me!\u2019 Lu Sheng felt a burning pain on the two spots on his body where he had been hit. The pain was accompanied by a mild numbness and itch. Clearly, he had been poisoned.Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill hurriedly gushed to his wounds, resisting the possible infection and toxin.Swiftly, he flipped himself upright again and looked from left to right. The lady was nowhere to be seen, and neither could Lu Sheng sense any trace of her movement.\u2018She moves extremely fast, but still, she makes sounds,\u2019 Lu Sheng listened in utter concentration. Despite being hit twice, he was not gravely wounded due to his hard body skill and activation of inner Qi.His eyes were peeled on his surroundings, the carriage right by his side. It was clearly empty inside. Only the two red lanterns hung there, rocking about.\u2018Where\u2019s she gone to?\u2019Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cCHI!\u201dWithout warning, two red silk ribbons shot out from within the carriage, twisting around his neck from behind him with huge strength and force, attempting to wring his neck.Lu Sheng\u2019s face turned red as beetroot. Clutching onto the ribbons, Lu Sheng summoned his inner Qi. Intense heat generated by Ultimate Crimson Mantra quickly burned through the ribbons.\u201cRIP.\u201dHe ripped the ribbons apart and rolled forward, putting as much distance between himself and the carriage as possible.He had only just picked himself up when yet another red lantern came smashing in his direction.\u201cBANG!\u201dA mouthful of dirty blood gushed up from Lu Sheng\u2019s throat and seeped out of the corners of his mouth. He was forced back a few consecutive steps. His entire body felt as if it were on fire, with boiling hot inner Qi circling all over his saber and his arms.Looking to his left and right, he couldn\u2019t see a single soul.\u201cWhat? That\u2019s it?\u201d Mockingly, he pointed to his forehead, \u201cCome, hit here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Unable to contain the blood gushing out from inside him, blood spurted out from his mouth and splashed onto the ground.Another red silk ribbon shot out from the carriage, twisting itself around his waist, but was burnt through by Lu Sheng\u2019s scorching inner Qi in an instant.\u201cBAM!\u201dThe lady in red appeared on Lu Sheng\u2019s flank once again, striking him on his right shoulder with the lantern.\u201cCREAGHH\u2026\u201dAn indiscernible, guttural roar rang out from the lady\u2019s throat. She kept flashing here and there around Lu Sheng, smashing him on his head, his body, and his limbs.\u201cBAM BAM BAM BAM BAM.\u201dUnder the series of heavy hits, blood gushed out from Lu Sheng\u2019s mouth in spurts.\u201cHit harder! It\u2019s too light! Hehehehe\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng did not look bothered at all as he continued blocking with his saber. Sometimes, he managed to block the incoming attacks. But most of the time, he failed and took those hits by the toughness of his body.\u201cYou know how I killed her back then? I struck much harder than you\u2019re now. I hacked her into two halves right down her center. She thought she could recover, but I suppressed her with my inner Qi. I gave her pain like living hell! HAHAHAHAHA!!!\u201d Lu Sheng laughed madly, blood foaming at his mouth.\u201cCREAGH!!!\u201dThe lady in red\u2019s assaults increased in intensity and speed. Madly, she struck the red lantern against Lu Sheng incessantly, with ever-increasing force. At the same time, she scratched Lu Sheng with her free hand; sharp purplish black nails left streaks of blood on Lu Sheng\u2019s body.\u201cCHI!\u201dA chunk of flesh was savagely gouged out from the left side of Lu Sheng\u2019s waist. Rapidly, the wound began turning purplish black, but was quickly suppressed by Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill.Armed with lantern in one hand and fingernails on the other, the lady in red assaulted Lu Sheng as if she had gone crazy.Abruptly, a red light flashed and her arm glowed with a scarlet hue, as if a layer of scarlet ice had frozen over her hand. Immediately, her speed and strength drastically rose.\u201cCREAGH!!!\u201dPurplish black claws pierced towards Lu Sheng\u2019s chest, lightning-quick. She wished she could gouge out Lu Sheng\u2019s heart and liver to avenge her sister!!!The lady in red was extremely fast to begin with. Now with her drastically increased speed, she was too fast for Lu Sheng to duck; all he could do was slightly nudge away from his original position.\u201cCHI!\u201dThe sharp claw pierced deeply into Lu Sheng\u2019s right chest, pencil-straight. In the nick of time, Lu Sheng barely managed to shift slightly, causing the claw to miss his fatal spot by inches.Blood foamed continuously out of the wound. Lu Sheng was pushed back more than ten steps by a massive force. Oxygen mixed with blood and bubbled out of his chest.\u201cCREAGH!\u201dThe lady in red released her lantern and, with her other hand, pierced Lu Sheng\u2019s abdomen.Lu Sheng\u2019s entire body trembled. He gripped both her shoulders like a vice with his hands. Tried as the lady might, she was unable to break free from Lu Sheng\u2019s vice-like grip.\u201cI\u2019ve got you\u2026\u201d he lifted his face, filled with blood and filth, to reveal a hideously savage grin.SZZZZZZ\u2026..Steam began rising from both of them as blood was boiled by the scorching Ultimate Crimson Qi.\u201cROAR!!!\u201dAmidst an untamable tiger roar, Lu Sheng bellowed, and slammed his knee into the lady\u2019s torso without warning.\u201cBAM!!! BAM! BAM! BAM!!!\u201dThe lady in red struggled, screaming pathetically like an infant. Her torso had caved in from Lu Sheng\u2019s attacks. White smog billowed out from all around her body and her facial orifices.\u201cDidn\u2019t you have a good time smashing me earlier!?\u201d Clutching her hair, Lu Sheng smashed her head against his own.\u201cBOOM!\u201dA giant hole was smashed into the lady\u2019s head. White goo and smoke came up from it. She shrieked miserably, attempting to wrestle free with all her might. However, Lu Sheng held onto her mercilessly and sent her slamming backwards into an old tree by the road.In a loud bam, the trunk split.\u201cHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!\u201d Lu Sheng laughed like a madman, raining fists on her head, smashing her into a complete pulp. Her head was like a smashed watermelon and huge amount of white smoke billowed from her wound.\u201cDIDN\u2019T YOU COME TO KILL ME!? COME ON! COME ON! COME ON!!!\u201d His powerful punches landed continuously on her head and body.\u201cBAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!!!\u201dSeveral dozen punches had landed on her. Inner Qi flowed frenziedly in Lu Sheng\u2019s body; Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill continued to replenish Ultimate Crimson Qi, allowing him to put full might into each punch. His body was scorching hot like a furnace.The lady\u2019s head and neck had turned into charred pulp.Singlehandedly, Lu Sheng pulled her claws out of his body and hoisted her high up in the air under the dark clouds.Though left hanging on to her last breath, the lady retained one final strand of consciousness and reached out for Lu Sheng\u2019s arm.\u201cThis is the price to pay if you seek to kill me!\u201d\u201cRIP!!!\u201dWith one pull, he ripped the lady\u2019s battered head out from her body! A section of the spine still hung from the bottom of her head!Copious amounts of white goo splattered on him, but Lu Sheng was not bothered in the slightest. He roared in maniacal laughter towards the skies.Rolling on the ground, the light in the red lantern extinguished in that very instant.***In a dark gloomy forest, a thick canopy blotted out the sun, casting the entire area in gray darkness.A manor sat in the forest, covered in red roof tiles and seemingly inhabited by a large family. Inside and out, rows of red lanterns hung all over it.A lady in a white dress stood silently by the well in the courtyard under an umbrella. She seemed to be staring at her own reflection in the well.The red paper umbrella obstructed all view of her face. Only a long head of inky black hair fell straight down her back like a waterfall. The umbrella was decorated with pink plum blossom motifs, appearing even redder under the glow of the red lanterns in the manor.\u201cZhen Family\u2026 they\u2019ve killed many of us\u2026 what\u2026 should we do\u2026\u201d a stifled female voice rang out from under the umbrella, starting and stopping.\u201cThey\u2019re the real ones who got their hands on Scarlet Dragon Tribulation. Then they led so many factions astray simply with a piece of fake news and a pretense. Now that they\u2019re striking with full force, they prove themselves to be well-endowed indeed,\u201d a rather hoarse, devious female voice rang out from within the well. \u201cPreviously, they destroyed three of our bases. And now they\u2019re fighting our Anomalies head-on. Zhen Xun\u2026 he\u2019s quite some character. Impressive.\u201d\u201cShall I\u2026 kill him myself?\u201d The lady under the umbrella asked in a stutter.\u201cYou\u2019re not his match. The Zhen Family\u2019s acting so tough now. It must be because of their confidence in the Scarlet Dragon Tribulation,\u201d the voice in the well continued. \u201cThere\u2019re only so many Anomalies we can control and influence. To think that they\u2019d all be eliminated by them. We\u2019ve got to wait and see for now.\u201d\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d the lady under the umbrella replied.She stood by the well and waited for a while longer until the voice from within had completely ceased. Only then did she walk slowly to her bedroom in the manor.Before the bedroom, she looked up at the red lanterns hanging from the ceiling. Among the rows of red lanterns, at least fifteen of them had been extinguished, leaving a stretch of the corridor in darkness.\u201cDefeated and dispersed\u2026 fifteen of them? Even the one\u2026 sent to deal with the mortal\u2026 is gone too\u2026 they\u2019re really cleaning us up\u2026\u201d the lady under the umbrella mumbled, her voice still eccentric.\u201cZhen Xun\u2026 sooner or later I\u2019ll eat you\u2026\u201dA faint gust of wind blew past, and no person remained before the bedroom.***Lu Sheng clutched at his chest. The smell of burnt flesh emanated from it. Before long, his wound had been cauterized.He held onto his saber with his other hand; blood dripped slowly from his palm. In between his palm and saber hilt was a silver hairpin.It was the sort of silver hairpin one could buy anywhere on the streets\u2014very ordinary, worth only a few coins and weighing no more than a few grams.Lu Sheng had found it on the lantern lady.After the lantern lady had died, her entire body dissolved thoroughly into smoke, leaving behind only miscellaneous items like her clothes and the lantern. Lu Sheng found this silver hairpin among them. He attempted dripping his blood on to it and discovered that it was indeed filled with absorbable Yin Qi.Presently, Yin Qi seeped into his palm continuously. Though it was not thick, it kept flowing.Lu Sheng felt a fiery pain in his chest. The external wound was no longer bleeding, while the internal wounds were being healed by Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill. Together with Ultimate Crimson Mantra, he first pressed his arteries and veins together with his hand, then cauterized it with Ultimate Crimson Qi. Finally, Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill quickly healed the injury.During the combat, majority of his skill was spent on suppressing poison; the actual amount of inner Qi spent on attacks was rather minimal.Only a pile of red clothes and the horse carriage by the side remained on the ground. The lantern on the carriage had been extinguished. The black horse that had pulled the carriage stood still on the spot like a statue, blood flowing out from its orifices; it had died standing.Using his saber as a crutch, Lu Sheng chased after the carriage team, step by step.Before long, he was greeted with a series of hoof beats. Lifting his head, he saw that it was Jade Lotus riding hard towards him, with two disciples on horses behind him.Jade Lotus caught sight of Lu Sheng stumbling along by the road, covered in blood and being a mess. He was alarmed.\u201cYu~~~\u201d [1]The three of them flipped off their horses immediately.\u201cExternal Head!!\u201d\u201cExternal Head, are you alright!?\u201dThe three of them hurried forward to support Lu Sheng.\u201cI\u2019m alright. Why\u2019re there only the three of you? Have arrangements been made in the city?\u201d Before leaving them, Lu Sheng had instructed Jade Lotus to tidy up his territory in Mountain-Edge and monitor it for any unusual phenomena. Once an incident occurred, he was to immediately dispatch men to quarantine the area and coordinate with the yamen authorities in peacekeeping.\u201cAll\u2019s well in the city. External Head, how did you get so badly injured? Who in the region is capable of hurting you so gravely!?\u201d Jade Lotus asked somberly, at the same time taking out some medicine from his waist pouch to apply on Lu Sheng.\u201cI\u2019ll do it myself,\u201d Lu Sheng took the medicine and pulled away his robes to reveal the wounds on his chest and abdomen. Lightly, he sprinkled some medicinal powder on his wounds and rubbed evenly.\u201cIt\u2019s a long story\u2026 not something that you guys need to know. Let\u2019s head back first. My family\u2019s right ahead. You guys go ahead first to the forbidden zone.\u201dSeeing Lu Sheng\u2019s wounds, the trio including Jade Lotus sucked in a breath of cold air. Both wounds were purplish black in color\u2014a clear sign of poison.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Looks like poison, but I\u2019ve cauterized this part with inner Qi to isolate it. I just need to carve out some flesh when I get back,\u201d beads of sweat emerged on Lu Sheng\u2019s forehead as he explained, enduring the pain.\u201cI\u2019ve still got some poison antidotes here\u2026\u201d Jade Lotus hesitated.\u201cNo need. The average antidotes wouldn\u2019t help with this,\u201d Lu Sheng sensed that his poison could be counteracted with Yang-attribute inner Qi. After expending a huge amount of Ultimate Crimson Qi, the poison didn\u2019t seep deep into his body. He would recover as long as he hurried back to the city to carve out the poisoned flesh and sterilize his wounds.\u201cAlright then, I\u2019ll ride back with External Head. Both of you follow behind on a single horse,\u201d Jade Lotus quickly ordered.\u201cYes, sir!\u201dHaving made arrangements, the four of them rode hard in pursuit.Quickly, the carriage team appeared in sight. Thankfully, they were continuing steadily forward without much commotion among them.Lu Sheng did not alight from his horse. He looked awfully pale, his face drained of color. As he sped past the carriage team, his Old Dad Lu Quanan did not even have time to recognize him before he faded from their view.Along the way, Lu Sheng carefully observed his surroundings to ensure that the path ahead of the carriage team was safe. He gritted his teeth through the intense pain until he reached Mountain-Edge City. Only after instructing the sect disciples to receive his family\u2019s carriage team was he helped into the Golden Jade Greenhouse by Jade Lotus.The place had half become Lu Sheng\u2019s base of operation. He had even employed workmen to construct a new building here for him to rest in.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His hair stood on ends. To be able to survive such serious injuries and live to sit here before him for a physical examination\u2026 it simply defied all the medicinal principles he had learnt.\u201cPardon my frankness. External Head Lu is mainly suffering from excessive bleeding right now. As long as we put an end to the excessive bleeding, he will be fine. This old physician doesn\u2019t know how the External Head is stopping the bleeding right now, but from the looks of it, he\u2019s doing a good job,\u201d the physician hesitated before continuing, \u201cthese two deep wounds seem the result of someone\u2019s hands piercing into his inner organs\u2026\u201dSzzz\u2026A chill ran down Jade Lotus\u2019 back as he heard those words. What sort of person could have used their hands to pierce into External Head Lu\u2019s body?Ever since External Head Lu had openly bashed Deputy Sect Master Gongsun to death, he had been widely regarded as the Number Two expert in the Sect.Who would have the guts or the capability to hurt such a top expert?\u201cCut the nonsense. I\u2019ve stopped the bleeding, just cut away the rotten flesh, quick,\u201d Lu Sheng hurried.\u201cYes yes yes\u2026\u201d the old physician anxiously responded. He retrieved a sharp knife, which he began to use to cut away at the poisoned, rotten flesh between Lu Sheng\u2019s chest and abdomen, as well as at his waist.Jade Lotus, who stood at the side, glared intently at the old physician\u2019s hands. These were vital parts; naturally, he couldn\u2019t let down his guard as this outsider proceeded.Conversely, Lu Sheng didn\u2019t worry in the least. Even though his hard body skills had been defeated, his body was very sturdy, and his bones unyieldingly tough to begin with. Within him, Ultimate Crimson Mantra Qi circulated boundlessly. Any threatening move by the other party would be immediately detected by him and dealt with.Moreover, the reaction speed by a Spirit Focus expert was something beyond the imagination of the old physician. He could even respond to that female lantern ghost\u2019s teleportation-like movement, what more this?The silver blade sliced through Lu Sheng\u2019s charred rotten flesh little by little, which was then deposited onto a silver dish which had been prepared in advance. Lu Sheng\u2019s robes were opened wide, revealing the deep green veins bulging on his neck. His hand grasped onto the saber that had been stuck into the ground, his whole body unmoving.Jade Lotus didn\u2019t make a sound as he stood to the side, paying careful attention to every inch of the physician\u2019s movements.After the entire length of time it takes for a joss stick to burn, the physician finally removed the blade from Lu Sheng\u2019s torso. Heavy beads of perspiration could be seen on his forehead.\u201cLuckily, it\u2019s not life-threatening,\u201d he seemed like a huge weight had been lifted off his shoulders.\u201cMany thanks, doctor,\u201d Lu Sheng nodded. Next to him, Jade Lotus attentively dabbed away the perspiration that was on his forehead, somewhat effeminate in his manner.Lu Sheng didn\u2019t notice anything out of the ordinary. On the other hand, it was Jade Lotus himself who seemed to suddenly realize that something was amiss and immediately withdrew his hand.\u201cThis is the Crimson Snake powder, which this old physician personally concocted. It is able to target most poisons of the Yin-nature; take some orally and apply the rest externally. Also, there\u2019s this prescription. External Head, take three doses each day, and do not leave it overnight,\u201d the physician advised repeatedly before finally preparing to take his leave. \u201cThis old man will take his leave now. External Head, do rest early, that will aid in the recuperation from your injuries.\u201d\u201cMany thanks,\u201d waving his hand, Lu Sheng signaled for someone at the side to see him out.The room door shut tight, leaving behind just him and Jade Lotus.\u201cExternal Head, how did it get this perilous this time?\u201d Jade Lotus was grim as he asked gravely.\u201cHeh, an old foe came knocking, and even used my family to threaten me. It\u2019s lucky I survived,\u201d a fierce glint shone in Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes.\u201cIs it\u2026 that?\u201d Jade Lotus\u2019 voice hushed to a whisper.Lu Sheng looked at him, \u201cYou know about that?\u201d\u201c\u2026I heard the old Sect Master mention it previously,\u201d Jade Lotus nodded slightly. \u201cOtherwise, given your prowess, the only people capable of injuring you to this state in the whole of Mountain-Edge City, and the region beyond, are but peak experts like Old Sect Master.\u201d\u201cWe need to strengthen our defenses. They\u2019ve come right to my doorstep. I\u2019ll need you to look after the forbidden zones, and arrange the men to guard them closely. No human being is allowed in or out in the next ten days, understood?\u201d Lu Sheng asked grimly.\u201cNo problem. External Head, just focus on your recovery. I\u2019ll handle the miscellaneous duties,\u201d Wang Lianzi nodded.\u201cFocus on recovery? I fear I have too many things on my mind\u2026\u201d shaking his head, Lu Sheng did not elaborate.The two of them chatted some more on the matters that had recently cropped up. Most of the time, it was Jade Lotus reporting, with Lu Sheng just listening.After giving a rough overview of the situation, Jade Lotus exited the room and shut the doors, at the same time instructing the servants to serve the food.Lu Sheng wolfed down a full three catties worth of stewed rabbit meat, two deer legs, four catties of vegetables and tofu, as well as an entire tub of rice. Only then was he satisfied and dismissed the servants.After his meal, he rested for a bit more before rising to head out.It was already dark outside.Lu Sheng instructed someone to bring his horse over, which he flipped onto. Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill had already been exhausted by more than half, leaving behind a mere third of it that was still pouring into his wounds unceasingly. It helped his injuries to recover, such that he didn\u2019t have much trouble moving around.\u201cNing San!\u201d\u201cYes! Big Bro!\u201d Ning San dashed out from the side. He had been waiting there all this time for instructions.\u201cHow\u2019s the situation with my family? Do you know?\u201d Lu Sheng asked as he rode.\u201cOld Master Lu has already settled down in the Eastern Lake district of the city. He bought a house there with sufficiently large grounds. All of them have arrived there safely by now,\u201d Ning San answered promptly. \u201cYour subordinate went earlier to secretly protect them for a stretch of the journey. Presently, Duan Meng\u2019an has led a team to covertly watch over them.\u201d\u201cNot bad, you knew to arrange covert protection,\u201d satisfied, Lu Sheng nodded. \u201cPick a few men to inform Qiao\u2019er that I\u2019m well. I\u2019m going to that Eastern Lake district you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dNing San responded loudly.Lu Sheng headed straight for Mountain-Edge City by horse.The night was gloomy as moonlight shone through like gauze. The nighttime scene in Mountain-Edge City was a picture of activity as various barbecue and snack stalls of all shapes and sizes were set up near the city entrance.Adults with children in town, veiled ladies, scholarly Young Masters and their servant maids\u2014people from all walks of life and of all shapes and sizes formed a bustling throng.Lu Sheng slowed his horse to a trot. Seeing a few Crimson Whale Sect members standing guard by the city gates, Lu Sheng sought directions to Eastern Lake district from them. After that, he picked up his speed.After less than half the time it takes for a joss stick to burn, Lu Sheng found Lu Manor, which was currently setting off firecrackers to celebrate the relocation.Booming sounds rang out as the firecrackers exploded, causing all sorts of red and yellow confetti to swirl around in the sky. A group of little children had gathered around to soak in the atmosphere.Lu Quanan stood at the main entrance, looking on as someone hoisted up the Lu Manor plaque onto the beams. His face was shrouded in worry. To the side, Third Mother Wang Yanyu sniffed away with a handkerchief in her hands, which she used to dab at her eyes.Two local officials of Mountain-Edge City stood next to Lu Quanan, rambling on and on.Lu Sheng alighted from the horse and bound it with a rope to a nearby tree. Only after the firecrackers had ceased did he stride over.\u201cBrother Sheng!\u201d Someone from the Lu Manor saw him and exclaimed in surprise.\u201cBrother Sheng is here!\u201d\u201cEldest Young Master is here!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Eldest Young Master!\u201dSmiles of joy broke out on the faces of all present. They all regarded him as their backbone. Evidently, his present status in the Lu Manor was unrivaled.\u201cAiyo! Such serious injuries!\u201d One of the martial arts masters in the family could immediately see that Lu Sheng had been bandaged up in many places.His chest, abdomen, waist, shoulders and arms\u2026 his entire body was covered in injuries.Uncle Zhao approached to take a look, his face grave.\u201cBrother Sheng, who hurt you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Uncle Zhao, I know what I\u2019m doing, I\u2019m able to take care of it,\u201d smiling, Lu Sheng patted Uncle Zhao\u2019s shoulders. Then, he walked in front of Lu Quanan.\u201cDad, is everyone alright?Lu Quanan looked at his battered state and knew that it was caused by that person from before. His eyes grew moist.He had already lost one son. If the Eldest Young Master Lu Sheng was also gone, then the entire Lu Family would have lost all hope.Presently, Lu Sheng was the cornerstone of the Lu Family.Lu Quanan extended his hands in an attempt to touch Lu Sheng\u2019s wounds.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Lu Sheng blocked his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll handle Chenxin\u2019s matter. Dead or alive, I\u2019ll bring him back. Rest assured.\u201d\u201cSorry to trouble you. A pity that your dad\u2019s useless and can\u2019t help you much\u2026 and has even become your burden,\u201d Lu Quanan sighed as he heard those words. He was unable to hold in his tears any longer and quickly used his hands to cover them.\u201cNo worries. Once this matter is settled, our Lu Family will only continue to get stronger,\u201d Lu Sheng consoled.\u201cMm! Definitely.\u201dLu Sheng finally felt some peace after visiting his family. He didn\u2019t return to his lodging, but instead got someone to fetch Qiao\u2019er to the new Lu Manor. As for himself, he returned to the greenhouse and continued staying there.The recent several big battles had clearly shown him that he was still not powerful enough.\u2018Previously, my strength was considered to be at the apex for the ordinary human beings. However, when I\u2019m up against these supernatural ghosts, it\u2019s still far too weak,\u2019 after Lu Sheng returned to the greenhouse, he washed up and rested.His heart grew more and more anxious as he lay on the mattress.\u2018Then, how exactly can I deal with these supernatural beings effectively, without injuring myself?\u2019 He began to ponder.\u2018From what I know of the ghosts that I\u2019ve encountered, no matter how powerful, or how strange they are, at the end of the day, they must materialize to inflict any harm on humans. Some employ poison, some use weapons, others their sharp claws. Their might is comparable to that of a Spirit Focus expert, but they are far superior in terms of speed.Of course, those that I\u2019ve encountered are merely their foot soldiers. If I were up against someone like Zhen Yi, a Nobleman\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng recalled the scene from earlier. Zhen Yi\u2019s head had almost been completely slashed into two, and yet it had been able to merge back rapidly. A chill crept into his heart.Such recuperative powers meant that he was almost impossible to kill.\u2018If such terrifying recuperative powers were available to all Noblemen and supernatural beings of that level\u2026 then I have to consider massively strengthening my hard body skills. My first priority is to preserve my life. If I can\u2019t deliver a killing blow, then I can only stretch out the battle to exhaust their strength. I need to first be able to stand my ground.\u2019Lu Sheng once again thought back to the nature-defying speed displayed by the female lantern ghost, as well as how Zhen Yi suddenly appeared behind him without warning.\u2018How do I deal with such speed?\u2019Even after thinking it through for a long time, Lu Sheng still could not come up with any viable solutions to the problem. He could only put the matter to rest for the time being.No matter what, one thing was certain\u2014he had to continually upgrade himself.He lay back on the bed, taking out the silver hairpin left behind by the female lantern ghost and holding it in his hand. By now, there was no longer any Yin Qi inside it to absorb.\u2018I remember that the body doesn\u2019t expend any essence or Qi when I use Yin Qi to extrapolate martial arts. In fact, the skill is upgraded to a whole new level after extrapolation.This means that I can consume Yin Qi as a replacement, and continue to upgrade martial arts skills!\u2019 That thought suddenly surfaced into Lu Sheng\u2019s mind, causing both his eyes to sparkle brightly.If what he speculated was indeed the case, then it meant that Yin Qi was useful not just for extrapolating martial arts skills, but can also be used directly to upgrade the level of his skills.\u2018Deep Blue!\u2019 He promptly called out the Modifier in his mind.Instantly, the pale blue square frame surfaced before his eyes with a \u2018swish\u2019.Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze quickly zoomed in on Ultimate Crimson Mantra.\u2018Ultimate Crimson Mantra: Level Five. Special Effect(s): Intensified Fire Poison, Double Tremor, Intensified Incendiary.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Kurisu\u2018Level Five\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng saw that there was indeed a button for martial arts extrapolation behind it. In actual fact, there was no indication on the button that it was meant only for martial arts extrapolation.That was but his assumption.As long as there was sufficient Yin Qi, such a button would appear behind all martial arts. Coincidentally, he had already attained the pinnacle level of all his previous martial arts. Hence, when he pressed the button, it resulted in extrapolation. Presently, however, Ultimate Crimson Mantra had seven levels in total and there was no way for him to cultivate it to its pinnacle level in the short term. That was how he came to see, for the first time, the button appearing after a martial art that had yet to be mastered at its pinnacle level.\u2018Let\u2019s give it a shot,\u2019 Lu Sheng focused his attention on the button behind the Ultimate Crimson Mantra and tapped it.\u201cSwish.\u201dOn the Modifier, Ultimate Crimson Mantra\u2019s box blurred, becoming clear once again after two breaths.\u201cUltimate Crimson Mantra: Level Six. Special Effect(s): Intensified Fire Poison, Four-fold Tremor, Intensified Incendiary.\u201d\u2018It really worked!?\u2019Overwhelmed with joy, Lu Sheng examined his own skill.On the surface, it seemed as if it had merely been upgraded to Level Six. But he clearly sensed the warm flow of inner Qi thickening by more than a fold in his body. All over him, his wounds started to itch.\u2018I can\u2019t see much use for the Tremor effect. But earlier, when I fought the lantern lady, my hits seemed heavier than I had expected. That\u2019s probably the might of the Tremor effect. Now, it\u2019s four-fold. It should be even more powerful.\u2019With his inner Qi upgraded, Lu Sheng sensed that his cultivation had deepened. Perhaps his strikes were stronger now too. But, he was still a distance away from being able to fight beings like the lantern lady head on.\u2018That lantern lady\u2026 if I hadn\u2019t set my mind to exchange a body of wounds for the opportunity to grab onto her\u2026 if it had been someone else, not me\u2026 they would have been tormented to death.\u2019He looked at the Modifier again. All buttons had disappeared. Clearly, Yin Qi was no longer sufficient to continue.\u2018Since Yin Qi can upgrade skills too, then I can simply search for and gather items with Yin Qi everywhere. Or even actively hunt ghosts,\u2019 Lu Sheng made up his mind to focus on upgrading his skills without caring about other worries. As long as he kept getting stronger, he was sure that there bound to be a way to deal with them. He refused to believe that he would still be unable to deal with a few ghosts given his law-defying Modifier.With the Yin Qi from the silver hairpin exhausted, he kept it and went to bed.After a night of deep sleep,Lu Sheng awoke and had breakfast early the next day, before sunrise. Then, he made a beeline for the Crimson Whale.On the third story of the tower atop the ship, he found the Old Sect Master in the pharmacy, consuming white stone powder.The sun\u2019s beams shone into the pharmacy from the side windows, landing onto a yellowish bronze pill cauldron about the height of a man, illuminating the crane and bird motifs carved onto it.Dressed in plain white, old Sect Master\u2019s left hand seemed obviously distorted and was anchored to his neck with a piece of wood.He was unsurprised by Lu Sheng\u2019s visit.\u201cJunior Apprentice Brother, looks like you fared even worse than me.\u201d\u201cSenior Apprentice Brother, you too\u2026\u201d the corner of Lu Sheng\u2019s mouth twitched. He fell speechless at the sight of old Sect Master\u2019s plight.\u201cForbidden zones aren\u2019t that easily guarded,\u201d old Sect Master sighed. \u201cSo many incidents have occurred one after another in such a short time. The mortals cry when deities fight. Just these minor demons and minor ghosts are enough to be quite a handful for us.\u201d\u201cHow does Senior Apprentice Brother deal with those extremely fast ghosts?\u201d Lu Sheng made this visit primarily for answers. Old Sect Master had lived so long. As the present Sect Chief of Crimson Sun Sect, he must have some tricks up his sleeves.As expected, a faint smile appeared on old Sect Master\u2019s face at the question.\u201cI knew you\u2019d ask me this, just like I asked my Master back then.\u201dHe rose, walked to the window and gazed out through it.Cypress Pine Lake flowed without end, its waves slapping onto the sides of the Crimson Whale as it was carried by the wind.\u201cOur Crimson Sun Sect naturally possesses more than one inner skill\u2014the Ultimate Crimson Mantra. To be specific, we also possess several first-rate combat martial arts passed down through the generations,\u201d Hong Mingzi said softly.A look of earnestness came upon Lu Sheng.\u201cMay Senior Apprentice Brother please advise.\u201dHong Mingzi smiled and turned around.\u201cEach of these martial arts is deep and profound, building upon Ultimate Crimson Mantra as its foundation. The stronger your Ultimate Crimson Mantra, the more powerful these combat skills,\u201d he paused. Then, he continued, \u201cI won\u2019t elaborate on the rest. Too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing. Your senior brother here will just tell you about a saber technique appropriate for you. You\u2019re already well-versed in the long saber and palm techniques. Both of them carry some definite similarities. This saber technique should be sufficient to supplement your inadequacy in offensive strength.\u201d\u201cMay Senior Apprentice Brother please teach me,\u201d Lu Sheng rose as well and said somberly.Hong Mingzi smiled and nodded, \u201cThis saber technique is called \u2018Changing the Heavens in Seven Days Saber Technique\u2019.\u201c\u2019Changing the Heavens in Seven Days Saber Technique\u2019? I like this name,\u201d Lu Sheng licked his lips.\u201cThis saber technique requires the use of a heavy weapon. The heavier the better and more powerful. It\u2019s specially designed to complement the Tremor ability of Ultimate Crimson Mantra,\u201d Hong Mingzi explained.\u201cTremor ability?\u201d Lu Sheng mused, \u201cThen can I use a hammer? Hammers are heavy. Wouldn\u2019t they be even more powerful?\u201d\u201cEr\u2026 well, it didn\u2019t say you can\u2019t\u2026\u201d Hong Mingzi was stumped by the question. This was clearly a saber technique, but Lu Sheng thought out of the box and came up with the idea of using a hammer instead.\u201cAfter mastering this Changing the Heavens in Seven Days Saber Technique, you\u2019ll be able to deploy an inner Qi web with Ultimate Crimson Qi. Its area of effect is very large, making it extremely effective against speed-type opponents,\u201d old Sect Master continued. \u201cAre you interested to learn it?\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d Lu Sheng said without hesitation.\u201cThe strokes aren\u2019t difficult. It\u2019s mainly about pairing them with the mantra. Let me explain it briefly and you\u2019ll see what I mean\u2026\u201d Hong Mingzi began explaining to Lu Sheng the specific method of cultivation and points to take note of regarding Changing the Heavens in Seven Days Saber Technique.There were only a total of two strokes, with over ten transformations and permutations. Lu Sheng quickly learnt them all.A box appeared on the Modifier for Changing the Heavens in Seven Days Saber Technique.The duo worked till noon, one of them teaching, the other learning.\u201cOh, Junior Apprentice Brother, what level have you attained in cultivating Ultimate Crimson Mantra? Was the conversion from your previous skill successful?\u201d Hong Mingzi asked as the thought popped up in his mind. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you\u2019d rather not say.\u201d\u201cLevel Four,\u201d Lu Sheng did not mention his recent breakthroughs, stating only his previous level. He was indeed at Level Four by the time he had completely converted Blood Fury Skill.\u201cMm, about the same as I estimated. Ultimate Crimson Qi at Level Four is good enough to activate Changing the Heavens in Seven Days Saber Technique. Shouldn\u2019t be a problem handling an average ghost or a small demon,\u201d Hong Mingzi nodded.\u201cSenior Apprentice Brother, I\u2019ve got a question but I\u2019m not sure if I should ask,\u201d Lu Sheng pretended to hesitate, a frown on his forehead.\u201cYou and I are brother disciples of the same sect. We\u2019re the only two living members of Crimson Sun Sect; when I die, you\u2019ll be the Sect Chief. What\u2019s there you can\u2019t ask?\u201d Hong Mingzi waved his hand casually. \u201cGo ahead.\u201dLu Sheng tidied up his thoughts before speaking, \u201cI\u2019d like to ask: Noble Families and demons or ghosts\u2026 where exactly are they stronger than us\u2026?\u201d He whispered, keeping his voice as low and soft as possible.But, with his profound cultivation at Level Six of the Ultimate Crimson Mantra, old Sect Master naturally had acute senses and immediately heard his question as clear as day.Instantly, the smile on his face dissipated, and his brows locked together in a furrow.\u201cI\u2019ve spent several decades researching this problem. Only after that did I arrive at a postulation.\u201d\u201cSeveral decades?\u201dHong Mingzi nodded.\u201cDid you imagine that these high and mighty beings would have much contact with mortals like us? All I had to work with were bits and pieces of information acquired through eavesdropping as well as some clues from my observations. I deduced the answer from those.\u201d\u201cMay Senior Apprentice Brother please enlighten me,\u201d Lu Sheng requested.Hong Mingzi took out another packet of white stone powder. This was a relaxant that had mild hallucination-inducing effects and was very popular in Mountain-Edge City. There were no side effects from consuming it, yet it helped to relax one\u2019s nerves.\u201cNoble Families, Anomalies, Devils. These are the true overlords of this world. They are the deities and the devils\u2014the origin of all legends and myths,\u201d Hong Mingzi said slowly with a hint of reminiscence.\u201cTo say the least, there are two facts about them.\u201dHe raised two fingers.\u201cFirstly, these three beings cannot die.\u201d\u201cCannot die!?\u201d Lu Sheng was shaken.\u201cThat\u2019s right, they just cannot die,\u201d Hong Mingzi said bitterly, \u201cNo matter what method we use, unless they kill one another, they cannot be killed by mortals. As for the reason, I have not discovered it. I\u2019m still researching it. Otherwise, given our strength, even if there may be a gap, it wouldn\u2019t be such an insurmountable chasm.\u201dLu Sheng recalled the little girl from Song Manor and fell into silence.\u201cSecondly, they have a kind of power that is extremely lethal to us mortals. They term this power: Bind.\u201cBind?\u201d Lu Sheng replied.\u201cIndeed. \u2018Bind\u2019 as in \u2018to bind up\u2019,\u201d Hong Mingzi sighed. \u201cDevils, Anomalies, and Noblemen are innately gifted with the power they call Bind from birth. Other beings like ghosts and demons must cultivate it.Only after attaining the level of Bind can one resist the lethal poison all around them, one which kills at the slightest touch. Otherwise, any physical contact with them, except when they suppress and contract their own power, would be fatal.\u201d\u201cBind\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng fell deep in thought.\u201cThey cannot die, and their entire bodies are covered in lethal poison that kills with a touch. That\u2019s the power of Bind. Even if you or I touch it, it\u2019d be a handful to handle. Apart from expending massive amounts of inner Qi and cutting off the affected flesh immediately, there\u2019s no way to nullify it at all,\u201d Hong Mingzi put down the white stone powder in his hand.\u201cBased on the intelligence I gathered from eavesdropping, Bind is a realm of power, a level. It is a natural transformation that occurs to one after attaining a certain height in cultivation. Any fully formed Anomaly, Devil, or Nobleman would possess the power of Bind. Unless they contract it of their own will, any mortal who touches them will die.\u201dLu Sheng recalled how physically close he had gotten with Duanmu Wan. Cold sweat broke out on his back. If Duanmu Wan had been careless for the slightest moment and accidentally failed to contract her power of Bind, he would probably have been rotting away by now. When he had touched Zhen Yi\u2019s hand print, which was left behind unintentionally, with his finger, he had been forced to cut the affected part of it off to avoid the spread of the poison. If he had come into direct physical contact with him\u2026\u201cThen Song Manor\u2026?\u201d He abruptly recalled from his memory.\u201cThat was an Anomaly which had yet to form fully. Why else would it be so weak? To us, that is a dangerous place. But to those in that word, it is but a mere half-formed, aborted and abandoned ground,\u201d old Sect Master explained. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve observed that the power of Bind dissolves on its own within a joss stick\u2019s duration after leaving its owner\u2019s body. And, it cannot spread or expand.\u201d\u201cIn that case, Senior Apprentice Brother, have you ever come into direct contact with the power of Bind before?\u201d Lu Sheng asked. \u201cAmong us martial arts cultivators, is there any possibility of resisting such power? Or of attaining such a mode?\u201d\u201cResist?\u201d Hong Mingzi shook his head. \u201cImpossible. With this old man\u2019s skills, I can rank among the top three in all Northern Lands. Even in Central Plains, I would have a place among the top-notch experts. Any higher and I would be a Divine Prime expert, on the very pinnacle of the Dao of martial arts. Yet even then, it would still be impossible.Moreover, regarding attaining such a level, your senior apprentice brother here did use to guess that the power of Bind was a naturally induced reaction after one achieves a certain level. But later on, I discovered it was not so,\u201d Hong Mingzi\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cBe it its poisonous nature, or its defensive ability to isolate and protect its owner, the power of Bind is like a layer of eggshell. It covers these undying beings thoroughly. Unless one is able to break through it, one would not even be able to lay a scratch on them, not to mention breaking through their indestructible bodies.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Who\u2019s to say that there isn\u2019t a possible way out when one cultivates inner Qi to an unprecedented realm?\u201d He half-joked.\u201c\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng remained silent, but his face looked ugly.\u201cAlright, you\u2019ve asked your questions. If there\u2019s nothing else, go back and nurse your wounds. Since you\u2019ve been wounded on official business this time, you can collect medicinal powder from the pharmacy. Your contributions will also be recorded. It\u2019ll be pegged at Grade A, Third Class,\u201d old Sect Master said. \u201cEnough for you to exchange for assorted skills and pills or weapons. But, I advise you to spend them on a weapon suited to yourself.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Lu Sheng was uninterested in these. His thoughts dwelled on old Sect Master\u2019s last line\u2014all inner Qi of Yang-attribute had some effect against them.\u2018So it has some effect\u2026\u2019Leaving the pharmacy, he headed straight back to the greenhouse. Ning San and Duan Meng\u2019an were already waiting there.\u201cBig Bro, there\u2019s news!\u201d Ning San hurried up to him. \u201cYoung Master Lu Chenxin\u2019s corpse\u2026 was found in the forest by the village\u2026\u201d\u201cHow was he found?\u201d Lu Sheng was surprised and asked in a whisper. Actually, ever since Lu Chenxin went missing, he had already guessed that the odds were slim for him. Yet because they lacked much feelings between them, he did not feel much sadness, only some pity.\u201cTwo disciples went into the forest to relieve themselves. One of them caught sight of a hand sticking out from the ground and sent men to dig there. They dug out four corpses\u2026\u201dDuan Meng\u2019an added on, \u201cTwo city garrison guards, Young Master Lu Chenxin, as well as an unknown farmer.\u201dLu Sheng fell into silence.\u201cWhere\u2019s the corpse now?\u201d He asked a while later.\u201cIt\u2019s still where it was found,\u201d Ning San quickly answered.\u201cKeep it from my family for the time being,\u201d Lu Sheng said calmly.\u201cYes, sir!\u201dLu Sheng intended to reveal the news to his family at a more opportune time. He understood clearly that while his old Dad Lu Quanan was mentally prepared for Lu Chenxin\u2019s death, his Third Mother Wang Yanyu would be devastated. Lu Chenxin was her only son.It would not be too late for him to tell them after the lockdown on the deserted village is lifted.Lu Sheng summoned Jade Lotus and enquired about the subsequent arrangements. After ensuring that all was in order, he returned to his room to apply medicine and rest.In the afternoon, news came from the Crimson Whale that the Dong Family villa near Mountain-Edge City had met with a landslide. Many of them were buried alive and they needed manpower to handle the aftermath.Lu Sheng let Jade Lotus dispatch an expert from Soaring Eagle Squad, who brought with him over thirty men and various tools and instruments. He himself remained in the room resting and nursing his wounds.In the evening, the expert returned, his face looking upset. Not only him, but Jade Lotus who had accompanied him also had a long face.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did a mishap occur?\u201dOutside the greenhouse, Lu Sheng was slowly executing the basic moves of Heart Shattering Palm as a form of exercise. He asked Jade Lotus while exercising.\u201cNo,\u201d Jade Lotus shook his head. \u201cThere weren\u2019t any mishaps. It\u2019s just that the corpses that needed handling weren\u2019t killed by the landslide. Rather, each of them had been ripped into shreds. Even the government officials puked.\u201d\u201cRipped into shreds?\u201d Lu Sheng paused in his moves. He knew for certain that it was again the work of the supernatural.\u201cLooking at the marks left behind, there seemed to be two opposing forces fighting against each other. The scene was bloodied and savage; broken limbs were all over and even internal organs and spines could be seen,\u201d Jade Lotus replied.Lu Sheng shut his eyes in contemplation.\u201cJust handle this matter as if it was a mere landslide. Don\u2019t bother yourselves with the details. And instruct the brothers who followed to be tight-lipped. Each of them may collect a tael of silver from the accounts room.\u201d\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Jade Lotus nodded.\u201cAlso, things may get chaotic outside these few days. Give orders that our men are not to venture far,\u201d Lu Sheng instructed.\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all, you may go back now,\u201d Lu Sheng patted Jade Lotus\u2019 shoulder to reassure him.During this period, the Zhen Family had been warring against a ghost faction. Lu Sheng guessed that this must have been the aftershock of the earlier fight over that treasure.The lantern lady clearly belonged to a certain organization of which the earlier Red Decks pleasure boat was a part. Perhaps the ghost who had caused trouble for him this last time was in one of the factions which were locked in combat with the Zhen Family.Jade Lotus turned around and left.Staring at his back, Lu Sheng thought to himself, \u2018Strictly speaking, I\u2019m just one of many leaders in Crimson Whale Sect. That\u2019s just someone who tidies up after the Zhen Family. No one has come seeking trouble for me, so nobody should know that I was the one who killed the lantern lady yet. As long as I\u2019m not exposed, I\u2019m safe for the time being.A war on that level isn\u2019t something that I can get myself embroiled in at my present level. My priority now is to upgrade my strength as far as possible. That way I can at least guarantee my personal safety in this world of chaos. As for how I can upgrade myself\u2026\u2019***For a series of days, news regarding missing persons kept popping up around Mountain-Edge City every day. The authorities posted a notice, explaining that a powerful band of bandits called Stone Peak Bandits has been robbing travelers near Mountain-Edge City and left no survivors due to their cruel modus operandi. All citizens were to avoid travelling outwards, especially on paths apart from the main path.Instantly, the entire Mountain-Edge City descended into a state of fear. Everyone reduced their trips outwards. Even the merchant teams and ox carts transporting vegetables and fruits drastically decreased in number.Crimson Whale Sect, along with the other sects and societies and gangs, assisted the authorities to stabilize the situation as far as possible. Once an incident occurred, mouths were silenced and money was dispensed to handle the aftermath.Although Lu Sheng stayed in the greenhouse to nurse his wounds the entire time, there were at least three cases which were brought to him. He went to take a look; they were all scenes of brutal savagery, with broken limbs and corpses strewn all over. One glance at them showed that they were not the work of humans.Even with his present cultivation, he was able to detect a faint trace of Yin coldness\u2014clearly an evidence of the supernatural\u2019s involvement.The situation went on for several days before the Zhen Family finally contacted them again.Two representatives came\u2014a young man and a young woman. They commandeered two healthy horses from the Crimson Whale and rode off straight towards the Wenglin Plains in the south. Lu Sheng did not even get the chance to see them.News came back the next day that a blazing fire raged on the plains. A village of shepherds and herdsmen who lived on the plains in the direction towards Mountain-Edge City vanished without a trace.Two large pleasure boats on Cypress Pine Lake lit up in flames as well. Not a single lady or customer managed to escape from them. Lu Sheng knew that this was Zhen Family\u2019s retaliation. Mountain-Edge City fell under Zhen Family\u2019s territory and boundaries. It was natural that the ghost faction\u2019s provocations would start a war.Despite the intensity of the war outside, Lu Sheng threw everything to Jade Lotus to manage. He himself entered Mountain-Edge City for his personal plans, using the cover story that he needed to nurse his wounds.***\u201cAlmond Blossom Wine! Top-grade Almond Blossom Wine! Try a sip! Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back!\u201d\u201cDeer Antler Wine! Three coins for an urn! Five coins for two urns!\u201d\u201cThree-year-old Bear Fruit Wine! Ten coins for an urn! Lowest price in town!\u201dAlong Mountain-Edge City\u2019s Fragrant Wine Street One, Lu Sheng strolled leisurely out of a wine store with a white square box on his palm.He wore a light-green robe and donned a scholar\u2019s hat on his head, hiding his bald head entirely.Walking to the side of the road, he hefted the box in his hand and hailed a horse carriage.\u201cWhere to, Young Master?\u201d The driver asked with a smile.\u201cFine Treasures Hall,\u201d Lu Sheng told him the destination softly.\u201cAlrighty, please sit tight,\u201d the driver lashed his whip and the old horse immediately began trotting forward. The carriage trudged on along the street, effortful but steady.Sitting in the carriage, Lu Sheng let down the curtain. Then, he placed the white box on his lap and gently opened it.Ten small porcelain vials were placed in the box. They were all white vials with narrow necks, each of them stuffed with a white cloth at its opening. The white porcelain vials lay on a layer of black silk, presenting a stark visual contrast.Lu Sheng retrieved a vial and gingerly pulled out the white cloth stopper and peered inside.The porcelain vial contained an extraordinarily black liquid. The moment the stopper was pulled out, the thick fragrance of wine wafted into the wind.\u2018All manners of wonders exist in this vast world. Who\u2019d have thought that senior apprentice brother would discover such a method to store and preserve the power of Bind in strong alcohol?\u2019 Lu Sheng exclaimed inwardly. \u2018If I had to figure it out via trial-and-error, who knows how long it\u2019d take for me to come across such a method?\u2019With intense concentration, he gently tipped the vial to a side and poured out a drop of black liquid, the size of a sesame seed, onto his palm.\u201cSzzzzz\u2026..\u201dIn that very instant, Lu Sheng\u2019s palm turned red as Ultimate Crimson Qi gushed madly into his palm, resisting the black liquid intensely.The skin on his palm turned black, then white, seesawing between the two. A scent of rotten flesh emanated from his palm. It was like meat left lying for a long time which had decomposed.This was his senior\u2019s own discovery\u2014that the power of Bind could be preserved in strong alcohol. It was a convenient method for him to test how high a level his own cultivation had attained\u2014whether or not it had reached a realm sufficient to rival the monsters who were of Bind Level.Soon, within the span of ten breaths, the drop of liquid in Lu Sheng\u2019s palm gradually evaporated into thin air. Beads of sweat had broken out all over Lu Sheng\u2019s body. His face was as pale as paper.Gazing at his palm, he smiled bitterly in helplessness.\u2018Based on senior apprentice brother\u2019s research, the weakest form of the power of Bind is equivalent to at least ten porcelain vials. If I truly desire to defeat mature Anomalies and Noblemen, the basic requirement is for me to be able to resist the power of Bind. If I can\u2019t even handle the poison of Bind, then it means that even the slightest physical contact with them would be fatal for me, not to mention breaking through their Bind barrier.\u2019He recalled the look of defeat and anguish on old Sect Master\u2019s face when he had requested for these porcelain vials from him. Apparently, he had attempted to resist the poison and power of Bind too. It was a pity that he had failed, just as expected.\u2018My present cultivation is Ultimate Crimson Mantra Level Six\u2014about equal to my senior apprentice brother. But, practically speaking, I\u2019m slightly stronger. Senior apprentice brother is, after all, advanced in age and needs to expend much of his cultivation base on maintaining his body\u2019s performance. I\u2019m a different story.\u2019Lu Sheng shook the porcelain vial. It was completely empty inside. Each vial contained merely one drop of alcohol infused with Bind, the size of a sesame seed.Such extraordinary power could be preserved for over a decade in concentrated alcohol with merely a slight reduction in its potency.\u2018With my cultivation base, I can only barely resist ten percent of Bind poison. The difference between them is too wide a gap\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng exclaimed in his mind. \u2018Let\u2019s hope this trip to Fine Treasures Hall will be richly rewarded.\u2019He had come out this time partially to take a stroll to clear his mind by personally buying alcohol, and partially because Mountain-Edge City\u2019s largest antique shop, Fine Treasures Hall, had just informed him that a batch of goods has just arrived, inviting him to take his pick.Fine Treasures Hall was the property of She Lin Society, one of the noted societies in Mountain-Edge City.She Lin Society was on pretty good terms with Crimson Whale Sect. Lu Sheng had informed them beforehand of his desire for some artifacts excavated from graves, to which they readily agreed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Aiyo, why didn\u2019t you tell us in advance that you were coming? We would have sent out a welcome team to greet you!\u201d The store owner rushed out to apologize once he saw Lu Sheng.Among those in the know in Mountain-Edge City, who would be ignorant of External Head Lu\u2019s reputation as the one who beat Sect Master Gongsun to death? Immediately after that battle, he had forged an image for himself in their hearts\u2014that of a powerful but brutal expert.\u201cPlease enter! Please enter!\u201d The store owner was a rotund man who did his best to open his small eyes wide. Every now and then, he would wipe sweat off his face with his sleeves. Presently, he led Lu Sheng into the store.\u201cWhere\u2019s the stuff?\u201d Lu Sheng could not bother to admire the fa\u00e7ade of the store. He was in a rush to upgrade himself while the Zhen Family and ghost faction were in the heat of battle, busy with each other.\u201cHere! The stuff\u2019s all here!\u201d The store owner quickly replied. After leading Lu Sheng into the store, they passed through it into the rear hall and came to two large crates in the corner of it.\u201cThis has truly just been unearthed. We haven\u2019t even had the time to wash the smell of earth off them. Please put up with it for a while,\u201d the store owner smiled apologetically.\u201cYou two. Open up these crates!\u201dHastily, he instructed the store employees standing aside to open the crates.These muscular employees came forward, unlocked the crates and swiftly opened their lids.\u201cClang.\u201dThe lids slammed into the wall behind them in a deep thud, revealing a host of random assorted artifacts.\u201cNo problem, they\u2019re fresh like I wanted them to be,\u201d Lu Sheng was not bothered. Squatting down, he randomly picked up a bronze sword.No Yin Qi.He switched to a bronze candlestick.No Yin Qi either.The third one was a short iron sword.None again.\u201cI\u2019ll look through them on my own. No need to care about me, go busy yourselves,\u201d Lu Sheng said casually.But how would the store owner dare to leave? He was not the real owner of this store in the first place, but rather an acting one\u2014he was merely the general steward in charge of the entire Fine Treasures Hall. One day, he had suddenly received a message from above that Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s External Head Lu was coming to his branch to pick out some items. Instantly, he hurried over from his house to welcome Lu Sheng.Silently, he motioned for the two employees to move away. He himself retreated several steps, remaining behind to await possible orders.One by one, Lu Sheng cast the artifacts aside. Before long, he had completely gone through all the ten over items in the first crate. Not a single drop of Yin Qi could be found among them.But that was to be expected. Yin Qi could be stored in objects but dissipated quickly. Objects that prevented Yin Qi from dissipating were extremely rare.Lu Sheng walked to the second box, squatted down, and continued looking through them.One by one, the objects were taken out and cast aside. Halfway through the box, Lu Sheng abruptly paused in his motion. In his hands was a gold-threaded red jade bangle. Ignoring the black mud stains on it, he held it up to his eye to scrutinize it.Threads of cold Yin Qi poured unceasingly from the bangle into Lu Sheng\u2019s hand.He examined the bangle and found a small line of fine words on it.\u2018Where art thou, Nine Phoenixes of the clear stream?\u2019\u201cWhere did this bangle come from?\u201d He picked it up and asked the owner.\u201cIn reply to Master\u2019s question, these objects were all gathered from independent contractors. As for which of them specifically, we\u2019re not sure either,\u201d the store owner replied with difficulty.\u201cFine, then. It\u2019s alright,\u201d Lu Sheng placed the jade bangle by his side and continued flipping through the remaining objects.This time, he was no longer as lucky; none of the remaining objects carried Yin Qi within them.Lu Sheng picked up the gold-threaded jade bangle and stood up.\u201cI\u2019ll take this bangle. Name a price.\u201dThe owner took the bangle and looked at it.\u201cSince Master Lu is willing to patronize us, we\u2019ll just charge the base price\u2014twenty taels.\u201dLu Sheng handed over silver notes worth twenty taels, took the bangle, and left the rear hall.\u201cShould new stock arrive in the future, remember to notify me,\u201d he instructed the store owner before leaving.\u201cRest assured, I will, I will!\u201d The store owner plastered on a wide smile as he replied.Carrying the jade bangle, Lu Sheng hailed a carriage and headed straight back to the greenhouse.All the way back, the jade bangle was unceasingly pouring Yin Qi into Lu Sheng\u2019s body.Back in the greenhouse, he returned to his room to rest. After instructing that he was not to be disturbed, he closed the doors.Lu Sheng sat and poured the tea from the teapot over the bangle to clean it, then he used a handkerchief to wipe it dry. Instantly, the jade bangle turned bright and clean.Under light, the red jade shone with the rich color of blood.By then, almost all the Yin Qi in the bangle had been absorbed by Lu Sheng.\u2018Deep Blue!\u2019The Modifier flashed into existence before Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes.He focused on the area behind his martial arts boxes. Thankfully, there were selections after most of his martial arts, with the sole exception of Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill.He looked again at Ultimate Crimson Mantra. There was also a button after his Level Six Ultimate Crimson Mantra! Apparently, the Yin Qi absorbed this time was sufficient to upgrade it by one level.\u2018Begin martial arts extrapolation?\u2019 The Modifier\u2019s enquiry appeared again.\u2018Yes,\u2019 Lu Sheng thought for a moment before deciding. The enquiry box disappeared. He quickly zoomed in on Ultimate Crimson Mantra. The button after it was still there.\u2018In order to counteract Bind poison, the only thing that works is inner force of Yang-attribute. Ultimate Crimson Mantra has got to be my priority for upgrading. It\u2019s also my main weapon against the supernatural.\u2019Having made up his mind, he quickly focused and pressed on the button behind Ultimate Crimson Mantra.\u201cSwish.\u201dOnce the button was pressed, the Modifier screen blurred and swiftly came into focus again. The words on it had changed as well. \u2018Ultimate Crimson Mantra: Level Seven. Special Effect(s): Blood Web, Intensified Fire Poison, Six-Fold Tremor, Intensified Incendiary.\u2019\u2018Blood web\u2026 indeed, as I expected,\u2019 Lu Sheng was seized with excitement.According to the manual, after attaining pinnacle mastery of Ultimate Crimson Mantra, all inner Qi in the body will form an unceasing cycle and firepower will reach the maximum. As a natural result, a network of inner Qi will form a layer that covers the entire body\u2019s skin.This was the \u2018blood web\u2019 mentioned in the manual.As for how powerful this blood web was, Lu Sheng was in the dark. Although he sensed that his cultivation force was rapidly inflating and expanding, he did not really detect many other, finer changes.Once again, he opened the white box and took out a porcelain vial from within. Pulling out the stopper, he gently poured a drop of black liquid into his palm.\u201cSzzzz\u2026.\u201dWhite smoke wafted up into the air and the stink of rotten flesh spread out.Lu Sheng could clearly see the black liquid shaking and trembling in his palm, as if it had been dripped onto a boiling pot. Swiftly, it shrank as it evaporated, then finally disappeared thoroughly.\u2018One drop is a piece of cake now. Took me only three breaths to completely nullify it,\u2019 Lu Sheng felt for the consumption of inner Qi. \u2018The quality of Ultimate Crimson Qi has also risen. It took only twenty percent of my inner force to achieve the same results as previously. So, although it seems like there wasn\u2019t much increase in volume, in actual fact my real cultivation base has expanded up to four times! It is indeed the pinnacle realm of Ultimate Crimson Mantra, after all.Let\u2019s try the blood web now,\u2019 Lu Sheng stood up and activated all his inner force.Immediately, he detected an invisible layer of inner Qi web emerging on his skin, protecting every inch of skin on his body.\u2018Interesting,\u2019 he lifted his index finger and slowly extended it towards the tabletop.When his finger was an inch away from the table top, Lu Sheng felt as if something was obstructing his progress in front of his fingertip and it was unable to continue.Moreover, this thing felt like cotton, extremely bouncy. He could press forward for a bit, but still could not touch the tabletop.\u201cSzzzz\u2026.\u201dSuddenly, the table top was lit up in flames. The flames rapidly spread across the entire tablecloth.\u2018Although it provides a certain defense and even carries fire poison attribute within it, its temperature is too low and it burns too slowly. I had to touch the tablecloth for a few breaths before I could light it in flames\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng picked up the teapot and poured its contents out on the tabletop, immediately extinguishing the sparks of fire.\u2018Against mortals, ordinary experts, this blood web is indeed extremely effective. I just need to wear a set of animal hide armor. With this layer of blood web as a buffer, any attacks, no matter how strong, can be slowed and reduced in strength.But against ghosts, this won\u2019t be enough. I\u2019ve gotta continue strengthening it!Oh yes, Changing the Heavens in Seven Days Saber Technique also releases a web-like Qi force. Perhaps the two can stack?\u2019 Lu Sheng quickly checked the Ultimate Crimson Mantra manual.It was a pity that according to the manual, Changing the Heavens in Seven Days merely imitated the special effect of Level Seven of Ultimate Crimson Mantra to create a weaker version of it. Now that he already possessed a Level Seven cultivation base, Changing the Heavens in Seven Days seemed a little useless.\u2018Well, I happen to have a Grade A, Third Class contribution merit that allows me to pick a martial art I like. Grade A contribution should probably be enough for me to choose one of the best inner force mantras, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Lu Sheng thought helplessly.Even if he had attained pinnacle mastery of Ultimate Crimson Mantra, reaching the heights achieved by former Crimson Sun Sect Chiefs, that was barely enough for him to resist merely half the poison in the power of Bind, according to the samples he had in the porcelain vials.Lu Sheng surmised that the level of difficulty in resisting the poison in Bind was proportionate to its defensive power.If that was the case, then even if he were to expend all his inner force at maximum power, he had to double it at the very least to break through the defensive barrier of Bind.\u201cExternal Head! Sect Master has orders for the entire upper management to assemble in the Crimson Whale!\u201dJade Lotus\u2019 voice rang out from outside all of a sudden.\u201cThe entire upper management?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cDid he say why?\u201d\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Jade Lotus was frustrated too. He was, after all, not considered a part of upper management. He had the capability, but was lacking in cultivation and needed more training. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be out of the loop now.\u201cI understand. I\u2019m coming out now. It just so happens that I need to make a trip to the headquarters anyway.\u201dLu Sheng kept the porcelain vial into the box and kept the box under his bed before tidying his robes and opening the door.\u201cThe horse has been prepared. External Head, please take better care of it. A good horse costs a hefty sum. Nobody can stomach that kind of losses if you keep losing your mounts,\u201d Jade Lotus reminded Lu Sheng helplessly. All the horses that Lu Sheng rode out on had always landed up missing. As a result, the Mountain-Edge City branch was left without a single good horse.\u201cGot it,\u201d Lu Sheng chuckled. He left the house and a disciple immediately led a healthy maroon horse to him.\u201cOh, and tonight you may retrieve Lu Chenxin\u2019s corpse. It\u2019s time, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He suddenly asked in recollection.\u201cIt is,\u201d Jade Lotus nodded. For some reason, the present Lu Sheng looked like a different man to him, compared to previously.If the External Head had been a dangerous beast, then presently, he gave off a particular gravitas and stillness, stable and heavy like a mountain.\u201cHave it sent here first then. I\u2019ll deliver it back personally,\u201d Lu Sheng ordered. Regardless, he had to give his family some closure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Send it straight to Mountain-Edge City. I\u2019ll head there directly too,\u201d Lu Sheng changed his mind.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u201cSee to the other arrangements. I\u2019m heading to the headquarters first,\u201d Lu Sheng relayed his instructions and made a dash on the horse towards the Crimson Whale.He made no stops along the way. Still, by the time he arrived at the Crimson Whale, many high-ranking External Heads and Internal Affairs Emissaries had already arrived.Crowd milled about in the harbor, including even some people from nearby sects and clans.Lu Sheng had only just arrived when sect disciples dressed in red came to greet him and take care of his horse.\u201cWhy\u2019re there so many people today?\u201d Lu Sheng asked with a frown, staring straight ahead.In front of him was a company of men who had just arrived, bearing the flag of Eastern Mountain Society. At the head of the company was a white-bearded old man, who was whispering to the sect disciples leading them.\u201cOld Sect Master has issued the order for a grand assembly. All distinguished persons in the region will be coming to the Crimson Whale today,\u201d the disciple whispered in reply.Lu Sheng flipped himself off his horse and boarded the Crimson Whale from its side. The front was way too crowded for him to enter that way. The number of different groups waiting to board from the front alone was at least five. Due to the inspections that needed to be carried out, progress was slow.\u201cOrder for a grand assembly? What on earth happened?\u201d Lu Sheng asked further.\u201cThis subordinate is unaware as well,\u201d that disciple shook his head.Lu Sheng spoke no further. His brows locked together in a furrow as apprehension mounted in his heart.After boarding the ship, he made a beeline for the central great hall. Before he got near, he could already hear a loud buzz and commotion from within.He walked along the corridor and into the great hall. What greeted his eyes was a sea of assorted flags belonging to different sects, clans, and societies.The great hall was also filled with representatives of other factions.Old Sect Master sat at the head of all. Beside him was Chen Ying and the External and Internal Affairs Emissaries, as well as Elder Wang, Elder Ouyang, and all the rest of the elders.Seated beneath them were the two societies\u2014She Lin Society and Eastern Mountain Society. Their representatives had arrived as well. The seats belonging to both societies were occupied by distinguished men and women.After them were representatives of the three clans\u2014Transformation Clan, Unity Path Clan, and Mountain Tiger Clan. The entire great hall was a sea of commotion and din.Lu Sheng looked at the old Sect Master. Hong Mingzi also caught sight of him and nodded at him, motioning him over to take a seat.Lu Sheng noticed that a young man sat on Hong Mingzi\u2019s left. He was a young person who looked calm and composed.This man was clearly sitting beside the Sect Master of Crimson Whale Sect, but was dressed in plain gray robes with a decorated sword strapped to his back. He had no airs to speak of about him, as if he was merely a common teacher in a school or the owner of a random bookstore. There was only a multifarious and mild aura around him.Lu Sheng narrowed his eyes, then strode near.\u201cJunior Apprentice Brother, sit by my side,\u201d Hong Mingzi said softly, pointing at the seat on his right after Chen Ying.Chen Ying was Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s second-in-command. For Lu Sheng to be granted a seat right after him, it clearly meant that Lu Sheng was the third highest ranking person in Crimson Whale Sect.Lu Sheng did not stand on ceremony. He strode over and sat down like a boss.\u201cSenior Apprentice Brother, what happened? Why the order for a grand assembly?\u201dHong Mingzi forced a trace of a smile on his face as he introduced the young man beside him, \u201cThis is the person in charge of handling the situation right now, dispatched by the Zhen Family\u2014Young Master Zhen Xun.\u201dHe turned his head and whispered to the young man, \u201cYoung Master Zhen Xun, this is this old man\u2019s junior apprentice brother, Lu Sheng. Presently, my junior apprentice brother\u2019s skills can rank among the top three in Crimson Whale Sect.\u201dThe young man nodded peaceably at Lu Sheng without a word.Instantly, Lu Sheng realized who that person was.Zhen Xun!The current leader of Zhen Family\u2019s team. A legendary Nobleman. Moreover, given his ability to lead other Noblemen from the Zhen Family, he must be a big shot among Noblemen.Lu Sheng clasped his hands together at him with a respectful face. Zhen Xun merely nodded in acknowledgment.Such a gesture was within expectation for someone of his identity.Not bothered by it, Lu Sheng sat down without saying a word. After all, in Zhen Xun\u2019s eyes, he was but a leader in Crimson Whale Sect, a dime a dozen under Zhen Family\u2019s command. It was already very polite of him to have looked at him in the eyes.Thereafter, more members of Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s upper management arrived. Each time someone strong arrived, Hong Mingzi would introduce them to Zhen Xun one by one. The high and mighty Nobleman showed no impatience; his manner remained peaceable and mild.After realizing who he was, all the members of the upper management sat on the edge of their seats, as if they were facing a formidable foe, shaking with trepidation at the thought of upsetting him. The atmosphere turned awkward.After nearly an hour, all personnel from Crimson Whale Sect had been introduced. The representatives and leaders from the other sects were present as well. The great hall\u2019s doors gradually swung shut. Hong Mingzi lifted his arms.\u201cBoom!!!\u201dA deep drumbeat reverberated in the hall.\u201cSILENCE!\u201d Hong Mingzi projected his voice.The cacophony in the great hall died in a matter of seconds. Each faction\u2019s leader kept his or her subordinates in line and all their gazes were directed to the front.\u201cOld Sect Master Hong, ever since Crimson Whale Sect received the authority to call for a grand assembly more than ten years ago, this is the second time you\u2019ve used it. Have you invited us here regarding the recent chaos outside the city?\u201d Eastern Mountain Society\u2019s Deputy Chairman asked loudly from his seat.\u201cIndeed. There\u2019s been no lack of trouble in the Northern Lands recently. All sorts of peculiar cases have been happening without end, threatening to rip us apart with panic. That\u2019s not a good sign! As the dragon head of the Northern Lands, can Crimson Whale Sect suggest any measures to stabilize the situation?\u201d She Lin Society\u2019s Chairman asked loudly.The rest of those present nodded in approval. Indeed, the recent events have culminated in large losses for the various factions. Unidentified deaths have increased greatly as well. Even the citizens inside Mountain-Edge City lived in fear now, not to mention those outside the city.Although everyone tried to live on as if nothing had happened, the clear-headed ones could tell that the situation had completely spiraled out of control.Hong Mingzi coughed twice, then waved his arms to gesture for silence.\u201cIndeed, you are right. The situation in the Northern Lands has recently been getting out of hand. Hence, we Crimson Whale Sect have invited all of you here to address this matter.\u201dHe stretched out his hand towards Zhen Xun beside him.\u201cThis Young Master Zhen Xun has come precisely to defuse the situation.\u201dZhen Xun?!Like magic, the name rapidly spread across the lips of the top brains in the room. The originally impatient crowd\u2019s faces changed when they heard his name. Except for some newly emerged experts who were perplexed, none of the rest was ignorant of Zhen Family\u2019s name.Silence quickly descended onto the room. Some among them who had committed affairs that they felt guilty about found cold sweat breaking out on their backs, unsure if this Young Master from Zhen Family would call them about it.Smiling, Zhen Xun rose slowly.He surveyed the hall, satisfied with the power and impact caused by his name.\u201cLadies and gentlemen,\u201d he may not have had grand airs but his voice rang clearly across the hall; all of them could hear him. \u201cI represent the Zhen Family and would like all of you present to assist me in two matters.\u201dHe stood. Everyone in the hall, including Hong Mingzi, immediately stood up as well.\u201cOur greetings to Young Master Zhen Xun! May\u2026 may we know what Young Master requires of us?\u201d Eastern Mountain Society\u2019s Deputy Chairperson said respectfully and nervously. His question echoed what was on everyone\u2019s mind.Zhen Xun smiled, \u201cI want all factions\u2014all personnel\u2014to search for all forces associated with the Scarlet District.\u201d\u201cScarlet District?\u201d Shock flashed across Hong Mingzi\u2019s face.\u201cThat\u2019s right. \u2018Scarlet\u2019 as in the color. \u2018District\u2019 as in a subdivision of a city. They\u2019re the true source of the present chaos,\u201d Zhen Xun nodded. \u201cAdditionally, I want a name list containing all distinguished persons who have recently entered the five major cities. All foreigners with features that are out of the ordinary must also be recorded on the list.\u201dThat was an extremely massive undertaking. The five major cities were the five largest cities in Northern Lands, including Mountain-Edge City. These large cities saw an inestimably large traffic flowing through them every day. To filter out those with features out of the ordinary was like finding a needle in a haystack.Standing by the side, Lu Sheng gradually realized what Zhen Xun was doing. He was borrowing the intelligence network of mortal organizations to screen and fish out all potential enemies.\u201cSince this is Young Master Zhen Xun\u2019s request, we will certainly get it done!\u201d She Lin Society\u2019s Chairman was the first to express assent. The rest of the leaders quickly followed suit.Who among those seated on the high seats here were not well-informed individuals? Zhen Family was the true ruler of the Northern Lands, as well as Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s backer. That was old news to all.Every year, Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s immense revenue would be wiped out cleanly. That was because it was all offered as tribute to Zhen Family.\u201cSince all of you understand what I\u2019ve said, then I\u2019ll entrust the gathering of intelligence to Crimson Whale Sect. After a period of time, I\u2019ll send someone here to check on the progress. Any problems?\u201d Zhen Xun\u2019s gaze swept across the hall.\u201cWe will certainly obey Young Master\u2019s orders!\u201d Hong Mingzi was the first to reply, a standard lackey-smile on his face.Lu Sheng was speechless. This was the first time he had seen his senior apprentice brother behaving in this manner. No wonder he was the Sect Master of the number one sect\u2014he knew his place.\u201cWe will obey!\u201d The rest of the factions did not dare to differ.Zhen Xun briefed them on what sort of people to look out for before strolling out, hands behind his back. Before long, he was riding away on a Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s horse.The hastily arranged grand assembly was dismissed just like that.None among the leaders at the meeting left feeling as relaxed as they did when they had come. Each one of them looked heavy-hearted, ready to comply with Zhen Family\u2019s orders to arrange for eyes everywhere.Lu Sheng was about to leave too when he was asked to stay by the old Sect Master.\u201cSenior Apprentice Brother, why have you specially asked me to stay back?\u201dIn the Sect Master\u2019s library, Hong Mingzi sent everyone else away, leaving Lu Sheng alone in the room with him.\u201cJunior Apprentice Brother, a great change is coming. You must prepare yourself for it,\u201d Hong Mingzi said to Lu Sheng gravely.\u201cA great change?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s face turned solemn as well. Old Sect Master must have had a good reason to stop him.\u201cYes,\u201d Hong Mingzi nodded. \u201cFor over twenty years, I\u2019ve been in contact with Zhen Family. They have always responded decisively, even brutally. They\u2019ve always been steady and thorough\u2014that\u2019s their style. But this time, something is off. Young Master Zhen Xun isn\u2019t doing things like how Zhen Family used to. I have a nasty premonition about it.\u201d\u201cSenior Apprentice Brother, are you certain?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s expression became grave at the news as well.\u201cI\u2019m certain. Zhen Family\u2019s moving too hastily this time,\u201d Hong Mingzi continued. \u201cOf course, it may be that I\u2019m being oversuspicious. But it never hurts to be prepared. Junior Apprentice Brother, you must be cautious. Zhen Family\u2026 seems unstable\u2026\u201d\u201cGot it\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s heart turned heavy.***He departed after visiting the library. All the way back, his mind was on this matter.Given Hong Mingzi\u2019s personality, he would not tell him these things out of the blue. He, Lu Sheng, had come from a decent and clean family and entered Crimson Sun Sect. He was his junior apprentice brother and his personality and character were transparent to all. It was natural for Hong Mingzi to drop him some special hints.He was truly treating him as family.\u2018Zhen Family is unstable\u2026 if I need to make preparations, what should I do?\u2019 The matter pressed heavily on Lu Sheng\u2019s mind.In the Northern Lands, the Zhen Family was the one carrying the fight against the dark supernatural forces. They enjoyed all the wealth and resources that the Northern Lands had to offer; in exchange, they provided the Northern Lands with security.Once this massive protective shield fell, the ensuing trouble wouldn\u2019t be just trouble\u2026 it would be hell.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

We\u2019ll take it one step at a time. If Zhen Family really loses the fight, then perhaps a big city like Mountain-Edge City is the safest place to be.The government\u2019s backing is the Emperor\u2019s family. The Emperor\u2019s family must be powerful enough for it to rule over such a large territory, even if only in name. When the time comes, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to hide in Mountain-Edge City. Moreover, senior apprentice brother surely has a contingency plan in mind.\u2019Lu Sheng thought no further on that subject and rode at full pelt towards the moat.\u2018The only thing I can do now is to quickly gather as many items with Yin Qi as I can to upgrade my skill! The safest policy is to depend only on myself for safety.\u2019He hurried back into the city through the night. His subordinates in Crimson Whale Sect had already moved the corpse into a pharmacy in the city owned by the sect.He made a beeline for the corpse and finally saw Lu Chenxin and a few other corpses in the backyard of the pharmacy.\u201cSwish\u2026\u201dLu Sheng unveiled the white cloth and could not help but step back, covering his nose with his hand.A sharp acrid, rotten stench gushed at him, as disgusting as if he had licked the filth stuck on the walls of the gutter with his tongue. Beside him, the sect disciples similarly covered their noses, looks of disgust on their faces.Lying in the coffin, Lu Chenxin\u2019s head looked as if it has been slashed by a knife, leaving only the segment under his eyes. The segment with his forehead was missing. His limbs were like shriveled branches, black and dry.More importantly, his torso was highly decomposed. Worms and maggots crawled all over his skin. On some areas, mold had grown and pus oozed out. The different odors mixed in the air to form a choking stench.\u201cHas the corpse been moved?\u201d Lu Sheng frowned.\u201cNo, sir! We put him into the coffin the way we found him. We didn\u2019t move him at all,\u201d Ning San replied on the side.\u201cMen, cover it up. Lift it and follow me,\u201d Lu Sheng instructed.The sect disciples hurried forward to close the coffin. The stench thinned significantly after the coffin was sealed and everybody could finally suck in a deep breath of air.\u201cLet\u2019s go. To Lu Manor,\u201d it had been a long time since he last felt that the situation was so dire.***Lu Manor.In the brightly lit backyard, blood-curdling cries rang out incessantly.\u201cMy son! You\u2019ve died such a tragic death~~!\u201d Wang Yanyu sat on the ground, her hands waving in the air melodramatically. Tears and mucus flew all over from her and her robes were messy.Around her, many of both the younger and the older generation were gathered. Lu Tianyang, Lu Yingying, as well as many distant relatives were all present. There was more than twenty of them.Lu Quanan sat aside, his face, neck and arms covered in streaks of blood caused by scratches.\u201cWang Yanyu! What are you going crazy over! So many elders and juniors are here staring at you. Have you any shame?\u201d Fury filled his heart. He felt like vomiting blood.\u201cMy son is gone\u2026 GONE! I\u2019ve got no more hope, Lu Quanan! You still have two sons though you lost one. But I\u2019ve got only one! Only ONE son!!!\u201d Wang Yanyu cried.\u201cChenxin\u2019s my son too. I\u2019m equally sad as you that he\u2019s gone missing! But there\u2019s so many of us in the Lu Family, old and young. A few dozens of us. We can\u2019t possibly stop living on because of Chenxin, can we? How can you face Little Hong? How can you face Tianyang!?\u201dLu Quanan clutched his chest in grief and pain.\u201cSo what? How\u2019s it fair that my son is gone, yet Lu Tianyang lives on? They live in the same house. How\u2019s it fair? Old Master, tell me! How\u2019s it fair!? Wang Yanyu\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and swollen like peaches, venom undisguised in them.Lu Quanan had no words in reply. Indeed, Lu Tianyang and Lu Chenxin shared the same house. How was it that Lu Chenxin had gone missing, yet Tianyang was completely fine?\u201cSee! See! Don\u2019t you have anything to say? Hehehe\u2026 Lu Quanan, when I married you, what did you promise me? When you wanted to screw me on the bed, you sounded so sweet. You said that as long as I was willing, you would give our son an inheritance and name\u2026 in the end? In the end?!\u201d Wang Yanyu turned increasingly hysterical. \u201cMy son is gone\u2026 gone\u2026 can you still give me another son? Can you?? HAHAHAHA!!! Why don\u2019t I look for Big Bro and let him screw me? Maybe I can still get a new son! Or any man around. You!\u201dShe rose to her feet and tugged at a middle-aged man on the side.\u201cSteward Zhao, haven\u2019t you always been stealing glances at me? Do you want to screw me? Come on! Here! Right here! I\u2019ll let you screw me!!! Ha\u2026 hahahahha!!!\u201dThe man\u2019s face turned as red as beetroot. He tried to wrestle free, but could not pry her grip off his robe. The guards wanted to intervene, but dared not for fear of hurting Wang Yanyu.Momentarily, the entire backyard was locked in tension.\u201cBOOM!\u201d\u201cWHERE\u2019S YOUR DECORUM!\u201d Lu Sheng strode into the backyard, his face ugly. On both his sides, Crimson Whale Sect disciples rushed in, forming two lines.\u201cPry her away!\u201d He glared at the hysterical Wang Yanyu.Two men immediately stepped up and pulled away Wang Yanyu, who was cackling in laughter maniacally.Scratched all over his face, Lu Quanan fell to his butt on the side, sighing.\u201cYo! Isn\u2019t this our high and mighty Eldest Young Master? You\u2019ve been living in Mountain-Edge City all by yourself for so long, but no accidents have happened to you\u2026\u201d Wang Yanyu giggled, unbothered by the fact that she was being restrained.\u201cPIAK.\u201dLu Sheng delivered a slap right across Wang Yanyu\u2019s face, flinging her face to the side forcefully. Shocked and dazed, she turned dumb.\u201cThird Mistress is tired. Take her to rest. Shut the doors tight.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201d Two housemen hurried forward, took Wang Yanyu, and dragged her away.With the respected Eldest Young Master Lu Sheng\u2019s command, coupled with the sect disciples he brought with him, the situation was firmly brought under control. Even Wang Yanyu was dealt with and taken away.Lu Sheng looked at his Old Dad Lu Quanan and sighed. He had grown old and lacked the resolve to deal with his pillow mate, resulting in the embarrassing turn of events.\u201cSheng\u2019er\u2026\u201d Lu Quanan sighed. In that moment, he seemed to age by a few years.Lu Sheng glanced at Lu Tianyang as well as Fourth Mother Lu Hong, who was also Lu Tianyang\u2019s mother.This poor mother was presently hugging her son\u2019s arm tightly, tears welling up in her eyes.\u201cBrother Sheng. Wang Yanyu, she\u2026 she poisoned Tianyang\u2019s supper!\u201d The tears in Lu Hong\u2019s eyes were finally uncontainable. They flowed down her cheeks.\u201cShe\u2019s so heartless\u2026\u201d she sobbed.Lu Tianyang\u2019s face was pale, his breath rising up and down messily. He stood dumbly on the spot, allowing his mother to hug him.\u201cEnough!\u201d Lu Sheng snorted coldly. \u201cCrying and sobbing all day. Where\u2019s your decorum?!\u201dInstantly, Lu Hong shook with fear, not daring to cry any further.\u201cAll of you, disperse now! Lu Tianyang, Uncle Zhao, Steward Zhao, stay behind. Squad A, stand guard outside. The rest of you, go back! Get back to whatever you were supposed to be doing!\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze swept around the backyard, his eyes cold and sharp. Apart from Uncle Zhao, all who met his gaze averted it, bowing their heads.Presently, he had a thicker aura of might and power about him. Coupled with his muscular and huge stature, and perhaps because he had taken many lives, he naturally carried with him an air of ferocity and savagery. Once he turned fierce, the average person would lose even the courage to meet his gaze.At his order, everyone hurried out of the backyard, leaving behind only a small group of people.Very soon, the door to the backyard was shut. Outside the doors, Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s men stood guard. Only then did he found out from Lu Quanan what had happened.It turns out that after waiting for such a long period of time, Wang Yanyu sensed that her son Lu Chenxin had likely come to a nasty end. Moreover, Lu Quanan had long since lost his reproductive ability. Without an heir, she was filled with despair and venom.This led her to lace Lu Tianyang\u2019s supper with lethal Rubber Flower Poison. Thankfully, she was found out by Uncle Zhao while he was doing his rounds.After listening to what had happened, Lu Sheng fell into silence.\u201cThis matter\u2026 no one could have seen it coming. Chenxin has indeed met with his demise. I\u2019ve recovered his corpse\u2026\u201d\u201cFound it???\u201d Lu Quanan was dazed.Aside, Uncle Zhao sighed as well. The rest of them including Lu Tianyang bowed their heads wordlessly.\u201cHe\u2019s right outside. But he\u2019s a nasty sight. Dad, you guys can go take a look,\u201d Lu Sheng whispered.Lu Quanan fell silent for a moment. After a few seconds, he said coarsely, a shudder in his voice,\u201cLet\u2019s go take a look together\u2026\u201d\u201cWait till Third Mother has calmed down before telling her about this,\u201d Lu Sheng reminded.\u201cMm,\u201d Lu Quanan agreed and no longer spoke.The company of men left the backyard and went out of Lu Manor\u2019s side entrance. In an alley nearby, a giant black coffin was placed.Lu Sheng had his men open the lid of the coffin so they could peer inside.Lu Quanan went forward and took a look. Before a few breaths\u2019 span, tears streaked across his face as he turned aside and vomited.Lu Tianyang, Uncle Zhao, and the rest went up to take a look as well. Each of them stepped back in disgust and some of them could not help but vomit as well.\u201cAi\u2026\u201d Uncle Zhao sighed. \u201cBrother Sheng, I can tell you\u2019ve established some foundation for yourself in Mountain-Edge City. Can you investigate who did this to Young Master Chenxin?\u201dAt this question, Lu Quanan and the rest all turned to look at Lu Sheng.They had only just arrived in Mountain-Edge City and did not recognize Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s insignia. They merely assumed that Lu Sheng must have met with favorable circumstances.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say\u2026\u201d naturally, Lu Sheng knew who was the murderer. But what use was there even if he told his family?\u201cHow about the authorities?\u201d A look of pain appeared on Lu Quanan\u2019s face. \u201cIs there any use in reporting this matter to the authorities?\u201dLu Sheng did not reply.Lu Quanan suddenly understood what this answer meant. Unlike Uncle Zhao and Lu Tianyang, he had been one of those involved in Nine Links City\u2019s closed-door discussion among the city\u2019s elites. Naturally, he knew about many secrets\u2014including information about ghosts.Looking at Chenxin\u2019s corpse, he roughly understood how complicated the situation was. It didn\u2019t seem like a human had done this to his corpse\u2026\u201cYou guys\u2026 should not have come to Mountain-Edge City at this time\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng sighed slowly.\u201cIt\u2019s not that we wished to. Rather, we had no choice but to\u2026\u201d Lu Quanan sighed. \u201cNine Links City isn\u2019t safe\u2026 and it\u2019s gotten much quieter. Many people have left and businesses are closing down. We\u2019ve got so many to take care of\u2026 so many employees needing to be hired. With our dwindling numbers, we can\u2019t even plow the land.\u201dLu Sheng understood the difficult situation his Old Dad was in.The huge explosion in Nine Links City had taken its toll on the city and it was unable to recover from it. This severely weakened Lu Family that depended greatly on Nine Links City. If the situation was allowed to continue, the family would fall into poverty and ruin. Hence, he had set his mind on relocating.\u201cSince you\u2019ve come, then let\u2019s settle down first. Old Dad, have you decided which industry to enter?\u201d He asked. As a member of Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s highest management, it would be a waste if he did not use his power to take as much care as he could of his family.\u201cNo idea yet. We\u2019ll have to take a look first,\u201d Lu Quanan replied helplessly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Outside the city, even peasants don\u2019t dare to travel too far away from the city. Large plots of land are left unploughed. No matter how much grain has been stored, there\u2019ll come a day when it\u2019s finished. There\u2019ll probably be a famine next year,\u201d Lu Sheng said softly.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll go back and begin making preparations\u2026\u201d Lu Quanan shut his eyes, not wishing to continue the topic any further. At the end of the day, Lu Chenxin was his son. The kind of feeling he had from looking at his son\u2019s corpse was not something that Lu Sheng could understand.Sensing his Old Dad\u2019s reticence, Lu Sheng did not disturb him any longer. He led the Crimson Whale Sect disciples away from the Manor.Mountain-Edge City remained gloriously splendid at night. The night market on the streets made them look like rivers of light, slowly moving a huge number of stall carts, lanterns and oil lamps along.It was a spectacle of prosperity, without any hint of the recent troubles at all.Lu Sheng rode gradually along the street. Looking at the commotion and liveliness of the crowd around him, a wave of fatigue suddenly washed over him.\u2018Ever since coming into this world, I\u2019ve been laboring day and night to become stronger, practicing martial arts to fight against the supernatural. If I had not entered this world, Lu Family would probably be like Big Brother Xu\u2019s family by now, wiped out and sacrificed completely,\u2019 Lu Sheng stared into the area in front of him, to his right. A boy received a small round wooden drum from his mother, shaking it in high spirits to produce crisp beats.\u2018Even if the people in this world remain in the dark and completely defenseless, they continue working hard to live on, like wild grass,\u2019 Lu Sheng\u2019s face was impassive. \u2018But they\u2019re merely surviving.\u2019Passing by the little boy, he saw a group of drunk Institution students singing ahead of him. Three sheets to the wind, each of them yelled with abandon, shocking passers-by into forming a wide space around them.\u201cHahaha, a thousand cups leave none drunk, a thousand scrolls leave one erudite! Brother Chen! Brother Song! Again!\u201d A student lifted his empty hand as if a wine cup was within, baring his chest and completely oblivious to the annoyed glares of passers-by.The rest of them roared in laughter and joined in the ruckus.\u201cMiss Hong\u2019er\u2019s really got some kick! Next time\u2026 burp\u2026 I\u2019ll still choose her!\u201d The company laughed again.Lu Sheng glanced at them, then rode slowly past them. On both sides of him, Crimson Whale disciples followed closely. Wherever they went, people hastily kept away from them.Those moving in his style were the embodiment of people whom average people cannot afford to mess with.After traveling a distance further, Lu Sheng suddenly pulled on his reins, slowing the horse to a halt, and looked at a small stall selling glutinous rice balls by the side.At a small table in the corner, two dirty and ragged beggars sat prim and proper.The two of them cut a peculiar sight. They were clearly beggars who were covered all over in filth with hair as messy as a hen\u2019s nest and bodies shrunken to the bones. Yet they sat with impeccable posture and bearing on their seats, their backs as straight as pine trees.Lu Sheng stared at the two of them with narrowed eyes, waving his hand to gesture his subordinates into halting.He alighted from his horse and let his men lead the horse away. Then he strolled towards the stall and sat.\u201cThis Master, what sort of glutinous rice ball would you like?\u201d Seeing that Lu Sheng had an extraordinary air about him, the stall owner hurried over to serve him with a wide grin.\u201cAnything. Give me the same as what they\u2019re having,\u201d Lu Sheng pointed at the two beggars.The stall owner was a middle aged-man. After hearing Lu Sheng, his face turned awkward,\u201cSir, you must be joking. Those two lads are eating what\u2019s made of leftover materials in my stall. They\u2019re not eating good glutinous rice balls\u2026\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t they paying for their food?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good one. Where will these two kids find money from?\u201d The stall owner chuckled as he shook his head. \u201cThese two girls have been wandering nearby for many days, picking rotten vegetables and bones that have been thrown away for food. I was moved with pity for them.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s kind-hearted of you. Are they foreigners?\u201d Lu Sheng looked at the two beggars. He had noticed that the owner called them \u201cthese two girls\u201d.\u201cDon\u2019t they seem so? They\u2019re refugees who escaped from famine elsewhere. But both kids have got integrity. I told them I\u2019m giving the food to them for free, but they rejected. It took me a while to persuade them. In the end, I had to tell them that I was selling it to them but was allowing them to pay back in the future. Only then were they willing to eat,\u201d the stall owner shook his head.\u201cSince they\u2019re girls, how can they still wander on the streets and not be abducted?\u201d Lu Sheng was surprised.\u201cErm\u2026 about that\u2026 you just have to look at their faces and you\u2019ll know,\u201d the stall owner replied helplessly.Lu Sheng asked no further and ordered a serving of meat-filled glutinous rice balls. Then he sat on his seat, looking at the two beggars.From the first instant he caught sight of them, he had sensed an aura off them that was different from that of average mortals.Though separated from him by more than ten meters, the aura on each of them was like a ball of fire in the dark night, clear as day, immediately attracting Lu Sheng\u2019s attention.They were two strands of faint, subtle Yin Qi.Such aura which apparently belonged only to ghosts was now emanating from two live beggars. Hence, Lu Sheng halted and came in to investigate.Remaining on his seat, he secretly eavesdropped on the conversation between the two beggar girls.\u201cSis, aren\u2019t you eating? If you don\u2019t eat, it\u2019s going to get cold,\u201d the shorter one among them whispered. Her voice was clear and crisp, like the sound of metal striking porcelain.\u201cI\u2019ve already eaten three. It\u2019s your turn,\u201d the taller among them\u2014the elder sister\u2014said. Her voice was hoarse, but discernibly feminine and carried within it a sense of calmness and composure.\u201cI\u2019ve calculated. A glutinous rice ball can last us for about eight hours. If we eat sparingly, together with the soup, we can go without vegetable leaves for several days.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to eat vegetable leaves again,\u201d the younger sister said.\u201cNeither do I. But we haven\u2019t got a choice,\u201d the elder sister replied.\u201cUp till today, we\u2019ve already owed favors from thirteen good Samaritans. I don\u2019t want to owe anyone anymore,\u201d the younger sister bent her head, about to take a bite, when she remarked.The elder sister fell into momentary silence.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m keeping tabs.\u201dThe two sisters had clearly fallen into destitution, yet continued to speak in a prim and proper way. They spoke more like children of cultured and educated families than like the ordinary folk, and behaved with principles. They treated a mere matter as simple as eating a bowl of glutinous rice balls as if it was some serious affair.Listening on the side, Lu Sheng\u2019s curiosity was piqued. He rose and walked to the table that the two beggars were at.\u201cListening to the both of you talking, you sound like literate people? Why don\u2019t you find a job as a scribe or letter writer?\u201dAt the interrupting voice, both sisters raised their heads towards him instantly. One look explained to Lu Sheng why they were in such pitiful straits.Blisters, packed densely together, filled their faces. These blisters covered their noses, mouths, eyelids, necks\u2026 etc. Practically every inch of their skin was covered in blisters. Only two narrow slits remained where their eyes were. A revolting stench emanated from their bodies, like the odor of rotting flesh.Lu Sheng also noticed that the blisters on the sides of their necks were slightly bigger than the rest. In the largest, he could even see some maggots wriggling.As if having noticed his gaze, the elder among the sisters covered her neck with her hands\u201cI want to get them out, but I can\u2019t get them out cleanly. It\u2019s very itchy.\u201dLu Sheng scrutinized the two of them. If not for the absence of Adam\u2019s apple and the faint swelling on their chests, Lu Sheng would not have been able to tell for certain that they were girls.\u201cDo you need assistance? I may be able to provide both of you with a job,\u201d he was very curious towards the two girls. It was the first time he had seen mortals with Yin Qi on them.\u201cReally?\u201d The younger sister rose immediately, staring at him.Beside her, her elder sister was in tremor too. She was clearly trying hard to suppress and contain her excitement.\u201cAs real as it gets,\u201d Lu Sheng nodded.\u201cWhat do you want us to do? We\u2019re literate, we can do basic sewing and knitting. We can even do laundry or cook or whatever,\u201d the younger sister shot off rapidly.\u201cDo you know gardening?\u201d A grin surfaced on Lu Sheng\u2019s face. \u201cWatering and fertilizing plants, trimming branches and leaves.\u201d\u201cYES!!!\u201dAlmost at the same time, the pair of sisters answered in unison, their eyes sparkling.***After bringing the two beggars back to Golden Jade Greenhouse and putting them to work, Lu Sheng spent his remaining time practicing Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill. Before that, he first exhausted all his Yin-Yang Jade Crane inner force.This time, he saw the effect immediately. Traces of faint numbness and itch spread all over the surface of his skin like heat waves. This was a characteristic sign of getting initiated into Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill.This also confirmed Lu Sheng\u2019s postulation about his conflicting skills. Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill was actually counter-productive when cultivating martial art skills that needed the body to be in a state of extremity. After this experience, he knew how to handle similar situations in the future.\u201cBAM! BAM! BAM BAM BAM!!!\u201dLu Sheng struck the lump of black iron before him in a series of continuous palm strikes.In the clearing in the greenhouse, a red pattern emerged on his forehead and his palms glowed crimson. Heat waves radiated outwards from his body. Within a two meter radius all around him, scorching wind raged in fury.\u201cHeart Shattering Palm!\u201dHis final palm strike landed dead in the center of the iron lump, causing it to tremor violently.\u201cBOOM!\u201dLu Sheng maintained his pose for a few seconds before slowly relaxing his hand.The iron lump remained pitch-black. But if one were to touch it, one would realize that the huge piece of metal was boiling hot.This was how Lu Sheng cultivated Ultimate Crimson Mantra. His Level Seven Ultimate Crimson Mantra was the pinnacle level of this inner force skill. There was no further progression to be achieved beyond it. He had no idea how to train his blood web. Hence, he came up with the idea of practicing it on a lump of iron.Each time he struck with his blood web, he had to ensure that the blood web formed by his inner Qi could envelope the entire lump of iron. Then he would burn and torch the entire lump of iron. This was to train both his precision and control over the blood web.The lump of iron was irregularly shaped and the height of a person. It was optimally suited for practicing the efficiency of the blood web against enemies of different shapes and forms as well as when cast from different angles.In his final strike, he activated Ultimate Crimson Mantra\u2019s Level Seven blood web with Heart Shattering Palm. The resulting effect satisfied Lu Sheng greatly.Under the enhancement of Ultimate Crimson Mantra, the might of Heart Shattering Palm, originally a mere Strength Proficiency martial art skill, drastically increased. The Tremor effect which accompanied his strike caused the entire iron lump to shake intensely. If he had not intentionally aimed downwards, the lump iron weighing several thousand kilograms might just fly backwards.\u201cExternal Head, it\u2019s meal time,\u201d Ning San said respectfully.\u201cMm,\u201d Lu Sheng nodded. He was now initiated into Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill and intended to try upgrading this hard body skill directly with the Modifier after heading back to his room. With Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill as foundation, there should not be any significant aftereffects to deal with. It was a Strength Proficiency external force skill, after all. Even if hard body skills were highly taxing, it was of too low a realm to pose much of a challenge.His purpose in cultivating Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill was also because it was a defensive martial art skill and could save his life at the crucial moment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He only instructed Ning San not to disturb him unless it was a matter of life and death.\u201cLord Jade Lotus goes to the headquarters once in a while for routine meetings. Everything else is the same. Nothing out of the ordinary for now. Once the situation changes, Crimson Whale will dispatch someone to notify you,\u201d Ning San replied.\u201cAs long as everything is in order. Oh, and how about the two beggar girls I brought home?\u201d Lu Sheng asked as he remembered them.\u201cI\u2019ve run a check. They\u2019re foreigners indeed. They\u2019ve been to Mountain-Edge City for less than a month. But, they\u2019re running the greenhouses really well. The greenhouses under their care are growing better than other greenhouses. They don\u2019t steal or laze around. They\u2019re of good character,\u201d Ning San smiled.\u201cObserve them closely. Once you detect any anomalies, inform me immediately,\u201d Lu Sheng sensed that the two of them always carried Yin Qi on them. He had taken them in only to observe how they were different from ordinary mortals.\u201cYes, sir.\u201dThe two of them exited the greenhouse and sat down in a gardener\u2019s hut beside it to wipe their sweat and rest.\u201cWhen we get back, take my command tablet and make a trip to our blacksmith store. I want to forge a fine weapon suited to myself. An average saber isn\u2019t suitable,\u201d Lu Sheng ordered.\u201cGot it. I\u2019ll send someone to notify the blacksmith store to prepare the materials later. Oh, and Lu Manor\u2019s funeral begins today,\u201d Ning San reminded.\u201cIt\u2019s Lu Chenxin\u2019s funeral?\u201d Lu Sheng sighed.\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Ning San whispered.\u201cI\u2019ll head back a little later,\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head. \u201cAny word from Fine Treasures Hall?\u201d\u201cNo, sir\u2026 but why won\u2019t External Head make a trip to the headquarters? I remember the Resident Elder Zhang Baiyu is an antiques collector. Also, the warehouse in the headquarters contains many of such excavated artifacts,\u201d Ning San asked.\u201cI\u2019ll go take a look later,\u201d Lu Sheng wolfed down his lunch. A huge tub of rice disappeared as if into a black hole in a matter of minutes.After lunch, Lu Sheng rose and headed straight to his bedroom.As he passed by a greenhouse, he spotted, through the entrance, the two sisters chatting with the gardener.The elder sister was surnamed Liu, named Qin. The younger sister was likewise surnamed Liu, named Caiyun. Liu Qin and Liu Caiyun\u2014those were their names.From his subordinates, Lu Sheng understood that a great tragedy had befallen their family. All their family members had perished, leaving them in destitution.They did not explain the specifics of what had happened, but Lu Sheng could sense that they were hiding a secret on them.As he passed by the greenhouse presently, Lu Sheng noticed an exposed stretch of bare skin on the elder sister Liu Qin\u2019s arm, which hung by her side.What was peculiar was that her skin on her arm was a swollen purple and was almost deformed. But Liu Qin seemed not to notice it at all.Lu Sheng smiled and nodded at the two of them. The two sisters nodded in response while the gardener bowed his head reverently. Only after Lu Sheng had walked on a distance did he leave in a hurry for his duties after some final instructions to the sisters.Only the two sisters were left at the greenhouse entrance now.\u201cBig Sis, can we stay here for a few more days?\u201d The younger sister Liu Caiyun asked in a whisper.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t. Otherwise, we\u2019ll implicate Young Master Lu,\u201d Liu Qin replied calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s now near the time when your arm acts up, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cMm,\u201d Liu Caiyun nodded.\u201cThose things will come again. If we stay here too long, this place will be destroyed too,\u201d a trace of pain flashed across Liu Qin\u2019s eyes.\u201cBut\u2026 I like it here. These flowers\u2026 they\u2019re so pretty\u2026\u201d Liu Caiyun mumbled softly.\u201cMe too\u2026\u201d Liu Qin spoke in a hushed voice as well. \u201cBut Young Master Lu is but a mortal. So is everyone else here.\u201dLiu Caiyun fell into silence.After a long while, she finally replied chokingly, \u201cI understand\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d Liu Qin embraced her younger sister gently. \u201cI can sense them. They\u2019re coming.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Liu Caiyun did not speak. She only rested her cheek against her elder sister\u2019s bosom, bursting a patch of blisters on her cheek. Yellow pus oozed our of them, wetting Liu Qin\u2019s robes.\u201cCreak~\u201dThe door opened and Lu Sheng strode into the room, closing the door behind him. He was about to rest on his bed when he suddenly froze abruptly and surveyed the entire bedroom.Several stools sat around the black dining table. Half-read books were spilled atop the square study table. The blanket on the bed was messy, just the way he had left them after waking up.What made Lu Sheng\u2019s face turn dark was that he saw a pale hand lightly gripping on to the edge of the curtain beside his bed.It was as if someone was sitting on his bed, holding up the curtain to prevent it from falling over the bed.But from Lu Sheng\u2019s angle, he could only see the hand.\u201cWho\u2019s that?!\u201d His eyes dangerous, Lu Sheng\u2019s right hands went slowly to the hilt of the saber behind his waist.There was no reply. Very slowly and gradually, the hand retracted back into the bed. It moved at a tortoise\u2019s pace, without a sound. But Lu Sheng was clear that there was only a wall in the direction of where the hand was retracting.He humphed coldly. Then, with great agility, he leapt over and ripped the curtains away with force.\u201cRIP!\u201dThe curtain was ripped away, revealing an empty bed. Nothing was on it.The bed was placed in the corner of two walls. On two of its sides were walls. The other two sides were empty and visible to plain sight. Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze swept across the entire room again.\u201cTrying to run!?\u201d He laughed coldly. Without warning, he struck the bed forcefully dead in its center with his palm.A scorching wave of heat radiated across the air, producing a ear-piercing sound of breaking wind.\u201cBOOM!!!\u201dThe entire bed collapsed. Broken wood creaked as thick splinters rubbed against each other. In the midst of the sound, a faint scream rang out.Suddenly, a black shadow pounced at Lu Sheng from under the bed.\u201cBlood web!\u201d Lu Sheng did not move, but inner Qi rolled around his body. Level Seven Ultimate Crimson Mantra activated and immediately, an invisible layer of blood web spread out over the area in front of him.\u201cBOOM! SZZZZZ!\u201dA blood-curdling scream rang out in the air.Soon, a gush of cold air rushed out of the room. The room returned to normal.After the wind had ceased, Lu Sheng carefully sensed his surroundings before finally putting down his guard.\u2018Some filthy thing entered my room? Is it because my Body of Half-Yin has become more powerful? Or is it because of the two little girls?\u2019 He narrowed his eyes as he examined his room. A series of slaps on his door rang out.\u201cExternal Head! Are you alright!?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m alright,\u201d Lu Sheng opened the door. \u201cCarry the bed out and bring in a new one.\u201dThe subordinates entered the room to see a collapsed bed. Instantly, they stared at each other dumbly in shock.\u201cYes, sir,\u201d although they did not know what had happened, none of them dared to ask Lu Sheng.While the subordinates changed his bed, Lu Sheng bent at his waist to pick up a small pink purse on the ground.The purse was decorated with an embroidery of mandarin ducks playing in the water. The embroidery was coarse rather than intricate, however. It looked like one of the cheap goods from a street hawker.But Lu Sheng felt that it was cold to the touch.\u2018To think that I even have Yin Qi being delivered up to my doorstep,\u2019 a grin cracked open on Lu Sheng\u2019s face. Since there wasn\u2019t much Yin Qi on it, Lu Sheng bit his finger and pressed it gently on the purse there and then.\u201cSzzz\u2026\u201d after a faint and indiscernible sizzle, a thin strand of Yin Qi flowed into Lu Sheng\u2019s chest through his arm, where it was absorbed.Very soon, the purse was no longer cold to the touch.\u201cWho\u2019s that!\u201d Suddenly, the voices of sect disciples standing sentry outside rang out. \u201cHow dare you attempt to barge into the External Head\u2019s resting room? Are you courting death?!\u201d\u201cThis Brother, Young Master Lu is in grave danger now! You must wake him up immediately!\u201d Liu Qin\u2019s voice rang out with a tone of unmistakable urgency.\u201cDanger?\u201d The men laughed. \u201cOnly our boss ever puts others in danger. Alright now, you two ugly hags, go back and sleep. Don\u2019t hang around here.\u201dLiu Qin and her sister?Lu Sheng overheard the exchange from inside his room. A trace of humor flashed across his eyes. He walked out of his room and immediately saw the two sisters still trying to get past the sect disciples.\u201cYou\u2019re here? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d He walked over and asked flippantly.\u201cYoung Master Lu\u2026 you\u2026 did you encounter any strange phenomena?\u201d Liu Qin instantly heaved a sigh of relief at the sight of Lu Sheng, as if a huge burden had been lifted off her.\u201cStrange phenomenon? There was a burglar in my room. I sent her flying god-knows-where with a palm strike, and she left behind a purse. To think it was a woman,\u201d Lu Sheng tossed the purse into the air with a chuckle.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026!?\u201d Seeing the purse, both Liu Qin and Liu Caiyun trembled in shock.\u201cYoung Master! It\u2019s our dereliction of duty!\u201d The sect disciples hurried to apologize, color drained from their faces.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I was bored anyway. I\u2019ve been training martial arts day in and day out\u2026 I was just hoping for some excitement,\u201d Lu Sheng grinned as he cast the sisters a meaningful look.\u201cYoung Master Lu\u2026\u201d Liu Qin hesitated, \u201cAren\u2019t\u2026 aren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d\u201cAfraid?\u201d Lu Sheng waved his hand, dismissing the guards. \u201cBoth of you follow me,\u201d he said to the pair of sisters.Leading the two of them behind him, he went straight to a corner of the backyard of the tower that had just been constructed. It was a deserted spot. Moreover, Lu Sheng had men standing guard outside, forbidding all entry.He sat on a stone stool without further ado.\u201cSpeak. Who on earth are the two of you. And how is it that you can attract ghosts?\u201dAt the sound of the word \u201cghosts\u201d, the pair of sisters stared at him blankly. Then, strangely, instead of looking surprised, fearful, or grim, their blank stares gradually turned into looks of liberation and exhilaration.They were the eyes of hope that could be found on a castaway who finally lay sight on an island after drifting on the sea for a long time. He waited a few seconds for both of them to regain their composure.\u201cYou\u2026 you know about ghosts too?\u201d The younger sister Liu Caiyun asked cautiously.\u201cOf course. We cross paths with the troublesome stuff very often. Otherwise, how do you think we could establish ourselves over such a large region?\u201d A frown appeared on Lu Sheng\u2019s forehead instantly as he saw the pair of sisters behaving differently from how he had expected them to.\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026 since Young Master Lu already knows about them, then we don\u2019t have to beat around the bush,\u201d Liu Qin said, a sense of relief and liberation in her tone.\u201cAll along, we\u2019ve assumed that only we could deal with ghosts and the supernatural. But now we\u2019ve finally met an expert like Young Master Lu!\u201dLu Sheng\u2019s mind was befuddled.\u201cStart right from the beginning. Why am I getting even more confused?\u201d\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll start right from the beginning for you,\u201d Liu Qin said earnestly.She began recalling how it all began. A hint of tenderness and pain emerged in her eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Both my sister and I were studying in a private academy. One day, a bunch of bad people came to our house,\u201d hatred swirled in Liu Qin\u2019s eyes.\u201cThose bad people were very, very powerful. They killed Old Master and our house protector. Even the reinforcements we got from outside could not escape the same fate. After slaughtering all members of the main family, they started killing the branch families.Only in retrospect did we realize that our family was merely collateral damage. Our Liu Family was also a branch family of a larger family. Those bad people were looking for an item. They slaughtered their way to our Liu Family, ruining and destroying us.\u201d\u201cIt was only under the help of a good Samaritan that we were able to escape under disguise as beggars. We begged our way to the Northern Lands after that,\u201d Liu Caiyun added.\u201cThen, as for why you would encounter attacks by ghosts\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng frowned.\u201cThat\u2019s a special ability that my sister and I were born with. We were innately gifted with a constitution that attracts ghosts and spirits, and which is able to sense and detect their presence and abilities,\u201d Liu Qin quickly replied.Beside her, Liu Caiyun quickly nodded too.Lu Sheng\u2019s face remained calm; the sisters could not tell if he believed them or not.\u201cI see\u2026 so, what plans do you have now?\u201dThe two sisters glanced at each other. Liu Qin spoke first, \u201cSince those things have come again, we better leave this place.\u201dHearing that, Lu Sheng\u2019s frown grew deeper.\u201cHow old are the two of you this year?\u201dLiu Qin and her sister were caught by surprise, perplexed by Lu Sheng\u2019s intention behind his question. Nonetheless, they replied honestly,\u201cI\u2019m eleven. My sister\u2019s ten.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so young. And both of you are sick. Is there any point in continuing to flee? Sooner or later, you\u2019d die of starvation or thirst. Or of illness. Or perhaps by ghosts,\u201d Lu Sheng said.He rose and sighed, a trace of compassion in his eyes. He closed his eyes and thought for a moment.\u201cFine,\u201d Lu Sheng said. \u201cI\u2019d ignore this if I hadn\u2019t seen this. But since it\u2019s happened right before my eyes, I can\u2019t just ignore it.Both of you girls can rest and recover under my care. I\u2019m still missing two assistants. How about both of you fill those vacancies?\u201d He said.\u201cThank you, Young Master Lu. But\u2026 assistant? What does that mean? What does the job entail?\u201d Liu Qin hesitated with caution.\u201cOh, basically to tidy up after me,\u201d Lu Sheng smiled.\u201cOh, like a maid? We can do that!\u201d Liu Caiyun blurted out without waiting for her sister to speak.Liu Qin was about to speak, but seeing as her sister had already agreed, she kept quiet.\u201cGo look for Jade Lotus. Tell him that this is my arrangement. Let the physician come and take a look at your condition and make a list of all the medicinal herbs needed,\u201d Lu Sheng instructed.\u201cIs that really ok?\u201d Liu Qin stared at Lu Sheng wide-eyed, finding it hard to believe that such grace would fall from the skies.\u201cOf course it is,\u201d Lu Sheng chuckled. \u201cI have high hopes for both of you. The ability to detect the presence of ghosts in this world is extremely rare. There\u2019s great potential for your future development; don\u2019t underestimate yourselves,\u201d he encouraged.\u201cReally\u2026?\u201d Liu Caiyun\u2019s voice trembled.\u201cOf course. As for your body constitution that attracts ghosts, don\u2019t worry. I was just looking for an opportunity to practice my saber strokes. Both of you will stay in the room above mine,\u201d Lu Sheng grinned, revealing a row of white, ghastly-looking teeth which gave him a look of savagery. Yet, his savagery at this moment was incredibly reassuring to the two sisters.\u201cThank you, Young Master Lu\u2026\u201d Liu Qin gritted her teeth and knelt before Lu Sheng suddenly, pulling her sister into kneeling position with her.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s nothing!\u201d Lu Sheng hurriedly pulled both of them up. \u201cYou\u2019ve encountered such great calamity at a young age, but have kept your heart from being distorted and preserved your integrity. It\u2019s deeply admirable. Since I\u2019m able to lend a helping hand, I most certainly won\u2019t shy away from it.\u201dThe Liu sisters burst out in gratitude and appreciation for him. After experiencing so many ups and downs, they deeply understood how precious a refuge where they could truly rest was.All along, they had been fleeing in all directions, not daring to stay in one place for more than a while. Both of them had awoken in fright innumerable times and fled in hurry. Often, they implicated the good Samaritans who had taken them in. They had cried too many times, their hopes shattered too often.But this time, things seemed different from previously. This Young Master Lu standing before them was muscular and bald. His glare was fierce and his aura extraordinary. Most importantly, he was completely undaunted by ghosts. The ghost which had just been attracted was dealt with by this Young Master Lu without so much as a blink of an eye. That went to show how strong he was.As Liu Qin left, a trace of hope was birthed in her heart once more. Perhaps this time, they could stay longer in this place.Both sisters left the yard and returned to their room, about to change their clothes and look for Jade Lotus to get their condition checked out.\u201cSis, do you think we can finally stop fleeing now?\u201d Liu Caiyun whispered.Liu Qin fell into silence.Liu Caiyun continued, \u201cSis, why didn\u2019t you tell Young Master Lu the truth? He\u2019s a good man.\u201d\u201cSo what if I did?\u201d Liu Qin retorted. \u201cOur trouble is too great. Even if I told him, we\u2019d at most be able to stay here for just a slight bit longer.\u201d\u201cEven just one day more would be nice\u2026\u201d Liu Caiyun mumbled.Liu Qin sighed.\u201cWe can\u2019t implicate Young Master Lu. He\u2019s already very kind to us.\u201d\u201cI know\u2026\u201d Liu Caiyun was crestfallen. \u201cAs long as a single day goes by in which Giant Spirit Blood remains unfound, they won\u2019t leave us alone\u2026\u201d\u201cShush!\u201d Liu Qin quickly pressed a finger to her lips.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be scared of? It\u2019s not like we\u2019ve got any idea where that thing is! We\u2019re just but a branch of the Liu Family. How\u2019s it fair that we\u2019ve got to pay the price for the main branch\u2019s woes!\u201d Liu Caiyun\u2019s eyes were filled with hate. \u201cDaddy\u2026 Mummy\u2026 what wrong did they do that they had to be skinned alive?! What wrong did we do!? This life is worse than death!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Caiyun!\u201d Liu Qin finally reached the end of her tolerance and shouted.Liu Caiyun fell silent. She bit her lip as tears welled up in her eyes.\u201cOne day, if I\u2019m powerful enough\u2026 I must make all those who\u2019ve harmed us, who\u2019ve gloated in our misfortune\u2026 I must make them all\u2026\u201d her eyes spit venom.\u201cCaiyun!!!\u201d Liu Qin hugged her. \u201cHave you forgotten what Dad and Mum taught us??!\u201d\u201cSis\u2026 whoever\u2019s kind to me, I\u2019ll be kind to him or her. Whoever\u2019s bad to me, I\u2019ll make them suffer a living death! Isn\u2019t that fair?\u201d Liu Caiyun replied, a tremor in her voice.Liu Qin did not know what to say.Outside the door, Lu Sheng stood still by the entrance, listening thoughtfully to the conversation inside.He was about to take the two of them to see the physician personally when he overheard their secret.It seemed like the pair of sisters did not have any body constitution that attracted ghosts. Rather, it seemed more like they were being hunted by a certain faction.\u2018Interesting,\u2019 Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes narrowed as he left swiftly.But if the ghost from earlier was a benchmark for their strength, then this faction was really but a small fry in his eyes.***\u201cBAM! BAM! BAM BAM BAM!!!\u201dThick cudgels smashed onto Lu Sheng\u2019s body. On his back, chest, and shoulders\u2014people continuously hit him heavily.Lu Sheng\u2019s top was bared. The muscles on his body were solid like chiseled metal, reflecting a layer of oily glint under the sun.All around him were cudgel-wielding muscular men from Crimson Whale Sect. Each one of them was exhausted, yet forced to continue hitting Lu Sheng with the iron cudgel.In the clearing in the greenhouse, Lu Sheng\u2019s body was expanding, thick bands of muscles intertwining with each other like steel bars. Fine veins emerged on the surface of his skin like chains.That was one of the signs of Initiation in Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Where\u2019s the medicinal tub?\u201d Lu Sheng opened his eyes and surveyed the men around him, who collapsed in exhaustion.\u201cIt\u2019s already prepared, Big Bro,\u201d Duan Meng\u2019an hurriedly said.Lu Sheng nodded. It has been tough on these subordinates. Apart from Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill, another reason why it was hard for him to attain Initiation in this hard body skill was the fact that he had already cultivated Bear Wrestling Arm.In order to practice a second hard body skill after already mastering one, the body needs to receive stimulation of an even greater intensity to train its toughness.This also resulted in a high level of difficulty for Lu Sheng to be initiated into Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill.\u2018But thankfully it\u2019s done,\u2019 Lu Sheng took his top from Duan Meng\u2019an, gulped down some water, wiped his sweat and strolled back into his room.In the middle of his room was a round wooden tub which was filled to the brim with a purplish black medicinal bath.\u2018Martial arts are for the rich indeed\u2026 just this tub of medicinal bath alone is worth at least ten taels of silver,\u2019 Lu Sheng shook his head.Without further ado, he rapidly stripped himself of his clothes and stepped into the tub.\u201cSzzz\u2026..\u201dA thick burning sensation spread all over his skin and swiftly permeated his five bowels and six viscera.Lu Sheng completely submerged himself up to his neck into the medicinal bath, leaving only his head outside.\u2018Let\u2019s begin,\u2019 he shut his eyes and leaned on the tub. \u2018Deep Blue.\u2019With a swish, the Modifier screen appeared before his eyes.He clicked the \u2018Begin Modification\u2019 button with great familiarity. Then his gaze fell on Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill.\u2018Upgrade Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill to Level One,\u2019 Lu Sheng declared in his mind.Instantly, the Modifier blurred and the status display of Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill jumped from \u201cInitiated\u201d to \u201cLevel One\u201d.\u201cSzzz\u2026.\u201dA faint sizzle entered Lu Sheng\u2019s ears. He looked down into the tub to see the purplish black medicinal liquid turn clear at visible speed.At the same time, a hot flush radiated out from inside Lu Sheng\u2019s body but was quickly suppressed. Lu Sheng endured it purely by his constitution without serious repercussions.\u2018Looks like I was right to prepare ten servings of the medicinal liquid,\u2019 Lu Sheng immediately understood. The medicinal solution, together with his own fundamental constitution, must have enabled him to pull through the upgrading of Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill to Level One.\u2018Typically, the upgrade of a hard body skill requires repeated external stimulation, day after day, year after year, in order to increase the density of the body. Naturally, its strength and toughness would also rise. Such a transformation is far more drastic to the body than upgrading an inner force skill. That\u2019s probably why a hard body skill like Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill consumes more or less as much as Ultimate Crimson Mantra.But with the aid of sufficient medicinal liquid, the consumption can be reduced to an extent that allows continuous upgrading.\u2019He carefully sensed the traces of numbness circulating across the surface of his skin and muscles. This was Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill\u2019s inner Qi. Instead of circulating via the internal viscera, it traveled on the surface of the skin and muscles, forming a network all over the body\u2019s surface like a web of steel chains. When struck by external impact, especially by blunt force, it provided very effective defense. Bear Wrestling Arm, on the other hand, provided good defense against sharp weapons. Both skills thus complemented each other felicitously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0KurisuLu Sheng soaked himself in the medicinal tub for a while more, until the medicinal solution had completely turned into clear, grayish water. Only then did he slowly get out of the tub.Standing up, he clearly felt that his body had become much lighter.He looked at the box on the Modifier screen. In the row with Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill, a special effect was displayed.\u2018Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill: Level One. Special Effect(s): Amplified Strength.\u2019The hard body skill was like a thick layer that adhered to the surface of his skin.But Lu Sheng was not expecting the skill to result in any radical transformation of his body at Level One. After wiping himself dry, he went out for a cold shower again.The next day, he arose and went to the Crimson Whale early in the morning. During the routine meeting, the overall report was presented. He realized that the battle outside the city had come to a head.Zhen Family\u2019s Zhen Xun had led his forces to assault no less than twenty bases which belonged to the Scarlet District. At the same time, they disposed of a few dozen members of another new emerging faction.Their methods were cold and brutal. Even the Crimson Whale Sect representatives who came to handle the aftermath could not help but puke in disgust when they saw the sights.On the other hand, Scarlet District was not to be outdone. They intercepted two members of the Zhen Family on the frozen plains and succeeded in killing them before Zhen Xun\u2019s reinforcements could get there.This enraged the Zhen Family, which dispatched more forces to reinforce Zhen Xun. Scarlet District also mobilized more of their forces. Both sides were in a state of frenzy.As a vassal of Zhen Family, Crimson Whale Sect was implicated as well. Sometimes, before they finished dealing with the aftermath of incidents, they were assaulted by Scarlet District\u2019s vassals. The resulting battles led to victories on both sides.Scarlet District\u2019s vassal was another covert faction in the Northern Lands, called Scarlet Tower. They were a notorious assassin group in the Northern Lands. The revelation that they were a vassal of Scarlet District shook everyone to the core.Even Crimson Whale Sect could not underestimate the Scarlet Tower\u2019s intelligence network.Moreover, once their assassins were given a mission, they would often execute it without fear of death, putting their lives on the line with mad devotion. This caused great trouble for Crimson Whale Sect.During this period of time, quite a few Internal Affairs Emissaries were injured. Three Elders died in combat.Under the pretext of nursing his wounds, Lu Sheng was exempted from service. Even then, however, he could sense the increasingly tense atmosphere in the sect. Many of the sect\u2019s upper echelons showed up at the routine meetings in bandages.After the meeting ended, Lu Sheng enquired about the whereabouts of the sect\u2019s weapons section, then made a beeline for it.Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s weapons section was not on the ship. Rather, it was in a canyon near the Crimson Whale.He had long since desired a better weapon, but had not come across an opportunity. Such weapons were also typically incredibly expensive and rare.In the Hundred Weapons Canyon.\u201cSuperior weapons require superior materials. If External Head is unable to find them, how about trying a heavy weapon?\u201d The person-in-charge of the weapons section, Elder Duan, suggested as he caressed his beard.\u201cHeavy weapon?\u201d Lu Sheng stared at the muscular blacksmith beside him, who was cooling down a red-hot blade with icy cold water from the canyon\u2019s spring. White steam billowed from the weapon.\u201cIndeed,\u201d Elder Duan smiled. \u201cThis old man can see that External Head Lu is well-built. You can use a heavy weapon that weighs several dozen catties, built thick. With it, you won\u2019t be at a disadvantage even against the finest weapons. Although it\u2019s not as sharp as them, it makes up for it with its sheer weight. That in itself is a form of power.\u201dLu Sheng nodded, seeing the sense in his suggestion.\u201cIn that case, what sort of heavy weapon does Elder Duan think is suitable for me? My inner force skill is inherited from Sect Master\u2019s Ultimate Crimson Mantra. Would a hammer amplify the might of my inner force?\u201d\u201cMay I know if you know any hammer techniques?\u201d Elder Duan countered.\u201cEr\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head. But he knew he could find someone to teach it to him. In just a short time, as long as he got initiated in it, he could master it in no time. That was how much of a cheat the Modifier was.\u201cThen which type of weapon did you achieve Intent Proficiency in?\u201d Elder Duan asked again. \u201cWhich intent did you focus on in Spirit Focus?\u201d\u201c\u2026it\u2019s the saber,\u201d realization dawned on Lu Sheng. \u201cLooks like I\u2019m stuck with using the saber.\u201d Intent was not something that could be mastered in a jiffy.\u201cIt not that you\u2019re stuck with the saber. It\u2019s that you\u2019re eminently suited to the saber,\u201d Elder Duan smiled. \u201cI do have a pair of great sabers here with me. If you want, you can give it a try. This pair of sabers was custom-made for a herculean External Affairs Emissary. It\u2019s a pity that before it was ready, he\u2026\u201d the elder sighed.\u201cA pair of twin sabers? Let me take a look,\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s interest was immediately piqued at the idea of the twin sabers.\u201cPlease come with me, External Head,\u201d Elder Duan nodded, leading Lu Sheng swiftly past many furnaces to a pitch-black armory, located at the innermost end of the weapons section.The armory was built like a hall with stone. A wide assortment of weapons rested on racks, row after row.Sabers, spears, staffs, cudgels, swords, daggers, and halberds. Lu Sheng felt like a boy in a candy shop, spoiled by the multitude of choices before him.\u201cThis way, External Head,\u201d Elder Duan led Lu Sheng past rows of weapons racks, quickly arriving at the heavy weapons section.In a corner of this section, Elder Duan pointed at a pair of giant sabers, presently being oiled by some helpers. He said to Lu Sheng, \u201cExternal Head, these are the sabers suitable for you which I told you about\u2014the twin sabers Lonely Crescent.\u201dLu Sheng walked closer for a better look.Two thick-backed giant sabers, each a meter long, rested firmly against the rack. The saber blades shone with a silver glint and were broad like signboards. Three metal hoops looped through the back of each saber.They were thick and steady indeed. The back of each saber was as thick as the width of one\u2019s palm. The broadness of the saber was comparable to the width of one\u2019s waist. But somehow, they looked awkward to Lu Sheng.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Elder Duan asked with undisguised pride. \u201cThis pair of twin sabers\u2014Lonely Crescent\u2014was forged personally by this old man a few years ago. They were forged over thirty-six back-breaking days, with fourteen different techniques used repeatedly. The materials chosen were all of the finest caliber. They\u2019re absolutely far sharper and tougher than the average great saber.\u201dLu Sheng stared wordlessly at the twin sabers Lonely Crescent with a frown.\u201cElder Duan\u2026 aren\u2019t these clearly a pair of butcher\u2019s knives? What Lonely Crescent? Even such a nice-sounding name cannot hide the fact that they\u2019re basically, at the end of the day, butcher knives.\u201dElder Duan shook his head as he chuckled.\u201cButcher knives? No, of course not. Though each of these twin sabers may weigh as much as seventy-six catties, you\u2019ll know what\u2019s so exceptional about them when you actually wield them.As for its form\u2026 as long as they\u2019re useful, so what if they look like butcher knives?\u201dHe made sense. Although Elder Duan conceded in his last sentence, Lu Sheng was a pragmatist as well who did not have too high a requirement for appearances.\u201cCan I try holding them?\u201d\u201cNaturally,\u201d Elder Duan waved, gesturing for him to do as he pleased.Lu Sheng nodded. Flexing his shoulders and arms, he slowly stepped up to the rack and gripped the hilt of one of the Lonely Crescent sabers.\u201cUp!\u201d Mustering his strength, he lifted the entire butcher knife up in the air.Outer force emphasized physical strength extensively. Lu Sheng first began by practicing Black Tiger Saber Technique, then Pursuing the Wind Blade and Double-Horned Blade afterwards. All these were outer force saber techniques.And now, he had mastered two hard body skills which further amplified physical strength. His Bear Wrestling Arm comprised of only one level and so he had achieved full mastery over it. Additionally, he also possessed Level One of Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill.Added together, these miscellaneous outer force skills had transformed him from a frail, refined scholar into today\u2019s hulking Hercules, who boasted freak-like physical strength.Veins and arteries popped up on Lu Sheng\u2019s arms as he employed that strength. Instantly, his physical stature expanded.Originally, he was already twice as broad as Elder Duan and a head taller than the average man. Now, his body inflated further, like a balloon. His muscles bulged and turned even firmer.\u201cUp!\u201d Lu Sheng lifted the second Lonely Crescent saber in his other hand, holding both sabers up in the air with both arms.\u201cClang!\u201dHe crossed both sabers before him. The saber blade reflected his face as clearly as a mirror.\u201cVery fitting! Unexpectedly so,\u201d Lu Sheng remarked in surprise.\u201cSeems like External Head Lu is truly destined to meet this Lonely Crescent. In that case, I\u2019ll give you a fifty percent discount. Just a hundred taels of silver would be enough!\u201d\u2018A hundred taels\u2026\u2019 Lu Sheng was speechless. This old man really dared to ask. Apart from its unique design, this pair of sabers was basically forged from ordinary steel. Their might lay only in their weight. How dared he ask for a hundred taels!\u201cTwenty taels.\u201d\u201cTwenty taels!? Why don\u2019t you go rob a bank! This old man spent all of his life\u2019s energy to forge these two superior-\u201d\u201cButcher knives.\u201dLu Sheng finished his sentence for him, choking Elder Duan in the middle of his sentence.Although these two sabers were indeed modeled after butcher knives and were, in fact, forged from a large amount of scrap metal, most people would at least keep up the appearances instead of exposing that bluntly.\u201cTwenty taels are way too little. Not even enough to cover my costs!\u201d Elder Duan waved his hands.\u201cTen taels then,\u201d Lu Sheng swung the twin sabers. Although the choice of materials was inferior, it was indeed forged well. The proportion and size were satisfactory, too. If he encountered speed-type opponents again, a simple turn of the saber would cover most of his vital body parts.\u201cTen taels!?\u201d Elder Duan\u2019s face was distorted with anger. \u201cFine, fine, fine. Twenty taels then. You\u2019re really one of a kind! Let me tell you this\u2014if these twin sabers Lonely Crescent were on sale elsewhere, forget about getting it without at least two hundred taels.\u201d\u201cWell, there first needs to be a buyer for it. At such weight, do you imagine that many fighting over them?\u201d Lu Sheng swung the sabers casually. Instantly, the sabers whipped up a mini typhoon, blowing Elder Duan\u2019s beard all over his face.\u201cYou\u2019re really repaying my kindness with meanness! External Head, you\u2026\u201d Elder Duan was at a loss of terms to describe Lu Sheng.\u201cIs there somewhere I can test out their power?\u201d Swinging the sabers, Lu Sheng felt increasingly satisfied with them.\u201cFollow me,\u201d Elder Duan humphed coldly, greatly upset.\u201cAnd also, \u2018Lonely Crescent\u2019 doesn\u2019t fit as a name for these twin sabers,\u201d Lu Sheng took two saber sheaths along with him. They were made of pig hide, with hemp ropes tied all over it, indicating a cheap and hardy style. How could such a style be sold for two hundred taels? Unless Elder Duan was dreaming\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s crap! That\u2019s the name this old man picked personally. They\u2019re shaped like the crescent and sickle. I initially wanted to name them \u2018Lonely Sickle\u2019, but it didn\u2019t sound nice. That\u2019s why I changed it to \u2018Crescent\u2019. Why? You\u2019ve got a bone to pick with me with that?\u201d Unable to make much money out of the deal, Elder Duan\u2019s tone turned impolite as he retorted.\u201cSince I\u2019m the one using it, it will certainly be named whatever I choose to name it,\u201d Lu Sheng cared not in the slightest for the maker\u2019s naming rights.\u201cLet\u2019s call it the Ghost Head Saber.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of name is that?\u201d Elder Duan was speechless.Lu Sheng smiled without replying. Both of them walked out of the armory and into a big room in the side of the wall.The room was enclosed with stone walls on all four sides. A sturdy wooden puppet with some hay wrapped around it was placed in its middle.\u201cThis is hardwood. High hardness. Very tough. You try,\u201d Elder Duan said as he pointed at the wooden puppet. \u201cIf you can hack through it, I\u2019LL pay YOU twenty taels!\u201dLu Sheng lifted the two butcher knives and walked to the front of the puppet, the corners of his mouth curving upwards into a savage grin.\u201cFor real?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instantly, the air howled with the sound of friction.Since Elder Duan dared to make such a wager even after knowing that he had mastered the Ultimate Crimson Mantra, Elder Duan clearly had done some mental estimation of Lu Sheng\u2019s might.After some calculation, Lu Sheng decided that he might as well use go ahead to use Level Five of Ultimate Crimson Mantra. Such a level of power was not out of character for him based on his known strength.\u201cHOWL!\u201dBoth great sabers slashed towards the wooden puppet continuously.\u201cBAM!!!\u201dAs if striking the surface of extremely elastic rubber, Lu Sheng instantly felt a powerful force bouncing back against him in the saber hilts in his hands. In the blink of an eye, both sabers in his hands were bounced back towards him.\u201cAgain!!!\u201d Before Elder Duan could mock him, veins bulged on Lu Sheng\u2019s face as the twin sabers hacked at the wooden puppet once more. Looking like two signboards, the twin sabers howled as they cut through the air.\u201cBAM!!!\u201dAgain, the twin sabers rebounded back at him.\u201cOne more time!\u201d Lu Sheng was getting mad. The two sabers hacked at the wooden puppet for the third time.\u201cHOO HOO HOO HOO\u2026\u201dThe twin sabers whipped up a whirlwind, blasting at Elder Duan\u2019s beard and robes.He opened his mouth as if he was trying to say something, only to see Qi gushing all over Lu Sheng as the twin sabers slashed continuously at the wooden puppet violently. Herculean strength slammed onto the wooden puppet again and again, causing the entire testing room to tremble. Beneath his feet, the stone floor vibrated, numbing his legs.\u201cBAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!!!\u201dDeep and dull hacking sounds reverberated without end. Lu Sheng seemed to take great pleasure in the powerful rebounds, the corner of his mouth curving up into an eccentric smirk. Without a word, he continued slashing at the puppet\u2019s neck.The saber blades slashed and cut across the puppet\u2019s surface intensely, carving out streaks of wounds into it like a saw. Most of them were concentrated around its neck, and were growing deeper and wider by the second.\u201cBAM!!!\u201dAnother slash hacked on the wooden puppet\u2019s neck with earth-splitting force. The entire room trembled violently.Elder Duan\u2019s eyelids twitched in a frenzy as he watched Lu Sheng pull his blade out from the puppet. The sharp blade had left a deep cut into the poor puppet\u2019s neck.\u201cNot bad\u2026 it really can\u2019t be hacked through\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng turned to look at him, his mouth cracking open into a grin.Elder Duan looked at the wooden puppet. That poor thing\u2019s head was barely left hanging on its neck by a thin margin. The rest of it, its limbs and torso, was covered in scars of various shapes, some horizontal and some vertical. It was too painful a sight.This newly bought wooden puppet had been in use for no more than a few days. And now, it turned into a state no different from the its predecessor which had just been decommissioned after several decades of use.He felt like crying. This hardwood puppet was extremely expensive and boasted a rare hardness and toughness. Each one could last many years after purchase. But just one visit by Lu Sheng had turned it into a piece of scrap wood. It\u2019s true that it wasn\u2019t hacked through thoroughly yet, but what was left was no longer fit for use anymore\u2026\u201cForget it, forget it. Consider me unlucky. External Head Lu, you better leave now. Hand the money over to the accounts room outside. This old man won\u2019t see you to the door,\u201d Elder Duan clasped his hands together, averting his eyes from Lu Sheng to stop the bleeding in his heart.Lu Sheng was not bothered. The whole thing had been on purpose to begin with. Taking his leave from Elder Duan, he left the weapons section and rode back to his quarters.Now, he possessed his own fine weapon. This pair of twin sabers should be good for some time. Next, he had to concentrate and focus on upgrading his inner skill.However, he was already at Level Seven of Ultimate Crimson Mantra\u2014the highest level of the skill. Any higher and he would have to extrapolate it with Yin Qi. As for Nine Lakes Steel Chain Skill, it was merely a Strength Proficiency skill that raised his defense rather than one of his core skills. So, Ultimate Crimson Mantra was his priority.***Five days later, Ash Smoke Town.Dark, ominous clouds covered the sky. Fine rain fell unrelentingly like silk threads.The town was a scene of desolation. Occasionally, some passers-by would run across, seeking shelter and quickly vanishing from the streets and alleys.Under the roof of Hu Manor, a young master holding a black paper umbrella was gazing at the sky, his head lifted up towards it.Peering at the sky through the protruding roof carvings, a patch of dark gloom filled his vision. The fine rain showed no signs of abating, as if it would go on forever without end.The young master was standing outside the entrance of Hu Manor, on the left of the stone lion guardian, borrowing shelter from the extended roof.He glanced at the empty streets. Dark shadows loomed under the roofs of the houses that lined the street. Not a living soul could be seen, casting the entire street in a deathly silence.Only dark gloominess filled the wide street. Not a single light could be seen through the windows of the houses lining both sides of the street, as if the entire street was uninhabited. The whole place was dark and depressing.Light was dimming.The young master frowned. He looked down at the black robes on him. Near his feet, his robes had been soaked wet by the rain. Water dripped from them onto his red embroidered shoes.\u201cI hate rain,\u201d he sighed.His voice was not loud; yet on this deserted rainy street, it seemed uncannily abrupt.Because no one else could be seen on the entire street apart from him.\u201cEach time it rains, my mood sours,\u201d the young master continued.There was no reply.The rain landed on the roof like needles, dripping down along its edge to land beside the Young Master\u2019s feet, splashing onto the robes near his feet.\u201cThis place\u2019s quite a distance from Donglin Manor. I didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d be able to catch up with me,\u201d the young master said to seemingly no one in particular, as if somebody was really listening nearby.\u201cCreak\u2026\u201dHu Manor\u2019s main door suddenly opened gradually, revealing an empty interior. Wild grass grew unfettered within. Nobody visible had opened the door; it seemed to have opened by its own.Then, a lady in a scarlet dress, holding a scarlet paper umbrella, strolled out.The paper umbrella covered her facial features, but could not cover her svelte figure.\u201cZhen Yi\u2026 if I were to kill you\u2026 even Zhen Xun\u2026 would be sad\u2026\u201d the lady\u2019s voice started and stopped, as if she was trying to speak and hold her breath at the same time. It was both shrill and eccentric.The young master\u2019s face remained impassive as he placed his umbrella leaning against the wall casually and looked at the lady at the entrance of Hu Manor.\u201cTo think that even you came in person. Looks like the Scarlet District isn\u2019t worried that its old nest would be invaded.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no use\u2026 in that\u2026 Big Sis is there\u2026 even if Zhen Xun were to go\u2026 it\u2019d be pointless, heheh,\u201d the lady treaded slowly towards Zhen Yi, a weird giggle escaping her lips.Zhen Yi sighed. Their war with Scarlet District had finally escalated to its most intense stage. Today, whether it was him or the umbrella lady who would die here, the resulting developments would be nothing short of catastrophic.He was perplexed, however, at why Scarlet District would put all its eggs into one basket by dispatching such a key figure like the umbrella lady in person.Yet, since the situation has already developed this far, there was no turning back.Staring at the umbrella lady in the scarlet dress walking towards him, Zhen Yi sighed again. Silently and stealthily, a silver-white dagger slid out from his sleeve. He walked towards her.***The fine rain continued to fall. Lu Sheng sat on his seat, munching on a sweet melon. The melon had yellow flesh and tasted like watermelon in texture. It was just the thing to hydrate himself after training in such weather.Currently, the greenhouse had been thoroughly transformed into a training ground that belonged exclusively to his men. Apart from Lu Sheng himself, many of his subordinates would come early every morning to train and temper their bodies.After gulping down a few slices of melon, Lu Sheng caressed his head. His mood was a little depressed for his hair had not yet grown out. Ever since it was burnt in the fire, the hair on his body showed no signs of growth, consigning him to an extremely peculiar outward appearance.\u2018Originally, while I wasn\u2019t very handsome, at least I looked better than this. Sigh\u2026\u2019 he sighed as his gaze swept across the grounds around him. Many of his subordinates were training skills. They were merely practicing strokes or their lower body foundations, and thus were unafraid that their mantras would be stolen by others.\u2018Eh?\u2019 His line of sight was suddenly attracted to two petite figures in the corner. He was caught by surprise to see the Liu Qin sisters training as well. They hid in the corner, practicing a series of forward dashing and pouncing movements repeatedly.\u2018Seems like a dagger assassination technique. Not bad,\u2019 Lu Sheng had recently been exposed to many martial arts after a few trips to the Martial Proclamation Library in which he perused countless foundational martial arts for free. One look at their movements and posture told him what weapon they were training in.His eyes narrowed to a slit. He had decided to take in the two sisters on the spur of the moment because he\u2019d sensed Yin Qi on them. As for his subsequent talks about compassion\u2026 etc., they were merely a front. Although he wasn\u2019t an evil man, neither was he a philanthropist. Why would he shower kindness and help on others for no reason?He was merely using the two sisters as a magnet for ghosts. Little did he expect to overhear their secret.Now, he was still deliberating over whether to continue keeping them or send them away.After all, he had no idea how powerful the faction which hunted them was, or how important they viewed the sisters. At the thought, Lu Sheng rose and strolled towards the sisters.\u201cChi!\u201dLiu Caiyun missed a step, losing her balance and almost tripped.\u201cIt\u2019s not straight,\u201d her sister\u2019s, Liu Qin\u2019s voice rang out. \u201cCaiyun, I think that when we step forward, we should land on the sole of our feet, not the heel. And when we twist our bodies, it\u2019s best not to lean to one side.\u201d\u201cBut when I spin around, my feet hurts. And how do I see what\u2019s behind me if I don\u2019t lean to a side?\u201d Liu Caiyun was baffled.\u201cMust you see? Can\u2019t you just imagine?\u201d Liu Qin asked.\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201d Liu Caiyun shook her head.Just as the two of them were arguing, Lu Sheng walked up to them.Seeing their crude and rudimentary combat skills, doubts arose in Lu Sheng\u2019s heart. If the two of them were truly related to the Noble Families and were, perhaps, a branch family of one of those Noble Families which could fight ghosts, then how could they not know even such basic techniques? Their movements were clearly amateurish imitations by ordinary people.\u201cAre you practicing dagger assignation strokes?\u201d Lu Sheng asked.\u201cYoung Master Lu,\u201d Liu Qin curtsied at him with the standard curtsey of Young Ladies in wealthy families, which included a slight bend of the knee and a bow of the head.\u201cWe\u2019ve never learnt the dagger. We\u2019re just copying some movements that we saw others practicing\u2026\u201d she replied helplessly.\u201cThe stroke you\u2019re practicing isn\u2019t too shabby. But this stroke should be just one movement out of a series of consecutive movements. You must understand that each stroke contains many transformations to deal with many different situations. What you\u2019ve copied is merely one such transformation, suitable only for certain particular situations,\u201d Lu Sheng smiled as he explained.\u201cOh I see\u2026.\u201d realization dawned on the sisters. All along, they felt that there was something wrong with the stroke they were practicing, but could not put a finger to it. Now, hearing Lu Sheng\u2019s explanation, they immediately realized where the problem lay.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0KurisuLu Sheng smiled at the two of them. From his observation of them during this period, the sisters\u2019 disease seemed to show signs of alleviating after some treatment. It was merely malignant skin diseases. Furthermore, they performed their duties as his personal assistants competently. Lu Sheng gave them many menial tasks to handle after his training sessions, like washing his robes, tidying the place, fetching water\u2026etc. They were fulfilling Qiao\u2019er\u2019s function well, and in fact, better than she could.Seeing the looks of realization and joy on their faces, an idea came to Lu Sheng\u2019s mind, \u2018These two girls have a mysterious background and possess a special ability. Why not lend them a helping hand when they\u2019re down in the gutters to sow a favor?\u2019After some thought, he suggested, \u201cIf you two would like to learn, I can impart you some basic saber techniques, actually. I can tell that you have never learnt any combat skills.\u201dJoy burst out on their faces.\u201cYoung Master\u2026 is that really possible?!\u201d Liu Qin was overwhelmed with excitement.\u201cOf course. Just some basic techniques,\u201d Lu Sheng nodded. On the spot, he demonstrated a forward stab stroke in the basic Crimson Whale Saber Technique.Unbeknownst to him, some sect disciples slowly gathered around him. After all, it was an incredibly rare opportunity to receive direct instruction from a top-notch expert like Lu Sheng.After Lu Sheng\u2019s detailed demonstration, he let the two girls practice on each other and adjust each other\u2019s positions. At the same time, he explained his personal understanding of Crimson Whale Saber Technique to his subordinates.The morning passed by speedily. Everyone was deeply impressed with Lu Sheng. They no longer felt as much fear towards the fierce and savage-looking External Head Lu Sheng as before. Rather, they now felt a certain familiarity with him.Similarly, the Liu Qin and Liu Caiyun sisters grew in respect for Lu Sheng. Whether it was his act of taking them in despite knowing the dangers involved, or his imparting of martial arts skills to them in person, this newly acquainted Young Master Lu had offered them assistance that far surpassed anything they had received from others.For several days after that, Lu Sheng continued to teach them some basic strokes each time he saw them and made them practice the saber technique repeatedly. The sisters also felt that their prowess had drastically increased compared to when they were groping in the dark on their own. When they sparred against each other now, they could grasp a certain rhythm of advancing and retreating.All along, they had no way to fight ghosts apart from using their trump card, which would be effective only with close physical contact. Moreover, because they did not know any combat skills, they had to put their lives on the line to barely put up a fight.Now, however, with Lu Sheng\u2019s instruction, both of them finally had the opportunity to turn from ordinary ignorant people to rookies who possessed some basic combat skills.Gradually, the two sisters regarded Lu Sheng as their Master and saw themselves increasingly as his disciples.Lu Sheng didn\u2019t mind that either. What he taught them was some of the most basic, foundational stuff that any sect disciple who mastered the Crimson Whale Saber Technique would know.But this basic stuff was what the sisters presently needed the most.At the same time as he taught them, he also soaked himself in a tub of medicinal bath once every few days to upgrade Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill.After two such baths, which involved exhausting his Yin-Yang Jade Crane inner force and pushing his body to its limits, he quickly upgraded this hard body skill to its highest level, Level Three.Once he activated the hard body skill, black veins would emerge all over his skin like a network of chains. He also reached new heights with the toughness of his body. Average Strength Proficiency experts would not be capable of scratching him as long as they did not use extremely sharp weapons.But what Lu Sheng mainly desired to upgrade was still Ultimate Crimson Mantra. Lu Sheng had already cultivated this inner force skill to its pinnacle. To upgrade it any higher, he would need to perform extrapolation with Yin Qi.But the Yin Qi absorbed from the purse of the ghost killed previously was too little; it was insufficient for extrapolating Level Seven of Ultimate Crimson Mantra. [1]He needed to find some other source of Yin Qi.In the blink of an eye, half a month passed.Lu Sheng went back and forth between his apartment and the Martial Proclamation Library while waiting for news from Fine Treasures Hall. At the same time, he tried to reach out to Elder Zhang Baiyu from the sect, who readily agreed to let him browse his beloved collection of antiques. To his disappointment, however, Lu Sheng found not even a single drop of Yin Qi among them.Lu Sheng then turned his thoughts to Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s warehouse. A wide assortment of miscellaneous objects was stored in it. Apart from various trophies and trading goods, there was also some intricate jewelry among them. But because most of these items were relatively new, there was no Yin Qi to be found among them.Lu Sheng ended up returning empty-handed again.News from old Sect Master also grew in urgency and gravity. Zhen Family\u2019s Zhen Yi, who was also the Young Master that he had seen previously, was unexpectedly assaulted at Ash Smoke Town, near Donglin Manor. Gravely injured, he was sent back to Zhen Family.Lu Sheng was finally assigned a mission to clean up the aftermath of a battle at Song Manor. A large battle had only just broken out there, in which the Scarlet District lost more than a few ghosts.To have necessitated the participation of Lu Sheng, the sect\u2019s Number Three expert, the danger and risk this mission entailed were self-evident. It was natural to expect an assault from Scarlet Tower. Moreover, there seemed to be an object that needed to be recovered from within Song Manor.After receiving the mission, Lu Sheng took the new pair of sabers, mustered his men, and headed straight for Song Manor without further ado. He had just attended Lu Chenxin\u2019s funeral at home and had a fresh sense that the situation was taking a very dire turn. Additionally, he was thirsting for Yin Qi and hence was hungry for more encounter with ghosts.***Song Manor.Lu Sheng stood outside the entrance, peering through it into the dilapidated courtyard within. Apart from signs of a fire, more than half of the entire Song Manor\u2019s perimeter wall had collapsed. The houses and buildings in it were riddled with gaping holes, making it look like a long-deserted, run-down temple.According to Zhen Family\u2019s representative who had been dispatched to Song Manor, the Anomaly in it had been completely wiped out. But many bodily remains were left behind which could easily evolve into new threats if left unhandled. Therefore, Crimson Whale Sect was tasked with clearing up the remains.Before Lu Sheng arrived, Song Manor was already surrounded by several dozen sect disciples. An Internal Affairs Emissary surnamed Wang had been in charge of guarding the place.At the sight of Lu Sheng, Internal Head Wang heaved a big sigh of relief. Within seven or eight days of guarding Song Manor, this man, originally weighing 180 catties, had lost a whopping thirty catties.After handing over a series of responsibilities to Lu Sheng, Internal Head Wang hurried back to rest. He had been taxed to his limits. Gazing at the scene within Song Manor now, Lu Sheng lifted his head and looked at the skies.The searing noon sun hung high up in the air. It was the hottest time of the day.Then, he looked at Ning San and Duan Meng\u2019an beside him. Behind them were five Strength Proficiency experts from Soaring Eagle Squad.\u201cStand guard outside here and forbid any entry or exit from this place. I\u2019ll go in for a look,\u201d he ordered.\u201cYes, sir!\u201d Everybody quickly acknowledged.The strongest among the experts from Soaring Eagle Squad was a tanned swordsman named Xu Chui. He was a middle-aged man whose skill and speed with the sword raised even Lu Sheng\u2019s eyebrows. His sword was more than a cut above Lu Sheng\u2019s Pursuing the Wind Blade in speed.This man had once performed his trademark skill, slicing an entire table into six neat squares in the blink of an eye. Out of the entire Soaring Eagle Squad, he was the one on whom Lu Sheng pinned the highest hopes of breaking through to Intent Proficiency.\u201cExternal Head, do you need me to accompany you?\u201d Xu Chui suggested after some hesitation. He had always kept a low-profile while in Soaring Eagle Squad and was of a down-to-earth personality. After Lu Sheng took them under his command, he did not take away their original benefits. Instead, he had even given him some instruction in martial arts on a number of occasions. Hence, he was now beginning to feel a degree of loyalty towards Lu Sheng.\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d Lu Sheng glanced at him with a turn of his head.\u201cHaven\u2019t we been practicing martial arts precisely for such a time?\u201d Xu Chui smiled without a worry.Lu Sheng considered and asked, \u201cDo you have a family?\u201dXu Chui nodded, \u201cI\u2019ve got a son. And a wife, and a concubine.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go then,\u201d Lu Sheng nodded, allowing him to follow. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t had a family, I wouldn\u2019t want your Xu Family to be cut off of posterity.\u201dXu Chui laughed, \u201cI trust External Head Lu. As long as we don\u2019t run into ghosts, those brats from Scarlet Tower are nothing before External Head.\u201d\u201cScarlet Tower has four Tower Lords. As long as it\u2019s one of them, I can guarantee your safety,\u201d Lu Sheng laughed. In public, his presently revealed strength was somewhere between Level Four and Five of Ultimate Crimson Mantra. Level Seven Ultimate Crimson Mantra and Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill were his hidden trump cards.In other words, he remained an inner and outer force double cultivator of the Spirit Focus level on the surface. Given his actual cultivation base, however, even a Divine Prime expert would probably find him a hard match if he went all out.But in order to prevent others from discovering Deep Blue, he had no choice but to hide the true extent of his powers.According to Deputy Sect Master Chen Ying who had once crossed paths with a Tower Lord from Scarlet Tower, the Tower Lords were at the peak of Spirit Focus. If they really did come, the only fate that awaited them was a gruesome death under Lu Sheng\u2019s saber.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d leading Xu Chui, Lu Sheng slowly strode towards Song Manor\u2019s door. This was the first time he was cleaning up for Zhen Family.He stepped over the threshold.The moment Lu Sheng entered the Manor, the first sight that welcomed him was a ghastly white female corpse hanging by the neck from a withered tree on a long rope, swaying in the wind. It was a corpse dressed in a grayish white skirt and a pale-yellow top.He paused in his steps and gazed at the corpse.The eyes of the woman had been gouged out and the nose sliced off. The entire corpse was like a deflated balloon, dried and distorted, hanging limply off the tree.\u201cThat\u2019s a Scarlet District ghost?\u201d Lu Sheng asked in a whisper.Xu Chui shook his head faintly, perplexed as well.\u201cDo all ghosts have a material body?\u201dLu Sheng attempted to recall. It seemed like all low-level ghosts lacked a material body. Those that he had killed left behind only some powder or small item. Only stronger ones like Souls of the Dead had fleshly bodies.Having gazed at the female corpse from a distance, Lu Sheng approached and walked to the feet of the female corpse. He unsheathed his saber and used its tip to flip the corpse, spinning it around.\u201cThis is a human corpse, not a ghost. Either a passer-by or someone from Scarlet Tower,\u201d Lu Sheng frowned.There was no Yin Qi on the corpse. But Lu Sheng was not bothered. Lowering his saber, he walked towards the central bedroom.When he had been here previously, the little girl\u2014the Anomaly\u2014had lived in this central bedroom. The manor had also kept Souls of the Dead and a whole gang of ghosts.Now that it was swept by Zhen Family, perhaps he could find some item or object with Yin Qi that hadn\u2019t dispersed yet.With a bam, he kicked open the wooden door of the central bedroom. Lu Sheng covered his nose with a palm to avoid the dust as he slowly entered the bedroom.Lots of disembodied robes lay sprawled across the floor in all directions. Grayish white powder like ashes was spilled all over them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0KurisuFrowning, Lu Sheng treaded among the white ashes gingerly. Upon entering the room, the cauldron which had previously been placed in the bedroom entered his view.Only half of the cauldron remained. The other half seemed to have been somehow melted; black liquid metal spilled from it onto the floor, then condensed into solid form.He walked to the cauldron and lightly caressed the surface of the metal. It was hard, cold, and rough.\u201cThis is a pill cauldron forged with intense heat. Ordinary fire certainly can\u2019t possibly melt it down like this,\u201d Xu Chui whispered as he neared.\u201cIt was not fire,\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head.Walking away from the cauldron, he began to examine the scene in the room. The articles of clothing sprawled across the floor had to be the remains of the ghosts. What puzzled him was that not a single trace of Yin Qi remained on them.After examining the clothes, Lu Sheng\u2019s gaze fell on the bed in the room. A charred corpse, black as ink, lay shriveled on the bed silently. Strangely, however, the bed on which it lay bore no marks of having been burnt before.Lu Sheng stood in front of the corpse, focusing his attention on it for a while. Then he quickly extended his hand towards the corpse\u2019s shut mouth, intending to pry it open. Something seemed to be in the corpse\u2019s mouth.\u201cIf I were you, I wouldn\u2019t touch the corpse\u2019s mouth,\u201d without warning, a flat female voice rang out from inside the room.\u201cWho\u2019s that!\u201d Xu Chui pulled out his sword instantly, looking in the direction of the voice.Lu Sheng turned around too and his eyes narrowed as he saw a middle-aged woman in a sapphire blue athletic outfit stroll in through the bedroom door.The woman\u2019s face looked normal; it was neither pretty nor ugly. Wrinkle lines could be seen at the corners of her eyes, as if she was nothing more than an ordinary woman.But what put Lu Sheng on his guard was one of the short swords in her hands.The short sword was razor-sharp and its blade was like a piece of silver silk. Just pinching it on its blade with one\u2019s bare hands would send shudders down the spine and give goose bumps.\u201cWho\u2019re you?\u201d Lu Sheng did not lay blame on the sect disciples on sentry outside. Since she had entered the room, he guessed that either they were dead or her hiding skills were too strong. Be it the former or the latter, neither of them was good news.Moreover, he detected a faint, almost imperceptible scent on her.The middle-aged woman sized Lu Sheng up.\u201cI\u2019m Zhuo Wenyu. If I\u2019m not wrong, you must be the third-in-command in Crimson Whale Sect\u2014External Head, Lu Sheng?\u201d\u201cYou know me?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s brows arched.\u201cCrimson Whale Sect has slaughtered so many of our people. If we don\u2019t investigate clearly, wouldn\u2019t it be foolish of us, Scarlet Tower?\u201d The woman chuckled, her voice sinister.\u2018It\u2019s someone from Scarlet Tower indeed,\u2019 Lu Sheng realized. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve met, shouldn\u2019t we be fighting with our lives now? How is it that you\u2019re in the mood to chit-chat with me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m different from the rest,\u201d Zhuo Wenyu replied casually. \u201cThe moment I heard that havoc broke out here, I rushed here as soon as I could. A pity I was still a little too late. But now it seems I\u2019m not that late after all. Any later and I would have missed even Brother Lu.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Lu Sheng stared at her carefully. It was his first encounter with someone from Scarlet Tower. She seemed no different from ordinary people, unlike how those around him had described them to be crazed fanatics.\u201cThere\u2019s no real need for the two of us to fight to the death. All I\u2019ve come for is this body. I want the object in its mouth,\u201d Zhuo Wenyu explained composedly. \u201cAs for Brother Lu, I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t wish to fight with me and lose many of your men either, do you? Not that you\u2019re afraid. But there\u2019s really no need.\u201dLu Sheng instantly got her drift.Both Crimson Whale Sect and Scarlet Tower were merely vassals working for the factions that backed them. Neither of them were putting their lives on the line for their own interests. Rather, all their efforts went to serving the powers behind them.In such a context, there was no real need for them to fight to the death. Zhuo Wenyu\u2019s meaning was clear as daylight, which was to be perfunctory and delay things as long as possible instead of really drawing blood. After all, regardless of which of them emerged the victor in the end, such a victory would be hollow. Only a victory achieved by the faction behind them would be genuine.Having thought it through, Lu Sheng did not wish to open fire and start a pointless battle either. His objective was merely to finish his mission of collection Yin Qi items. As long as the other party refrained from making a move, he would not.\u201cI want to check what it is you want first, and whether or not it\u2019s of use to me,\u201d he added after some thought.\u201cPlease,\u201d Zhuo Wenyu nodded, extending her hands in a gesture of \u2018go ahead\u2019.Lu Sheng pulled out his saber and gently pried open the corpse\u2019s mouth with its tip.\u201cSzz\u2026\u201dWith the sound of ripping cloth, an opening was slowly cut across the corpse\u2019s mouth. Black liquid gushed out from within, accompanied by a heavy, foul stench.Lu Sheng and Xu Chui quickly held their breath but were still forced backwards by the revolting smell.Soon, the black liquid was drained from the mouth, revealing an inky black disc-shaped metallic object.Lu Sheng turned to look at Zhuo Wenyu.\u201cThat\u2019s what you want?\u201d He asked.Zhuo Wenyu looked at Lu Sheng, \u201cThat\u2019s the one. Give it to me and we\u2019ll leave immediately.\u201d\u201cNo need. Take it yourselves. We\u2019ll go,\u201d Lu Sheng frowned. The stench was simply unbearable. Since he detected no presence of Yin Qi, he glanced at Xu Chui and quickly headed for the exit.Both of them passed by Zhuo Wenyu swiftly, yet neither of them made a move. Zhuo Wenyu remained where she was silently, turning around to watch Lu Sheng and Xu Chui leave.She stood still in the room, not bothered in the slightest by the stench of the black liquid. In fact, a look of enjoyment appeared on her face.Before long, she heard Lu Sheng\u2019s order for his men to retreat.But Zhuo Wenyu still did not budge. She continued staring at the courtyard outside the door.\u201cA mere brute. Why not kill him?\u201d Suddenly, a shrill female voice rang out beside her.She was clearly the only person in the room. Zhuo Wenyu\u2019s lips did not move an inch. Yet the voice rang out, audibly clear, carrying with it a sinister, demonic aura.\u201cIt\u2019s too obvious. It\u2019d be troublesome if we draw Zhen Family\u2019s attention.\u201d\u201cZhen Family has got no time for us now. The war between them and Scarlet District is getting more and more intense. Now\u2019s the time to profit from the panic,\u201d the voice whispered.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to kill an External Head, but hard to hide a corpse. I want him to send a signal for me.\u201d\u201cWhat signal?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the difference between you and me,\u201d Zhuo Wenyu started to smirk coldly. \u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cCreak\u2026\u201dSuddenly, another person entered the room.Zhuo Wenyu paused mid-sentence and lifted her head. Instantly, she was stunned.\u201cWhy have you come back\u2026?\u201d She stared at Lu Sheng, standing by the door.\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind,\u201d Lu Sheng grinned, pulling out the two gigantic butcher knives with backhand grips. \u201cThat thing. I want it now.Oh, and\u2026 hand over all the good stuff on you. Otherwise, don\u2019t blame me for not leaving you the chance to survive.\u201dHis mountainous stature, together with the two giant sabers, obstructed every square inch of the exit. An intense murderous intent immediately flooded all corners of the bedroom.Zhuo Wenyu\u2019s eyes narrowed, gazing intently at Lu Sheng. Suddenly, a bizarre grin flashed across her face.\u201cNever would I have thought that there\u2019d really be someone in this world who would court death intentionally for no reason\u2026\u201d\u201cBAM!!\u201dBefore she could finish her sentence, Zhuo Wenyu\u2019s pupils shrank as she saw an enormous blade, broad as a signboard, come slapping towards her on her left faster than she could react.With a loud smack, she was sent flying out and slammed violently on the stone wall on the side.\u201cBOOM!!\u201dLike a blooming flower, blood splattered all over the wall.Only now did Lu Sheng\u2019s figure appear at the side of the spot where Zhuo Wenyu previously stood. His speed was too fast. Or rather, his short-range explosive power was off the charts.Just Level Five of Ultimate Crimson Mantra coupled with Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill resulted in instantaneous explosive power. Add to that the toughness of his body due to his hard body skill, and these skills stacked together allowed him to dispense with all worries about the load of his moves within a several meters\u2019 radius on his body. At full strength, his explosive power was terrifying.\u201cOuch\u2026!\u201d Zhuo Wenyu stood up with great difficulty. Blood and wounds covered her broken body. Her elbow had been fractured and her leg twisted and twitched. She was also losing massive amounts of blood. Yet, astonishingly, none of these affected her mobility.Her eyes turned green as she stood up, a trifle unsteadily. She fixed her gaze on Lu Sheng.\u201cHow\u2019s it possible\u2026\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Lu Sheng looked at her curiously. \u201cYou\u2019re still not dead yet?\u201d\u201cYour strength\u2026 it\u2019s actually\u2026\u201d blood foamed at Zhuo Wenyu\u2019s mouth. She had been too careless. To the extent that she was hit at such close quarters and thus gravely wounded so early in the fight.Lu Sheng walked towards her slowly, reaching forward to grab at her.\u201cSWISH!\u201dSlippery like a snake, Zhuo Wenyu slipped past him under his arm.She appeared in the other end of the room. A faint green hue rapidly emerged on her skin all over her body. Her fingernails grew longer and sharper. Thick scales appeared on the back of her arms, which hung limply by her sides. Her pupils turned as black as night.\u201cI was careless earlier. But now, I\u2019ll show you what a true Spirit Demon-Possessed Body looks like\u2026!\u201d\u201cBOOM!!!\u201dBefore she completed her speech, she was once again slammed violently, as if by a rampaging elephant. Without any power to resist, she was once again sent flying outwards.This time, Lu Sheng had attacked with both sabers.With one stride, the floor of the bedroom quaked as he appeared several meters before Zhuo Wenyu in a flash, lightning-quick. He delivered two consecutive hacks of his giant sabers.\u201cBOOM BOOM!!!\u201dCopious amounts of green goo oozed out of Zhuo Wenyu\u2019s nose, mouth, and ears. Her head had been thoroughly smacked out of shape. Her body flew in an arc across the air before slamming squarely into the melted pill cauldron.\u201cDONG!\u201dBlood splattered all over like rain. This time, she was tossed and turned several rounds before landing on the floor. Wide-eyed and shell-shocked, she was frozen and unable to move.\u201cYou really can take blows,\u201d Lu Sheng walked over and grabbed her neck, lifted her up and shook her in the air. \u201cIn order not to damage any goods on you, I\u2019ve been using slaps. I didn\u2019t expect that it\u2019d take three slaps before immobilizing you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 what on earth are you!?\u201d Zhuo Wenyu gnashed her teeth. She would rather die than believe that an ordinary mortal possessed the power to smack her out of her Spirit Demon-Possessed Body mode.\u201cI\u2019m just an ordinary mortal. Why don\u2019t you tell me what you are? What\u2019s this Spirit Demon-Possessed Body stuff about?\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s interest was aroused by his first encounter with a mutant like Zhuo Wenyu.\u201cYou don\u2019t know about us?\u201d Zhuo Wenyu was stunned, her blood-streaked face incredulous.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Deep_Blue\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Kurisu\u201cI\u2019m supposed to know about you?\u201d Lu Sheng was surprised too.Now it was Zhuo Wenyu\u2019s turn to be dumbstruck. This dude didn\u2019t know a single thing and yet walloped her all the same.It was a good thing that she was experienced in dealing with many different types of situations and was able to react rapidly. With a turn of her eyeballs, she said, \u201cLet me go, and I can gather some intelligence on Scarlet District for you. Zhen Family isn\u2019t in a very good shape now, trust me. Letting me go does you more good than harm.\u201d\u201cGive me this thing on your neck. If you\u2019ve got similar stuff, I can consider letting you go,\u201d Lu Sheng pointed at a pearl necklace beaded through with a metal string on her chest.\u201cDeal!\u201d Zhuo Wenyu was caught by surprise. The pearl necklace she was wearing wasn\u2019t any treasure. It was just slightly valuable because it was a dated necklace. She hadn\u2019t expected that her opponent would request for it.\u201cAnd that thing in the corpse\u2019 mouth. I want to take a look at it before deciding,\u201d Lu Sheng continued to bargain.To be honest, he didn\u2019t want to kill this person either. She was someone from Scarlet Tower, which meant she was from Scarlet District. Her understanding of ghosts would definitely far outstrip that of outsiders like them in Crimson Whale Sect.He hoped to find a method for breakthrough from her.\u201cThat thing isn\u2019t of any use to you. Only demons like us have any use for it,\u201d Zhuo Wenyu explained. Bizarrely, despite her grave injuries, she could still speak clearly and composedly, as if she were not affected by her severe injuries.\u201cAnd even for us, it\u2019s difficult to absorb this sort of corpse Qi. We need time to digest it.\u201d\u201cCorpse Qi?\u201d Realization dawned on Lu Sheng. Although he could feel that the thing in the corpse\u2019s mouth was peculiar, it was a very vague feeling rather than a clear detection.After all, had it not been for the Modifier, he would be no more than a mere mortal. Hence, apart from Yin Qi and inner Qi, he could not detect anything else.\u201cYou\u2019re very strong. Among mortals, you\u2019d be considered one of the small minority of the strongest experts. They term themselves the realm of Divine Prime and largely live in seclusion all over the world. How is it that you\u2019re so powerful and yet still involved in a sect such as this?\u201d Zhuo Wenyu asked.\u201cMy strength is at Divine Prime?\u201d Lu Sheng was astonished. He had only used Level Five of Ultimate Crimson Skill, with Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill and his hard body skill. Although his actual combat strength should surpass the old Sect Master\u2019s, but the difference should not be great. And yet she described his level as comparable to that of Divine Prime.\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Zhuo Wenyu countered. \u201cI\u2019ve once exchanged blows with a few Divine Prime experts. Their power was like yours.\u201d\u201cAlright, let\u2019s put that aside and look at what toy this is first,\u201d Lu Sheng stared at the pearl necklace on her neck.With a tug, Zhuo Wenyu ripped it off her neck and tossed it to Lu Sheng. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ve no idea what you want this stuff for. Apart from being slightly dated and worth a few more coins, it\u2019s just an ordinary necklace. If you want, I can get you a dozen of them.\u201d\u201cNaturally, I have my reasons for wanting it,\u201d Lu Sheng caught the necklace and walked to the corpse on the bed. One saber cut cleaved its head open, revealing the object in its mouth.It was a tiny black round cauldron with intricate patterns carved on its surface. It had six handles around it and was about the size of an egg, made of neither gold nor jade.Carefully, Lu Sheng lifted it up with the tip of his saber, then looked at Zhuo Wenyu. This woman\u2019s eyes shone with a green hue as she stared intently at the egg-sized cauldron.\u201cYou want this very much?\u201d The corners of Lu Sheng\u2019s mouth curved upwards.\u201cOf course,\u201d Zhuo Wenyu dispensed with all pretense.Lu Sheng sensed the Yin Qi emanating from the pearl necklace in his hand. \u201cIf you\u2019ve still got objects like the necklace, I\u2019ll gift you with this thing.\u201d\u201cFor real?\u201d Zhuo Wenyu frowned, befuddled. \u201cAre you sure you just want pearl necklaces like that?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not the necklace that I want. What I want are objects that are dated like this. Objects that are mostly burial items, ideally those worn directly on the dead, or in physical contact with them,\u201d Lu Sheng explained.Zhuo Wenyu bowed her head in thought.\u201cObjects like that\u2026 take a look and see if this counts?\u201d She retrieved a gold-threaded purse from her chest and passed it to Lu Sheng.Lu Sheng received it and was overjoyed to sense threads of Yin Qi coming from it. He knew it was a right decision to collaborate with this demoness.\u201cYes! Ten more of such items and I\u2019ll give you that thing.\u201d\u201cOk,\u201d Zhuo Wenyu agreed without hesitation.Surprised at the speed of her agreement, Lu Sheng instantly realized that he had set his price too low.\u201cEr no\u2026 I made a slip of the tongue,\u201d with a turn of his eyeballs, he chuckled, \u201cI want a hundred more of such items! A hundred of them and this treasure is yours!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Zhuo Wenyu stared at the bald man in front of him, seized by anger. \u201cYou cunning human! Don\u2019t go overboard!!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going overboard. I\u2019m merely selling high,\u201d Lu Sheng grinned. \u201cWho can help that you especially need this item?\u201dZhuo Wenyu glared at Lu Sheng for a long while. Eventually, however, she had to concede defeat. She truly needed this cauldron too desperately.\u201cA few dozen at most. These items are all antiques worth a hefty sum. And they\u2019re mostly beloved items. Any more and I won\u2019t be able to find it no matter how hard I look.\u201dLooking at her, Lu Sheng knew that she was telling the truth this time.\u201cCan you bring it to me all at one go? Item for item. Any problems?\u201d\u201cNo way! I need time to gather these items. They won\u2019t all come at the same time. Moreover, most of them are others\u2019 beloved items. I can bring it to you for you to take a look at it first. If you\u2019re certain that you want it, then I\u2019ll give it to you,\u201d initially, Zhuo Wenyu had thought that Lu Sheng was merely making a demand on the spur of the moment. But now it seemed to her that he truly desired those items and hence she felt that she had more bargaining space.\u201cHowever, if you have a long-term demand for such items, I can find you a stable source and be your business partner. But you\u2019ve got to help me collect some items that only people like you can lay hands on too.\u201d\u201cOh? Are you serious?\u201d Lu Sheng was hooked. The amount of Yin Qi on the pearl necklace was limited (there was only a bare thread of Yin Qi in it). It was equivalent to the powder left behind by the white-robed ghost that he had killed in the past\u2014sufficient for extrapolating an average foundational skill, but clearly inadequate for high-level martial arts. But if there were more such items, and even a stable supply of it, that was a different story.\u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d Zhuo Wenyu nodded. Her life was now in his hands and the wounds on her burned with pain. She would not lie to him.\u201cFine, it\u2019s a deal then,\u201d Lu Sheng picked up a random piece of cloth on the ground and lifted the cauldron with his saber tip, then placed it in the middle of the cloth and wrapped it up. Then he kept it and looked at Zhuo Wenyu, \u201cHow do we keep in touch hereafter?\u201d\u201cHow about right here? When I\u2019m here, I\u2019ll leave three stones in a triangle under that withered tree by the perimeter wall,\u201d Zhuo Wenyu said. \u201cYou can leave a sentry here.\u201dThen, she reached behind her neck and tore a small piece of her flesh along her wound and passed it to Lu Sheng, \u201cThis is for you. If you need to reach me, just burn it.\u201dLu Sheng received the chunk of flesh with the saber tip and scrutinized it. Satisfied that it was not poisoned, he used the earlier piece of rag and wrapped it snugly into a parcel.Neither the necklace nor the purse contained much Yin Qi. From the time he had received them till now, they were nearly entirely drained clean. Add to that the Yin Qi from the ghost that he previously slew, and he had enough for an upgrade of Ultimate Crimson Mantra.\u201cPleasure doing business with you. Oh, and you had best leave soon. I\u2019m gonna raze this place to the ground,\u201d Lu Sheng chuckled and left with the cauldron.He did not care about how Zhuo Wenyu was going to leave. In a few steps, he walked past the courtyard and out of the main entrance. Dry wood was heaped all around the perimeter wall with oil doused on them, as per Lu Sheng\u2019s instructions.Xu Chui stood waiting outside with a torch.\u201cWhat method of cleaning up beats razing it to the ground? Anyway, I\u2019ve razed it once. Why not a second time?\u201d Lu Sheng looked back and took the torch from Xu Chui\u2019s hand and tossed it casually on the dry wood by the door.Once the torch landed among the heaps of dry wood, it instantly lit up the oil doused over them. Yellow flames leaped up and spread like wildfire. Before long, thick columns of smoke billowed, enveloping the entire Song Manor.This time round, Lu Sheng had his men bring over massive amounts of dry wood specifically to raze this haunted place off the surface of the world. He was much better prepared than in case of the previous hastily lit fire.Zhuo Wenyu certainly had more secrets to hide. But, whatever, as long as she could supply him with Yin Qi items, Lu Sheng could not bother himself with her secrets.\u201cBig Bro, is this enough?\u201d Xu Chui asked softly. \u201cThat woman from before\u2026\u201d\u201cShe ran away. But she\u2019s gravely wounded by me so don\u2019t worry about her,\u201d Lu Sheng replied. \u201cLet\u2019s head back. Our business here is finished. Our men are still waiting outside.\u201d\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Xu Chui acknowledged with a bow of his head.Lu Sheng quickly led his men back to headquarters. After debriefing and reporting to old Sect Master, Hong Mingzi, on the Crimson Whale, he eagerly rushed back to Golden Jade Greenhouse.Most of the works in it had been completed. Because the tower was made of a composite of wood and bricks, the building speed was very fast and it was now ready for habitation.Lu Sheng thus moved out of his previous small apartment to a double-story apartment in the building.Once he entered the apartment, he headed straight for a quiet room designed for cultivating, locked the door and the windows, ordered that none was to disturb him, then sat down on a cushion in the room.\u2018This time I should be able to break through the limit of Ultimate Crimson Mantra and extrapolate it to new heights!\u2019 Lu Sheng was filled with anticipation.Ultimate Crimson Mantra was strong indeed. Earlier, just Level Five of the mantra coupled with Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill and his hard body skill was enough for him to whack Zhuo Wenyu, who was capable of holding her own against Divine Prime experts, half to death.If he had attacked at full strength\u2014Level Seven of Ultimate Crimson Mantra\u2014he was sure its might would be several folds stronger! Yet even such a level was still long ways away from the realm of Bind.But Lu Sheng sensed that he was drawing closer and closer to this boundary that separated mortals from Noblemen and Anomalies with each passing day.Sucking in a deep breath, he closed his eyes and called out, \u2018Deep Blue.\u2019\u201cSwish!\u201dA light blue screen emerged, floating silently before his eyes.A dialogue box jumped out immediately.\u2018Begin martial arts extrapolation?\u2019Lu Sheng composed himself to thwart his excitement. When he was completely in control of his emotions, he replied mentally,\u2018Yes.\u2019The dialogue box vanished in the blink of an eye.After confirming the decision to extrapolate, Lu Sheng felt once more the wonderful feeling that all the martial arts in the Modifier could be extrapolated and integrated.His line of sight immediately fell on Ultimate Crimson Mantra.\u2018Ultimate Crimson Mantra: Level Seven. Special Effect(s): Blood Web, Intensified Fire Poison, Six-Fold Tremor, Intensified Incendiary.\u2019 Indeed, a button for extrapolation appeared after it.Lu Sheng pressed the button gently within his mind, eager and shaking with anticipation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Quickly, the blurry words sharpened into focus again.\u2018Unnamed Mantra: Level Eight. Special Effect(s): Blood Web, High-Magnitude Tremor, Incendiary.\u2019Lu Sheng did not feel that his cultivation base had deepened particularly. But he could detect that some mysterious transformation seemed to have happened to his inner QI.The transformation heated up his body and caused his skin and scalp to itch, which seemed to be a sign that his hair was about to grow again.\u2018According to senior apprentice brother, once one steps into Divine Prime, one\u2019s body will enter a new stage of maturity. Perhaps my hair will grow back again then,\u2019 Lu Sheng sighed in relief. He did not wish to remain bald for the rest of his life.\u2018But it seems like my inner force after the breakthrough bears some resemblance with Blood Fury Skill\u2026 and some elements of Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill\u2019s strengthening and hardening effects.\u2019He carefully examined the difference in his inner Qi compared to previously.\u2018I wonder whether or not I\u2019ve actually broken out of my original realm. As for this new skill\u2026 since it\u2019s an integration of elements of Blood Fury Skill and Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill, I\u2019ll just call it Ultimate Crimson Nine Furies Skill.\u2019Having settled on a name, it gradually appeared in the Modifier.\u2018Ultimate Crimson Nine Furies Skill: Level Eight. Special Effect(s): Blood Web, High-Magnitude Tremor, Incendiary.\u2019\u2018Let\u2019s test it out first. After so much effort and such a long wait, I\u2019m sure my upgrade will be substantial, right?\u2019After resting for a little, he slowly rose.\u2018To test the limits of my current strength completely and yet still go unnoticed by others\u2026 the best way would be to find an opponent.\u2019Lu Sheng thought hard about where he could find an opponent on whom he could test out his strength.In the entire Northern Lands, the most powerful expert was his senior apprentice brother Hong Mingzi. The rest merely played second fiddle to him. Apart from them, there were the even more powerful ghosts and Anomalies. But fighting ghosts and Anomalies would be easily detected by Scarlet District and Zhen Family.\u2018Perhaps I can go find Li Shunxi. He\u2019s seen many things and been to many places. He should be able to help me find a suitable choice. Oh, and Zhuo Wenyu as well. As a non-human, she should know about ghosts and demons like these,\u2019 Lu Sheng considered for a moment. In the end, he decided to find Li Shunxi first. After all, Zhuo Wenyu belonged to a different species and would not be as easy to trick as Li Shunxi. It\u2019d be troublesome if she saw through his intention to test his strength.Exposing details about himself to outsiders was a dangerous thing to do.Knowing thine enemy guarantees victory. Hence, revealing details on himself to others was akin to providing others with the opportunity to effortlessly acquire information on himself. Such people, in such a world, died the soonest.He sprang into action immediately. After packing up, it was near evening.He had a subordinate fetch him a horse and rode on it straight into Mountain-Edge City.After entering the city, he headed towards the address given to him by Li Shunxi and quickly located a dead drunk Li Shunxi in a winery near his address.This lad sat in a corner, face as pale as paper, with a pool of vomit beside him. He was so stinky that other customers kept a wide berth around him. He was wearing robes that seemed to have not been laundered for many days. A sour stench filled Lu Sheng\u2019s nostrils as he walked near.\u201cDrink\u2026 a drink\u2026 isn\u2019t it just some coins\u2026 after this\u2026 I\u2019ll definitely\u2026 give you!\u201d Drunk as a skunk, Li Shunxi sat crookedly on a stool, a wine flask in his hand which he lifted to his mouth every other minute. With each mouthful of wine however, half of it would flow out of his mouth, soaking his neck and clothes.Lu Sheng stared at him with a frown and strode over to sit down opposite him.\u201cSir\u2026 would you erm\u2026 would you like to take your friend away? How are we going to carry on business with him like this\u2026\u201d seeing that Lu Sheng sat down, the store\u2019s owner hurried over to discuss with Lu Sheng. Both relief and helplessness was written all over his face.This drunkard had been here for three days. He had been paying, that\u2019s true. But, he was simply drinking too much for his own good. Moreover, he had spilled vomit all over the table and the floor. Even the waiter had cleaned up after him several times. It was affecting other customers.This scholarly young master clearly could not hold his alcohol\u2014as evidenced by his puking\u2014yet could not stop pouring wine into his mouth either.\u201cLeave it to me,\u201d Lu Sheng nodded.He grabbed the wine flask in Li Shunxi\u2019s hand, yanked it from him, and put it down on the table.\u201cBrother Li, you\u2019re drunk.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not drunk!\u201d Li Shunxi chuckled. \u201cEh, isn\u2019t this\u2026 isn\u2019t this Brother Lu? Why are\u2026 why are you here?\u201d His sentences were chopped up, starting and stopping, yet he still remained dead drunk.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the place to talk. Let\u2019s find a quiet place and have a good chat,\u201d Lu Sheng thought for a moment. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the Sky Blue Restaurant nearby, shall we? It\u2019s been a long time since I last met you, Brother Li. I was beginning to miss you and so came to visit you.\u201dHe grabbed onto Li Shunxi and lifted him by his collar, as if he was a chicken.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Brother Li. We\u2019ll get you washed up first. I\u2019ve still got a thing or two to consult you about.\u201d\u201cWine! I still want more wine!!!\u201dLu Sheng ignored his wail and lifted him out of the winery under countless stares of astonishment. Quickly, they entered the nearby Sky Blue Restaurant.The restaurant was, simply put, an asset under his name. It had belonged to Wu San, but now that Wu San was dead, it was his.Such properties belonged to the sect\u2019s public assets. He could distribute its profits, manage it, or enjoy any benefits from it. The one thing he could not do was to sell it away or transfer its ownership.They ordered a private room and, before long, Crimson Whale Sect\u2019s Soaring Eagle Squad dispatched men to guard the room, forbidding anyone from getting close to it.Settling Li Shunxi down on a chair, Lu Sheng sat across from him.\u201cBrother Li, what happened? What left you so down in the gutters!?\u201d Lu Sheng was befuddled.When compared to the handsome, charming, and fine Young Master that he was previously, the present Li Shunxi was basically like a beggar.Indeed, he was no different from a beggar now. His hair was unkempt and messy, his eyes bloodshot, his body emaciated; who knows how long it\u2019d been since his last proper rest. Dried sweat and mud stains covered his arms, neck and face.\u201cA toast~~?\u201d Li Shunxi lifted his cup towards Lu Sheng, walleyed.\u201cBrother Li, what on earth happened? There\u2019re no insurmountable challenges in life. If you\u2019re facing any difficulty, tell me. Perhaps I can lend you a hand,\u201d Lu Sheng felt that Li Shunxi was worth his investment and was of sound character. If the matter wasn\u2019t too troublesome, he did not mind lending a helping hand.At those words, Li Shunxi sobered up slightly, put his head down on the table and mumbled, \u201cBrother Lu\u2026. you can\u2019t help me\u2026 no one can\u2026\u201d he looked pitiful. Replacing wine with tea, he gulped it down cup after cup.Lu Sheng glanced at his robes.\u201cDid something happen at home?\u201d He remembered that Li Shunxi had once mentioned to him that he had a family member who was a high-ranking official in the court. But seeing as nobody from his family came to bring him back despite his current pathetic state, Lu Sheng surmised that it must have been one of two things: either he was out of love, or a mishap had happened at home.Li Shunxi trembled. He raised his head and looked at him, plastered.\u201cMy dad\u2026 he\u2019s dead\u2026\u201dLu Sheng was stunned. He grabbed a cup in his hand as his brows were knit in a furrow.Finally finding a confidant, Li Shunxi laughed tragically,\u201cYou\u2019re here to arrest me too, aren\u2019t you? Hahahah\u2026 even the person closest to me\u2026 the woman I\u2019ve loved for so long\u2026 even she could lace the wine. What can\u2019t happen in this world\u2026\u201d?\u201dAfter a few cups of cooling tea, he seemed to have come to his senses and was speaking much more clearly now.\u201cDid some mishap happen to your family?\u201d Lu Sheng asked.\u201cYea\u2026 my Dad was framed and executed a while back\u2026 my house was confiscated. People at home either ran away or dispersed. I was the only one who wasn\u2019t at home and so narrowly escaped the ordeal\u2026\u201d Li Shunxi described his tragedy. \u201cBrother Lu, if you\u2019ve come to arrest me on behalf of the authorities, then go ahead. I don\u2019t want to hide anymore. I\u2019m tired\u2026 exhausted\u2026\u201dLu Sheng frowned.\u201cWhat good would it do for me to arrest you and give you to the authorities? Money? You mean that little bit of reward offered by them? It\u2019s not enough to fill the gap in my teeth. Power? I\u2019m third-in-command of Crimson Whale Sect now. I\u2019m already a big-shot in Mountain-Edge City.Brother Li, don\u2019t give up on yourself like that. I haven\u2019t come to arrest you.Your family met with a tragedy. I guess we\u2019re considered half a friend to each other. If there\u2019s any help you need, all you have to do is ask. I\u2019ll do whatever is within my ability. But I\u2019ve got a small condition.\u201dLi Shunxi was stunned. He and Lu Sheng were merely acquaintances\u2014strangers who chanced upon each other in Song Manor and had a chat. Strictly speaking, they weren\u2019t even friends. And yet this man seemed to harbor no intention of arresting him at all.\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re truly not here to arrest me!?\u201d He remained in disbelief. \u201cYou need to understand that the one my Dad offended was the court\u2019s Secretary of the Army! A Grade-One top official!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care what grade he\u2019s in. It\u2019s none of my business. Alright, let\u2019s cut the crap. I\u2019ve come to buy a piece of intelligence from you. What intelligence do you have regarding any notorious ghosts, Anomalies or demons\u2026 etc., in the vicinity?\u201d Lu Sheng cut straight to the chase and stated his request. Crimson Whale Sect did have its own sources of intelligence, but Li Shunxi was clearly more in the know about such stuff.When it came to the supernatural world, Crimson Whale Sect merely monitored the situation, whereas Li Shunxi had personally made contact with it.\u201cHuh???\u201d Li Shunxi was stumped. \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re really not arresting me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t stand to benefit from it at all, so what\u2019s the point in me arresting you?\u201d Lu Sheng said in frustration. \u201cTragedy struck in your family and I sympathize. However, as long as you\u2019re still alive, you\u2019ll have the chance one day to avenge them. What good is there for a man like you to be bawling and crying!\u201dLi Shunxi stared at him blankly, dumbstruck. The betrayals he had experienced during this period of time were practically enough for him to write a novel.Each of the buddies and friends and playmates he had grown up with\u2026 even the love of his life with whom he had sworn eternal love\u2026Each of them had betrayed him. Each of them had cast him into the pits of despair. Each time, he survived with a harrowing escape. Until now, the arrow which had been buried in his back broke his heart into pieces. Had it not been for the life-saving item left to him by his Master, he would be rotting away by now.Running and hiding along the way, he made it to Mountain-Edge City. But his heart was filled with despair and he had given up on life. All he wanted to do was to die, drunk in a winery. Little did he expect that he would meet Lu Sheng.What he expected even less was that this stranger whom he had met only once had no intention of arresting him at all. Presently, he had nothing on him at all and was frail and weak. The drunken stupor had chipped away at his strength completely. It was a golden opportunity to arrest him; he merely had to drag him to the yamen on which was posted a warrant for him.But Lu Sheng did no such thing. Instead, he offered him help with anything that he needed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In that moment, Li Shunxi felt a myriad of complicated emotions.\u201cBrother Lu\u2026 I have this map that you seek. However, it\u2019s no longer of any use now. The raging war between the two main factions of the North have wreaked dreadful havoc outside the city\u2026 I\u2019m not sure what actually happened, but this map from before is no longer of any use. The Noble Families have made their move\u2026\u201dHis words did, however, remind Lu Sheng that the current state of chaos from the battle between the Zhen Family and the Scarlet District would naturally have resulted in confusion among the demons, devils, ghosts, and the like.\u201cThat\u2019s troublesome\u2026\u201d in that case, he couldn\u2019t even find himself a suitable target for testing. It was rather bothersome.\u201cBrother Lu, er\u2026 could you lend me some travel money\u2026?\u201d Li Shunxi asked hesitatingly, somewhat embarrassed. He was thoroughly sober by now. Actually, he hadn\u2019t drunk much; most of the wine had actually been spilled by him. Therefore, he sobered up quickly.\u201cSmall thing,\u201d Lu Sheng retrieved his wallet from his waist pouch, which he threw straight at Li Shunxi. \u201cThis is what I have on me now, you take and use it.\u201dHe didn\u2019t care much for these eighty or so taels of silver. Now that he was in the upper echelons of Crimson Whale Sect, his income channels had expanded greatly, which allowed him to be a lot more extravagant with his spending. Li Shunxi was a decent guy who was worth building up connections with. It was reasonable to fork out this small sum to sow his favor.As for the earlier incident at the weapons section, although he had the money, no one liked being fooled and taken advantage of. That\u2019s why he had deliberately messed around with that old man.Li Shunxi\u2019s face was awash with gratitude as he accepted the pouch. Opening it and scanning across its contents, the silver notes and coins amounted to no less than a hundred taels.\u201cMany thanks, Brother Lu! This Li will remember your kindness for as long as I live!\u201d He responded somberly.\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, Brother Li. We\u2019re all bound to be down-and-out at some point,\u201d Lu Sheng gestured. \u201cRight, so what exactly happened to your family\u2026?\u201dLi Shunxi\u2019s face darkened at the mention of this matter.\u201cBrother Lu, have you heard of Duke Ashoka before?\u201d\u201cDuke Ashoka?\u201d Lu Sheng shook his head, \u201cIs he some sort of royal duke in the imperial government?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. However, he\u2019s not just some royalty. He\u2019s actually secretly a terrifyingly powerful personage, and it\u2019s not just ordinary worldly power he wields,\u201d Li Shunxi sighed. \u201cMy dad was investigating him as the former was suspected of offering blood sacrifices to the evil spirits. Because of that, he was framed by the soldiers and officials, resulting in such straits.\u201d\u201cDuke Ashoka\u2026 blood sacrifice?\u201d Lu Sheng faintly recalled that tragic incident in Nine Links City.When the entire Xu Family, an illustrious family of the Nine Links City, was wiped out, there had been rumors that it was a blood sacrifice. He hesitated before asking with a frown, \u201cHas it got something to do with that tragic blood sacrifice incident in Nine Links City?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Li Shunxi nodded, his face glum. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Nine Links City. There were a total of eight such massacres across the North, all of which were shockingly horrifying. Furthermore, there were many villages outside the city that disappeared one by one. In actual fact, the total death toll reached way higher than those from the murder cases combined.It\u2019s precisely because of this that my dad could bear it no longer, and decided to investigate thoroughly into the matter. Who knew\u2026\u201d his eyes reddened as his voice trailed off.\u201cDuke Ashoka\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s eyes narrowed. In that case, the Xu Family blood sacrifice incident in Nine Links City wasn\u2019t simply the work of the supernatural, nor was it merely linked to the Mortal Sweeping Manor\u2014added to it was that Duke Ashoka guy.\u201cAccording to what my dad found out, Duke Ashoka very likely has links to the ghost factions, and quite impressive ones at that. It\u2019s atrocious just thinking about it,\u201d Li Shunxi explained. \u201cHe\u2019s not of the same bloodline as the current imperial family, but rather received a royal position that was handed down from the previous government. Because he has always kept a low profile, no one knew him well. This time round, however, the blood sacrifices were way too cruel, and thus were unearthed by my dad.\u201d\u201cThere was a major war in the North a while back when they fought for some treasure\u2014he must have had a hand in that too?\u201d Lu Sheng asked again. It was rare that he had such an excellent opportunity to gather some insider information; naturally, he had to make the most of it to gain some clarity.\u201cThat I\u2019m not sure of. What I know for certain, however, is that he must have been involved somehow,\u201d Li Shunxi nodded vigorously. He poured himself a cup of water, which he gulped down in one mouthful.\u201cAlright. As the mountain stands and river flows, we\u2019ll meet again. Brother Lu, I, Li Shunxi, will remember this favor, and definitely repay you when the opportunity arises in the future! Farewell!\u201dLu Sheng could see through his intentions, and did not try to keep him.Li Shunxi didn\u2019t want to implicate him. After all, Duke Ashoka and the Minister of the Army belonged to a level of power that an ordinary man could not compare to.Even though Lu Sheng said on the surface that these things didn\u2019t bother him, if he were really up against such impressive powers, then it would be impossible for his family to survive even if he himself could find a way out. His entire family would be implicated.\u201cBrother Li, take care\u2026\u201d Lu Sheng sighed again as he rose and cupped his fists in response.\u201cTill we meet again,\u201d Li Shunxi grasped onto the money pouch that Lu Sheng had given him. It almost seemed as if what he was grabbing onto was not money, but something that reignited a sense of newfound faith and purpose in his life.He opened the door and strode off. Only when the door had shut behind him for a while did Lu Sheng slowly get up from his seat.\u201cFriend, since you\u2019ve heard it all, you may as well come out now. Don\u2019t make me welcome you personally,\u201d Lu Sheng\u2019s voice rang out clearly as he stood there alone in the empty chamber.\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d an aged voice sounded out near Lu Sheng\u2019s ear. \u201cMeeting personally with a wanted convict \u2026 aren\u2019t you worried of implicating your entire household?\u201d\u201cImplicating? Whom did I meet with? I haven\u2019t done anything but receive a friend. What wanted convict?\u201d Lu Sheng asked with a blank expression.\u201cThat Li Shunxi is a wanted criminal hunted down by the authorities. You\u2019re strong. Don\u2019t put your feet in the wrong place,\u201d the old voice said flatly. \u201cOtherwise, at the very best, you\u2019ll find trouble on your hands; at the very worst, you will be exterminated.\u201dSuch gall!Lu Sheng\u2019s expression changed almost imperceptibly. Inwardly, however, his mood darkened. Someone had indeed been keeping a watch on Li Shunxi, although he hadn\u2019t expected that he would receive a warning that soon.\u201cExterminated? Hehe,\u201d He gave a sinister laugh. \u201cI dare you to come out and try, see if you can exterminate me.\u201dThreads of a threatening aura emitted out slowly from his body.Even he himself was in the dark about the prowess of the eighth level of Ultimate Crimson Nine-Furies Skill. It was quite a good timing\u2014he could now test it out on an expert.\u201cArrogant brat!\u201d That aged voice was seething. Immediately following the trail of his voice, a steel needle, as fine as cow\u2019s hair, pierced through the walls to aim straight for Lu Sheng\u2019s chest.The steel needle moved soundlessly at a blinding speed, which was further shrouded in the sound of the voice. By the time Lu Sheng noticed it, it was already too late for him to duck.\u201cPU!\u201dThe silver needle slammed itself viciously against his chest.Yet even before the poison on the needle could activate, a massive chopper the size of a door slashed unrelentingly onto the chamber\u2019s left wall.\u201cBOOM!!!\u201dThe wall was crushed into smithereens, revealing a skinny elderly in green robes. With no time to evade the attack, he was slashed brutally by the chopper. The countless wooden fragments from the attack showered upon him like an explosion, causing him to bleed profusely from many wounds in a split second.\u201cHA!!!\u201d Lu Sheng exclaimed loudly. He leapt across, aimed the tip of his saber against the man\u2019s neck, and brought it down viciously.\u201cPU!!!\u201dHis entire body knocked the elderly man over, the tip of his saber slicing cleanly through his neck into the ground. The elderly\u2019s chin and chest were almost separated into two.The elderly struggled feebly as he was pinned to the ground. Blood pooled at his mouth, causing him to produce choking sounds. He stared fixedly at Lu Sheng. Extending his arms, he tried to grasp onto the saber to pull it out, but it was utterly useless.\u201cExterminate me? YOU?\u201d Lu Sheng grabbed onto the elderly\u2019s hair and lifted him upwards.\u201cCHI. \u201dHis head was sliced neatly into two halves. Henceforth, not a sound more escaped from the elderly man\u2019s mouth.Blood flowed everywhere. Only now did the Crimson Whale Sect members outside notice that and rush into the chamber. Upon witnessing that sight, the faces of each and every one of them turned ashen.\u201cBoss\u2026\u201d covering his nose, Xu Chui walked into the room. The pungent stench from the sheer amount of blood that covered the room caused discomfort even for someone like him, who had witnessed countless battles.\u201cTidy up. Cremate this body directly and don\u2019t leave behind any clues,\u201d Lu Sheng said plainly. Casually, he retrieved the needle from his chest, which had been bent into his robes. This needle didn\u2019t even scratch him after it pierced the wall to land on him, much less did its poison manage to take effect.\u201cYes, sir.\u201dLu Sheng wiped off the blood that had stained his shoes with a towel, then strode out of the restaurant.Previously, he had felt a barely discernible aura that approached and followed Li Shunxi wherever he went. Initially, he had even thought that it belonged to an expert tasked with protecting him. Who knew that it was actually a spy.He couldn\u2019t risk the contents of his discussion with Li Shunxi leaking. Moreover, the other party actually had the guts to threaten him. In a fit of anger, he threw all caution to the wind and decided to slaughter that man.It was merely the Fifth Level of Ultimate Crimson Nine-Furies Skill, working in tandem with the hard body skills. Yet, the explosive power that resulted was like earlier, which left someone roughly at the Intent Proficiency level with no time to even react before he was slashed to death.\u2018In that case, I am still unable to determine exactly what level of skill I am at right now,\u2019 Lu Sheng remained deep in thought as he left the restaurant.After he returned to the Golden Jade Greenhouse, he retrieved from below his mattress a box with small vials, ones that he had used for his experiments previously.The Bind alcohol inside these little vials could probably provide him with enough data to make a rough assessment of the level of Bind poison he could stand up against given his current power.Lu Sheng took out a small vial as he sat at the round table. Placing it in his hand, he left the other vials in the white box and placed it on the tabletop for the moment.\u2018I\u2019ve got no choice but to experiment with this for the moment\u2026\u2019Gingerly, he retrieved the wooden stopper and tilted it to release its contents slowly into his palm.Very soon, a drop of black liquid flowed out unhurriedly along the tilt of the vial to fall onto his palm.\u201cSzzz\u2026\u201dWhite smoke billowed out. A strong acrid stench of something burnt spread out, as if it were concentrated acid that had been poured onto his palm.Lu Sheng looked at that black substance, which swiftly shrank and disappeared from within his hand. Then, he promptly moved on to the liquid in the next vial.His inner Qi circulated strongly within him, with no sign of exhaustion. The quality of the Ultimate Crimson Nine-Furies Skill was clearly superior to before; previously, it had been too powerless to defend against the Bind power of a single vial.The second drop of liquid also vanished in a flash, entirely evaporating into steam. Then, the third, the fourth, the fifth\u2026 vial after vial of the liquid was dripped onto the same spot.Swiftly, over half of the Ultimate Crimson Nine-Furies Skill inner Qi had been expended. Very soon, Yin-Yang Jade Crane Skill power was activated, alongside a combination of the hard body skill, Nine Lakes Steel Chains Skill.Threads of white smoke drifted out from the top of Lu Sheng\u2019s head; it was the water vapor from his perspiration, which had been scorched into steam by his inner Qi.The sixth vial, the seventh\u2026 Lu Sheng picked up the eighth vial; this was the last one.His inner Qi had stood up against and fully counteracted with the poison in the first seven vials of liquid. However, by this time, all of the inner Qi that was within Lu Sheng had sadly been wiped out.In the end, he held the eighth vial in his fingers but did not continue to pour out its contents.\u2018I was able to resist the poison in seven vials. Soon\u2026 very soon\u2026 only a little bit left to go,\u2019 Lu Sheng\u2019s heart surged, his head damp with perspiration.He surmised that all it took was one more level of upgrade for his inner force skills before he would be able to break through and achieve the level of Bind.Although this was the most basic\u2014the lowest\u2014level among the Noblemen and the Anomalies, it represented the widest of chasms between the ordinary mortals and the supernatural.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
