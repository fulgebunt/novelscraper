If anything, it all felt like a joke to me.\u201d\u201cMaterialists like ourselves naturally have nothing to be afraid of! Ghosts aren\u2019t real!\u201d\u201cI hate to say it, but I told you so. We should have stayed at the hostel; I was so close to gaining another level on my online game.\u201dA group of students grumbled with disappointment in front of Western Jiujiang City\u2019s House of Horrors before they left on their motorbikes. Chen Ge, who held a stack of advertisement flyers for the Haunted House, shook his head despondently when he saw this.The art of scaring was a skill, but with the introduction of scary movies, many modern-day citizens\u2019 threshold for scares had been increased. A visit to the Haunted House was no different from a stroll in one\u2019s own backyard.\u201cBoss!\u201dA clear female voice erupted from behind him. Chen Ge turned around and saw a slender \u2018zombie\u2019 in a nurse outfit running out of the Haunted House in a fit of anger.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Xiao Wan?\u201d The zombie\u2019s name was Xu Wan; she was one of the temporary actors hired by the Haunted House.\u201cThose few ruffians earlier, they tried to take advantage of me!\u201d the girl hissed through gritted teeth, her fists gripped tight.So, it is merely to complain\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s horrible; they wouldn\u2019t even leave a zombie in peace.\u201d As the boss, naturally Chen Ge was on Xiao Wan\u2019s side. \u201cLater, I\u2019ll have the amusement park manager to pull up the surveillance footage.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. When I realized their intentions, my punch went flying straight at the boy\u2019s face.\u201d Xu Wan pointed at the bloodstain at the edge of her outfit and exclaimed rather proudly, \u201cSee, this isn\u2019t fake blood.\u201d\u201cGood, good, a girl should learn how to protect herself.\u201d Chen Ge wiped the cold sweat from his forehead. As he turned to look at the setting sun, he said, \u201cI suppose it\u2019s time to call it a day. We probably won\u2019t have any more visitors, so help me go and tell everyone that we can get off work early today.\u201dHowever, he realized the girl in zombie make-up didn\u2019t make an attempt to move away.\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d\u201cBoss\u2026\u201d Xu Wan hesitated before pulling two letters out from her pocket slowly. \u201cThese are the resignation letters from Tao Ming and Xiao Wei. You\u2019ve been a great boss to them, so they didn\u2019t have to the face to give these to you in person and had me pass them to you.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re quitting?\u201d Chen Ge asked the obvious question as he accepted the letters, then he added, \u201cEveryone has their own dream to chase, so be it. Xiao Wan, you can leave now if there\u2019s nothing else.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go remove the make-up first.\u201dAfter the cute little zombie left, Chen Ge lit a cigarette silently. Half a year ago, when his parents mysteriously disappeared, the only thing they left him was this Haunted House. To keep their memory alive, Chen Ge had resigned from his day-job to focus on managing this Haunted House.Alas, times were changing. Despite the niche genre, there was huge competition among Haunted Houses, and there were plenty of limitations as well. A scary scenario would lose its scare factor after the initial experience, but a constant update would require plenty of resources and money.Starting from a few weeks ago, the Haunted House had been in the red; the income from the daily ticket sales barely covered the electricity and water expenses.\u201cI wonder how long I can hold on.\u201dAfter extinguishing the cigarette, when Chen Ge was prepared to return to the Haunted House, a middle-aged man wearing the uniform for New Century Park walked toward him. When he saw him, Chen Ge increased his pace like a mouse spotting a cat.\u201cYou think you can pretend to have not seen me?\u201d The middle-aged man clamped his hands on Chen Ge\u2019s shoulders. \u201cToday, we definitely need to talk it out. You\u2019ve owed the rent and utilities for two months already. The top brass are breathing down my neck to pursue it, so pay up!\u201d\u201cUncle Xu, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to pay you, but I really have nothing to pay you with. Can you please give me another month?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what you told me last month!\u201d\u201cI promise, this is definitely the last time!\u201d Chen Ge patted his chest as he promised with sincerity.\u201cPeople have already moved on from Haunted Houses. Listen to me, it\u2019s no use being this stubborn.\u201d When the middle-aged man named Uncle Xu saw the letters in Chen Ge\u2019s hand, the force on Chen Ge\u2019s shoulders gradually lightened. \u201cYou\u2019re so young; you can still begin anew with a different career, so why are you doing this to yourself?\u201d\u201cUncle Xu, I know you\u2019re just looking out for me, but this Haunted House carries a different meaning for me. I guess I\u2019m still unwilling to let the last memory of my parents go,\u201d Chen Ge uttered in a lowered voice as if he was afraid that other people might hear him.As the amusement park manager, the middle-aged man knew about the disappearance of Chen Ge\u2019s parents. He didn\u2019t answer immediately. After a few seconds, he sighed and said, \u201cFine, I can understand how you feel. I\u2019ll try my best to talk to management for you and see if they can give you a few more weeks.\u201d\u201cThank you, Uncle Xu!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t thank me so soon, you\u2019d better make sure you can increase the ticket sales or the ending will just be the same.\u201dAfter sending the amusement park manager off, Chen Ge returned to the Haunted House and started his daily routine of checking the equipment, maintaining the items, and cleaning.\u201cThe fake blood in the maintenance room is almost empty; I have to buy a new batch.\u201cIf this corridor could be made slightly more slanted to the side, it\u2019ll create a better blind spot to scare the visitors.\u201cOh no, this puppet is broken already; I\u2019ll have to repair it later.\u201cF*ck! What happened to the lightbulb I installed here last week? Who has stolen it\u203d\u201dIn the eyes of an outsider, he was the owner of a Haunted House, a young entrepreneur in a way, but only Chen Ge himself could understand the difficulty behind maintaining a Haunted House. Haunted Houses were a kind of entertainment. Caught within a scary environment, one\u2019s physical and mental situation would be maintained at a heightened state, but when the stress was released, it would lead to a sense of relief and satisfaction; it was not unlike a massage in a way.At the same time, most Haunted Houses were one-trick ponies. The most effective business method for a Haunted House was to have it be mobile so that it would constantly attract fresh batches of visitors. A Haunted House that was stuck at a certain location like Chen Ge\u2019s had to have immense popularity to lure in the crowds, or else they wouldn\u2019t be able to survive for long. The fact that he had managed to hold on for so long was already, in a way, a miracle.Dragging the puppet that was ruined, Chen Ge entered the maintenance room. He had studied Toy Design in college, and the machinery and traps used in the Haunted House had been all personally designed and built by him. The maintenance process, which included sewing and repainting, was dry and repetitive.\u201cStill missing some fake blood. If I remember correctly, there\u2019s still some stock in the attic.\u201d The Haunted House was separated into three floors; the first and second floors were for haunted scenarios while the third was a storeroom.After pushing open the wooden door, behind the haze of wood chips and dust, there were various kinds of materials and unwanted ingredients left behind by Chen Ge\u2019s parents from when they had managed the Haunted House.Unwilling to face the past, Chen Ge rarely came up to this place.\u201cNow that I think about it, it has almost been half a year already.\u201dLooking at the various equipment, Chen Ge was reminded of his childhood. At the time, his family had managed a mobile Haunted House, so he had gotten the chance to travel the country with his parents. When the two adults were busy, they would leave Chen Ge alone backstage to accompany the various ghosts, so Chen Ge\u2019s unnatural guts had been trained since he was young.After all, when his friends of the same age were playing with blocks and puzzles, he was running around with a fake human head.\u201cThese are all precious memories.\u201dChen Ge wandered aimlessly before finding himself back at the wooden box that kept the few things that remained of his parents. Inside sat a black cell phone and a rough-looking doll. The doll was the first toy Chen Ge made when he was a child, but he had zero recollection of the phone. Both of these items had been found in an abandoned hospital in the countryside, and regarding why Chen Ge\u2019s parents would go there in the middle of the night, even the police couldn\u2019t give him an answer.\u201cWhere are the two of you?\u201d Chen Ge picked up the doll and pinched its chubby face. Then, with a sigh, he told himself, \u201cI\u2019d better go find that fake blood. If I cannot survive this off season, I really will have to bid this Haunted House farewell.\u201dChen Ge was talking to himself, but when he said so, the black phone, which had been silent in the box, suddenly lit up with a dim, cold light.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Dark technology or supernatural phenomenon?\u201d If this happened to someone else, that person probably would have raced out screaming bloody murder already, but in comparison, Chen Ge\u2019s reaction was much calmer. He picked up the phone and inspected it closer.\u201cThis is weird. I\u2019ve tried opening this phone more than a hundred times before, but it wouldn\u2019t work, so why did it open by itself today? This phone was found where my parents disappeared, so could it be that they know I\u2019m in trouble and are contacting me to help?\u201dChen Ge swiped the phone open, and on the front page with a black background, there was only one available app. It had the shape of a Haunted House as an icon.\u201cWait\u2026 This looks so familiar, just like the front entrance of my own Haunted House!\u201dWith a frown, Chen Ge clicked the app open, and a row of letters written in what appeared to be blood appeared on screen\u2014Do you believe there are ghosts in this world?Objectively speaking, this was a metaphysical philosophical question; for an engineering student like Chen Ge, it was practically unanswerable.\u201cThere should be,\u201d Chen Ge mumbled to himself, and a few seconds later, a new sentence appeared on screen.\u201cWhat you believe is the answer. From this moment on, you will officially take over as the new owner of the Haunted House. Of course, this is not something worth celebrating. Before the end of the tutorials, please heed my last advice: suicide is the most cowardice of behavior, and try your best to survive!\u201d\u201cWhat and what? But this pompous way of speech does resemble that father of mine.\u201dChen Ge clicked on the app again, and a new window appeared._______________Western Jiujiang Haunted HouseStatus: Almost ClosingGood Reputation: ZeroDaily Visitor Number: FourMonthly Visitor Number: TenMy Team of Ghosts and Ghouls: NoneMy Item Storage: NoneUnlocked Achievement: NoneCurrent Available Scenarios [Set Pieces]:\u2013 Night of the Living Dead \u2013 Horrible prop, untrained actors, the plot has no readable storyline or logic.

This gave Chen Ge a weird sensation, as if the Haunted House managed in-game was no different from the one he was managing in real life.They were both down on their luck and facing closure; there were simply too many similarities between them.\u201cCould it be that this game is built using my Haunted House as its basis? Then does this mean that if there\u2019re changes in the game, it\u2019ll also happen in real life?\u201d Chen Ge muttered.Chen Ge continued to read; the current scenario of the Haunted House, Night of the Living Dead, was brutally criticized. Even the Minghun scenario that got onto the papers before only managed to get a 0.5-star rating.\u201cIf Minghun only gets 0.5 star, I shudder to imagine how scary those unlockable scenarios are.\u201d He tried to click on the options, and when he did, a window appeared on screen, telling him that he needed to finish a certain number of daily missions before he would be able to unlock the scenarios.\u201cLooks like the daily missions are the key to this; it is only by completing daily missions that I\u2019ll be able to unlock the haunted scenarios. By unlocking more scenarios, I\u2019ll be able to attract more customers and, consequently, expand the Haunted House.\u201d Chen Ge was an avid player of mobile games, so he soon grasped the rules of the game\u2014the rate of completion for daily missions was going to influence the development of the Haunted House.After clicking on Daily Missions, three options surfaced:Easy Mission: There are three main elements to the design of a good Haunted House\u2014Story, Scenario, and Mood. A Haunted House without a story is a Haunted House without a soul, please complete the background story to the two scenarios, Night of the Living Dead and Minghun.Normal Mission: Fix all the mannequins inside the Haunted House before midnight.Nightmare Mission: I know you\u2019re still not wholly convinced about the existence of ghost in the world; in that case, how about a little game? The truth will be revealed when you open your eyes.Daily Missions will refresh every day at midnight. User can only apply for one mission each day, and the reward corresponds to the difficulty of the mission.(Beware! The more difficult the mission, the more dangerous it\u2019ll be, so please choose carefully!)After looking through the mission details, Chen Ge gasped with surprise. \u201cThe missions in the game have to be completed in real life? Isn\u2019t this the perfect proof that this game can influence real life\u203d\u201dTo test this speculation, he decided to pick a mission. Since the reward was given according to difficulty and he could only pick one each day, for the sake of the biggest reward, he had to pick the most difficult mission. However, the warning attached to the end of the missions did make Chen Ge worry.\u201cThis is hard to choose. The description for the Nightmare Mission is so vague; it just speaks of a trap. Why don\u2019t I start with a Normal Mission? Fixing all the props will be difficult but not impossible.\u201dChen Ge was a man of action, after he had made the decision, he started to move. He grabbed his toolbox and a bucket of unopened fake blood and started to inspect all the mannequins around the Haunted House.Night had fallen. To save electricity, Chen Ge didn\u2019t even leave the lights in the corridors open. Squeezing a flashlight in his armpit, Chen Ge twisted through the large Haunted House, fixing all the mannequins that needed his attention.If there were any outsiders who saw this, they would probably be so spooked that they would call the cops directly.\u201cI really didn\u2019t expect so many mannequins will require maintenance; I should not have slacked off earlier!\u201dAt 11:45 pm, Chen Ge received the mission completion alert on his phone. \u201cYou\u2019ve completed the Normal Mission. Paying attention to details will contribute to the perfect scary atmosphere. Congratulations, you\u2019ve gained the mission reward\u2014Background Music, Black Friday.\u201d\u201cWait, wasn\u2019t Black Friday a banned song in foreign countries? According to rumors, it has the uncanny ability to instill suicidal tendencies in its listeners, and the original score was lost a long time ago.\u201d Chen Ge discovered the picture of a CD in his item storage. \u201cWhat kind of mission reward is this, don\u2019t tell me this is all some kind of prank?\u201dHe clicked on the CD image, and a melody that he had not heard of started playing beside his ears. The melody spoke of darkness, melancholy, and loneliness. Chen Ge felt the world around him falling away, and he had landed himself in a long corridor with no end in sight.When the song ended, Chen Ge\u2019s back was drenched in cold sweat. He was thankful he didn\u2019t choose to have the song on repeat or else he really didn\u2019t think he would have been able to escape the influence of the music on his own.\u201cF*ck, this is real! This should be the original track!\u201d After completing the game mission, he really did acquire a reward that he could use in real life. This gave Chen Ge a ray of hope. He stopped the music and saved it carefully. After dealing with everything, Chen Ge returned to the break room to rest.Lying in bed, even though he was tired, he didn\u2019t feel at all sleepy. After all, the things that he had experienced that day required a bit of time to digest.Without knowing it, it soon passed midnight, and Chen Ge was still staring aimlessly at the ceiling.\u201cCan\u2019t sleep at all!\u201d The man who was bored out of his mind pulled out the black phone. \u201cMidnight has passed, so there should be a new set of Daily Missions, right?\u201dHe opened the app, and as he expected, there were some changes on the Daily Missions screen.Easy Mission: If you want to provide the visitors a scary experience, then first you have to pay notice to the rhythm and tempo of their experience in the Haunted House. Setting off the scare too early might cause the visitors to lose their interest, so I suggest you install some sound detectors or surveillance cameras in the Haunted House to keep track of your visitors\u2019 progress.Normal Mission: A single hand cannot clap; a good Haunted House requires a good team to run it. Recruit more talents to aid in your journey.Nightmare Mission: I know you\u2019re still not wholly convinced about the existence of ghost in the world; in that case, how about a little game? The truth will be revealed when you open your eyes.Daily Missions will refresh every day at midnight. User can only apply for one mission each day, and the reward corresponds to the difficulty of the mission.(Beware! The more difficult the mission, the more dangerous it\u2019ll be, so please choose carefully!)Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe three new Daily Missions put some kinks in Chen Ge\u2019s plan.The easy mission was to install new surveillance devices in the Haunted House; this could be done with money, but the issue was\u2026 Chen Ge\u2019s budget was currently limited.The normal mission also wasn\u2019t that easy for Chen Ge. His two senior workers, who had been through thick and thin with him, had just resigned. Even if he went to set up a recruitment ad right this moment, it would require days to complete the training. When the new employee could help at the Haunted House, the place probably would have closed already.Since the easy mission and normal mission were impossible, Chen Ge\u2019s eyes settled on the last Daily Mission.\u201cSince the harder the mission, the better the reward, shall I give this Nightmare Mission a try?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The truth will be revealed when you open your eyes.\u201dAs mentioned earlier, the description of the Nightmare Mission was incredibly vague; it did, however, give off a creepy vibe.\u201cLooking at the introduction, it should involve some kind of game, but how can playing a game be a Nightmare Mission?\u201dTo finish the Normal Mission, Chen Ge had worked non-stop for several hours. He had barely managed to finish fixing all the mannequins. As he toyed with the phone, Chen Ge\u2019s sense of curiosity was aroused. \u201cShall I try it out?\u201dThe moment the thought appeared, it grew and expanded like vines invading every corner of his mind.\u201cNightmare Missions give the best reward, and since I can\u2019t accomplish the Easy and Normal Missions provided today, this is my best bet.\u201dThe Haunted House would close if he was unable to survive this off season. Chen Ge knew how precarious his situation was. It was a pure stroke of luck that he had stumbled upon this ray of hope, so of course, he wouldn\u2019t let any opportunities pass by easily.\u201cSo be it. After all, eventually, I\u2019ll have to apply for a Nightmare Mission, so why not now\u203d\u201d Sitting up in bed, Chen Ge clicked on the last mission.\u201cAre you sure you wish to accept the Nightmare Mission? After acceptance, unknown circumstances might occur.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe phone flashed, and the real mission details surfaced.\u201cIt requires plenty of courage, incredible luck, and a bit of help to see the hidden world. The game we\u2019re playing is called \u2018Another You in the Mirror\u2019. Enter the bathroom alone at 2:04 am, close the door, and turn off the lights. Face the mirror and light a candle between yourself and it. Then, close your eyes and focus; you can then begin by slowly chanting your name.\u201cAnything can happen in the dark; perhaps there will be an unfamiliar face that appears in the mirror, or there might be a pair of eyes lurking in the corner watching you, or blood might drip from the ceiling or walls. No matter what happens, all you must do is make sure that you stay silent and stand before the mirror quietly.\u201cAfter half an hour, the mission will be auto-completed, provided that you do not open your eyes no matter what happens in that half-hour.\u201dAfter reading the mission introduction, Chen Ge\u2019s heart twinged with fear. \u201cCould there really be a world hidden from normal eyes?\u201dIt was still some time before the allocated 2:04 am. Instead of moving to the bathroom, Chen Ge started doing his research online. Chen Ge did manage to find some extra information on this supposed game, and they were all ghost stories. Some said they were cursed after they played this game, while others mentioned missing friends or family members, convinced that they were pulled into the mirror world.\u201cEvery single one of these sounds so authentic.\u201d The more he read, the more interested Chen Ge became. He was, after all, the operator of a Haunted House; his daily exercise was to come up with new ways to scare people, within a safe environment of course. As he read up on the information to this game, he felt as if a new world was opening before his eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s weirdly exciting to play a scary game in the middle of the night inside a Haunted House!\u201dHe checked the battery level of his phone; he felt like recording this momentous occasion.\u201cLater, I\u2019ll put the whole thing on recording; if it is as scary as these people say, then perhaps I can add a new scenario to the Haunted House!\u201dHe scoured the room for a candle and lighter. When the clock struck 2am, he carried the prepared objects and moved toward the bathroom on the first floor of the Haunted House.The reason he carried out this \u2018game\u2019 at the first floor\u2019s toilet was also a calculated decision on Chen Ge\u2019s part. If anything dangerous did occur during the process, at least he could jump directly out the window to save himself. The Haunted House was eerily quiet at night. A young man who refused to turn on the lights to save electricity entered the cramped and narrow toilet with a flashlight and candle.\u201cA dark and claustrophobic environment is the best at evoking the feeling of fear within a person\u2019s heart. The toilet is usually the place that has the most yin energy within the building. Mirrors and cisterns, these items couldn\u2019t have been more mundane, but these everyday items can often be used to increase psychological pressure. The person behind this game is very clever; they know how to make use of the weakness often found within the human heart, and consequently, they are able to create a scary atmosphere with the simplest of objects and conditions.\u201d Chen Ge found this a perfect opportunity to improve his craft.\u201cReal terror actually doesn\u2019t need expensive set-ups. It only needs to highlight and heighten the sense of anxiety inherent in the human heart.\u201d Chen Ge took a deep breath and put his phone on record. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of effect this game will bring, but if anything happens to me, I hope the person who finds this phone will preserve this video because it is a key, a valuable key to unlocking the many layers of deceit.\u201dThen, Chen Ge placed the phone beside the cistern. He adjusted the angle until the camera could capture his person and the mirror opposite him.\u201cIt\u2019s 2:01 am already, three more minutes.\u201dThe wait for death was scarier than death itself. The silence of the toilet amplified all sorts of noises or echoes in the room. As the seconds ticked by, Chen Ge\u2019s heart started to race.He looked at the time on the phone. When the minute hand pointed at the four, he switched off the flashlight and lit up the candle. Following the instructions, he placed it between the mirror and himself.The dancing flame became the only source of light in the dark. It flickered and twirled between the real world and the mirrored world. It acted perhaps like some kind of guidance light, pointing the way for whatever existed in the mirror.Chen Ge looked at his reflection in the mirror, and he felt strangely weirded out. \u201cHas the game started.\u201dHe lowered his head and closed his eyes before starting to mumble his name softly.\u201cChen Ge, Chen Ge, Chen Ge\u2026\u201dRepetition of one\u2019s name would put a psychological distance between it and oneself. Eventually, even one\u2019s name would sound strange to one\u2019s ears. This theory was similar to how after looking at a particular Chinese character repeatedly, one would end up forgetting how to write it when asked.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTo prevent that psychological effect from befalling himself, every time Chen Ge chanted his name, he would leave a three seconds space. This way, he was also counting down the time.After all, the condition for a successful mission was to keep his eyes closed for half an hour no matter the distraction.Standing in front of a mirror and playing a game that involves only a candle at 2 am inside a Haunted House alone\u2026 If I was not doing this myself, even I wouldn\u2019t believe someone would willingly do something this dumb.\u00a0Chen Ge continued to chant his name as the various random thoughts entered his mind.This game is filled with psychological terror; the most difficult part is not facing those supposed ghosts or legends but stopping your mind from straying and forming scary scenarios to scare yourself. As long as you don\u2019t open your eyes, everything should be fine.However, that was easier said than done, because ten minutes after the game started, something did happen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was like an invisible hand was brushing past his face.The door of the toilet cubicles creaked as they were moved by the wind. The water that had gathered at the corner of the ceiling fell onto the floor, causing the insects to scatter. The sound made Chen Ge feel like they were crawling all over his skin.All sorts of noises were amplified by the general silence, which would have heightened the sense of anxiety in most people, but not Chen Ge, who had been trained to have a strong heart since he was young and had a slightly slower than normal sense of perception.He cleared his mind of thought to focus on counting down the time.About twenty minutes had passed, and for some reason, Chen Ge could sense the temperature of the room dropping like someone had placed several blocks of solid ice around him, causing him to shiver involuntarily.Calm yourself! Don\u2019t overthink it and scare yourself! There\u2019s only ten minutes left; Chen Ge, you can do this!\u00a0There was a curious draft flowing beside his ear like something was circling him. He gripped his hands so tightly that the veins on their backs were protruding, but his body seemed to have petrified into immobile stone.\u201cChen Ge, Chen Ge, Chen Ge\u2026\u201dHe continued to mumble to himself. At only five minutes left, Chen Ge could tell the flickering light of the candle had died off, and there seemed to be another presence in the dark calling his name.Echo? Impossible!\u201cChen Ge\u2026\u201d The voice seemed to be summoning him, and it felt urgent like it had something crucial to tell him.The voice seems to be coming from outside the door, shall I go to take a look?However, very soon, Chen Ge rejected this thought from his mind. The rules were explicit; he was required to stand before the mirror and not do anything else.He continued the count-down in his heart, and the voice beside his ear started to warp. He was now certain that there was someone else calling his name, and that person was standing outside the toilet door.The person sounds so urgent, but I\u2019m the one playing this game, so why do they sound so damn hurried? This is obvious a trap, such a cheater.\u00a0Chen Ge turned his lips down with disapproval.\u00a0The set-up and atmosphere are not bad, but alas, the scare tactic is too straightforward and simple.During the final three minutes, there was a shrill noise coming from the toilet door like someone was scratching their nails against it or gnawing their teeth on it. The door creaked subtly like it was about to open at any moment.1,798 seconds, 1,799 seconds, 1,800 seconds!\u00a0The half an hour limit was up; all the noises disappeared at once, and silence reigned once more.To prevent miscalculation, Chen Ge did not open his eyes immediately. He counted for an extra three hundred before he took a step back, placed both his hands over his chest, and fluttered his eyes open.The candle in the toilet had been extinguished, and the place was dark. For some reason, Chen Ge felt like something had shifted. He turned on the flashlight, and when light appeared once more in the cramped area, he was stunned.The mirror before him was filled with cracks, and several images of himself stared back at him. It looked extremely hallucinogenic, but the thing that gave him a bigger scare was the appearance of a broken doll in front of the mirror!The eyes that were made from buttons were shining, and the patchwork body was filled with cotton. The doll was not by any means new, but it held a special meaning for Chen Ge; it was his very first creation and something left at the scene of his parents\u2019 disappearance.The doll was leaning against the mirror like it was trying to stop the thing in the mirror from coming out.\u201cWait, but the toilet door was already locked, how did you come in? Through the window? No wait, the bigger issue is how you moved on your own!\u201d Chen Ge felt like his world was falling apart; he needed some time to process the situation. The man and the doll were locked in this stare for about three minutes before Chen Ge felt more like himself again. He moved his cold fingers and slowly moved toward the doll.For some reason, it felt like the button eyes of the doll seemed to be following him. Chen Ge\u2019s lips twitched involuntarily as he looked at this doll of his. He gave the doll a wide berth to pick the phone next to it. \u201cThankfully, I was clever enough to prepare for this.\u201dThe phone had finished recording. Chen Ge made a second copy before starting to look through the video.The video quality was not that great. The single candle fire danced in the darkness, and while the Chen Ge in front of the mirror looked rather cautious, the Chen Ge in the mirror seemed weirdly at ease.The first ten minutes were fine, but things started to turn weird at the eleven-minute mark.The sound of the wind wasn\u2019t captured by the phone, but one could see the cubicle door moving in the video.Then the video was interrupted by white noise. It was a video that was at most a bit curious, but for some reason, it was weirdly scary. Perhaps this was humanity\u2019s inherent fear of darkness and the unknown.As the video continued to play, Chen Ge\u2019s face turned increasingly pale. He remembered clearly that he had not moved when his eyes were closed, but on the video, he saw his body slowly leaning forward like he was trying to lean into the mirror.At the twenty-five-minute mark, his upper body was already at a seventy-degree angle, and the tip of his nose almost touching the surface of the mirror.Several seconds later, without any warning, spidery cracks started to form on the mirror. It caused even Chen Ge\u2019s heart to skip a beat. Then, the most unbelievable thing happened. The Chen Ge in the mirror\u2019s expression changed. He grinned wickedly as he slammed crazily against the mirror!Right at that minute, the candle went out and the video ended.Due to the camera angle, the video did not show any scene relating to the doll, and Chen Ge himself had no idea what really went down in that last five minutes.\u201cFrom the looks of things, the thing in the mirror wanted to get out, but it was stopped by this doll? In that case, the doll saved me?\u201d Chen Ge picked the doll up from the counter and asked in a serious tone, \u201cCan you understand me? Do you know what happened to my parents?\u201dNaturally, the doll did not answer, but its button eyes seemed to glow in the dark.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe cradled the doll in his arms and turned to look at the toilet door. Afraid of going out, he shrunk underneath one of the windows and pulled out his phone. The mission success message was waiting for him.\u201cIt has to be said that you\u2019re incredibly lucky. Congratulations for completing the Nightmare Mission! Obtained Mission Reward\u2014Elementary Skill: Mortician\u2019s Make-up.\u201cMortician\u2019s Make-up: I hope you will treat this talent with the respect it deserves. Unlike beauty make-up, a mortician only deals with the make-up of the dead. Your hands breathe life into death visages, bringing them everlasting beauty.\u201cFirst Nightmare Mission completed, unlocked the title: Newcomer at Nightmare Town. Obtained additional reward: Unlocked the Trial Mission for the 1 Star scenario, Murder by Midnight! Completion of this Trial Mission will add this scenario to your Haunted House!\u201dLooking at the messages on screen, Chen Ge thought to himself, the success of a Haunted House had plenty to do with a good make-up artist. Be it actors or props, they needed a make-up artist to make them come to life, a good make-up artist can easily create authentic effect to add to the overall scare factor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Looks like the reward for Nightmare Mission is different in the sense that the reward is directly beneficial to myself!\u201dMaking a mental note of this important point, Chen Ge\u2019s heart burned with anticipation. He had seen the existence of the other world, the world of terror, fear, darkness, and danger. Perhaps that world was where his parents had gone, but based on his current power, keeping himself safe was a big enough issue, let alone looking for them. Thankfully, with the black phone by his side, there was still a chance.\u201cIn any case, that is still quite far in the future. The thing I need to focus on is to stabilize the Haunted House business and survive this imminent financial crisis.\u201d He pulled out his phone. \u201cThat was close; something disastrous could have happened. This shows that Nightmare Missions aren\u2019t so easily completed. Then again, there\u2019s no reason for me to go about this alone; in an information age like ours, help can be reached at the tip of one\u2019s fingers.\u201dHe logged into a few famous national supernatural forums and uploaded the original video.A few seconds later, his video was dubbed, \u2018Who is that in the mirror?\u2019It was rapidly viewed and shared. Perhaps people were so bored of the usual host of gossip and news that they wanted to switch it up. The popularity of the video shot up like an arrow; every time Chen Ge refreshed the page, there would be at least ten new comments.\u201c25:14. You all can thank me later.\u201d\u201cHas the uploader lost his mind? Who would do something like this in the middle of the night?\u201d\u201cWhy did the cracks appear on the mirror on their own? Also, what was that thing that knocked into the mirror near the end there\u203d\u201d\u201cThe cracks are mostly caused by temperature manipulation inside the room.\u201d\u201cNo, you guys are all wrong, in Daoism, mirrors are items of pure yin energy. I suggest the video\u2019s title be changed from \u2018Who is that in the mirror?\u2019 to \u2018The Ghost in the mirror!\u2019\u201d\u201cJesus Christ, who dares do something this crazy so late at night\u203d I\u2019m impressed by the uploader\u2019s bravery.\u201d\u201cThis video has definitely been tampered with; if not, take down my ID, I\u2019ll stand on my hand and eat shit!\u201d\u201cAm I the only one who noticed this? The profile of the uploader is the owner of a Haunted House in Western Jiujiang. Don\u2019t get all wrapped up over this; this is nothing more than a fabricated advertisement.\u201dChen Ge\u2019s inbox instantly filled with private messages. Some came with questions, others with suspicion, but Chen Ge ignored them all. He knew his video was real; he didn\u2019t think he owed any of these people any explanation. Those in the know would realize its authenticity, and as for those who just wanted to undermine him, why should he waste his time on them?Looking at the video\u2019s meteoric rise in popularity, Chen Ge realized with a start that this was actually not a bad opportunity. He spliced the original video, only taking the last 14 seconds, and uploaded it to the nation\u2019s biggest video-sharing app.Amid the videos that showcased food, dances, or singing, his haunted video was definitely one of a kind!In just less than ten seconds, people had started to fall for his trap. Unlike the users on supernatural forums who went searching for stuff like this, these random users started leaving inflammatory comments under the video from being scared for no reason.Sadly, on the internet, conflict and controversy bring in more viewers than praise does, so the wave of online censure only brought in more viewers. Scrolling through the comments, Chen Ge could practically sense the hatred and anger directed his way. He shrugged it off with a laugh.To be fair, he did understand why these people reacted the way they did. Most of them were probably preparing for bed, all wrapped up in their blankets, and were probably just looking through some light-hearted videos in preparation to settle down for the night. This scary video of a man wreathed in candlelight had the complete opposite effect than what they were hoping for.The \u201cbest\u201d feature of the video was that it was only 14 seconds, so before they realized what was happening, the scare had already happened. The mirror shattered, and the thing appeared like it was trying to rush out of the mirror and then through the phone screen itself!This was truly a masterful set-up!Based on how lively the comment section is, the popularity of this video looks like it\u2019s not going to drop any time soon\u2026 This means that everyone likes my video, yes?\u00a0A certain someone asked a shameless and rhetorical question.\u00a0The number of followers has already increased by a hundred. If I don\u2019t make use of this opportunity to advertise the Haunted House, then I\u2019ll feel I\u2019ve disappointed all of my new fans and followers!Chen Ge edited the title of the video and attached the address of the Haunted House at the user info section. He even added in brackets: A Completely\u00a0Not\u00a0-Scary Haunted House.Chen Ge was satisfied with his updated user page. He remained seated under the window to look through the stream of messages and eventually fell asleep.\u2026Chen Ge was woken up by the sunlight that fell on his face. He stretched his tired body and stood up from the corner of the toilet.\u201cIt\u2019s 8.30 am already\u203d\u201d He dusted his clothes and pocketed both the doll and the phone before leaving the toilet.He noticed there were obvious scratch marks on the edges of the wooden toilet door, like it had been munched on by rodents.\u201cJust what was the thing outside the door last night?\u201d Looking at this, Chen Ge suddenly felt thankful he did not move from the mirror last night and go out to take a look.\u201cNightmare Missions might cause unexpected circumstances. I need to be more careful in the future.\u201d Since there was not any discernible change to the Haunted House, Chen Ge shrugged it off and prepared to welcome a new day.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe New Century Park opened at 9 am. At 8.45 am, a slender and lithe figure that was disproportionate to her chest size ran toward him carrying a backpack.\u201cBoss!\u201d The girl radiated an aura of youthfulness. Her exquisite features practically glowed in the sun. Her skin was taut and supple like fresh apricot that one could not help but wish to take a bite of.\u201cXiao Wan, your timing is perfect. I\u2019ve just added a new background track to our song database. Listen to it and tell me what you think.\u201d Before Chen Ge could finish his sentence, Xu Wan gripped his hand tightly. On reflex, he asked, \u201cWhat are you doing\u203d\u201d\u201cI just saw a big crowd gathered at the entrance of the park! They\u2019re discussing the Haunted House! We have people coming here just to experience the Haunted House!\u201d Xu Wan exclaimed excitedly. \u201cBoss, we seem to have plenty of customers waiting!\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t that be expected? Is this your first time at the park?\u201d Chen Ge pretended to be unaffected. He pulled out his phone to look at the video sharing app. His current number of followers had broken through five hundred, and the popularity of his video had reached the top ten of the app. He scanned through the comments, and unlike other comment sections which were filled with XOXO or \u2018<3\u2019s, his was filled with endless reprimands, rebukes, and threats. Some of them even said that they had prepared the knife to slay Chen Ge and that they were on the way to his address.\u201cEr, this seems to have gotten slightly out of hand.\u201d Chen Ge coughed awkwardly before dragging Xu Wan with him into the Haunted House. \u201cWe have fifteen more minutes to the official opening time of the park. Since we\u2019re the only two left protecting this Haunted House, be prepared for the imminent war!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Lonelytree\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Millman97Chen Ge\u2019s Haunted House currently only had two available scenarios, Night of the Living Dead and Minghun.The Night of the Living Dead was heavily criticized by the black phone. Chen Ge thought about it as objectively as he could, and he had to admit there were many flaws with that scenario. Furthermore, to complete the scenario, he had to have at least three workers.\u201cXiao Wan, our main theme today will be Minghun. Later, after I\u2019m done setting up the background music, remember to put on your earphones when you work. Also, I\u2019ll be doing your make-up today.\u201d\u201cBoss, you know how to do make-up?\u201d Xiao Wan laughed half-mockingly at him. \u201cFine, but I\u2019ll do it myself if you screw it up.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make you look so beautiful that you\u2019ll take their breath away.\u201dThey walked into the make-up room. Chen Ge set Xiao Wan down before the mirror and used the ball of his palm to slowly massage her face.\u201cActivating elementary skill\u2014Mortician\u2019s Make-up.\u201dLooking at the youthful girl in the mirror, many memories that Chen Ge felt did not belong to him suddenly appeared in his mind. It was a chaotic mess. There was not only knowledge about color-matching and other make-up skills but also human anatomy, physiology, bone structure, and the study of death.\u201cBoss, are you sure you know how to do make-up?\u201d Thirty seconds had passed. Xu Wan sat before the mirror, feeling the unfamiliar temperature of the hand on her face. Looking at the reflection of her face, which her boss was fussing over, her heart started to race, and she felt weirdly shy for some reason.\u201cA good make-up artist will come up with different styles according to the face shape of his client. And Xiao Wan, I have to say, you have a pretty good base already.\u201d There were literally no dirty thoughts on Chen Ge\u2019s mind. After he activated the Mortician\u2019s Make-up skill, Xu Wan had already become a \u2018corpse\u2019 in his mind.\u201cHammer, shaver, scalpel, needle and thread, formaldehyde, alcohol\u2026 sigh, I\u2019m missing all these things. Looks like I\u2019ll have to settle with the most basic make-up,\u201d Chen Ge mumbled to himself, scaring Xu Wan quite a bit. The girl could not understand why her boss would require so many scary instruments for a simple Haunted House make-up. She was feeling slightly spooked, but since she did not feel like it was appropriate to say no to her boss, all she could was glance at the progress through her half-shut eyes and pray for the best possible outcome.\u201cThe foundation is too bland, and the blush too bright. Also, where\u2019s the lipstick?\u201d Chen Ge continued to grumble, and he even started to blend colors. The familiarity and expertise of his movements did not match his appearance of a geek who should not have known any of these things.Xu Wan herself was baffled by what was happening before her.\u00a0Color-matching without the aid of online guides or books, this is some high-level make-up skill!\u201cBoss, I don\u2019t think you should be so hard on yourself. After all, the lighting in the Haunted House is so dim; the visitors wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything.\u201d\u201cShush and stop moving,\u201d Chen Ge cut her off and helped her apply the eye-shadow that he had just blended. It was just several strokes of eyeshadow, but it contributed a drastic change to Xu Wan\u2019s personality; it added an air of mystery and frostiness to her.Xu Wan\u2019s natural instinct was to mock her boss, but when she saw her reflection in the mirror, her tiny mouth fell open.\u201cA blush of just Cherry Red will be too simple, lacks layering, but when combined with some of this purple, it\u2019ll be so different. They blend perfectly like they\u2019re meant for each other,\u201d Chen Ge explained like a make-up guru as he used the brush to blend the two blushes on the back of his palm.\u201cBoss, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cOur Haunted House\u2019s blush is too gaudy in the hopes of creating a striking visual effect, but that\u2019s pushing it a bit too far, so I\u2019m toning it down by first applying and spreading it on my hand.\u201d Chen Ge\u2019s action was gentle, and minutes later, the blush did become smoother to the eyes, and there was even a brightening effect to it.Now, Xu Wan\u2019s mouth formed a perfect O. \u201cBoss, you\u2019re amazing! Where did you learn all this?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s plenty more of my talent you haven\u2019t seen yet; make-up and beauty tricks are just things I explore in my free time,\u201d Chen Ge explained with a smile. He was in quite a great mood because he now had actual proof that the phone app really could affect the real world.In just ten minutes, Chen Ge finished Xu Wan\u2019s make-up. \u201cNow, take a look, what do you think?\u201dThe person in the mirror seemed to have walked out of a water painting. She was a quintessential eastern beauty, but there was simply something off about her.Xu Wan could not help but stand up and twirl in front of the mirror. Her expression changed from utter shock to fascination before ending with a shudder.\u201cBoss, I\u2019ve never looked so beautiful in my life, is this person really me?\u201d\u201cOf course, it is.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d She reached out hesitantly toward the mirror. \u201cHow come it feels like I\u2019m looking at a dead person?\u201dXu Wan\u2019s observation also made Chen Ge suck in a cold breath. The purpose of a mortician\u2019s make-up was bringing out the beauty of the dead, so naturally Chen Ge\u2019s make-up was not meant for the living.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, the amusement park is opening soon, so quickly go change into your clothes and stand by at the second floor Minghun scenario. Remember to put on your Bluetooth earpiece and listen to my direction.\u201d Chen Ge tactfully moved the topic away and shoved Xu Wan off to her work. He used the little remaining time he had left to work on the puppets and mannequins in the Minghun scenario set piece. With the aid of Mortician\u2019s Make-up, all of the mannequins looked creepily alive.\u201cI suppose that\u2019s all for now, I\u2019ll recolor them when I have time.\u201d Chen Ge packed up his toolbox and rushed downstairs. Before he reached the entrance, he could already hear the chatter of the visitors.\u201cYou\u2019re also here to seek revenge from the immoral bastard?\u201d\u201cYes! The creep caused me to drop my phone, and it broke, so what do you think?\u201d\u201cYou people are still lucky. My pants were already on the ground when this thing popped up! I was so scared; the scream left my throat before I could help it. Thinking something happened to me, my parents rushed into my room. So, with not a shred of fabric on me and a roll of toilet paper in my hand, you can imagine how awkward it was\u2026\u201d\u2026Listening to the visitors\u2019 complaints, Chen Ge tried to stop himself from laughing. He took a deep breath and put on a serious countenance before pushing the entrance open.\u201cWelcome to my humble House of Horrors.\u201dChen Ge\u2019s lips curled upward when he saw the long line of customers.\u201cXiao Chen, your place is already packed so early in the morning? Not bad.\u201d The worker who was fixing the carousel gasped with surprise. As he was about to wander over to greet Chen Ge, he realized how curious these visitors were looking. They did not look like the normal happy park goers.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt\u2019s okay; I\u2019m just glad for the support.\u201d Chen Ge shrugged as he pulled the gate open.\u201cWho said we\u2019re here to support you? Shameless!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re here to resolve debts, not to play!\u201d\u201cIs he the real deal? You\u2019re the one who uploaded video last night? Where\u2019s my knife? Hand me my knife!\u201dThe visitors were so \u2018passionate\u2019 that it was total chaos, but Chen Ge spoke over them. \u201cSince you\u2019re already here, why don\u2019t you come in for an experience? The best way to counter fear is to find a more intense stimulation\u2014fight poison with poison so to speak\u2014to desensitize yourself to the fear. Indeed, it is my fault for not giving more warning for yesterday\u2019s video, and for that, I apologize, so how about this? All the tickets into the Haunted House will be fifty percent off today. Don\u2019t miss out on such a wonderful discount!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No way!\u201dAfter several minutes of arguing, there were still no visitors who showed any intention of entering the Haunted House. They stayed firmly outside the gate as if the entrance was a line of minefields. They were so terrified that even Chen Ge could not help but sigh. \u201cNo one dares to come in just to give it a try? My Haunted House is not even scary; if you don\u2019t believe me, feel free to check the online reviews.\u201dAs he said so, some in the crowd really did do that.\u201cIndeed, all the reviews say the place is not scary.\u201d\u201cThe only good thing about it is apparently they hire a pretty lady to play the ghost.\u201d\u201cThen, shall we give it a try?\u201dYet another long wait later, finally someone stepped forward. \u201cBunch of cowards, this is just a Haunted House, how scary can it be? I\u2019ve seen plenty of human carcasses; do you think I\u2019ll be afraid of this?\u201dThe person who stepped forth was a bushy-browed young man with a crew cut. He looked rather unassuming.\u201cBro, stop joking with us. Even bluffing has a limit to it.\u201d\u201cJust how old are you? Yet you want us to believe you\u2019ve seen real human carcasses?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re all scaredy-cats here, so why are you lying to us?\u201dJust as the voices of derision gathered, a rather soft but firm voice cut through the cacophony. \u201cHe\u2019s not lying. Facing human carcasses is indeed a daily business for people like us.\u201dThe crowd turned toward the voice, and they saw a tall, slender woman in a sun hat and a white dress walking over from the park entrance. Her facial expression was cold, and it was as if she carried a personal air-conditioner with her because the temperature around her felt rather low.\u201cSenior!\u201d The young man bounced like a rabbit toward the woman, attempting to help her with her bag, but he was deterred by a wintry glare from the woman. He stood where he was, all flustered with an awkward yet polite smile on his face.\u201cWait, did you just call her senior? You two are still students?\u201d Chen Ge\u2019s attention was also drawn to these two young people.\u201cWe\u2019re Forensic Science students from Jiujiang Medical University. My name is He San, and this is my senior, Gao Ru Xue.\u201d The young man smiled at Chen Ge. \u201cThe video you uploaded last night has been shared on our school\u2019s forum, and my senior decided to pay this place a visit after watching it.\u201d\u201cThat unapproachable beauty is a forensic doctor?\u201d\u201cAlthough, her presence does match her profession nicely.\u201d\u201cMiss, how about we be friends\u2026\u201dThe male visitors started to crowd around the woman. Acting as her guardian, He San merely smiled and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you all understand what you\u2019re getting into. The other morning, my senior cut open some toads or rats, but right after washing her hands, she happily sauntered over to the canteen to have braised meat completely unaffected; when she passed the lab late last night and saw the bodies soaked in formaldehyde, she yawned and greeted them nicely. Listen to my advice and measure yourself. The number of men she has operated on is probably higher than the number of girls any one of you have held the hand of.\u201dThis unique introduction had achieved the result he wanted; instantly, a two-meter radius emptied around the woman.Chen Ge also felt a mounting headache upon hearing the young man\u2019s introduction. It was not easy for him to finally finish the Nightmare Mission and receive the reward, but the first challenger his updated Haunted House received was a pair of forensic science students. Since their degree was in forensic science, naturally, they would have a fear threshold higher than most!\u201cCan we go in now?\u201d The woman strode impatiently to stand before Chen Ge. She was already tall, but in her heels, she was practically on the same level as Chen Ge.\u201cThe original ticket price is twenty, so with the fifty percent discount, it\u2019ll be ten. Before we go in, I would like to provide the Haunted House\u2019s background and a warning.\u201d Chen Ge remembered the tips provided by the black phone. One of the three important features of a Haunted House was its plot and background. It would help the visitors get into the mood.\u201cFirst, an introduction. Even though many online reviews say my Haunted House is not scary, as a responsible proprietor, I wish to divulge to both of you some facts. The ground we\u2019re on was the largest mass grave in Jiujiang city fifty years ago. Thirty years ago, due to city planning, they flattened the graves and built the Jiujiang City Hospital on the site. What happened next you can easily find out on the internet. The hospital was forced to close down due to the frequent occurrence of many incidents that could not be explained, and my Haunted House is a remodeled hospital building that was behind. It still hides many secrets that concern the ill-fated hospital.\u201dAfter that, Chen Ge pointed at the warning sign beside the main entrance. \u201cNo entry to visitors with a heart condition or vascular disease. Visitors above twelve and below sixteen have to be accompanied at all times by their parents or guardians. If there are no questions, please follow me.\u201dChen Ge pulled open the black heavy drapes, closed the rusted gate, and led He San as well as Gao Ru Xue down the dark corridor.\u201cSince they cannot share the same room in life, they\u2019ll share the same grave in death. This is a local urban legend that has been passed down for many generations.\u201cPing Jianghou wished to set up a Minghun for her son who unfortunately passed away too soon. Therefore, she invited a fortune teller to take a look at her son\u2019s life and fortune map before finally pinpointing a girl as the perfect candidate to accompany his son in death.\u201cHowever, the girl already had someone else in her heart. To make her submit, Ping Jianghou killed her lover by shoving him into a lake and threatened the girl\u2019s parents\u2019 lives.\u201cFinally, to protect her parents, the girl agreed to marry a dead man.\u201cRed and white candles stood side by side, a wedding coupled with a death. After the girl was sealed in the coffin and buried alive, many weird things started to happen to the Ping household.\u201cThe statues of bronze chicks started to bleed, and the paper dolls burned for the dead were found blinking. And every midnight, a woman could be seen wandering the halls.\u201cThe scenario that you\u2019ll be experiencing this time is called Minghun. The set is completely open; you can go anywhere you wish, but you need to locate the correct exit in less than fifteen minutes. If you wish to surrender, stand under any of the available cameras and scream for help; I\u2019ll fetch you.\u201d Chen Ge stopped at the second-floor entrance and bowed. \u201cEnjoy.\u201d\u201cThat sounds interesting, but if you think that\u2019s enough to scare me, you\u2019re sorely mistaken,\u201d He San rambled shamelessly while he hid behind his senior. His lips said he was not afraid, but his feet seemed screw shut to the ground, unwilling to move.In comparison, Gao Ru Xue was more collected. She entered the scenario wordlessly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSenior, wait for me!\u201dAfter the two visitors entered, Chen Ge locked the front door entrance and called Xu Wan. \u201cXiao Wan, our guests have entered, be prepared. Also remember to put your earpieces in.\u201dAfter giving all the necessary orders, Chen Ge returned to the main control room. This small room was where he could see the different cameras and where he could control all of the set-ups.\u201cI really didn\u2019t think I will be using this music so soon since it does sound a bit dark, but since they\u2019re not normal visitors, I have no choice!\u201d Chen Ge turned on the audio system and put the Black Friday music on repeat.With everything in place, he sat before the monitor watching He San and Gao Ru Xue closely. If anything weird happened to them, he would rush in to save them immediately.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This is an almost perfect reconstruction of a traditional\u00a0Siheyuan\u00a01\u00a0. There are three layers of entrance:\u00a0\u00a0Dao Zuo Wu\u00a02\u00a0, the Main House, the\u00a0Ear Houses\u00a03\u00a0,\u00a0Chao Shou Corridor\u00a04\u00a0,\u00a0Chui Hua Men\u00a05\u00a0, East and West Houses, the Back House,\u00a0Ru Yi Door\u00a06\u00a0, and so on. I\u2019m impressed by the attention to detail; it really does feel like you\u2019ve travelled back in time.\u201d Gao Ru Xue walked through the set pieces, stopping occasionally to study the details.\u201cSenior, we\u2019re inside a Haunted House, not on a study trip, do you mind?\u201d Their footsteps echoed through the empty courtyard in which paper money was fluttering. It was as if He San was in a different dimension compared to Gao Ru Xue. He turned back every few seconds, afraid that something might jump out at him from the dark corners. \u201cWe\u2019d better find the exit as soon as possible; this place makes me jumpy.\u201d\u201cSince we\u2019re already here, of course, we have to savor the experience. Remember, we\u2019re customers, don\u2019t let the Haunted House toy with you.\u201d\u201cBut don\u2019t you remember the boss warned that we have to find the exit in less than fifteen minutes? Based on the evil look of that guy, I\u2019m sure he has something scary planned if we are unable to escape in fifteen minutes!\u201d He San tried to urge Gao Ru Xue, but the latter was not at all affected.\u201cThere are only so many tactics that a Haunted House can employ. At worst, they\u2019ll have the workers dress up as ghosts to chase us around. Xiao San, you deal with dead bodies every day, don\u2019t tell me that you\u2019ve suddenly decided to be afraid of ghosts?\u201d As Gao Ru Xue wandered down the Hugging Corridor, she pushed open the door to the Left Ear House.The set piece of Minghun was typical of an old Beijing Siheyuan. The Main House was the living building for the elderlies and the head of the house; the East and West Houses were for the sons and daughters, while the Ear Houses were for the servants and maids.As the door was pushed open, the tables and chairs in the room tumbled over. The pillows on the bed were shredded, causing cotton fluff to float up into the air. A white hanging cloth swayed right in the middle of room.\u201cSenior, I\u2019ll guard the door, be careful inside\u2026\u201d Before He San could finish, he was dragged into the room by Gao Ru Xue. His body froze, and his face blanched watching the white cloth sway in the windless room.\u201cInteresting, the cloth is at least 1.5 meters off the ground; this height is not enough to cause strangulation from hanging. The tumbled chairs and tables, as well as the signs of struggle on the floor\u2026 the Haunted House is trying to create the illusion that this was a forced suicide. But the Ear Houses were meant for the maids. This means that the specter refused to spare even those who are unrelated to her death. She\u2019s hell-bent on torturing those in this house to their death.\u201d Behind Gao Ru Xue\u2019s clear analysis, there was a hint of excitement. \u201cThe design of this Haunted House is quite impressive; there might still be other hidden secrets that we haven\u2019t discovered yet.\u201dShe walked around the room and yanked off the faded bed cover. Lying underneath it was a paper doll.\u201cA paper doll lying in a living person\u2019s bed?\u201d Gao Ru Xue tossed the doll to the side and bent down to flip the mattress over. There was nothing underneath.\u201cThe greater the anticipation, the greater the disappointment\u2026 looks like I\u2019ve overestimated this Haunted House. Let\u2019s go, the exit is not in this room.\u201d She shrugged before walking out. He San, who had been left alone in the living room, had his teeth chattering. Perhaps it was the angle, but he swore he saw the paper doll, which was lying on the floor, wink at him.\u201cThe statues of bronze chicks started to bleed, and the paper dolls burned for the dead were found blinking\u2026 Senior, wait for me!\u201dAs the door to the Ear House closed, the white cloth in the room stopped swaying.\u201cCan you be a little quieter, why are you screaming left and right? Stop acting like such a little girl, man up!\u201d Gao Ru Xue rolled her eyes at He San as she waited for him to catch up.\u201cI\u2019m not scared, but this place seriously makes me feel uncomfortable, and the longer we stay here, the stronger that feeling becomes. Don\u2019t you feel like something is amplifying our deepest fear?\u201dHe San\u2019s words hit the nail on the head. Gao Ru Xue thought about it, and she also realized that something was off. The most important quality of a forensic doctor was the ability to stay calm no matter the situation, but when she was scolding He San earlier, her composure was shattered; this hadn\u2019t happened to her before.\u201cCould it be that I too am feeling afraid? But why should I be afraid? Everything here is obviously fake!\u201d A crack started to form on Gao Ru Xue\u2019s internal defense. Neither of them could figure out the source of their fear. With the combined effect of suspicion and psychological terror, the seed of fear had started to grow in their hearts.\u201cSay, do you think there is really something or someone inhabiting this place? After all, the boss did say this place is built on top of a mass grave and is a remodeled abandoned hospital\u2026\u201d\u201cShush! Our university\u2019s morgue is even scarier than this! You\u2019re a forensic doctor; how is it that you\u2019re so easily scared\u203d\u201d Even though Gao Ru Xue said that she was not afraid, it was noticeable that the speed of her speech had increased. She looked around her. The old house, the mourning hall, dead trees, the paper money, they were all set pieces; they weren\u2019t scary. \u201cSo, what is it that I\u2019m afraid of?\u201dThe two were so distracted by their environment that they did not notice the background music that was on repeat. This banned song called Black Friday had slowly but surely snuck its way into their hearts, evoking their sense of fear.\u201cXiao San, how long have we been in here already?\u201d\u201cI have no idea, but I have a feeling we won\u2019t be able to escape in fifteen minutes!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t fret, give me some time to think about this,\u201d Gao Ru Xue said as she wandered down the corridor. \u201cThis Haunted House is not that scary; it\u2019s because the boss has been giving us negative psychological suggestions. Ever since we entered the Haunted House, he has been stressing points like, mass grave, live burial, ghosts, and stuff. That is a classic method to weaken our hearts. However, the most cunning part of this man is, even though he has set up a time limit, he did not say what will happen if we fail. This creates a natural pressure on ourselves, causing our minds to fill in the blank with the scariest speculation.\u201d\u201cThen, what do you think we should do now? This Haunted House feels a bit different from others.\u201d He San was an honest boy; he would do what his senior ask him to do.\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong there; a normal Haunted House hires actors to dress up as ghosts or uses plenty of set-ups to paint gory scenes to scare us, but this Haunted House doesn\u2019t do that. He has prepared the set beforehand and allows us to wander about it freely. Without guidance and a set plot, there\u2019s no telling what will happen.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI understand what you mean; the scariest is the unknown.\u201d He San nodded.\u201cThat explanation is as good as any.\u201d Gao Ru Xue frowned imperceptibly. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s move on to the next room.\u201dThe Ear House was attached to the Main House. After pushing open the wooden door, it revealed a room filled with mourning outfits and a painted coffin sitting right in the middle of the room.The red coffin had a big \u201c\u559c\u201d character, cut out from white paper pasted in the middle of it. Standing in two neat rows beside it were plenty of paper mannequins.Each of them had a name written on their back, and they all wore thin make-up on their faces. Their eyes seemed to glow as the door was pushed open, and they appeared to be quietly staring at the two figures standing at the door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Something must be wrong with them! Could it be that they\u2019re all living people playing dress-up\u203d F*ck, I have a feeling they\u2019re all going to move soon enough!\u201dThe paper mannequins that had been touched up by Chen Ge using Mortician\u2019s Make-up had something weird about them. They were obviously inanimate objects, but there was a certain liveliness to them.Gao Ru Xue glared angrily at He San. She thought to herself,\u00a0Why did I bring him with me today\u203d Fear is contagious; I was not so afraid to begin with, but because of him, even I feel slightly affected.\u201cDo you mind keeping your opinions to yourself? If you give anymore useless observations like that, I\u2019m just going to leave you here.\u201dShe was the first to step into the room to take a cursory look around. The windows in the Main House were just decorative; they did not lead outside.\u201cSenior, let\u2019s go. This building is heavy with Yin energy, and the place is sealed. The exit is definitely not here.\u201d\u201cThe owner of this Haunted House is a master manipulator who knows how human psychology works, so we have to act the complete opposite of how a normal people would. A place like this that does not seem to harbor the exit is exactly where we need to examine closer.\u201d Gao Ru Xue walked around the room, sending up wafts of air that caused some of the paper mannequins that had toppled to the floor to scrape unnaturally.He San\u2019s heart was at his throat, still standing outside the door. \u201cBut there\u2019s no hiding place in this room; you can see every surface. Where can the exit possibly be hidden?\u201d\u201cNo hiding place? Who told you that?\u201d Gao Ru Xue stopped at the middle of the room, raised her fair leg to step on the red coffin. \u201cCome help me, we\u2019re opening this coffin!\u201d\u201cOpen that thing\u203d\u201d He San\u2019s white lips were quivering. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a bit too disrespectful?\u201d\u201cYou plan to spend the rest of your life in this Haunted House?\u201d Under constant urging from Gao Ru Xue, He San moved inch by inch deeper into the room. He made sure to stay far away from the paper mannequins. He bent over to grab one side of the coffin\u2019s lid.\u201cOn the count of three, pull!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cOne, two\u2026\u201d\u201cDong!\u201d Gao Ru Xue was only half way through the countdown when there was a loud noise in the room.\u201cWhat was that?\u201d He San\u2019s soul practically jumped out of his skin.\u201cShush!\u201d Gao Ru Xue put her finger to her lips to have him quiet down. She looked around before her gaze eventually fell on the red coffin before her. \u201cThe sound seems to have come from inside the coffin.\u201dWhen she said so, color drained from He San\u2019s face. His Adam\u2019s apple trembled unevenly, and his hands, which were holding the coffin lid, were shaking like he was holding a hot iron brand. \u201cSenior, I beg of you, there\u2019s nothing here, can we go now?\u201d\u201cCalm down, the sound only occurred when we planned to open the lid, don\u2019t you think that\u2019s very strange?\u201d\u201cSenior, the coffin just made a sound; that\u2019s a hell of a lot more than strange!\u201d He San\u2019s fear was greatly amplified by Black Friday; at that moment, he just wanted to leave as soon as possible.\u201cThink about it, there are only two reason that a coffin could make a sound. One, there\u2019s a worker hiding in it waiting to scare us when we open the coffin. Two, there\u2019s a hidden machine set-up inside it and activating it will cause some changes to this Minghun scenario. So, no matter which possibility it is, this coffin is crucial to this scenario. If we wish to escape, we have to open this coffin.\u201d Gao Ru Xue slapped the lid twice, adding, \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate, just pull it open.\u201d\u201cEven though I have no idea what you just said, it did sound quite logical.\u201dHe San and Gao Ru Xue applied their strength at the same time, and the heavy coffin lid started to slide. When the coffin was a quarter of the way open, the ancient-looking coffin suddenly exploded with a loud bang without warning.Innumerable paper mannequins and paper money shot out from within the coffin, and a strange woman\u2019s laugh filled the room. At that moment, the Main House door started to close on its own!\u201cLet\u2019s go before it\u2019s too late!\u201d He San did not hesitate. He was close to the entrance, and in his hurry to escape, he had forgotten completely about his senior. He dashed to the door in several steps, but before he could jump through the door, the face of a woman flew in front of him!It was a death visage that was pale, exquisite, and breathtakingly beautiful!\u201cF*ck!\u201d He San\u2019s first reaction was to raise his arm to punch at the face. However, the owner of said face seemed to have predicted his reaction because it easily swiveled away from his assault.\u201cGhost! Help!\u201d He San collapsed to the floor and half-crawled, half-ran in a random direction.\u201cHe San! Don\u2019t sprint around aimlessly!\u201d Gao Ru Xue yelled at the top of her lungs when she saw a red shadow follow He San into the building he chose to hide in.\u201cThe side houses are for the sons and daughters. This is bad; the place He San has gone into was the living area for the specter before she died!\u201d Gao Ru Xue rushed outward, but she realized the door had locked. She banged on the wooden door cursing, \u201cDivide and conquer? Isn\u2019t this just a Haunted House attraction? Is it really necessary to do such a sick thing\u203d\u201dThe coffin had broken in pieces, and the paper mannequins littered the floor. Gao Ru Xue, who was trapped, had completely lost her collected composure. She punched and kicked at the door and finally got it to open one minute later.However, in that one minute, everything outside the Main House seemed to have changed.\u201cXiao San? He San!\u201d Gao Ru Xue shouted twice, but there was no answer. Other than the eerie background music, there was only the shuffling sound of paper money brushing against each other as her reply.What\u2019s going on? The Haunted House is only so big, so it is impossible for He San not to have heard me, or did some accident befall him?\u00a0For a reason Gao Ru Xue couldn\u2019t explain, an image of a crime scene flashed across her mind. She trailed down the corridor and found her way to the West House by tracing her memory.Xiao San ran in this direction earlier.As the old wooden door creaked open, the celebratory calligraphy written on white paper fluttered to the ground. Gao Ru Xue stepped into the room. The room was decorated as a newlywed room, but instead of red, the color of celebration, all the decorations were white, the Chinese funereal color. It was creepy to say the least.Where has he run off to?\u00a0The atmosphere in the room was off. The only light source was the white lantern hanging outside the door. Gao Ru Xue stepped slowly forward as cold drafts blew in from behind her. Her exposed skin was chilled like there were small invisible hands in the air caressing her skin.The paper money crunched under her feet, and occasionally, she would kick something hard that she could not tell the identity of because it was too dark. She gritted her teeth and powered on.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGao Ru Xue pulled the drapes in the room open to let some of the light in. The place was empty other than a bed that was covered underneath a mosquito net as well as a set of bronze mirrors that sat facing each other next to the wall.I saw He San run into this room with my own two eyes. Only one or two minutes have passed since then, so he could not have disappeared so soon? Unless\u2026 the exit is in this room and He San accidentally stumbled across it?Gao Ru Xue took a deep breath before deciding to perform a closer examination of the room. However, as she took the first step, she heard a second set of footsteps falling closely behind hers.\u201cWho\u2019s behind me?\u201dShe whipped around, but she only saw a bronze mirror and her reflection in the mirror itself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Lonelytree\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Millman97Phew, scared myself for no reason.\u00a0Gao Ru Xue\u2019s chest rose unevenly as her heart beat at an impossible speed. It had been such a long time since she had acted such a fool.The creepy music continued to play. Using the weak light, she could see the pupils of her reflection in the mirror start to shrink. In the mirror, the mosquito net behind her was opening on its own! The face of a paper mannequin showed itself, and from the reflection in the mirror, she could clearly see that it was smiling at her.\u201cWho\u2019s there\u203d\u201d A human being\u2019s normal go-to reaction during extreme fear was anger and aggression. Gao Ru Xue turned around, but there was nothing there. She ran toward the mosquito net to yank it open to take a look at what was really behind it. However, the design of the net was more complicated than she expected; it had many different layers, and the netting was connected to the bed itself. Instead of untangling the net, Gao Ru Xue got herself stuck in the netting instead.Right then, she could hear footsteps coming from inside the room.I\u2019m not moving, so whose footsteps are those?\u00a0The disappearance of her junior combined with the effect of Black Friday had completely shattered Gao Ru Xue\u2019s psychology defense. The sound of the unknown footsteps was the last straw that ultimately broke the camel\u2019s back.Her legs turned to jelly, and she found herself unable to move. Fear was like an uncaged animal, tearing at her sense of rationality. Gao Ru Xue yanked on the netting, trying her best to untangle herself from it, but it was to no avail. The sound of footsteps became suspiciously close.Impossible! The room is only so big, if someone was coming near, I\u2019d definitely be able to see it!\u00a0Her heart was a chaotic mess, to the extent that even the simple decorations inside the room were sending chills down her spine.The white lantern outside the window swayed in the wind, causing the light in the room to dim. Her reflection in the bronze mirror started to blur. Gao Ru Xue\u2019s pupils shook because she realized the reflection in the mirror was no longer herself but a strange woman in a wedding dress!In more ways than one, the woman\u2019s appearance seemed like she was dressed to kill. Her beauty had an ethereal quality to it; it was frighteningly captivating, like looking at a recently unearthed piece of art.Staring at the woman in the mirror, Gao Ru Xue\u2019s lips quivered, and fear appeared on her face for the first time.From her experience dealing with so many autopsies, she was familiar with the feeling the woman in the mirror was giving her; this was the face of a dead person!The Haunted House is hiding a real dead body!\u00a0Just as this thought entered her mind, fear swallowed her like a giant wave. She tried her best to run away from the bronze mirror, and as she staggered back, she knocked into something.At the same time, the sound of footsteps stopped, and Gao Ru Xue\u2019s mind went completely blank in that moment. Having lost the ability to think, she turned instinctively to look behind her.Meeting her gaze was a woman in dead man\u2019s make-up and wedding dress. She smiled at her.\u201d\u00a0Ahh!\u00a0\u201d The piercing scream shattered the quietness of the Haunted House; it could heard even outside the building itself. With her arms still entangled in the netting, Gao Ru Xue\u2019s legs finally gave, and she collapsed to the ground.The suppressed fear manifested as tears, which fell uncontrollably. Her eyes were screwed shut, and her mouth was slightly open. The woman started to dry heave.\u201cXiao Wan, quickly bring her out!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d The female ghost standing before Gao Ru Xue removed her Bluetooth earpieces that were hidden under her hair and squatted down to say, \u201cThe experience ends here. Please catch your breath, I\u2019ll lead you out now.\u201dTen seconds later, the exit to the Minghun scenario was pushed open. Chen Ge rushed over in a hurry and asked, \u201cThere\u2019s only one? Where\u2019s the other one?\u201dHe rushed over in a hurry because he could not locate He San on the surveillance cameras.\u201cThat coward fainted when he ran into the room and saw the two mirrors. I was afraid that he might influence the experience of the next visitor, so I dragged him to hide him under the bed\u2026\u201d\u201cFainted?\u201d Chen Ge also did not know how to respond. \u201cSafety\u2019s first, if this happens again in the future, inform me immediately!\u201d\u201cYes, Boss.\u201d After leaving Xu Wan to look after Gao Ru Xue, Chen Ge went into the room to pull He San out from behind the bed. The young man was completely unconscious like he was greatly traumatized.Sh*t, I have to bring him to somewhere open-air first!\u00a0Chen Ge carried He San and ran toward the entrance of the Haunted House. He peeled back the heavy drapes and kicked the gate open. \u201cClear some space please!\u201dChen Ge placed He San at the entrance of the Haunted House, and he started to massage the young man and place ice packs over his forehead, trying to rouse him. This development had stunned the visitors that still had not left the park.\u201cJesus Christ, what happened in there?\u201d\u201cVisit the Haunted House until he fainted, this is first time I\u2019ve seen something like this.\u201d\u201cHe was scared until he fainted, right? So why would the online reviews say this place is not scary?\u201d\u201cF*ck, I\u2019m starting to have chills\u2026\u201dNot long after that, Xu Wan came out carrying Gao Ru Xue. The woman was a complete contrast from the person who walked in. The new Gao Ru Xue\u2019s hair was a mess, her face was blanched, and her gait was weak. There were still tears drying on her face.\u201cThis is a completely different person!\u201d\u201cWhat did she experience in there?\u201d\u201cBut why should they be afraid? Aren\u2019t they forensic students?\u201dXu Wan placed Gao Ru Xue on the steps and passed her a bottle of water. The woman was still recovering from the experience, as evidenced by her hands that were shaking as she held the bottle.\u201cDon\u2019t crowd around them, they need air!\u201d Chen Ge also felt a headache coming. It was normal for Gao Ru Xue to be shedding frightened tears, but what about this young man? Why would he suddenly faint? Why didn\u2019t he admit that he was easily scared\u203d What was with men and their pride?The commotion caused more and more visitors to gather at the Haunted House. This attracted the attention of the park manager, who rushed over on his electronic bike.\u201cXiao Chen! What is going on here? Why is there a fainted visitor on the ground\u203d\u201d asked Uncle Xu as he jumped down from his bike and pushed through the crowd.\u201cI have no idea; maybe it\u2019s the heat\u2026\u201d Even Chen Ge did not feel convinced by his answer.\u201cA hot flash in this kind of weather?\u201d Uncle Xu rushed over to pick up He San and place him on his bike. \u201cRegardless, we have to send him to the medical room first!\u201dSeveral minutes later, perhaps it was the massage or the noise from the crowds, He San started to rouse. His eyelashes fluttered and sat up from the bike. His eyes were bloodshot, and his mouth kept on mumbling, \u201cMirror, Mirror\u2026\u201d\u201cSon, keep calm!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLook, doesn\u2019t he look possessed?\u201dAfter a few more minutes in the sun, He San finally became more like himself. He scratched the back of his head and blushed with shame when he realized the whole crowd was staring at him.\u201cAre you feeling better? Why did you faint inside the Haunted House?\u201d Uncle Xu in the park uniform passed a bottle of water to He San.\u201cI actually cannot recall for sure what had happened. I was so scared and ran into the first door that I saw. There was a bronze mirror on the wall, and I remembered someone calling my name, but I can\u2019t remember what happened after that,\u201d He San said with a face filled with confusion. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s something set up by the Haunted House?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a scenario related to a mirror inside the Haunted House?\u201d Uncle Xu turned toward Chen Ge, who was not looking so good.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was instantly reminded of the game from the previous night and how the thing inside the mirror had been stopped from escaping by the doll.From the look of it, the creature still had not left, hiding the mirrors of the Haunted House.\u201cBoss, is this a new thing just added to the Haunted House? How come I\u2019ve not heard of it before?\u201d Xu Wan also wandered over, pulling the gaze of the crowd along with her. Chen Ge was caught in an awkward position; he could not just confess that there was an actual ghost living inside the Haunted House, could he? If he did that, the Haunted House would be forced into closure, but more than that, he would be dragged to the mental hospital.\u201cI guess you can say that. It\u2019s related to the short video I uploaded last night, but I don\u2019t recommend playing this game without professional guidance.\u201d Chen Ge patted He San lightly on his shoulder. \u201cIf you do not take my advice, you might end up in the same state as this young man. Alright, who still wishes to visit the Haunted House? Don\u2019t worry, there are bound to be accidents in a Haunted House; that\u2019s what makes it interesting, yes?\u201d\u201cInteresting my backside! A man fainted! It\u2019s a Haunted House visit, so why should we put our lives on the line\u203d\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s right! I\u2019ll forget about my broken phone as long as you don\u2019t post any more weird ass videos in the middle of the night.\u201d\u201cThanks, but no thanks!\u201dAs Chen Ge extended the invitation, the crowd stepped away from him in unison. He laughed awkwardly. \u201cWhy are you all acting like that? My Haunted House is really not that scary.\u201d\u201cBro, we have two forensic science students who deal with dead bodies every day here; one is in tears, and the other fainted. Now, you\u2019re telling us your Haunted House is not scary? Who are you lying to? How can you lie without batting an eye?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, have some morals!\u201dThe comments from the crowd stumped Chen Ge. Initially, when the Haunted House was supposedly not scary, no one wanted to visit because, apparently, it was too boring. Now, when it was finally scary, it seemed to have overshot the effect he wanted. \u201cBut you came from all over the country just to stand at the entrance and watch? Guts can be trained; an occasional scare here and there will be able to increase your heart rate, thus improving your blood circulation.\u201d\u201cEven if you give us money, we\u2019re not going into that place. And improve blood circulation some more, you might as well say your Haunted House can cure cancer.\u201d The man who had his phone broken retorted before turning to leave.However, right then, a middle-aged uncle standing beside him suddenly raised his voice to say, \u201cBoss, give me a ticket!\u201dHis voice was firm like he had come to this decision after much contemplation.\u201cF*ck, there really are thrill-seekers everywhere.\u201d\u201cUncle, don\u2019t be rash. Other Haunted Houses take your money, but his Haunted House takes your life!\u201d\u201cUncle, you\u2019ve impressed me with your courage! Go on, don\u2019t worry, you can leave your wife and your daughter with me!\u201dThe uncle looked to be over forty, and his head was balding. He walked out from the crowd and gave Chen Ge ten dollars. \u201cOne ticket please.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re doing this alone?\u201d Even Chen Ge was impressed by this middle-aged man. He dared to do this after witnessing what had happened earlier\u203dAfter taking the money, Chen Ge gave the uncle his ticket. He was about to go through his introductions when the uncle took the ticket and walked off in the other direction from the Haunted House\u2019s gate.\u201cUncle, the door is right this way\u2026\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d The uncle did not turn back and continued to walk to a rather photogenic spot. He pulled out his phone to mess with the camera angle until he managed to encapsulate most of the Haunted House building in the frame. He snapped two pictures before posting them to his Facebook. \u201cThe weather today is perfect for a day-out. I personally recommend this Western Jiujiang City\u2019s House of Horrors. It scared the bejesus out of me when I visited the place, highly recommended.\u201dThe crowd could not help but roll their eyes.\u00a0All you did was stay at the entrance for about twenty minutes and purchase a ticket, you call that visiting the place?Before the crowd could say anything, the uncle already got likes and replies from his social circle.Xiao Li from Human Resources responded, \u201cBrother Zhang, you\u2019re scared of even the common rat but you dared to visit a Haunted House today? My man, nice job!\u201d\u201cThis means that the Haunted House isn\u2019t that scary if Ol\u2019 Zhang dares to visit it (wicked grin),\u201d replied Wang Da You.\u201cDinner is served, come home soon!!!\u201d Ol\u2019 Ball and Chain\u2019s response was relatively off-topic.Precious Daughter, Wang Jing, laughed. \u201cLOL, Dad, we\u2019re all very familiar with the type of courage you have, so stop with the hapless struggle.\u201dThe balding uncle didn\u2019t mind the comments but replied with a mischievous smile, \u201cFeel free to visit this place on your own. Since you all claim to be braver than I am, I\u2019m sure none of you will be afraid to take up this challenge, right?\u201dThis series of actions had stunned the crowd.\u201cUncle, how cunning you are! To prove that you\u2019re not a scaredy-cat, you\u2019re entrapping your very own wife and daughter\u2026\u201d The man who had broken his phone stood beside the uncle and saw the whole process. Then, he rushed toward Chen Ge and demanded, \u201cGive me a ticket as well!\u201dChen Ge had no explanation to this development, but since he was operating a business, he could not say no to his customers. After passing the young man his ticket, he saw the young man operate his broken phone to snap a picture and upload it onto Instagram with the caption, \u201cGod, what did I do? I realize I\u2019m easily scared, who can come to hold my hands as we challenge this Haunted House together\u203d\u201dReading through the many comments that appeared under his photo, the young man had a devilish smile on his face.\u201cGive me one ticket too.\u201d\u201cMe too!\u201d\u201cFifty percent off, you say? Then give me two!\u201dThere was no visitor inside the Haunted House, but the tickets in Chen Ge\u2019s hands quickly disappeared. In just a few minutes, about half the stack was gone. The crowd slowly dispersed, and Chen Ge started to happily count the day\u2019s earning.\u201cBoss, the tickets we sold this morning are more than the total tickets we have sold in the whole month.\u201d Xu Wan squatted down beside Chen Ge, and the excitement in her eyes could not be suppressed.\u201cWe merely got lucky today, to make sure we have a constant stream of visitors, we have to improve on our content first.\u201d Chen Ge placed the cash inside his pocket and turned to head back inside the Haunted House. It was then that he realized, his \u2018victims\u2019 of the day, Gao Ru Xue and He San, still hadn\u2019t left the scene.\u201cAre you two feeling any better?\u201d Chen Ge walked toward them with an offering of mineral water. After all, they were crucial to him having such good sales that day.\u201cYes, thank you, and sorry for the trouble,\u201d He San, who sat on the steps, uttered awkwardly.Beside him, the color still had not returned to Gao Ru Xue\u2019s face yet. Her gaze wandered between Chen Ge and Xu Wan before she said, \u201cI have two questions I want to ask, may I?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSure.\u201d Chen Ge nodded readily.\u201cNumber one, inside the West House, I swore I saw this girl\u2019s face in the mirror, so how could she suddenly appear behind me?\u201d Gao Ru Xue intended to get to the bottom of the truth. She had a hard time coming to terms with that fact that she had been so scared that she cried.\u201cYou think that\u2019s a normal mirror, but it\u2019s actually not. It\u2019s actually a triangular pillar with mirrors on each side, but the two other sides are normally hidden behind the wall. It can be moved with a slight push. The exit to the Minghun scenario is actually behind the mirror. Regarding the woman you saw in the mirror, it was merely a picture that was pasted at particular angle. Using lighting effects, the other mirror, and optical illusions, it creates the illusion that you\u2019re looking at a real person. Xiao Wan was actually hiding behind the mirror. The sound of footsteps you heard was merely a sound effect.\u201dGao Ru Xue nodded after listening to Chen Ge\u2019s explanation. \u201cAlright, the second question.\u201dShe pointed at Xu Wan. \u201cThis lady is obviously alive, but how come, looking at her, I have this feeling that I\u2019m looking at a dead body?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was not good at social events, but that did not bother her much because she felt more comfortable in the presence of dead bodies after all.\u201cOur Haunted House employs a special make-up technique, and that, combined with the unique environment of the Haunted House, creates nothing more than an illusion in your mind.\u201d The Mortician\u2019s Make-up as well as Black Friday were something that he could not attempt to explain even if he tried to. Therefore, he answered the question broadly and quickly moved the conservation away. \u201cIf there are no more questions, I\u2019ll need to get back to work. Thank you for visiting us today.\u201dAfter saying goodbye to the two students, Chen Ge ordered Xu Wan to go clear up the props in the Minghun scenario while he returned to the main control room alone.What really happened to He San was known to Chen Ge alone; the creature in the mirror hadn\u2019t left and was still hiding inside the Haunted House.Letting it stay will only create more problems for me in the future.\u00a0This was his first time dealing with a Nightmare Mission, so he had not expected that it would have such complicated repercussions. After turning off the background music, Chen Ge pulled out the surveillance camera to focus on the few minutes after He San entered the West House. After flipping through the videos captured from multiple angles, he soon discovered something.It was at 24 minutes and 11 seconds past 9 o\u2019 clock that He San ran into the West House. He was running about like a headless chicken.At 24 minutes and 14 seconds, when his eyes fell on the bronze mirror, a very curious image appeared on screen. The originally frantic He San became suspiciously calm after he saw the mirror. He stood before the mirror completely immobile. Chen Ge would have thought the video had stopped if not for the ticking time frame on screen.At 24 minutes and 17 seconds, He San suddenly raised his left hand and started to walk slowly toward the mirror. It looked like someone or something was dragging him toward the mirror!At 24 minutes and 20 seconds, Xu Wan, wearing a wedding dress, ran into the room from the open door. By then, He San\u2019s upper body was almost touching the mirror, and there was a flash of something in the mirror that was captured by the camera. Right after that, He San fainted to the ground.It was Xiao Wan\u2019s arrival that interrupted the creature\u2019s plan?\u00a0Chen Ge played the video on loop. Plenty of stuff happened in those ten seconds. He rubbed his temples, but he could not come up with a good solution.Until I can come up with a more permanent solution, it looks like the only thing I can do now is cover up all the mirrors in this Haunted House.\u00a0Chen Ge wandered back to the Props Room to grab several black clothes before returning to the Minghun set.\u201cBoss, why are you here? Just leave the cleaning up to me.\u201d Xu Wan saw Chen Ge while she was picking up the paper mannequins and paper money to put them back into coffin.\u201cI came to inform you of something. Temporarily, stop using all the props and scares related to mirrors in the Haunted House. Also, when you\u2019re working, make sure to stay away from mirrors.\u201d Chen Ge carried the black cloth as he helped Xu Wan close the fake coffin.Xu Wan was baffled by Chen Ge\u2019s orders, but she didn\u2019t ask. After fixing all the props in the Main House, Chen Ge entered the West House alone.The white lantern cast its weak light into the room. He stood at the spot where He San fainted and stared quietly at the bronze mirror.\u201cSomeone lives inside the mirror? Could there really be another world inside the mirror?\u201d Chen Ge touched the icy surface of the glass and stared at his own reflection for a long time. He could not pinpoint it, but he felt like something was off.\u00a0When I handed He San the bottle of water earlier, he used his right hand to take it, which means that he\u2019s not left-handed. However, in the video, he raised his left-hand. Why would he do something that is opposite of his usual habit? Was he taken control of by the thing in the mirror?Chen Ge placed his left hand on the mirror, which aligned perfectly with his mirrored right hand.\u00a0After all, everything is inverted inside the mirror.After covering the mirror with a black cloth, Chen Ge pulled out the black phone.\u00a0This is where it all started; the creature appeared because of this phone. Therefore, it makes sense that if I wish to vanquish it, I\u2019ll need the help of this phone.He opened the app with the Haunted House icon and soon noticed some changes to the interface. The Daily Visitor Number and Monthly Visitor Number had each increase by two.Under the window for unlockable scenarios, a Trial Mission had just become available. After clicking on it, the message said that after finishing the mission, the scenario that it corresponded to would be unlocked.The design of this game seems fair enough. Completing a mission will earn me a reward, and the level of the reward directly corresponds to the difficulty of the mission. If I wish to expand this place further and deal with the thing inside the mirror, I\u2019ll need to continue finishing these missions.He could only do one Daily Mission each day, so Chen Ge\u2019s eyes naturally wandered toward the Trial Mission.\u201cMurder by Midnight\u2014A dangerous psychotic patient wandered about a fallen apartment. Scissors and mallets as hands, he is just wandering outside of your room.\u201cMission Venue: Western Countryside\u2019s Ping An Apartments.\u201cMission Requirement: Reach the Mission Venue before 23:00 today. Look for the party responsible for the murder and survive until dawn.\u201cMission Hints: He hides among the crowd like a wolf among a group of sheep. His kind exterior hides a sickened heart.\u201cDo you wish to accept this mission? Warning: Trial Missions are only available for 24 hours. If they are not accepted within these 24 hours, the scenario will never be unlocked.\u201dChen Ge still had some reservations initially, but he decided to accept it after reading the last sentence.Let come what may. Things are finally looking up for the Haunted House; I can\u2019t give up on any opportunity that will make it better.After accepting the mission, he scrolled down. The Haunted Wheel of Misfortune had been activated without him knowing. Chen Ge clicked on it out of curiosity, and a line of words appeared on screen.\u201cThe Decree of Life and Death is never the decision of man; fortune and misfortune are only one inch apart. We have both Spirit Fruits to increase your life span as well as hatred-filled Baleful Specters!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cActivating the Wheel after collecting the visitor\u2019s scream for the first time. You\u2019ve been given a free spin for the first activation. (A scream will be collected when it is over seventy decibels. After collecting one hundred screams, they can be traded for a chance to spin the Wheel of Misfortune.)\u201dOne hundred screams for one spin?\u00a0Chen Ge frowned reading this detail.\u00a0This wheel is horrible on so many levels. The condition for activating it is already so difficult, but the result is still randomized\u203d If the result is a baleful specter, then wouldn\u2019t it have been a complete waste?Chen Ge looked at the box that said he had one spin left, and he felt like pressing it. This feeling was similar to when one saw a message appear on one\u2019s phone; it might just have been an advertisement, but one felt compelled to open it.I mean, what can possibly go wrong?\u00a0Chen Ge told himself, and as his finger tapped the screen lightly, the wheel started to turn.As long as it\u2019s not a Baleful Specter, I\u2019m fine with anything!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The wheel gradually slowed until the needle stopped at one of the results.\u201cLucky Spin completed, congratulations for having won a Rare Special Item: Cursed Love Letter (Chance of Winning: 3/1000!)\u201cHer eyes exposed, cheeks white as ash, the moment she fell off the building, she became the taboo of the school. In red dancing shoes and a blood-dyed uniform, even her name became something that was only uttered in frantic whispers. People pretended that she didn\u2019t exist, until one day, someone started receiving her love letters again.\u201cGetting a Baleful Spirit on your first Lucky Spin, unlocked Rare Title: The Specters\u2019 Favored.\u201cThe Specters\u2019 Favored: When you equip this title, there\u2019s a chance you might receive help from the specters.\u201dLooking at the information on screen, Chen Ge felt like his head was spinning.Cursed Love Letter? A 3/1000 chance of winning it? The Specters\u2019 Favored? Before resolving the matter with the creature in the mirror, now I\u2019m blessed with another one\u203d I don\u2019t even know whether I should consider myself lucky or unlucky.He regretted cursing himself before activating the lucky spin.\u00a0Chen Ge, get a grip of yourself! This is not the worst yet; drawing a Baleful Specter doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll appear instantly. Perhaps there is still time to salvage this, maybe I should go light an incense at the nearby temple.He pocketed his phone, and his fingers brushed up against something papery in his pocket. He lowered his head and was shocked to see a yellowed letter poking out of his pocket. With a bad feeling settling in his stomach, Chen Ge pulled out the letter carefully, and there was only a single, simple sentence written on it that was braided using hair: \u201cI like you.\u201dWhat the f*ck! Please, tell me what you like about me, and I\u2019ll change from this moment on!The handwriting on the paper had a nice curve to it; it would look quite nice if not for the fact that it was braided from hair.Chen Ge stood in the West House, holding the letter in his hands. He mumbled to himself, \u201cWho would have thought the first love letter I\u2019ve ever received in my life would be something like this\u2026\u201d\u201cBoss! What are you grumbling to yourself in here?\u201d Xiao Wan came in from behind him after she was done fixing all the stuff in the Main House.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing; I\u2019m just thinking. If someone knows his life will end soon, is it right for him to give up on materialistic pursuit to focus on leaving some good deeds in this world?\u201d Chen Ge raised his head to look at Xiao Wan in dead man\u2019s make-up. \u201cFor example, to do his best to help produce the human race\u2019s next generation.\u201dChen Ge was obviously just rambling, but Xu Wan looked at him as if in deep thought, and her face turned serious with contemplation.\u201cXiao Wan, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re thinking about saying yes? Thanks, but I\u2019m not ready yet. Then again, we\u2019ve worked with each other for a long time already, and we do make a great team. I guess if you insist, I suppose I wouldn\u2019t have said no\u2026\u201d For some reason, Chen Ge felt weirdly nervous.\u201cNo, Boss, it\u2019s not that. I\u2019m just curious how you managed to have two shadows following you.\u201d Xu Wan pointed behind Chen Ge. \u201cIs this some new thing you\u2019ve invented?\u201d\u201cTwo shadows\u203d\u201d Chen Ge whipped his head around and saw two shadows, one big and one small, encroaching upon him before finally melding into one. \u201cWhat the f*ck!\u201dHe yanked Xu Wan out of the Haunted House immediately.Chen Ge finally relaxed when he felt the sun on his skin. He did not give Xu Wan any explanation as he collapsed onto the steps.\u201cBoss, you\u2019ve been acting very out of sorts lately, is it because of the financial pressure?\u201d Xu Wan sat down beside Chen Ge. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure everything will be fine. By the way, what do you want to have for lunch? I\u2019ll go buy something for you.\u201dListening to Xu Wan\u2019s words of comfort, Chen Ge also did not know how to answer. He forced a smile and said, \u201cI\u2019ll just have the same as you, but before you go out, remember to remove your make-up, lest you scare the canteen workers.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dAfter Xu Wan left, Chen Ge pulled out the love letter again.\u00a0I saw the two shadows joining together with my own eyes; if this is a sign that I\u2019ve been haunted by the specter, does it mean that it\u2019s hiding in my shadow?Chen Ge looked at his shadow unblinkingly.\u00a0With The Specters\u2019 Favored title, I have a chance to earn the aid from the specters, so in way, winning a Baleful Specter might not be as bad as I thought.At least that was what Chen Ge told himself on the surface. He knew internally, the reason a Baleful Specter was called a Baleful Specter was because they died with great anguish. They radiated sin and curses. If he was slightly careless, he might easily end up dead in a ditch somewhere.After lunch, Chen Ge stood in front of the Haunted House, handing out flyers. There were quite a number of park visitors, but none wanted to enter the Haunted House.Bored out of his mind, Chen Ge opened his video sharing app page and realized there had been a few new private messages. Deleting the trolls and advertisement, Chen Ge personally replied the remaining messages. Soon, he came across a message from He San.The honest-looking young man surreptitiously came to contact Chen Ge, telling him his school\u2019s forum had been exploding. After they found out that his Haunted House had played such a big prank on the beauty of their course, many students had stated the desire to level the Haunted House. Someone had started a thread to form the warring party, and it had more than a handful of volunteers already.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be young,\u201d Chen Ge commented with upturned lips. In his mind, however, there was already a vision of hormonal youths quivering in a group trapped inside his Haunted House.\u201cAfter completing the Trial Mission, I\u2019ll have them try it out to see how scary the 1-star scenario really is.\u201dThe thought of the Trial Mission made Chen Ge turn serious. He only had a one-time chance to complete this mission. If he failed, the chance of unlocking that scenario would forever be lost. He looked through the phone to memorize all the available information.Knowing one\u2019s enemy is winning half the battle. Therefore, the first thing Chen Ge did after confirming the mission venue was to look up everything he could about the place on the internet.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cJiujiang City Western Countryside\u2019s Ping An Apartments.\u201dKeying in the name of the location came up with nothing initially. After flipping through the front few pages, Chen Ge finally found something related to this apartment listed on a secondhand house sale website.It was a complaint saying that the seller had the intention of obscuring the truth. In reality, this apartment was a literal haunted house. After peeling off the fresh coat of paint, there were signs of dried blood, and every night, the apartment would be filled with the disgusting smell of decay.No one answered the complaint, and it was soon swamped by other more interesting threads. Chen Ge looked at the time of posting, and it was nine months ago.Staying overnight at a haunted house and having to look for a hidden murderer\u2026 Sigh, this is a bit harder than I thought.\u00a0Chen Ge had studied toy design; he was a complete amateur when it came investigation and self-defense.\u00a0The hard part is not staying at the haunted house but what if the murderer is just living next door to me and jumps at me at night\u203dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He studied the roomful of items as if deep in thought.What do you need to prepare to spend a night with a murderer?Identity card, phone, charger, lighter, penknife, multi-uses hammer\u2026 Right, mustn\u2019t forget this doll as well.\u00a0Chen Ge shoved the doll that appeared before the mirror the previous night into his bag, and after confirming he had everything he needed, he pulled the zipper of the bag close and left the room.\u201cXiao Wan, you can get off work early today. Remember to lock the door when you leave; I have something to attend to do, so I\u2019ll go first.\u201d\u201cBoss, it\u2019s only 5 pm. Are you going on a trip or something?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve left the key on the table in the props room, see you tomorrow morning.\u201dNoticing Chen Ge\u2019s attempt at changing the subject, Xu Wan helplessly replied, \u201cOkay.\u201dHowever, as Chen Ge turned around, the girl dropped the Haunted House flyers and shot toward the props room in a trail of smoke.\u201cThis girl\u2026\u201d The evening wind ruffled the flyers that were left on the table. Chen Ge shook his head and picked up a pebble to place over them as he sighed.Hopefully she won\u2019t be seeing me on the morning news.Underneath his calm surface, Chen Ge\u2019s heart was a chaotic mess. The Nightmare Mission from the night before had opened a whole new world to him and made him realize there was a certain level of danger to the missions dispensed by the black phone.Trial Mission has to be more difficult than Daily Mission; I have to be more careful tonight.Before the night fell, Chen Ge rode his bicycle to head toward Ping An Apartments. The Mission Information only gave the name of the location. To locate the place, Chen Ge used Google Maps and the information from the online complaint released nine months ago. Even so, he still exhausted two hours before he reached his destination.Are there even people who want to live a place that is so barren and isolated?The road leading to the apartment building was winding and overgrown with wild brushes. There was a noticeable lack of street lighting, and through the tree branches, Chen Ge could catch glimpses of a gray-colored building.On the way there, Chen Ge asked as many people as he could, but most of them hadn\u2019t heard of Ping An Apartments. In the end, it was a senior who was about sixty years old that pointed him down the correct road and added a little friendly advice. He told Chen Ge that the place was haunted and cursed, so most would give it a wide berth even in daylight.Chen Ge did not know how to answer. If not for the sake of the black phone\u2019s mission, who would voluntarily go spend a night at a place like that\u203dIt\u2019s now 6.50 pm, and the mission states that I have to be there by 11 pm. This means that I still have time to have a quick look around.\u00a0Following the winding road, Chen Ge entered deep into the forest. After travelling for quite some time, he finally saw the legendary cursed house.The yard was surrounded by a tall grey wall, and there was only one exit. Even though the gate that opened on both sides was rusty with age, there was a brand-new lock on it.Weird, the lock is so new, but the gate looks old, but wait, what\u2019s this?\u00a0There was a piece of white paper stuck to the iron bars of the gate. Chen Ge assumed it was a flyer, but when he pointed his flashlight at it, he realized it was a missing person\u2019s notice.\u201cZhang Qing, Female, 27 years old, 157 cm tall, on the thin side. There is a beauty mark beneath her right eye. She likes to wear red clothes. If you have any information, please contact Mr. Wang. Monetary rewards will be provided!\u201dThe notice came with this Mr. Wang\u2019s contact number and address. The thing that caught Chen Ge\u2019s attention was that the address listed on the notice was the address of this cursed apartment.\u201cThis sure is weird.\u201d Chen Ge\u2019s ghost sense was tingling. He pulled out his phone to snap a picture of the notice before entering the compound. The place was bigger than he had expected. The main building had three floors, and there were two buildings that looked like a storeroom and a water pump room next to it.Based on the peeling of its paint, I believe this place is at least twenty to thirty years old already.\u00a0However, the place was not as unkempt as one might have assumed it to be. The place was clean, there was no litter, and even the lawn was carefully mown.After he placed his bicycle in the lawn, Chen Ge walked into the main building with his backpack. \u201cHello, is anyone there?\u201dThe long corridor was shadowy. About ten seconds later, the door closest to the stairs opened up a sliver.\u201cGood afternoon.\u201d Chen Ge walked toward the door, but the person behind it did not seem particularly hospitable since the door stopped after opening just a sliver. The lights in the room were not on, and Chen Ge could just about make out the shape of a woman behind the door. Her eyes were bloodshot, like she was fond of sleeping late. It made her look extremely tired.\u201cI wish to ask how much it will cost me to spend a night here,\u201d Chen Ge said in a tone that was as kind and soft as he could. However, to his bafflement, the only answer he got was a giggle, and the door slammed in his face.\u201cHuh?\u201d Before he understood what just happened, he heard footsteps coming from the second floor. The only voice-activated light that was installed at the corner of the corridor lit up, and a limping middle-aged man was coming down.He seemed to have overheard Chen Ge because the first thing he said was, \u201cYou want to stay at my place? How long do you plan to stay?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the landlord?\u201d Chen Ge walked over. \u201cI just wish to stay for one night?\u201d\u201cJust one night?\u201d The limping man gave Chen Ge a once-over like he was trying to read his mind. \u201cFine, give me your ID, and the payment is made at the second floor.\u201dChen Ge was about to follow the man upstairs when there a loud sound came from outside. It sounded like someone had swung the iron gate open. Hearing this, the limping man frowned, and his features twisted with displeasure. He stopped moving, and Chen Ge had no choice but to wait as well. Not long after that, in walked another middle-aged man who looked awfully tired. He was wearing old, tattered clothes and was holding a stack of papers in his hand.\u201cWang Qi, how many times I\u2019ve told you, your girlfriend is not here\u203d If you insist on being this stubborn, I\u2019ll have to call the police!\u201d The limping man stood in the middle of the stairs to block the path.The other man ignored him and continued upstairs with his head lowered.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHey, I\u2019m talking to you!\u201d The limping man kicked, causing the unprepared middle-aged man to knock into the wall. The stack of papers slipped from his hands and fluttered all over the staircase. One of them happened to land beside Chen Ge\u2019s feet.It\u2019s the same as the missing person\u2019s notice that I saw outside,\u00a0Chen Ge thought to himself as he narrowed his eyes. He silently picked it up before continuing to follow the drama that was happening before him.The middle-aged man did not retaliate against the limping man\u2019s attack. He crawled up slowly from the ground and carried on to wordlessly pick up the notices that littered the ground. He reminded Chen Ge of a lumbering, lifeless zombie.\u201cDon\u2019t mind him, the man\u2019s crazy.\u201d The limping man waved at Chen Ge, ushering him to come upstairs. It seemed like he had given up on the middle-aged man.Crazy?\u00a0When Chen Ge passed the middle-aged man, he surreptitiously glanced at him.\u00a0The mission information did mention a psycho, so could this be him?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Lonelytree\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Millman97Chen Ge\u2019s first impression of Wang Qi was \u2018weary, torpid, and weak\u2019. As they brushed past each other, Chen Ge handed the other man back the notice he had picked up earlier, and Wang Qi thanked him with a wavering voice. This was the first time Chen Ge had heard the man speak. It sounded gravelly, which gave Chen Ge some trouble in understanding him.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Chen Ge responded with a smile before he turned to follow the limping man up the stairs.The second floor was even more dilapidated than the first floor. The place was dark and humid, the corners were filled with uncleaned spider webs, and the walls looked like they had been slashed with knives. The limping man led Chen Ge to the very end of the long corridor. He opened the last room before coming out with a long chain of keys. \u201cOne night is fifty dollars, take a pick of any room you like on this floor.\u201d\u201c50 dollars? That\u2019s too expensive!\u201d\u201cMy apartment is the only place to stay within several kilometers; you should be thankful I only charge you fifty.\u201d When the man was talking, his eyes kept unconsciously moving to look behind him like he was checking out something.\u201cFine, but why must I stay on the second floor, is the room on first or third floor not available?\u201d\u201cWhy do you have no many damn questions? They\u2019re off the limits, that\u2019s why!\u201d The limping man grabbed the fifty away from Chen Ge and shoved a random key in his hand. \u201cThe room number is written on the key, go look for it yourself.\u201dThen, he rushed back into the room. The moment the door closed, Chen Ge could hear the muffled croak of an old man coming from inside the room, like the sound one would make when one had food stuck in one\u2019s throat. Frowning with suspicion, Chen Ge placed his palm on the door, saying, \u201cWait a minute.\u201d\u201cWhat now\u203d\u201d the limping man asked with annoyance.Chen Ge glanced through the slight opening of the door. The space within looked small. Other than the limping man that stood at the door, there was an old man reclining in a wheelchair that was facing away from the door. He was probably the source of the noise Chen Ge heard earlier.\u201cI\u2019m rather thirsty, does your establishment provide a vending machine or things like that?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cMan, is this how you treat your customer\u2026\u201dThe door slammed in his face, leaving Chen Ge in the corridor with a heavier suspicion brewing in his heart.For a normal apartment building, the reception is normally at the front door, but for this building, the reception is not only on the second floor but at the very end of the second-floor corridor.\u00a0Looking at the key in his hand, many questions appeared in his mind.\u00a0Why are the first and third floors off limits? And who is the old man living with the landlord?The number 208 was written on the key, and coincidentally enough, the room was just next to the landlord\u2019s.Regardless, let me go put down my stuff first.\u00a0After two hours of travelling, Chen Ge was indeed more than a bit tired. As he opened the door, the smell of mildew hit him in the nose. The room had probably been vacant for a long time because the place was covered with dust, and the bed was overgrown with some mysterious looking fungus. It felt strange under Chen Ge\u2019s touch.Is this bed even usable?\u00a0Before Chen Ge even placed his backpack down, he heard a loud crash coming from next door. It sounded like a plate had fallen and shattered. Chen Ge closed the door and stuck his ear to the wall, trying to eavesdrop. Soon enough, the sound of the limping man cursing came. In his anger, he let out several foreign curses, and based on his accent, the man sounded like he was not a local.The old man mumbled weakly in reply. The limping man continued scolding for several minutes before he stopped, but what happened next confused Chen Ge. The volume of the television was increased.What\u2019s going on? What is he doing? Why did he increase the television\u2019s volume?Chen Ge tried to listen for more clues, but all he could hear was the television. He soon gave up.\u00a0So be it. In any case, I should be more worried about myself; I doubt I\u2019ll be able to get any sleep tonight.Chen Ge placed his backpack on the table and took out the penknife, placing it in his pocket.\u00a0The online complaint mentioned the existence of blood stains behind the paint and the presence of a horrible smell at night. However, I\u2019ve searched all the information available on Ping An Apartments online, and there was no mention of any murders that happened here.Then again, there had to be some kind of secret hidden at Ping An Apartments for it to have been selected as the mission venue by the black phone. He pulled out the multi-purpose hammer to knock and inspect every corner of the room; he came up with nothing. This was a very normal guest room; other than the sorry state it was in, there was nothing out of ordinary about it.Since the landlord only allowed me to pick a room on the second floor, this means that the rooms on the second floor are mostly fine, or else he wouldn\u2019t have opened it up for rent. Therefore, to get to the bottom of this, I have to go take a look on the first or third floor.\u00a0The Trial Mission was supposed to start at 11 pm. There were still three hours until then. Chen Ge did not want to waste time. He put the hammer away and slunk toward the door.With his hand on the doorknob, he pushed it open. However, he stopped half-way. His palm started to sweat, and a chill ran down his spin.The limping man was standing just outside his door; God only knew how long for!The man also did not expect that Chen Ge would suddenly open the door. Both parties on either side of the door were equally shocked.\u201cLandlord, why are you standing at my door?\u201d Chen Ge narrowed his eyes at the man; the more time he spent with the limping man, the uneasier he felt.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you were thirsty? I came to give you this.\u201d The limping man placed the warm water bottle in his hands by Chen Ge\u2019s door, and his expression was as unnatural as it could be.\u201cThank you.\u201d Chen Ge did not point out how weird he was acting and pulled the bottle into the room. \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s all. Do rest early.\u201d The limping man glanced inside the room and added as if to himself, \u201cThe corridors are not fitted with lights, so they\u2019re very dark at night; you\u2019d better stay in your room after the sun sets.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe turned to leave. Chen Ge sighed in relief when the door next to him closed.This landlord is easily angered and socially inept. Even though he has a limp, that doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s physically weak. He managed to shove the man earlier to the ground with just one kick; if anything, he should be quite powerful.Chen Ge wasn\u2019t a particularly good sleuth; the only thing he could do was try to fit the situation at the apartments into the plot of all the past murder mysteries he had seen.\u00a0Born with a disability might have caused him to be bullied from a young age, and that corrupted his innocence. That could easily evolve into a mental sickness. F*ck, it sounds like he\u2019s the perfect candidate for a crazed murderer!Chen Ge put the bottle away, and a pressing question came into his mind.\u00a0If the landlord is the murderer, then doesn\u2019t this mean I\u2019m going to have to spend the whole night next to a murderer?This thought made Chen Ge\u2019s skin crawl. Who knew, the man might spend the whole night standing outside his door, waiting to entrap him! To make matters worse, since he was the landlord, he had access to the space keys, which enable him to enter any room as he wished!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The landlord is suspicious, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s really the murderer.\u201d Chen Ge scratched his head and said to himself, \u201cPerhaps I should talk to some of the tenants for more details.\u201dSince Chen Ge arrived at the apartment, he had seen four different individuals: the woman hiding behind the door; Wang Qi, the person who pasted those missing person notices all over the place; the recalcitrant landlord; and the old man in the wheelchair.\u201cThe old man stays with the landlord, so speaking to him is out of the question. The lady on the first floor weirds me out, so the only remaining candidate is Wang Qi. He should know some things about this apartment.\u201d Chen Ge placed the bottle in the room, locked the door behind him and went downstairs.The voice-activated light came on, giving Chen Ge enough light to see Wang Qi hugging the stack of notices, walking down the corridor. He slipped a notice under each door, regardless of whether they were occupied or not. This naturally attracted Chen Ge\u2019s attention. Normally, missing person notices were posted at places with high traffic, but this man personally focused on these apartments, which seemed quite deserted.Chen Ge followed behind Wang Qi quietly. It was not until Wang Qi finished slipping the last notice under the door that he said, \u201cBrother, I can understand your feeling of having a loved one vanish, but you should stay strong and not do this kind of meaningless action to torture yourself.\u201dWang Qi slowly turned around up hearing Chen Ge\u2019s voice. His clouded pupils seemed unable to find a point to focus on. \u201cUnderstand? None of you will ever understand how I feel, nor have I asked for your understanding\u2026\u201dChen Ge did not waste time going down this rabbit hole with him. He grabbed his phone and searched for the police report he made when his parents disappeared several months ago. \u201cI\u2019m not lying to you. My parents suddenly disappeared half a year ago, and at the beginning, I was feeling down in the dumps, too.\u201dLooking at the picture saved in the phone, Wang Qi was silent for a long time before he said, \u201cI emphasize with your situation, but our circumstances are different. My fianc\u00e9 will return; I can feel that she hasn\u2019t gone far.\u201d\u201cDo you mind telling me your story? Considering we\u2019re somewhat in the same boat, perhaps I can help you,\u201d Chen Ge said. Weirdly enough, he found himself meaning what he said.Wang Qi hesitated. Perhaps recalling that Chen Ge had helped him pick up his notice earlier, his gaze that fell on Chen Ge softened. \u201cThank you, but you won\u2019t be able to help me. You\u2019re a nice young man, so listen to my advice, run away while you still can. Don\u2019t try to spend a night here!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already paid. You\u2019ll have to give me a more convincing reason if you want me to pack up and leave.\u201d Chen Ge\u2019s purpose there was to complete the Trial Mission. If he surrendered, he would lose the opportunity to unlock the Murder by Midnight scenario forever.\u201cIs your life more important or your money?\u201d Wang Qi looked about them, and after making sure there was no peeping eyes, he lowered his voice to say, \u201cEveryone here knows there have been murders in this building before.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard a thing or two about that, but I failed to find any information on it on the internet; I suspect that\u2019s merely a rumor,\u201d Chen Ge replied.\u201cPreviously, this building was called Fu An Apartments; it was after the incident that the name changed to Ping An Apartments. The murders were big news at the time, and until now, they haven\u2019t been solved. The will of the dead hasn\u2019t been appeased, so they appear at their place of death every day at midnight,\u201d Wang Qi said. It sounded like he really believed it.\u201cYou still believe ghost stories like that at an age like ours?\u201d Chen Ge smiled awkwardly. Internally, he was incredibly nervous because he knew better than anyone how real the other world was. If possible, he really did not want to have any more encounters with these spirits.\u201cInitially, I did not believe it either\u2026 that is until the day my fianc\u00e9 disappeared around this area.\u201d Wang Qi pulled on his hair out of frustration, his fatigue plain as day.\u201cWhy would your fianc\u00e9 come to a place like this in the first place?\u201d Chen Ge was intrigued. The thing that happened to this Wang Qi\u2019s fianc\u00e9 was curiously similar to what happened to his parents.\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t really know. In fact, I had not even heard of this apartment before her disappearance. I got the place\u2019s name from the police; they told me it was at this place that all clues were lost.\u201d Wang Qi\u2019s hands relaxed, and several strands of hair hung listlessly between his fingers. \u201cI\u2019ve run out of ideas, and that\u2019s why I moved in here.\u201d\u201cThen, have you discovered anything?\u201dWang Qi\u2019s lips fell open, but before he could say anything, he suddenly stopped himself. Instead, he reached into his pocket to pull out his phone to type something on it.\u201cMy fianc\u00e9 has been kidnapped by the people who live here!\u201dChen Ge was dumbfounded reading the typed message; he had not expected this development. \u201cBrother, a kidnapping and a disappearance are two very different thing.\u201dWang Qi shushed Chen Ge, telling him to be quiet. He turned his back toward the corridor and flipped his phone over to show Chen Ge. Chen Ge saw the messages in the phone inbox, and his eyes slowly widened with shock.There was a message from Wang Qi\u2019s fianc\u00e9 in his phone!The content was simple, it only had two words\u2014\u2019Save me!\u2019 However, the most spine-chilling discovery was the message was sent at 2 am last night.\u201cSomeone who should have disappeared sent you a SOS message in the middle of the night?\u201d After the initial shock, Chen Ge quickly calmed down. \u201cThen, why didn\u2019t you go to the police with this message? Obviously, your fianc\u00e9 is still alive.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou might not believe me when I tell you this, but I receive this message from my fianc\u00e9 every night after midnight. The content is always the same, but the key point is every time after I wake up, the message will have miraculously disappeared like it never really happened.\u201d Wang Qi pointed at his bloodshot eyes. \u201cTo preserve this message, I haven\u2019t closed my eyes for 24 hours already.\u201d\u201cThe message will disappear once you fall asleep?\u201d This was the first time Chen Ge had heard something as curious as that.\u201cI know you think I\u2019m crazy, but everything I\u2019ve said is the truth.\u201d Wang Qi leaned against the wall for support as he pocketed his phone. \u201cMore inexplicable things have happened to me. For example, my fianc\u00e9\u2019s stuff curiously appears in my room without warning; it\u2019s like she\u2019s reminding me to go look for her.\u201dWhen Wang Qi said the last sentence, Chen Ge\u2019s eyelids twitched. Based on his experience from the past few days, Wang Qi\u2019s fianc\u00e9 had not disappeared but befallen an accident and transformed into a ghost. She was haunting Wang Qi; that was the only logical explanation, provided the man had not been lying to him.\u201cMy fianc\u00e9 disappeared around this apartment building, and my life has been changed by this apartment building. Listen to me, this place is cursed. It\u2019s the home of many evil ghosts and specters. Misfortune befalls those who get too close, so leave when you still can.\u201d It seemed that Wang Qi had not uttered so many words at one go in a very long time, for his face was stark-white as if the conversation had taken a great toll out on him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Lonelytree\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Millman97From a stranger\u2019s perspective, Wang Qi might have appeared to be too insistent in chasing the newcomer away. Therefore, Chen Ge did not promise the man anything; if anything, after listening to Wang Qi\u2019s story, he had a sneaking suspicion that the man was hiding something.\u201cI\u2019ve told you everything I know, and there\u2019s still time to leave. When the clock strikes twelve, the apartment will turn into something else.\u201d After saying that, Wang Qi brushed the dust away from his clothes and turned to leave.It was not until Wang Qi\u2019s shadow disappeared among the darkness of the night that Chen Ge came to. His original intention was to obtain more information from the tenants about the building, but now, he ended up with more question than answers.That man sure is a curious character, but I can\u2019t tell whether he\u2019s crazy or not.Recalling Wang Qi\u2019s pair of cloudy eyes that had not focused once throughout their conversation, Chen Ge felt uncomfortable. The pain and tiredness in the man\u2019s eyes could not be faked.\u00a0But it does seem like he loves his fianc\u00e9 dearly.As Chen Ge went back to his room, he paused when he passed the woman\u2019s room on the first floor. He hesitated before knocking on the room.\u201cHey, fresh blood!\u201d The woman\u2019s room door remained unmoved, but to Chen Ge\u2019s surprise, the door to the room directly opposite from hers fell open. A lanky man was leaning against the open door. He looked to be in his thirties, and the man\u2019s appearance was very unkempt. His beard was almost joined to his hair, and the back of his hand had a tattoo of a peony.\u201cAnd you are?\u201d Chen Ge turned around with alarm.\u201cThe man who was spreading the missing person notice around is not even a tenant of this building; there\u2019s something wrong about him up here.\u201d The thin man pointed at his temple. \u201cDon\u2019t believe a word out that comes out of his mouth, and try not to get too close to him.\u201dIt was the first time Chen Ge had seen this man, and even though the man\u2019s appearance left much to be desired, the man\u2019s mannerisms were the most normal of all the characters he had met at the apartment. \u201cThe man\u2019s actions sure are weird, but perhaps that is because he was too devastated from the loss of his fianc\u00e9.\u201d\u201cDid he tell you his fianc\u00e9 disappeared around this apartment?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDid he tell you he receive that information from the police and that\u2019s why he has been searching for her here?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe man chuckled mirthlessly before saying, \u201cI\u2019ve lived here for nine months already, and I\u2019ve seen no trace of the police coming here. The mad man is lying to you; I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t believe his talk of ghosts, right?\u201dHe pulled out a cigarette to dangle on his lips. \u201cThere are no ghosts in this world! At most, it\u2019s someone pretending to be a ghost. In any case, it\u2019s getting late, so you\u2019d better return to your room.\u201dChen Ge thanked the man and turned to leave. As he wandered up the steps, he thought to himself,\u00a0Obviously, one of them is lying, but which is it?Lost in his thoughts, Chen Ge did not realize he had walked up to the third floor. The faded number was printed on the corner of the wall, and the voice-activated light above his head flickered on and off. Chen Ge looked down the long corridor and realized this whole floor was in a state of complete disrepair. The floor was thick with grime, and there were signs of burning everywhere. The coating of the wall was peeling off like skin, and underneath it were lines that looked like thick cuts.Why have they left the third floor unfixed? Not enough budget, or is there a more sinister reason?The voice-activated light soon went off, and Chen Ge was submerged in a world of darkness. Due to his work at the Haunted House, Chen Ge was used to working in the darkness. The sudden blindness did not unhinge him. He pulled out his phone and was about to turn the flashlight on when he spotted a shadow dash past the darkened corridor.\u201cWho\u2019s there\u203d\u201d The flashlight on the phone lit up the third floor, but the shadow was nowhere to be seen. Chen Ge was about to investigate further when he heard footsteps coming up from further down the stairs.It\u2019s the landlord?\u00a0If he was spotted by the easily-irked landlord loitering on third floor, he might get chased off the premises. Chen Ge thought about it, pocketed his phone, and stealthily retreated down to the second floor.When he turned the corner on the stairwell, Chen Ge saw a rotund and short man coming out of a room on the second floor, holding a basin. The man was humming a happy tune, but when he saw Chen Ge, his face fell, and he immediately ran away from the scene.What is the meaning of that? Do I look that scary?\u00a0After returning to his room, Chen Ge lay in bed, hugging his backpack.\u00a0It feels like there\u2019s no normal individual in this apartment; every single one of them could be the party responsible for the murders.When those words rolled off his tongue, Chen Ge suddenly sat up in bed.\u00a0Wait a minute, the mission told me to find the party responsible for the murders, but the term \u2018party\u2019 can be both singular and plural! In that case, could there be more than one murderer\u203d After all, if there is more than one murder, the chances of multiple murderers will drastically increase. I need to get more information on that case from years ago.Chen Ge pulled out his phone. His conversation with Wang Qi was not for nothing. He now had the important information that before it was called Ping An Apartments, this place was called Fu An Apartments.He keyed in Jiujiang Fu An Apartments in the search box, and several pages later, numerous spine-chilling headlines jumped out at him.\u201cA family of four brutally murdered! The murderer has disappeared into thin air\u203d\u201d\u201cAccident or homicide? The truth of the fire that razed Fu An Apartments.\u201d\u201cCase within a case, bodies hidden inside the building unearthed!\u201dReading through the information on Fu An Apartments, Chen Ge felt his skin chilled. This was not fiction; they happened in real life, and he was currently living at the crime scene.Five years ago, a neighbor saw the smog rising from Fu An Apartments, so he called the fire brigade. The firefighters soon put out the fire and started to investigate the source of the fire as well as gauge the extent of damage.Initially, they thought this was going to be another accidental fire case, but as the investigation continued, more curious evidence started to surface.The cement walls were cracked, the surface of cracked window was small, and the smog blackened the ceiling; these were all signs that the temperature of the fire was high, and it spread very fast.There were several possible initial locations found at the building, and they were all far apart from each other, quintessential of an arson case.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTherefore, the nature of the investigation changed. After the police stepped in, they soon discovered four burnt bodies among the ruin of the fire. They believed these were the bodies of the family of four who operated the rental apartment.This case created quite a buzz at the time. The police tried their best to solve the case, but the fire had destroyed most of the evidence. They combed the place but could not locate the evidence of a fifth person much, less catch the culprit.The apartment was sealed for a whole year, after which ownership of the estate was passed on to the owner\u2019s father, and it was then that Fu An Apartments changed to Ping An Apartments.The family of four was burned to the death, and the culprit still hasn\u2019t been caught. No wonder people say this place is haunted.\u00a0After knowing more about the case, Chen Ge felt slightly more grounded because at least he knew what he was dealing with.A curious detail on the reports stuck out at him.\u00a0The articles all confirm that at the time of passing, the owner was already 41 years old. The apartment was later passed on to his father, and theoretically and logically speaking, the real current owner of this place should be in his 60s or 70s already.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Lonelytree\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Millman97There was only one person who fit the criteria: the old man sharing the room with the \u2018landlord\u2019.This is weird; according to the news articles, the owner should be an old man, but the landlord who received me is at most middle-aged.\u00a0Chen Ge stood up to press his ear to the wall. The television on the other side of the wall was still blaring. Currently, it was playing some random commercial.Normally, wouldn\u2019t the viewer switch the channel during commercials? But they\u2019ve been watching the commercials for several minutes already.\u00a0Chen Ge tried to lean closer into the wall.\u00a0Perhaps, I\u2019ve missed something.He cleared his mind and tried to rearrange all the clues he had so far.\u00a0After I entered the room, I heard the sound of a plate shattering next door. Then, the landlord started to curse and scold the old man. It continued until the volume of the television was raised. Since the old man was incapacitated, it had to be the landlord who increased the television volume, but the question is, why?Chen Ge narrowed his eyes as a speculation appeared in his mind.\u00a0Is the landlord ill-treating the old man? The television noise is to cover up the sound of assault?The more he thought about it, the more possible it sounded in his mind.\u00a0The shattering plate occurred the moment I moved in; isn\u2019t that too much of a coincidence? Could that have been an SOS signal from the old man? After all, it was merely a broken plate; there\u2019s no reason for the landlord to get so angered. Perhaps, he was afraid that the sound might have attracted my unwanted attention!But why should he be afraid? And why would the old man call for help?Suddenly, another detail that seemed unimportant to Chen Ge earlier entered in his mind. When the landlord was scolding the old man, he let slip several foreign curses.The family that passed away were all locals, but this landlord is not from Jiujiang; he shouldn\u2019t be blood-related to the old man or his family.Normally speaking, the man wouldn\u2019t leave his assets to be taken care of by a stranger, unless\u2026 the limping man has taken over this place and is holding the old man captive! If that\u2019s really the case, either he\u2019s a caretaker who got too greedy or he\u2019s the actual murderer!Either way, it did not bode well for Chen Ge.Chen Ge\u2019s fists tightened.\u00a0That also explains why he was eavesdropping at my door earlier; he wanted to find out how much I\u2019ve learned!Chen Ge\u2019s forehead was sweaty from all the thinking. After all, he wasn\u2019t a real detective; all he had were references to plots that he had seen on television before.What should I do now? Rush directly into the room next door to whack the landlord until he faints? No, that\u2019s too rash; if my speculation is wrong, that\u2019ll land me in hot water.\u00a0With the mallet in his hand and the penknife stuck in his pocket, Chen Ge paced around the room.Give the landlord a test to confirm his identity? No, that\u2019s too risky, what if I tip my hand too soon? After all, he might have other accomplices, and I\u2019m here all alone. If I\u2019m targeted, my life will be in danger. Furthermore, I don\u2019t really have any real proof; everything is just speculation. Also, I\u2019m pretty sure the main purpose I\u2019m here is to find the murderer from four years ago, so maybe I should focus on that instead.Chen Ge was caught in a conundrum. Suddenly, the television next door was switched off, and the place became eerily quiet.What\u2019s going on?\u00a0He opened the door slightly and lowered himself to the ground. He peeked out at the door next to him. There was no light coming out from underneath the door.Sleeping at 8 pm?\u00a0Chen Ge crawled to the landlord\u2019s room door holding the mallet. In an out of body moment, he realized how suspicious he must have looked then. He turned around to make sure no one was watching him before pocketing the mallet and crawling back to his room.Then again, my speculation might not be a hundred percent accurate, if only I had a professional to help me with the analysis.\u00a0Chen Ge lay in bed and pulled out his phone. In his contact list, other than Xu Wan, he had not spoken to many of the others before.Jesus Christ, I sure am loyal.Chen Ge thought about it. Among the people that he knew, the only person who was slightly related to investigation was the young man who had fainted inside his Haunted House\u2014He San.In any case, a medical student should be better at logic and analysis than I am.\u00a0He entered the video-sharing app and realized he had about twenty private messages. He clicked open a random one and saw it was a personal message from a studio that was based on the website. The person expressed interest in having him join the team.Is this person some kind of talent scout?\u00a0Chen Ge did not have time to deal with that right then. He scrolled through the many messages to look for He San\u2019s ID and tossed the invitation out of his mind.However, several minutes later, the studio sent him another message.\u201cYou there? We\u2019ve seen your video; it has plenty of potential.\u201cWe were wondering if you would like to cooperate with us.\u201cWe can contact the top streamers of our platform on your behalf to help increase your popularity and exposure.\u201cDoing this alone is going to be very difficult; after all, most streamers on the net rely on teams and networking.\u201cThis is a very good offer, so do consider it.\u201cYou there?\u201dThe endless pop-ups annoyed Chen Ge. He was busy trying to survive a night in the apartment that housed a murderer who had killed four individuals in cold blood four years ago, and these people were busy trying to sell him their service\u203d He finally replied, \u201cAFK.\u201d\u201cYoung man, you sure are funny. Give our studio serious consideration; you don\u2019t need to do anything beyond adding our studio\u2019s logo to your videos. In return, we will provide you with better exposure to help you gain viewership.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m currently not interested in something like that.\u201d Chen Ge felt his reply was polite already; if this was someone else, they probably would have cursed the person out before blacklisting the studio.\u201cYour short video has the possibility to go viral, but you have to understand that it is just a possibility. A platform like this has an average of 1,000,000 uploads each day, and you\u2019re just one of the more lucky ones. Nowadays, people are in for fast-food entertainment; they don\u2019t have the patience to wait. Every moment, there are fresh and more exciting things to pull their attention away. If you don\u2019t carefully manage your business, your video will soon be submerged by a sea of fresh attractions.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cTalk about it later, I\u2019m currently busy with something important.\u201d Chen Ge finally found He San\u2019s ID.\u201cWhat is more important than earning money? If you are still hesitating, perhaps we can have some other form of cooperation. For example, we\u2019re more than willing to offer good money to buy your content and video-shooting technique.\u201dChen Ge was irked, so he blacklisted the individual and messaged He San.To his surprise, He San replied within a few seconds. \u201cBoss, I\u2019ve been waiting for you to release a new video!\u201d\u201cWait a minute, I have a more important question to ask you.\u201d After getting He San\u2019s phone number, he called the young man and explained the whole situation to him in a whispered tone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After he was done, on the other end of the phone, He San was stunned. This honest young man who just came to the city from the countryside to attend medical school did not expect his first conversation with an online friend to be so freaking exciting.\u201cYou\u2019re currently at that cursed apartment?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAnd the landlord next door might be the killer from several years ago?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWait a minute, this is too much for me to process at once, let me think about it first.\u201dThis created an interesting contrast between the situations on both side of the phone; one was wrapped in his warm blanket, chewing on KFC, watching some online videos, while the other was caught in a haunted apartment, heavy with gloom and anguish.\u201cBoss, I still think you should report this to the police. Granted, you don\u2019t have any actual proof, but compared to the offense of making a fake report, your life is more important.\u201dHe San was merely looking out for him, but Chen Ge had his own consideration. This Murder by Midnight was a mission given to him by the black phone. He had to stay there overnight for the mission to be a success. Interference from the police would most likely ruin his mission. Since it involved the unlocking of a new scenario, surrendering just like that felt like a great waste. \u201cIt\u2019s still not yet time to involve the police.\u201d\u201cMainly, it\u2019s your safety that you should be concerned about\u2026 Boss, how about this?\u201d He San paused before adding, \u201cTurn on your phone\u2019s GPS triangulation and try to keep your phone on throughout the night. I\u2019ll pay attention to the sounds from your side, and if there\u2019s anything weird, I\u2019ll call the police immediately.\u201dThat was not a bad idea. Chen Ge looked at his phone. He still had not exited the video-sharing app, and there was an advertisement for a Mukbang stream going on.Suddenly an idea came into Chen Ge\u2019s mind. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I open a livestream at the haunted apartment? If anything dangerous happens to me, the viewers will be able to help me alert the police, and the recording of the livestream will be the best evidence. Of course, I hope for everything to go well, and with this method, I\u2019ll be able to attract more viewers to my page and thus advertise my Haunted House.\u201dThe short video from last night had brought Chen Ge about 1,000 new followers and consequently the number of visitors at his Haunted House the next day had doubled. This was a workable method. Furthermore, the ultimate goal of him entering the haunted apartment was to earn the mission reward to improve his Haunted House. If starting a livestream was able to ensure his safety while he was conducting his mission as well as increase his popularity and viewership, then why not?\u201cEven though I don\u2019t have the budget to advertise my stuff all over the place, I can rely on livestreams and short videos to attract people\u2019s attention.\u201dWhat Chen Ge was lacking in were platform, channels, and experience; in terms of content, he was not at all worried. Even though the personnel from the studio earlier was annoying, they were right. Modern entertainment was about instant gratification. What could be more exciting and intense than an overnight stay at a haunted apartment and a possible tussle with a crazed murderer?Viewership followed content, and compared to other streamers, Chen Ge had a unique leg-up. All of his content and the stuff that he experienced was all real; there was no plot or script, and even he had no idea what might happen next. In a way, the livestream was merely a recording of him completing the mission dispensed by the black phone.\u201cHe San, I\u2019m ending the call. Come directly to my livestream, the stream\u2019s ID will be similar to the ID on my personal page.\u201dAfter hanging up, Chen Ge turned on his phone\u2019s triangulation system and set 991 as his quick dial. After everything was done, he selected the livestream option on the video-sharing app.Videos nowadays were normally only several ten seconds long, meaning they were hard to monetize. Therefore, to improve fan loyalty and more directly monetize follower numbers, most streams would livestream when they were not preparing to release a new video.Since short videos were easily shared, they could be used to attract the attention of random viewers. Then, with livestreams, those viewers could be turned into followers if the steamer\u2019s content was interesting enough. Incidentally, Chen Ge had stumbled across the most correct way of establishing one\u2019s online brand.\u201cOvernight at a haunted house! Your host, an intrepid explorer! Exposing the parts of the world that are normally hidden from sight!\u201d Chen Ge used several exclamation marks in his title to separate his livestream from others.To be honest though, he need not have done that. The livestream function attached to the video-sharing app was ultimately different from a streaming website. The categorization was limited and mostly involved talking to scantily-dressed girls. Chen Ge\u2019s livestream was like a pile of cow dung amid a bed of roses; it was incredibly hard for him to not get noticed.After opening the livestream, his fans that followed him would be notified, and similarly, there would be an announcement at his profile page.In less than few seconds, the first batch of viewers arrived.He San was the first to message. \u201cBoss, you\u2019re serious? You\u2019re really going to livestream this?\u201dDeath to all Men posted, \u201cYou\u2019re the creep who uploaded that video yesterday night? Good, because I\u2019m here to claim your life!\u201d\u201cF*ck! Sis, what happened to you? Calm down, maybe we can talk this out.\u201d\u201cCreep host, subbed,\u201d posted I\u2019m a Little Green Worm.\u201cAny subs know what the content of this stream is?\u201d\u201cDo you not know how to read? The title is right there!\u201dThe moment Chen Ge began the livestream, those who were waiting for his video showed themselves, and the viewership of his room slowly climbed.\u201cGuys, I think there\u2019s a misunderstanding.\u201d Chen Ge put his mallet away and turned to the camera seriously. \u201cThe video from last night wasn\u2019t a joke; I experienced it myself. You can go look for the full video on supernatural forums if you do not believe me. The footage has not been tempered; the thing in the mirror is real. I know that is hard to believe, but if you follow me, I\u2019ll unveil the hidden side of this world to you little by little.\u201d\u201cHello, 001, I\u2019m sorry, but what is the number for mental hospital?

In support of our friend finding a new job!\u201dSeveral notices appeared on screen, and all of them showed disbelief at Chen Ge\u2019s promise. The man wasn\u2019t fazed. \u201cI don\u2019t mind if you think I\u2019m crazy because you\u2019ll soon see how wrong you all are.\u201dThe viewership continued to climb. Chen Ge turned to look at the night sky that was darkening. He lit a cigarette and started explaining the bloody history of Fu An Apartments to his viewers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He managed to summarize the many news articles he had read and combined them with his own hypotheses, creating a believable and intriguing tale for his viewers.\u201cThat is what has happened. To search for inspiration for my Haunted House, I decided to stay overnight at this cursed apartment, but I came across a startling discovery: every single tenant of this apartment has something off about them, and I suspect that the murderer from years ago is masquerading as one of them!\u201d Chen Ge snuffed his cigarette off and turned to address the camera.\u201cInteresting, so a real life murder mystery. Anyone have a brilliant idea as to who the real killer is?\u201dI\u2019m a Little Green Worm mocked, \u201cHost, you sure know how to bullsh*t, but we\u2019re not that gullible!\u201d\u201cJiujiang City\u2019s Fu An Apartments, I just looked it up on the internet; the host doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s lying.\u201dHe San showed some support. \u201cI believe the host.\u201dHowever, I\u2019m a Little Green Worm was not easily convinced. \u201cEven if the host isn\u2019t lying about the case, how do we know that he is currently at the cursed apartment? As he said earlier, the place was burned down. But take a good look at the room he\u2019s room. The wall is clean and painted, and all the furniture looks useable albeit a little bit old; does this look like a cursed apartment to any of you?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t lie to you guys about that. You want proof? Easy.\u201d Chen Ge moved the make-up counter away and pulled his penknife. He scratched away a small corner of the paint on the wall. \u201cThe name of a building can be changed, and the place can be refurnished and repainted, but certain things cannot be removed or hidden.\u201dHe removed the freshest layer of wall paint to reveal the brickwork underneath, which was charred black. \u201cThis is evidence that this place was the crime scene of the fire.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m interested in why you would bring a mallet and a knife to stay at a hostel\u2026 for self-defense?\u201d Death to all Man raised an obvious concern.\u201cHost is ruining the wall for no reason. One minute of silence for the poor landlord.\u201d\u201cHow much did you pay for a room like this? It doesn\u2019t even have a television.\u201dLooking at the chat log, Chen Ge could not help but sigh. \u201cGuys, can you not focus on the irrelevant points? How about some respect? I\u2019m putting my life on the line to do this livestream for you!\u201dDeath to All Man donated one dollar. \u201cOne-dollar donation as sign of respect.\u201dChen Ge was helpless dealing with the online trolls, but at least they didn\u2019t leave him. \u201cFine, let\u2019s get back to business. I\u2019ve met six different individuals since I arrived at this apartment. The first person I met was a woman who might have a little mental problem; when I arrived, she smiled wickedly at me unprompted. This unhinged me slightly, but since I have had no further interaction with this woman, there\u2019s nothing else I can say\u2026\u201dChen Ge introduced all of the tenants to his viewers, and when he was done, he added his own analysis. \u201cIn terms of motive, the landlord is definitely the most suspicious, but his movement speed is hindered due to his limp. So, viewed from this perspective, the tattoo guy on first floor and the fat man on second floor have the greatest possibility of being the killer. Of course, one can\u2019t ignore the woman and the seemingly weak Wang Qi.\u201d\u201cBasically, you\u2019ve come up with nothing,\u201d Death to All Man surmised. \u201cBased on your analysis, I\u2019ve further suspicion that the real killer is the old man in the wheelchair; after all, he stood to gain the most from the fire.\u201d\u201cThat might not be that implausible. After all, the old man might be incapacitated now, but that doesn\u2019t mean that he was the same four years ago. Furthermore, the crime we\u2019re talking about is a fire; that doesn\u2019t require physical prowess, so the old man is a valid suspect.\u201d\u201cAlso, have you considered the possibility of the old man faking his disability? Oftentimes, the most unlikely one is the killer.\u201d\u201cActually, I have more suspicion toward the woman on the first floor. She smiled at the host, meaning she wanted to communicate something to the host. Host, can you still remember the curve of the woman\u2019s lips and the degree to which her mouth was open when she smiled at you? I\u2019ll help you analyze it from the perspective of psychology.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201dAs the interest of the viewers rose, so did the popularity of his livestream. Chen Ge looked at the busy chat log and sighed internally. He thought to himself,These people are hopeless. Looks like I\u2019ll have to go out to look for more clues before I can come to any conclusion.He placed his phone before him, adding, \u201cI did try to look around the building before starting the livestream. I discovered while most of the apartment\u2019s first and second floor has been fixed up, parts of the third floor have been left as they were four years ago. In a little bit, I will go up to conduct a closer examination; hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to come up with some useful clues.\u201d\u201cThe place is kept like it was four years ago? That\u2019s kinda\u2026 sick.\u201d\u201cThe ghosts of the families have been lingering because the case hasn\u2019t been solved?\u201d\u201cInvestigating a haunted apartment at night? The host sure is insane!\u201d\u201cOf course, the host is the operator of a Haunted House after all! Let me tell you, last time a bunch of us visited his Haunted House to demand reparation for his scary video, but we got our backsides handed to us instead. Two of the bravest among our group went in; one came out crying inconsolably, and the other fainted on the spot.\u201d\u201cWait, what happened to them? And what about those who are not as brave?\u201d\u201cHave you lost your mind? Do you think the rest of us entered his Haunted House after we saw what happen?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 You\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cLOL!\u201d commented He San.The chat had completely derailed, but Chen Ge didn\u2019t mind it that much. He pocketed his penknife, and with one hand holding the phone, the other holding the mallet, he walked to his room door.Learning from his previous lesson, Chen Ge squatted down to look at the shadows underneath the door and confirmed that there was no one standing on the other side, before lightly pushing the door open.After he closed and locked the door, Chen Ge yanked one of his hairs out to stick it into the keyhole. This way, if someone entered his room when he was not there, he would know because the hair would have been pushed further into the keyhole.After everything was prepared, Chen Ge walked to the stairwell.His steps were light to not activate the light. The light on his phone guiding his every step. As he climbed up the stairs, the walls on each side became noticeably darker in color, and there was an indescribable smell in the air.When he reached the third floor, Chen Ge turned on the flashlight function on his phone. He leaned against the wall and focused.When he first accidentally walked up to the third floor, he had noticed a dark shadow flash before him. The shape of the shadow had looked like a human.Be it a ghost or a man, I have to be careful.\u00a0The flashlight revealed to Chen Ge the crime scene from four years ago. Looking at the scratch marks that seemed to embed themselves into the wall, Chen Ge\u2019s grip around the mallet tightened.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euPing An Apartments had a unique architectural style. It only had one staircase, and it was on the right side of the building, giving the impression that the corridor leading to the left side was suspiciously long.As he walked down the corridor, he felt a chilliness tingle his spine. Even with his back to the wall, Chen Ge felt weirdly exposed.If the starting point of the fire was the third floor, then all this wouldn\u2019t have been preserved, so the killer probably didn\u2019t come up to the third floor at the time.Chen Ge continued down the darkened corridor. The doors on his either side had been warped by fire, exposing singed and ruined rooms.Navigating the trash that littered the floor, Chen Ge scurried into the closest room that he could get into.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was uncomfortable. Chen Ge walked into the room to take a closer look at the wooden planks that barred the windows. They looked surprisingly unworn, suggesting they were a recent addition.This is just a common guest room.\u00a0The ruined furniture had been removed, and the room was barren; there was basically nothing in sight.\u00a0Then again, years have passed. Even if there was evidence, it wouldn\u2019t have been preserved for so long.Chen Ge exited the room and continued down the darkened corridor. Most of the rooms were empty. The corridor was choked full of trash and abandoned paraphernalia, making it difficult for him to navigate.A person\u2019s trash can often reflect their lifestyle and attitude; perhaps this litter will provide the clues that I need.After setting a new goal, Chen Ge trudged through the rubbish in spite of the disgusting smell. About one hour later, he did come up with some interesting findings.Why are there toy dolls? There are no children among the people I have seen, so who do these belong to?\u00a0Chen Ge spent another hour sifting through the trash, and he ended up with four ragdolls. Submerged underneath the sea of trash, the four ragdolls would not have captured Chen Ge\u2019s attention if not for the fact he was a toy design major.The four dolls had probably been left there for quite some time already, because they were covered with dirty stains, and mold had infested certain parts. The toys were so fragile that if Chen Ge was not careful, he could easily pull out clumps of dirty wool.Chen Ge studied them closely and realized even though the dolls were all of different types, they came from the same manufacturer.Could it be that the toys were left behind by the ex-tenants of Ping An Apartments?However, Chen Ge very soon vetoed this possibility.\u00a0The low possibility of a family with children moving into a run-down apartment like this aside, even if there was one, it was unlikely for one family to own four dolls at the same time; after all, they came from the same manufacturer. Furthermore, based on the design and stylings, these were manufactured several years ago.The toy market updated constantly. Before he took over the Haunted House, Chen Ge had worked at a toy company, so he did know a thing or two about the toy market.If these weren\u2019t left behind by the new tenants, then it\u2019s possible they belonged to the original tenants of Fu An Apartments,\u00a0Chen Ge speculated.\u00a0The original owner of the apartment had two daughters, so if I\u2019m not mistaken, these should belong to them.However, if that was true, another question needed answering.\u00a0This place was almost completely ruined by the fire, so how did these four dolls survive?Is it a coincidence or\u2026 did someone purposely keep them at a place that would be safe from the fire?\u00a0Chen Ge felt like he was on the right track.\u00a0The only person who could that\u2026 is the killer themself! But why would the killer risk their life to protect these four dolls? Are these items of importance to them?The zipper on the back of the doll was all rusted, so Chen Ge tore open the fabric directly. Among the cotton, he discovered a card. It fit perfectly inside his palm. It was a love letter. The action was so cheesy that Chen Ge cringed on the person\u2019s behalf.\u00a0Sticking love letter inside a doll? Goodness, that sure is cheesy!If this was the murderer, then he was definitely a shy and reserved man. He did not have the courage to confess in person, so he gifted the girl the doll, hoping that she would discover the secret that was hidden within.Compelled by curiosity, Chen Ge tore open another two dolls. Each of them contained a card, and the content was almost similar to the first one.However, when he tore open the last doll, a chill ran down his spine.Instead of a love latter, the cotton was filled with shredded pieces of paper, and if placed together, they all read\u2014GO TO HELL!Confession of love for some reason turned into curses. What happened in between, Chen Ge had no way of telling.These should all have been left behind by the killer, so they are crucial evidence.\u00a0He picked out several paper pieces and shoved them in his pocket. As he was about to walk deeper into the house, the voice-activated light at the staircase suddenly came on!Sh*t! Someone\u2019s coming!\u00a0Desperate to escape, Chen Ge turned off the flashlight on his phone, grabbed the dolls, and ran into the guest room that was closest to him. Holding his breath, Chen Ge hid behind the door and looked out at what was happening through the crack between the door and its frame.The sound of footsteps became clearer, and the conversation between a male and a female floated up the stairs.\u201cWe have to move that thing out soon; we can\u2019t delay anymore.\u201d\u201cThe new tenant has been up to the third floor already. Thankfully, he turned back at the staircase or else he would have spotted me.\u201d\u201cI know, there have been more and more new people coming here recently; we have to deal with that thing as soon as we can.\u201d\u201cAgreed.\u201d\u201cInform everyone, and tell them to be prepared. We\u2019ll dig it out tonight and bury it up the hills.\u201dThe person was carrying an old-fashioned oil lamp, and with the light\u2019s help, Chen Ge managed to see that the two people talking were the landlord and the woman from the first floor.Why would they come up to the third floor in the middle of the night?Chen Ge pushed himself against the wall to ensure they would not see him.Not long after that, the tattoo guy and the fat man whom he had seen earlier all came up the stairs. They were all wrapped up in black clothes and carried equipment like wires, a gunny sack, and cleavers.What are they up to?The small group stood in the corridor, and it felt like they were in the middle of an argument.The fat man, who was walking at the back, had his head drooped while he groused, \u201cDo we really have to do this? If we dig it out, our fingerprints will easily get left behind; things will be incredibly hard to explain then.\u201d\u201cAnd you think it\u2019s easy to explain now?\u201d The landlord glared at the fat man. \u201cStop complaining and start moving.\u201d\u201cI think we should call the cops.\u201d The fat man stood where he was.The tattoo guy walked over to grip the man\u2019s collar, hissing into his face, \u201cHave you lost your mind? Do you want to die so badly? If we involve the police, we\u2019ll be their prime suspects! During the investigation, your hit-and-run and our illegal occupation of the old man\u2019s property will all be exposed!\u201d\u201cHoney, calm down.\u201d The woman walked over to place her hand on the tattoo guy\u2019s arm. \u201cWe\u2019re all in the same boat, so instead of turning on each other, we\u2019d better get moving.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNone of us have a clean record, and it was not easy for us to finally find ourselves a comfortable lair. If any of you dare get any other ideas, you\u2019d better watch out.\u201d The landlord tossed the iron hammer in his hands to the fat man. \u201cYou go and take the first crack.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Sweat covered the fat man\u2019s forehead immediately. His face blanched as he dragged the mallet across the floor.As he continued to observe, the more Chen Ge felt something was wrong.\u00a0What are they planning to dig up?The fat man walked to the deepest part of the staircase. He moved the trash to the side and, under the other tenants\u2019 careful scrutiny, parted the curtain that was originally hidden behind the mountain of trash.It was a fortified cement wall, and embedded inside the wall was a female body that was facing away from the group.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When he saw the body, he immediately messaged He San. \u201cCall the police now!\u201dThere was no light in the staircase, and a door stood between them and Chen Ge, so the viewers had no idea what was happening. Then again, Chen Ge had no time for them at a moment like that. He leaned closer to the crack, with nary the courage to even blink.The body is hidden inside the wall, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to dig up,\u00a0Chen Ge thought to himself. He did not dare make any sudden movement. He was in a very vulnerable position; the few tenants were only several steps away from him. They would have spotted him if they turned around to walk into the room he was hiding in.\u201cAre you playing with sand at the beach? Put some muscle into it!\u201d The landlord cursed as he walked over to the body. He laid the gunny sack open on the ground and squatted down to clear away the cement around the body. Probably afraid that they might wake up the other tenants, their movements were light and didn\u2019t make any sound.The wall was pried open, and the cement dust fell all over the place. Everyone was sweating profusely, but it was unclear whether it was a nervous sweat or sweat from the manual labor. They shared the work, but since this was the first time they had done something like this, everyone was still feeling a bit weirded out, which slowed down their progress considerably.Ten minutes later, they finally managed to extricate the body from the wall and placed it inside the gunny sack.\u201cFatty, you stay back to clean up the mess; the rest of us will take her up the hill to bury her.\u201d The landlord passed the hammer over as he gave the orders.\u201cI\u2019m coming with you!\u201d the rotund man said immediately. This whole exercise had drained him both physically and mentally; he didn\u2019t have the guts to be left all alone in the dark.\u201cWould you man up a little\u203d\u201d The landlord turned to say to the only woman of the group, \u201cThen, Juan Er, you stay back to accompany him; we\u2019ll meet up at the same place later up on the hill.\u201dThen he went down the stairs carrying the gunny sack with the tattooed man.His footsteps were alternatively heavy and light on account of his limp. When he passed the room Chen Ge was hiding in, he suddenly stopped.\u201cWhy is there so much cotton on the floor?\u201dChen Ge\u2019s heart was at his throat when he heard that question from the landlord. When he tore the dolls open, some shredded cotton and paper pieces had inadvertently fallen on the floor. At the time, it had been too dark for him to notice them, and now, it was too late for him to retrieve it.\u201cIt\u2019s probably just rubbish. We\u2019ll deal with it later, this thing is heavy; let\u2019s deal with the more important matter first,\u201d The tattooed guy who was behind him, urged. The landlord nodded, and the two continued on down the corridor and the stairs.\u201cFatty, don\u2019t just stand there, start working.\u201d The woman and the fat man worked together to pick up all the trash and wiped away the blood stains that were left on the tools. Several minutes later, they also went down the stairs hauling a hug sack.Their footsteps gradually disappeared. It was not until the third floor became totally quiet that Chen Ge dared to breathe. He was cautious as he leaned to look through the crack. The corridor was dark and empty. Everyone had left.F*ck! That scared the crap out of me.He waited for another three minutes. When he was sure they were not coming back, Chen Ge inched out from behind the door and walked out on tip-toes. To prevent discovery, he did not use his the phone. He placed his hand on the wall and slowly found his way forward.Based on their conversation, yes, those people aren\u2019t totally innocent, but the female body in the wall doesn\u2019t seem like it has anything to do with them.If anything, they were a certain kind of unlucky. After seizing the old man\u2019s property, they were left with a body in the wall to be dealt with. The first reaction for any normal individual under such circumstances would have been to call the police, but since they each had a crime they were hiding from, they could not do that. In the end, they had no choice but to help the real murderer keep this a secret, and now they even had to help the murderer bury the evidence.No wonder the landlord reminded me multiple times to not wander around the building after dark.After Chen Ge\u2019s eyes got used to the darkness, his speed increased. He could not wait to get out of the building. Chen Ge decided to give up on his backpack and directly went down to the first floor.F*ck!The front door was locked, meaning he was trapped inside the building.These people still remembered to lock the door even when they were going out to bury a body\u203d\u00a0A twinge of fear curled up within Chen Ge\u2019s heart.\u00a0The windows on the first floor are all fixed with anti-theft netting, and the ones on the third floor are all barred with wooden planks, so my only route of escape is through the windows on the second floor.The longer he stayed inside the apartment, the more anxious he felt. Chen Ge clutched the mallet in his hand as he returned to the second floor. The corridor looked ominous in the dark like the gaping maw of a monster.This is too quiet.\u00a0Chen Ge\u2019s room was next to the landlord\u2019s, which was at the deepest end of the corridor. He was tense, afraid that any of the room door would suddenly open. Holding his breath, Chen Ge slid silently down the corridor to his room.Thankfully, there were no surprises. If I tie the bedspread together, it should be long enough for me to jump out the window and reach the first floor.\u00a0Chen Ge found his key and used his phone\u2019s torch to locate the keyhole. As he was about to stick the key in, his hand froze.Where is the hair that I stuck in the keyhole?His hair stood on end and fear swamped Chen Ge on all side. His limbs were frozen solid.Someone has gone inside my room! They know I\u2019m not in my room!Chen Ge\u2019s breathing turned rapid; he felt like there was a piece of ice stuck in his lung.When did they get in? After digging up the body? Or when they saw the cotton on the floor?\u00a0In reality, the answer was not that important. Chen Ge took several steps back, and he gradually calmed down, staring at the closed door of his room.\u00a0I can\u2019t go into the room; they\u2019re probably waiting inside to ambush me!Chen Ge got used to the situation fast enough thanks to his powerful heart. He had to get out of that place as fast as he could or else he would be in mortal danger. Chen Ge did not make any noise as he took further steps back. He knew clearly, other than the windows on the second floor, there was no other exit out of the apartment.Making as little noise as he could, Chen Ge retreated to the right most corner of the corridor, this was the place was the farthest from his room.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThese tenants are far more dangerous than I expected. Whether I\u2019ll be able to survive tonight or not all depends on this gamble!\u00a0Chen Ge gritted his teeth and raised his mallet to knock heavily on the door lock of the most right-hand side room.The curious silence of Ping An Apartments was shattered. Chen Ge slammed on the lock like he was crazy. Following the loud bangs, the individuals that he had no interest of seeing at all appeared.The door to room 208, the room that Chen Ge had rented, was shoved open. The tattooed guy and the landlord rushed out of it brandishing an iron hammer and a cleaver. They dashed at Chen Ge with scary expressions!Please open!The lock finally snapped under pressure, and without hesitation, Chen Ge kicked the room door open!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s so high!\u00a0Standing at the window, the drop was at least a three to four meters. Hasty footsteps echoed louder and louder, meaning the landlord and the tattooed guy were closing in on him.Chen Ge did not have the luxury of time. He jumped out of the window, grabbing the sill by the ledge as one of his legs found purchase on the first-floor window\u2019s anti-theft steel netting.\u201cHe must have seen us move the body!\u201d\u201cWe mustn\u2019t let him get away!\u201dThe landlord\u2019s ugly mug appeared at the door. Flashing the cleaver in the air, he hissed, \u201cYou think you can escape\u203d\u201dChen Ge did not dare hesitate and let go instantly. His arms were scratched, and his clothes was torn by the netting as he slid down the wall. Chen Ge rolled as he landed to reduce the impact. As he straightened himself, he grabbed the mallet off the floor and ran toward the gate.\u201cQuick, grab him!\u201d the landlord roared as he lobbed the cleaver at Chen Ge. Chen Ge felt something fly past him. Looking at the cleaver that was stuck deep into the grass, he shivered in fear.If I fall into the hands of these people, they\u2019ll definitely kill me!The apartment\u2019s front door swung open then, and the fat man and the woman, who had been waiting on the first floor, gave chase after him, each holding hedge clippers in their hands.\u201cBunch of crazies!\u201d Chen Ge ran as fast as he could. He shot like an arrow to the gate. Stepping on the newly changed lock, he climbed up the rusted gate. The apartment building was surrounded by a rather dense forest. In the dark, with no light, he could not even see where he was going. However, with the bunch of homicidal crazies chasing after him, Chen Ge had no choice but to brave the possibility of getting lost and head into the forest.As he ran through the brush, the ray of flashlights occasionally cut through the darkness, and the cursing of the landlord and the tattooed guy came from behind him. Chen Ge did not even dare turn around; he only had one thought on his mind\u2014escape!His clothes were torn by the twigs and branches; his body was covered in mud and leaves. After fifteen minutes of full speed running, Chen Ge believed he had finally managed to outrun the landlord\u2019s group.He half-squatted inside a bush and saw the dim light that lit up some place far away. His fingers snuck into the fresh soil, and he gasped greedily for air.That was way too close!\u00a0When he was trapped inside the apartment, if he had made one wrong move, he would have died.Jesus, the difficulty of this Trial Mission is too damn high!\u00a0The mission dispensed by the black phone liked to toy with his life, and the worst thing was\u2026 this was happening to him in real life.Temporarily shaking off the landlord\u2019s group did not mean that he was safe. Chen Ge shrank into the bush, and he was still afraid that when he turned, he would suddenly see the landlord\u2019s group behind him with clippers and cleavers.When his heart rate returned to normal, Chen Ge slowly extricated himself from the bush. The sign of the flashlights had completely disappeared. The forest was quiet; even the birds were not singing.Which direction is out?\u00a0Chen Ge had to admit he was completely lost.\u00a0Should I hide in here until dawn?Chen Ge pulled out his phone and realized the livestream was still going on. The screen had been black for more than one hour already. The chat log was filled with question marks. Even the more experienced viewers had no idea what was going on inside this curious livestream.He did not waste time to explain himself. He glanced at the time and was about to click open the message that had come from He San when he suddenly heard the sound of leaves crunching coming from behind him.Chen Ge immediately stuck his phone back into his pocket, lest the light from the screen exposed him. Clutching the mallet tightly, he was so nervous that even his palms were sweating, and he stared in the direction where the sound had come from.Not long after that, a ray of dim light cut through the darkness.Just as Chen Ge was about to use his mallet, a familiar voice asked, \u201cIs someone there? Who is it?\u201dWang Qi? Didn\u2019t he leave the apartment a long ago? Why is he here at the middle of the night?\u00a0Chen Ge thought to himself. Even though Chen Ge was curious, he understood curiosity killed the cat, so he stayed where he was.Was I mistaken? Impossible\u2026\u00a0Wang Qi waved his flashlight around and paced around the area.I mustn\u2019t let him see me; this person\u2019s problem is even bigger than the tenants of Ping An Apartments.\u00a0Chen Ge did not show himself; instead, he retreated further away from Wang Qi.After moving for a while, Chen Ge realized the hill was becoming steeper. He seemed to have gone the wrong direction and wandered around to the other side of the hill.After exiting a thick bush, a secluded estate appeared before him. Surrounded by trees sat a very simple looking wooden house. There was a wooden sign tacked to the door, and as he wandered closer, he saw it read: \u2018Fire is a very dangerous thing in the forest, so be careful when using flames. Saving the environment starts with you, do not litter.\u2019This looks like a resting house for the forest rangers.\u00a0He tried pushing the door, and it was not locked. As it creaked open, a weird smell drifted out from within.What is it?\u00a0He did not dare turn on the flashlight on his phone, only using the brightness of his screen.The wooden house was small, but it was filled with various everyday items; it looked more like a landfill site.Chen Ge sniffed the air and walked toward the source of the weird smell. It was a bed. He flipped the wooden mattress up, and underneath, he saw clothes that had gone moldy.A hoarder?\u00a0The discovery was even weirder than he had predicted. All the clothes were for a female, and they appeared worn and unwashed. Chen Ge pulled several articles of clothing out and realized they were of the same size; this meant that they probably all belonged to the same person.The mud stuck to the clothes hasn\u2019t even dried yet, meaning they have been worn recently?With the Mortician\u2019s Make-up skill, Chen Ge had gained a thorough understanding of human anatomy. As he used his fingers to measure the size of the clothes, the image of the female body that was embedded in the wall appeared in his mind.The size matches perfectly; these clothes probably belonged to the woman inside the wall!But why would a dead woman\u2019s clothes be hidden inside this wooden house? And why had they been worn several days ago\u203dChen Ge\u2019s heart started to race. He placed the clothes on the floor and realized there were some paper notes stuck to some of them. He picked them up for a closer look and realized they were all filled with proclamations like \u2018I love you.\u2019This handwriting\u2026\u00a0Chen Ge pulled out the notes from the dolls. Under close examination, the two looked ninety percent similar.The dolls were from five years ago, and these female clothes were obviously dumped here only several weeks ago. There are years apart between them, so why do they share so many similarities?Same handwriting, same love notes: could the culprit for both cases have been the same person?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChen Ge picked up the clothes to throw them back under the bed. It was then that a phone with pink case fell from one of the pockets.A phone?Chen Ge picked it up. He realized that the phone was on the messages page; whoever was using the phone had been writing a message.Save me?A chill ran down Chen Ge\u2019s spine. He exited the page and looked through the message history. All of them were the same, and they only had two words\u2014Save me!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Lonelytree\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Millman97Chen Ge looked through the sent dates of all the messages, and they were all one day apart and sent at midnight. This matched perfectly with what Wang Qi said, but it was also the detail that made Chen Ge shiver in terror.How could a body frozen inside a wall send a message punctually every night?Supernatural activity? If this was truly the work of a powerful specter, how was that group of tenants, who had disturbed the body, still alive?Something is wrong.\u00a0Chen Ge lined up all the clues, and a thought dawned upon him.\u00a0The person who has been sending Wang Qi messages every night is the killer of his fianc\u00e9, as well as the real killer responsible for the arson years ago.And I think I know that person is,\u00a0Chen Ge thought, standing inside the wooden house.\u00a0Wang Qi is thought a mad person by every tenant in the apartment, and the landlord chases him out every time he sees him. But more than that, he is the only person I saw tonight who isn\u2019t a tenant at the apartment. In spite of that, he appears often enough within the vicinity of the apartment; this means that his actual place of accommodation must be very close to the apartment.But the question is, when I was arguing with the landlord about the rental, he told me confidently that there is no other place to live within several thousand meters. In other words, Wang Qi couldn\u2019t be living at another nearby apartment or hotel. In that case, this wooden house is probably where he lives when he\u2019s not out spreading those notices.If he\u2019s the resident of this wooden house, then many things can be explained. The pitiable man who wanders about every day, asking about his missing fianc\u00e9, is probably his own fianc\u00e9\u2019s killer!Chen Ge had a hard time believing that he had chatted so amiably with a cold-blooded murderer and even attempted to share his sad history with the man. His swallowed deeply, and it was then that he felt fear.\u00a0This madman must have been through some trauma to have the need to collect the dead woman\u2019s clothes and even use the woman\u2019s phone to message himself every night. Perhaps there\u2019s another personality that lives inside his body that comes out to take over his body after he falls asleep.The more he thought about it, the more uneasy Chen Ge became. He looked through the phone to try to come up with more clues.\u00a0This phone should be covered with his fingerprints, so it is an important piece of evidence; I have to take good care of it.As Chen Ge looked at the screen, perhaps it was the nervousness or perhaps it was something else, he saw a girl\u2019s figure appear on screen. She looked to be eighteen or nineteen and was wearing a blood-dyed school uniform.He rubbed his eyes to attempt to take a closer look when he felt a chill run up the back of his neck like something was brushing its hand along it; this made Chen Ge jump and turn back to look!The air in the wooden house froze, and Chen Ge\u2019s heart almost jumped out of its cage when he saw what was behind him. The door of the wooden house had been opened silently, and standing about two meters behind him was Wang Qi with his eyes bloodshot, raising an axe slowly up in the air.Time seemed to have stopped as the two men looked at each other, neither daring to move.\u201cSo close\u2026\u201d Wang Qi\u2019s voice was completely different from before; it seemed like the madness that was suppressed earlier had been unleashed. Chen Ge did not say anything in return, but his grip on the mallet tightened. He was feeling rather grateful toward the specter. If she had not shown up to warn him, his head would have been rolling on the floor.\u201cSuch a waste.\u201d Wang Qi took a step forward, and Chen Ge immediately held his mallet up in a guarded manner. \u201cRelax, you\u2019ve seen the stuff inside the phone?\u201dChen Ge did not know what the madman was up to, so he did not dare let his guard down.\u201cActually, if you think about it, I haven\u2019t really lied to you.\u201d The lethargy that Chen Ge saw earlier had completely disappeared. If anything, Wang Qi seemed to be in a very excited state. It felt like Chen Ge was dealing with a different person compared to the one he talked to that afternoon. \u201cWhen you first talked to me when you entered the apartment, I already told you my fianc\u00e9 was hidden inside the apartment, did I not? See, I haven\u2019t lied to you, have I?\u201dHe used the blunt end of the axe to pick up the clothes his fianc\u00e9 once wore. \u201cAfter all, it was me who personally sealed her up inside the wall.\u201dThen Wang Qi\u2019s tone turned; his emotions raged like he was reminded of a traumatic event. He used the axe to split the clothes in two. \u201cI did nothing wrong; she\u2019s the one who made the mistake. She wanted to leave, so what could I do but try my best to make her stay?\u201dWang Qi blocked the door with the axe swaying in his hand. As he stared at the chopped fabric, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do it; you understand, right? I didn\u2019t mean it\u2026\u201dRegardless of what Wang Qi said, it was an undeniable fact that he had murdered more than one victim, so Chen Ge paid no heed to his explanation. With the mallet in his hand, Chen Ge slipped the dead woman\u2019s phone into his pocket. He zeroed in on the door, trying to find an opening to escape.\u201cI\u2019m a hated individual; everyone around me says so. No, even if they don\u2019t vocalize it, I know that\u2019s what they think; I can feel it.\u201d Wang Qi seemed to have totally lost his mind. His mental state was fractured, and he seemed to have a habit of talking to himself. It was as if he had walked into a mental maze and could not find a way out.As Wang Qi was talking, Chen Ge slowly adjusted the angle that he was standing. He simulated different escape scenarios in his mind, like using something else to distract the madman\u2019s attention, but those ideas were removed from his mind because the wooden house was ultimately too small for something like that.Wang Qi\u2019s voice became shriller as he continued, a veritable sign that he was breaking down.The longer he stayed there, the greater the danger it was for Chen Ge. He decided to make a move soon and stopped focusing on running simulations. Every muscle in his body tensed. Wang Qi sounded like he was on the verge of lose control as the axe flailed dangerously in the air. Chen Ge caught an opening. He sprinted and knocked into Wang Qi with great momentum!One should not underestimate a cornered rabbit. This was probably the bravest decision Chen Ge had ever made in the past twenty years. When facing off against a serial killer, he acted even more rashly than the killer!In the dark, Wang Qi\u2019s reaction was one beat slower than Chen Ge\u2019s. He was unable to avoid Chen Ge\u2019s mallet, which was flying at his head.Bang!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe mallet connected with skin and skull. Chen Ge felt something sticky on his hand, but he did not relax and launched another kick at Wang Qi\u2019s stomach. When the man doubled over, Chen Ge blasted out the door!Chen Ge immediately raced into the forest. This time, he did manage to catch the direction he was running in. The trees became sparser and the ground smoother. However, he still had not escaped from danger. He knew someone was chasing after him; the wavering light and the sound of the branches being snapped was the best proof.Chen Ge did not dare to even stop to take a breather. It was not until he saw the cement road that the sound behind him slowly disappeared.\u201cThose people should have left already.\u201d Chen Ge ran several hundred meters down the cement road before he heard the sound of police siren.

The tallest among them had a tattoo of a peony on the back of his hand.\u201cYes, that\u2019s him!\u201d\u201cPeony represents wealth in Chinese culture and is a common tattoo among gamblers. This man\u2019s name is Zhang Peng; he\u2019s a gambler who is currently running from a debt of several hundred thousand RMB. He\u2019s involved in crimes like robbery and mugging.\u201d The officer continued flipping through the pictures. \u201cNow, take a look at this.\u201dThis time, it was a picture that looked like it was taken from a traffic camera. After multiple zoom-ins, Chen Ge finally got a clear view of the driver. Sitting in the driver\u2019s seat was a frantic looking fat man; he looked around ninety percent similar to the fat man Chen Ge saw in the apartment.\u201cLooks familiar.\u201d\u201cWith your description, we matched it to our traffic records database. The name of the driver in the picture is Feng Chunlei, an out-of-city man. He was responsible for a hit-and-run and driving under influence.\u201d The young officer put aside his phone and rearranged the information laid before him. \u201cI believe I\u2019ve taken all the information I need from you, Mr. Chen, but temporarily, you cannot leave. In a minute, the people from the Main City\u2019s investigation team will need to get a more thorough statement from you. Hopefully, you\u2019ll be willing to cooperate with the investigation; after all, you\u2019re our only witness.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Chen Ge leaned down in bed, and his emotions began to calm down. Several hours ago, Western Jiujiang City\u2019s police station had received a call saying there was a murder going on at Ping An Apartments. The police mobilized immediately. They ran into Chen Ge on their way to Ping An Apartments. After some initial questions, the police separated into two teams.One went to follow Chen Ge back to the wooden house to detain Wang Qi, and the other went into the forest to capture Ping An Apartments\u2019 tenants. When Chen Ge returned to the wooden house, there was only a pool of blood on the floor; Wang Qi had already disappeared.After seeing the fresh blood and the large amount of clothing in the wooden house, they finally believed Chen Ge. They immediately called for the station\u2019s help to send more people to seal the mountain.Chen Ge, as the key witness, was given airtight protection. Initially, the police wanted to send him to the station, but to complete the mission given by the black phone, Chen Ge insisted on staying. He told the police there was more evidence inside Ping An Apartments and insisted on having his statement taken at Ping An Apartments.So, with four officers, two inside and two outside the door protecting him, Chen Ge lay down in bed, waiting for the mission time to pass.The door was pushed open at 3 am. A middle-aged officer in his forties walked in. He removed his police cap and grabbed the bottle off the table to take several big gulps.\u201cUncle Sanbao, that\u2019s mine.\u201d Chen Ge sat up in bed when he saw the man. The officer\u2019s full name was Lee Sanbao, the deputy head of Western Jiujiang City\u2019s police station. Coincidentally, he was also the officer responsible for Chen Ge\u2019s parents\u2019 disappearance case. At the time, it was this Uncle Sanbao who had helped Chen Ge walk out from his depression.\u201cYou cheeky little thing, haven\u2019t I told you to not refer to me as your Uncle Sanbao? It\u2019s Superintendent Lee or Inspector Lee.\u201d Lee Sanbao put down the water bottle and scolded him with an irrepressible smile on his face. \u201cI\u2019ll let it slide this time since you\u2019ve done a wonderful good deed this time.\u201dChen Ge stood up to ask, \u201cThey\u2019ve caught the man?\u201d\u201cOf course, don\u2019t underestimate the people from the investigation team. They have not only captured Wang Qi but also the other people from the apartment. The only one missing is Zhang Peng.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great news!\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ve even found Wang Qi\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s body; it\u2019s being looked over by our forensic expert as we speak. In any case, if you have any questions, you\u2019d better ask them now because I\u2019ll need to leave to deal with other things soon.\u201d The only reason Inspector Lee was there was to give Chen Ge the good news.\u201cBoth Zhang Peng and Feng Chunlei are escaped criminals, but what about the other two?\u201d Chen Ge did not hesitate and pose the question on his mind.\u201cThe woman is Zhang Peng\u2019s wife. At most, she\u2019ll be guilty of harboring a fugitive. The landlord, though, is a bit more complicated. He was originally a care-taker but got too greedy and cooperated with the rest to seize the senior\u2019s property. However, he did not torture the senior. At least, we couldn\u2019t see any obvious wounds on the senior,\u201d Inspector Lee answered as he put his cap back on. \u201cWhy would you ask about that?\u201d\u201cJust curious.\u201d Chen Ge listened to He San and flashed an honest smile. \u201cAlthough, I hear that aiding the police in capturing fugitives entitles one to some rewards, yes?\u201d\u201cThe banner and badge will be sent to you through mail when the case is closed, goodbye.\u201d\u201cF*ck, wait!\u201dThe young officer who saw this laughed and said, \u201cInspector Lee is just playing with you. If Wang Qi is confirmed to be the arsonist from four years ago, then the reward money that you could get is about 30,000 RMB. However, the reward will be given by the local government\u2019s treasury and not the law enforcement. Furthermore, the senior once offered 5,000 RMB as reward for any information relating to his family\u2019s death.\u201d\u201cSo, there\u2019s really a monetary reward?\u201d Chen Ge\u2019s lips curved into a smile when money was mentioned. \u201cI asked only for fun. Of course, the reason I did this was not for the money. To be able to contribute to the preservation of peace within this wonderful city of ours is the absolute honor.\u201dThe young officer smiled and did not comment. He went back to his post of guarding the door.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLater, after Chen Ge was questioned by the investigation team, the officers volunteered to send him home. However, to complete the mission, Chen Ge gave multiple excuses. He refused to budge from the apartment building. Either he needed to get his stuff from Room 408 or he wanted to follow the officer up to the third floor to see the crime scene for himself. In any case, he stayed there until 6 am. It was not until the Mission Completed notice appeared on the black phone that he was willing to leave in the police car.Looking at the scenery that flew past him, Chen Ge did not feel at all tired. He snuck out the black phone quietly and started to look through the mission reward.\u201cPlayer managed to reach the Mission Location on time, successfully found the party responsible for the murder, and survived until dawn.

Is the black phone mistaken or something? This feels more like a curse than a reward!After he finished reading the description, a new question popped up in his mind.\u00a0Although\u2026 what are these Malice Points?Based on the wording, it seemed to refer to the quantification of Wang Qi\u2019s malice.A living human being has no use for something like this, so does it mean that it\u2019s not meant to be used by a living individual?Chen Ge turned to look at the shadow trailing behind him and shook his head to loosen the thought from his mind.The police car arrived at New Century Park at around 7 am. Chen Ge asked the guard for the spare key to the Haunted House. He was so exhausted after such an eventful night. When he reached the staff breakroom, he felt like his whole skeleton was about to shatter.He pulled out his phone and realized it had already died. The livestream, naturally, had already ended. He connected it to the charger and switched it on.The pedometer that came with his phone stated that he had ran for upwards of ten thousand steps that night. He was currently at the top of his friend list, and Xiao Wan even liked this particular achievement of his.Looks like I need to find some time to go training. As long as I can run faster than others, everything should be fine.Chen Ge tapped through his phone to look for He San\u2019s number. He sent a message in case his call woke up He San, who might have been sleeping. However, the young man called less than three seconds after the message was sent.\u201cMy word! Boss, you\u2019re still alive\u203d\u201d He San\u2019s voice was so loud that Chen Ge felt a headache coming.\u201cDid you wish for me to die so badly? Also, be a little bit quieter or you\u2019re going to wake your roommates.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s sleeping\u203d We were all watching your livestream, and we\u2019ve been waiting to hear from you!\u201dHonestly, Chen Ge was quite touched when he heard this. He was about to ask He San to thank his friends for the support when he heard He San say, \u201cAfter the livestream cut off, they all said you\u2019re definitely dead and insisted on betting on it. Thank you, Boss, you\u2019ve helped pay for my meals for the rest of the week.\u201d\u201cSo ,my life is just worth several meals. Actually, you don\u2019t need to share this joy with me, really\u2026\u201d Chen Ge was speechless facing this overly honest young man.\u201cIn any case, Boss, thank God you\u2019re still alive! I was so afraid to see you end up in our labs. Did you know on our course the lecturer will snap the picture of the victim at his time of death so that we\u2019ll have a better idea of what a fresh corpse looks like\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s more than enough information.\u201d Chen Ge rubbed his temple and could feel his brain throbbing. \u201cOne of major reasons I managed to survive is thanks to you, so if there\u2019s a chance, I\u2019ll also treat you to a meal.\u201dAfter hanging up, Chen Ge clicked open his personal page on the video-sharing app and was surprised to discover his follower number had increased by more than 3,000 people.Damn! Even a black screen can get me followers?\u00a0He turned to look at his private message inbox. It was bursting with messages, but the majority of them were asking, \u201cHost, are you still alive?\u201dThese people, it seems like they couldn\u2019t wait for me to die!When Chen Ge realized the advertisement for his Haunted House was still there, and his livestream room and personal account page had not been blocked, he sighed in relief. He tossed the phone to the side, buried his face in the pillow, and stretched lazily in bed.It\u2019s time to power down. I believe I deserve a day off, time for bed.After removing his clothes and closing his eyes, Chen Ge soon fell asleep.The sun rose, announcing the arrival of a new day. Sunlight filtered into the room, gilding the edge of the bed in gold.Bang!The gate of the Haunted House was thrown open, and rushed footsteps came up the stairs. A key was pushed into the lock, and the staff breakroom was rudely pushed open.The bed shook violently like there was an earthquake!Chen Ge was so spooked that he sprung up in bed. Before he could say anything, he saw something wave before his eyes, and then a shrill and excited voice entered his ears.\u201cBoss, you\u2019re on television!\u201dTwo seconds later, Chen Ge finally returned to reality. Looking at Xiao Wan, who sat beside his pillow, and smelling the fresh scent that drifted from her hair, Chen Ge silently picked up the comforter to cover his exposed upper body before saying, \u201cSlow down, what about me?\u201d\u201cThis is the first time someone I know in real life has been on television! Even though your face has been mosaicked, I could still recognize that it was you easily!\u201d\u201cMosaic?\u201d Chen Ge still had not caught up to what Xu Wan was saying.\u201cLook.\u201d Xu Wan passed her phone to Chen Ge. \u201cThis is a snippet of the video I took from the internet. During the Jiujiang Morning News segment, there was a last-minute story.\u201dChen Ge clicked play, and the image on the screen showed Ping An Apartments.\u201cJustice always prevails! There has been a recent development to the arson that killed a family of four at Fu An Apartments four years ago. Thanks to the aid of a kind citizen, law enforcement has managed to detain the real culprit to answer for his crimes!\u201dFollowing that was a simple interview attached with a picture of Chen Ge leaving the scene with a police officer. However, Chen Ge\u2019s face was heavily pixelated. There was a caption explaining that because one of the fugitives was still on the run, the identity of the kind citizen temporarily would not be revealed to protect said citizen\u2019s safety.\u201cBoss, that person is you, right? The clothes are the same as the ones you were wearing yesterday!\u201d\u201cDo you mind letting me put on some clothes first?\u201d Chen Ge shook his head slightly. After getting into his clothes, Chen Ge quickly explained everything that had happened at Ping An Apartments last night to Xu Wan. However, he did not reveal the real reason he was there; instead, he said that he was there to seek new inspiration to add to the Haunted House.After listening to his story, Xu Wan\u2019s expression had a huge change. \u201cBoss, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re tired then. Please take your much-needed rest, leave the visitors to me.\u201dShe said that out of kindness, but the moment Chen Ge heard that there were visitors, he felt instantly energized. \u201cHow many are there?\u201d\u201cMore than yesterday.\u201d\u201cThen, what are we waiting for? Help me get up!\u201dChen Ge had Xu Wan go wait at the entrance, and he rushed to the toilet to wash his face. Then, he pulled out the black phone to click open the Murder by Midnight scenario.\u201cMurder by Midnight (Scream Factor 1 Star): This scenario has been completed. Feel free to go up to the third floor to take a look.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWarning: The Haunted House is running out of internal space. New scenarios shall not be unlockable until further expansion!\u201dChen Ge initially thought he had to prepare many things, but he realized he had underestimated the black phone.\u00a0When was the scenario set up?After putting on his shoes, Chen Ge raced up to the third floor and pushed the door open. The world beyond the door had completely changed.The space stuffed with unwanted props had disappeared, and what awaited him was a long corridor that was dripping with an eerie air. The newly unlocked scenario was huge; it took up more than half of the third floor as well as parts of space from the second floor\u2019s Minghun and the first floor\u2019s Night of the Living Dead.So, there are now three floors in total. First and second being the appetizer, and the scariest on the third. How come it became so similar to Ping An Apartments?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Lonelytree\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Millman97Chen Ge went in to familiarize himself with the new set. The structure and layout were similar to Ping An Apartments; the place was living and breathing anxiety and pain. There were more than ten traps, and many rooms were connected to each other through hidden doors. Other than that, there were a few nasty hidden gems.This place feels authentic, and it\u2019s perfect for an escape the room type of game; I\u2019ll have the visitors try it out in a minute.Standing there, the memories from last night reappeared in Chen Ge\u2019s mind, and he shivered. He had the most authentic of experience. Due to the limitation of time, Chen Ge only took a cursory look-around before walking downstairs; after all, the customers were waiting.Before he even reached the front door, Chen Ge could hear Xu Wan. \u201cPlease be patient, I\u2019m sure Boss is coming. In the meantime, you can give the other attractions at the park a try.\u201d\u201cGal, is your boss really inside the Haunted House? We saw his livestream last night; he was being chased by more than ten people through the woods! Did he really manage to escape such a dreadful situation?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re kidding\u203d I was also one of the viewers; the host was trapped inside the apartment by a bunch of crazies, and they were closing in on him. I really find it hard to believe that he would be able to escape a trap like that.\u201d\u201cAre you sure we were watching the same livestream? Last night, other than sounds, there was only a black screen, how the hell did all of you manage to come up with so much information?\u201d\u201cRegardless, we\u2019re here to see him; if not his living self, his dead body will suffice!\u201dThe sound of discussion had gotten so loud that it attracted the attention of Uncle Xu. Looking at the size of the crowd, he was feeling both glad and worried. Since a particular point in time, this Haunted House that felt like it was crumbling suddenly became New Century Park\u2019s main attraction. Many people would start lining up early in the morning.Normally, that was definitely good news, but whenever he listened to the words that came out of the visitors\u2019 lips, his heart crunched with worry.\u00a0This cannot be allowed to continue. When I see Xiao Chen next, I\u2019ll need to have a talk with him. The young man is definitely hardworking, but I must not let him stray down the dark path!The gate swung open, and Chen Ge walked out from the Haunted House. \u201cSorry for making all of you wait. The Haunted House is now open. Ticket price is 20 RMB; children are not allowed.\u201dThe crowd became silent instantly. A few of his viewers rushed over to his side to bombard him with questions about last night. Chen Ge got his five minutes of fame. After that, order returned to the crowd, and they entered the Haunted House one after another.After the lesson from the previous time, Chen Ge did not dare put Black Friday on loop. Instead, he shuffled it into a long list of sound effects, allowing it to play at random. Chen Ge helped Xiao Wan with her make-up and had her stalk the people in the Minghun scenario while he stayed at the entrance to sell tickets.The number of visitors is slowly climbing, and the reputation has increased a lot. If this continues, I\u2019ll reach the criteria to expand the Haunted House in a few days.Chen Ge took out the black phone to see how far he was from the target number of visitors he needed to unlock the expansion as well as to take a look at the refreshed daily mission.Easy Mission: If you want to provide the visitors a scary experience, then first you have to pay notice to the rhythm and tempo of their experience in the Haunted House. Setting off the scare too early might cause the visitors to lose their interest, so it is suggested that you install some sound detectors or surveillance cameras in the Haunted House to keep track of your visitors\u2019 progress.Normal Mission: The key to a good scare is the element of surprise. For example, put up the scary source opposite from the spot that normally captures the visitors\u2019 eyes. Inspect the Haunted House to see whether all the props fit this criterion.Nightmare Mission: There are weird sounds coming from the bathroom every midnight. If you want to know why, follow my directions.Daily Missions will refresh every day at midnight. User can only apply for one mission each day, and the reward corresponds to the difficulty of the mission.(Beware! The more difficult the mission, the more dangerous it\u2019ll be, so please choose carefully!)After taking a quick glance at the Daily Missions, Chen Ge first rejected the Nightmare Mission. After two sleepless nights, what he needed more than anything was rest. Furthermore, he already had one Mirror Monster to deal with; he really did not think he could deal with two monsters at the same time.The rewards from Nightmare Missions are most applicable directly to myself, giving me some kind of skill, but the reward is proportional to the risk, so temporarily, that\u2019s ruled out. The Easy Mission requires a certain amount of money; at least until the monetary reward from capturing Wang Qi arrives, completing that sounds impossible.Chen Ge considered the options and came to the conclusion that the Normal Mission was the one best available.\u00a0Setting up the scares opposite from the focal point, this is not such a bad idea. Applying it into my Haunted House will definitely bring more \u2018surprises\u2019 to the visitors.After accepting the Normal Mission, Chen Ge leaned against the entrance as he kept up the channel of communication with Xu Wan.Noon arrived soon after, and the crowd gradually dissipated. Chen Ge called for Xu Wan to come out and told her to go for her lunch break as he went back to the Minghun set alone. He had personally designed this scenario and had put much thought into each scare. Since he had accepted the Normal Mission, he spent the whole afternoon while Xu Wan was away on updating and improving the set.Normally, when the visitors entered the Haunted House, they would be mentally prepared, so it would not be easy to scare them then. Therefore, he needed something to distract their attention to make them think that something was about to jump out at them from that direction. While their attention was fully occupied by the fake scare, the real scare would assault them from a completely unexpected direction.This Normal Mission was far easier than Chen Ge expected. In just a few hours, he received the alert on the black phone that he had finished the mission.\u201cYou\u2019ve completed the Normal Mission. There is more than one way to scare a person; the element of surprise is the key to a good scare. Congratulations, you have gained the mission reward\u2014Doctor Skull-Cracker\u2019s Uniform!\u201cDoctor Skull-Cracker\u2019s Uniform (Item- Attire): Clark has worked at the mental hospital for over twenty years.

All in the name of saving his patients!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter Black Friday, Chen Ge had received another item. He clicked on the app, and the black phone told him the item had been placed inside the props room.The timing is just perfect. If I combine this with the Murder by Midnight scenario, it should create a wonderful arrangement.Several ideas cropped up in Chen Ge\u2019s mind. He grabbed a pen and paper to write them down when his phone rang.\u201cHe San?\u201d Chen Ge answered the call. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cBoss, do you still remember what I told you last time?\u201d He San kept his voice lowered, as if afraid that someone might hear him. \u201cAbout how the seniors in our faculty have formed a warring party to take revenge for Senior Gao Ru Xue after you scared her to her tears last time\u203d They\u2019re already on their way!

I hope you won\u2019t be angry; after all, our course only has five classes and, in total, only seven girls. The one you made cried was the prettiest of them all, so Boss, take care!\u201d He San heard coming footsteps, so he quickly hung up.Want to shoot a funny video at my Haunted House?\u00a0Chen Ge put his phone away, and a wicked grin appeared on his face.\u00a0They say medical students have bigger guts than most. They\u2019ll be the perfect guinea pigs to try out my new scenario, and we\u2019ll see who\u2019s laughing then.After lunch break, Chen Ge went downstairs to open the gate. The visitors who missed the chance to visit the Haunted House in the morning all rushed over. Some of them purposely came to pay the place a visit after watching Chen Ge\u2019s videos and livestream online, some of them were dragged there by families or friends, while the rest were merely curious. Since the line for this attraction was so long, it had to be for something fun, right?\u201cTicket price is 20 RMB. For the best effect, we suggest going in with a group of three.\u201d Chen Ge maintained the order as he communicated with Xu Wan. Both of them were busy beyond belief. Time flew, and when it was 3 pm, seven fashionable youths entered the New Century Park. They made a beeline for the Haunted House like they were on a mission.Each of them had different personality, and they did not talk much among themselves. They stood in the line for the Haunted House quietly, making the atmosphere become weirdly serious. Several minutes later, when the earlier group of visitors came out holding each other for support, the tallest among them walked toward Chen Ge.\u201cBoss, six tickets.\u201d His voice was deep and gravelly.Chen Ge raised his head to look at the young man and glanced at the group behind him. \u201cBut there are seven of you.\u201d\u201cThis one is just responsible for bringing us here.\u201d The tall youth yanked He San to the front.\u201cBoss, I won\u2019t be going in.\u201d He San was traumatized by his earlier experience in the Haunted House. After smiling at Chen Ge, he hurriedly squirreled back to the crowd.\u201cSince you\u2019re already here, how can I leave you all alone standing outside? Here, this is on the house.\u201d Chen Ge passed the tall youth seven tickets. \u201cAll of you are from Jiujiang Medical University, right? Nice to make your acquaintance.\u201dChen Ge\u2019s kindness and enthusiasm made the few medical students feel rather embarrassed.\u201cHe San, since the boss has gifted you the ticket, it\u2019ll be wrong if you refuse his kindness.\u201d The tall youth passed everyone their ticket, but what they did next confused the other visitors. They did not enter the Haunted House directly and seemed to congregate outside it for some kind of tactical meeting.\u201cHe San and myself will be a group; Monkey and Lao Zhao will be a group; Lao Song, Xiao Hui, and Shi Ling, you three will be the last group. Everyone has memorized the tactics that were posted on the forum before we departed, right?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s all memorized.\u201d\u201cThe layout of the set has been drawn out by He San already, and we\u2019re familiar with every trick the place has to offer.

Jiujiang Medical University, Speaker of the Living and the Dead!\u201d\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go!\u201dThe speech was so inspiring that even the other visitors could not help but clap and cheer. Even Chen Ge was internally impressed.He San and the tall youth departed from the group and said, \u201cThe two of us will lead the way, wait for our good news.\u201dThe two stepped toward Chen Ge with fire and spirit.\u201cJust the two of you?\u201d\u201cYour rules only allow a maximum of three people in one group, don\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s the rule for the Minghun scenario. Don\u2019t mind that little detail, all seven of you can come in all at once; I wouldn\u2019t want the rest of you to waste your time waiting for others.\u201d Chen Ge led the group into the Haunted House that felt like it was colder than the temperature outside. \u201cFirst, all of you need to sign the disclaimer agreement on the table, waiving away your right to sue the Haunted House for any and all injuries, supposed or otherwise, before I can allow you to continue.\u201d\u201cWait, this wasn\u2019t here last time.\u201d He San wandered over to the table.\u201cThat\u2019s because you were my first customer to faint inside the attraction.\u201d Chen Ge smiled kindly at the group of students. \u201cI believe He San will have already briefed all of you on the history of this place, so I won\u2019t go into the details. All I want to give you is just a reminder and warning.\u201dChen Ge slowly pulled his smile away. He pulled out his phone to search for the morning news. \u201cThe case at Ping An Apartments four years ago was finally solved, but there is still a killer on the loose. Of course, this has nothing to do with us, but when I came to work this morning, the door of the Haunted House was left open like someone had wandered in. Ping An Apartments and New Century Park are both on the western side of town; hopefully, it\u2019s just me overthinking.\u201dIn a few words, Chen Ge managed to plant the seed of doubt. He did not need to convince He San\u2019s group that was the truth; he merely needed to implant the suggestion in their mind. After all, one\u2019s imagination could always conjure up things that were scarier than reality.After signing the agreement, Chen Ge led them up to the third floor and slowly pushed the door to the Murder by Midnight scenario open.A cold draft picked up from somewhere. Along the dark corridors, it felt like eyes were peeping at them from the half-open doors. The corridor led down to an endless staircase, and maze-like turns and corners. The ceiling was charred, and everywhere they turned, they could see scratches, like someone had desperately tried clawing their way out.The fire of the group was half stifled the moment they saw this. Every single one of them froze on the spot, and they turned to look at He San in unison.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhere\u2019s the Siheyuan?\u201d\u201cThis is different from what you told us.\u201d\u201cI was training with weights the whole night to lift the coffin lid.\u201dThe eyes on He San almost made him cry. The honest young man could only turn to Chen Ge for help, but the latter ignored him. \u201cThe theme of this scenario is called Murder by Midnight. Please do not take any pictures, and violators will be personally responsible for the possible consequences. The exit is hidden within the set, and the time limit is twenty minutes. If you wish to surrender, just yell at the camera, and I will come get you.\u201dAfter all of them entered the corridor, Chen Ge smiled at them and said in parting, \u201cEnjoy.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The visitors are already inside the building, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Xu Wan, with her dead person make-up and the ghost bride\u2019s attire from the Minghun setting, was quite scary running about the building.\u201cI\u2019ve built a new scenario on the third floor; it\u2019s called Murder by Midnight. The group of medical students should be the perfect test subjects for the new scenario.\u201d Chen Ge pushed open the door and used the black phone to search for the things that he needed.\u201cBut shouldn\u2019t the new scenario be inspected by the park management first before it can be used?\u201d Xu Wan followed after him, holding the traditional skirt above her ankles lest she tripped on it. \u201cBoss, what are you looking for anyway?\u201d\u201cThe uniform that I personally made for you.\u201d\u201cUniform?\u201dAt the deepest corner of the room, Chen Ge spotted a familiar wooden box. He did not expect this box that had once housed the doll and the black phone would suddenly materialize in the room. Chen Ge walked to the box and peered in. Sitting at the bottom were a weird-looking hammer, a blood-soaked robe, and a yellowed missing person notice.\u201cFound it.\u201d Chen Ge pulled the robe up. Surprisingly, the robe that looked like a normal doctor\u2019s garb was incredibly heavy. That was probably due to the iron chains that were sewn into the fabric. The chains were carved with human faces in various degrees of torment.\u201cBoss, this is the uniform you made for me?\u201d Xu Wan involuntarily took several steps back because she could smell the blood that seemed to radiate from the outfit. \u201cCan I not wear it?\u201d\u201cExtras at Haunted House are actors, Xiao Wan. Think of the lessons your teachers at drama school once taught you. An actor has to be able to familiarize themself with any and all roles.\u201d Chen Ge spread the robe out, and a faux-human skin mask fell out from between the folds. Chen Ge also did not know such a thing came with the outfit. He bent over to pick it up, and with just a quick glance, he shivered with chills.The mask was made from parts of male faces sewn together. It was rough-looking, but that only added to its scare factor.\u201cBoss, don\u2019t tell me I have to wear that as well.\u201d Xu Wan had already retreated to the door.\u201cJust try it on, please. I want to see how it looks as a whole. I\u2019ll be the ghost next time, okay? Pretty please\u2026\u201d Chen Ge begged, but his tone sounded like the devil in fairy tales luring common man to sin.\u201cFine\u2026 I\u2019ll try it on.\u201d Xu Wan finally relented. After accepting the skin mask and the garb, she took off the ghost bride attire in front of Chen Ge and changed into her new uniform. She did not seem to mind that Chen Ge was standing right there. \u201cBoss, honestly, your definition of uniform might need to be updated.\u201dThe moment Xu Wan curled the chains around her body and put on the blood-soaked garb and the skin mask, a subtle change seemed to occur to her entire personality. A sense of cruelty, madness, and wickedness seemed to come over her.\u201cNot bad.\u201d Chen Ge did not dare let Xu Wan near the mirror, afraid that she might scare herself. \u201cCome, carry this with you.\u201dChen Ge grabbed the weird-looking hammer from the box. The hammer was about forty centimeters long. Its handle looked like a human spine. At the end, there was a hook that could connect it to the chain inside the robe, and on both sides of the hammer head, there were needles used for bloodletting. \u201cIt\u2019s hollow so not heavy, but if you feel it\u2019s too troublesome to run with it, you can drag it across the floor.\u201dXu Wan had already surrendered to Chen Ge\u2019s weird ideas. All she did was nod and accepted the hammer.\u201cPlace your phone inside your outer pocket and make sure your earpiece is working. Keep the channel open, and if there are no questions, it\u2019s time for us to start.\u201d\u201cUs? Boss, you\u2019re entering the scenario as well?\u201d Xu Wan turned to glance at Chen Ge. Her mellifluous voice coming out of the skin mask had a particularly chilling effect.\u201cOf course. Come on, let\u2019s get a move on. The visitors are probably bored waiting for us.\u201dChen Ge had Xu Wan enter the Murder by Midnight scenario while he returned to the main control room. In just several minutes, he found the shadows of the seven students on screen. Those seven were bigger cowards than Gao Ru Xue. Judging from the expressions on their faces, it was clear that they were nervous.After so long, they\u2019re still wandering around the entrance? Looks like I\u2019ll need to give them a little push.Chen Ge first switched the music to Black Friday before calling Xu Wan.\u201cXiao Wan, this new scenario is huge; it not only involves the third floor but also parts of the first and second floor. There are staircases at the left and right end of the scenario, so don\u2019t wonder about aimlessly or you\u2019ll get lost. Now, listen to my orders carefully.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dAfter ending communication with Xu Wan, Chen Ge applied some make-up to himself before entering the Murder by Midnight scenario through the workers\u2019 passageway. With the black phone, he could control the more than ten props and traps around the set freely. With this little convenience alone, the playability of Murder by Midnight was far greater than Minghun and Night of the Living Dead.In the darkened floor, the bathtub in one of the rooms was pushed aside. After Chen Ge crawled out from it, he returned everything back to its original state.\u201cXiao Wan, they\u2019re probably around Room 207. You go standby at the left staircase and await my next order.\u201d After that, Chen Ge let his eyes get used to the darkness before he used the right staircase to get up to the third floor.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe group of medical students still had no idea that \u2018danger\u2019 was approaching. They were still looking through the random props carefully, hoping to discover some useful clues.\u201cOther than the general dimness and low temperature, this Haunted House doesn\u2019t seem that scary, are we acting a bit too cautiously?\u201d Monkey was the smallest and chattiest of the group. \u201cBrother Feng, I think we should split into two groups. That way, the search will go much faster. The progress will be too slow if we continue to stick together like this.\u201dThe tall youth was the Brother Feng whom Monkey referred to. After realizing all of their preparation had been nothing but a waste after entering the Murder by Midnight scenario, he was admittedly a bit unsettled. However, as time passed, he slowly realized the place was not as scary as he imagined. \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea. Alright then, Monkey and Lao Song, the two of you take the two girls with you as you look through the rooms on the left; the three of us will search the rooms on the right.\u201d\u201cWe should have done that a long time ago. I don\u2019t understand what are you guys acting so scared for! This place is like a park compared to our school\u2019s morgue.\u201d The one who spoke up was a girl, one of the few who had her hair dyed among the group. Different from Gao Ru Xue, she had a little make-up on her face, and she looked more like an adult than a student.\u201cSister Hui, Brother Feng, we mustn\u2019t let our guard down; I still think we should stick together.\u201d He San hid among the crowd with a perpetual pout. \u201cThe boss of this Haunted House cannot be understood with normal logic. None of you have seen his livestream, but he\u2019s a madman with absolutely no regard for his life!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They all believed that He San was exaggerating to hide his cowardice. After all, seeing is believing. They had been inside the Haunted House for a few minutes already, and there was nothing particularly scary about the place\u2026 yet.\u201cXiao San, if you\u2019re that afraid, you can hide behind your big sister.\u201d The girl called Sister Hui took the frontline and walked into the room next to them alone. \u201cAll the decor is the same; staying in bed watching crime drama would have been more interesting.\u201d\u201cThen, we\u2019ll separate according to the grouping mentioned earlier.\u201d Monkey chased after Sister Hui adding, \u201cLet\u2019s find that exit soon, I\u2019m getting bored.\u201dLao Song and a quiet girl by the name of Shi Ling also made to follow, leaving He San, Brother Feng, and Lao Zhao in the corridor.\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m quite disappointed.\u201d Lao Zhao was a rotund fellow with skin that was fairer than most girls\u2019. He was physically unhealthy to the point where he would start to sweat after taking few steps.\u201cSave your breath, and let\u2019s start moving.\u201d With a wave, Brother Feng moved forward with Lao Zhao following behind.He San was soon left all alone in the corridor. He was the only one who maintained a state of high alert.\u00a0Something bad is bound to happen.After taking two steps, he stopped.\u00a0Wait, the background music seems to have changed, but why does it sound so familiar?Before he could focus on the sound, a crisp sound entered his ears. He tried to focus on it, but it quickly disappeared. The source of the sound seemed to come from further down the corridor.Someone is chasing after us?\u00a0He San did not dare stay to find out and hurried to catch up to his seniors. Black Friday marked the real beginning of the Murder by Midnight scenario. The light in the space dimmed, the stuff that littered the corridors started to move on its own, and the sound of clinking chains came up from the staircases.\u201cI\u2019ve found something!\u201d Sister Hui, who was in front, walked out of a room with a ragdoll in her hand. \u201cLook at this, this doll was sitting right in the middle of the room.\u201d\u201cSenior, please don\u2019t randomly move the stuff in the Haunted House. Last time, the trap was activated after we moved the coffin.\u201d He San was relaying his experience, but no one paid him any attention. Ignored by all, he could only stand quietly at the outermost circle of the group, watching his senior walk down the figurative and literal dark path.\u201cThere has to be something important about this doll. Could it be some kind of clue that it was sitting in the middle of the room?\u201d Monkey held the doll up to the dim light. The doll looked like a little girl about five or six years old. She had no eyes, and her body was burnt. \u201cNo eyes should represent darkness, and the burnt body represents the fire of hell?\u201d\u201cOr could it be murder by arson?\u201d Brother Feng pressed the doll with his hand. \u201cThere\u2019s something other than cotton inside; it\u2019s something solid. Open it and see.\u201dMonkey pulled down the zipper that was on the back of the doll. The doll was filled with shredded paper. He took out a random piece and the handwriting was scrawled and difficult to read, not unlike the handwriting of a child.\u201cWhat does it say?\u201dMonkey, who was the only one who had read the paper, had his face overcast with gloom. He placed the paper in his palm and showed it to the group; there were only six words on it\u2014All of you have to die!\u201cAll the pieces say the same thing.\u201d\u201cHow deep is the hatred to do something like this?\u201d\u201cQuickly put it back, it\u2019s making me uncomfortable.\u201d Shi Ling, who had been quiet, seemed to be creeped out by the doll. She merely glanced at it before retreating several steps back.\u201cIt\u2019s just a doll, nothing to be afraid of, probably just a decoration used by the Haunted House.\u201d Monkey pushed the paper back into the doll\u2019s body and flung the doll to the side, allowing it to fall to a random corner of the corridor. \u201cLet\u2019s move onto the next room.\u201dHowever, the quiver in his voice betrayed the anxiety that he was feeling within.\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Xiao Hui raised her left hand, which was holding a crumpled piece of paper. \u201cOther than the doll, I also found this in the room earlier. Take a look, I believe it\u2019s a diary entry of some sort.\u201d\u201cLet me see.\u201d Lao Zhao grabbed the piece of paper and started to read. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s another person hiding in the house. I wonder if he is hiding under the bed or inside the cupboard. I\u2019ve told this to Mommy, Daddy, and my big sister, but they were too concerned with some other thing to pay me any attention. When the night fell, Daddy inspected all the doors and windows to make sure they were all locked before going to bed. I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re so afraid of the things outside when there\u2019s a person hiding inside the house.\u201d\u201cF*ck! What is this?\u201d Lao Zhao stopped reading halfway and shoved the paper back to Xiao Hui. \u201cThis is all designed to disturb us; we mustn\u2019t fall for the trap.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m impressed by the attention to detail, but alas, that won\u2019t be enough to scare me.\u201d Xiao Hui placed the paper back where she found it before the group moved on to the next room. None of them realized the doll that they dropped on the floor suddenly twitched.\u201cLet\u2019s stop wasting time and find the exit.\u201d After searching five rooms, they came up with nothing and ended at the right most end of the corridor.\u201cThis floor is huge; there wouldn\u2019t be enough time for us to finish searching it within the time limit, so I feel like the chances of the exit being on the third floor are slim. If I were the Haunted House proprietor, I wouldn\u2019t have set up the entrance and the exit on the same floor,\u201d Brother Feng analyzed logically.\u201cAre we going to split into groups again?\u201d\u201cNo! If we\u2019re not on the same floor, it\u2019ll just make it easier for us to be divided and conquered!\u201d He San added, but the group decided in unison to ignore him.\u201cWe\u2019ve been in here for more than ten minutes already, but nothing has happened. Yes, the atmosphere is not bad, but it\u2019s still far from being scary. I agree to separate into groups.\u201d Lao Zhao wiped the sweat from his forehead before continuing. \u201cDon\u2019t forget our real purpose here. We have to leave the exit within the designated time to gain back the face that our university has lost!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right! We\u2019ll split up according to the original plan.\u201dJust as the discussion was about to be concluded, He San finally stepped forth to say, \u201cWill you guys please listen to me\u203d\u201dHe walked to the middle of the group and pointed down the corridor. \u201cStarting from a few minutes ago, I\u2019ve been hearing some weird sound coming from the staircase; something is following behind us!\u201dWith this reminder from He San, the group did start to notice the sound of the chains that was getting clearer and clearer.\u201cThe boss already said this scenario is called Murder by Midnight, so in that case, there has to be a murderer.\u201d Lao Zhao patted He San on his shoulder, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t overthink it. The murderer has to be a character portrayed by the Haunted House worker, and since it\u2019s only an actor, what is there to be afraid of? Am I right?\u201dThe group laughed, thinking He San was being overly sensitive.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, your seniors are here to protect you, don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d Lao Zhao pulled out his phone, adding, \u201cBy the way, didn\u2019t we decide to shoot a short video inside the Haunted House and post it on the boss\u2019 account page to make fun of him? I feel like this location is not bad. Everyone, remember to look at the camera.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe tilted the camera around to look for an angle that could capture everyone.

Have you lost your mind?\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing? You scared me!\u201dLao Zhao did not speak.

The light in the Murder by Midnight scenario was exceptionally weak. The group looked at each other, their bodies frozen.\u201cWhere\u2019s the eighth person?\u201d\u201cStop panicking!\u201d Brother Feng ordered as he pulled out his phone. As he was about to turn it on, the sound of chains from the other end of the corridor suddenly turned rapid.\u201cSomeone is coming!\u201dAs Brother Feng unlocked his phone, a bloodied monster turned the corner. The timing was perfect as if the monster already knew where they were.\u201cWhat is that\u203d\u201dUnderneath the blood-soaked doctor\u2019s coat were chains that dragged themselves across the floor. The monster\u2019s head was lowered, and the hammer in \u2018his\u2019 hand was dripping with blood. Everyone started to worry, and only Brother Feng managed to keep his cool. Ignoring Chen Ge\u2019s earlier warning, he turned on the flashlight inside the Haunted House.A ray of light shot through the long corridor, shining on the monster. The light attracted the monster\u2019s attention who turned \u2018his\u2019 head and glared at them through the curtain of long hair.At that moment, the group of medical students had their hairs stand on end. The monster had a face that was sewn together with the features of several males. The stitches on the mask observable even through the distance!The monster seemed to be ultra-sensitive to light because when the light hit \u2018him\u2019, \u2018he\u2019 went berserk and started to charge down the corridor, waving the hammer crazily in the air!The chains knocked into the walls as the heavy footsteps echoed across the thin corridor. As the madman approached, it was unknown who was the first to move, but it created a domino effect, and the group of students scattered to run for their lives.Some hid inside the nearest room, others rushed down the stairs to hide on the second floor, while some shot down directly to the first floor.Everyone was spooked by the sudden appearance of the monster, and the approaching footsteps and clinking chains deeply unsettled them. Fight or flight was a natural human response to threats, and when the brain sensed this was a fight that they could not win, they naturally chose to escape and run.Xiao Hui was the one closest to the stairs. When the monster rushed at them, she was a bit at a loss, and the man beside her suddenly turned and ran down the stairs. Her brain frizzled by fear, she did not think twice and ran after the man. At the time, her instinct was merely to run away from the monster.The phone was left in a forsaken corner. The calmness of the group of students was completely shattered, and screams tore through the corridor. The group dispersed like a flock of spooked chickens.When Xiao Hui followed the man before her to the first floor, the screaming from the third floor had not ceased. Then came a halting tempo to the sound of the chains, which sounded like the monster was coming down the stairs!Xiao Hui increased her pace and did not dare turn back. She kept close to the man in front of her, afraid that she might be left stranded. The creepy music and endless screams caused fear to breed within Xiao Hui\u2019s heart. The bigger the fear, the greater the need for company.She chased after the shadow before her like her life depended on it. The shadow had become a rock for her to rely on inside the darkened Haunted House.No matter what happens, at least we\u2019ll be able to look after each other.\u00a0Xiao Hui did not dare imagine what would happen if she was abandoned all alone inside the Haunted House. To prevent that from happening, she picked up pace again and reached out to grab the shirt of the person in front of her.The sound of chains drew closer. Xiao Hui was led by the person to the first floor, where he ran into one of the rooms to hide.A dead-end?\u00a0Xiao Hui paused at the door while she saw the man jumped into the only furniture in the room, a cupboard to hide. At this juncture, Xiao Hui only had two options left: run on her own or hide inside the cupboard alongside the man.The sound of the chains dragging on the floor came closer, and she decided on the latter option. Once the cupboard door was closed, it seemed like she had entered a different world, one that was filled with darkness and silence. The only thing that made her feel safe was at least she had a companion with her.The make-up on her face had already been ruined. Holding her breath, Xiao Hui leaned toward the crack to try to take a look outside.She saw the chains glint in the dark. The doctor stopped at the door. \u2018He\u2019 used the hammer to knock on the door before walking into the room.Xiao Hui\u2019s heart was racing at an impossible pace. She bit on her finger and shrank deeper into the cupboard, her heart praying softly,\u00a0Please don\u2019t come any closer, please don\u2019t come any closer.Her prayers were answered because the doctor only took a look around before \u2018he\u2019 left. Xiao Hui sighed in relief and lightly shook the arm of the person beside her. \u201cThe monster doesn\u2019t seem to have spotted us. We\u2019ll wait for a little longer, and then we\u2019ll go meet up with the rest.\u201dOnly Xiao Hui\u2019s voice could be heard echoing inside the cramped cupboard. She waited for a response, but there was no answer. She frowned, feeling something was wrong as she turned to look at the man.The man hiding inside the cupboard with her had an average frame, neither thin nor fat.Definitely not Monkey or Lao Zhao: Brother Feng is taller than this, and He San is smaller.\u00a0Xiao Hui called out cautiously, \u201cLao Song?\u201dThere was still no answer. Xiao Hui\u2019s heart cracked with tension.\u00a0Wait a minute, Lao Zhao did say there was an eighth member among us\u2026Xiao Hui\u2019s blood started to chill, and her breath caught in her throat. Xiao Hui slowly pulled out the phone in her pocket. She turned her phone to the side, its cold light flashing. In the sealed compartment, a deathly white and completely unfamiliar face was staring right back at her.The phone slipped from her fingers, and after two seconds of absolute silence, an ear-splitting scream escaped from within the cupboard!Xiao Hui scooted back in an attempt to escape, but the cupboard was only so big. In her desperation, the back of her head knocked against the cupboard wall, and perhaps from the pain or perhaps due to the shock, this fashionable girl collapsed to the floor of the cupboard with her head lolling to the side, appearing as if she was about to die in a few minutes.\u201cDidn\u2019t I already warn you guys not to use your phones inside my Haunted House?\u201d Chen Ge pushed the cupboard door open, picked up the phone from inside the cupboard, and shoved it inside Xiao Hui\u2019s pocket.

He had himself cooped up in the corner where he could get a good view of the staircase, so no matter which direction the murderer came from, he would be able to escape as fast as possible.The lights in the scenario seemed to have gotten dimmer, and the eerie music toyed with his heart. Monkey pinched himself to focus and took a deep breath. As a medical student, he knew pain and oxygen were the best elements to make one calm down rapidly.Monkey went through what happened earlier in his mind.\u00a0The timing of the monster\u2019s appearance is just too weird. He rushed at us right after Lao Zhao pointed out there was an eighth character hidden among us; that is too much of a coincidence.Everyone lost their cool when Lao Zhao made that stupid discovery. If Brother Feng was allowed to use his phone and looked through us carefully, the eighth person would have been readily exposed. That was our first mistake. After the monster rushed at us, if we stood our ground and didn\u2019t rush off like a bunch of headless chicken, we would have been fine. That was our second mistake.Monkey sighed slightly.\u00a0Yes, the monster rushing at us was scary, but it should not have been enough to make us all run off like that. It all started when that first person ran. His action ruined our thoughts, so if I\u2019m not mistaken, that first runner was the eighth person. Earlier, I heard Xiao Hui\u2019s scream; she was the second to run and was closest to the mystery man, so this supports my hypothesis.Monkey laughed self-deprecatingly. Then again, guessing it right and not being scared were too different thing. After all, being stranded all alone in this creepy Haunted House did still cause chills to rise up his spine.\u00a0The monster and the eighth person were working together, using psychological pressure to instill fear in us. If I\u2019m not mistaken, their plan has always been to split us apart and then take us down one by one. Does the proprietor need to rely on such wicked psychological techniques just to scare someone?Monkey was a brilliant student, but he was as big a coward as He San. In school, he did not dare enter the morgue unless accompanied.\u00a0I need to relay this information to Brother Feng and the others as soon as possible.He took out his phone to call Brother Feng, and when he saw the stuff that was reflected in the shining surface of his phone, he trembled all over.\u00a0Why is this ragdoll sitting on the stairs? Didn\u2019t I leave it on the third floor earlier?Monkey did not dare utilize the flashlight function, lest he attracted the unwanted attention of the monster. He turned his phone display toward the wall, and he saw a tattered ragdoll was lying against it.Did someone accidentally kick it downstairs in the earlier commotion?\u00a0This was the only valid explanation Monkey could come up with. The ragdoll was filled with paper pieces and not mechanical parts, so it could not have been remote-controlled.\u00a0It\u2019s quite scary lying there like that.Other than its slightly worn state, there was not anything particularly scary about the doll, but as Monkey stared at it, he had this suspicious feeling that it was alive. Monkey could not understand it either, but for some reason, he saw a young girl looking pleadingly at him when he looked at the doll.I must be hallucinating. Either way, I have to leave this Haunted House as soon as possible if I want to keep my sanity.\u00a0Monkey called Brother Feng, and a ringing sound came from the third floor.He\u2019s still up on the third floor? Or did he lose his phone like Lao Zhao did?\u00a0The ringing sound of the phone weirdly enough made the Haunted House feel creepier. Monkey did not hang up but shoved his phone into his pocket and slowly climbed up the stairs to the third floor. Hiding on the staircase, he looked down the corridor, and as he expected, Brother Feng\u2019s phone was left ringing on the floor.Both Brother Feng and Lao Zhao have left their phones; I\u2019ll have to try someone else.Standing alone at the third-floor staircase, watching the doors on either side of the corridor swing open and shut due to the draft, Monkey was feeling weak in his knees.He scrolled down his contact list rapidly to look for other people\u2019s contact number when his phone vibrated and rang.F*ck! What now!\u00a0It was a call from one of the group members.\u00a0Shi Ling? Why did she call me? Or is she also stranded alone like I am?Like most young men, Monkey puffed his chest up with courage when he was interacting with a member of the opposite six. \u201cShi Ling, did you get lost from everyone else? Where are you now? I\u2019ll come get you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m trapped inside a room on the third floor; I didn\u2019t catch the room number, but please come and get me. This Haunted House is all sorts of wrong!\u201d Shi Ling was normally a quiet and reserved girl. To be able to make her talk in such a drastic and hurried tone, something traumatic must have happened to her. She sounded like she was on the brink of tears.\u201cSlow down, how did you get trapped? None of the rooms have locks,\u201d Monkey explained as he walked down the corridor, trying to locate the room Shi Ling was in through the sound of her voice.\u201cI also don\u2019t know. After I ran in to hide, I was unable to open it anymore! And this room is different from others; there are two dolls sitting right in the middle of the room, side by side!\u201d\u201cSitting\u203d\u201d The mention of dolls made Monkey\u2019s hair rise. If he did not see another doll in his life ever again, he would be satisfied.\u201cPlease come and get me!\u201d Shi Ling\u2019s voice turned shrill. From the sound of it, her sanity was fraying.\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a moment! Just get as far away from the dolls as you can for now and listen to what He San said earlier, do not touch anything in the room, I suspect those dolls\u2026\u201d Monkey halted mid-sentence because he suddenly realized that there was a ragdoll blocking his path, lying on the floor about half a meter away from his feet.Resisting the urge to scream and toss the phone at the doll, Monkey took cautious steps toward it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLong hair with an expression of guilt and self-reparation, different from the doll on the staircase. This one looks much mature in age.\u00a0After he thought that, Monkey\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0What on Earth\u2026 how did I manage to read so many emotions from a mere doll? Is this fear talking? Or are the dolls too authentic? For some reason, I feel like they\u2019re like human beings with real emotions.In any case, now is not the time to think about that. As long as the doll before me is not the one I saw on the stairs, then everything is fine. At least this proves that the dolls don\u2019t know how to move on their own. Things aren\u2019t as bad as I imagine. Focus, the most crucial mission now is to rescue Shi Ling.Monkey shook his head violently, trying to steady his mind. He cheered himself on.\u00a0I\u2019m merely scaring myself. If the doll from the staircase was indeed following me, she would not have appeared in front of me, right? She should be behind me. This is merely a trick by the boss; there\u2019s no need to be afraid.To convince himself, Monkey turned to look behind him.\u00a0See, there\u2019s nothing\u2026Monkey\u2019s eyes zeroed in on a spot about one meter behind him, and the rest of his sentence was forcefully cut off.

He swore to never curse himself inside a Haunted House anymore.Separated from his group, stranded with no help, standing in the middle of a darkened corridor, chased by a crazed murderer that could appear at any moment, and haunted by dolls that would be there wherever he turned to look\u2026 this kind of hellish Haunted House experience made Monkey\u2019s breathing unsteady. \u201cWhy did it appear here? When did it follow me? How can it move?\u201dHis brain was swamped with endless questions, his composure was brutally shattered, and his hands that held the phone were shaking violently.\u201cMonkey, where are you\u203d Please come save me! I feel like the dolls in the room are looking at me! I swear to God, they are!\u201d A maddened voice screamed through the phone; Shi Ling\u2019s situation was not looking so good either.\u201cSister, I\u2019ll save you, but who is going to save me?\u201d Monkey instinctively took a step back from the source of danger. He felt like something was tugging at his ankle, he turned to look at the doll that was originally a distance away from him was lying beside his shoe.The black hair felt weirdly authentic, and the burned face was turned upwards. The facial features were completely ruined, but it gave a peculiar feeling.\u00a0It\u2019s smiling!Monkey could not explain why this thought would appear in his mind, and honestly, he did not to understand why; the things that he had experienced in the past ten minutes were about to break his sanity.He bit on his lips and nudged his feet, trying to leave. Perhaps it was fear or perhaps he had been standing for far too long, but the muscles on his calves shrank, and a shot of pain tore through his heart.\u00a0F*ck! Cramps!Monkey toppled to the ground. He had given up on his dignity. Clutching his legs, he screamed, \u201cIs someone there\u203d I quit! I quit! Help me, please!\u201dChen Ge and Xu Wan were stuck on the first floor at the time, hauling Lao Song, who was scared dumb, out of the scenario through the workers\u2019 passageway when they heard the blood-curdling scream from the third floor. Safety was their first priority, so neither of them dared dawdle and ran up to the third floor.After they entered the corridor, Chen Ge saw Monkey rolling on the floor. He had Xiao Wan retreat, and he walked over to the young man with his flashlight on. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\u201cI quit! I quit forever, please let me go.\u201dOne could say that Monkey was a changed man. Chen Ge did not promise anything but squatted down to press on Monkey\u2019s knees. \u201cExert force and try to straighten your knees.\u201dAs he helped Monkey ease his pain, Chen Ge glanced around the area; he was confused.\u00a0Neither Xiao Wan nor myself were even close to this place, so why did this fella get so scared?Other than the two ragdolls on the floor, there was nothing out of place. Thus, Chen Ge asked, \u201cBrother, what spooked you so?\u201d\u201cDo you even need to ask?\u201d Monkey\u2019s eyes were red, and like a scorned woman, he grumbled, \u201cThese two ragdolls were chasing after me; you were controlling them, weren\u2019t you? You sick bastard!\u201d\u201cThese two ragdolls were chasing after you?\u201d Chen Ge paused. He did not tell Monkey the truth lest he scarred the young man\u2019s mind forever. \u201cIn any case, let me get you out first.\u201d\u201cWait, there\u2019s another person trapped on this floor. She\u2019s gone almost mad, please save her as well.\u201d Monkey took out his phone to contact Shi Ling. When Monkey was not paying attention, Chen Ge picked up both of the dolls and held them in his palm. The dolls were small and could not be called exquisite; they were more like hand-made dolls produced in children\u2019s arts and crafts classes.These two managed to scare an adult until his leg cramped up?\u00a0Chen Ge used his finger to poke one of the dolls\u2019 faces. For some reason, he managed to feel a sense of reluctance from the doll at having her cheek poked but being powerless to stop it.\u00a0Interesting\u2026Following Shi Ling\u2019s scream for help, Chen Ge and Monkey managed to locate the room she was trapped in and opened the door from the outside.\u201cDon\u2019t be scared, we\u2019ll get you out now.\u201dThe girl paid Chen Ge no heed. She was quivering at the corner of the room, her lips quivering as she stammered senselessly, \u201cThe dolls are looking at me! No matter where I hide, their eyes keep following me!\u201d\u201cMore dolls?\u201d Chen Ge looked toward the center of the room where two slightly larger dolls lay side by side.\u201cThey were sitting up earlier, I swear!\u201d Shi Ling\u2019s teary eyes were filled with fear.\u201cI know, they\u2019re all\u2026 parts of the Haunted House\u2019s tricks.\u201d Chen Ge tried consoling the girl before walking to the dolls. One of them had a sewn beard while the other was wearing an apron over her normal clothes.Based on these details, these two should be the father and mother.\u00a0He placed the dolls he had picked up earlier on the floor, and the four did look like a family.This matches the number of victims at Ping An Apartments arson perfectly, and this Murder by Midnight scenario is inspired by Ping An Apartments, so could these four dolls actually represent the actual victims?As that thought entered Chen Ge\u2019s mind, he felt the black phone in his pocket vibrate. He pulled it out to take a look; there was new message.\u201cSpecters\u2019 Favored. Congratulations for triggering the sole Hidden Mission inside the Murder by Midnight scenario!

The scenario unlocked by the black phone comes with Hidden Missions?\u00a0This was a huge discovery for Chen Ge\u00a0The unfinished business of the spirits from Ping An Apartments had to do with Wang Qi. Detaining him so that he would be punished by the law should resolve that business already, no?Chen Ge held Shi Ling and Monkey as he led them downstairs, but his mind was contemplating the Hidden Mission. After they exited the workers\u2019 passageway, Chen Ge did not return to the scenario immediately but rushed to the Props Room alone. He picked out Wang Qi\u2019s missing person notice from the bottom of the box.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis thing could be useful to the victims.\u00a0With an idea in his mind, Chen Ge returned to the room on the third floor where Shi Ling had been trapped in earlier.As he crossed the threshold, Chen Ge spotted something weird.The three dolls that represented the parents and elder sister were lying flatly on the floor, but the smallest doll was lying with her face down near the door like she was in the middle of escaping. Chen Ge picked the doll up, and upon closer inspection, he had this curious sensation that the doll was playing dead, afraid of being discovered. For some reason, instead of feeling scared, he found it quite cute and charming.\u00a0The victims\u2019 spirits are probably inside these dolls.Closing the door behind him, Chen Ge sat down at the middle of the room.\u201cIn that case, perhaps we can have a little talk.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The scene was weird to say the least. Thankfully, there was no one else there to observe.\u201cI don\u2019t know how or why you\u2019ve appeared inside my Haunted House, and I\u2019m not sure how to refer to any of you, but there\u2019s one thing I can guarantee\u2014I mean none of you any harm.\u201dChen Ge\u2019s voice echoed in the room. Looking at the four dolls before him, a contradictory feeling rose in his heart. On one hand he wished there was a response to confirm his suspicion, but on the other, he was afraid that the dolls would suddenly move to do something dangerous.Several seconds later, Chen Ge felt like he was overthinking and decided to switch his way of thinking. \u201cThe Murder by Midnight scenario is based off of the arson four years ago at Fu An Apartments, and the four of you should be the victims of that case.\u201dProbably hitting a sore spot, Chen Ge could feel the temperature in the room dropping. The door was suddenly locked behind him, and the furniture around him rattled slightly.\u201cBut the case has been solved! The madman who ruined your lives and hurt you has been captured and is awaiting the law\u2019s judgement!\u201d Chen Ge was slightly unhinged by this sudden development. He pulled out his phone to find the morning news on the internet. \u201cLook, see, it\u2019s on the news, and the person who caught him is me!\u201dChen Ge knew the four dolls\u2019 unfinished business had plenty to do with Wang Qi, so he wanted to use the video as proof that he was the one who had captured him to placate the dolls, but it was not working as well as he planned.The atmosphere in the room turned increasingly chilly. Chen Ge was panicking, but he had no better idea; the inability to communicate between the two parties was his biggest hurdle. The lack of results unsettled Chen Ge, but he did not plan to give up so easily. This Haunted House was everything he had. If he allowed the dolls free reign of the place, there would be too many unknown elements; if some huge accidents happened in the future, he would lose everything.\u201cCalm down! I\u2019m here to help!\u201d The dolls were not paying Chen Ge any attention. No matter how loud he screamed, it was pointless.\u201cI guess this is my final option.\u201d Chen Ge pulled out Wang Qi\u2019s missing person notice from his pocket. The yellowed piece of paper was dirtied with some blood stains, but beyond that, there was nothing particularly special about it. However, weirdly enough, when Chen Ge pulled out the notice, the noisiness in the room settled, and the atmosphere was not as intense as before. It was as if the hands that were strangling his neck were slowly relaxing.\u201cAll you wanted was this?\u201d The effect of the notice was better than Chen Ge expected. He placed the paper in the middle of the four dolls, and when the dolls\u2019 bodies touched the yellowed paper, the missing person notice started to struggle like it was fluttering in a raging wind.The scene that happened before his eyes were definitely inexplicable. The room did not have any draft, but the notice and the four dolls were swaying like crazy. Chen Ge studied this closely. Several minutes later, a human face seemed to appear on the missing person notice; it looked suspiciously like Wang Qi. Before Chen Ge could take a closer look, the notice was torn apart. The pieces snuck into all four of the dolls\u2019 bodies, and the room returned to its usual quietness.\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201dThe black phone in his pocket vibrated. Chen Ge took it out to find a new message.\u201cYou\u2019ve completed the Hidden Mission inside the Murder by Midnight scenario! Increase the affection of specters by one. Obtained the goodwill of the victims\u2019 lingering spirits from Ping An Apartment. They will help you clean up all the trash every day to keep the Murder by Midnight scenario at its peak.\u201dLooking at the message on the phone, Chen Ge stood where he was for a long time before he said to no one in particular, \u201cAnd that completes the sole Hidden Mission?\u201dHis mind tried to collate all the information he had gathered so far.\u00a0Finishing a Trial Mission with a completion rate higher than ninety percent will reward me a Hidden Item, and the Hidden Item will be the key to completing the scenario\u2019s Hidden Mission! In other words, if I want to have complete mastery of the unlocked scenarios of the Haunted House in the future, I\u2019ll need to finish the respective Trial Mission with a more than ninety percent completion rate.Thinking back, if he had just survived the night at Ping An Apartment without being a busybody, he would have completed the Trial Mission as well, but he wouldn\u2019t have gotten the Hidden Item.This thing is evil. This kind of set-up is just asking the player to walk into as many traps as he can.\u00a0Chen Ge searched through the black phone, attempting to figure out more information. The first thing he clicked was the \u2018My Team of Ghosts and Ghouls\u2019 tab, and to his disappointment, it was still empty.The mission notice states that I\u2019ve gained the goodwill of the victims\u2019 lingering spirit from Ping An Apartment, but there\u2019s no update to the window. Is it because they haven\u2019t agreed to help me completely or can lingering spirits not be counted as ghosts nor ghouls, so they don\u2019t show up on the list?Chen Ge had no clue. He clicked into the \u2018My Item Storage\u2019 and realized Wang Qi\u2019s Missing Person Notice was still there, but the Malice Points attached to it were now zero.What are these Malice Points? And why did the lingering spirits tear it up to feed on it?The door to the hidden world was slowly opening. Chen Ge had no clue whether this information was useful or not, but he committed it all to memory. He rubbed the sweat on his forehead and stood up from the floor.\u00a0Even though I couldn\u2019t communicate with the lingering spirits, they\u2019ll help up clean up the scenario. Conclusively speaking, it\u2019s still more advantages than disadvantages.Maintaining the scenario was a troublesome and tiring thing, and the appearance of the lingering spirits saved Chen Ge plenty of time, money, and effort. Looking at the four dolls on the floor, the last vestige of fear in Chen Ge\u2019s heart slowly disappeared.\u00a0Hiring the ghosts to help out at my Haunted House isn\u2019t such a ridiculous idea after all.He walked to the door and turned around with concern. The dolls that represented the parents and the sister were sitting where they were, but the smallest doll was collapsed on the floor, leaning on her side. She was acting secretively, like she was preparing to sneak out again.Chen Ge sighed, looking at this, and he realized not all ghosts in the world were evil and cruel. For example, this smallest doll was like a kitten that was curious about the world, easily intrigued but a coward at her core.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLittle girl, stop running about. Be careful or you\u2019ll get stepped on.\u201dChen Ge left after that. After helping the lingering spirits from Ping An Apartments with their wish, he had a deeper understanding of the black phone.The unlockable scenarios on the phone probably aren\u2019t just to help me scare people. Each scenario has its own story and plot with its own reason and development. In a way, unlocking the scenarios is helping these homeless souls find a place to call home.After turning off the flashlight, Chen Ge walked down the darkened corridor alone. After he was far enough gone, ensuring no human or ghost could hear him anymore, his lips curved involuntarily upwards to reveal a foxlike grin. \u201cThese are natural experts at scaring people, and they don\u2019t need salary, won\u2019t complain about tiredness, or act out of emotions; they are the perfect employees!\u201dWith a bright future awaiting him, Chen Ge felt reenergized and was ready to scare the shit out of his hapless victims.\u201cIt has dragged on for too long already; it\u2019s time to end this.

We\u2019ll be using the time they give us to find the exit and achieve victory.\u201d Lao Zhao was as round as a ball.

What if we\u2019re the only two left in the Haunted House?\u201d He San turned to look at his senior behind him. For some reason, he felt his senior was merely using him as a human shield.\u201cWe\u2019ve checked all the rooms on the second floor and most of the rooms on the third floor, so the exit has to be on the first floor. In other words, we\u2019re inches away from victory.\u201d Lao Zhao patted He San encouragingly on his shoulder. \u201cChin up, don\u2019t give up now when we\u2019re at the gate of victory.\u201d\u201cEven at a time like this, you\u2019re still calm enough to feed me such crap?\u201d He San pouted. He had many grievances to voice, but he did not know how to. He was supposed to only lead his seniors to New Century Park, so why was he there inside the Haunted House?\u201cDon\u2019t be so pessimistic.\u201d Lao Zhao counted on his fingers. \u201cWe heard Monkey and Xiao Hui\u2019s screams earlier, so both of them have probably been led out of this place already. Minus the eighth person, we still have five students from our school inside this Haunted House. The probability of the murderer hunting us is two in five, which is smaller than three in five, so don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll only need to wait.\u201d\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll do it your way.\u201d Squatting at the door, He San leaned to peer out the crack. He felt like there was an additional something in the darkened corridor. He rubbed his eyes and took a closer look in the same direction. There was a worn ragdoll lying on the floor.What\u2019s wrong with my eyes? Was there a doll on the floor to begin with? But that\u2019s impossible. During the ten minutes I\u2019ve hiding here, I\u2019ve kept my eyes on the corridor outside.\u00a0He San slapped himself lightly on the cheeks before turning to look out of the crack again. The doll was still there, but it had moved closer to the door.It can move on its own? Am I imagining things from nervousness?\u00a0He San shook his head before peering out the crack again.This time, the doll had disappeared.This is weird\u2026\u2026At the first floor\u2019s workers\u2019 passageway, Chen Ge put on the Doctor Skull-cracker\u2019s garb after he had Xu Wan leave to take care of the few students outside. He was going to catch the rest personally.Wearing the blood-soaked doctor\u2019s coat, curling the iron chains that were carved with human faces on his body, gripping the hammer, and putting on the human skin mask, be it from height or presence, Chen Ge\u2019s Doctor Skull-cracker was more intimidating than Xiao Wan\u2019s.These youths want to fight an extended battle with me?\u00a0The chains clinked viciously with his every step. It might have sounded eerie, but the greatest weakness was that it would give his location away. Chen Ge roamed the scenario for about five minutes but could not find anyone.\u201cBoss, I can\u2019t spot them on the cameras. They should be hiding inside the many rooms; you\u2019ll need to check them one by one.\u201d Xu Wan\u2019s voice came into his ear. \u201cSpeaking of which, I suggest we install surveillance camera in every corner of the Haunted House. Now, with only cameras on the intersecting corridors, there are too many blind spots.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll think about that when we have the money.\u201d Chen Ge used his mallet to push the door of each room open. When he reached a corner on the second floor, he spotted a doll leaning against one of the doors.\u201cLittle girl, why are you here, leaning against this room door for no reason?\u201d Chen Ge scratched his chin with the mallet, and the truth soon dawned on him. \u201cI know, you\u2019re telling me there\u2019s someone hiding inside this room, right?\u201dPretending like he did not notice anything, Chen Ge walked away from the door. When he was about ten meters away, Chen Ge picked up the chains that dragged along the floor and leaned against wall to silently move toward the door.Utilizing the blind spot, he half-squatted and peered in through the crack of the door.\u2026Inside the room, He San and Lao Zhao were squeezed behind the door with their palms over their mouths.\u201cThe sound of chains has disappeared; the murderer should have wandered off already.\u201d Lao Zhao\u2019s face was pale beyond belief, but he made sure his tone sounded calm to maintain his dignity as the senior. \u201cActually, I\u2019m not one bit scared. Based on my analysis, since the murderer just came up from the first floor, he won\u2019t be returning to it anytime soon; this is our chance!\u201dHe used plenty of energy to push himself off the floor. \u201cNow is the perfect time for us to go to the first floor. We\u2019ll be able to avoid the killer and achieve victory. Xiao San, you take a look out the door. If the murderer has wandered off already, we\u2019ll move out instantly.\u201dHe San felt like Lao Zhao was making some sense. He did not argue and leaned against the door to look out the crack. He felt something like warm breath blowing on his face. What He San saw this time was different from before. There was no darkened corridor or creepy doll but bloodshot eyes staring back at him from the other side of the crack!\u201cWhat the f*ck!\u201dHe San felt like his soul almost left his body. He collapsed to the floor dramatically and shuffled away from the door. This spooked Lao Zhao as well. \u201cWhat\u203d What did you see?\u201dThe answer that Lao Zhao got was the door knob being twisted open. The old door was slowly pushed open, and a bloodied shadow radiating evil and resentment hovered at the door. Seeing this, Lao Zhao kept retreating even though his back was already firmly pressed to the wall.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t lean so hard against the wall, what if there\u2019s someone inside it?\u201d Chen Ge silently poked his hand into the pocket and pressed the prop option that was available on the black phone.Lao Zhao was so scared that his fatty body was shaking all over. Before he understood what Chen Ge meant by that sentence, something suddenly poked into his back. He turned to look back over his shoulder instinctively, and the wallpaper behind him had opened on both sides to reveal an expressionless woman who was embedded inside the wall!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHis brain went blank, and something akin to his breath left Lao Zhao\u2019s body. He fell to the floor butt-first, and his eyes rolled back in his head.\u201cYour experience is now officially over, let me get you out.\u201d As Chen Ge said so, there was suddenly the sound of a mirror shattering coming from the third floor, which was closely followed by Brother Feng\u2019s scream.\u201cSh*t!\u201d Chen Ge called for Xiao Wan to come get He San and Lao Zhao while he raced upstairs. Following the voice, Chen Ge found Brother Feng inside one of the rooms, waving a wooden chair before him like he was in the middle of fighting some unknown force.He pulled down his mask and waited until Brother Feng tired himself out and slid to the floor before he walked into the room.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Chen Ge gingerly pulled the wooden chair away from Brother Feng and tossed it to the side. Brother Feng was in a highly unstable state. His eyes were filled with such fear that Chen Ge worried the young man was going into shock. \u201cDid you come across some weird things?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After placing Brother Feng on the bed, he walked into the toilet. The mirror on the wall had been shattered, and the glass pieces littered the floor.Earlier, after He San\u2019s fainting incident, Chen Ge had used black cloth to cover up all the mirrors in the Haunted House. There had been no accident since then, and with the unlocking of a new scenario, he should have been more alert, but he had not been. He was partly responsible for this accident.For any entertainment establishment, once it was labelled with the rumor of being a safety hazard, business would definitely be difficult, and Chen Ge was acutely aware of that scary fact. He picked up one of the pieces of the floor, and looking at his reflection inside it, he promised, \u201cI need to deal with this thing as soon as possible!\u201dLike human beings, ghosts also had the separation of good and evil. The monster in the mirror was definitely evil; Chen Ge was sure of that. It was naturally aggressive and was probably hiding some horrible secret. He San\u2019s fainting spell and Brother Feng\u2019s incident raised the alarm within Chen Ge, making him feel pressured.Covering the mirrors with black cloth was not a permanent solution. The thing inside the mirror was fast becoming a blockage for the Haunted House\u2019s expansion. Other than the broken mirror, there was nothing else out of place inside the toilet. Chen Ge took a cursory look of the room before leaving.With the hammer in his grip, he sat down beside Brother Feng. \u201cDo you mind telling what happened earlier?\u201dAfter a few minutes of rest, Brother Feng\u2019s breathing finally stabilized; however, his face was still startlingly pale. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be to explain it.\u201d\u201cNo worries, just tell me whatever you remember.\u201d Chen Ge studied Brother Feng quietly. This young man was different from He San, who fainted directly; his mental tolerance was obviously higher than He San\u2019s, an observation supported by the fact that at least he showed resistance.Brother Feng tried to sit up in bed, the fear still circling in his eyes. \u201cAt the time, I was chased by one of your workers, so I ran into this room to hide. Initially, everything was fine, but later, I started to hear someone calling my name.\u201d\u201cSomeone was calling your actual name?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that; it\u2019s more like I felt like I was being summoned.\u201d Brother Feng scratched his head. \u201cThe source of the sound was inside this room, and it took me a long time before I was able to find the source.\u201dAt this point, the fear in his eyes deepened. \u201cThe voice came from the mirror inside the toilet. It was saying something, but I couldn\u2019t really understand it. All I know is it had something to do with me.\u201d\u201cAnd then?\u201d Chen Ge memorized every word that came out of Brother Feng\u2019s lips; this would be valuable information when he dealt with the mirror monster.\u201cAnd then I stood in front of the mirror, trying to understand what was really happening. I tried to remove the mirror from the wall, but when my hands touched it, the voice beside my ears suddenly picked up. My consciousness started to waver, and for some reason, the reflection of myself in the mirror started to shift.\u201d Brother Feng\u2019s eyes kept glancing at the toilet, afraid that some monster might jump out of it at any moment. \u201cI stood in front of the mirror, but the reflection in the mirror wasn\u2019t me. Normally, I would be afraid, but what happened next still sends shivers down my spine when I think of it.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201dBrother Feng said seriously, \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t feel any fear or apprehension. It was like everything couldn\u2019t have been more normal. I started to lean toward the mirror, and when my face was close to the surface, I could see the face of the other me also leaning close. The face that stared at me was mine, but for some reason, it felt very unfamiliar. If you want me to point out why, I can\u2019t really tell you, but it\u2019s just a feeling that the face that stared back at me wasn\u2019t mine. Out of the corner of my eyes, I could see my hands rising even though my brain didn\u2019t register such a command. My hands pressed against the surface of the mirror like I was trying to crawl into it or\u2026 that\u2019s not right, it felt more like I was trapped inside the mirror, and I was trying to crawl out of it.\u201dDuring the Nightmare Mission, Chen Ge had gone through the same thing. Looking through the recording on his video, his body was indeed slowly leaning against the mirror. \u201cThen, how did you remove yourself from this situation?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also thanks to the mirror.\u201d This answer surprised Chen Ge. \u201cAt the time, it really felt like my body was no longer under my control until I saw a ragdoll lying behind me through the reflection inside the mirror.\u201d\u201cA ragdoll?\u201d\u201cYes, similar to the dolls I saw lying around the other rooms. It\u2019s the size of an open palm and had a sewn beard on its face.\u201d Brother Feng used his hands to measure out the size for Chen Ge. \u201cThe sudden appearance of the doll caused my brain to scream with alarm, and fear spread through my body like wildfire. There was only one thought on my mind then\u2014escape. However, the body refused to listen to my command; the mind and the body started fighting.\u201dBrother Feng described it in a placid tone, but Chen Ge could imagine how dangerous it was.\u201cAfter that, I heard He San\u2019s scream coming up from the second floor. That seemed to do the trick and break the spell.\u201d The fear in Brother Feng\u2019s eyes had dissipated slightly. \u201cI was so scared that my first instinct was to grab the nearest wooden chair to swing at the mirror. Your Haunted House is so scary and atmospheric that I completely forgot I was inside a park attraction.\u201dAt this point, Brother Feng suddenly remembered something and smiled apologetically at Chen Ge. \u201cEverything I told you is the truth; there\u2019s no exaggeration or anything. I will pay the replacement fee for the mirror in full.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary; I\u2019m just glad that you\u2019re safe.\u201d Chen Ge stood up, and his eyes wandered about the room. \u201cBy the way, where is the doll that you saw now?\u201dBrother Feng hesitated before answering. \u201cI seem to remember kicking it under the bed. That\u2019s also part of your props, right? I\u2019m sorry.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChen Ge squatted down and pulled out the doll with a dusty footprint on it out from under the bed. He patted the dust off its body and said, \u201cYou should thank this doll; it was he who saved you.\u201d\u201cThe doll saved me? If you say so\u2026 Thank you, so can I go now?\u201d Brother Feng inched subconsciously backward, and his face paled considerably. He could feel the odd presence surrounding this Haunted House\u2019s proprietor, but since Chen Ge did come to save him, he forced out a polite thank you.\u201cIf I told you that everything that you experienced earlier wasn\u2019t part of the Haunted House\u2019s props or special effects and was all real, would you believe me?\u201dWearing the blood-soaked outfit, cradling the tattered doll, Chen Ge tilted his head to the side as he posed this question to the young man.The poor Brother Feng, who was about 190 centimeters tall, was curled up like a little girl at the corner of the bed and answered with a tone laced with helplessness, \u201cI don\u2019t know, you tell me, should I believe it or not?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Looking at Chen Ge, who stood in the middle of the room, he could envision the man killing people and cutting up body parts just to add to the authenticity of his Haunted House. He started to fear for his life.\u201cLook at you, all serious. I\u2019m just kidding.\u201d Chen Ge was quite disappointed. He asked that question because he spotted something unique in Brother Feng. With a little push from the doll, Brother Feng managed to break free from the mirror monster\u2019s control and even fought back. His constitution was stronger than most and could have been a valuable ally.This was what Chen Ge admired about the young man. If possible, Chen Ge wished to befriend him and asked for his help to deal with supernatural events like the spirit inside the mirror. That was Chen Ge\u2019s intention, alas Brother Feng was far too distraught to catch the hidden meaning.Looks like I can only depend on myself,\u00a0Chen Ge thought to himself as he locked the door to the Murder by Midnight scenario. When he helped Brother Feng go down the stairs, the black phone in his pocket vibrated. Chen Ge jumped from shock. He quickly pulled out the phone afraid that it might be some bad news.\u201cNumber of Monthly Visitors surpassed 100. Reputation is now 60 percent positive. Congratulations for fulfilling the rules for expansion!\u201cWarning: Each expansion of the Haunted House will award you with a mysterious reward (After three expansions, the Haunted House will upgrade to a Maze of Terror)!\u201dI can expand so soon?\u00a0Expansion was a good thing, but temporarily, that was not part of Chen Ge\u2019s plan. The most crucial thing was still removing the stuff inside the mirror.After exiting the Haunted House, the sun shone gloriously on the steps. The students from Jiujiang Medical University were collectively collapsed in front of the Haunted House. They were either holding their heads in their palms or hugging their legs. Some had tears staining their make-up while others looked aimlessly up at the sky. The occasional twitching on their faces was the only sign that they were still alive for some.Chen Ge felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. However, the devastation this time was much greater than before. In just a mere forty minutes, the group of spirited youths had experienced such a drastic change; it was near miraculous.The surrounding visitors were mumbling and pointing among themselves, but Chen Ge did not think too much of it. After all, if it wasn\u2019t exciting, how could it be called a House of Horrors?He dropped Brother Feng to the ground, completing the collection; the whole \u2018happy family\u2019 was finally together again.\u201cXiao Chen! Come here.\u201d The gathering crowd once again attracted Uncle Xu\u2019s attention. The middle-aged man had on an expression that said \u2018what am I going to do with you\u2019 when he saw Chen Ge. \u201cExplain yourself, what is it this time? You already scared someone until he fainted last time, and this time you toppled seven in one go! Are you that insistent on getting our park on the headlines?\u201dChen Ge\u2019s eyes darted around, and he coughed drily. \u201cThey came to experience the Haunted House, and what I did was present to them the best service, so how is this my fault? Furthermore, I can promise I had zero physical contact with them, which you can check on the security footage. Everything is all within the required rules of operating a Haunted House.\u201d\u201cStop acting dumb. If that\u2019s the case, how do you explain the bump on the back of her head?\u201d Uncle Xu surreptitiously pointed at the back of Xiao Hui\u2019s head, afraid that he might accidentally scare the poor girl, and he kept his voice to a whisper.\u201cUncle Xu, I swear, I\u2019m completely innocent on that count. I was running ahead, and she pulled on my shirt as she ran behind me. I crawled into the cupboard to hide, and she wanted to follow me. All I did was lie there quietly; it was she who turned on the flashlight to shine on me. It almost blinded my eyes, but before I could say anything, she knocked herself on the wall of the cupboard. See, I\u2019m also a victim here.\u201d Chen Ge described the \u2018truth\u2019 with only a slight variation.\u201cIn other words, you\u2019re the one who has suffered?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious?\u201d\u201cStop treating this like such a joke. Be more careful and attentive in future, and make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d Uncle Xu advised him with a sigh. \u201cWhat if you cause an accident? Or your client happens to be someone unreasonable? It\u2019ll greatly influence your Haunted House\u2019s future.\u201d\u201cI know, I know. Is there any more kind advice?\u201d Chen Ge didn\u2019t directly retort, but he grumbled internally,\u00a0If there is really someone unreasonable, I\u2019ll just give them the love letter. We\u2019ll see who\u2019s more unreasonable then.Uncle Xu stared at Chen Ge and knew perfectly well that his words would not be heeded. He sighed to himself and continued several seconds later. \u201cXiao Chen, I know it\u2019s not required for you to listen to me, but certain things have to be said now that your parents are no longer here.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d\u201cThis morning, Xu Wan said you were on television, claiming that the key witness who helped solve the arson case four years ago is you.\u201d Uncle Xu did not look one bit happy.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy would you go to a haunted house late at night? Do you know how dangerous that is? Those are murderers!\u201d Uncle Xu did not leave Chen Ge any openings to counter. \u201cIf you\u2019re in need of money, there are many other methods rather than going for this reward money. I can help you cover the utility bills you owe the park management for now. You\u2019re still young, be careful not to stray from the righteous path.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Uncle Xu, I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\u201cI hope so. In that case, if there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll be leaving. Quickly get those people off the floor. It reflects badly on the park letting them lie like that on the floor.\u201d As Uncle Xu turned to leave, Chen Ge stopped him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cUncle Xu, I really do have a favor to ask,\u201d Chen Ge said shyly. \u201cCan you please lend me 5,000 RMB? I plan to install cameras in every corner of the Haunted House. I\u2019ll pay you back when the reward money arrives.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter He San and Brother Feng\u2019s \u2018accidents\u2019, Chen Ge was indeed worried. There were too many blind spots inside the Haunted House.\u201cYou still want to invest in the Haunted House?\u201d Uncle Xu stopped moving. \u201cXiao Chen, I can lend you the money, but I\u2019ll be honest with you, this park of ours is on its last legs; investing here is no different from throwing money into the sea.\u201dHe led Chen Ge to a shaded area before explaining, \u201cThis park has been around for eleven years already; its main attractions are all outdated. Nowadays, people want virtual reality, fashion, and creativity; we\u2019re none of those things. To put it simply, we\u2019re at the edge of being filtered out. Other than the Haunted House, the number of visitors for every single attraction in the park is on a steady decline.\u201d\u201cI know that.\u201d Chen Ge had already planned to work on his Haunted House, and increasing security was a definite first step.\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d Uncle Xu turned off the walkie-talkie. \u201cEastern Jiujiang\u2019s Virtual Reality Futuristic Carnival is close to its completion date. It will be one of the few fourth-gen amusement parks we have in this country. When it\u2019s open, it\u2019ll naturally become the go-to attraction of the city. Tell me, how are we going to compete with that? Now, every member of the park from the highest management to the lowest cleaners are slowing down as they figure out a way out for themselves. You\u2019re the only one left dumb enough to keep charging ahead.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, that new park isn\u2019t completed yet, so we still have a chance.\u201d Chen Ge\u2019s secret weapon was the black phone, but of course, he could not tell anyone that.\u201cYou\u2019re such a bright kid normally, so why are you so stubborn when it comes to crucial matters? Do you not see the eroding flow of time? I\u2019ve worked here for ten years already, so I also wish for this place to stay, but we have to surrender to reality.\u201dUncle Xu pointed at the few attractions that were already foreclosed around them. \u201cDo you know why they are all closed? Not because they did not pass the safety inspection as the rumors say, but because once they\u2019re turned on, they start to burn money. Having one or two visitors is not enough to break even. Imagine, when New Century Park was open, the place was crowded, our parking lot was not enough to support the crowd, so we had to rent the parking space from the nearby shops. The situation only got better after the new underground parking lot was built. But in the last three years, even during the height of holiday fever, the underground parking lot has never been needed. In fact, the number of visitors has been constantly dropping, and we\u2019ve reached a new low this year.\u201d\u201cUncle Xu, wait a minute, you said the underground parking lot hasn\u2019t been needed since three years ago, meaning the parking lot hasn\u2019t been used since then? Does this mean it\u2019s currently abandoned?\u201d Chen Ge had a glow in his eyes that made Uncle Xu uncomfortable.\u201cYes, when New Century Park was first open, there were cars and people everywhere. You would need to line up for at least two hours for any attraction. That was the time of our prime; alas, we\u2019re now slowly being forgotten by the city.\u201d Thinking about the past, Uncle Xu could not help but sigh. \u201cHowever, that\u2019s nothing to be sad about; after all, we were lucky enough to once enjoy a time of glory, right?\u201d\u201cUncle Xu, if one wished to rent the park\u2019s underground parking lot, how much would it cost?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Uncle Xu was confused by Chen Ge\u2019s sudden question. \u201cWhy would you ask that?\u201dA plan was forming in Chen Ge\u2019s mind. Now, he had found the ideal space to expand his Haunted House. \u201cI want to reuse the parking lot. According to what you said, it\u2019s currently in a half-abandoned state, so why not let me use it?\u201d\u201cHave you lost your mind? Why do you want to rent that place? To rear bats?\u201d Uncle Xu really feared that this young man had lost his mind.Since the park management would eventually catch on to what he was doing, Chen Ge did not consider lying about it. \u201cI want to expand the Haunted House. With my current financial situation, the underground parking lot is perfect. The rent won\u2019t be that high, and the underground environment is a perfect match for a Haunted House.\u201d\u201cKid, what\u2019s wrong with you today? A three-story Haunted House is not enough for you to worry about? Do you know how large the underground parking lot is? Even if the management is willing to rent it to you, when you finish setting up the place, the park will already be closed.\u201d Uncle Xu shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, you had better focus on your work.\u201d\u201cUncle Xu, I\u2019m serious.\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019m joking with you\u203d\u201d After switching the walkie-talkie back on, Uncle Xu wandered back to the crowd. When he was several steps away, he turned back to tell Chen Ge, \u201cI\u2019ll give you the 5,000 tomorrow morning, but make sure you keep your feet firmly on solid ground, stop imagining the impossible.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Chen Ge followed behind Uncle Xu. Looking at the crowd that had gathered in front of his Haunted House, he pouted. \u201cIn any case, I don\u2019t feel like the number of visitors has decreased. After all, my Haunted House has always enjoyed a zero visitor rate before this.\u201dAfter squeezing through the crowd, Chen Ge stood beside the group of students and said, \u201cRested enough already? If you don\u2019t get up soon, these people are going to think I did some immoral things to all of you.\u201d\u201cGive me a few more minutes, your Haunted House needs some time to digest.\u201d\u201cWhat are you looking at, I\u2019m not afraid. I merely sprained my ankle when I was in there, so that\u2019s why I can\u2019t get up now.\u201d\u201cEveryone looks like a killer to me now, what am I to do?\u201d\u201cStop being so stubborn, we lost to his Haunted House this time,\u201d Monkey said as he climbed down the steps. He waved the five stars review he just submitted on the Haunted House on his phone before Chen Ge and stood before the man saying, \u201cBut don\u2019t think that\u2019s the end of this. We\u2019re not going to surrender so easily.\u201d\u201cMeaning you all plan to come back tomorrow?\u201d\u201cIf not for the fact we have exams tomorrow, do you think would really be afraid of the challenge?\u201d Monkey sounded rather brave\u2026 if only his pale lips could stop quivering and his legs could stop shaking.\u201cEither way, my doors are always open for business should any of you want to come again.\u201d Chen Ge was close to treating the students from Jiujiang Medical University as his lucky charm.\u201cI will not be coming back again. You\u2019ll have to drag my dead body here if you want me to come back here.\u201d He San looked gloomily at Chen Ge. It looked like the young man was truly scarred by the bloodshot eye in the crack of the door.\u201cJunior, be careful what you wish for.\u201d Xiao Hui stood up with help from He San. She glared at Chen Ge. \u201cYou\u2019re the first man who has made me cry to the point that my make-up is all ruined; I\u2019ll definitely remember you.\u201dNoticing the bump on the back of Xiao Hui\u2019s head, he did not have the heart to fight back, so he merely smiled. The group of medical students headed toward the entrance of the park, holding each other for support. When Chen Ge thought they had left, Brother Feng came running back to him alone. With a complicated expression, he told Chen Ge, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about your question. I am still unable to believe that they\u2019re real, if anything, it\u2019s probably explainable using theories related to psychological trauma and stimulus.\u201dChen Ge knew what he was referring to. \u201cPerhaps, by the way, I haven\u2019t gotten your full name.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s He Feng, I\u2019m older than most of them and will be starting my residency in a few days.\u201d\u201cPleased to make your acquaintance, hopefully we\u2019ll meet again soon.\u201dAfter they exchanged phone numbers, Chen Ge returned to the Haunted House. He closed the gates and placed a sign saying \u2018Temporarily Closed for Maintenance\u2019 on it.\u201cBoss, there\u2019re still many visitors waiting outside. Why are we closing?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThere\u2019s a little problem, so we\u2019ll call it a day. Do you mind explaining it to the customers?\u201d Chen Ge took off the Doctor Skull-cracker outfit and went back to the Props room to cut up some black clothes before he headed back up the Murder by Midnight scenario.He started covering all the mirrors, but there were too many rooms, and he soon ran out of cloth.\u00a0This scenario is too big. Before the cameras are ready, I cannot risk the visitors\u2019 lives by having them up here; it\u2019s too dangerous.After locking up the door to the Murder by Midnight scenario, Chen Ge returned downstairs. The visitors outside the Haunted House had mostly left. Only one or two visitors still remained.\u201cXiao Wan, you can remove your make-up. It\u2019s time to go home.\u201dAfter saying goodbye to Xiao Wan, Chen Ge returned to the staff breakroom. He hadn\u2019t had a real rest since the day before, so he fell asleep the moment his head hit the pillow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the staff breakroom, Chen Ge\u2019s eyes slowly peeled open. He glanced at the phone\u2014it was 1:10 am.He turned to bury his head under the pillow, but the weird sound kept drilling itself into his ears.Am I dreaming? Who is making all that noise?Every single prop in the Haunted House was hand-made or upgraded by Chen Ge, so he knew that no prop in the building would make a sawing sound. After only six hours of sleep, Chen Ge was still feeling a bit blurry. He pinched the inside of his leg hard to wake himself up before putting on his clothes and grabbing an iron hammer out of the nearby toolbox.He switched on the flashlight and pushed the door of the breakroom open. The Haunted House at midnight was many times scarier than it was during daytime. Chen Ge leaned against the door, not in a hurry to go out.Can\u2019t be a burglar, would any sane person choose to rob a Haunted House near midnight? Can\u2019t be the rats either, the sound of their chewing wouldn\u2019t be so loud and clear.\u00a0After vetoing these two normal possibilities, Chen Ge\u2019s mind wandered toward the not-so-normal possibility.\u00a0Could it be that the monster has escaped from the mirror?Due to a lack of cloth, not all the mirrors on the third floor\u2019s Murder by Midnight scenario were covered up. He stared down the darkened hallway and retreated back into the breakroom. He only dared wander out after grabbing the doll his parents left behind for him. The sound came from above, so Chen Ge followed the sound up the stairs before stopping at the door to the Murder by Midnight scenario.As I expected, it\u2019s coming from here, but now it\u2019s unclear whether the source is the lingering spirits from Ping An Apartments or the mirror monster.\u00a0Chen Ge hesitated at the door. Honestly, he too was not that willing to enter a scary scenario so late at night.However, allowing himself to be tortured by the sawing sound was not a valid solution either. Chen Ge gripped the hammer in his hand and said in his heart,\u00a0I have The Specters\u2019 Favored title and have received the goodwill from the residents of Ping An Apartment\u2019s lingering spirits. Therefore, even if it is the thing from inside the mirror, it won\u2019t be able to do me much harm.He was reminded of what happened to He San. It was Xiao Wan\u2019s sudden appearance that ruined the thing\u2019s plan, so in a way, the monster probably was not as powerful as he made it out to be.I have to go in. After all, I\u2019ll need to deal with it eventually. The more I know about it, the greater the confidence I\u2019ll have in dealing with it.\u00a0Chen Ge calmed himself down. He told himself, he was not afraid of the monster itself but rather the unknown it represented.After pushing open the door, a faded smell of mold drifted into Chen Ge\u2019s nose; this place was getting closer to the actual environment of Ping An Apartments by the hour. The room doors on both sides of the corridor were half-closed. Chen Ge held the phone in one day while the other grabbed hold of the hammer.The sound of sawing intensified, a sign that Chen Ge was getting close to the truth. He walked through the entire third floor before stopping at the door that he was sure the sawing sound was coming from. The room door was closed, and as Chen Ge placed his palm over the doorknob, the icy feeling of steel jolted him awake. His muscles tensed as he shoved the door open.\u201cWho\u2019s in here\u203d\u201d Chen Ge yelled as he dashed into the room with the iron hammer raised high. He saw a well-built dark shadow half-squatting inside the toilet. It looked suspiciously like He Feng!The black shadow did not expect the interruption; it dropped what it was holding and jumped inside the mirror and disappeared.\u201cStop right there!\u201d Chen Ge screamed as he waved the hammer. It only made contact with air. The toilet was now empty like everything that he had just seen was an illusion.That shadow can\u2019t be He Feng! Why would it have a similar build to He Feng?Standing before the mirror, Chen Ge looked at his reflection, and he felt weirdly uncomfortable.\u00a0This monster is mimicking He Feng\u203d But why would it do that?The appearance of the black shadow brought many questions, but it also answered two for Chen Ge. One, the mirror monster had now gained the ability to leave the mirror; two, it could morph into the person who once looked inside the mirror.This thing is more dangerous than I thought.The sawing sound that echoed through the building had finally stopped. Chen Ge squatted down to examine what the black shadow had dropped earlier. Four ragdolls and several sharp mirror pieces were littered on the rough-hewn cement floor.Chen Ge held the dolls in his palms. The dolls that represented the mother and two sisters were fine, other than the normal dust and mud that covered their bodies. However, the doll that represented the father had its neck almost sawn off, and there were cuts all over its body.Why is the father doll the only one that\u2019s injured?However, Chen Ge soon realized why. The father doll helped He Feng escape from the monster\u2019s clutches, so this was an act of vengeance.It seems like the four lingering spirits aren\u2019t strong enough to stop the monster inside the mirror, so they could only allow themselves to be bullied by it.Chen Ge had no idea about the situation of the other world, so he could only come up with the explanation from all his previous observations.\u00a0The victims have no attack methods other than scaring people. The mirror monster is at least one level higher than the lingering spirits of the victims, but it runs whenever it is around humans. This means that the monster\u2019s physical combat ability is rather weak as well; its main method of attack is psychological, manipulating people\u2019s internal weakness to create an illusion and then take control of them.Combining He San and He Feng\u2019s experience as well as what happened earlier, Chen Ge came up with this hypothesis. The mirror monster was troublesome, but if Chen Ge could face it in person, then most of its power would be void. Therefore, if Chen Ge manage to lure the monster out of the protection of the mirror, everything would be easy.I need to figure out a plan. If possible I wish to take care of it tonight so that I\u2019ll be able to use this scenario tomorrow.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChen Ge was cool and collected. The monster inside the mirror was acting more and more wantonly, so if he did not deal with it soon, he would not be able to operate the Haunted House peacefully.Chen Ge hugged the four dolls in his arms as he left the Murder by Midnight scenario. He locked the door behind him before going to the Props Room. As he sewed the cuts back up, he tried to come up with a plan.The creature is highly aggressive and seems to have a curious interest in live humans. So the simplest way of luring it out of the mirror is to use a live human as bait.\u00a0Chen Ge was a master seamstress because he patched up most of the injuries in just a few minutes.But the real question is, after I\u2019ve lured it out, how do I kill it? Rumors say that ghosts are all afraid of salt and garlic, but must I risk my life to try out such hearsay?Chen Ge thought about it before deciding to log into the supernatural forums to ask the experts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Clicking on his account profile, he realized it was because the thirty-minute video that he had posted the other day had been shared, viewed, recommended, and commented at least several thousand times already. With a cursory glance, Chen Ge found nothing useful; most of them were there simply due to curiosity.Who knows, perhaps this might work, maybe there are experts hiding on the internet?\u00a0Chen Ge started writing a new thread to provide more information about the mirror monster and used the special power afforded Purple Accounts to open a bounty thread.\u201cAfter playing the game on the video, I realized I\u2019m now being haunted by the creature inside the mirror! Asking for help on how to remove this threat!\u201dThe replies came pouring in mere seconds later.\u201d\u00a0OP\u00a01\u00a0, you\u2019re still alive?\u201d\u201cA black dog\u2019s blood is the best solution, or rear a cock, legend says all the bad stuff are afraid of cocks.\u201d\u201cOP, listen to me and call this number.

To deal with her, he bought a gun, and when the female ghost returned that night, the man shot himself and later dragged the ghost into the bedroom to\u2026\u201d\u201cOP, serious though, listen to me, this method will definitely work! Go find an iron sword, preferably one that has tasted blood before. Ghosts are nothing but special magnetic energy, and such a sword will be able to harm them!\u201dChen Ge scrolled through the comments, and only the iron sword seemed somewhat plausible; the others were merely trolling or impossible to accomplish. He also knew about the traditional legends regarding the exorcism power of a black dog\u2019s blood and cocks, but where was he going to find such things in the middle of the night?After leaving the forum, Chen Ge tossed his phone to the side, spacing out as he sat in his chair. Combating the mirror monster meant putting his life on the line; he definitely could not rely on these half-baked online suggestions.After a roundabout detour, Chen Ge pulled out the black phone again. He knew he had to rely on the black phone because it was the only thing that was trustworthy. However, the black phone operated on the Law of Equivalent Exchange; to gain something, something of equal value had to be lost.After several days of trial and error, Chen Ge had gained some understanding regarding the hidden laws of the black phone, such as its mission reward structure. Easy and Normal Missions rewarded items that would supplement the operation of the Haunted House; only Nightmare Missions would provide rewards that were directly beneficial to Chen Ge, like special powers.In other words, to deal with the creature inside the mirror, completing Easy and Normal Missions were pointless; he needed the reward from the Nightmare Mission. However, Chen Ge was hesitant because he knew how dangerous Nightmare Mission; he could easily attract another dangerous specter on top of the mirror monster.What should I do? Take the stakes or wait a little while longer?It was then the Chen Ge realized it was already a new day, meaning the Daily Missions had been refreshed.Easy Mission: If you want to provide the visitors a scary experience, then first you have to pay notice to the rhythm and tempo of their experience in the Haunted House. Setting off the scare too early might cause the visitors to lose their interest, so it is suggested that you install some sound detectors or surveillance cameras in the Haunted House to keep track of your visitors\u2019 progress.Normal Mission: You\u2019ve achieved the criteria to enable the first expansion of the Haunted House. Search for a suitable location soon! Due to the current space limitation, you are unable to perform any Trial Missions to unlock scenarios!Nightmare Mission: There are weird sounds coming from the bathroom every midnight. If you want to know why, follow my directions.Daily Missions will refresh every day at midnight. User can only apply for one mission each day, and the reward corresponds to the difficulty of the mission.(Beware! The more difficult the mission, the more dangerous it\u2019ll be, so please choose carefully!)Chen Ge read the mission descriptions. Since he temporarily could not complete the Normal Mission, he skipped it. Thus, he was left with the choice of the Easy Mission or Nightmare Mission.When Uncle Xu gets me the money tomorrow morning, it should take less than a day to purchase all the necessary surveillance, but it\u2019ll take more than that to install it all. According to the description, the Nightmare Mission is related to the bathroom\u2026 it sounds creepy.Chen Ge was caught between a rock and a hard place. He was not confident that he could finish the Easy Mission, and even if he did, the reward would not be that great. However, the Nightmare Mission was too dangerous; after all, it all started inside the bathroom.He sat mired in his thoughts inside the Props Room. Before he came to a decision, the sound of sawing came again, this time, more distracting than before. Chen Ge titled his head back and was sure that the source was again the third floor.I\u2019ve already carried out all four of the dolls, what else is it cutting?\u00a0Chen Ge found the creature increasingly irksome. After putting the sewn dolls back into his pocket, he rushed up the stairs to the third floor holding his trusty hammer. When he arrived at the entrance to the Murder by Midnight scenario, he was shocked by what he saw.There were mirror pieces lying around the entrance, and there were scratch marks on the wooden door.The creature has been clawing at the door! What is it up to\u203dChen Ge\u2019s back was covered with cold sweat. He could imagine a monster holding the mirror pieces while running around the building when he was asleep. He would never allow such a dangerous existence to live under the same roof as him!Normally a nice guy, Chen Ge had sour expression at that moment. He locked the door to the Murder by Midnight scenario behind him and walked down the corridor, gripping the hammer. He stalked into every room to shatter every mirror he could find on the third floor. The sound of glass shattering echoed through the night. Chen Ge felt more like himself when he reached the end of the third-floor corridor.During the first Nightmare Mission, the creature was held back by the doll who sat before the mirror. When it was attacking He San, it had to retreat when Xiao Wan strode into the room. However, after assaulting He Feng, it gained the ability to leave the mirror! It\u2019s growing, and it\u2019s growing fast!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChen Ge knew he could not wait anymore. His Haunted House was finally on its way back, and he could not allow it to be ruined by an unknown creature.After leaving the scenario and locking the door once more, Chen Ge switched on the black phone to accept the Nightmare Mission with a do or die determination.\u00a0Hopefully the reward for this mission will be powerful enough.\u201cAre you sure you wish to accept the Nightmare Mission? After acceptance, unknown circumstances might occur.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe screen glowed, and the actual Nightmare Mission description started to surface.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Nightmare Mission this time is both a test and a reward!\u201cThe name of the game is \u2018Deep Water\u2019. It can allow you to bypass the line between the living and the dead, giving you the opportunity to see those who have unfortunately passed away.\u201cMission Requirement: Enter the bathroom alone at 3:30 am. Lock the door and turn off the lights. Fill up the tub with water and light a candle by the side before lying in it. The period between 3:30 and 3:40 am is the time of a day when Yin energy is most concentrated; it is also when the Yin and Yang cycle of the day converge. What you need to do is hold your breath at 3:44 am and submerge yourself under water, thinking about the name of the person you wish to meet the most.\u201cWhen time enters the twilight period between darkness and light, you\u2019ll be able to see them at the edge of living and dead.\u201cMission will be accomplished if you see said individual(s). If you do not, the mission will be automatically completed after holding your breath for sixty seconds.\u201dChen Ge had a complicated feeling after reading the mission description. Compared to the first Nightmare Mission, this mission seemed a lot simpler. Closing one\u2019s eyes for thirty minutes in a scary environment required superhuman courage and staunch constitution, but holding one\u2019s breath for sixty seconds seemed doable for most.However, it was exactly because it was doable by most that he was worried. This was a Nightmare Mission; it could not be that simple.Similar to the previous Nightmare Mission, the location is the bathroom, but the difference is that I\u2019m required to sink myself inside the bathtub and hold my breath for sixty seconds.He carefully studied every single step of the mission. Including the preparation time, at most, the mission would require fifteen minutes, what scary thing could possibly happen in such a short amount of time?Chen Ge was interested not only because the mission looked simpler but also due to a line among the mission description: \u201callow you to bypass the line between the living and the dead, giving you the opportunity to see those who have unfortunately passed away.\u201dDifferent from most, Chen Ge became calmer during periods of duress. He sat in his chair, contemplating the possibilities. His parents had disappeared in an abandoned countryside hospital, leaving behind nothing but a doll and the black phone. The black phone was activated when he was about to give up on the Haunted House. During the first Nightmare Mission, the doll became the thing that saved his life. So, the question worth pondering was, could the doll and the black phone have been purposely left behind by his parents to act as clues to their whereabouts?If that was true, then this second Nightmare Mission would be additionally interesting.Perhaps, they\u2019re trying to contact me through this method to provide me with more information?Of course, this was merely Chen Ge\u2019s speculation. To be perfectly honest, even if the Nightmare Mission was not a plan set up by his parents, Chen Ge would carry on with this mission.Allow you to bypass the line between the living and the dead, giving you the opportunity to see those who have unfortunately passed away.For Chen Ge, this was a chance to confirm once and for all whether his parents were still alive or not. If he did not see his parents, then it meant that they were merely missing and still alive. If he did see them, then it would validate Chen Ge\u2019s first speculation; his parents left the black phone behind for a purpose, probably as a channel to siphon information to him. Perhaps the black phone even contained his parents\u2019 actual last words.Looks like I have no choice.Chen Ge glanced at his watch. It was already 2:55 am; thirty-five minutes until the starting time of the mission.\u00a0I\u2019ve wasted too much time shattering those mirrors on the third floor; I\u2019ve got to hurry.The mission requirement was for him to lie in a bathtub filled with water, but the only bathroom with a bathtub was inside the Murder by Midnight scenario. One of the doors of the workers\u2019 passageway was connected to a bathroom with a bathtub. It was the trap door Chen Ge had been using to enter the scenario and to shuttle He San\u2019s group out of the scenario.There are only thirty-five minutes left. There isn\u2019t enough time to go look for a hotel with a bathtub, so it looks like I\u2019ll need to do this within the mirror monster\u2019s territory.Since the decision had been made, Chen Ge no longer hesitated. He carried the four dolls with him and exited the Haunted House in the middle of the night to head toward the park\u2019s canteen to grab two cleavers.Even though these haven\u2019t been used to slaughter pigs or sheep before, I did see the workers use them to prepare chicken and fish. I suppose you can consider them blades that have tasted blood before.Chen Ge placed the blades beside his nose to take a sniff. Instead of the expectant smell of bloodshed, all he could smell was the heavy scent of green chilies and onions, which caused his eyes to water.After returning to the Haunted House, Chen Ge ran between the fake bathroom and the toilet, carrying buckets of water. When it was ten minutes to the start of the mission, he finally managed to fill up the tub.Everything is ready; it\u2019s time to start.The Murder by Midnight scenario\u2019s front door was closed, and Chen Ge entered the bathroom from the workers\u2019 passageway. As demanded by the black phone, he was inside the bathroom alone. The mirror inside the bathroom had already been shattered by Chen Ge. The pieces made scrunching noises as his footsteps shuffled over them.It was quite noisy transporting the water, so the mirror monster should know about my presence by now, but that doesn\u2019t matter; I only need to hold my breath for one minute, and everything will be fine.From Chen Ge\u2019s perspective, the mission was weird but not that dangerous.He locked the bathroom\u2019s door from within and rested the doll left behind by his parents against the door. Then, he placed the four ragdolls that represented the lingering spirits of Ping An Apartments\u2019 victims around the bathtub.\u201cEveryone, I\u2019ll be depending on your help later. Please help me fight for that one minute!\u201dSimilar to before, he switched on his phone\u2019s recording camera and placed it on a suitable table to start the recording. However, the place was so dark that the screen was almost black, expect for a fuzzy human-shaped shadow.At the three-minute mark, Chen Ge removed the contents from his pockets and placed them on the counter. Following the black phone\u2019s instructions, he lit a candle and stuck it to the bathtub\u2019s rim. The dancing candlelight became the sole source of light in the room. Glancing downwards, Chen Ge saw his faces reflected in the many mirror pieces that littered the floor.He removed his shirt and took a step toward the bathroom. Ripples could be seen breaking the water\u2019s surface. The bathtub was shallow, but due to the dim lighting, Chen Ge found himself unable to see the bottom. Touching the water with his fingers, a chill ran up his arm and spread through his body, causing him to shiver.This mission sure is freaky.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter taking one last look at the time, Chen Ge stepped into the tub while holding the two cleavers. As he sat down, the water overflowed, drenching the mirror pieces.F*ck, it\u2019s cold\u2026Chen Ge could feel his body temperature dropping; even his heart rate had slowed. The bathroom was quiet except for the dripping sound of water that fell down from the edge of the bathtub.Just one minute, after this one minute, I\u2019ll have the reward, and the most important question on my mind will be answered!Chen Ge breathed in and out to control his heart rate, waiting for 3:44 am to arrive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He breathed in and out, circulating the air inside his lungs. The time noted on the black phone was precisely 3:42 am. He only had one chance, so he had to be careful.The room was quiet, and he could not hear anything from outside the corridor; the monster from the mirror did not seem to be around.Time ticked by. Chen Ge put the electronic watch he had brought purposely for this occasion on his side. When the digits changed to 3:43, he trained his focus and opened his mouth wide to slowly take in his breath.As the candlelight flickered, Chen Ge slowly submerged his body into the water. His eyes were glued to the electronic watch; he had never been so focused in his life before. When the digit changed again, Chen Ge slipped underneath the water surface without hesitation.It was finally 3:44 am!The icy water flooded him from all sides. Submerging oneself in a bathtub filled with water in the middle of the night, the experience was unique to say the least.The water numbed the senses, and it felt like there was nothing but darkness and oneself slowly falling into the abyss; there was complete silence other than the pounding of one\u2019s heart inside one\u2019s ears. The icy water pulled every sensory receptor in one\u2019s body taut.Lying inside the bathtub, Chen Ge abandoned all thoughts as he listened to his heartbeat and started the countdown.Sixty seconds, I only need to hold on for sixty seconds.This was the first time he had done something like this as well. The surface of the water seemed to merge with the darkness. The candlelight, which felt like it was going out, drifted away from Chen Ge like he was slowly falling into the ocean.One, two\u2026After the initial ten seconds, time seemed to have slowed down. The sound of water attempted to swallow even his heartbeat. All he could see was darkness. Chen Ge repeated his parents\u2019 names in his heart and held his pose with both his hands holding the cleavers and allowing his body to be carried along by the flow of the water.The oxygen in his lungs was fast depleting. Chen Ge was starting to feel uncomfortable, like something heavy was pressing down on his body.Fifteen, sixteen\u2026Every time his heart pumped, it exhausted the oxygen inside his lungs. As his heart slowed, so did the time; every second felt like an eternity. The feeling of discomfort intensified. It felt like a pair of hands was pressing down on his neck, slowly tightening around it.Chen Ge opened his eyes, but underneath the water, he was unable to see anything. It felt like he had travelled to another world and was trapped in it. Three or four seconds later, his face turned startlingly white.How long has it been? Should be over soon, right?Suddenly, there was a violent ripple that crossed the surface, and a weird sound crossed through the heavy silence. The sound seemed to come from the outside corridor. Chen Ge had no idea how he managed to hear it so clearly\u2026 perhaps it was something done on purpose to distract his focus.Footsteps? Someone is walking outside the corridor?His heartbeat, which had slowed, started to race, and his body tensed involuntarily.\u00a0That is probably the mirror monster. Hopefully the dolls will be able to hold it off for another thirty seconds for me to finish the mission!His brain slowed to a crawl, and a buzzing sound appeared in his ears. Chen Ge was not doing so well, and the footsteps from the corridor only made it worse. He tried his best to focus and continued to repeat his parents\u2019 names internally as he returned to counting his heartbeat.Twenty-eight, twenty-nine\u2026Chen Ge was unable to tell whether it was the water that had distorted the sound, but he swore the footsteps had begun to speed up, as if the opposite party was desperately trying to get into the bathroom.Several seconds later, Chen Ge felt like a heavy piece of boulder was falling on top of his chest. The blood vessels on his neck started to pop. His limbs were going weak with cold. His brain was slowing down, and only Chen Ge\u2019s determination was making him hold on.BANG! BANG! BANG!Something slammed into the bathroom door without warning. Chen Ge felt like his heart was in a vice; the thing outside the door had lost its patience!The opponent gave up after slamming the door a few more times. Perhaps it was the doll behind the door that had saved Chen Ge again. Silence returned to the room. Everything reverted to normal, or as normal as it could have been considering the circumstances. Normally, Chen Ge could easily hold his breath for a minute, but the footsteps from the corridor and the slamming on the doors had broken his composure. The degree of oxygen exhaustion increased when an animal was in distress.He knew he was reaching his limit. The last wisp of oxygen inside his lungs had been depleted. Every second was torment.Thirty-nine, forty\u2026When he counted to forty, Chen Ge\u2019s brain started to shut down. He had lost the ability to even keep the countdown going. If he allowed the little focus that he had left to waver, Chen Ge was sure he would drown. The sense of asphyxiation blotted out his thoughts, and all that remained in his head were his childhood memories with his parents.A vein was pulsing weakly on Chen Ge\u2019s neck, and his hands that held the cleavers started to relax. He felt himself drifting toward the edge of death, and it was not until then that he truly understood the meaning of that sentence inside the mission description.\u201cIt can allow you to bypass the line between the living and the dead, giving you the opportunity to see those who have unfortunately passed away.\u201dWhat it really meant was, as night changed into day, those on the brink of death could peer into the other world!Chen Ge stared unblinkingly at the surface of the water. His pupils were dilated, and it felt like he was pulling away from the surface. However, he could not see anything or anyone other than darkness, a darkness that was so quiet and yet filled with so much despair.The feeling of one\u2019s lungs being squeezed by an invisible hand was a sensation that could not be put into words.No, if I stay down here any longer, I really will die in this bathtub.He believed he had survived half a minute already, and the people that Chen Ge wanted to see had not appeared. He had given up hope, or rather, he was glad that his parents did not appear; this meant that they were still alive.His arms touched the cold surface of the bathtub\u2019s bottom. Using the last vestige of rationality, Chen Ge decided it was time to give up. His arms increased in strength to push himself out of the water when Chen Ge felt something was wrong!Something was pressing down on his head, stopping him from coming up to the surface. His dilated pupils focused to one point as Chen Ge looked up, but there was nothing there!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe dolls had sealed the door and the area surrounding the bathtub; the mirror monster should not have been able to come in, so who was behind this?More veins started to pop on Chen Ge\u2019s neck; his face was pretty much lifeless. At the very last minute, he used the last trace of energy in his body to grip the cleaver and wave it above his head.The extended period of oxygen deprivation had pushed his body and spirit to their limits; like a string pulled taut, they could snap at any moment.The cleaver cut through the surface, causing the water to splash all around. Chen Ge felt like he made contact with something, and he heard a crisp snap beside his ears before the mysterious force above his head suddenly disappeared.Without hindrance, Chen Ge sat up in the bathtub immediately, gasping for air as he broke the surface!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Lonelytree\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Millman97Chilling water slid down Chen Ge\u2019s hair. He was reeling from the fact that he had come so close to death. His chest was pumping unevenly, his lips turning from pale to purple, his hands still gripping the cleavers.He felt more collected two minutes later, and the light-headedness dissolved. Wiping the water droplets from his face, Chen Ge stood up unsteadily from the bathtub. With the weak light of the candle, he could see that nothing had changed inside the bathroom.I swear I managed to cut something earlier; there was that snap too.Chen Ge looked around him and saw a cut left on the edge of the tub.Did I accidentally cut the tub? That shouldn\u2019t be it; there was definitely someone holding my head down in the water earlier, and the cleaver should have cut that person.Desperate to know the truth, Chen Ge climbed out of the tub to grab the phone that was still recording. He stopped the recording and replayed it from the start.At 3:30 am, I sat inside the bathtub, and nothing happened on screen until 3:43 am.Chen Ge leaned against the wall as his eyes glued themselves to the screen. At 3:44 am, he lay down in the tub, causing the water to overflow.Looking at it from another perspective, this does look rather creepy.When he was doing this in person, Chen Ge did not feel like it was all that odd, but looking at it through the camera\u2019s lens, there was something chillingly bizarre about this.Chen Ge glanced at the time stamp. For the initial twenty seconds after he submerged himself, everything was normal inside the bathroom. There was the occasional sound of water dripping.Ten seconds later, Chen Ge frowned. The video that was playing on screen was showing a different reality than he remembered!Based on his memory, by then, the footsteps should have been heard from the corridor, but it was absolutely peaceful on the screen. The audio did not pick up anything weird, definitely no sound of footsteps. Five seconds later, the door slamming that Chen Ge remembered clearly also did not show up on-screen. All that was captured on the video was the darkened surface of the water and the dancing candlelight.The footsteps and door slamming were all parts of my hallucination?When fifty seconds had passed, the originally peaceful water surface was disturbed by a copious amount of air bubbles. It was obvious that the Chen Ge in the video was close to his limits. However, right then, something happened on the screen that made chills crawl all over Chen Ge\u2019s body.There was a piece of shattered mirror the size of a palm lying beside the bathtub. Its surface started to cloud over like it had been swallowed by a dark fog. Eventually, a black shadow slowly extended itself from it. It leaned against the tub; the scene was definitely supernatural. Based on its build and features, it looked like He Feng.The number of air bubbles started to increase, and the video was about to reach its climax. In the video, Chen Ge\u2019s body and mind were tested to their limits already, and he was about to give up. Chen Ge could see himself inside the tub moving upwards.However, just as his head was about to break the surface, the black shadow beside the tub suddenly reached out with both of its hands to press on his head!The shock caused water to stream into Chen Ge\u2019s nostrils, choking the man alive. Chen Ge struggled vehemently as the cleavers in his hands waved frantically above. The black shadow flickered like an image on an old television. The cleavers affected him but only slightly.At the most crucial moment, the ragdolls that were placed around the bathtub started to teeter like they were being blown by winds. The smallest among them tipped over and used its body to block the palm-sized mirror piece completely.The black shadow\u2019s body started to blur. It was then that Chen Ge\u2019s cleaver inadvertently made contact with its head, and the shadow disappeared. The cleaver flew out of Chen Ge\u2019s grasp, and before it landed on the floor, it scratched the edge of the bathtub, leaving a light mark. Almost at the same time, Chen Ge burst through the water surface.The video ended then. After knowing the truth, the desire within Chen Ge\u2019s heart to demolish that creature intensified.\u00a0The thing has to be vanquished!Chen Ge saved the video and picked up the ragdoll that was lying on top of the mirror. The small girl\u2019s back had been cut by the sharp edge of the mirror, and her body was drenched.They\u2019re both existence from the other side, but their personalities are completely different. Some of them are just in it for the scare, and they\u2019re good at heart, while others harbor nothing but malice.Chen Ge dried his body and put on his clothes. He placed all the dolls inside his pocket, and it was then that he felt better.Shattering the mirrors is useless. It can still crawl out of the mirror, so how am I supposed to deal with a creature like this? The thing can appear and disappear at will and can\u2019t be found; I\u2019m at a natural disadvantage dealing with things like this.Chen Ge picked up the palm-sized mirror out of curiosity, but he was shocked to realize the water droplets on it seemed to be moving with a will of their own. They trailed across the surface forming a number\u20143.Is this a taunt from the monster? Three, representing He San, He Feng, and myself? Or will it kill me within three days?Chen Ge had no clue what the number meant, but he was certain it wouldn\u2019t be anything good.\u00a0Then again, do you really think I am afraid of you? One of these days, I\u2019ll yank you out of the mirror and put you out in the sun to scorch you alive!Chen Ge came up with the worst curse he could think of. He had come so close to dying earlier.After taking another deep breath, Chen Ge went to pick up the black phone. He did not have much anticipation, but when he saw the message that appeared on screen, his eyes lit up.\u201cThe Specters\u2019 Favored, you managed to hold your breath for 62 seconds. Congratulations for completing the Nightmare Mission! Obtain the mission reward\u2014Yin Yang Vision.\u201cYin Yang Vision: See through the line that blurs between the two worlds. Use the Yang body to observe the Yin presence (A great upgrade to one\u2019s vision, other function currently unknown).\u201cNotice: You have completed two Nightmare Daily Missions. After completing the third Nightmare Mission, it will randomly unlock the Trial Mission for one of the scenarios!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cCompleted three consecutive missions with more than a 95 percent completion rate, unlocking new feature\u2014My Friends from the Other Side [Affection Status]!\u201dAfter reading through the series of messages, Chen Ge did not know what he should feel. The requirement of the Nightmare Mission was for him to hold his breath for sixty seconds. Due to the outside disturbance, he had already planned to surrender at around fifty or so seconds, and he would have failed the mission. However, the desire of the mirror monster to kill him had forced him to hold on for an additional few seconds, allowing him to complete the mission with a very close success.In a way, the appearance of the mirror monster was a blessing in disguise, because in the end, the result was positive.Chen Ge went through the black phone and realized how crucial this Nightmare Mission was. If he had failed the mission, not only would he not have earned the mission reward, the unlocking of the new scenario would have been delayed, and most importantly, the new function of the phone would not have been unlocked.Compelled by curiosity, Chen Ge clicked the new tab open. The interface changed, and five unfamiliar names appeared on screen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Completing the mission will greatly increase the affection level and will give you the power to get them to help you complete something that isn\u2019t against their will!\u201dThe new feature gave Chen Ge a deeper understanding of his \u2018friends\u2019. He removed the smallest doll from his pocket. This doll did not look that much different from the other dolls, at least physically, but the phone app had set her apart. She was the sole baleful specter among the family of lingering spirits.Something like you can be considered a baleful spirit?Chen Ge poked Xiaoxiao\u2019s cheek with his finger. Xiaoxiao, who was raised into the air, seemed to be a bit angry; she gave Chen Ge the impression of a little kitten who hadn\u2019t been weaned from milk, gnashing her teeth in a show of aggression!I suppose this is an accidental discovery.If Qin Xiaoxiao was the kind and gentle presence among the baleful specter, then Zhang Ya was the complete opposite. In fact, this was the first time Chen Ge had come across the term \u2018Red Specter\u2019.What exactly is the difference between a normal Baleful Specter and a Red Specter?Chen Ge tried to click on Zhang Ya\u2019s name, and the screen changed to reveal a blood-red interface.\u201cAre you sure you want to accept Zhang Ya\u2019s Bloody Heart Mission? Warning! This mission contains a certain level of danger!\u201dThe blood red interface caused cold sweat to appear all over Chen Ge\u2019s forehead.\u00a0But the phone says only specters with exceptionally deep malice and a dark history will be able to provide me with a Bloody Heart Mission. Am I that lucky? To be able to win such a \u2018prize\u2019 from my first draw?Actually, that was not the end of Chen Ge\u2019s thoughts on the matter. He thought to himself,\u00a0If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019d rather give up on such luck!However, afraid of how Zhang Ya might have reacted if she heard it, he kept it to himself.Crazy about me, but only after I\u2019m dead? If that\u2019s not twisted, I don\u2019t know what is!After exiting the app, the fear brought on by the mirror monster had completely disappeared. Compared to the \u2018prize\u2019 he had gotten from the Wheel of Misfortune, the shadow inside the mirror was nothing. However, this did not mean that Chen Ge would let it go. In contrast, Chen Ge had made it a threat that had to be removed no matter what. Only by removing it would the Haunted House be safe.Unlocking \u2018My Friends from the Other Side\u2019 provided Chen Ge with more options. From how he saw it, this feature was to set up the foundation for the Haunted House\u2019s spectral workers. As more features of the game got released, Chen Ge\u2019s interest in it increased.After gaining an understanding of the new feature, Chen Ge turned to inspect his second reward\u2014Yin Yang Vision.The reward from Nightmare Missions would provide him with a personal upgrade. Chen Ge tried to look into the distance, but other than the ability to see slightly clearer in the dark, this Yin Yang Vision did not seem to have any other uses.Perhaps this power requires a special environment to trigger just like Mortician\u2019s Make-up.Chen Ge picked up a random mirror fragment from the floor and put it before his face. Physically speaking, there was not any noticeable change to his pair of eyes; they were similar to before.From the description, Yin Yang Vision should grand me the ability to see stuff that normal people wouldn\u2019t be able to see, but\u2026Chen Ge raised Xiaoxiao to his eyes, but he saw nothing but a normal ragdoll.Am I using it wrong, or is there a specific method to using the power?Chen Ge came up with nothing after some more trials, so he decided to put it on the backburner for now. Working his limbs, which had gone numb, Chen Ge stretched inside the bathroom. Then, he sat down inside the bathroom to edit his latest video.I\u2019ve suffered so much. I wouldn\u2019t be able to face myself in the morning if I didn\u2019t share it with the world.He uploaded the original video onto the supernatural forum. It was 4 am, so Chen Ge didn\u2019t expect any responses. However, the moment the new video was released, there was already a new comment.\u201cHello, is this a game to attract ghosts? Lying inside the bathroom at midnight will call out the spirits?\u201dChen Ge glanced at the first comment and was shocked to realize it came from the forum moderator. He contemplated it for a while before adding the game rules and descriptions under the video and editing the name of the video to \u2018Why would someone voluntarily drown himself in his bathtub at home?\u2019Two minutes later, the comment floodgate had been opened. Chen Ge\u2019s account had garnered quite a following already on the forum. In fact, some of the users who were already asleep were woken up by their friends just to take a look at the video.\u201cLying inside a filled bathtub at 3.30 am alone\u2026 Even with the lights on, I wouldn\u2019t dare do that.\u201d\u201cThis new video seems to be even more supernatural than the previous one!\u201d\u201cWhat the f*ck is the shadow squatting beside the bathtub\u203d\u201d\u201cDid you hear anything or see anything out of the ordinary under the water? Boss, please reply!\u201d\u201cThe bathroom is the place with the heaviest Yin energy of the entire building, and the bathtub is a sort of hollow where Yin energy normally gathers. In Feng Shui, we call this \u2018\u6d3c(wa)\u2019. OP dares to play such a crazy game at a place like this, no wonder he stumbled across dirty stuff.\u201d\u201cTo linger at the line between life and death as the night changes into day\u2026 probably only a madman could come up with an idea like this, and only a madman would follow through with it.\u201dThere were a few informational replies on the forum. Chen Ge gave them a cursory read, and similar to before, he did not reply. Instead, he logged out to start editing the video footage.He cut out his final struggle at the end of the video, and the product he ended up with was 63 seconds long. For short videos, the best were those that were shorter but had more shock value.However, Chen Ge went against the grain this time. He uploaded a video that was 63 seconds long and named it \u2018One-Minute Holding Breath Challenge.\u2019Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter releasing the video, those who followed Chen Ge were notified, and some already commented without watching the video.\u201cBreath holding challenge? There\u2019s no scary video today?\u201d\u201cWhat is this? Even a drinking challenge would be more interesting than this!\u201d\u201cIs this some new challenge?

Heartless host, taste this piledriver from me!\u201dChen Ge was glad that his video had such a good reception even though it was 4 am. Feeling the \u2018love\u2019 his fans had for him, he realized everything was worth it. Before closing the video app, Chen Ge did not forget to put up an advertisement for his Haunted House. The fans were quick to respond, leaving messages saying they would visit him with some local delicacies.Buying tickets to visit the Haunted House and, on top of that, wanting to gift me local delicacies, the visitors today sure are nice.After Chen Ge exited the app, he felt much better. He stretched lazily once more and left the Murder by Midnight scenario, hugging the five dolls to his chest.The night soon passed, and dawn arrived. The sky outside the Haunted House started to brighten. Chen Ge found several wooden planks from the Props Room. He nailed them entrance and the trap door that was connected to the Murder by Midnight scenario. Before he dealt with the mirror monster, he did not plan to use that scenario.Twenty a ticket, and Murder by Midnight can fit seven visitors at one time. If one run is counted as fifteen minutes, I\u2019ll be able to gain a profit of 560 RMB per hour. One day\u2019s work is eight hours, so that translates to more than 4,000 RMB.The thought squeezed Chen Ge\u2019s heart with pain, but he was not blinded by greed.\u00a0Safety\u2019s first. There\u2019ll be more to earn after future scenarios are unlocked.After sealing up the scenario, Chen Ge returned to the staff breakroom. He placed the dolls beside his bed and changed into his running attire. The Trial Mission reminded Chen Ge of the fact that if not for his occasional training, he would have been buried under the ground then.Xu Wan arrived for work at around 8.40 am. She was surprised to see Chen Ge around the corner with his head full of sweat. In her mind, her boss was not someone who was into exercising.The gate of the Haunted House swung open, signifying the arrival of a new work day. The two workers stood at their assigned posts, ready to start the operation. At 9 am, the visitors started to enter the park, but the entrance of the Haunted House was still quite empty; it was the most vacant spot of all the attractions inside New Century Park.\u201cBoss, what did you do inside the Haunted House last night? Why are there water puddles all over the place?\u201d\u201cI was moping the floor.\u201d Chen Ge gave a random excuse before adding, \u201cWhen you are acting as a ghost, remember to stay far away from any mirrors.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dChen Ge was about to explain it to her when he saw Uncle Xu, the park manager, walking toward them.\u201cUncle Xu, is there a problem?\u201d Chen Ge removed the ear-mic. He realized Uncle Xu did not have a very pleased expression.\u201cYou are just getting weirder by the days.\u201d Uncle Xu studied Chen Ge up and down. \u201cJust now, the people from the canteen came to me to report that they are missing their cleavers. I was just wondering which thief would be so odd to only steal two cleavers. After looking at the surveillance, I have just one question to ask. Why weren\u2019t you asleep at night but snuck into the canteen to steal their cleavers? Is it that fun running around waving two cleavers?\u201dUncle Xu reminded Chen Ge that the cleavers he had taken from the canteen were still left inside the bathtub.\u201cI just helped the police solve an open case, right? But one of the killers is still missing, so the cleavers are for self-protection. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll buy the canteen new cleavers tomorrow.\u201dChen Ge had no clue whether blades that had touched a ghost before could still be used for culinary purposes, so he didn\u2019t think it was wise to return the cleavers to Uncle Xu.\u201cIt\u2019s getting harder and harder to understand you. Kid, tell me honestly. Are you involved in some illegal dealings behind my back?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of illegal dealings can I get into with two cleavers? I\u2019m not doing anything criminal, Uncle Xu, don\u2019t worry.\u201dUncle Xu was only half-convinced. However, since the park had just opened for the day, he had too many things to deal with to get into it with Chen Ge. He took a step closer to Chen Ge and pulled out a tightly wrapped plastic case from his pocket, \u201cHere is 5,000, if you have any trouble, please come to me.\u201d\u201cUncle Xu, thank you so much. I\u2019ll return you the money this weekend.\u201d\u201cJust stop making trouble for me, that\u2019ll be more than enough repayment.\u201dAfter Uncle Xu left, Chen Ge shoved the money inside his shirt. He leaned against the gate, thinking about how to utilize this money.5,000 should be just enough to install some cameras. However, the interior space of the Haunted House is now all occupied. I\u2019ll need to expand before I can unlock new scenarios. Renting the underground parking lot is not a bad idea, but I wonder how much the management will charge me.Chen Ge had a mounting headache from the many problems he realized he was facing.\u00a0The biggest problem I have is a lack of money! The reward money is still nowhere to be seen. Should I try to hurry them?He turned to look in the direction of the police station. When his gaze scanned a certain corner, his pupils narrowed, and his gaze centered on a curious visitor. The man was wearing a cap low on his head and a long-sleeved top with two hands stuck inside his pockets. He wandered between several attractions as if deciding which one he should try.That person looks so familiar.Due to Yin Yang Vision, Chen Ge\u2019s vision was better than most. The person probably did not know he had been exposed.Shall I go stop him?Just as Chen Ge was contemplating that, he had a group of visitors who wanted to visit the Haunted House. He threw himself into work, and the suspicious visitor was thus tossed out of his mind. When Xu Wan and Chen Ge were about to go for their lunch break, he once again spotted the suspicious man loitering near the Haunted House.The man hasn\u2019t come near the Haunted House the whole morning, but he came over just as me and Xu Wan are planning to go for lunch. What is he up to?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChen Ge had Xu Wan leave first. He returned to the Haunted House. When the visitor noticed his return, he turned around and left the park without even turning back.Have I seen him somewhere before?Chen Ge\u2019s eyelid twitched, a sign of a bad omen. Chen Ge decided to skip lunch and headed for the park security center. After getting the guard\u2019s permission, he went to search for this suspicious visitor\u2019s footage.It was quite obvious that the man was purposely avoiding the cameras. From his arrival to his departure, the man had kept his hands inside his pockets. Even when he stopped for a smoke break, he had only used one hand to light the cigarette that he kept dangled on his lips. However, the most suspicious part was that after paying for entry, he only rode one attraction. That was the Ferris Wheel, and he rode it three times in a row.This person is definitely suspicious!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Without saying a word, he pulled out his phone to call Inspector Lee\u2019s number at Western Jiujiang City\u2019s police station while standing in the security office.The phone rang twice before Inspector Lee\u2019s gravelly voice came through the line. \u201cHello?\u201d\u201cUncle San Bao, I need to report something to the police!\u201d\u201cOne, you\u2019ll need to call 110 for that.

Xiao Chen, why are you here and not at your Haunted House?\u201dHe glanced at the surveillance footage. When he saw the phone in Chen Ge\u2019s hand, he asked cautiously, \u201cWho were you on the phone with?\u201d\u201cThe police.\u201d Chen Ge did not turn to look at Uncle Xu as his eyes jumped between the many surveillance cameras. \u201cThey\u2019ll be here in another fifteen minutes.\u201d\u201cPolice\u203d Why didn\u2019t you discuss this with me first\u203d\u201d Uncle Xu\u2019s voice went up a pitch. \u201cThe park management has its own way of dealing with robberies, natural disaster\u2026\u201d\u201cUncle Xu.\u201d Chen Ge turned around to interrupt Uncle Xu. His eyes were incongruently calm and collected considering the words that fell out of his lips. \u201cSomeone is trying to kill me!\u201dWhen he announced that, the security room became silent, and all the guards whipped their heads around to look at him.\u201cChen Ge, have you been mentally affected from living inside the Haunted House for too long?\u201d Uncle Xu did not call him Xiao Chen like usual but used Chen Ge, which he reserved for serious occasions only. \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about in broad daylight\u203d\u201d\u201cI helped the police solve the arson case at Ping An Apartments, but one of the murderers is still on the loose.\u201dUncle Xu understood what Chen Ge was getting at then. \u201cYou mean that person is now inside the park and is out for revenge?\u201d\u201cI thought he would escape the region to hide, but who would have thought the man was so courageous?\u201d Chen Ge pointed at the man on screen. \u201cThis visitor is acting too strangely. His cap is too low, meaning he\u2019s trying to hide his face. Plus, today is not a cold day, but he\u2019s wearing a long sleeve shirt, and he kept his hands inside his pocket throughout. Even when he was smoking or drinking water, he only used his right hand, and he kept his left hand firmly inside the pocket.\u201d\u201cThat might be so, but none of that proves anything. Perhaps those are just his personal quirks?\u201d Uncle Xu put down the water bottle and walked to close the security room door.\u201cThe fugitive\u2019s name is Zhang Peng; his build is exact same as that of the man on screen.

The man is a down-on-his-luck gambler who has lost everything.\u201d\u201cMeaning he kept his left hand hidden because it would expose the tattoo?\u201d Uncle Xu was slowly convinced by Chen Ge\u2019s story. \u201cCould it be that the man has some weird skin disease that he doesn\u2019t want anyone to see?\u201d\u201cI have other proof.\u201d Chen Ge switched the video footage. \u201cAfter entering the park, he only visited one attraction, the Ferris Wheel, and he went on it three times in a row. Do you know what that represents?\u201d\u201cWhat does that represent?\u201d Uncle Xu was slowly lagging behind.\u201cThe Ferris Wheel provides the best vantage point of the park. He was trying to find the best escape route for himself.\u201d Chen Ge slowed down the footage. \u201cWhen Xu Wan and I left the Haunted House to go to the canteen, I saw him sneak toward the Haunted House. You can see from the video footage that he wandered around the Haunted House the whole morning but didn\u2019t approach it. He only did so after ensuring that Xu Wan and myself had left. This is definitely not the normal way a visitor would act.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Uncle Xu nodded, convinced by Chen Ge\u2019s argument. \u201cBut why would he go near the Haunted House only when no one is there?\u201dChen Ge tapped his fingers on the table. \u201cIf I were in his shoes, planning to kill the owner of a Haunted House, I would definitely stake out the place first to familiarize myself with the building\u2019s layout. Perhaps I could hide inside the Haunted House and wait for the place to close for maintenance, then I could jump at my target without him anticipating my arrival. Furthermore, a Haunted House is the perfect place to hide a body. If the blood stains are taken care of, when the body is discovered, it will most likely be the next day already.\u201dUncle Xu got chills listening to Chen Ge\u2019s speculation; there was a scene forming in his mind already. \u201cNow that you mention it, it is quite scary.\u201d\u201cThe scariest thing is that it almost happened!\u201d Chen Ge pulled his gaze back, and his balled fists slowly relaxed. \u201cThankfully, he has acted too rashly. Plus, my senses have been maintained at an all-time high due to the many weird events that have been happening; that\u2019s the only reason I managed to spot him.\u201d\u201cThen, where is he now? Shall I alert the other visitors?\u201d Uncle Xu finally understood the gravity of the situation.\u201cHe has already left the park after he was discovered. At the time, I still hadn\u2019t seen the footage, so I was not confident with my speculation; that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t stop him.\u201d\u201cYou did well. If the suspect went berserk inside the park, it would have caused great chaos.\u201d Uncle Xu took a sip of the water and told the guards beside him, \u201cRemember to cooperate with the police when they arrive later.\u201dTen minutes later, the door to the security room was pushed open. Three men in casual attire strode into the room; the one leading was Lee Sanbao. \u201cWhere\u2019s Chen Ge? Let me see your surveillance footage.\u201dWith the aid of the guards, Inspector Lee compared the man in the video to the police station\u2019s database and finally managed to confirm the two were one and the same!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cKid, you\u2019ve done society another great service!\u201d Inspector Lee smacked Chen Ge on his back before pulling out his phone to contact the station to report on the situation. After some discussion, they decided to split into two teams, one was going to conduct a secret investigation while the other would surround New Century Park and observe from afar.\u201cZhang Peng is an extremely dangerous individual. You have to be careful since you\u2019re being targeted. The probability of him coming back is very high, so I suggest you stay away from the Haunted House for the time being.\u201dAfter hearing what Inspector Lee had to say, all the guards felt uneasy. Chen Ge, however, was surprisingly unfazed. \u201cIf I\u2019m not there, Xiao Wan alone won\u2019t be able to keep the Haunted House open. If I close the Haunted House, Zhang Peng will definitely know that gig is up; he\u2019ll go on the run then.\u201d\u201cYou mean, you\u2019re planning to stay at the Haunted House as bait?\u201d Inspector Lee frowned slightly, thinking this plan was far too dangerous.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, if he dares come inside my Haunted House, I guarantee he won\u2019t be leaving anytime soon.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This way, he\u2019ll follow through his plan to seek me out. When he returns to the park, you will be able to detain him,\u201d Chen Ge explained after much contemplation. \u201cIf we fail to catch him this time, I\u2019ll need to spend the rest of my life in fear, looking over my shoulder every moment, since he could strike at any given time.\u201d\u201cIn any case, the actual plan will have to be decided only after we discuss it with the city\u2019s investigation team. The case at Ping An Apartments is their responsibility; we from the western station are merely providing assistance, but I will relay your request to them.\u201d Inspector Lee packed up his laptop and made a call before leaving the security room with the two other officers.Uncle Xu wandered over after the police left. He was worried about Chen Ge. \u201cXiao Chen, I think you should listen to the police and go find somewhere else other than the Haunted House to stay for a few days.\u201d\u201cHiding from the problem is not going to solve anything, but I appreciate the concern, Uncle Xu.\u201dAfter taking another look at the surveillance, Chen Ge returned to the Haunted House.Xu Wan was leaning against the gate, and when she saw Chen Ge walk toward her from the security office, she pointed at the boxed rice left on the table. \u201cBoss, today\u2019s menu is stir-fry green chili with pork and rice. When the canteen auntie wasn\u2019t paying attention, I added another scoop of meat for you.\u201dChen Ge thanked Xiao Wan for the rice. He looked at the girl but decided not to reveal any information about Zhang Peng. He finished the rice with big mouthfuls and began the afternoon service. Xu Wan acted as the ghost inside the Minghun scenario while Chen Ge stayed at the entrance to sell tickets. He kept his head low, but his eyes swept every corner of the park.Zhang Peng\u2019s appearance can be a curse or a blessing depending on how I use him.After completing several missions on the black phone, Chen Ge\u2019s logical thinking had improved tremendously, and his tolerance for stress had been given a power up.There\u2019s a mirror monster hiding inside the Haunted House currently. The thing can pass through the mirror world and reality freely. In other words, if there\u2019s a mirror, it is invincible.\u00a0Chen Ge sold the ticket mechanically while his brain worked on overdrive to process the information.\u00a0The attacks on He San and He Feng were very similar. Based on He Feng\u2019s description, the monster\u2019s aim was to possess their body and swap out their consciousness. Temporarily, we have no idea what the purpose of that is, but one thing worth considering is, if the monster enters a person\u2019s body, does that mean that it won\u2019t be able to escape the body at least for a short period of time?Chen Ge had discovered this phenomenon when he conversed with He Feng, but there was no danger-free method to test out this theory. He had prepared to give up on this idea, but then Zhang Peng had decided to show himself that morning.When he confirmed it was Zhang Peng on the camera, the plan had been settled in Chen Ge\u2019s mind. He planned to use Zhang Peng as bait. He had to figure out a way to lure Zhang Peng inside the Haunted House and enable the mirror monster to possess his body.This way, he could kill two birds with one stone. It was also why he insisted on staying at the Haunted House.This is the plan. It\u2019s dangerous, but if it\u2019s successful, I\u2019ll be able to remove two threats at once.At 5 pm, Chen Ge called Xu Wan out and let her leave early. He went back inside the Haunted House to prepare various stuff for Zhang Peng. At 5.30 pm, Chen Ge received a call from Inspector Lee, telling him that the police had set up a perimeter around New Century Park. If Zhang Peng showed himself, he would definitely not get away. After dinner, Chen Ge carried Doctor Skull-cracker\u2019s outfit and hammer as he entered the Haunted House\u2019s main control room. He locked the door and sat before the monitors. If there was no accident, he was going to spend the whole night inside the room.There are indeed too few cameras. There are too many blind spots, so I mustn\u2019t let my guard down.The sun dipped below the horizon, and as daylight left, New Century Park felt weirdly eerie. Chen Ge wrapped the outfit around him as a cover as he sat inside the control room. At midnight, those who should not be there had arrived, but those who should have been there had not.Similar to the previous night, the sound of sawing came from the Murder by Midnight scenario.Is the creature taunting me?\u00a0Chen Ge shrugged the outfit off and walked to the door, wondering if he should go meet the creature.\u00a0I\u2019ll let it be for now.Putting back on the ear-mic, Chen Ge hugged the doll left behind by his parents to his chest and returned to the surveillance monitor.At around 1 am, when Chen Ge was at the verge of giving up, he saw the door to the bathroom rattle on screen.Someone\u2019s there?He focused on the monitor, completely rejuvenated. Not long after, the door fell open a sliver and a lanky man wielding a twenty-centimeter-long boning knife slipped through the opening.That bathroom is where I did my first Nightmare Mission. The window leads outside. He probably prepared some stepping stone beforehand and messed with the lock earlier.Chen Ge looked at the surveillance calmly. The door to the control room was still locked. The control room\u2019s location was well-hidden, and those unfamiliar with the Haunted House\u2019s layout would not be able to reach it anytime soon.On screen, Zhang Peng travelled down the corridor, holding the knife in one hand and his phone in another. He had no idea he was being watched as he focused on side-stepping the random stuff and unknown props that littered the corridor.After fifteen minutes traversing the obstacle course, Zhang Peng finally reached the staff breakroom. He could be seen hesitating at the door. His chest rose and fell unevenly, and his hand that held the knife shivered. He reached out to push on the door multiple times, but every time, he pulled back just before his finger touched the door. It was obvious that he was caught in a conundrum.Zhang Peng dithered for about twenty seconds before he came to a decision. He did not even notice the camera that was looking at him.He raised the knife in one hand while the other grabbed the door knob. With a deep breath, he shoved the door open, and like a leopard pouncing on its prey, he jumped into the breakroom!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOne minute later, Zhang Peng came out carrying the knife. There was a bit of red on the blade, he seemed to have accidentally slashed his arm. He tossed the knife to his other hand. Zhang Peng\u2019s expression turned more grievous. He glanced at the stairs before picking up the pace as he went down the corridor.From the surveillance feed, Chen Ge could see Zhang Peng was heading toward the control room. Chen Ge messaged Inspector Lee and held Doctor Skull-cracker\u2019s hammer as he hid behind the door.He was about to surprise Zhang Peng with a horror movie classic\u2014the scare behind the door\u2014but Zhang Peng merely wandered past the control room\u2019s door before heading into the workers\u2019 passageway.What is this man up to?\u00a0Chen Ge was confused by his opponent\u2019s actions. He hurried to the monitor and saw that Zhang Peng was using his knife to pry off the wooden planks that had sealed up the trap door at the end of passageway before heading in without a second thought.Why is he heading into the Murder by Midnight scenario?\u00a0Chen Ge peeled off his ear-mic as his eyes widened with shock.\u00a0There have been sawing sounds coming out from the scenario\u2026 does he think I\u2019m sawing stuff inside?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I have to see the mirror monster enter Zhang Peng\u2019s body with my own eyes before I can sleep easy at night.With a glance at the surveillance to pinpoint Zhang Peng\u2019s location, Chen Ge yanked out the chains from the Doctor Skull-cracker outfit and dropped them to the floor before putting both the outfit and the skin mask on. He waved the iron hammer twice to get a feel for it, and a wicked energy radiated from Chen Ge.How come it feels like I\u2019m the bad guy here?After grabbing his keys and phone, he shoved the dolls into his pocket, grabbed hold of the weirdly-designed hammer, and headed out of the control room.\u2026Trapped inside the Murder by Midnight scenario, Zhang Peng felt the weight of the knife in his hand getting heavier. He had prepared for this day for a long time, but one could never prepare enough because accidents had already happened.It was already 1 am, and a normal person would be asleep already. Even if they were not, they would be resting in their bedroom. He was all sorts of excited when he saw the sign that pointed to the staff breakroom. It had taken him a long time before he managed to calm down.He had given himself plenty of pep talk, to arouse the hatred and resentment within himself before he gathered enough courage to blast through the door. As he did so, he had waved the knife fiendishly at the bed. He had been so caught in the motion that he did not notice he had slashed himself.The blade was tipped with blood, but there was no one inside the bed. The only blood stain on the ruined bedspread came from his arm. Other than resentment, there was now an additional stain of grievance; it fueled his murderous intent, eclipsing his rationality completely.Ruining Ping An Apartments, sending Juan Er into jail. You despicable bastard, I swear I\u2019ll kill you if it\u2019s the last thing I do!The more Zhang Peng thought about it, the angrier he became. The sawing sound from upstairs was like flies, causing his emotions to rile up even more.He gripped his knife tightly as he wandered close to the source. To prevent being found out, he was extremely careful along the way.I\u2019m close; the source is from this floor!Zhang Peng poked his head out from the stairs. He did not carry any light source with him. He kept his back to the wall as he entered the third-floor corridor.I say, this Haunted House sure is creepy; the corridors are as complicated as a maze. After I kill him, even if I just drop his body inside a random room, it\u2019ll take at least half a month before he\u2019s discovered.His lips curled up into a cruel smirk.The sound is coming from in front! But what is the man up to, not sleeping so late at night but sawing stuff? Fixing some emergency props?Zhang Peng bent down. He used the long sleeves to cover his wound as he crawled forward with the point of the knife leading the way forward.At the end of the third-floor corridor, the entrance to the scenario, Zhang Peng saw a blurry black shadow. The shadow was standing in the middle of the door, holding something in his hand, scratching on the door.Weird, why didn\u2019t he turn on the lights?It was not until he was so close that Zhang Peng realized this incongruity. However, he did not dwell on it because his mind was soon swallowed up by the desire for revenge. The air seemed to have frozen around him. He slowly raised the knife above his shoulder. His body was as tense as a strung bow, and he charged forward to stab at the shadow.\u201cGo to hell!\u201dThe full speed sprint sent Zhang Peng and the knife crashing into the shadow!An excited smile had begun to appear on his face, but it only lasted for 0.2 seconds before it disappeared. The knife shot through the shadow directly!The inertia caused Zhang Peng to slam into the door headfirst, and he almost broke his waist from the impact.\u201cWhat the f*ck\u203d\u201d Zhang Peng was unable to accept this result. He climbed up from the floor in a hurry and waved the knife frantically around him. \u201cWhere is he? Where is he\u203d\u201dAfter his anger left him, a sensation that he had not experienced before started to grow within Zhang Peng\u2019s heart.I swear I saw a black shadow standing here! My eyes weren\u2019t mistaken!Zhang Peng no longer cared about hiding his tracks. He pulled out his phone to light up his surroundings. The door was crisscrossed with scratch marks, and several sharp mirror pieces littered the ground.This was all left behind by the dark shadow, so I was right, there was someone standing here earlier!So, where in the world did he go\u203dZhang Peng shivered from head to toe. His anger had been completely drenched as he looked fearfully down the darkened corridor that suddenly felt so eerie.A man can\u2019t just disappear from thin air, unless\u2026 that wasn\u2019t a normal man.His Adam\u2019s Apple wiggled, and the weak light from the phone could no longer bring him a sense of security. If anything, the weak light only heightened his fear, like there were monsters hiding in the corners where the light could not reach.The Haunted House\u2019s owner isn\u2019t a living person! This Haunted House is really haunted!Zhang Peng\u2019s forehead was covered in cold sweat. Even his hand that gripped the knife was soaked with sweat. Any thought of revenge and murder had completely left his mind. He dashed down the corridor hurriedly; all he had on his mind then was to escape this blasted place.In his hurry to escape, he did not notice the angle of the staircase door was different from how he had left it before.Revenge can be re-planned after I leave this place.Holding his wounded arm, Zhang Peng jumped into the staircase, when a shadow flitted out from behind the door and assaulted him.The sound of bone cracking was crisp to the ear. Zhang Peng held his right arm that seemed to be dying, and his brain went into shutdown.\u201cSorry, I missed.\u201d Chen Ge wandered out from behind the door. The creepy skin mask twisted with a display of myriad expressions as Chen Ge\u2019s lips moved. \u201cI was aiming for your shoulder blade.\u201dChen Ge\u2019s tone was indifferent, like he was talking about the weather. Looking at Chen Ge, Zhang Peng felt like he was about to suffocate.\u00a0Jesus, Buddha, Allah, someone please help me!Zhang Peng did try to resist, but when he saw the forty-centimeter-long hammer in Chen Ge\u2019s hands, his limbs refused to listen to his commands.\u00a0The hammer is covered with blood, and the handle has the shape of a human spine! Are you that afraid people won\u2019t know that you\u2019re a mad murderer\u203dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWithout giving his opponent much time to recover, Chen Ge picked up the hammer and swung it at Zhang Peng\u2019s leg. He needed someone who was completely defenseless to be the vessel for the mirror monster.Bang!The bars on the stairs curved from impact. Zhang Peng evaded the attack at the last minute. With one arm bleeding and another incapacitated, Zhang Peng had given up on resistance. He even dropped his knife as he ran down the stairs.\u201cYou dare visit my Haunted House with such lack of courage\u203d\u201dGrabbing the iron hammer, Chen Ge gave chase after his prey as the two of them returned to the first floor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The layout of the Haunted House was complicated, and combined with the lack of lighting, several minutes later, he soon realized with a sinking heart that he was lost.\u201cWhy are you stopping? Don\u2019t be afraid, I won\u2019t hurt you; I just want to do a small experiment on you.\u201d With both of his hands on the iron hammer, Chen Ge trailed behind Zhang Peng, slowly leading his prey into a dead-end.\u201cNot going to harm me? The moment we met, you cracked my arm! That is what you called not going to harm me\u203d\u201d Zhang Peng had lost his only weapon; his left arm was bleeding; his right arm was limp, hanging off his shoulder like a noodle. In that moment, he felt wronged, and the thought to call the police for help appeared in his mind.\u201cListen to my advice\u2014stop struggling and follow my orders, or you might need a wheelchair for the rest of your life.\u201d Chen Ge took deliberate steps toward Zhang Peng. He had no pity for the man; after all, Zhang Peng was there to kill him. If he had not discovered that sooner, he would have been dead already.\u201cBoss, does that sound like what a victim would say? I must have been jinxed!\u201d Zhang Peng was completely defenseless, so he ran down whatever open path he could find.\u201cThat pair of legs sure know how to run\u2026\u201d Chen Ge continued to chase after Zhang Peng. However, several steps later, a sawing noise appeared in Chen Ge\u2019s ears again as a black shadow shot out from the workers\u2019 passageway!The mirror monster must have understood what was really happening by then; it knew this was the perfect opportunity. Zhang Peng raced blindly around the first floor. When he turned a corner, he saw a figure of a man waving at him from the corner of his eyes. Perhaps he was too scared by Chen Ge because he ran toward that person without a second thought.Chen Ge, who followed behind Zhang Peng, saw this, and a chill ran down his spine. The figure was around the same build as He Feng; it was the mirror monster!\u201cI want you to live, but you insist on dying; that\u2019s a real ghost!\u201d Chen Ge\u2019s warning fell on deaf ears. Zhang Peng had reached the end of the corridor, and with the guidance of the figure, he wandered into the bathroom.The mirrors in the first-floor bathroom are in pristine condition. Since it\u2019s leading Zhang Peng toward the bathroom, the monster is going to make its move soon!Chen Ge was feeling nervous since the crucial moment had arrived. He dashed to the bathroom and worked with the doorknob. It was then that he realized the door was locked.The development had strayed from his plan. The sudden appearance of the black shadow had ruined everything. It had managed to capture Zhang Peng before Chen Ge could detain the man.\u201d\u00a0Ahhh!\u00a0\u201dSeveral seconds later, an ear-splitting scream came out from behind the bathroom door. Then it was followed by the sound of stuff falling and crashing. Zhang Peng seemed to have stumbled across something really scary.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in there?\u201d Chen Ge raised the hammer to crack down on the doorknob. The doorknob fell off, but the door still would not budge. Someone had used the cupboard to block the door from behind it. Unable to know what was happening inside the bathroom, Chen Ge was anxious as he swung the hammer repeatedly at the wooden door.Bang! Bang! Bang!The loud noises could be heard even outside the Haunted House. Chen Ge had depleted most of his energy before he managed to break the hollow wooden door. The cupboard behind it had started to budge to reveal an opening that was about half a palm wide.Looking through the opening, Chen Ge saw the black cloth that covered the mirror had fallen to the floor. Zhang Peng was staring at the mirror with his eyes unfocused, but the scariest thing was\u2026 there was a large black shadow standing between him and the mirror!The black shadow was slowly morphing until it became almost like Zhang Peng. It took one step back to allow half of its body to melt into the mirror, and then the weirdest thing happened.The dazed Zhang Peng walked toward the mirror. He pressed his face against the surface of the mirror. His body and the black shadow were slowly merging. About four seconds later, a creepy grin appeared on Zhang Peng\u2019s blank face!He slowly turned around and made sure to hold Chen Ge\u2019s gaze through the door and the cupboard. He swiped some fresh blood off his arm and wrote down something on the surface of the mirror.Another one or two seconds later, spirit seemed to return to Zhang Peng\u2019s eyes. He shuddered visibly before jumping out the bathroom window and out of the Haunted House.The mirror monster has escaped into Zhang Peng\u2019s body? But does that thing have such a deep resentment toward me? Could it be because I\u2019ve ruined its plan multiple times?The mirror monster had assaulted both He San and He Feng. Both times, it had been interrupted due to an external influence; that was probably why the monster harbored resentment toward the owner of the Haunted House, Chen Ge.The door to the bathroom was still blocked, and it would stay blocked for a quite some time. Chen Ge quickly rushed to the front door, but before he could get anywhere, he could hear Inspector Lee\u2019s voice calling.\u201cChen Ge! Hang in there! We\u2019re coming to get you!\u201d Following a loud bang, the Haunted House\u2019s gate was pried off its hinges, and several officers streamed into the building. Seeing this, Chen Ge immediately tossed the iron hammer to the side and removed his outfit and mask.The sound of footsteps echoed down the corridor. Inspector Lee was the first one to burst through the darkness. Seeing Chen Ge standing all alone in the corridor, he asked with concern, \u201cXiao Chen, are you hurt?\u201dChen Ge played into the skit as he staggered a step back and leaned \u2018weakly\u2019 against the wall. He had his hand on his chest as he said, \u201cI was shocked, but I wasn\u2019t hurt. Leave me be, go chase after Zhang Peng! I saw him jump out of the Haunted House\u2019s bathroom window!\u201d\u201cOkay, leave the rest to us. Thank you for your help tonight!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. To be able to help the law enforcement is my honor, what is a little risk or sacrifice?\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019d better not act so rashly anymore in the future\u2014just look at how dangerous it was tonight!\u201d Inspector Lee\u2019s eyes were aglow with admiration and approval. He had his men chase after Zhang Peng while he stayed behind with Chen Ge inside the Haunted House to examine the crime scene.He wandered into the staff breakroom first. When he saw the blood on the bed, he turned to Chen Ge with worry. \u201cXiao Chen, you\u2019re injured? Let me see!\u201d\u201cThat isn\u2019t mine\u2026\u201d Chen Ge also didn\u2019t how to explain it. \u201cAt the time, the room was dark. The suspect probably accidentally hurt himself.\u201dInspector Lee nodded. He used his flashlight to examine the knife marks on the bed frame and bedsheet, and his expression darkened. \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong. A man who is not familiar with knife work would accidentally slash himself in extreme stressful situations.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe counted the visible marks and concluded, \u201c17 slashes in total! This is more than enough to pin him with attempted murder; this is the best proof!\u201dLooking at the knife marks, Chen Ge also felt a chill run up his arms.Inspector Lee pulled on his gloves and signaled for Chen Ge to vacate the room. \u201cRemember to not touch anything in this room. Later, people will come to take pictures to keep as evidence.\u201d\u201cOf course, I will provide my full cooperation.\u201dChen Ge retreated out of the room and returned to where he had been earlier to hide the iron mallet before walking to the first-floor bathroom. He stood before the ruined door and wondered to himself,\u00a0If I\u2019m not mistaken, Zhang Peng wrote something on the mirror, right?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After the black shadow left last night, I saw a\u00a03\u00a0on the shattered mirror and now it has become\u00a02\u00a0; is there some kind of relationship between them? Why is the number decreasing?\u00a0Chen Ge was at a loss.\u00a0Could they represent some kind of countdown?Looking at the drying blood stain, Chen Ge leaned against the door and started to contemplate.The mirror monster has already entered Zhang Peng\u2019s body, so there was no reason for it to leave this message behind unless it plans to come back for revenge.Chen Ge considered this possibility, but he couldn\u2019t confirm it; he knew too little about the other world and the mirror monster.Suppose the number continues to drop, what will happen when it reaches zero?A bad feeling rose within Chen Ge\u2019s heart as he paced around the entrance of the bathroom.\u00a0Could the number be related to my life? When it reaches zero, my life will be over like those tropes in scary movies?Chen Ge stopped himself from overthinking.\u00a0I suppose there\u2019s nothing else for me to do for now but wait for tomorrow night to arrive. If there\u2019s another number that appears around or within the Haunted House, then I\u2019ll decide what to do.Chen Ge sighed deeply. All he ever wanted was to keep the Haunted House his parents left for him alive, and if it was within his means, he hoped to improve it, but there just had to be these accidents that screwed with his plan.When he returned to the staff breakroom, several police cars had arrived outside the Haunted House. The main city\u2019s investigation team had come to ask Chen Ge some questions and snap a few pictures of the crime scene before joining the others to pursue and capture Zhang Peng.Inspector Lee accompanied Chen Ge, but even when the sun climbed up over the horizon, there was still no news of Zhang Peng being captured. However, Inspector Lee promised Chen Ge multiple times that with the condition Zhang Peng was in, he would not be able to avoid capture for long; he would be caught within the next 24 hours.Honestly, Chen Ge was not that worried about Zhang Peng. He was feeling down because he was concerned about the number that had been left behind by the mirror monster. Inspector Lee thought that Chen Ge was reeling from trauma, so he consoled him as best he could before leaving with the other officers after daylight.Chen Ge was left alone in the Haunted House. He opened the window to allow the morning draft to caress his face.I\u2019m the owner of a Haunted House, the lord of ghosts and spirits so to speak, but how come I feel I am so pitiful?The morning rays filtered into the room. The ragdoll left on the bed turned as if carried by the wind and fell underneath the bed.Chen Ge picked it up and poked it on its tummy. \u201cThe only specter who listens to me only knows how to act cute. In a real combat situation, I\u2019ll probably need to protect you.\u201dThe ragdoll seemed to be unhappy with Chen Ge\u2019s evaluation of her. She tried to resist but could not do anything.The rewards from both Nightmare Missions were support skills; they are useful for the development of the Haunted House but don\u2019t really help me personally much.Even though Chen Ge had no idea what the numbers meant, he refused to let himself be toyed with by some mysterious forces like that.Taking out the black phone, Chen Ge clicked through the app for a long time and realized his only trump card was the scary-looking Red Specter\u2014Zhang Ya. When he was at the wooden hut behind Ping An Apartments, Zhang Ya had helped him once, tipping him to Wang Qi\u2019s presence. Technically, she had saved his life.However, during the Nightmare Mission, when the mirror monster tried to drown him in the bathtub, she had not appeared. This went to show how cavalier she was with Chen Ge\u2019s life.Completing her Bloody Heart Mission will enable me to get her to do something that is not against her will. Maybe I\u2019ll be able to get her to help me deal with the imminent danger.Chen Ge clicked on Zhang Ya\u2019s name, and even his courage that had been cultivated from a young age started to waver as he looked at the bloody red interface.\u00a0But this lady likes a dead Chen Ge, what if the affection level rises too fast and she can\u2019t wait for me to join her in the afterlife?Not everyone could accept a specter\u2019s admiration that easily. After exiting the app, even the air around Chen Ge felt fresher.\u00a0The Bloody Heart Mission will be my final resort. If the mysterious number appears one more time tonight, I\u2019ll have to complete the Bloody Heart Mission.After making that decision, with a plan forming in his mind, Chen Ge fell back to sleep.Xu Wan came to work at around 8 am. Chen Ge left the Haunted House in her capable hands while he went to purchase the surveillance cameras with Uncle Xu\u2019s money. He was in such a hurry because there were too many blind spots around the Haunted House; it was too dangerous. On top of that, one of the black phone\u2019s Daily Missions was for him to install surveillance cameras and security devices.After the purchase was made, Chen Ge had the workers come to the Haunted House that afternoon to install the devices. With him personally watching, the few workers installed the cameras in most corners of the Haunted House with their hearts shaking, forming a surveillance web that had few blind spots. Even though Chen Ge planned to purchase listening device as well, due to limited funds, he only got the cheapest one and had it installed inside the Minghun scenario.At 7 pm, after the final testing was done, Chen Ge received the mission success alert on the black phone.\u201cCongratulation for completing the Easy Mission, reward earned\u2014Background Music, Wedding Dress!\u201cNote: Wedding Dress is the perfect accompaniment to Minghun! The Minghun scenario\u2019s Scream Factor has been upgraded to 1 Star!\u201dChen Ge was surprised when he saw the phone alert. The original Scream Factor for Minghun was only 0.5 Stars, but with this new music, it was upgraded to 1 Star.Looks like this music is even more disturbing than Black Friday.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWanting to immediately try it out, Chen Ge played the music. It was a completely different style from Black Friday. One was a slow insidious burn, like a force slowly dragging the listener into the dark abyss; the other was weirder in nature, a mix of wedding music and funeral music. The new track caused Chen Ge\u2019s skin to crawl from the first note alone.It does fit the Minghun scenario perfectly, but constant exposure to it will probably cause unwanted psychological trauma. Unless someone comes to challenge the Haunted House, I\u2019d better keep it to myself for now.Chen Ge saved Wedding Dress to his own phone before returning to the third floor alone to clean up the place.He did not have enough funds to hire cleaners, so with the dolls snuggled in his pockets, he cleared out all the mirror pieces he could find on the third floor. When he was done, it was almost midnight. Chen Ge held his phone as he wandered between the bathroom and the staff breakroom.He looked at the mirrors carefully as he waited for midnight to arrive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Afraid that he might miss out on some details, Chen Ge did not dare to blink with his palms on the sink and his face close to the mirror.He focused all of his attention on the mirror. When there were only several seconds away to midnight, the phone in Chen Ge\u2019s pocket vibrated.A call? Who would call at such a time?The sudden phone call startled Chen Ge. He hurriedly pulled out his phone and the caller ID was Inspector Lee.Has there been some kind of accident?Chen Ge answered the call and put the phone beside his ear. \u201cUncle San Bao, have you got an update?\u201dOn the other end of the phone, Inspector Lee sounded serious and hurried. \u201cZhang Peng is still on the loose, but we\u2019ve come to the conclusion that he\u2019s still around western Jiujiang! You have to be careful! The man is incredibly dangerous and cunning. His actions and thinking are different from normal, and we cannot rule out the possibility that he will return for you!\u201d\u201cBut didn\u2019t the police set up a perimeter around New Century Park yesterday? With injuries on both of his arms, he shouldn\u2019t have been able to get far.\u201d From Chen Ge\u2019s perspective, he had been sure Zhang Peng was going to be captured.\u201cThere was an unexpected development. For now, I cannot give you the details, but what I can say is, last night, one of the officers who managed to intercept the suspect experienced some kind of trauma. He\u2019s currently in a deep coma and being looked after at the hospital.\u201d\u201cWhat\u203d\u201d Chen Ge\u2019s expression shifted, and he was about to say something when he glanced at the mirror on the wall out of the corner of his eye. A bloody Arabic number of 1 had surfaced on the mirror when he was not paying attention.\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, the police are closing in on him. Justice always prevails.\u201dInspector Lee continued to talk on the phone, but Chen Ge\u2019s mind was already elsewhere. He placed the phone down and looked at the mirror dumbly.When did this appear? The mirror monster has already left, so why would the number still appear on the mirror\u203dChen Ge was reminded of what he had seen in the bathroom the day before, where half of the mirror monster\u2019s body was outside the mirror and Zhang Peng had voluntarily walked forward to merge himself with the creature.What does this number really mean? Yesterday it was 2, and today it is 1. Does this mean it\u2019ll become zero tomorrow?The dropping number caused Chen Ge\u2019s eyes to dim with concern.\u00a0After Zhang Peng was possessed by the mirror monster, the number started to drop. When Inspector Lee mentioned the coma of the officer, the number dropped again. Does the number represent the number of victims? The mirror monster needs three living victims?Regardless of the real meaning of the number, Chen Ge could not wait anymore because it was now related to innocent lives. A great sense of urgency appeared in his heart.The mirror monster is growing stronger and stronger; tomorrow night might be my last chance already.Chen Ge picked up a dirty cloth to wipe the number on the mirror away; he could not play it safe anymore. After a few more words with Inspector Lee, he ended the call and then entered the Props Room with the black phone.It is now a new day; the Daily Missions will have refreshed already. Now, the only thing that might help me are the Red Specter\u2019s Bloody Heart Mission or the new Nightmare Mission.Chen Ge tapped into the Daily Mission interface of the app.Easy Mission: A normal Haunted House experience should not create permanent trauma to its visitors; I hope you understand this simple theory. Please improve the Haunted House\u2019s security by inspecting the security threats hidden around the Haunted House.Normal Mission: You\u2019ve achieved the criteria to enable the first expansion of the Haunted House, do search for a suitable location soon! Due to space limitations, you are unable to perform any Trial Mission to unlock scenarios!Nightmare Mission: There has always been a second occupant inside your room, wouldn\u2019t you like to meet said person?(Beware! The more difficult the mission, the more dangerous it\u2019ll be, so please choose carefully!)After reading all three missions, Chen Ge\u2019s eyes fell on the Nightmare Mission.The other person inside my room? Just the description of it makes me uncomfortable.Chen Ge knew the possible danger of the Nightmare Mission perfectly well. After a long hesitation, he chose to open the Red Specter\u2019s page instead.\u201cAre you sure you want to accept Zhang Ya\u2019s Bloody Heart Mission? Warning! This mission contains a certain level of danger!\u201dThe app kindly provided Chen Ge with a warning. He rubbed his temples, unable to come to a decision.Both of these missions have a certain degree of risk and danger. However, the rewards of the Nightmare Mission are random; there\u2019s a high chance it might just give me another supportive skill. In comparison, the Bloody Heart Mission\u2026 Zhang Ya has been given the special title of Red Specter and even her own personal page on the app, this means that she is probably a powerful specter, at least several levels higher than the mirror monster. With her help, I should be able to survive this crisis.After thorough analysis, with a grit of his teeth, Chen Ge clicked on Zhang Ya\u2019s Bloody Heart Mission.\u201cAre you sure you want to accept Zhang Ya\u2019s Bloody Heart Mission?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe red interface started to change and peel off like wilting roses, and soon, a new message appeared on screen.\u201cAnderson\u2019s Fairy Tales Volume One, Book Three\u2014Red Dancing Shoes: Once upon a time, there was a pair of ruby red dancing shoes that could make the dancer who wore them light on her feet and perfect at her dance. However, none of the dancers dared put them on because they were a pair of magical shoes, one that would make its dancer keep on dancing until they perished from exhaustion.\u201cPlease arrive at Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy within one hour from accepting the mission and locate Zhang Ya\u2019s red dancing shoes before dawn.\u201cWarning: Don\u2019t be late on your first date, or she\u2019ll be very unhappy.\u201dChen Ge did not know what to feel after reading the mission details. The Private Academy had been abandoned several years earlier due to unknown reasons. However, Chen Ge had heard plenty of scary rumors about it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMy first date with a girl is at an abandoned school after midnight, am I that unlucky at love?The mission required him to be at the Private Academy within one hour. Chen Ge calculated the distance in his mind, and realized he still have some time left.The Private Academy is at this part of town, so not that far away from me. The biggest issue is going there after midnight. Sigh, I\u2019d better go take a bath first; no matter what, this is my first time.After a quick shower, Chen Ge changed into a clean outfit. He stood before the mirror to inspect his image.There are fifty minutes left, why am I feeling so nervous all of a sudden?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Lonelytree\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Millman97After taking a few deep breaths and splashing cold water on his face, Chen Ge finally calmed down.\u201cIt\u2019s time to go.\u201dChen Ge retrieved the backpack that he had used last time and placed Zhang Ya\u2019s love letter, a power bank, and tool mallet into it. After the lesson from last time, he put the penknife directly in his pocket and the doll left behind by his parents inside his shirt pocket. He was bulging all over the place, but at least he felt safer.After packing everything he needed, Chen Ge locked the Haunted House and rushed out of New Century Park. It was 12:15 am, so there was little traffic on the road. He waited for another ten minutes before he managed to hail a cab.\u201cSir, please get me to Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy. I\u2019m in a hurry, so please drive faster.\u201d\u201cNo problem, get in.\u201dThe driver was an easy-going middle-aged uncle, and the radio in the car was playing hit songs from the 90s. Chen Ge sat in the backseat and used this downtime to search for online information related to his current mission.The first thing mentioned by the phone when he accepted the Bloody Heart Mission was Anderson\u2019s Red Dancing Shoes, so that was the first thing Chen Ge looked for on the internet. He managed to find the original source, and after skimming through it, Chen Ge felt rather petrified.The original plot was not much different from the black phone\u2019s version. It described the story of a young girl who was gifted a pair of beautiful red dancing shoes. She loved them so much that she wore them everywhere, including to church, where she was cursed to dance forever. She was afraid, helpless, and exhausted. In the end, she begged the woodman to chop her legs off, and then came the most curious part of the fairy tale. After the legs were chopped off, they danced away into the forest still wearing the red dancing shoes.Is this even a fairy tale?It added to his nervousness since his mission was searching for Zhang Ya\u2019s red dancing shoes.When I won the cursed love letter, the black phone did provide a brief description of Zhang Ya. She was wearing a bloodied school uniform and red dancing shoes at the time of her death, so could the fairy tale be real? The red dancing shoes couldn\u2019t be taken off after they were put on?Chen Ge\u2019s skin crawled. Different from his previous missions, this time he was going face to face with a Red Specter, one that had a Bloody Heart Mission, something that could only be given by specters with heavy resentment.Looks like the key to tonight\u2019s mission is the red dancing shoes.Chen Ge read the fairy tale again for a few times; the main lesson to be learned here was to not be vain but be humble at all time.Was there even a reason for the black phone to refer to this fairy tale at the start of the mission?He could not figure out an answer, so he decided to focus his energy on searches related to Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy. The school was closed after just two years of operation and had been abandoned since then. With regards to the reason for its closure, there were plenty of rumors online. Some said it had to do with lack of budget, whereas others complained about the high semester fees.Chen Ge scrolled through all the information patiently, and Zhang Ya\u2019s name did not even appear once, like she had nothing to do with the school at all.There has to be something more sinister about the closure than what\u2019s been speculated online!Chen Ge looked at the streetlights out the window that seemed to be running backwards, and he squinted his eyes in thought.\u00a0Just what kind of ending could a girl experience to turn her into a Red Specter? Why would she harbor such deep resentment? What does all of that have to do with red dancing shoes?While Chen Ge was deep in his thought, the volume of the radio picked up. He turned toward the source with shock and realized the driver uncle had been looking at him via the rear-view mirror.\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, young man? You have such a sad face.\u201d The driver was a quintessential chatterbox. He had attempted to start a conversation with Chen Ge when Chen Ge entered the car, but Chen Ge had ignored the man mostly because he was busy looking up information.\u201cSo much has changed in my life recently that I\u2019m struggling to get my head around it, feeling rather swamped at the moment.\u201d Chen Ge smiled politely as he put his phone away.\u201cSlow and steady wins the race. I\u2019m sure everything will work out in the end. If you\u2019re that stressed, do what I do: play some disco music, and after a few shakes, you\u2019ll feel much better.\u201d The driver grooved along to the music.At least the man is optimistic,\u00a0thought Chen Ge.\u201cBy the way, why are you going to the Private Academy so late at night? That place is mostly abandoned, and it\u2019s not close to any residential area.\u201dChen Ge\u2019s lips fell open and eventually he answered, \u201cGoing on a date.\u201d\u201cA date? At this kind of ungodly hour?\u201d The driver glanced back at Chen Ge.\u201cIt\u2019s true. I don\u2019t know how to explain it; the girl is a bit hard to please and has some weird quirks.\u201d Chen Ge tried to normalize it as best as he could. After all, he had not been asked out on a date before, and being invited to one did make him feel quite good about himself.\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing! What are you worried about, worried that she won\u2019t like you? Then again, what kind of person goes to a date dressed like you? Listen to me, even guys need to know how to dress these days. Look at that backpack, it goes against the rest of your outfit.\u201dThe floodgate of the driver\u2019s mouth had been opened, and Chen Ge did not even know how to respond. A normal person going on a date would have been happy and overjoyed, but his date was more like a coercion and a desperate move to save himself than an actual date.\u201cA gentleman mustn\u2019t be too forward, don\u2019t start the conversation with random topics like the weather, compliment her, and be a good listener. After all, the first impression is very important\u2026\u201d Listening to the driver\u2019s advice, Chen Ge had half a mind to play Wedding Dress on his phone so that everyone could have a little peace and quiet.The taxi zoomed through the night. The cars on the road and the buildings beside it had gotten increasingly sparse; even the streetlights had started to disappear. The signs of civilization outside the window started to disappear, and the road was slowly swallowed up by the forest.The driver glanced at the GPS and asked Chen Ge, \u201cAre you sure you got the right address? Other than an abandoned school, there\u2019s nothing down the road.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure, just drop me off near the school. How much?\u201d\u201c19, do you mind paying me via WeChat? I just started my shift, and I don\u2019t have spare change on me.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201dAs Chen Ge grabbed his phone out of his pocket, the penknife bounced out of it as well. The knife sat quietly on the cushion, causing the driver who spotted it to lean surreptitiously forward. The driver moved his hand to lower the volume of the radio. As he did so, he stealthily used his pinkie finger to press a button on the machine.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNone of this escaped Chen Ge\u2019s eyes. However, there was nothing he could do but continue to smile. He believed the uncle had mistaken him for some kind of late-night burglar.\u201cTransaction successful.\u201d Chen Ge put away his phone and glanced at the driver seat. \u201cUncle, you\u2019re recording this to report to the police?\u201dThe driver, who was in the middle of drinking from a bottle of water, coughed violently as he waved his hands about vehemently.\u201cI can understand why you\u2019re doing that but\u2026\u201d Chen Ge turned to look at the eerie outline of the school in the dark.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m really here for a date.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He pressed some random button on the machine. After driving for another two or three meters, the red light on the driver\u2019s walkie-talkie lit up. He pressed it lightly, and before he could say anything, a rough, gravelly voice appeared.\u201cLao Liu, you\u2019re also near Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy? What is wrong with people tonight? I also have a passenger with me who wants to go there. Actually, we\u2019re quite close. By the way, what is this message that you sent to the group? \u2018I am meld postage\u2019?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, just focus on your passenger.\u201d The driver swiped the sweat on his forehead away and quickly hung up on the walkie-talkie.\u201cThat should be I am held hostage, right? Uncle, didn\u2019t you say you trust me?\u201d Chen Ge asked with his eyebrow raised. Afraid that the driver uncle might just call the cops on him, he said, \u201cYou can drop me right here.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d The driver was quick to follow his instruction. Chen Ge even managed to see that the man\u2019s legs were shaking.Chen Ge looked around to make sure he did not leave behind anything. After he got out and closed the door, he looked up and saw the running sign on top of the taxi say\u2014\u2019I am being held hostage, please call the police!\u2019\u201cUncle, you sure are creative.\u201dThe taxi left Chen Ge like it had grown wings. Several seconds later, the several hundred meters around Chen Ge fell silent. It was a starless night like it was going to rain soon. The rainclouds were hanging low in the sky, blocking out all light. Chen Ge pulled out his phone to look at the time; there were still eight minutes left until the designated time.Just now, inside the car, the person on the walkie-talkie said he\u2019s also bringing a passenger to the Private Academy. That person is coming here at 1 am, could it have something to do with me?Chen Ge reminded himself to be careful. If not for the time limitation, he probably would have hidden himself in the brush by the side of the road to see who was following him.Only eight minutes left. I\u2019d better go familiarize myself with the layout of the school first. I\u2019ll need all the advantages I can get.The area surrounding Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy was a piece of deserted land. There were no streetlights, only a single road cutting through heavy forest and shrubbery.Flipping on the flashlight on his phone, Chen Ge followed the road for another hundred meters before reaching the abandoned school\u2019s front gate. The chains and the iron bars had already rusted together. The gate was too heavy to even budge. Looking through the bars, all Chen Ge could see was darkness.How do I get in?Chen Ge paced around the gate. He tossed his backpack over the gate first before taking several steps back. With a running start, he grabbed hold of the bricks on the wall as he jumped over the outside wall.The school compound was not big; the whole area could be seen with one glance. There were several tall silhouettes standing in the dark like solitary watchmen. The school\u2019s sign had long since been removed. Chen Ge himself did not know what the real name of the school was. Like everyone else in the city, he only knew it as Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy.The overgrown shrubbery had swallowed up most of the path. It scratched Chen Ge\u2019s legs at every step, making him feel both ticklish and painful.I\u2019ve managed to arrive within the designated time limit; now my mission is to find Zhang Ya\u2019s red dancing shoes.Chen Ge pulled out the mallet from his backpack. Feeling the icy metallic touch on his skin, Chen Ge felt much safer.Using his phone as guidance, Chen Ge walked deeper into the school. He only took several steps before he felt something was wrong. He stopped moving and took several steps back.Is it my imagination? How come it feels like there is something pushing me into the school? And when I tried to walk backwards, there was a mysterious force blocking me from behind.Chen Ge turned to look over his shoulder, but there was nothing there. He used the phone to shower some light behind him, and there was nothing like ghost or spirit as he has imagined.Could it be that she\u2019s already here? Standing behind me? Only I can\u2019t see her?\u00a0Chen Ge shivered. The thought of swinging the mallet at the space behind him cropped up in his mind, but he thought,\u00a0What if Zhang Ya is really behind me and this swing angers her?He was a mere Haunted House owner; he was practically defenseless stranded in this deserted school. He shuddered, thinking about the ending should he manage to anger a baleful specter.In any case, I should go in first.Chen Ge pulled his backpack higher as he walked into the school holding up his phone and the mallet. The night darkened, and a draft picked up; it even carried a light dusting of rain with it.The most probable locations where I will find the red dancing shoes are either the female changing room at the dance studio or Zhang Ya\u2019s former bedroom. I\u2019ll have to focus on these two locations.Chen Ge headed toward the building that was closest to him. The trees inside the school had grown into twisted shapes, and the wild grass had grown up to Chen Ge\u2019s waist. There were statues that littered the school compound, and most of them were human figures. All in all, the place radiated an air of eeriness in the dark.The girl\u2019s dormitory?The dormitory building was not tall, only four-stories high. However, it did look creepy, probably due to an extended period of abandonment. The glass door of the building was locked up tight using a metal chain. Chen Ge leaned against the glass to take a closer look.The doors on both sides of the dark corridor were tightly closed, but curious enough, a solitary chair sat in the middle of the corridor facing away from the bedroom door.A single chair is left right in the middle of the corridor? Is there some special meaning to this?Chen Ge leaned back from the glass door.\u00a0Both the main gate and the hostel entrance have been locked, and the corridor doesn\u2019t seem to have any trash in it. This goes to show that when they were closing the school, they cleaned the place up first, so why did they leave a chair right in the middle of the corridor? Just a mere coincidence?If the chair was purposely left behind by the school management, then what is the meaning of it? If it was not left behind by the school, then who moved the chair to the middle of the corridor after the place was locked up?Chen Ge aimed his phone at the glass door. The chair was placed around five meters away from the entrance, and there was a broken hall light right above it.The light is already broken, and the electrical wiring is even exposed. Chair and wiring, is it me or that looks like a hanging scene?Honestly, after seeing this curious scene, Chen Ge\u2019s heart had started to palpitate.I\u2019m probably just overthinking.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe looked left and right. The breeze caused the leaves to rustle. The school after dark was hauntingly creepy.I can\u2019t scare myself for no reason. After all, Zhang Ya, the Red Specter, is the scariest presence at this school. I have her love letter, so who dares to challenge me?Considering the situation, this was the only way Chen Ge could console himself.Furthermore, this is just an affection mission. To put it simply, it\u2019s a special kind of date. There\u2019s nothing to be worried about.He gave himself a pep talk, and when he was done, he walked back toward the glass door with the mallet. He was about to smash the door when his eyes caught a shocking detail.The chair that should have been right under the hall light had moved one meter away from the light fixture. It seemed to have moved forward.F*ck!\u00a0This was the first time Chen Ge experienced something like this.\u00a0What just happened?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He waited for ten seconds, and the chair remained unmoved.Is it because I\u2019m watching it?Chen Ge walked forward and turned on his phone\u2019s recording function before cradling it within the chains on the door. Then, he walked back to the abandoned garden outside the building and waited patiently.The school at midnight was unsettlingly quiet; there was not even the sound of a bird or insect chirping. About three minutes later, Chen Ge returned to the dormitory; he had prepared himself for the worst. However, when he stood at the glass door, he saw that the chair was still where it was, just one meter away from the broken hall light.Didn\u2019t move? What\u2019s going on?Chen Ge walked to the door and picked up the phone from the chain. He looked through the video and saw nothing out of the ordinary. The chair sat in the middle of the corridor just as it should.It\u2019ll only move when it\u2019s around a living human?When the thought appeared in his mind, Chen Ge instantly felt something was wrong. He turned to look down the corridor, and the chair had moved two meters ahead again; it was now incredibly close to the glass door!It moved forward again? What does that mean? It only moves when I am close, does this mean it wants something from me?It would have been a lie to say he was not afraid, but Chen Ge\u2019s tolerance for fear was much higher than most, so he managed to maintain a clear mind under such situation.The school is clearly haunted, but before I understand why, I should try my best to avoid these things.Chen Ge actually wanted to smash the glass door and rushed in to bash the chair into pieces. However, considering the blind spots inside the building, he was afraid there were threats hidden in corners that he could not see. He was afraid that after entering the building, it was not the chair that would snap but himself.Tonight\u2019s main mission is to locate that pair of red dancing shoes. As long as this weird stuff doesn\u2019t interrupt with my progress, there\u2019s no reason for me to interact with it.\u00a0Chen Ge grabbed his phone and retreated from the door.\u00a0I\u2019d better go investigate other places first. I can always return if I can\u2019t find the dancing shoes. After all, the mission is considered successful as long as I locate them before sunrise; there is still plenty of time.Chen Ge committed the location of the girl\u2019s dormitory to memory before retracing his step back to the school gate. He switched his phone off and squatted near the main gate, holding the mallet in his hand.Based on the time, the taxi behind me should have arrived already, so why is the road still so dark?A car\u2019s headlights would be extremely eye-catching against the total darkness, but Chen Ge waited for a long time without seeing any source of light heading toward the school.Could there have been an accident?This detail had not left his mind. Chen Ge knew there was no such thing as coincidence in this world; the person who followed him to Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy had some motive of their own.The opponent probably knew that I would wait for them, so they came out from the car earlier and walked the rest of the way on foot? If that\u2019s the case, then this is troublesome.Chen Ge wished that he was wrong. He already had more than enough on his plate as it was.In any case, I\u2019ll need to pick up pace. I have two advantages on my side: I\u2019ve familiarized myself with the surrounding since I got here first, and I have Zhang Ya on my side. She won\u2019t watch me get bullied on her home turf, right?Perhaps Chen Ge\u2019s eyes had gotten used to the darkness, or maybe it was the effect of the Ying-Yang Vision, but things were no longer that blurry in the dark.Those in the light open themselves to being hunted by those in the dark.Chen Ge did not turn on his phone but headed toward another building in the dark. The tallest building in the school was the education building. It was five-stories tall, and behind it was a field that was unkempt and overgrown. On the other end of the field was a building that sat itself apart from other buildings.The building stood out because it had faded red paint.The education building is for classes, so the dancing shoes won\u2019t be there; the possibility is even lower for the boy\u2019s dormitory. I\u2019d better go take a look at the red building then.Chen Ge walked along the outer perimeter of the field before he reached the front door of the curious building.The building was as tall as the girl\u2019s dormitory, but it was only two thirds the size. Once he got close, Chen Ge noticed how truly unusual this building was. There was a wooden sign that was placed before the front door, and two conspicuous words were painted on it with red ink\u2014NO ENTRY!What is the purpose of this building?Curiosity is part of human nature. Chen Ge\u2019s desire to enter the building only rose after reading the warning sign.\u00a0Something must have happened here several years ago\u2014maybe the red dancing shoes I\u2019m looking for are inside.Chen Ge walked around the wooden sign and saw the front door was sealed up with two locks.I could break the door down with the mallet, but it\u2019ll create too much commotion; that might attract the attention of the person who is following me.Chen Ge thus shied away from the door and walked around the edge of the building. There, he saw a window that was seriously worn\u2014even a large piece of the glass was missing.This can be my point of entry.\u00a0Chen Ge extended his hand through the window to open the lock from within. To play it safe, he waited for several minutes to ensure that no one was inside before he jumped in.He closed the window and moved everything to how it was before. Chen Ge did not dare lower his guard as he surveyed his surroundings. He had landed himself in an artist studio. The walls were pasted with the students\u2019 handiwork, and marble models sat on the shelves.This place does look creepy, but it is no competition for my Haunted House.Chen Ge walked through the rows of marble models as he headed for the room\u2019s back door. He looked through the door\u2019s window and saw a banner with the words \u2018Arts Activities Center\u2019 hanging on the corridor.Looks like I\u2019m at the right place.\u00a0Chen Ge pulled the door open slowly. Perhaps because it had not been used for a long time, the sound of the door sliding on its hinges was grating on Chen Ge\u2019s ears.Calm down, just leave immediately after you find the shoes.Since he was inside an enclosed building, Chen Ge switched on his phone again. The dim light did not bring him any comfort. If anything, it only heightened the fear in Chen Ge\u2019s heart.Chen Ge looked through the first-floor rooms one by one. All of them were artist studios. In fact, some of them still had easels and paintings that had been left behind.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis building has four stories; the dance studio I\u2019m looking for is probably on another floor.Armed with his phone and the mallet, Chen Ge headed up the stairs. When he reached the second floor, his heart started to race, and his back was covered with chills.Because as he turned to look down the corridor of the second floor, there sat a wooden chair.This thing again?The muscles in Chen Ge\u2019s hand grew taut, as he gripped the mallet even tighter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The memory of what he had seen at the girl\u2019s dormitory was still fresh in Chen Ge\u2019s mind. These chairs seemed to have the tendency to get close to living humans.Hiding at the staircase, he started to hesitate.It has a back for people to lean on, and it looks different from all the other chairs I\u2019ve seen in this building. It seems to have been moved here from someplace else, but why would someone do that?Upon closer inspection, the chair looked similar to the one Chen Ge had seen inside the girl\u2019s dormitory; it was likely one of the chairs the school management assigned to the dormitory rooms.Chen Ge used the camera on his phone to zoom in on the sign on one of the doors; it said something related to vocal training.\u00a0The dance studio is not on the second floor, it seems\u2014 should I just head to the third floor? But what if there\u2019s another wooden chair on the third floor\u2019s corridor? If it starts to chase after me, won\u2019t I be blocked from both sides?As the creepy image flashed across his mind, Chen Ge decided to enter the second-floor corridor. The corridor was so shadowy that Chen Ge could not see the end. The doors on both sides were closed, and the windows were crusted with a thick layer of dust, blocking Chen Ge of the view inside.Chen Ge took deliberate steps. He did not think to hurry simply because of the possible threat from the wooden chair. In fact, for Chen Ge, the abandoned classrooms on both sides seemed scarier than the chair.I wonder how long it has been since a living soul stepped into this place. The dust on the floor is so thick, and I have no way of dealing with the footprints that I\u2019ve left. If the person following me has also entered this building, I\u2019ll definitely be discovered.Even in this situation, Chen Ge did not forget about the hidden threat of the third party.\u00a0I have get this over with as soon as possible!The light on Chen Ge\u2019s phone wavered as his arms moved. He inched closer to the wooden chair.In reality, there\u2019s nothing really scary about this, right? What can a wooden chair really do?Chen Ge walked around the chair, and it gave him the feeling that it was just a wooden chair and nothing more.Maybe I should take a closer look at it\u2026As the thought cropped up in Chen Ge\u2019s mind, he had already put it into motion. He knocked the chair to its side, and it was then that he noticed the handwriting underneath the chair.Qian Yujiao? That sounds like the name of a girl.In any case, the appearance of the name confirmed Chen Ge\u2019s earlier suspicion. The chair wasn\u2019t native to the Activities Centre but belonged to a specific individual. When the school hosted large events, the management would have the students bring their own chairs. To prevent confusion, many would jot down their name underneath their chair.Does this mean there\u2019s also a name underneath the chair in the girl\u2019s dormitory?Chen Ge memorized the name. After some hesitation, he decided not to break the chair but placed it inside one of the empty classrooms.\u00a0The longer I stay here, the more uncomfortable I feel. I\u2019d better head up to the third floor soon.He returned via the route that he had come from and climbed up the stairs to the third floor. The corridor was empty this time. Chen Ge pushed open the door for some of the classrooms. The tables and chairs were all pushed to the back of the room, and parts of the wall had been repainted\u2014it was rather obvious because the wall had two different hues.The school was already closing, so why did they waste money to repaint the wall? For whom is this for?Chen Ge\u2019s experience at Ping An Apartments provided him with a possibility.It\u2019s probably to hide something.He used the mallet to peel at the paint, but weirdly enough, the wall behind the new paint was completely normal; there were no blood stains or weird marks.No, there has to be something more than this.Chen Ge continued his tour of the classrooms. He realized that not all the classrooms had been coated with new paint. There were spots that had been repainted, and some of them were curiously close to the indoor piping.This building\u2019s water drainage system was probably updated before its closure.\u00a0Chen Ge looked up at the piping and concluded,\u00a0The classrooms on the first and second floor showed obvious signs of usage, but the classrooms on the third floor seem to have been abandoned even before the closure.The tables and chairs were piled on top of each other, and there was not one piece of chalk left on the lectern. Some of the classrooms even had locks on them.Ghost haunting? Murder? Hidden security concern?There could be many different reasons for the sealing of the place, and Chen Ge could not pinpoint which one it was. He exited the classroom and headed up the fourth floor.When he took the first step, Chen Ge turned back to see whether the wooden chair was following him or not.It wasn\u2019t.When he reached the landing between the third and fourth floor, there was a rope tied across the two banisters of the stair that blocked his way. There was a wooden board hanging on it. Similar to the one at the front door, it said \u2018NO ENTRY\u2019.Naturally, Chen Ge was not deterred by the wooden sign. He picked it up and put it to the side before bending down to scurry under the rope.As he reached the fourth floor, Chen Ge noticed with his first glance that a faded room sign was hanging on the door of the room right opposite from him.The dance studio!After such a long search at the Activities Center, he had finally located the venue where the red dancing shoes had the highest chance of appearing. The layout of the fourth floor was different from the other floors in the sense that instead of individual classroom, the walls had been knocked out to form a large studio.After tearing down the seals and prying open the lock, Chen Ge pushed open the door to the dance studio that had been left unused for many years. The place appeared to have been forgotten by time; things seemed to be how they were several years ago.The slick floor was filled with a thin coat of dust, and the room was suffused with a weird smell. The closest description Chen Ge had for the smell was heavy deodorant that had gone off after being trapped in an enclosed room for years.Chen Ge walked into the studio, sticking close to the wall. The studio was at a professional level; the wooden floor was waxed to accommodate the dance practice, and the walls were equipped with acoustic boards and panels to prevent the noise from disturbing the other classrooms.This is the first time I\u2019ve seen such a large dance studio.Chen Ge used his camera to zoom in on the various angles of the room. The walls were mounted with bars that one usually saw in ballet classes. The bars\u2019 height was adjustable, and underneath them were a row of low seats that students could use for rest.On the other end of the room were six floor-length mirrors that were perfectly joined together. Each mirror was about one meter wide and two meters tall.I\u2019d almost forgotten that mirrors are a necessary fixture inside a dance studio.Looking at the row of mirrors, Chen Ge sucked in a cold breath. He then noticed, situated right at the middle of the mirrors, three wooden chairs.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThree at once?Chen Ge bit on his lips before walking over to the chairs, his every action reflected in the mirror.Facing his own reflection in the mirror amid an empty dance studio at midnight, Chen Ge felt increasingly unsettled.Resisting the urge to break the mirrors, he toppled the three chairs to their sides, and like the chair he had found earlier, all of them had a girl\u2019s name written underneath them.Including the chair at the girl\u2019s dormitory, I\u2019ve stumbled across five chairs already. If every single one of them represents a girl, then this means I\u2019m dealing with the spirits of five girls. So, the question is, what has really happened to them?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He returned the three chairs to how they had been before turning his head to look around the room. Due to the wall of mirrors, the dance studio felt larger and emptier than it was.The place is so clean. It has been probably cleaned more than once recently.There was no visible trash on the floor, and this was not good news for Chen Ge.Someone has messed with the place already. Hopefully, the red dancing shoes haven\u2019t been tossed out.Chen Ge moved away from the wall of mirrors to the corner of the dance studio. The wall was covered with various certificates and accolade. There was also something that looked like a results list. After taking a closer look, Chen Ge found an anomaly. The first place of the list had been crossed off with a marker pen.A list without the winner?Chen Ge found all of the girls\u2019 names, including Qian Yujiao, on the list, but he could not find Zhang Ya.He moved his gaze away, and one of the pictures on the wall grabbed his attention. It was a group photo of six individuals. Five of them were smiling brightly at the camera in a group hug while the sixth stood alone in the corner, quite a distance away from the rest. The photo had been manipulated to cut her out, if not for the snow-white dance shoes that peeked out from the corner, Chen Ge would have thought this was a group photo of five girls.These are all individual photos or group photos, why isn\u2019t there a photo of the whole class?Chen Ge aimed his phone at the wall and snapped a photo. Then, moving forward along the wall, he soon stopped before a room without a sign. Compelled by curiosity, he pushed the door open and walked into it.The small room was equipped with a desk, a dresser, and a single bed.This appears to be the office of the teacher, but why is there a bed? The teacher needed to work the night shift?Chen Ge ransacked the room in the hope of locating the red dancing shoes. Unfortunately, the dresser was empty, and the drawers of the desk were filled with nothing but photocopies of winning certificates.Looks like the dance students here were all very talented, since they won so many prizes.\u00a0Chen Ge picked up a few random pieces to look at, and one of them had the name of Qian Yujiao\u2019s group printed on it.\u00a0Swan Lake Citywide Ballet Group Competition Champion. This means that they were qualified to join the state-wide competition.This certificate was not pasted on the wall outside, and most curiously, the winning group was supposed to have six names, but the last name had once again been crossed off.It\u2019s the same as the result list.Chen Ge wandered around the room for a little while longer before leaving it empty-handed. Chen Ge\u2019s heart skipped a beat when he pulled the door open. The three chairs had moved from their original position to a spot closer to the door that he had just exited.It has started again!Chen Ge told himself to just ignore those chairs. He rushed to look for other clues. If he could not come up with any clues for the next three minutes, he had decided to leave the Activities Center. Using his phone as a light source, Chen Ge walked to the deepest edge of the dance studio before he found the door that said the girl\u2019s dressing room.According to rumors, the girl\u2019s bathroom and dressing room are where the Ying energy is the most concentrated at any school. I\u2019ll need to be extra careful.He pushed the door slowly open. The dressing room was lined on both sides by steel lockers, and a long wooden chair sat in the middle.So, this is what a girl\u2019s dressing room looks like.This was the first time Chen Ge had entered such a place. He left the door half closed and walked into the room to pull open one of the lockers. A girl\u2019s school uniform was placed on the top level of the iron shelf. The design was different from other public school; it was more exquisite and prettier.The skirt barely reaches my knees, isn\u2019t that a bit too short?Chen Ge searched through the uniform\u2019s pockets and found nothing. He looked down the shelf and spotted a pair of white dancing shoes.The color is not right, not the ones I\u2019m looking for.After closing the locker room, Chen Ge realized there was a small card pasted above the lock; it had the girl\u2019s name written on it.\u00a0Now, this should make my life easier.Using his phone, he examined the names on the lockers, but after one round, he still had not found Zhang Ya\u2019s name. However, he did find a solitary locker at the corner, isolated from the rest without a marking or a name.The owner of this locker seems to have been ostracized by the rest.\u00a0Chen Ge opened the door, and other than a dirtied ballet dress that sat on the top level of the shelf, there was nothing else.No name and ostracized, who could this locker belong to?\u00a0Chen Ge already had the answer inside his heart. He took out the dress and realized there were five candy boxes that had gone sour hidden underneath the dress.What are these for? Presents?\u00a0Chen Ge placed the ballet dress on the wooden chair and picked up the candy boxes. Every box had been hand-wrapped, and each one of them had a girl\u2019s name written on top. Every name was different, but the handwriting was similar, so they probably came from the same person.These candy boxes were most likely the presents that she prepared.When Chen Ge picked up the last box, he noticed a picture that was placed at the bottom. The picture was the complete version of the picture that was stuck on the wall outside. On the back of it was written, \u201cCongratulations to Room 414 for winning the qualifications to enter the state-wide competition.\u201d The front showed six girls.Five of them were happily celebrating on the right side on the picture while the sixth girl was standing about half a palm away from the rest. The girl had a tall figure, about 1.7 meters, and she looked like the main character of Swan Lake, graceful, pure, gentle, and beautiful. Even in the same picture, her supernatural grace put her apart from the rest.\u201cCould this be Zhang Ya?\u201d muttered Chen Ge. He really could not reconcile the girl in the picture with the cruel and vicious Red Specter.It was a pure accident that Chen Ge mentioned Zhang Ya\u2019s name, but when he did so, the lockers in the girl\u2019s dressing room started to creak and rattle\u2014it sounded like they were overloaded and were about to burst. On top of that, Chen Ge could hear an insistent banging noise coming from outside the door, like someone was trying to get in.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWho is it?\u201dAfter shoving the picture inside his pocket, Chen Ge turned towards the half-closed door as his grip on the mallet tightened. He looked through the opening and saw that the three wooden chairs had formed a barricade at the entrance.\u201cYou really think I don\u2019t have the guts to smash you all into pieces?\u201d Chen Ge\u2019s back was drenched in cold sweat, but he did keep his word as he walked toward the chairs with the mallet in hand. There was no other exit from the girl\u2019s dressing room; if he didn\u2019t clear a way out for himself, things would only get worse for him.Chen Ge\u2019s eyes wandered outwards as he tried to plan his escape route. However, his legs froze when his eyes landed on the wall of mirrors in the dance studio.The mirrors were reflecting the situation in the dance studio. The only difference was\u2026 there were three girls sitting on the three chairs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Lonelytree\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Millman97Teetering bodies, dirtied school uniforms, pale faces, and moving mouths like they were trying to say something. The three girls\u2019 faces were frozen in fear and terror, and their bodies seemed to have grown out of the wooden chairs.As his gaze alternated between the mirrors and the entrance of the girl\u2019s dressing room, a chill crept over Chen Ge\u2019s heart. Just not too long ago, he had tipped the chair over and observed them closely.Could that be considered my first intimate contact with a female?He shivered involuntarily, and his footsteps that headed toward the door hastened. As he wandered closer to the exit, the three chairs shuffled incrementally forward, and the lockers in the dressing room rattled slightly.After he mentioned Zhang Ya\u2019s name, things seemed to have changed inside the dance studio. The name appeared to be a taboo here.The mirrors can only reflect what is in the dance studio. Perhaps there\u2019s something even worse in the dressing room\u2014I need to leave, pronto!As if confirming his thought, the steel doors of the lockers started to creak like something was trying to escape from them. Holding the mallet in his hand, Chen Ge raced toward the door. With a running start, Chen Ge used his legs to kick the chairs that blocked his way. As he tried to rush out, he felt something pull on his shoulders.He turned to look at the mirror, and in the reflection, two slender and pale arms could be seen hanging off his shoulders. Without a second thought, Chen Ge turned and started his assault!Bang!The mallet landed on the back of the chair, causing a crack to appear on the chair. The scream of a woman reverberated in his ears. In the mirror, he could see the female student on the chair glare fiendishly at his back while her arms encircled themselves tightly around his shoulders like she was trying to press him onto the seat of the chair.What is the purpose of her doing this? Could this be some kind of evil musical chairs game where my soul will be eternally trapped inside the chair if I sit on it?The force on his shoulders gradually increased as pairs of pale arms latched themselves onto him, trying to pull him back into the girl\u2019s dressing room. To make matters worse, Chen Ge could hear shuffling from the outside corridor, and several seconds later, another wooden chair appeared at the entrance of the dance studio.My luck is always used at the worst possible moment. It chooses a time like this to make me popular with the girls!Chen Ge was at his limit. Instead of running away, he shifted to attack mode. With one hand on the chair\u2019s back, he used his other hand to swing the mallet around, laying waste to the chairs that surrounded him!When his mallet formed the first crack on the chair, Chen Ge had noticed that the expression of the female student shifted from pleading to venomous resentment. Through the shift in expression, Chen Ge came up with the conclusion that the chairs should be their items of possession, similar to how Xiaoxiao\u2019s family attached themselves to the ragdolls.Demolishing the items of attachment won\u2019t destroy them, but at least it\u2019ll be able to injure them.The force on him intensified. A newbie who had not experienced this before would probably have ended up as a willing lamb for this group of girls by now. Unfortunately, their opponent was Chen Ge. This proprietor of a Haunted House had just spent a night at a haunted apartment with a serial killer. Chen Ge still knew fear, but after multiple incidents, his resistance to fear had been trained. Even when he was in fear or shock, he could still manage to make the correct decision, and his grip on the mallet didn\u2019t waver.Bang!Chen Ge smashed the chair and gripped the ends of the chair to swing at another chair. The image reflected in the mirror was a bit hard to describe in words, but Chen Ge did not have time to deal with that anymore.He used about ten seconds to destroy one of the chairs. Just as he turned to aim his wrath at the second chair, he felt something grip his neck. Turning his head to the mirror, he saw a pale hand choking his throat. His opponent seemed to have given up the thought of pressing him onto the chair and decided to kill him instead.This shift in situation did not slow Chen Ge down; instead, it only made him more vicious as he gripped the chairs and smashed them at the wall. As the chairs cracked, the force around his neck lightened. When all three chairs were nothing but splinters, the chokehold around his neck finally disappeared.\u201cLeaving these things behind benefits no one. Later, I\u2019ll burn all of you to help you seek closure.\u201d Chen Ge leaned against the mirror and tried to catch his breath. There were visible strangle marks around his neck.The fighting must have created tons of commotion. This will definitely attract the attention of the person who is following me. I\u2019ll need to leave as soon as possible. Anyway, the red dancing shoes don\u2019t seem to be here.This place was definitely haunted, so Chen Ge didn\u2019t want to stay at the dance studio anymore. The sound of the rattling of the lockers inside the girl\u2019s dressing room intensified, and that was not something that could be caused by a draft. Other than that, there were many other curious happenings like the sudden deepening in the colors of the walls and floor as well as the weird \u2018ping, ping\u2019 noises from the corridor that had gotten far more frequent.Just as Chen Ge prepared to leave, he almost tripped from someone pulling on his lower calf.Chen Ge turned to look at the mirror and saw the three female students were pulling on his leg, their fingernails almost pushing into Chen Ge\u2019s skin.Seeing this, Chen Ge also grew desperate. He smacked his mallet down on the wooden splinters, but no matter how hard he smashed, the girls did not release their grips on his calf.The weird noise in the corridor was getting closer, and the vengeful faces that were pulling on Chen Ge started to laugh maniacally. A heavy cloth seemed to fall over the dance studio because the light from his phone started to twist as the heavy stench that Chen Ge had caught a hint of earlier started to suffuse the air.There\u2019s a scarier presence hiding at this school?Chen Ge was spooked by the thought in his mind. He dared to come to this school so late at night mainly because he assumed Zhang Ya was the scariest presence this school had to offer. He was there to do a favor for Zhang Ya, so she had no reason to harm him.This is bad.Something seemed to have reached the door of the dance studio, and the stink in the air intensified.The three girls on the floor were glaring at Chen Ge with fierce and sinister expressions. Chen Ge\u2019s back was leaning against the mirror. He reached into his pocket, and his fingertip had just touched the doll when the weird noise at the door retreated with a speed that was faster than it was when it arrived. Then, the stink in the air slowly vanished.What happened? It feels like the thing outside the door was scared.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAll the weird noises disappeared instantly, and Chen Ge could only hear his heartbeat then. The light twisted at a greater degree than before, and the temperature in the room seemed to have dropped further.What is happening?The pulling on his calf had also disappeared. Chen Ge lowered his head and saw the three female students were hiding as far away as they could and looking at the space behind him with desperation in their eyes.Behind me?Chen Ge turned his head awkwardly around to face the tall mirror. The image reflected back at him was not his own but a woman in a blood-red school uniform looking down at him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The elegant school uniform was dripping with fresh blood that caused it to stick to her body. Her face was hidden behind her hair, and the overly pale skin that was exposed looked scary.The cold light from the phone screen twisted, and Chen Ge could feel his limbs becoming frozen. He used every ounce of energy in his body to stabilize his lips before he could utter the girl\u2019s name.\u201cZhang Ya?\u201dAs if hearing Chen Ge\u2019s voice, the girl slowly raised her head. The curtain of black hair parted to the side, and an unblemished face appeared in his view. However, the mirror started to mist when her head was only raised halfway. She took a step forward, and she disappeared from the mirror.\u201cWhere did she go?\u201dChen Ge stared at the mirror, and something even more curious happened. Cast from the phone\u2019s light, his shadow slowly stood up to stand behind him.Chen Ge could see that the shadow was about 1.7 meters tall. As the dripping sound of something like blood entered his ears, the shadow started to gain color. The bloodied uniform stuck to its body, and it was all red.Chen Ge stood where he was and did not dare move. The chilliness from his back had climbed up his spine to his brain. Right then, the red shadow took another step back to lean against his back!Standing back to back, Chen Ge\u2019s body froze. Even as he gasped for air, the sensation that he was running out of air would not go away.The specter has stuck to my back?Standing back to back was sometimes quite scary because you could not know who was standing behind you.Something cold seemed to reach for his fingers. Chen Ge did not dare turn to take a look. His frozen fingers slowly opened to allow the phone to slide to the floor. The light flickered twice before it switched off suddenly.Surrounded by darkness, the coldness behind his back continued to spread. Chen Ge couldn\u2019t even imagine the things that were happening to him.\u00a02 am, inside an abandoned school\u2019s dance studio, facing a tall mirror, standing back to back with a Red Specter\u2026 in a way, I guess one could call this romance.Various thoughts crossed Chen Ge\u2019s mind. Something was holding his hand, and it made him feel increasingly cold. The hair of the girl behind him was moving as it entwined itself with Chen Ge\u2019s hair.What is she planning to do? My mission here is to find the red dancing shoes. I\u2019ll fail the mission if I am unable to do that before dawn.However, Chen Ge\u2019s body was frozen in place, and the only thing he could do was stare at the mirror before him. He did not notice it initially, but several seconds later, he realized with a start that fuzzy shadows were forming inside the mirror. He widened his eyes as the shadows started to become clearer.Wait, aren\u2019t these the girls who are trapped inside the chairs?Inside the mirror, five girls in clean uniforms entered the dance studio. Their outfits were completely different from what Chen Ge had seen earlier, so he suspected that the images he saw now were reflecting scenes that happened years ago.The five girls walked toward the mirror, laughing among themselves. Soon after they entered the studio, Zhang Ya showed up. Even though they were wearing the same uniform, Zhang Ya carried herself in a different way than the rest of the girls.She was carrying a bag in her hands. Chen Ge had seen this bag before inside the girl\u2019s dressing room; it was holding the five candy boxes.Zhang Ya seemed to be in quite a good mood. She walked into the dressing room with hurried steps, and several minutes later, all six girls came out wearing their ballet dresses.The situation had not changed much. The five girls were in their little group while Zhang Ya tailed behind alone.Not long after they started their training, the dance studio\u2019s door was pushed open. A female teacher walked in holding the Swan Lake winning certificate in her hand. She was talking animatedly with the girls, probably encouraging and congratulating them.That day was probably not a normal school day because Chen Ge didn\u2019t see any other students. The six of them were likely there to do intensive training to prepare for the state-wide competition.The female teacher left after half an hour. After making sure the teacher had left, the five girls stopped practicing and started playing on their phones and chatting while lying on the floor. The only one practicing was Zhang Ya.Then, one of the girls said something while pointing at Zhang Ya. The rest of the girls laughed with the exception of Zhang Ya. However, she did not seem to mind it too much. After practicing for a little while longer, she stopped to rest. Then she turned to walk into the dressing room and came out with the bag of candy boxes.Zhang Ya passed them to the girls, but as one of them reached for it, she was stopped by one of the other girls, who was as tall as Zhang Ya. She said many things while pointing her finger assertively at Zhang Ya. She then ran into the dressing room and came out with a school bag. She pulled out several love letters from it. From the name, Chen Ge knew they were all addressed to Zhang Ya.This could not really be considered an argument because it was totally one-sided, dominated by the other girl who was weirdly agitated.Zhang Ya\u2019s candy boxes were thus rejected. She placed them back into the bag and left. Chen Ge thought that was the end, but not long after that, the door to the dance studio was pushed open again. The few girls were startled. Thinking it was the teacher, they quickly climbed up from the floor and started to \u2018practice\u2019.A fuzzy shadow of a male walked in. He was about 1.8 meters tall, slouching, and very large in size.The man said something to the girls, and only two said something in return to him. Chen Ge was confused by his identity.The girls soon returned to their practice, and the man entered the office. Later, he opened the office door and waved for Zhang Ya to come to him. Zhang Ya appeared like she did not know or even trust the man. She walked toward the office with hesitation and stood at the door but did not go in.The mirror could not reflect what was inside the office. However, about eight seconds later, the scene on the mirror darkened as Zhang Ya ran out of the office. Holding his arm, the man chased after her while cursing all the way.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAll five girls in the dance studio saw this, but all of them sat where they were. None of them were willing to go to Zhang Ya\u2019s aid. Soon, Zhang Ya was cornered at a space that was nowhere close to the door. She screamed loudly for help, but it was not answered. The girls acted like they did not even hear her.The man said many unsavory things as he closed in on Zhang Ya. Zhang Ya\u2019s hands had reached the edge of the window behind her\u2014there was only one exit left.Looking at the scene that played itself on the mirror, Chen Ge was suddenly reminded of the lines that appeared on the black phone when he won the love letter.Her eyes exposed, cheeks white as ash, the moment she fell off the building, she became the taboo of the school. Red dancing shoes and blood-dyed uniform, even her name became something that was only uttered in frantic whispers.The man studied the empty window closely but did not rush down to save Zhang Ya. Instead, he took several steps back to stop beside the five girls, who were in complete shock.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the mirror, the man was the first to recover. He stood before the five girls and started to glare threateningly at them. One of the girls started to weep, so the man yanked her up from the floor and pointed his finger at her face while his lips moved. The girls shook her head vehemently.Then, the girl who was as tall as Zhang Ya stood up. She walked over to the man and started to help him persuade the other girls. From how she carried herself, she seemed to know the man and shared a more than friendly relationship. Perhaps it was even she who planned for the man to appear just after the female teacher left.With the girl\u2019s persuasion and the man\u2019s threat, the other girls finally nodded. After a few more minutes of discussion, the man was the first to leave. The five girls then entered the dressing room to change, and they all left soon after.The mirror returned to normal, but the atmosphere in the dance studio grew tense. Chen Ge could feel the chill coming from his back; it felt like he was carrying a frozen dead body.That\u2019s all?The mirror only recorded what had happened in the dance studio but did not go into what happened next. Chen Ge believed there had to be more than that. After falling from the fourth floor, as long as it wasn\u2019t head first, Zhang Ya still had a chance of being rescued.Red Specter harbors deep resentment\u2026 Maybe the fatty snuffed out Zhang Ya\u2019s last breath because he was afraid of being exposed? The water system of the activities center has been renewed so perhaps the fatty used the system to deal with the body?As the thought cropped up in his mind, Chen Ge rejected it. Zhang Ya was lost inside the school, so the police had to have been involved. Furthermore, cleaning up a body was not as simple as depicted on those crime dramas. Sometimes, the more one tried to hide, the more obvious it became.Chen Ge was curious what happened next, but the mirror had stopped moving.Perhaps I should give Inspector Lee a call. This is a murder, and Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy is within their jurisdiction, so he must have some kind of record.Chen Ge\u2019s idea was not bad, but when he planned to pick up his phone, a scream came from behind him. Zhang Ya\u2019s hair started to twine up his shoulders like snakes curling themselves around his neck and chest, tying them close together.\u201cI\u2019m not leaving; I just want to help you!\u201d Chen Ge argued before his breath was choked out of him. However, the black hair continued to constrict like a boa constrictor suffocating its prey. Perhaps from Zhang Ya\u2019s perspective, this was the only way the two of them could be together\u2014this was true love.Chen Ge had escaped from the wolf\u2019s den to enter the tiger\u2019s cave. Now he understood why Zhang Ya\u2019s love letter was a curse; this lady did not like living man, and the more she loved a man, the greater her desire to kill him.Standing back to back, his limbs too weak to even resist, all Chen Ge could do was to argue his case. \u201cI will help you call the police and have law enforcement provide justice by bringing all who have harmed you to the judgement of law!\u201dThe words felt ineffective even to Chen Ge\u2019s ears. Zhang Ya\u2019s situation was unique. Unlike the family of four at Ping An Apartments, she did not need him for revenge. Those who had harmed her were trapped inside chairs already! And Chen Ge believed she had plenty to do with that.The kind and graceful Zhang Ya had been completely corrupted into a mad specter. Chen Ge did not even dare to imagine the type of disaster that had befallen the five girls before they were trapped inside the chairs.Chen Ge had given up\u2014this was how he was going to go\u2014but as he prepared for death, the black hair stopped attacking.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? There are still people who haven\u2019t received their just punishment?\u201d he uttered quickly, to stress that he would help Zhang Ya capture all those who had harmed her. The black hair started to release as if Zhang Ya was also considering the options. All Chen Ge could do then was wait.The dark dance studio returned to silence. Ten seconds later, an unexpected thing happened. While he was dancing on the line of life and death, the door to the dance studio was suddenly pushed open, and a lanky guy poked his head in to look around.When he saw Chen Ge, a cruel, excited grin lit up his face, and the hand with the peony tattoo pulled out a fruit knife from his back pocket. However, coincidentally, when Chen Ge saw the man, he also smiled, his expression saying\u2014\u2019You\u2019re finally here!\u2019\u201cSurprise to see me? You\u2019ve left too many clues; the bricks on the outer walls had your footsteps, and the window on the first floor of this building had fresh dirt and grass stuck to it. After entering the building, your footprints are practically everywhere. You\u2019re too careless, and now, you shall pay!\u201dThe man standing at the door was naturally Zhang Peng. His eyes were bloodshot, and his mental state was unusually animated. He held the fruit knife in his usable arm. However, to Chen Ge\u2019s surprise, after Zhang Peng said that long speech, as he took the first step into the dance studio, the expression on his face shifted drastically. Earlier, he had been vicious, but now, he retreated worriedly, his eyes glowing with caution and resentment.The mirror monster has taken controlled of his body?Before Chen Ge could react, Zhang Peng started to race down the stairs. He seemed to have spotted something scary. His limbs were twisted in unnatural angles as he ran, which gave him the impression of a puppet being pulled along by his master.The black hair around Chen Ge disappeared, along with the girl behind him. All he could see was a red flash across the mirror; a chase seemed to have begun. The chilliness from his back gradually dissipated, and life returned to Chen Ge\u2019s frozen limbs. He picked up his phone and backpack before racing toward the stairs, his speed no less than Zhang Peng\u2019s.This Bloody Heart Mission will have to be put on the backburner for now. If I truly earn Zhang Ya\u2019s affection, my life in the future will be a little too exciting for me to handle.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChen Ge dashed out of the Activities Centre. He took a glance at the surrounding dark forest and used his phone to call Inspector Lee.The phone rang once before it was picked up, and Inspector Lee\u2019s voice came through. \u201cXiao Chen? Did you run into Zhang Peng?\u201d\u201cWestern Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy! Zhang Peng is here! Other than that, I have something important to tell you,\u201d Chen Ge said through heavy breaths as he raced toward the school gate.\u201cFu Jun, Da Yong, contact the investigation team immediately.\u201d Inspector Lee didn\u2019t hang up. After he gave his orders, he returned his attention to Chen Ge. \u201cWhat is this other thing you want to talk about?\u201d\u201cI discovered another murder case at Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If the victim\u2019s family had asked for an autopsy, we should have the record of it somewhere.\u201d Inspector Lee didn\u2019t hang up as he turned on the lights of the records room to search for the files. He finally found something five minutes later. \u201cWait, why does Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy sound so familiar? Xiao Chen, get out of that school now!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already heading for the gate, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cThat school is just weird; I can\u2019t explain it to you in just a few sentences, but I can give you a number. Six people committed suicide within the span of two weeks at that school, and their deaths were all very weird.\u201dThe sound of paper flipping could be heard through the phone as Inspector Lee looked through the files.\u201cThat sounds about right! That number fits what I\u2019m thinking.\u201d The school gate was within Chen Ge\u2019s view\u2014he could exit the place soon.\u201cFits what you\u2019re thinking? What exactly is happening over there?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mind that, check whether the name of the first suicide victim is Zhang Ya or not.\u201d Chen Ge was in a hurry to confirm his suspicion.Inspector Lee double-checked the records before replying. \u201cIndeed, the name is Zhang Ya, but she did die from a fall. It is a suicide because the mortician did not find any other wounds on her body. On the day of the discovery, the police did visit the crime scene for investigation. The girl fell from the fourth floor\u2019s dance studio; the window she fell from was undamaged, and the soundproof foam around it wasn\u2019t showed no signs of cleaning. So, from this, we confirmed Zhang Ya jumped out of the building without outside influence.\u201d\u201cWithout outside influence? Inspector Lee, have you considered that she was forced to do so? If she didn\u2019t jump, she would have been raped!\u201d Chen Ge relayed the scenes he had seen in the mirror.\u201cWe considered that as well, and there are testimonies from Zhang Ya\u2019s roommates in the records. All five girls said that they didn\u2019t know anything. Zhang Ya jumped off the building after their class was over, so Zhang Ya was inside the studio alone. According to their testimonies, Zhang Ya had always suffered from high stress, was prone to solitude, and was perhaps even mentally unstable. To confirm their testimonies, the police at the time even verified their accounts with the girls from the class, and everyone agreed.\u201d\u201cZhang Ya is definitely not the person they described; they all banded together to frame her!\u201d Zhang Ya was feeling indignant on Zhang Ya\u2019s behalf. He did not expect that the whole class would gang up on Zhang Ya; the girl didn\u2019t even do anything wrong.\u201cWhat kind of person Zhang Ya was, you and I will never know, but the evidence doesn\u2019t lie.\u201d Inspector Lee didn\u2019t understand why Chen Ge was so agitated. \u201cIn any case, get out of that school as soon as you can. We\u2019re sending our men to come fetch you.\u201d\u201cThey were all lying! Take a closer look at Zhang Ya\u2019s time of death, it should be before the class was over! They lied on the time of death, so those five girls were accomplices!\u201d The volume of Chen Ge\u2019s voice inadvertently increased.\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. Zhang Ya\u2019s time of death was between 6 pm and 8 pm. Those five girls left school at around 5.30 pm, their usual time of departure.\u201d Inspector Lee didn\u2019t know how happened to Chen Ge at the school, so he stood from an outsider\u2019s perspective to analyze the situation.\u201cImpossible!\u201d\u201cIt is indeed possible. The mortician conducted a detailed analysis based on livor mortis and rigor mortis. Zhang Ya\u2019s time of death is indeed between 6 pm and 8 pm. The cause of death was a broken spine. Other than that, there were wounds to her skull, calcaneus, and hipbone, all common injuries suffered by suicide victims that died from falling.\u201dChen Ge had no way to retort. He stopped where he was. \u201cIf Zhang Ya did jump off the building before the five girls left, this means that she didn\u2019t die instantly after the fall. However, due to the broken bones that incapacitated her body, she could only lie in a pool of her own blood as she waited for death to come, tortured by pain and heartache until she truly died around 6 to 8 pm.\u201d\u201cYour hypothetical scenario is possible, but you have forgotten one thing. If the girl still had a breath in her after she fell off the building, why wouldn\u2019t the five girls who were there save her? Even if they had their own reasons not to save her, other people at the school would have discovered her.\u201d\u201cIt was a holiday, and the school was deserted other than the six of them who were at school to practice for the upcoming state-wide competition. Their teacher had already left beforehand, and even if there were guards or someone of the sort, isn\u2019t it possible that they were sent away by people with ill intentions?\u201d Chen Ge posed a differing opinion.\u201cI\u2019m not going to argue that with you; after all, it is a moot point arguing whether Zhang Ya died from suicide or murder. You believe those five girls were the real murderers in Zhang Ya\u2019s death and collaborated with each other to provide false testimony, but two weeks after that, these five girls died one after another. The real murderers you assumed are now dead, so how are we supposed to investigate this case?\u201d Inspector Lee was more worried about Chen Ge\u2019s safety.\u201cInspector Lee, I never said that these five girls are the murderers; they are merely accomplices! The real murderer who caused Zhang Ya\u2019s death is a fatty that is 1.8 meters tall with a slouched back!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s quite a detailed description, mind telling me how you came to that conclusion? Four years ago, the security at Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy hadn\u2019t been completed yet, and all the witnesses are now dead. But you\u2019re telling me there\u2019s a real murderer on the run\u2026 how do you expect me to believe you?\u201dInspector Lee had worked overtime for the past few days already thanks to the Ping An Apartments\u2019 case. It was why he was still at the station even at 2 am. Lethargy could be heard laced in his words.Chen Ge could discern the suspicion in Inspector Lee\u2019s voice. \u201cWe can start by investigating the people who are related to Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy from four years ago; we have to find this person! He was at the crime scene!\u201d\u201cChen Ge, starting a police investigation is not a game. Do you know how difficult it is to reopen a case that was closed four years ago? Even if you can convince me, it\u2019ll be pointless if you cannot convince my superiors. What we need is actual proof\u2014not suspicion, not speculation.\u201d\u201cEverything that I\u2019ve said is the truth.\u201d\u201cThat is according to you.\u201d Inspector Lee had started rearranging the files to put them back where they were. \u201cDo you mind telling me why you are suddenly so interested in this case? You don\u2019t give me the impression of a young man who is filled with a sense of justice.\u201dWhy am I so insistent?\u00a0Chen Ge was startled by this sudden question from Inspector Lee. He was reminded of the aid that Zhang Ya had lent him when he was trapped inside the wooden hut as well as the chilling loneliness coming from his back when Zhang Ya was standing behind him inside the dance studio.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. In the current circumstances, the only person who can help her and come to her aid is me.\u201d Chen Ge looked at the black phone.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI still don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying.\u201d Inspector Lee continued after a long pause. \u201cBut holding up justice is the job of law enforcement. Since you\u2019ve brought up the suspicion, after the case on Ping An Apartments is wrapped up, I\u2019ll personally help you look into this.\u201d\u201cThank you, Uncle San Bao!\u201d Chen Ge sighed in relief. \u201cCapturing the real murderer, I suppose is giving Zhang Ya some kind of release. With regards to this godforsaken place, I really don\u2019t want to return again.\u201dHe hung up the phone and turned to look at Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy one last time.To his shock, Red Specter Zhang Ya was just standing behind him!There were about three meters between them. Fresh blood dripping on her school uniform, Zhang Ya looked at Chen Ge with her head tilted. This time, she didn\u2019t move closer, and her expression was a bit weird.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He laughed awkwardly and said, \u201cI came out for fresh air because the dance studio was a bit too stuffy.\u201dThe red blood trailed down her uniform as Zhang Ya stared at Chen Ge. Then she raised her slender, pale arm to point at the building that Chen Ge knew as the teachers\u2019 lounge.\u201cYou want me to go there?\u201d Before Chen Ge could get an answer, Zhang Ya disappeared. Chen Ge was several meters away from the gate, so he was caught in a conundrum. If he returned to the school to investigate, he might run into more danger, but if he just left like that, he would feel so unsatisfied.Zhang Ya\u2019s attitude toward me seems to have softened. Her hint should be related to the case four years ago. However, this school seems to have another presence similar to Zhang Ya, and there is more than one. I should probably wait for the police to arrive first before I go back in.After jumping out of the school, Chen Ge stood on guard outside the gate. He wasn\u2019t sure whether Zhang Peng was still alive or not, so he did not dare let his guard down. Fifteen minutes later, the blinding headlights of a car cut through the darkness; two police cars were heading his way.Chen Ge jumped out into the road and waved the flashlight on his phone. \u201cI\u2019m here!\u201dThe cars stopped at the gate to Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy, and Inspector Lee, as well as an officer Chen Ge hadn\u2019t seen before, stepped out from the car.\u201cUncle Lee, you\u2019re so fast.\u201d According to Chen Ge\u2019s calculations, the police should have required another half an hour before to get there.\u201cWe received a distress call from a taxi driver earlier, saying he was getting robbed, so we were already on the way to this place.\u201d Inspector Lee had heavy circles under his eyes, signs that he had overworked himself for the past few days.\u201cIs that so? In any case, come in quick, Zhang Peng should be still inside the school!\u201d Chen Ge pointed at the abandoned school\u2019s gate\u2014one might have thought he was the host inviting the guests into his house.\u201cDa Yong,\u201d Inspector Lee said, and a muscular police officer who was about 1.9 meters tall pulled out a clipper from the car\u2019s trunk. \u201cAfter entering the school compound, we\u2019ll need to be very careful. The suspect is very cunning, so stick together in pairs.\u201dHe turned to look at Chen Ge. \u201cWhere is the last place you saw the suspect?\u201d\u201cAt the dance studio, but he has run away already. In any case, I have something else to report to you.\u201d Chen Ge walked to Inspector Lee\u2019s side and pointed at the teacher\u2019s lounge. \u201cInspector Lee, do you mind following me?\u201d\u201cDa Yong, you stay behind to watch over the road, others move out according to plan.\u201d Inspector Lee issued his orders, and then he followed Chen Ge into the teachers\u2019 lounge.This building only had three floors, but the interior d\u00e9cor was much more high class than the other buildings Chen Ge had been in.Inspector Lee held the flashlight in his hand and asked, \u201cWhy are we here? Did you see the suspect run this way?\u201dHis gaze was sharp, and the tiredness fell from the man. Once he entered the crime scene, Inspector Lee seemed to morph into another person.\u201cZhang Peng won\u2019t have come here.\u201d Chen Ge walked ahead, trying to pinpoint the exact room Zhang Ya\u2019s finger had pointed at. \u201cI\u2019m bringing you to the place that\u2019s related to the death of the girl four years ago.\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t I said I will help you investigate that after we capture Zhang Peng? The two cases cannot be mixed together, and the most important thing now is to capture Zhang Peng.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re here; this is the room.\u201d Chen Ge didn\u2019t answer Inspector Lee. He had waited for the police to come because he wanted to lower the risk to its bare minimum. The sign on the door said that this was the storeroom for gym equipment. After pulling off the seals and kicking the door open, Chen Ge and Inspector Lee walked into the room.Numerous balls littered the room, and exercise equipment like tennis rackets and ping pong paddles hung from the walls.\u201cYou brought me here to see this?\u201d Inspector Lee used his flashlight to scan the corners of the room. \u201cWhat can it prove?\u201d\u201cGym equipment\u2026\u201d Chen Ge walked to the center of the room and started ransacking the place. He stopped when he reached a single bed that was placed next to the innermost cupboard. There was also such a bed inside the dance studio; it looked specially made because the bedframe was slender than most normal bedframes.\u201cWhy is there a need for a bed inside the storeroom?\u201d Chen Ge frowned with confusion before lifting up the bed\u2019s wooden boards. A harrowing scene revealed itself before their eyes.Underneath the worn and dusty bedframe hid ten female ballet shoes of differing sizes, and a pair of them had been dyed black by blood!\u201cThat many of them?\u201d Looking at the shoes that appeared to have been purposely hidden underneath the bed, Chen Ge did not feel anger but shock, shock that the incident at Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy might be more distressing than he had assumed.\u201cThere\u2019s more than one victim!\u201d Chen Ge asked Inspector Lee, \u201cWhy would the ballet shoes of the suicide girl be hidden here? Was there any mention of the girl\u2019s shoes in the case report?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no record on the shoes.\u201d Inspector Lee frowned. \u201cThe shoes are all covered with dust even though they are hidden under the bed; this means that they have probably been left here for a long time already. However, they were placed neatly in a row, like someone took special care to look after them\u2026 perhaps this is the murderer\u2019s fetish.\u201d\u201cUncle Lee, you\u2019re the police officer here, so you have to help return justice to the victims.\u201d Chen Ge dropped the boards to the side. \u201cThe murderer had free access to the dance studio as well as this equipment storeroom, so he was probably a manager or guard.\u201d\u201cIf what you\u2019re saying is true, then that does narrow down the investigation scope quite a bit.\u201d Inspector Lee seemed to have been moved by the pair of darkened dancing shoes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will not rest until I get to the bottom of this case. No matter who the murderer is, I\u2019ll have him punished to the full extent of the law!\u201dWhen Inspector Lee said that, Chen Ge\u2019s black phone vibrated. He pulled it out to glance at it. There was a new message on the phone.\u201cManaged to locate Zhang Ya\u2019s red dancing shoes before dawn.

You can write something you want her to do in Zhang Ya\u2019s personal profile page (Note: It mustn\u2019t be against Zhang Ya\u2019s will).\u201dChen Ge silently retreated to the door.\u00a0Tonight\u2019s experience might have been harrowing, but at least the result is good.He opened up Zhang Ya\u2019s personal page, and the display turned red immediately.\u00a0My demand mustn\u2019t be against Zhang Ya\u2019s will\u2014that\u2019s the only requirement.After some thought, Chen Ge wrote, \u201cI hope Zhang Ya will listen to me forever.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but your demand is against Zhang Ya\u2019s will, please change it.\u201d\u201cI hope Zhang Ya will protect me from being harmed.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but your demand is against Zhang Ya\u2019s will, please change it.\u201d\u201cI hope Zhang Ya will not harm me or harbor any intention to kill me!\u201dThat\u2019s doable, right?\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but your demand is against Zhang Ya\u2019s will, please change it.\u201dEr\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He would continue the research when he was back at his Haunted House. To his surprise, when he exited Zhang Ya\u2019s personal page, there was another unread alert on the black phone.Haven\u2019t I finished the Bloody Heart Mission already?Chen Ge opened the second message without much thought.\u201cThe Specter\u2019s Favored, congratulations for completing Rare Level Ghost, Red Specter\u2019s Bloody Heart Mission. This mission is part of a side mission for a four-star scenario\u2014School of the Afterlife!\u201cNote: When the Bloody Heart Mission\u2019s completion rate reaches one hundred percent, it\u2019ll unlock the Trial Mission for School of the Afterlife (Mission effective time is three months).

Mission Venue: Western Jiujiang\u2019s Medical University.\u201cLast Mission: Currently Locked.\u201dReading the series of message on the black phone, Chen Ge was baffled.\u00a0Four-star scenario\u203d Even a one-star scenario manages to cause forensic science students to faint, so just how scary will a four-star scenario be?Everyone has a threshold with regards to horror; once that threshold is overshot, it might be harmful to the person\u2019s health. Chen Ge read the various Side Missions again, and just the mission description alone made his skin crawl. Most importantly, these were just Side Missions; the finale was still locked. Logically speaking, Chen Ge had to finish the eight Side Missions first before he could unlock the final mission.A four-star scenario is probably too hard for the current me. Perhaps I\u2019ll be able to challenge later but definitely not now.Chen Ge closed the message and clicked into the unlockable scenario tab. Other than The Third Sick Hall and The Haunted Hearse, there was now an additional School of the Afterlife, but different from the previous two, this scenario\u2019s name was written in blood-red ink.So, this one scenario practically collects all the haunted school stories into one. In that case, even after this scenario is unlocked, it probably can\u2019t be released to every member of the public.Looking at the Scream Factor delineation of the various scenarios, a thought bubbled up in Chen Ge\u2019s mind. One-star scenario should be open to anyone, but entrance to scenarios that were three stars or above should be limited to those who had survived one- and two-star scenarios. In other words, this could be considered a type of visitor protection.The playability of the Haunted House will be increased in this manner as well. Those who have visited once may return to challenge a scarier scenario until they perfect every scenario. This means that they will have a different experience every time they visit, and this will definitely boost the popularity of my Haunted House.Suddenly, He San\u2019s image appeared in Chen Ge\u2019s mind. He was technically the only visitor who had challenged more than one of the Haunted House\u2019s scenarios.\u00a0That kid is somewhat of a good luck charm of the Haunted House. Perhaps I should invite him again when the new scenario is unlocked\u2026There were many fresh ideas in his mind, like giving additional rewards and certificates after the visitors survived certain levels. This way it would encourage the visitors to breakthrough to challenge scarier scenarios.This makes me feel like some kind of dungeon master.Chen Ge couldn\u2019t help but smile. In the future, there would probably be professional teams who came to his Haunted House to understand the true meaning of fear.\u201cWhy are you smiling dumbly to yourself? Looks like you up to some kind of no good.\u201d Inspector Lee came out from the room. He had completed the initial survey. \u201cI\u2019ve communicated with Team 1 and Team 2; they couldn\u2019t find any trace of Zhang Peng. The atmosphere of this school weirds me out, and the environment is too complicated to navigate at night. We\u2019ll retreat for now and set up a plan when the investigation team gets here.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Chen Ge had prepared to leave for a long time already. All his reasons for being there had been accomplished.Everyone thus retreated from the school grounds. The police sealed the gate, waiting for aid to arrive. The investigation team finally arrived when dawn came, and they looked as exhausted as Inspector Lee\u2019s group.After a simple greeting, Inspector Lee drove Chen Ge home in his car.\u201cYet another sleepless night.\u201d Chen Ge finally relaxed when he was sitting in the backseat of the police car. He stretched lazily before lying down on the cushion.\u201cYou\u2019re the first person that I\u2019ve come across who can be so comfortable inside a police car,\u201d Inspector Lee commented with a degree of dissatisfaction. \u201cBy the way, I have a few questions that I haven\u2019t had the chance to ask you until now.\u201d\u201cThen, don\u2019t ask.\u201d Chen Ge could already guess the questions. He used his backpack to smother his face and pretend to fall asleep.\u201cWhy would you go to Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy at midnight? And how did you know the exact time of death of the girl? This was four years ago, and even the forensic doctor wouldn\u2019t be able to tell me the time of death without referring to the case file, but you managed to do that. That\u2019s just too abnormal.\u201d Inspector Lee crawled into the driver\u2019s seat and started the engine.\u201cLucky guesses.\u201d Chen Ge turned his body about. \u201cUncle San Bao, can you turn the air-conditioning on?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou\u2019ve dropped all formalities around me, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Inspector Lee grumbled as he turned on the air-conditioning. It was then that his phone suddenly rang.\u201cUncle, it\u2019s your phone.\u201d\u201cTalk some more and see if I\u2019ll toss you out of the car or not?\u201d Inspector Lee looked at the ID before answering it. He did not say a word, and there was no sound coming from the other end either. The call was ended three seconds later.\u201cWho is so brave to make prank calls to the police?\u201d Chen Ge turned to look but was surprise to find Inspector Lee\u2019s facial expression had softened.\u201cThat\u2019s my wife. Every time I\u2019m on a special mission, she\u2019ll give me a call to check on my safety. Due to the sensitive nature of certain missions, we\u2019ve come up with our own style of communication. Instead of verbal communication, as long as I pick up the phone, that means that I\u2019m still okay.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You call me uncle and my wife auntie?\u201dHe waited for an answer, but it never came. He turned and realized Chen Ge had already fallen asleep. When the police car arrived at New Century Park, Chen Ge was shaken awake by Inspector Lee. The former left the car in a sort of daze, carrying his backpack.\u201cBe careful at all times! Zhang Peng is still out there. Based on the current situation and his twisted mentality, he might give up everything just to take revenge on you,\u201d Inspector Lee reminded Chen Ge.\u201cI know.\u201d The mention of Zhang Peng did wake Chen Ge up slightly. He waved at Inspector Lee before turning to enter New Century Park. The elderly guard was already asleep. Even as Chen Ge walked through the front door, he did not wake up.Tonight\u2019s reward is quite valuable. I can ask for a favor from Zhang Ya since I\u2019ve completed her Bloody Heart Mission, but would it be too much of a waste to have her eliminate the mirror monster for me?Chen Ge pulled out the black phone and clicked into Zhang Ya\u2019s page. The affection level had been raised from \u201cCrazy about you\u201d to \u201cYours forever.\u201dI\u2019ll need to study this closer so that I maximize the usability of this chance.As he entered the Haunted House, Chen Ge did not exit the page but continued reading through the details on Zhang Ya.When I have enough money, perhaps I should rent myself a room outside. Sleeping in the staff breakroom feels weird after a while,\u00a0Chen Ge thought to himself as he walked down the dark corridor. He was familiar with every corner of this Haunted House; even without light, he wouldn\u2019t knock into anything.When he passed the first-floor toilet, the wooden door creaked as if blown by the wind. The wooden door was not sturdy to begin with, and after being assaulted by Chen Ge using the mallet, the door itself had become misshapen. He tried to close the door as best as he could, but when he walked toward it, he noticed that the window in the toilet was half open.Did I forget to close the window when I left?\u00a0The sky outside the window was brightening. Chen Ge stood at the window to inspect it. He didn\u2019t see anything like a footprint near or on it.\u00a0It\u2019s probably due to the recent high amount of stress.Even so, Chen Ge grabbed the mop that was leaning against the wall as he headed toward the control room. The Haunted House was fitted with cameras that covered every corner. A simple look at them would confirm for Chen Ge whether someone had snuck in or not.Pushing open the control room door, Chen Ge sat before the computer and booted up the computer. All the surveillance footage was stored inside this computer. Chen Ge looked for the ID of the camera at the entrance of the toilet and pulled up the video.He thought he was being overly cautious, but several minutes later, Chen Ge did discover a strange man on screen!The man had his head lowered and quickly rushed down the corridor once he exited the toilet.Someone did come in; there\u2019s another person hiding in this Haunted House other than myself!\u00a0That woke Chen Ge up completely.\u00a0The man seems to know there\u2019s a camera at the entrance of the toilet and knows where he\u2019s going. This means that he has probably been inside the building before.There were several cameras installed on the corridor. After the mysterious man disappeared from the camera, Chen Ge searched for the ID of the next camera, which was placed at the corner of the corridor that led to the toilet. On the second video feed, it was shown that the strange man turned into the control room once he raced down the corridor.He headed for the control room directly, probably to destroy the evidence. This man knows the layout of my Haunted House very well.There was only one name in Chen Ge\u2019s mind, and just as he was about to continue his investigation, he saw himself on screen.The video has rolled onto the present. That\u2019s me holding the black phone and the mop as I entered the control room\u2026 Wait, this means that the man hasn\u2019t left!\u00a0Just as Chen Ge saw himself on screen, he grabbed the mop next to him and turned around!The locker that was about two meters behind him was shoved open, and a man with bloodshot eyes, holding a sharp knife in his hand, jumped out from it!\u201cZhang Peng!\u201d Chen Ge screamed when he saw the man\u2019s twisted features. Probably agitated by Chen Ge\u2019s voice, Zhang Peng charged at him with the knife. Chen Ge calmed down quickly from the initial shock. He opened the room door that was behind him and retreated as he deflected Zhang Peng\u2019s assault.Even though Zhang Peng was handicapped, he fought with the passion of one who did not want his life anymore. The man knew this was the end of the line, and what he wanted now was someone to join him in death. Chen Ge evaded left and right as he moved toward the maintenance room. He looked like he was cornered, but that was part of his plan.Zhang Peng had put his life on the line, so escape was out of question. He needed to fight back, but the wooden mop in his hand wouldn\u2019t harm Zhang Peng, so Chen Ge was reminded of Dr. Skull-cracker\u2019s iron hammer. Earlier, to avoid an unnecessary misunderstanding with the police, Chen Ge had hidden the hammer inside the maintenance room.The assault intensified. Zhang Peng seemed to have seen through Chen Ge\u2019s plan. He did not even attempt to avoid Chen Ge\u2019s hit as he allowed the wooden mop to smack on his body\u2014his aim was to get close to Chen Ge.Very soon, Chen Ge retreated to the door of the maintenance room. He was biding the time to jump into the room, but before that could happen, he felt an extra weight on his body like he was carrying a boulder.\u201cYou\u2019re going to die today!\u201d Zhang Peng, who had been silent, suddenly cried out. Spirit had returned to the man\u2019s eyes, and his knife skill became much more agile.What\u2019s going on? The mirror monster has been controlling Zhang Peng until now? So where is the monster now?\u00a0Chen Ge could feel his movement slowing down. He used his hand to feel behind him, but he couldn\u2019t feel anything. Something pressed hard on his shoulder, causing him to bend over slightly. He turned his head around to look, and a black shadow about the size of an adult man was riding on his back!The mirror monster!Panic flashed across his eyes. Chen Ge dipped to avoid a knife aiming at his neck, and he turned to blast through the door into the maintenance room. He ran toward the cupboards that held all the random junk.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt\u2019s still not time to give up. Zhang Peng and the black shadow share one entity, if I use the hammer to incapacitate Zhang Peng, then I\u2019ll be able to stop the black shadow as well!Chen Ge felt like he was dragging a small mountain on his back. He had underestimated the black shadow\u2019s growth. Compared to the first time they met, this creature had become much harder to deal with.Something was choking the breath from his throat as the weight on his back continued to increase. The laughter of various individuals appeared in his ears, and when Chen Ge reached the cupboard, he was drained from exhaustion.Chen Ge\u2019s consciousness wavered, and a humming sound sung in his ears. Without turning to look, Chen Ge knew Zhang Peng was walking toward him with the knife.The monster on his back continued to press down on him. Chen Ge used every ounce of his energy to open the cupboard door. As he tried to search for the hammer through the junk, the black phone fell from his pocket, the screen still on Zhang Ya\u2019s personal page.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Chen Ge had no time to hesitate. When he saw Zhang Ya\u2019s page, he reached out to type two words\u2014Help me!The weird laugh in his mind grew louder. Zhang Peng\u2019s knife came at him before Chen Ge had the time to key in anything else. He turned around and grabbed anything from the cupboard that he could get his hands on to throw at Zhang Peng.His limbs were failing him, and the veins in Chen Ge\u2019s neck were protruding. Even without the stab from Zhang Peng, he would be strangled by the mirror monster. Chen Ge clawed violently at his neck, but he caught no purchase\u2014it was as if there was nothing there. Chen Ge placed his last hope on the black phone.He turned his head to look at the phone on the ground and saw that there was a line of blood red letters on screen. \u201cShe has understood your demand, so please accept the content of the first agreement.\u201dIt appeared like the demand went both ways. While Chen Ge asked something of Zhang Ya, she would also ask something of Chen Ge, and Chen Ge\u2019s order would only be carried out once the agreement had been reached.At a time like this, no matter how ridiculous the content of Zhang Ya\u2019s agreement was, Chen Ge would agree unhesitatingly. Inching his finger forward, Chen Ge pressed the \u201cyes\u201d button on screen.The moment his finger touched the screen, the temperature of the small room dropped tremendously as cold drafts blew into the room from all corners. The weird laugh in Chen Ge\u2019s head stopped immediately. He could feel the monster on his back shiver; it could also feel fear.The sound of dripping suddenly appeared in the room like something was leaking. The mirror monster on Chen Ge\u2019s back released its hold on Chen Ge and escaped back into Zhang Peng\u2019s body.The maintenance room became eerily quiet. Even Zhang Peng knew something was wrong. This gambler who had nothing to lose did not choose to retreat at the last moment but raise the knife to charge at Chen Ge.However, he only took the first step when the expression on his face changed. The mirror monster had forcibly taken over his body, making him leave. The man and the ghost were quarrelling, forcing them into inaction. While that was happening, Chen Ge\u2019s shadow slowly stood up, and a bloody dress appeared behind Chen Ge.Zhang Ya had probably left quite a heavy trauma on both the man and the ghost at Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy because when they saw the Red Specter behind Chen Ge, a consensus was made, and the man turned to run.Without the constriction from the mirror monster, Chen Ge was released from the lock. He had almost been killed by Zhang Peng, and he was still reeling with anger, so naturally, he wouldn\u2019t let them escape so easily.He just stood up with the iron hammer when the Red Specter made her move. Zhang Ya seemed to have a fetish for cruel kills because even without the order from Chen Ge, needle-like black hairs shot into Zhang Peng\u2019s body.The murderer\u2019s footsteps slowed. Naturally, Chen Ge would not give up on this perfect opportunity. He swung the iron hammer on Zhang Ge\u2019s shoulder. The impact caused the man to fall forward. Making use of this opportunity, Chen Ge aimed yet another strike at Zhang Peng\u2019s upper calf.An ear-splitting shriek escaped from the maintenance room. The mirror monster inside Zhang Peng knew that the man was cornered, so it decided to abandon Zhang Peng and flew toward the toilet.\u201cNot good, there\u2019s a mirror inside the first-floor toilet!\u201dBefore Chen Ge realized what had happened, Zhang Ya started to chase after the mirror monster. This shadow creature seemed to be highly interesting to her.I have to figure out a way to block the mirror.Chen Ge looked around him and spotted the half-full vat of fake blood left in the maintenance room. The toilet\u2019s door creaked in the wind. When Chen Ge arrived, he saw that half of the mirror body had already been punctured by Zhang Ya\u2019s hair, but it was just inches away from the mirror.\u201cYou\u2019re not getting away that easily this time!\u201dUnsure whether it would be of use or not, Chen Ge splashed the fake blood all over the mirror. The black shadow hesitated before the mirror. Before it could react, tendrils of black hair curled around its body like snakes. Chen Ge could barely make out its humanoid shape anymore as it was caught in the hair.The bloody dress fluttered in the wind. After Zhang Ya got bored, she tore the black shadow that was compressed into a ball into two. She swallowed half of it before tearing up the other half into pieces and gently blowing it into Chen Ge\u2019s face.Chen Ge felt like something had entered his eyes, and his body shivered involuntarily from the sudden cold.\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Chen Ge wanted to get an answer from Zhang Ya, but after fulfilling her part of the agreement, this cruel Red Specter disappeared into his shadow.The toilet door was still squeaking on its hinges, but there was nothing left inside the toilet to suggest that the crazy things that Chen Ge had just witnessed had truly happened.Just like that, Zhang Ya ate half of the mirror monster and blew the other half into my eyes.\u00a0Chen Ge looked at the mirror and a sensation that felt like he was dreaming overwhelmed him.\u00a0The mirror monster has been taken care off, so there shouldn\u2019t be a new number that surfaces on the mirror tomorrow night, right?Until now, he could not understand what the numbers meant, but he had a feeling they pointed to a huge secret.After closing the door, Chen Ge used his phone to contact the police. He did not trouble Inspector Lee this time. After all, the man wasn\u2019t a machine; he had been required to deal with more than enough over the past few days already.Leaning against the wall, Chen Ge glanced at Zhang Peng, who lay as if dead on the floor. When the mirror monster left his body, it seemed to have taken something from the man. The man\u2019s eyes looked blankly forward, and his gaze was soulless.I suppose this is a kind of karma.At 6 am, the investigation team from the main city, officers from Western Jiujiang police station, and members of the park\u2019s management all gathered at the entrance of the Haunted House. The last suspect from the Ping An Apartment case had finally been caught.After watching Zhang Peng being hauled into the police car, Chen Ge\u2019s taut nerves finally relaxed. He did not stay to chat but returned to the Haunted House and locked himself in the breakroom.The case at the Ping An Apartment is finally wrapped up. The mirror monster has been eaten by Zhang Ya, so there are no more hidden threats lingering in my Haunted House, meaning I can finally open all of the scenarios up for business in the morning.\u00a0Chen Ge lay in bed, thinking about his future.\u00a0What I should focus on next is the expansion of the Haunted House because the new scenarios won\u2019t be unlocked without the expansion. After I wake up, I should go talk to Uncle Xu. In any case, I have to convince him to let me rent the underground parking lot.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs he tried to fall asleep, Chen Ge felt a cold breeze caress his body. The chill did not leave even when he wrapped himself up in the covers. The chill seemed to come from his eyes.Zhang Ya did blow part of the mirror monster into my face, could this be caused by that?\u00a0Chen Ge grabbed a small piece of mirror to look at his face. Everything looked normal except perhaps his pupils turned darker like the surface of a bottomless lake.Eventually, fatigue caught up to him. Chen Ge placed the mirror underneath his pillow and soon drifted off to sleep.At 10.30 am, before he managed to catch several hours of sleep, Chen Ge was woken up by the call on his phone. He looked at the ID and answered it. \u201cXiao Wan, you can have the morning off. Come back in the afternoon.\u201d\u201cBoss! There are so many people down here!

Wait for me, I\u2019m going down now!\u201d Chen Ge leaned closer to the window to glance down. There was indeed a great crowd outside the Haunted House, and the number was still growing.\u201cBoss, listen to me, surrender while you still can before this gets worse.\u201d\u201cSurrender my foot! Just wait for me.\u201d After hanging up, Chen Ge quickly put on his clothes, washed his face, and ran to the door. He pulled back the heavy curtains and dashed out the gates.When Chen Ge made his appearance, the rowdy crowd started to quiet down. The surrounding visitors looked at Chen Ge with curiosity and more than a bit of disappointment in their eyes. Obviously, they had expected the person who was surrounded by the police to look less\u2026 normal.This was the first time that Chen Ge had felt so many eyes on him. He seemed to shrivel up in shyness, but he felt like he should say something. \u201cDo any of you mind telling me what this is for?\u201d\u201cYou are Chen Ge?\u201d The leading officer carried a box in his arms. He was slightly rotund, but his eyes were sharp and penetrating, which created a rather humorous contrast to his babyish face.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cCan I see your identification?\u201dChen Ge searched for a long time before producing his identification card. All this while, he was silently studying the officer before him. The officer was wearing a uniform different from Inspector Lee and his men.\u201cOkay, thank you for your cooperation.\u201d The officer smiled. He waved at the reporters beside him, opened the box in his hand, and announced in an official tone, \u201cFor providing the murder case at Ping An Apartments with crucial evidence, Jiujiang Municipal Bureau for Public Security is awarding this Level Three Public Security Medal of Honor to Chen Ge! Hopefully, Chen Ge will appreciate this honor and continue to contribute to the maintenance and improvement of the public security of our society!\u201dThis series of announcement confused Chen Ge. Things were happening too quickly for him to handle. As the box was pushed into his hands, he looked at the shiny medal, and there was only one thought on his mind, which was only half-awake.\u00a0Where\u2019s the reward money?The slightly rotund officer stood beside Chen Ge and paraded him to the wall of reporters. The whole process lasted for fifteen minutes. After the crowd dispersed and the reporters left, Chen Ge quietly sought out the rotund officer. \u201cSir, how may I refer to you?\u201d\u201cThe name\u2019s Yan, you can call me Captain Yan. I was classmates with Western Jiujiang\u2019s Ol\u2019 Lee. In fact, he has told me many things about you.\u201d Captain Yan seemed to be a friendly character. His eyes that looked upon Chen Ge were glowing the praise. \u201cThe way you handled the case at Ping An Apartments is impressive. When you were being chased by the killer, your reaction and observation skills surprised both me and Ol\u2019 Lee.\u201dAfter being fed the series of praises, Chen Ge felt too embarrassed to jump to the topic of the reward money. \u201cAll I did was run crazily around the woods. The case wouldn\u2019t have been solved without the police. In fact, I would have been the killer\u2019s latest victim if not for all of you.\u201dAfter the trading of compliments, Captain Yan realized that Chen Ge was still lingering shamelessly around the police car. He smiled to himself because it finally dawned on him why Chen Ge was there. \u201cXiao Chen, you\u2019ll need to go to the main city\u2019s bureau personally to get the reward money. Due to the large scale of the case, it took a while for the reward to be approved, but you can go get it now. I hope you understand.\u201d\u201cOf course, of course.\u201d After knowing where to get the reward money, Chen Ge\u2019s heart that hung in the air finally settled.\u201cI came here today to thank you in person. Every unsolved case is like a boulder pressing on every police officer\u2019s heart, and it\u2019s something passed on from the senior to the junior. Four years ago, I was also involved in this case, so thank you for solving this trouble in my heart.\u201d Captain Yan smiled sincerely. \u201cBy the way, the elder from Ping An Apartment also wished to speak to you. The elder is incapacitated, can no longer move his lower body, and has lost much of his capacity to talk, but his mind is still sharp. He knows it is you who saved him and solved the death of his family. He also wants to thank you in person.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d For Chen Ge, the case was merely a mission dispensed by the black phone, but for the victims and their family, it was a meaningful closure.\u201cYou\u2019d better visit him soon. The elder is currently in hospital. Perhaps it was the emotions that ran high or perhaps the question that has been keeping him alive has been answered\u2026 in any case, he\u2019s not doing so well.\u201dAfter that, Captain Yan got into the car.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll visit him later in the afternoon.\u201d Looking at the special uniform that he wore, Chen Ge felt this Captain Yan carried a greater responsibility than he let on. After the police car left, the park\u2019s workers surrounded Chen Ge.\u201cBoss, are you going to be on television again\u203d\u201d\u201cNot bad, there\u2019s even a medal.\u201dAfter sending them off, Chen Ge found Uncle Xu in the crowd, and he dragged him to a corner to speak.\u201cUncle Xu, what\u2019s the update regarding the rental of the underground parking lot? The money will be coming soon!\u201dThe mention of underground parking lot made Uncle Xu frown. \u201cThis is not the issue of budget. Xiao Chen, I cannot sit idle and watch you jump into your own grave. The visitor number of the park has been steadily dropping, and everyone is trying to flee, don\u2019t you understand that?\u201d\u201cI do understand that, and I know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Chen Ge replied confidently. The Haunted House might carry the key to the disappearance of his parents. Only by continuing to expand it would Chen Ge have the chance and the ability to interact with the other world.\u201cStill so stubborn.\u201d Uncle Xu tried to persuade Chen Ge for a long time, but it was to no avail. In the end, he could only sigh. \u201cCome with me then. Due to the appearance of the police, Mr. Luo is also with us. You might as well talk to him in person.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDirector Luo is here?\u201d Chen Ge had heard his parents mention this actual owner of New Century Park many times already.\u201cWhat do you think? The police set up a security perimeter around the park, did you think they would not inform the management? To provide full cooperation, Director Luo has been staying at the park for the past few days.\u201d Uncle Xu led Chen Ge to a building on the northern side of the park. This was the second tallest structure in the park, behind the Ferris Wheel. \u201cWhen you meet Director Luo later, remember to watch what you say. The less you say, the less likely you\u2019ll make a mistake, you understand?\u201dChen Ge followed Uncle Xu into the elevator that led them up to the top floor. They stopped before the door of an office. The door wasn\u2019t locked. Uncle Xu knocked on it, and very soon, a man in his fifties came out from it.The man was of average height, and his hair was half white. His features were gentle, and the suit he wore was not branded, but it was clean and didn\u2019t have the slightest crease on it.This is Mr. Luo? He looks so different from the picture.\u00a0From how Chen Ge saw it, the man standing before him looked more like a retired teacher.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He wishes to rent the unused underground parking lot.\u201d\u201cI understand. Leave us be, you can go busy yourself with your work.\u201d Director Luo signaled for Uncle Xu to leave.Director Luo had Chen Ge sit on the sofa while he poured two cups of tea. \u201cI\u2019ve been informed you wish to rent the underground parking lot. Do you mind telling me why you plan to do that?\u201d\u201cI wish to expand the Haunted House. I want to build an underground maze inside the parking lot.\u201d\u201cAn underground maze. That\u2019s not a bad idea, but do you have the budget and ability to handle something of that scale? The rental for the space will be small in comparison to the finances you need to set up the place.\u201d Director Luo leaned against the couch, his eyes colored with lethargy and tiredness. \u201cI am not against your idea, and I can rent you the place, but before that, I need to ask you a few questions.\u201dEven though he had gotten a verbal agreement from Director Luo, the man had not yet mentioned the rental amount, so Chen Ge was still nervous. \u201cAsk away.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the owner of a Haunted House, so you know better than I do how high the early investment in a Haunted House is. Also, different from hotels or motels, where you can still sell or reuse the tables, chairs, and utensils, if your Haunted House fails, what are you going to do with the spooky props and items?\u201dDirector Luo did raise a valid concern, something that Chen Ge had not even considered before.\u201cEven if you manage to do a good job reviving the Haunted House, how are you going to solve the issue of returning customers? A Haunted House is a one-time exhaustion product. There might be some initial hype, but it\u2019ll eventually run out because the number of your potential customers is only so big. You\u2019re going to invest greatly into this, are you confident you\u2019ll even earn back your capital?\u201cOne final question, by building your Haunted House underground, how are you going to promote it? Your customer\u2019s number is highly dependent on the park\u2019s visitor number. How is your Haunted House going to survive when the day comes for the park to close?\u201dChen Ge knew that Director Luo was stopping him out of kindness. In fact, he knew that those who advised him against investing in the Haunted House were only looking out for him. They had his best interests at heart.Director Luo\u2019s three questions revolved around Chen Ge\u2019s mind. The first two questions were easily solved with the presence of the black phone, so Chen Ge\u2019s real conundrum was the last question. If New Century Park closed, naturally, his Haunted House would close, too.Moving to another place would be difficult, just the number of documents would cause Chen Ge enormous headaches. Furthermore, his budget was limited; to find another location to fit the black phone\u2019s scenarios would be impossible.\u201cHave you seriously considered these three questions?\u201d Director Luo seemed to anticipate Chen Ge\u2019s answer. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back for now? We mustn\u2019t jump into important decision without detailed research and thorough contemplation.\u201dChen Ge sat unmoved on the couch. He turned to look at Director Luo and asked directly, \u201cIs the park really going to close soon?\u201dDirector Luo did not confirm or deny, but the tiredness in his eyes deepened. \u201cIf I say the park is really closing soon, will you insist on renting the underground parking lot?\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d Chen Ge\u2019s answer surprised Director Luo. \u201cDirector Luo, I already have the solution for your first and second questions. And your third question is not valid.\u201dThere was fire dancing in Chen Ge\u2019s eyes. The young man powered on fearlessly. \u201cMy Haunted House has never relied on anyone else before, and my visitor number will not be entirely dependent on the park. Give me time, and I will not only attract countless visitors to the Haunted House, I will also use it to revive the entire park! Renting the underground parking lot is just the first plan. My plan is to build the world\u2019s first unique theme park that is based on horror and terror.\u201dAfter he finished what he had to say, Chen Ge finally remembered Uncle Xu\u2019s advice\u2014the less you say, the less likely you\u2019ll make a mistake.He looked at Director Luo with uncertainty. He regretted telling him everything that was inside his heart.After listening to Chen Ge, Director Luo put down his cup, and the tiredness in his eyes had disappeared. After a moment\u2019s silence, he suddenly laughed and said, \u201cYou remind me too much of myself when I was young.\u201dHe stood up and walked to open the curtain. The whole park was within view from the office.\u201cI\u2019m the most devastated and most unwilling for the closing of New Century Park.\u201d He opened the window and allowed the wind to ruffle his peppered hair. \u201cThis park means the world to me. If possible, I wish for it to stay open forever.\u201dDirector Luo turned to smile at Chen Ge. His smile was complicated; it was a calm smile of a man who had seen the world rise and fall, one who had surrendered to the vagaries of fate. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about your story. After your parents\u2019 disappearance, you quit your day job to take over their Haunted House. In a way, our stories are very similar, but you are luckier than I am.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe picked up a picture frame from the table. It was the only picture frame in the room. It had the picture of a pair of father and daughter. The father was of average height and had a gentle demean our. The girl in his arms was cute, but her hands were twisted at a painful angle, and there seemed to be no life in her eyes.\u201cThis is my daughter. She suffered from serious aphasia and required a special device to even stand upright. God was harsh on her, but she was a strong little girl who loved to smile, not only to me but to the world.\u201d Director Luo turned to look at the sky outside the window. \u201cBut the world didn\u2019t smile back at her. I used to take my daughter to the garden for walks, but none of the kids wanted to play with her. When she turned to look at me helplessly, I knew that she was afraid, afraid that she had done something wrong and that was why she was being isolated. I didn\u2019t know how to console her, so we only took her out during the rainy days so that she wouldn\u2019t have to face the unfeeling crowd. Perhaps it was then that the thought to build my daughter her very own theme park appeared in my mind.\u201cUnfortunately, she didn\u2019t live to see the day the park was open.\u201d Putting down the frame, Director Luo\u2019s eyes were still surprisingly calm. \u201cMany people don\u2019t understand why I would risk bankruptcy to keep an outdated theme park alive, but I believe perhaps you do.\u201d\u201cI do.\u201d Chen Ge had already stood up earlier. He had not expected that Director Luo would reveal such intimate information to him.\u201cEveryone is trying to find a way out, but you\u2019re different. You\u2019ve surprised me.\u201d After closing the window, Director Luo pulled out a document from his drawer. \u201cActually, when Uncle Xu came to me with your request, I had already approved it. Take it. Come to me if you need any help, but remember, you only have two to three months left.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019ve stamped the document, so it\u2019ll be effective after you sign it. The document is effective until the park closes, so make good use of it and don\u2019t let me down.\u201d Director Luo\u2019s mood seemed to have improved greatly. He poured himself another cup of tea and said, \u201cYou should be quite busy from now on, so I won\u2019t hold you any longer.\u201dWhen Chen Ge exited the office holding the contract, he still could not believe that he had managed to get the park\u2019s underground parking lot without paying a single dime!According to the contract, he was allowed free use of the parking lot as long as the park did not go under. Chen Ge assumed that Director Luo was being so generous because the park would close in another two- or three-months\u2019 time when the new park at Eastern Jiujiang opened.The underground parking lot is a third of the size of the park. Even though it has been abandoned, to be able to rent it for free is still a wonderful surprise!Chen Ge felt his luck had gotten much better after taking care of the mirror monster. He had received a medal of honor, the reward money was coming soon, and he had solved the issue of expansion; everything was looking up.Could it be that removing dirty things can improve my luck?\u00a0Chen Ge did not think that things would be so coincidental; the thought was merely to humor himself.After returning to the Haunted House, Chen Ge started his work for the day. He had Xiao Wan put on the park uniform and stand outside the Haunted House to sell tickets while he roamed through the Murder by Midnight scenario, chasing the visitors about in his Doctor Skull-cracker uniform.Chen Ge exited the Haunted House at 5 pm. He let Xiao Wan leave early before going to get his money.This will be the first time in my life there have been four digits in my bank account. I deserve some celebration tonight.\u00a0\u00a0Chen Ge changed into a clean outfit in the staff breakroom and was about to leave, when he saw a small ragdoll lying beside his bed. The small fella had most of her body hidden underneath the bed like she was playing hide-and-seek.The day is still bright, but you\u2019re out here already.\u00a0Chen Ge was suddenly reminded of the thing Captain Yan had told him that morning.\u00a0The grandpa\u2019s situation seems to be deteriorating, and he has no family around him. I should go pay him a visit.Chen Ge poked Xiaoxiao on her stomach before putting her in his pocket and leaving the Haunted House.At 6:15 pm, Chen Ge exited the bureau with the reward money of 36,000, which was less than he had expected.After purchasing a fruit basket and some milk, Chen Ge departed for Jiujiang People\u2019s Hospital. With the nurse leading the way, he entered a sickbay on the third floor. He was there only to visit the elderly grandfather, but to his surprise, he ran into a familiar face there.\u201cInspector Lee, why are you here?\u201dSitting beside the bed, Inspector Lee was feeding the elder some porridge. He was as careful as a little girl when he took care of the old man.\u201cThis is weird, how come I keep on running into you everywhere I go?\u201d Inspector Lee placed a towel on the elder\u2019s chest. \u201cAfter a good night\u2019s sleep, the station manager saw how tired I was, so he assigned me a lighter job for the day.\u201d\u201cLaw enforcement even cares about things like this?\u201d\u201cThe elder came into the mishap under our watch, so before we can find him a personal care-taker, it\u2019s only fair that we look after him.\u201dInspector Lee tried feeding him twice, but the elder man seemed to have no appetite. He did not force it but put the spoon down to point at Chen Ge, who stood at the door. \u201cSir, this is the young man who provided us with the crucial evidence to solve the case and the young man who called us that night to save you.\u201dWhen he saw Chen Ge, the old man\u2019s arm that was still movable twitched, but it was unclear what he was trying to communicate.\u201cThinking back, I should be thanking the old sir. If not for the fact you broke the bowl at Ping An Apartment to warn me, I wouldn\u2019t have realized how weird things were.\u201d Chen Ge placed the fruit basket and milk on the counter. Looking at the old man who looked like he could depart at any moment, Chen Ge\u2019s heart shook. \u201cInspector Lee, do you mind leaving the room for a minute? I have something personal to talk to the old sir.\u201dInspector Lee did not know what Chen Ge was up to, but due to trust, he walked out without asking any questions. After closing the door, Chen Ge pulled the doll out from his pocket. \u201cOld sir, I brought Xiaoxiao to come see you.\u201dWhen Chen Ge took out Xiaoxiao, the old man in the bed did not show any response, but when his murky eyes fell on the ragdoll, the man\u2019s pupils shook greatly, and a voice that sounded like it came from a broken bellow escaped from the old man\u2019s lips. The arm that could still move reached out as if to grab something.\u201cYou can see her?\u201dChen Ge did not expect this. He had brought Xiaoxiao there to see her family, but he did not expect that the senior would be able to see Xiaoxiao, who possessed the ragdoll!He hurried to the bedside and placed the doll lightly in the old man\u2019s arm. The senior\u2019s arm hugged the doll tightly before he settled down again.According to legends, people are able to see to the other world at the end of their life.The black phone in Chen Ge\u2019s pocket vibrated. He exited the room to give the grandfather and the granddaughter their privacy.\u201cI heard some noises coming from inside the room earlier, what did you tell him? Listen to me, the senior\u2019s situation is very fragile, and he won\u2019t be able to survive too much of a shock.\u201d Inspector Lee stood outside the door. Should things turn awry, he would rush in immediately.\u201cI only brought the old sir the person he wished to see the most.\u201d Chen Ge sat on the bench provided in the corridor and pulled out the black phone. He realized the reason of the vibration was because on the affection page, Yin Xiaoxiao\u2019s affection level had increased from \u2018Slightly Favorable Opinion\u2019 to \u2018Can be Trusted\u2019.The little fella is the most unique Baleful Specter I\u2019ve ever met. I wonder what will happen when I raise her affection level to the maximum.\u00a0Chen Ge returned the phone to his pocket and leaned against the wall. \u201cUncle San Bao, don\u2019t worry, the old sir will recover.\u201d\u201cYou sure are optimistic.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChen Ge and Inspector Lee chatted for a long time. When they entered the room, the senior\u2019s condition had stabilized. He waved at Chen Ge, but nobody understood what he meant.After nodding at the nurse, Chen Ge left with Xiaoxiao. The little fella hid inside the doll, apparently asleep.After getting a quick dinner at the roadside stall, Chen Ge rushed back to the Haunted House.I still haven\u2019t accepted today\u2019s daily mission yet, I wonder if there\u2019s still time.Among the three Daily Missions, the most suitable was definitely the expansion. All he needed to do was choose the direction of expansion and a general location.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Lonelytree\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Millman97Last night, before leaving for Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy, Chen Ge had glossed through the three Daily Missions. The simple mission was to check for hidden security threats; the normal mission was to find a suitable location to expand the Haunted House; the Nightmare mission was to identify the other individual that shared his room.If he wanted the biggest reward, naturally, the Nightmare Mission was the best choice. However, according to his previous two experience, Nightmare Missions had a time requirement, and they were mostly around midnight. Once he missed that period, there was high chance the mission would fail automatically.There\u2019s no need to risk it.\u00a0Chen Ge selected to accept the Normal Mission.\u201cNormal Mission: You\u2019ve achieved the criteria to enable the first expansion of the Haunted House, do search for a suitable location soon!\u201dThis was the first time that Chen Ge had expanded the Haunted House. He did not know how to go about it, and the black phone did not give him any instructions.I can\u2019t find a guide, so it looks like I\u2019ll have to slowly research it on my own.\u00a0Chen Ge looked at the interface of the app, and two places captured his attention.My Team of Ghosts and Ghouls was still empty, which meant that neither Zhang Ya nor Yin Xiaoxiao had become part of the Haunted House. Yin Xiaoxiao was probably because he had not earned enough affection points, while Zhang Ya\u2026 Chen Ge would be thankful if she just stopped trying to kill him, much less asking her to join the Haunted House.The second thing that attracted Chen Ge\u2019s attention was the tab for Haunted House Expansion. The original gray font had turned red. After clicking on it, a sentence appeared on screen.\u201cPlease select the location of the entrance.\u201dIf the words become red, it means that they\u2019re clickable. The location of the entrance you say\u2026The underground parking lot Chen Ge rented was huge, but the only downside was that the entrance to the parking lot was outside of the park. The path was not streamlined, so he planned to open a new path underneath the Haunted House, one that directly led to the underground parking lot.Normally, large attractions like rollercoasters or Ferris Wheels were not allowed to have any space underneath them, but since the Haunted House was located at the isolated corner, it was the sole exception at New Century Park. In fact, the space right underneath Chen Ge\u2019s building was the parking lot.Holding the black phone, Chen Ge walked to the entrance to the Night of the Living Dead scenario that was on the first floor. After gaining the two one-star scenarios, Minghun and Murder by Midnight, this scenario had pretty much been abandoned.I\u2019ll set the door beside the entrance to this scenario. If it is necessary in the future, I can just remove and replace the Night of the Living Dead scenario.That was Chen Ge\u2019s plan. He used a piece of chalk to mark out an area on the floor, but he realized after drawing it that he had no way of communicating his plan to the black phone. Since he received the mysterious phone, it had been a one-way communication.Have I missed something?\u00a0Chen Ge clicked through the app. When he tried tapping the home page twice, the Haunted House that was used as the background suddenly zoomed out until Chen Ge could see its layout, which was similar to his actual Haunted House, including the locations and set-up of the many scenarios.So, I do it here?Chen Ge found the scenario for Night of the Living Dead on screen. He clicked on an empty space beside the entrance, and a question instantly popped up on screen.\u201cAre you sure you want to place the entrance here?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cPlease select the expansion direction.\u201d\u201cDownward.\u201dAfter making his choice, the screen returned to normal, and several other messages popped up.\u201cOnly through continuous expansion will your Haunted House be able to play host to more homeless spirits and thus collect more screams. Congratulations for completing the Normal Mission. Obtained reward\u2014A free spin at the Wheel of Misfortune!\u201cCongratulations for completing your first ever expansion. Special reward, a unique construct obtained\u2014Midnight Ticket Counter (Broken)!\u201cMidnight Ticket Counter (Broken): There\u2019s a one in one thousand chance for you to attract special \u2018visitors\u2019. They are different from others and might lend you a helping hand.\u201dChen Ge read the messages carefully. The mission had rewarded him with a free spin at the Wheel of Misfortune, but there was too much of uncertainty to this reward. Only by trading a hundred Screams would he get the chance to spin it once. According to the description on the phone, there were definitely some useful things that could be won from the lucky draw.However, even Chen Ge had scared himself with how \u2018lucky\u2019 he was. What if he won another cursed love letter?The two baleful specters might just split himself perfectly in half so that each of them could have their way with him equally. An image of the two spirits holding bloodied knives in their hands arguing over who would lay claim to his skull and body appeared in his mind.Too soon, too soon.The Wheel of Misfortune was thus put on the backburner, so Chen Ge turned to look at the other reward\u2014the broken Midnight Ticket Counter. His Haunted House had been missing a specialized ticket counter. After all, before obtaining the black phone, he had at most ten visitors in a week, hence there was no reason to build a ticket counter.The black phone has helped me solve a problem, but what is the meaning of this one in one thousand chance of attracting special visitors? Does it mean ghosts?Chen Ge purposely walked to the front door, but the gate had remained the same; nothing had changed.\u00a0Perhaps the change will happen after midnight like how it did with the Murder by Midnight scenario.Since he had received the rewards, Chen Ge stopped worrying about them. He cleaned the place while waiting for midnight to arrive. Even though the mirror monster had been vanquished, it did not mean that the number on the mirror would disappear.Chen Ge rolled up his sleeves as he cleaned the fake blood off the toilet\u2019s mirror.He was acting in such a hurry because there had been a little incident that afternoon. A visitor had asked to use the toilet when he was inside the Haunted House. Chen Ge had led him to the toilet, but when the man had seen the fake blood that pooled around the floor, he had refused to enter the toilet. He had held his pee in until his face was green as Chen Ge led him out of the Haunted House.\u201cThe scary places should be scary, but other places should be as comfortable as possible. After all, we\u2019re in the service business.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThat was some advice that Chen Ge\u2019s father had once given him, and he remembered it to this day.Chen Ge finished cleaning the fake blood at around 11 pm. He also fixed the broken toilet door. Then he stood before the mirror with his phone.He checked his profile on the video-sharing app. His number of followers was slowly increasingly, and his videos were heavily shared. In fact, some advertisers had come to him with offers already.I need to pay attention to the videos and livestreams as well. After all, they\u2019re my main source of promotion.When it was 11:59 pm, Chen Ge put away his phone and stood before the mirror. Similar to his first Nightmare mission, he locked the toilet from within and turned off all the lights.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He stared unblinkingly at the mirror before him. When the clock struck 12, the mirror turned blurry like it was starting to mist. Then, a number appeared in the middle of the mirror\u20140.The changing number surprised Chen Ge. He had thought this number was something left behind by the mirror monster. Since the monster had been consumed by Zhang Ya already, the number should have disappeared along with it.The number has nothing to do with the mirror monster?\u00a0He took out his phone to snap a picture of the number, but as he raised his arms, his whole body froze. The reflection in the mirror shifted from reality, and the door to one of the cubicles turned red!It was a red that was unmistakable; it was as if the cubicle was filled with blood, and fresh blood was still leaking out from the cervices.Why would this change happen to the cubicle with the squatting toilet?Using his phone to record this curious phenomenon, he slowly turned around to slowly push open the cubicle\u2019s door.As the door in reality was pushed open, so was the door in the mirror. There was nothing inside the cubicle in reality, but in the mirror, everything inside the cubicle was dyed red, including the toilet paper holder, the toilet paper, the flush, and even the small advertisements pasted on the wall.In the darkened room, the blood red cubicle was exceptionally eye-grabbing.Chen Ge did not understand what was happening. He took a cautious step forward, and when half of his upper body reached into the cubicle, a strange sensation overwhelmed him. Something sticky covered his skin like he was being swallowed and compressed.He immediately retreated, and one minute later, the cubicle in the mirror returned to normal. When Chen Ge walked into the cubicle again, the strange sensation was no longer there. The red door in the mirror only appeared for one minute after midnight, and everything returned to normal after that.Why would the cubicle door in the mirror turn red? And beyond that, even the walls and paraphernalia behind it were all blood red.\u00a0Chen Ge switched on the light. He leaned against the window and started to think.\u00a0Could that be the mirror world? The mirror monster escaped from this blood red world?To confirm his suspicion, he searched for the details of his first Nightmare Mission on the black phone.\u201cIt requires plenty of courage, incredible luck, and a bit of luck to see the hidden world.\u201dThen, there\u2019s a high chance that the hidden world mentioned in the phone refers to the blood red world inside the cubicle.Chen Ge tried to think back to the situation that night. Even though he did not open his eyes, he did pay plenty of attention to his surroundings with his ears.Thinking back, I do remember hearing the cubicle door creak! It was also after that noise that weird things started to happen.At the time, Chen Ge had assumed it was the wind, but now he revised his theory. Perhaps the cause of the creaking was the mirror monster escaping the blood red world.The mirror is most likely the buffer space between the two worlds. The cubicle in the mirror was opened, and the monster escaped from the blood red world. However, due to the disruption from the doll, it was trapped inside the mirror.\u00a0Chen Ge looked at the wooden door of the cubicle in question, and a weird thought cropped up his mind.\u00a0What if I enter the cubicle in the real world when the door turns red in the mirror? Will that transport me to the other world?Shaking that crazy thought out of his mind, Chen Ge returned to stand before the mirror.\u00a0The blood red cubicle appeared in the mirror after the number dropped to zero. Looks like all my previous speculation was wrong\u2014the number has nothing to do with killing. It is probably a countdown, perhaps representing how many more days the mirror monster could exist in the real world.The door in the mirror had returned to normal, but Chen Ge did not dare assume that it would not appear again. There was a possibility that it would continue to appear every night at midnight as long as the mirror monster did not return to it.If it continues to appear tomorrow night, I\u2019ll need to remove the mirror; that\u2019s the only thing I can do now.\u00a0Chen Ge found a heavy black cloth to cover the mirror and left the toilet. After returning to the staff breakroom, Chen Ge pulled out the black phone to check the newly refreshed Daily Missions.Easy Mission: A normal Haunted House experience should not create permanent trauma to its visitors; I hope you understand this simple theory. Please improve the Haunted House\u2019s security by inspecting the security threats hidden around the Haunted House.Normal Mission: A single hand cannot clap. A good Haunted House needs a good management team. Recruit more talents; they will definitely help when the situation demands it.Nightmare Mission: There has always been a second occupant inside your room, wouldn\u2019t you like to meet said person?Chen Ge was familiar with these three missions. He was conflicted. Nightmare Mission was the best choice if he wanted to expand his Haunted House faster, but after the incident with the mirror monster, he was wary of choosing Nightmare Missions.I\u2019ll think about it tomorrow; I deserve a good sleep tonight.Ever since he received the black phone, Chen Ge had not had a good night\u2019s sleep. If this continued, his physical body might not be able to withstand it.Pulling the sheet around him, Chen Ge soon fell asleep.The next morning at 8 am, Chen Ge, who was fully recovered, rushed out of his room. The first place he visited was the entrance to the Night of the Living Dead scenario. The space that he had selected last night had experienced some changes\u2014there was now an additional path leading downward.The black phone sure is effective.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA tunnel had been dug through the ground. He walked down the stairs and soon reached the abandoned underground parking lot. The space was empty and destitute, and there was barely a working light.That\u2019s it? The expansion is only adding a set of stairs?\u00a0Chen Ge was rather disappointed, but reminding himself that the large space was his to toy with relit his passion and desire.\u00a0There are three more months until Eastern Jiujiang\u2019s Virtual Reality Futuristic Carnival is completed. I\u2019ll need to unlock as many scenarios as I can within these three months to upgrade the Haunted House to build a theme park that is no less interesting than the opposing park.Returning to the first floor, Chen Ge walked to the Haunted House\u2019s front door with the black phone. Between the gates and the Haunted House\u2019s entrance corridor stood a new semi-transparent wooden construct that was painted black. It looked like two dressers that had been sewn together.This is the Midnight Ticket Counter? It looks so damn crude.Chen Ge opened the door and took a seat within. The interior of the place was so cramped that he felt like he was lying inside an uncomfortable coffin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This black phone keeps on giving weird stuff.Chen Ge exited the counter. The more he looked at the construct, the more he felt it was not made for living souls.\u201cBoss!\u201d Xu Wan jogged toward him in her casual outfit, holding two steaming buns in her hands.Looking at the cheerful Xu Wan, Chen Ge\u2019s mood brightened instantly. This girl tended to be a bit clueless at times, but she had a natural charm that could brighten up the gloomiest of days.Accepting the offering from Xu Wan, Chen Ge chomped on the bun happily. \u201cWhy are you here so early today?\u201d\u201cBoss, look!\u201d Xu Wan sat down beside Chen Ge on the steps. She pulled out her phone to show Chen Ge the long list of news and videos that were all on the case at Ping An Apartments. \u201cThese are all about you, Boss\u2014you\u2019re famous!\u201d\u201cLet me see.\u201d Chen Ge looked at the articles, not expecting the short interview from the day before to have gone viral. \u201cSuch a waste.\u201d\u201cWaste? Why? I think it\u2019s rather swell.\u201d Xu Wan\u2019s face was flushed, probably from the little jog earlier.\u201cAt the time, I was too focused on the reward money that I forgot this was a perfect promotional opportunity,\u201d Chen Ge said grumpily as he swiped through the articles. \u201cIf I knew it would go viral, I would have interrupted Captain Yan to promote our Haunted House! Look at some of these articles, they even got the facts wrong. They didn\u2019t even put down the address of our Haunted House!\u201cXiao Wan, this is your job for the day. Later, we will both go onto these comment sections to announce our identity and drop the address of the Haunted House. Those who come with proof of our comments will get a twenty percent discount!\u201d\u201cThat sounds so unethical\u2026\u201d Xu Wan was embarrassed doing such a thing, but she did end up following Chen Ge\u2019s instructions.At 9 am, when the park opened for business, both of them put away their phones and prepared to work. After opening the gates, Xu Wan finally saw the Midnight Ticket Counter.\u201cBoss, did you make this yesterday?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s ugly, but it\u2019s usable.\u201d\u201cIndeed, I also think it\u2019s about time we have a ticket counter.\u201dLooking at the serious expression on Xu Wan\u2019s face, Chen Ge sighed internally.Such a good worker, never once doubted my words.They both entered the Haunted House. Xu Wan went to put on her make-up while Chen Ge hauled several wooden planks out from the Props Room to block the entrance to the underground parking lot. The new scenarios had not been unlocked yet, so the place still had no use.After all the preparation had been made, it was time to start the day. Even though it was a holiday period, there was already a line in front of the Haunted House. It was not that long a line, but it was already an impressive improvement compared to before.Xu Wan was busy chasing people around as the ghost bride inside the Minghun scenario while Chen Ge had to split himself between selling tickets and scaring people as Doctor Skull-cracker inside the Murder by Midnight scenario. It was harsh maintaining the large Haunted House with just the two of them.It was worth noting that Xiaoxiao would have surprise interactions with the visitors inside the Murder by Midnight scenario. This ragdoll had a penchant of trailing behind the visitors, which worried Chen Ge because he was afraid that the visitors might just snatch her home.The two finally caught a break around noon. Chen Ge checked on the black phone\u2014both reputation and visitor number had increased tremendously, and he wasn\u2019t far from the second expansion.Two workers managing two scenarios is already at its limit. After unlocking the new scenario, I\u2019ll need to recruit new workers.Chen Ge looked at the black phone. The Nightmare Missions were often ridiculous, but Easy and Normal Missions normally would point out the weaknesses of the Haunted House directly, and completing them would improve the establishment.Even the phone has issued a recruitment mission\u2026 looks like I\u2019ll need to get on that soon.\u00a0Ever since the old workers that followed Chen Ge\u2019s parents handed in their resignation, he had been wary of hiring new blood.\u00a0If only Xiaoxiao and Zhang Ya would listen to my commands, they would be the perfect employees.Of course, this was merely a fanciful thought. To have Xiaoxiao and Zhang Ya scare people inside the Haunted House\u2026 Xiaoxiao would be fine, but Zhang Ya would probably create an actual crime scene.My Team of Ghosts and Ghouls is still empty. I wonder when that will change.\u00a0Chen Ge sat on the steps outside the Haunted House. He was catching a much-needed breather before throwing himself back into work.The sun rose to its highest point, and the visitors started to dwindle to avoid the sun. It was then that Chen Ge\u2019s black phone vibrated. He clicked the message open, and the content gave him quite a shock.\u201cThe Midnight Ticket Counter\u2019s effect has been triggered. The first special visitor has appeared! Please make use of this opportunity, the result will be different based on your choice!\u201dThe effect has been triggered? Even at the one in a thousand chance\u203d Based on my previous experience, this cannot be anything good!\u00a0Chen Ge stood up straight like a soldier preparing for war. He scanned around the Haunted House.\u00a0The sun is shining bright, so it cannot be a specter.It was the point of the day when the heat was at its highest. The visitors that walked around the park had visibly decreased.Is it that an arguing couple? The girl is so pretty, but the guy is so ugly; there must be some problem. Who is Uncle Xu talking to? A new worker? How come I have not seen that person before?While Chen Ge was speculating, a skinny, dark-skinned woman about thirty wandered over with light steps.Could it be her?Chen Ge studied the woman\u2019s appearance silently. Her skin was darker in tone, and she was not tall. She gave a reserved smile and was wearing a faded jacket.\u201cHello, how much for a ticket to visit the Haunted House?\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was surprising shrill, but it was not to the point where it would hurt one\u2019s ears.\u201cWe currently have two scenarios; one ticket is 20 RMB, and you can choose which one you would like to experience,\u201d Chen Ge answered with a business smile.\u201cOkay, then give me two tickets.\u201d The woman handed Chen Ge the money.\u201cYou wish to experience both scenarios?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNo, it\u2019s for the both of us.\u201d The woman smiled apologetically as she waved at a boy who looked to be eight or nine. He ran toward her from underneath the shade.The boy was quite shy around people. He stopped beside the woman, but he did not reach out to grab her hand. He just stood there expressionlessly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but our Haunted House has an age requirement\u2014no entry to those under fourteen.\u201d Chen Ge took a look at this boy and had a feeling he was different from normal boys, but he could not pinpoint why he felt that way.\u201cCan you please make an exception for us? This boy loves visiting Haunted Houses. There aren\u2019t that many visitors now, so even if we go in, people won\u2019t notice. I promise we won\u2019t cause any trouble.\u201d\u201cA child that small likes to visit Haunted Houses?\u201d Chen Ge slid the black phone stealthily back into his pocket and shook his head. \u201d I\u2019m sorry, but those are the rules.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even after the woman was rejected firmly by Chen Ge, she and the boy refused to leave.\u201cIt is his wish to visit your Haunted House, and I promised that he could. Can you please show some kindness?\u201d The woman pulled out a 100 note from her purse. \u201cI promise you, it\u2019ll be fine.\u201dChen Ge did not accept the obvious bribe but asked confusedly, \u201cWhy do you insist on entering the Haunted House? The boy is at most eight years old\u2014the environment inside the Haunted House is so complicated that I\u2019m afraid it might scar him for life.\u201dThe woman smiled helplessly but did not answer Chen Ge\u2019s question. Instead, she turned around to rub the boy\u2019s fluffy hair. \u201cFan Yu, shall we go play something else\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish, the boy slapped her hand away. The boy did not like physical contact, even from his family member. No matter how the woman tried to persuade him, the boy stood unmoving at the front of the Haunted House. Occasionally, he might raise his head, and Chen Ge could see fear, inferiority, and a trace of detachment in his eyes.\u201cFan Yu?\u201d Chen Ge\u2019s attention had completely shifted to the boy. This was the first time he had come across such a curious child before. He squatted down to the boy\u2019s level. \u201cCan you please tell me why you want to visit the Haunted House? It is very dark inside the building, and there are scary things.\u201dThe boy averted his eyes, but Chen Ge noticed his gaze kept wandering toward Chen Ge\u2019s shadow. He still had not said a word.The woman was probably afraid that Chen Ge might get offended, so she instantly jumped out to say, \u201cXiao Yu is different from most children\u2014he doesn\u2019t like to talk\u2014so I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Chen Ge realized these two were not going to move unless tossed out by the guards. He wasn\u2019t so cruel as to do that to a woman and a child, so he relented. \u201cHow about this? I will let you enter the building for free, but you are only allowed to visit the outer perimeter, and I will be tagging along.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201d\u201cSign the disclaimer agreements first, both adult and child. Please do not touch any of the props or run amok while you\u2019re inside. Stay close behind me.\u201d Chen Ge gave the two documents to the woman and the boy. Normally, he only needed the signature from the guardian, but to get as much information as he could from the boy, Chen Ge asked for the boy\u2019s signature as well. After signing the agreement, Chen Ge led them into the Minghun scenario.Chen Ge explained the story background to them. The trio stood at the entrance, which was decorated with white lantern. The woman was a bit nervous, observable from the way she gripped her purse. The boy had his head lowered, but it was unknown whether from fear or something else.The dead trees swayed in the wind, and the paper money that littered the floor scrunched under their footsteps. Chen Ge pushed open the entrance to the Siheyuan and explained, \u201cThat is what the interior looks like. Remember not to go in. The park has strict rules that prevent children under the age of fourteen from experiencing the Haunted House.\u201dAs he finished, the little boy, who had been extremely quiet, suddenly rushed into the Siheyuan before the two adults could even stop him.\u201cFan Yu!\u201d The woman ran after him alongside Chen Ge. The boy stopped at the old well inside the courtyard. He had half of his upper body leaning down the well as if he was looking for something.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d The woman apologized profusely to Chen Ge as she tried to yank the boy out from the well. However, the shy boy seemed to have changed into another person. He not only tried his best to swat the woman\u2019s hands away, but in his desperation, his nails clawed her arms until they were bloodied. It appeared like he had gone berserk.\u201cThe boy sure has some huge mood swings.\u201d The well in the Siheyuan was just a prop; it was not even that deep, so Chen Ge was not worried for the child\u2019s safety. He was, however, curious about why the boy was so interested in the well.After three more minutes at the well, the boy released his grasp unwillingly, probably because he did not find what he was looking for. The boy was definitely different from most young boys\u2014he was more excitable at places that were dark and sinister.\u201cSince you\u2019re already inside, then I suppose a little tour won\u2019t hurt.\u201d Chen Ge\u2019s attention was fully focused on the boy. Even among his peers, the boy was of a smaller stature. He had delicate features and large eyes that looked like pure ebony.\u201cThe Minghun scenario is modelled after the traditional Siheyuan, and the East and West Houses are normally meant for the newer generations.\u201d He pushed open the door to the East House, and a female ghost in bridal outfit floated out from behind the door without warning. The woman screamed from shock and staggered back hurriedly.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just an actor.\u201d Chen Ge stopped the bride and whispered, \u201cXu Wan, go take a break for now.\u201d\u201cBoss, couldn\u2019t you at least pretend that you\u2019re scared. Such a buzzkill\u2026\u201d Xu Wan picked up the dress and stepped over the wooden threshold. The boy who was behind Chen Ge rushed forward to stand before Xu Wan and titled his head up to look closely at Xu Wan.\u201cHmm? Boss, why did you let such a small boy in?\u201d Xu Wan was surprised, but only Chen Ge realized how weird this was. The bridal outfit was red as blood, and Xu Wan was in her special make-up. She looked like a dead person. In such a circumstance, the boy did not feel fear but moved forward actively to Xu Wan to take a closer look.\u201cThe kid seems to like me.\u201d Xu Wan smiled at Chen Ge. It was not until Xu Wan left the scenario that the boy pulled his gaze back.\u201cI suppose that\u2019s enough touring for one day. The rest of the place has similar d\u00e9cor, so shall we leave now?\u201d Chen Ge and the woman moved toward the exit, but the boy stopped in the courtyard. He looked left and right as if looking for something.\u201cFan Yu, it\u2019s time to go!\u201dThe boy ignored the woman. He moved back to the old well and continued his search.\u201cIsn\u2019t the boy afraid?\u201d Chen Ge did not rush them but started chatting with the woman. \u201cAre you his mother?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m his aunt. I\u2019m sorry for creating so much trouble. Xiao Yu is a bit different from boys his age. Ever since the accident with his parents several years ago, he has been like this. We\u2019ve been to many doctors, but it was to no avail.\u201d\u201cPsychological problems? If you don\u2019t mind me asking, what happened to his parents?\u201d Chen Ge asked cautiously.\u201cXiao Yu\u2019s parents were both teachers at Mu Yang High School. They disappeared one day and have not been found since. At the time, Xiao Yu was only five. I didn\u2019t how to explain it to him, so I could only lie to him and say that his parents left for some place far away called heaven.\u201d\u201cMu Yang High School\u203d\u201d Chen Ge tensed after hearing these four words.\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of it? There are plenty of rumors about that school. I advised Xiao Yu\u2019s parents from the beginning to seek employment elsewhere, but they refused to listen to me.\u201d The woman\u2019s eyes started to redden from the memory. She stopped talking to Chen Ge and walked toward the boy. \u201cXiao Yu, it\u2019s time to go home.\u201dThe boy stayed stubbornly beside the well. This made Chen Ge even more curious. He squatted down beside the boy and asked, \u201cWhy do you keep looking inside the well? Is there some kind of monster living down there?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFan Yu shook his head. The boy seemed to have let his guard down, standing at the corner that was shaded from the sun.\u201cThen can you tell me why you don\u2019t want to leave the well?\u201dThe boy glanced at a spot behind Chen Ge before answering, \u201cI\u2019m looking for something.\u201d\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d Chen Ge was curious.The boy looked down the dark well for a long time before answering, \u201cHeaven.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His emotions were running wild. He turned around to take a deep breath to calm himself down. Thankfully, the woman did not notice his weird reaction.However, as he turned back around, he lowered his head and saw the boy has been staring at her, the glow in his eyes similar to earlier when he saw Xu Wan in Mortician\u2019s Make-up.\u201cFan Yu, it\u2019s time to go home,\u201d the woman repeated. Finally, the boy moved away from the well. Even though he still had his head lowered, his mood seemed to have improved.However, after they exited the Haunted House and the sunlight fell on the party, the boy returned to how he had been before, silent with an unbridled fear circulating in his eyes. It was hard to tell whether he was afraid of light or living humans.The woman thanked Chen Ge before leading the boy away. After the pair left New Century Park, Chen Ge sighed in relief. The black phone in his pocket vibrated. He sat on the steps as he thought back on what had happened earlier.Looking for heaven inside the well\u2026 perhaps for the boy, this was not meant in a metaphorical manner. After conversing with the woman, Chen Ge knew she had lied to the boy by saying that his parents had gone to somewhere called heaven so that he would not be too sad.She had probably hoped that the boy would come to the realization as he grew up, but things did not go as planned. The boy\u2019s psychological health was stunted\u2014he could no longer be considered a normal young boy. However, the thing that surprised Chen Ge the most was the boy\u2019s answer when he asked what he was doing beside the well.His parents had gone to heaven and the boy kept on searching for heaven inside the well. Did this not prove indirectly that the boy had seen his parents shoved into the well with his own eyes \u203dTheir bodies are inside the well!\u00a0Chen Ge lit a cigarette unknowingly. He did not hurry to call the police but continued his line of speculation.The boy\u2019s parents were both teachers at Mu Yang High School, and one of the side quests activated on the black phone is related to both Mu Yang High School and a well. If this is not a coincidence, then the disappearance of the boy\u2019s parents should be related to Mu Yang High School.Chen Ge took out the black phone, and there was an unread message. He opened it.\u201cDifferent choices lead to different result. The first special visitor has left. You made the correct choice during the visitation period. Congratulations for obtaining the reward! Unlocked Hidden Trial Mission\u2014Mu Yang High School! This mission is part of the four-star scenario, School of the Afterlife\u2019s side mission. Completing it will unlock a two-star scenario, Mu Yang High School, and lower the Trial Mission difficulty for School of the Afterlife.\u201cMu Yang High School Trial Mission (Scream Factor 2 Stars): This scenario has four side missions. Survive after experiencing all of them, and the scenario will be unlocked.\u201cMission Venue: Mu Yang High School.\u201cMission Request: Arrive at the mission venue before 11 pm tonight and survive until dawn.\u201cMission Hint: Everyone has a deep well inside their heart where shameful and unknowable secrets stay buried.\u201cDo you wish to accept the mission?\u201cWarning: Trial Mission is only active for 24 hours. If you do not accept it within 24 hours, you will forfeit the mission, and the scenario will forever be locked.\u201dThe message on the black phone flustered Chen Ge. He did not expect the reward for accepting a special visitor would be the unlocking of a two-star scenario\u2019s Trial Mission. He had already experienced the terror of a Trial Mission at Ping An Apartments. It was much more dangerous than a Nightmare Mission, and Ping An Apartments was merely a one star Trial Mission.Chen Ge memorized all the information on the screen as he looked through the black phone again and again.The previous mission required me to find the murderer while this mission only requires me to stay alive until dawn. It looks simpler in comparison, but the black phone must have its reasons to label this a two-star mission; its level of danger has to be higher than Murder by Midnight\u2019s Trial Mission!To survive, it sounded like a simple demand, but it greatly unsettled Chen Ge. The offer of the Trial Mission would be open only for 24 hours, and this was a great point of contention for Chen Ge. He did not know if surrendering this mission would affect the development of the four-star scenario, School of the Afterlife.Even though based on his current situation, unlocking a four-star scenario was practically impossible, he would still feel pain if he had to surrender it.Forfeiting this mission might mean forfeiting School of the Afterlife. Two losses at once is indeed too big a loss.\u00a0Chen Ge measured the pros and cons in his heart.Not accepting it means losing two scenarios, but if I manage to complete the mission, it means unlocking a two-star scenario, and it will also complete the side missions for School of the Afterlife. The Haunted House requires constant updates to retain the repeat visitors. This two-star scenario comes at the right time, so I should give it a try.New Century Park was facing closure, and he needed to create results within three months, something that was impossible with the current Haunted House. After some thought, Chen Ge decided to accept the mission.After the message disappeared, Chen Ge decided not to waste any more time. He called Xu Wan to inform her to look after the Haunted House for the rest of the day because he had to go somewhere else.The boy was the key that activated the Trial Mission for Mu Yang High School, and Chen Ge believed he would be able to get more information from him. Chen Ge ran out the park entrance and saw the boy and the woman get on a bus.Route 14.Chen Ge hailed a cab and told the driver, \u201cGo to the next stop for Route 14.\u201dThe taxi reached the station arrived earlier than the bus, which arrived one minute later. The bus was crowded, and the woman was holding the boy in her arms as they were squeezed to the back of the bus. They did not discover Chen Ge.Following them home might nab me some surprise discoveries.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChen Ge did not hurry to expose himself but stood at the front of the bus. The bus continued to pass seven stations, and many passengers descended as the surroundings outside the bus became more and more deserted.When they almost reached the final station, the woman and the boy finally got off. They did not walk down the street but turned down a small, secluded path.They live at such a secluded place? Then again, the woman did mention finding many doctors for the boy\u2014that would burn a hole in the family finances.Chen Ge trailed behind them. A short distance later, the woman and the boy suddenly increased in pace.Have I been discovered? Or are they hiding from something else?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Afraid of being left behind, Chen Ge also picked up the pace. After many turns, a squat two-story terrace block appeared before his eyes, and it was into this place that the woman and the boy disappeared.The drains surrounding the building were fetid with a horrible stench, and a large poster stating that the original tenants had moved was pasted on the first floor. Everywhere Chen Ge turned, there was rubbish piling up either at the corner or directly on the floor.Chen Ge walked toward the building, and many questions floated up his mind. The pair lived in such a horrible environment, so this meant that their living conditions were too good. However, at the park, the woman readily pulled out 100 RMB just for the boy to visit the Haunted House. This went to show how much she cared for the boy. Yet, the boy was cruelly indifferent to her. He had said only two phrases while he was inside the Haunted House, and they were both directed at Chen Ge. The boy seemed to dislike the woman vehemently.Is it because of his mental issues, or is something more sinister at work?After walking up the stairs, Chen Ge realized there was only one tenant residing on the second floor. The corridor was swept clean, and there was laundry hanging on poles.\u201cIs anyone in?\u201d The door was open, but Chen Ge still knocked on the door out of courtesy.\u201cComing.\u201dFootsteps could be heard coming from inside the room. When she saw Chen Ge, she was visibly stunned.\u201cWhy are you here? Did we cause some damage when we visited the Haunted House?\u201d the woman asked cautiously.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. I\u2019m just interested in the little boy\u2019s situation, and I have something to ask him.\u201d Chen Ge realized the woman did not show any sign of wanting him inside the house so he continued. \u201cI have some friends at Jiujiang Medical University, and I thought, maybe they can help.\u201d\u201cThank you, but it\u2019s alright.\u201d The woman rejected him without thought. Then again, Chen Ge also felt like he was being a little too forward. \u201cI am really not a bad person. You can look on your phone for today\u2019s Jiujiang Morning News.\u201dSince the woman did not move, Chen Ge took out his own phone to look for an article on him helping to solve the Ping An Apartment case.\u201cLook, I\u2019ve once helped the police solve a buried case and was awarded a medal of honor.\u201d Chen Ge passed the phone to the woman, and she took a glance at it. \u201cSupernatural Livestreamer trapped and was finally saved by the police? The intrepidness of a Haunted House operator almost caused his death?\u201d\u201cIgnore the headlines. There should be my picture inside the article.\u201dChen Ge explained for a long time before the woman put her suspicion aside. She returned his phone to him and said, \u201cCome in for a seat then, just leave the door open.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThe woman led Chen Ge to the \u2018living room\u2019, which was more like a thirty square feet space that had a dining table and beds pushed to the corners.\u201cForgive the mess, I wasn\u2019t expecting any visitors. Would you like to have something to drink?\u201d The woman was embarrassed. In that moment, Chen Ge could see the boy\u2019s shadow on her.\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary. I just want to ask some questions about the boy\u2019s parents.\u201d Chen Ge took out his phone to record anything he deemed important.\u201cIt has been so long already, why are you asking that now?\u201d Regardless, the woman sat down across from Chen Ge and told him everything that had happened at Mu Yang High School three years ago.Three years ago, Mu Yang High School had still been a normal school. That summer day, it had poured down with rain. When the boy\u2019s parents returned home, the boy had been nowhere to be found. They had gone out to search for him, but in the end, it was the boy who had returned and not them.This sounds like the reason for the parents\u2019 disappearance is also because of the boy\u2026\u00a0Chen Ge recorded the key points that was given by the woman on his phone. He tried his best to recreate the event.Fan Yu\u2019s parents had realized that their child was missing after they came home after work. When they went out to look for him in the pouring rain, the last place they had been seen was unknown, but their bodies were most likely trapped under the water well at Mu Yang High School, and the boy was probably the sole witness of the whole event.It was also probably because he had witnessed the whole process that Fan Yu had become like this.Chen Ge looked at the surface of the table and frowned. He pulled out the black phone to look for the details of the side missions for School of Afterlife. The description for Side Mission 6, Deep Well, was \u2018One brother and one sister went to school, but how come no one returned?\u2019The black phone would not make a mistake, so what did the pair of siblings have to do with Fan Yu\u2019s parents? According to the hint on the black phone, it was the siblings who fell into the well and not the boy\u2019s parents. Why was that?Chen Ge put the black phone away and looked at the woman with tears in her eyes. He asked with uncertainty, \u201cIs Fan Yu an only child? Does he have brothers or sisters?\u201dThe moment the question left his lips, the woman\u2019s expression changed. Her nails scratched deep into her skin, and her tears fell freely. \u201cIf the accident did not happen to my two children, then Xiao Yu would have had a brother and a sister to play with.\u201d\u201cYour children?\u201d Before Chen Ge entered the room, he had noticed that the clothes hanging on the rods outside were mostly women\u2019s and children\u2019s, so he had assumed the woman was not married.\u201cThey died when they were still very young, mere toddlers.\u201d The woman was on the verge of a breakdown. She blurted a quick sorry before escaping into the kitchen to collect herself.Then, Fan Yu does have a brother and sister, but according to the woman\u2019s description, they passed away a long time ago. Why would the black phone say the pair of siblings did not return home after school? Why would toddlers attend school? Is the black phone mistaken, or is the woman lying? Or was Fan Yu hallucinating?The woman stayed inside the kitchen for a long time. Chen Ge stood up and headed toward the only other room in the house. Fan Yu should be inside; he was the focal point of this whole mystery.Chen Ge pushed open the door, and the bedroom he stepped into was very clean. Fan Yu was standing before the table, seemingly writing something. Chen Ge walked up to the boy and looked over his shoulder. He realized the boy was drawing, and he had a preference for black and red colors.\u201cXiao Yu, what are you drawing?\u201d Afraid that he might spook the boy, Chen Ge spoke in a soft voice. The boy turned to look at Chen Ge but did not answer. He turned back to focus on his drawing.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs he continued to add colors, the picture on the paper started to materialize.In a pure black house stood several red miniature humans.After finishing the drawing, the boy crumpled the paper up and threw it onto the floor before starting a new drawing.Chen Ge stood and watched for a long time. He realized the central theme of Fan Yu\u2019s drawings comprised of only these two things\u2014A black house and small, red humans.What is he trying to convey?\u00a0Chen Ge picked up the finished drawing from the floor and flattened it out. After studying it for some time, he silently slid it inside his pocket.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It is the direct contrast to black so pairing them together creates a unique optical effect.The black house was dark as night while the red humans were fresh as blood. The picture created a great pressure on those who viewed it.\u201cThe boy\u2019s favorite pastime is drawing. He doesn\u2019t like to go out and often secludes himself in his room.\u201d Unbeknownst to Chen Ge, the woman had entered the room. She held two glasses of water in her hands. \u201cNow, I no longer wish for anything but for him to grow up happily like a normal boy.\u201dThe woman passed a glass of water to Chen Ge while placing the other beside the boy. \u201cLet\u2019s go outside, he is afraid of contact with strangers.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Chen Ge returned to the living room, holding the glass of water. The woman sat down across from him.\u201cDo you have any other questions?\u201d The woman seemed to have put her guard up again.\u201cThe poor child, I believe that he was traumatized when he was young, so to cure his condition, we have to find out the reason why and then work from there.\u201d Chen Ge vocalized his inner thoughts. \u201cYou are his only family, and it is obvious that you care about him, do you mind if I ask you a few more questions?\u201dThe woman nodded. She had a thin sheen of sweat on her forehead, probably due to the heat.\u201cEarlier, you mentioned that Fan Yu\u2019s parents went missing after going out in search of him, so where was Fan Yu ultimately found?\u201d\u201cAt Mu Yang High School. He was hiding in my brother\u2019s office.\u201d\u201cMu Yang High School again? Weird things seem to keep on happening at that place.\u201d\u201cYou couldn\u2019t be more right\u2026\u201d The woman sighed. \u201cMu Yang High School is the worst school in Jiujiang. To be honest, I don\u2019t even understand the purpose of its existence. Before it was shut down, the police had to visit it every other day on account of the constant fighting.\u201d\u201cThat serious?\u201d Chen Ge listened closely. After all, getting the information from the woman was much more convenient than researching online.\u201cThat\u2019s not all.\u201d The woman stood up and continued in a serious tone. \u201cThe school is famously haunted. According to the nearby elders, the place was originally a crematorium. It was knocked down due to city planning, but just think about it, how peaceful could the school be, being built on top of a site like that? I advised my brother not to seek employment there, but he just refused to listen to me.\u201d\u201cThen why did your brother insist on going to teach at Mu Yang High School?\u201d\u201cThe salary was high, and he had a record, so it was difficult for him to find a job. Who would have thought that would be his last job?\u201d\u201cA record? Did he make some enemies? Could his disappearance be related to that?\u201d Chen Ge latched onto the details in the woman\u2019s conversation.\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing like that. My brother liked to drink, but he was a horrible drinker. That was why he was fired from his original school, and a bad history was left on his record. There were only so many schools in Jiujiang, and that made it difficult for him to get a new job.\u201d\u201cThen, his disappearance doesn\u2019t sound like it was caused by revenge.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not.\u201dThe woman\u2019s confidence made Chen Ge narrow his eyes. \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201dThe woman hesitated before she pulled out a picture from the drawer to place it on the table. \u201cEver since the initial opening of the school, there was a classroom that had always stayed locked, and entry was forbidden for all staff and students. Other than the headmaster, nobody knew why. After the old headmaster passed away, this became a mystery. There are still many legends surrounding that classroom. People said it was a reserved classroom for the spirits who had perished in the crematorium, or some tragedy had befallen the workers before the school was completed. In any case, it is a very dark place.\u201d\u201cWhat does that have to do with your brother\u2019s disappearance?\u201d Chen Ge was confused.\u201cTake a look at this, and you will understand why.\u201dChen Ge accepted the photo from the woman, and it was a very curious group photo. A drunken man sat in the middle, and around him stood several rows of students.It did sound like a normal graduation photo, but the problem lay in the fact that all the students were turned away from the camera!And should one look closer, every student was standing in a curious manner\u2014they were all on their tiptoes.\u201cWhere did you find this picture, and have you showed it to the police?\u201d Chen Ge placed the photo back on the table and rubbed the sweat that covered his palms.\u201cThe night before his disappearance, my brother was at the bar watching the ball game with his friends. To ensure he would be able to attend work the next morning, he decided to sleep in the nurse\u2019s office. When he passed one of the classrooms, he saw many people standing inside. Praising the class for their hardworking attitude, he stopped for a moment in front of the classroom\u2019s door. The people inside the class seemed to be in the middle of taking a class photo. When they saw him, they invited him in to take the central seat. After taking the picture, the students left, and he himself was unclear who ultimately gave him this picture.\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was flat, but the story made Chen Ge\u2019s skin crawl.\u201cWhen my brother saw the picture, it gave him such a shock that he woke up from the alcohol instantly. It was then that he realized he was sitting inside the sealed classroom.\u201d The woman pushed the picture toward Chen Ge. \u201cHe only revealed this to me and sister-in-law. We all thought it would eventually blow away, but the next day, that unfortunate incident happened. Xiao Yu suddenly disappeared, and the both of them went searching for him, but it was them who ended up missing. Therefore, I believe their disappearance doesn\u2019t have anything to do with revenge but was related to that sealed classroom.\u201d\u201cWhat did the police say?\u201d Chen Ge pushed the photo back.\u201cThey did bring the photo back to Mu Yang High School to conduct an investigation. Even though the students in the picture were wearing Mu Yang High School\u2019s uniform, they could not be found at the school. They opened up the sealed classroom and took a close look. All they found were my brother\u2019s footprints, which confirmed that my brother was indeed once inside that room.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOkay, I understand.\u201d Chen Ge asked the woman a few more questions, most of which she had no answer for and for some she only provided a vague answer. After knowing he would not get any new information from the woman, Chen Ge stood up to leave.\u201cLeaving so soon? It\u2019s so hot outside, why don\u2019t you take a sip of the drink before you leave?\u201d\u201cThank you, but I\u2019m not thirsty.\u201d Chen Ge thanked the woman for her kindness before leaving the second floor.After the conversation with the woman, Chen Ge had a better understanding of Mu Yang High School.\u00a0There are four side missions at Mu Yang High School, and two of them are related to the little boy\u2019s family.He took out Fan Yu\u2019s drawing from his pocket to take another few looks. The contrast of black and red seemed to be telling him something.\u00a0Black house and red men. Could they be related to Mu Yang High School? Could this drawing refer to a building at Mu Yang High School?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Could this drawing be an actual representation of the crime scene that he witnessed?The house is black, meaning the time of the crime was at night, and the people inside the house are red\u2014they probably represent his parents, the victims. This is the most direct interpretation.Chen Ge tried looking at this painting from multiple angles. The boy had a hasty artistic style; all the human shapes looked the same and had no defining features. Chen Ge could not even tell their gender.Wait, the red humans probably aren\u2019t referring to his parents, there are way too many of them in the drawing.\u00a0Chen Ge tried counting the number of red people, but every time he ended up with a different number.\u00a0The drawing is too messy. What is the boy actually trying to communicate with it?In the room, Fan Yu kept on repeating the same drawing. They were all about a black house and many red people. However, every time he was done, he would crumble up the drawings and toss them away as if he was dissatisfied with them.Regardless, this painting is a crucial clue.\u00a0Chen Ge came up with nothing even after studying the painting for a long time. He pocketed the drawing and glanced at the building behind him. The door, which he had left ajar, was now shut.Both the aunt and the child are problematic in their own way. The question is\u2026 whose problem is bigger?\u00a0Chen Ge got on the bus after escaping the maze-like paths. He was worried about his upcoming mission. If the woman was not lying to him, the test he was about to face that night would be incredibly difficult.For the sake of safety, Chen Ge took out his phone to search for more information on Mu Yang High School online. He came up with quite a large amount of information, and most of it came from various school forums.Based on the timeline, the posters probably were once students at Mu Yang High School, and after the school closed down, they were forced to change school and took the legends of Mu Yang High School along with them.After a cursory glance, a few of them did capture Chen Ge\u2019s attention. About one year ago, five students snuck into Mu Yang High School on a dare. They used their phones to record their experience, but instead of videoing the event, they updated a thread every few minutes.The original thread had long since been removed, and Chen Ge was reading a shared post. According to rumors, they had entered the sealed classroom and started playing the game of Pen Spirit.The five had sat around a table to summon the Pen Spirit, but as the game went on, there had ultimately been seven people standing in the classroom. No one knew where the additional two had come from, and the five ran out of the school, crying and yelling all the way.Luckily, all five of them had survived the ordeal, but two of them seemed to have been traumatized from the incident. One of them had turned illogically violent while the other had acquired an irrational fear of daylight. Eventually, the two had moved out of Jiujiang.Chen Ge looked at some of the comments under the post. A poster pointed out that during the game, two additional persons appeared, and in the end, there were two students who were traumatized. The poster suspected that the two who escaped were already someone else, and the original two were still trapped inside that classroom.This speculation received many likes, but there were other opposing views as well. Some said all five had been possessed, but the two had stronger constitutions, and that was why they had acted weirdly.There was a pinned message from a teacher that banned further discussion on Mu Yang High School. Chen Ge scrolled through the thread and realized there was one that was hidden.Chen Ge opened it, and he was baffled by the content. The poster stated that his father\u2019s company had planned to purchase the land on which Mu Yang High School was located for a low price. Initially, everything was fine, but when the contract was almost ready, his father would have the same dream every night. Many students wearing Mu Yang High School\u2019s uniform would come to their house for classes.The weird thing was, when they woke up, there was evidence of forced entry into their house. His father was so scared that he fell ill before finally resigning. That was the end of the story.After reading all the posts, Chen Ge could not help but compare Mu Yang High School and Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy, since they were both schools, and he came to a weird discovery.There were many supernatural rumors about Mu Yang High School online, but none of the stories mentioned death or injury. In comparison, while there was not much information on Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy online, the record at the police station showed that there was more than one death that had happened at the school.If I really think about it, Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy does sound scarier.\u00a0That was the only way Chen Ge could have made himself feel better.Sitting on the bus and looking out the window, Chen Ge\u2019s phone suddenly rang. He looked down and saw it was from He San.The kid sensed the possible unlocking of a new scenario, so he called to book in advance?\u00a0Chen Ge answered the call and placed his phone beside his ear. \u201cHello?\u201d\u201cBoss, quickly get on the video-sharing app, someone is coming for your bread and butter!\u201d\u201cHuh? There\u2019s someone who is opening a new Haunted House?\u201d Chen Ge clicked open the app, and before he was allowed entry into the homepage, an ad appeared on his phone\u2014\u2019Host, Qin Guang leads you to explore an actual haunted house!\u2019Chen Ge clicked on the screen and more details popped up.Qin Guang was a famous livestream host on the platform. He had more than 600,000 followers, and most of his short videos had a humorous theme. On his personal bio, it stated that he belonged to XX Studio, and that studio was the same one who had tried to cozy up to Chen Ge earlier when he was at Ping An Apartments.The ad explained that Qin Guang\u2019s latest adventure was to branch into a new livestreaming territory, to host a mystery livestream inside an actual haunted house.Chen Ge did not think too much of it at first, but when he saw Qin Guang\u2019s first mystery location, he was speechless. Qin Guang\u2019s team was going to livestream at Western Jiujiang\u2019s Ping An Apartments.\u201cBoss, have you seen it? That man realized that you had more than ten thousand views on your first livestream, so he\u2019s trying to copy your formula!\u201d He San grumbled indignantly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry, certain things cannot be copied.\u201dChen Ge had thought He San was going to bring him some big news, so he was rather disappointed. He was not that worried about Qin Guang, although he also knew Qin Guang would not see him as competition either.On the other end of the phone, He San said urgently, \u201cHe has so many followers. After he consolidates himself as a supernatural host, I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll turn around and claim that it was you who copied them!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. By the way, are you familiar with child psychology? I have a few questions for you.\u201d\u201cBoss, what time is it, you still have the luxury to ask questions like that? Furthermore, I\u2019m a forensic doctor. For questions of psychology, you should refer to psychologist or psychiatrist!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He looked about eight or nine, doesn\u2019t like to speak, and the darker the place, the more excited he gets, what kind of symptom are these?\u201d Chen Ge voiced the problem directly. He only had two people he could ask; one was He San, and the other was He Feng.\u201cForensic students focus on practical medicine, biology, and some chemistry. Psychology focuses on mental phenomena, neuroscience, and psychiatry. They are completely different fields. Even if you ask me, I won\u2019t be able to provide you with an answer.\u201d He San sighed helplessly. \u201cBoss, are you really not planning to do anything about this? I notice you have not updated for a few days already, and your previous livestream was days ago. If you allow this to continue, your popularity will start to fall. Look at your profile page, there are already comments that say you\u2019re running out of ideas, and they even started to mock your Haunted House.\u201d\u201cMock my Haunted House? There\u2019s such a thing?\u201d This did make Chen Ge worry. He clicked into his personal page and realized there were indeed plenty of negative comments.\u201cBoss, there are currently too many short videos, and homogenization is a serious problem. Once you stop updating, the viewers will quickly move onto other uploaders.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, but things aren\u2019t as serious as you think,\u201d Chen Ge replied. His focus was still on Fan Yu and his aunt. He had always treated the livestream and videos as additional support; the most important thing was still the missions on the black phone.\u201cIf you say so. I just wanted to remind you.\u201d There was a saddened trace to He San\u2019s voice. \u201cThat Qin Guang is an established host, and on top of that, he has great support from his studio. The platform will definitely provide him with plenty of promotion, but I still believe your livestream will be better than his.\u201d\u201cHis content is an imitation of mine,\u201d Chen Ge replied with a smile. The biggest difference between his content and other hosts\u2019 was that his was completely authentic and could not be copied. \u201cYes, I am widely lagging behind in terms of resources, channels, and fans, but if we\u2019re talking about the understanding and handling of the fear factor, he is still a rookie.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right! After all, you\u2019re a professional.\u201d He San paused before adding, \u201cBoss, I suddenly remembered something.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cDo you still remember the senior of mine that you scared until she cried?\u201d\u201cYour description fits so many people\u2014you might as well give me the name directly.\u201d\u201cGao Ru Xue. Her father is a psychologist and a tenured lecturer in criminal psychology. I\u2019ll ask if she can help you tonight.\u201d\u201cOkay, if you succeed, I\u2019ll treat you to a meal and gift you a free tour of the Haunted House\u2019s new scenario.\u201d Chen Ge appreciated the aid of this honest young man and easily promised a reward.\u201cThanks, but no thanks! Last time I visited your Haunted House, it caused me to have nightmares for a few consecutive nights,\u201d He San complained. \u201cThis one time, I fell asleep in class, and I didn\u2019t even know the lecturer had wandered to my side. In my dream, I was chased by a crazed doctor holding a hammer. When I ran to the top of the stairs, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I was so shocked that my body just reacted with an elbow jab, and when I opened my eyes, the lecturer\u2019s glasses were broken already\u2026\u201dChen Ge tried to hold in his laughter, but he failed. \u201cAlright then. I won\u2019t force you to visit the Haunted House in the future.\u201dAfter chatting for a bit more, Chen Ge finally hung up. He looked out the window, and the sun was slowly covered up by rain clouds. When he returned to New Century Park, from afar, Chen Ge saw a group of people crowding the entrance of the Haunted House. Xu Wan was busy negotiating with them.\u201cXiao Wan, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re finally back. These visitors are all here to visit the Haunted House, but since I could not find you, I could only ask for their patience.\u201d Xu Wan was already out of her make-up, and her forehead was filled with sweat from the anxiety.\u201cWell done. Stay outside to sell them the tickets, leave the rest to me.\u201d Chen Ge pushed open the gate, put on the Doctor Skull-cracker outfit, and entered the Murder by Midnight scenario.At around 4 pm, it started to drizzle, and the clouds in the sky thickened. Many of the park attractions had to stop for fear of accidents, and most visitors who still had not had their fill went to the indoor attractions. It was thus that Chen Ge\u2019s Haunted House became an unlikely favorite. The crowd outside the place was huge until 5 pm, when it started to disperse.Chen Ge, who had run around the building for the whole afternoon, was exhausted. He removed his outfit and walked out of the Haunted House.The sky was dark, and the wind was howling.It was also pouring several years ago when Fan Yu\u2019s parents disappeared.\u00a0Chen Ge looked at the sky with a complicated emotion. He told Xu Wan to go home before returning to the maintenance room to prepare his backpack.He shoved a lighter, flashlight, multi-purpose mallet, and doll into it and left the Haunted House in a raincoat. Due to the unexpected crowd, when Chen Ge left the park, it was already 6 pm. He stopped a cab at the entrance, but when he told the driver his destination was Mu Yang High School, the driver refused to take him.He had no choice but to wait for another. The other driver told Chen Ge that the roads leading to Mu Yang High School were already overgrown with shrubs and were unpassable by car, so he could only drop Chen Ge near Mu Yang High School.There was a time limit on the mission. Arriving early meant more time to scout and consequently lower the risk. Chen Ge did not want to waste time. After negotiating the price with the driver, he departed.On the way there, he asked the driver for more information on Mu Yang High School, but the driver merely looked ahead with a serious expression and focused fully on his driving. In that moment, Chen Ge found himself missing the talkative uncle who had driven him to Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy.At around 7 pm, they finally reached the destination. The road was horrible, and the place was even more backwards than the countryside.\u201cThe car cannot continue any further, so this is where I\u2019ll have to stop.\u201d The driver pointed outside the window. \u201cThere should be people living nearby, so go to them if you\u2019re lost. Send me the fare through WeChat; I don\u2019t accept cash.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNo cash?\u201d Chen Ge was confused, but he did not ask further; everyone had their quirks. After paying, he got out from the taxi.The rain started to intensify, and the sky by then was completely dark. Chen Ge looked around him, and there were indeed several rows of houses a distance away, but they looked abandoned because they were completely dark.\u201cHow am I supposed to find Mu Yang High School?\u201dChen Ge turned to ask the driver, only to see the driver toss the seat mat he had sat on earlier out the window and turn around to leave without hesitation.He refused to take my cash and tossed out the mat I sat on earlier\u2026 what is the meaning of this? Is it because he thinks I\u2019m dirty?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Taxi drivers were the party that were the most familiar with the city; thus, they knew the taboo places that populated the city.Has the driver misunderstood me?The mat was dropped in the mud and was soon drenched by the rain. While he was reading the supernatural stories on Mu Yang High School, Chen Ge did not think they were that scary. However, after the incident with the taxi driver, Chen Ge\u2019s bravery started to waver.The requirement of this mission is merely for me to survive. This means that even the black phone believes that surviving will be a huge challenge.In the blink of an eye, the taxi disappeared down the road. Chen Ge stood in his raincoat surrounded by a wide expanse of nothing but trees. It felt like he was abandoned in the wild.The rain continued to pour. Chen Ge pulled the raincoat tighter and pulled out his flashlight to wander down the muddy road. The rainclouds were low in the sky, blocking out the moonlight. Chen Ge moved toward the buildings that he had seen earlier, and it was not until then that he realized how rundown they actually were.Rusted chains hung off the door, and the glass on the window had long since been broken. Looking through the cracks, Chen Ge saw that the interior was stuffed with rotten furniture and trash with unknown bugs crawling over the ground.There\u2019s not a single sign of a living person, is this place that cursed?Before he came, he did obtain several precious nuggets of information from Fan Yu\u2019s aunt. Therefore, Chen Ge knew a thing or two about the surroundings of Mu Yang High School. Since there was no one for him to ask, he could only wander deeper into the unknown based on his memory.The road was muddy from the rain, and it was bordered on both sides by weirdly-shaped trees, but they had all overgrown into the road due to a lack of trimming.Mu Yang High School\u2019s site was once a crematorium. As scary as that is, it meant that there had to be a road for vehicles. However, the road keeps getting smaller and smaller; it\u2019s practically impossible for any four-wheeled vehicle to traverse. Am I even on the right road?\u00a0The intensity of the rain slowed Chen Ge\u2019s progress.\u00a0It\u2019ll not bode well if I get lost. If Mu Yang High School is not at the end of this road, I\u2019ll need to turn back and abandon this quest.Chen Ge continued on the road at another thirty minutes. At the end of the road, he saw a sign that was knocked off the ground and a wooden fence.There\u2019s lichen growing on its side\u2014it has been on the ground for years already.Chen Ge pulled the sign upright, but the characters were too faded for him to make any sense of it. He used his flashlight to scan the sign.\u00a0Why does the lichen only grow on one side? Is it because of the sun, or has someone been here recently to move the sign and the fence?He stopped moving and looked at the time on his phone.\u00a0It\u2019s almost 8 pm, and the mission location is still nowhere to be found. The only good news is that I still have coverage. At least I can call for help in case of an emergency.The night was exceptionally dark because of the rain. Chen Ge\u2019s phone was the sole source of light for miles.\u00a0Both sign and fence are here, but weirdly enough, they seem like they have recently been moved. This is curious.Chen Ge used the sign to part the shrubbery that blocked his way. He walked for another ten meters before the scenery changed. A row of broken wooden railings stood in the middle of the forest, and within the railings were several squat buildings.This is Mu Yang High School?Compared to Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy, this school looked far more dilapidated. Its size was less than one-third of Western Jiujiang\u2019s Private Academy.Chen Ge did not let his guard down simply because the place was smaller in size. The school being smaller might not necessarily be a good thing. Yes, the need for exploration had decreased but so had the space for hiding.Chen Ge tossed the sign aside and jumped over the rail into Mu Yang High School. All the buildings of the school could be captured with one glance.The one closest to the entrance was the education block. It seemed to have been the victim of a huge fire. The surface was charred black, and the corners of the wall seemed cracked, as if it could fall at any given moment.To the left side of the education block was the dormitory. Probably due to the low number of students, the dormitory only had two stories and barely a handful of rooms. To the right was the office, and from the exterior, the building seemed to be the best preserved.Behind the education block was an uneven field. Two basketball courts and several ping pong tables stood to the side.Thus was the layout for Mu Yang High School. Other than its rich supernatural history, the school itself was lacking in flavor and personality. Chen Ge suspected that the real reason for closure was not something supernatural but rather there were simply no new students who wished to study here.Weirdly enough, when Chen Ge arrived at his destination, he felt calmer. He was an expert at managing his emotions.There are four side missions at Mu Yang High School: The Pen Spirit, The Fifth Cubicle in the Toilet, Deep Well, and The Sealed Classroom. If I want to unlock the full scenario, I mustn\u2019t miss out on any of them.In the previous mission, it was because Chen Ge had a more than ninety percent completion rate that he obtained the hidden reward\u2014Wang Qi\u2019s Missing Person Notice. It was this item that had bridged the relationship between Chen Ge and Xiaoxiao\u2019s family.He understood the importance of having a high mission completion rate, but it was easier said than done. Any one of the side missions could rival the creepiness of a Nightmare Mission, and he was expected to complete all four in one night.It is still not yet midnight. There\u2019s still time before the active hour for the residents of the other world. I should scout out these four locations. If the difficulty is too high, I still have time to leave.Chen Ge put the doll in his chest, whipped out his trusty mallet, and headed toward the education block.The surface of the building was black with soot that remained even after so many years.The whole building is burnt, could this be related to the original crematorium?Chen Ge moved lightly. He remembered the mission description provided by the black phone.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThere\u2019s a classroom at the end of the corridor that\u2019s always sealed. No one ever enters it, but every night, the classroom will come alive with activity.\u201dBad luck befell Fan Yu\u2019s father after he entered that classroom, so that classroom might be the center of the paranormal activities at Mu Yang High School.The creepy photo appeared in Chen Ge\u2019s mind. There was a high chance he would have to spend the night with the roomful of students who refused to meet the camera.All the classrooms were locked, and Chen Ge could only peer in through the windows with his flashlight. The front few classrooms were normal abandoned classrooms. It was not until Chen Ge reached the very last classroom at the end of corridor that he spotted something weird.The classroom was curiously preserved from the fire. However, what attracted Chen Ge\u2019s attention the most were the books, paper, and pen that were placed on the table in the middle of the classroom, creating the illusion that someone had just attended a class there.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Holding the mallet in his hand, he wished desperate to knock the door down to see what was written on the piece of paper.According to the school forum, five students once broke into Mu Yang High School to play a game of Pen Spirit in the last classroom on a dare. Could the pen and paper have been left behind by them?\u00a0Chen Ge thought about it and realized that was impossible. According to the post\u2019s description, when the two extra people appeared in the room, the five students were so scared that they escaped as fast as they could. In their desperation to escape, they had to knock over some of the furniture, but all the tables and chairs in the room now were neatly arranged.Of course, that doesn\u2019t take away from the possibility that after they left, the furniture was rearranged or the speculation that all five were possessed.Chen Ge put his mallet down and decided to save the classroom for last. After leaving the education block, Chen Ge headed for the dormitory.The dilapidated squat building had less than a handful of rooms, and he walked around it for a long time before coming across a faded iron sign. The characters on it were smudged, but Chen Ge believed that it once read \u2018Second Floor is Female Rooms. No Entry to Males.\u2019This school sure is shabby.After removing his raincoat, Chen Ge dabbed at the rain that had seeped into his collar and was about to carry on when his phone rang. He looked at the caller ID and answered it readily. \u201cHe San?\u201d\u201cBoss, I\u2019ve given my senior your phone number. She said that she would have her father contact you when he\u2019s home.\u201d\u201cThank you, is there anything else?\u201d\u201cAlso, that Qin Guang has just started his livestream. Are you sure you\u2019re not going to take a look? He hired an actor to play the killer next door, and his opening and even his analysis were a complete copy of yours. I didn\u2019t even know from where I should start to complain.\u201d\u201cLet him be then. But when I start my livestream in a bit, remember to come support me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re starting a livestream\u203d\u201d He San\u2019s voice shot up several octaves. Chen Ge was gladdened that he had such a loyal viewer. \u201cSince it has been quite long since my previous livestream, I have something exciting planned this time.\u201dThere was silence on the other end of the phone. Chen Ge could hear shuffling footsteps several seconds later. He San seemed to have put on his slippers to run around his bedroom to shake every one of his roommates awake. \u201cIt\u2019s time to get up to watch the livestream! Yet another bout with death tonight!\u201dWhile Chen Ge was thankful for He San\u2019s free promotion, but his words did make him feel a bit weirded out.After hanging up, Chen Ge opened up the video-sharing app. Qin Guang\u2019s supernatural livestream was heavily promoted on the front page. He clicked on it for a quick look. It was obvious that a full team was behind this production. There was a professional cameraman, and Qin Guang was only responsible for the analysis and looking for clues. Just the comparison of video quality alone could squish Chen Ge like a bug. He definitely could not fault his opponent for having better preparation.680,000 views. If I had that many views to promote my Haunted House, wouldn\u2019t the whole park be filled the next day?Livestreams and short videos were Chen Ge\u2019s only way of advertisement, and Qin Guang\u2019s featured livestream did point a way for Chen Ge. If he could reach Qin Guang\u2019s level of popularity, then perhaps one day the platform would be willing to use so many resources to support him.Chen Ge, don\u2019t get too far ahead of yourself for now. Focus on the current goal of surviving tonight first.He left Qin Guang\u2019s livestream and opened his own. He was stranded at the countryside, so his connection was weak. His livestream video was fuzzy, and there were constant black screens and lag. He could not even see the chat.My video quality might not be as good as Qin Guang\u2019s, but my content is definitely better than his\u2026Since he couldn\u2019t see the chat, Chen Ge could not communicate with his viewers. After a brief introduction of Mu Yang High School, he stopped following the livestream. Chen Ge searched through the first floor of the dormitory and came up with nothing, so he moved to the second floor.\u201cThe female dormitory room looks similar to the males\u2019.\u201dThe rooms were filled with textbooks and trash. When the school was closed, most of the stuff inside it was not cleared out. Chen Ge looked through the rooms patiently with his flashlight. When he passed through the fourth bedroom on the second floor, he discovered that there were four chairs placed neatly in a row inside the room, and several pieces of white paper as well as a ballpoint pen were placed on one of the chairs.\u201cThe paper and pen look brand new, so they must have been placed inside the room after the school was closed.\u201dThis was the second time that Chen Ge had come across the combination of paper and pen. The rusted lock was a mere decoration. Chen Ge merely rattled it several times before it fell away.As the door opened, the smell of mold hit him like a wave. Chen Ge covered his mouth and nose as he walked closer to the chair to look at the pieces of paper.There were four white papers in total, the first one read\u2014\u2019When will I die?\u2019The second read\u2014\u2019How will I die?\u2019The third read\u2014\u2019Who will be the next to die?\u2019The fourth was completely empty.The Pen Spirit game?Chen Ge ransacked the rest of the room to try to come up with some extra info, but most of the stuff had decayed from time.Since his investigation turned up nothing, Chen Ge turned his focus back on the white paper in the middle of the room.\u00a0No one could provide an actual explanation behind the Pen Spirit game, but the scientific community stresses that it was reasons like breathing, heartbeat, and blood flow that caused the human body to shiver. A simple human without special training would have their arm move after maintaining them in a constant, elevated position for a long time. This is a natural bodily reaction that has nothing to do with legends of the Pen Spirit.Chen Ge placed the phone on the bed and made sure himself and the four chairs were all within view.Since I need to complete all four side missions at Mu Yang High School, might as well start with this one.He turned to close the bedroom door. He stood and hesitated for four minutes before sitting down and picking up the ballpoint pen.Internally, he told himself not to worry. Chen Ge placed the doll in his chest pocket, and with his right hand holding the pen and left hand holding the mallet, he started the game of Pen Spirit.He tried to remember as many details from the thread that he had read earlier. He raised his arm slightly and straightened the pen so that the tip of the pen touched the white paper. He closed his eyes and started to chant.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cPen Spirit, Pen Spirit, you are my spirit from my previous life, and I am your spirit in this life. If you are with us, please draw a circle on the paper.\u201dAfter chanting, Chen Ge tried to make himself calm down. His arm was suspended over the paper, his body frozen.The rain outside the window continued to fall. The school that was swallowed by the night started to shift imperceptibly.The moldy smell in the room dispersed, and a cold draft of an unknown origin lifted the white paper on the chair slightly. Not long after that, Chen Ge\u2019s eyes flew open. He had just felt someone grip his hand.Chen Ge stared closely at his right hand while his left hand tightened over the mallet. He would strike the moment things went wrong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The bedsheet that was beyond the light of the flashlight fluttered lightly like something was crawling out from underneath it. Rain droplets fell on the window. A storm was brewing outside, but inside the dormitory room, it was eerily quiet.With his arm hanging over the white paper, Chen Ge tried to make himself relax. After chanting the spell to invoke the Pen Spirit, there was an obvious pressure on the back of his palm like someone had placed their hand over his. Chen Ge could even feel the chills coming from the other person\u2019s fingertips.\u201cPen Spirit, Pen Spirit, you are my spirit from my previous life, and I am your spirit in this life. If you are with us, please draw a circle on the paper.\u201dChen Ge chanted again, and the feeling of iciness on the back of his hand intensified. However, to his befuddlement, the pen in his grasp remained upright. It did not draw a circle or even do anything.The Pen Spirit refuses to answer my call?The atmosphere in the room turned palpable with pressure, and the chill from the back of his hand had now spread to his arm.For some reason, I feel like a few more individuals have joined me in this room.Chen Ge focused, and his pupils started to dilate in the dark. Probably due to the Yin Yang Vision, he could see three blurry shadows standing around him with their hands extended to grab the pen in Chen Ge\u2019s palm.Three of you?Chen Ge\u2019s heart skipped a beat, but with a blink, the image that he saw instantly disappeared. However, Chen Ge knew that it did not mean they had left. Chen Ge\u2019s palm felt like it had been stuck inside a cold-water bath. He was certain that there were at least three other hands holding the pen in his grasp.Three \u2018individuals\u2019 answered my call. Is this the effect of my \u2018Specter\u2019s Favored\u2019 title?While Chen Ge was trying to figure out an answer, the pen that hovered over the paper suddenly moved. It was slight, but Chen Ge definitely felt it.Is it beginning?The flashlight he placed to his side seemed to have dimmed, and under Chen Ge\u2019s close scrutiny, the pen in his grasp started to move. The tip of the pen attached itself to the surface of the paper, and with the friction between the paper and the pen, soon a red circle was drawn.Chen Ge knew he did not move, but there was indeed a drawing on the paper. Chen Ge stared at the circle, and he was reminded of this side mission\u2019s name\u2014The Pen Spirit Who Refused to Leave.There are three taboos to the Pen Spirit game. One, you mustn\u2019t ask about your cause of death; two, you mustn\u2019t ask about your life expectancy; three, you have to unbind the spirit when you\u2019re done. Violating any one of these will lead to horrible consequences.The third was the most serious because if the spirit was not unbound, it would stay by the person who had invoked it forever until it turned malevolent and killed all the players.\u201cHopefully, there is no accident,\u201d Chen Ge murmured before shifting his focus back onto the white paper. The red circle was drawn right in the middle of the paper.Sounds like it has heard my voice. It\u2019s time for me to ask some questions.Chen Ge was only there to complete the black phone\u2019s mission. He did not want to try anything stupid lest he angered the spirit.It is rare to have summoned the Pen Spirit.\u00a0Chen Ge thought about it and voiced the question that he most wished to know the answer to. \u201cPen Spirit, Pen Spirit, do you know where my parents are?\u201dWhen he did the bathtub Nightmare Mission, the people Chen Ge wanted to meet the most were his parents, but his wish had not been fulfilled. However, this did tell him that at least his parents were still alive. They were merely missing.Chen Ge did want to know the answer to this question. However, to his surprise, when he posed this question, the pen in his grasp started to quiver, and there was even a faded crack that appeared on the body of the pen.This was different to what he expected.\u00a0Is my question that difficult?Two minutes later, Chen Ge had an uncanny feeling that the room had turned brighter. The pen in his hand started to move again to draw another circle.What does that mean? Pass?\u00a0Chen Ge looked at the two circles on the paper, and he could sense the Pen Spirit\u2019s awkwardness. It did not know the answer to his question either.This is weird, but it does sound like my parents\u2019 disappearance is more complicated than it appears.\u00a0Chen Ge was silent for a long time. Other than this question, he really did not have anything that he was that curious about.\u00a0So be it, I\u2019ll just ask a random question just to get this side mission over with.The chill on his arm had spread to his shoulder. As the game continued, Chen Ge could feel about half of his body starting to get numb like it was slowly escaping his control.\u201cThen I shall switch to a different question. Pen Spirit, Pen Spirit, can you please tell me who my future wife will be?\u201dThe pen quivered, and the flashlight flickered as if announcing the arrival of something. The atmosphere in the room started to get nervous again. The window rattled on its hinges, and droplets of rain seeped into the room. Lightning flashed across the sky, and in that split second, there were four shadows that were reflected on the wall.Chen Ge felt his hand weaken as the pen in it started to move. Blood red letters appeared on the white paper, and soon, the first character was finished.\u201cXu? Is it Xu Wan?\u201d Despite it supposedly being a throwaway question, Chen Ge\u2019s interest was piqued. The pen in his hand continued moving, but as it was starting to begin the second character, it suddenly stopped moving.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dChen Ge was a spectator in this whole enterprise. He did not exert any force, but the pen in his grasp began to quiver violently, and more cracks started to form on its surface.BANG!Many forces seemed to be fighting within the darkened bedroom. The ballpoint pen finally crumbled under pressure and cracked. One of the forces seemed to have surrendered. Then Chen Ge saw something shocking.The pen in his grasp crossed out the \u201cXu\u201d that was already written and wrote down another name beside it!\u201cZhang\u2026 Ya?\u201dThe name was so perfectly and clearly written on the white paper that Chen Ge did not even know how to respond. \u201cPen Spirit, are you sure this is the name that you intended to write from the very beginning?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere was no answer, and the chill on his arm also disappeared. \u201cPen Spirit, are you still with us? If you can hear me, please draw a circle.\u201dThe feeling of Yin energy had dissipated completely, and the room had returned to normal. It seemed like the Pen Spirit had left without saying goodbye. However, for the sake of security, Chen Ge chanted, \u201cPen Spirit, Pen Spirit, you are my spirit from my previous life, and I am your spirit in this life. If you wish to go, then please go ahead.\u201dChen Ge stood up from beside the chair since the game was already over. Once he relinquished his grasp, the ballpoint pen in his grasp split into several sections. The whole thing just looked sad.My game of Pen Spirit sure is different from others\u2019.Chen Ge picked up his phone and realized with a start that his livestream\u2019s popularity had surpassed 20,000 views\u2014this was a brand-new record for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At the beginning of the livestream, I remember seeing only ten people in the room.\u00a0Chen Ge raised the phone up to the ceiling, but the signal was still weak. The chat was lagging badly. One moment, he could not even load a single comment, but suddenly, he would be overwhelmed by a ton. He could barely make sense of anything.20,000 views but less than 5,000 followers, this ratio is a bit lacking.Chen Ge used his phone to snap pictures of the few pieces of paper that had been used in the Pen Spirit game. He then turned the camera to capture the broken ballpoint pen that sat in the middle of the chair. \u201cDear viewers, can you see this? I have played the Pen Spirit game until the pen itself committed suicide! Aren\u2019t you going to follow me? Do you know how much I\u2019m risking being here? An unknown host like myself, without equipment or a team. I\u2019m here all alone, threading the line of danger. I know my equipment is not that great, and I can\u2019t even interact with you in chat, but I can lead you into the most authentic supernatural experience. This is definitely one of a kind and cannot be copied.\u201dAfter giving his speech, the number of followers started to rise. For Chen Ge, he was merely completing the black phone\u2019s mission, but it was a different concern from the viewers\u2019 perspective. Especially in comparison to Qin Guang\u2019s livestream. Even though Chen Ge was lacking in terms of equipment, his content was inimitable, whether from the aspect of danger or spectacle.The key to a successful livestream was none other than freshness and creativity. Qin Guang\u2019s team relied on a finished script, and they even had an actor to play the part. However, no matter how realistic the actor\u2019s acting was, it would appear forced. However, Chen Ge\u2019s content was very different; even Chen Ge himself did not know what would happen next.\u201cThank you for your support. That was the Pen Spirit game, please do not try this at home. Alright, now we shall move onto the next location.\u201d Looking at the popularity that was still rising, Chen Ge was overjoyed. In any case, since he had to finish these missions dispensed by the black phone, why not make use of them fully and convert them into popularity?I wonder what is happening inside the chatroom, but a rising popularity is a good thing. At least my risk of coming here tonight is not going to waste.\u00a0The easy completion of the first side mission gave Chen Ge a boost of confidence. He put on his raincoat and left the dormitory. He had done everything he could there, so there was no point in staying.There are three side missions left: the Sealed Classroom, the Deep Well, and the Fifth Cubicle in the Toilet.The Fifth Cubicle in the Toilet appeared to be inside the education block. Chen Ge had been to the dormitory\u2019s toilets, and they only had four cubicles. If the office building\u2019s layout was similar to the dormitory\u2019s, then only the education block\u2019s toilets fit the mission description.Chen Ge glanced at his phone. He had arrived at Mu Yang High School at 8 pm. Technically, the Pen Spirit game should not have taken too long, but the time showed that it was now almost 9 pm.There are three hours left until midnight. One hour for each mission, should be fine.Chen Ge\u2019s plan was to finish all the side missions as soon as possible and find a corner to hide in until dawn arrived.When he stood before the education block again, Chen Ge had a weird feeling that the thing that sat before him was not an abandoned building but a giant coffin that housed plenty of dead bodies.The side mission did not specify the exact location of the toilet. There are three stories to this block, and this means that any one of the toilets on the three levels could be my mission location.\u00a0Chen Ge turned on his flashlight and entered the building.Passing through empty classrooms at night caused Chen Ge\u2019s skin to crawl. He was afraid that once he turned, he would see something that shouldn\u2019t exist inside the classroom. He rushed toward the end of the corridor and entered the first floor\u2019s toilet.The place was spared from the fire and the interior remained the same as it was several years ago. The flooring was cracked and weeds could be seen peeking through the cracks. There were a brownish stain on the wall and the sole window in the room was creaking eerily.\u201cFocus on the mission, there\u2019s no time to waste.\u201dAll of the toilets inside the education block had 6 cubicles. Years of abandonment meant that most of cubicle doors were broken and Chen Ge could look into the cubicles without even opening the door.With the mallet in his hand, Chen Ge walked past the six cubicles. The earlier four cubicles had nothing wrong about them but the fifth and sixth cubicles caught his attention. The doors to these two cubicles were shut and with a slight push, Chen Ge realized with a start that they were locked.Normally, the door is locked only because someone is occupying the cubicle.However, that could not be true here.\u00a0The school has been abandoned for three years already. Even if something is occupying the cubicles, it cannot be \u2018human\u2019. In any case, I\u2019d better take a closer look.Chen Ge smashed at the sixth door with his mallet, and the door fell open. Before Chen Ge could react, several dark shadows charged at him.\u201cWhat is that\u203d\u201d He jumped back to avoid them. He shone his flashlight at his \u2018assailant\u2019, and Chen Ge was embarrassed to realize it was merely the cleaning equipment. After recovering from the fake scare, Chen Ge picked the mops and brooms off the floor and shoved them back into the cubicle. He found the same thing in the next cubicle. All six of the cubicles on the first floor were normal, which meant that his mission venue was on another floor.After exiting the toilet, Chen Ge looked over with shoulder with uncertainty. The cubicle doors creaked on their hinges like people waving at him.This would create quite a scary effect inside the Haunted House.\u00a0Chen Ge made a mental note to remember this for the future and headed up the stairs to the second floor. It had the same layout as the first-floor toilet, but the window was boarded up. Once Chen Ge stepped into the space, he felt weirdly pressured.This should be the place then.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euProbably because the window was boarded up, the toilet was better preserved than the first floor one; there was not much change compared to how it was several years ago. He walked to the first cubicle, and before even pushing the door open, he heard footsteps coming from the corridor outside.However, due to the interruption from the rain, he could not really tell for sure.Is someone running in the corridor?He hid in a corner of the toilet and raised his mallet in a guarded posture in case someone decided to rush into the room. Nothing like that happened.As time moves toward midnight, the school is slowly starting to change, like it is coming alive. Looks like I will need to pick up my pace.\u00a0Chen Ge stopped hesitating and pushed open the first four cubicles in one go. When he stood before the fifth cubicle, the footsteps in the corridor started again, and he heard it clearly this time. There were two sets of footsteps.The mission description for the Fifth Cubicle in the Toilet stated that a red shadow would appear at midnight, was that it?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, what happened next was an unknown, leaving Chen Ge plenty of room to imagine.He switched off the flashlight and thought to himself,\u00a0The mission states that a red shadow will appear in the toilet at midnight, but the footsteps clearly show that there were two people walking side by side. Could it be that the red shadow has found a new friend in the years that it was trapped in this abandoned school?The footsteps were slowly approaching the second-floor toilet. Following the mission requirement, Chen Ge should hide inside the fifth cubicle, but Chen Ge felt that was too dangerous. He would have effectively trapped himself.Perhaps I should act more proactively.\u00a0Chen Ge hid behind the toilet door, and no matter who it was, he would start by whacking them on their head. Chen Ge took a deep breath before holding it in and raising the mallet above his head.The footsteps became clearer and clearer. It sounded like two individuals running side by side. They were dangerously close to the second-floor bathroom. The wait was real torture for Chen Ge. He had no idea what was outside and had even less of a clue what they were planning to do. All he could do was make himself as silent as possible.Several seconds later, the footsteps finally stopped before the toilet entrance.Here they come!Chen Ge\u2019s hand that gripped the mallet had started to sweat, and his heart was racing at an impossible rate. The storm continued to brew outside, and the rain seeped into the room, wetting the toilet floor.Where are they?\u00a0Chen Ge turned to look over his shoulder. There were no human faces staring down at him like he had expected. His patience was wearing thin. With one hand on the door knob, he prepared to lean out to take a look. However, before he could do that, a flash of lightning tore apart the sky, and utilizing the temporary brightness, Chen Ge saw two shadows reflected on the toilet floor.They\u2019re standing at the entrance!His body froze, and since his flashlight had already been switched off, he could see nothing in the darkness of the toilet.The shadows were short, like two children.He did not dare to let his guard down. After waiting for several seconds, the footsteps resumed. However, unlike what he had expected, the owners of the footstep did not enter the toilet but went down the staircase next to it and down to the first floor.Leaving just like that?\u00a0Chen Ge slowly moved out from behind the door. He turned to look at the entrance, and there was nothing there.The thing that stood at the door earlier felt like two children. This is different from the red shadow described by the black phone. Is this because too much time has passed since then, or did my early arrival at the school mess up the schedule?Chen Ge could not figure out the answer. Switching the flashlight back on, Chen Ge wandered over to the fifth cubicle. Regardless, he had to inspect the cubicle to see whether it was the actual mission venue. The door opened to reveal an old yet completely normal space.Based on the situation thus far, the mission venue should be in the third-floor toilet. The two children from earlier have run down to the first floor, so this is the perfect chance.\u00a0Chen Ge turned to walk out the toilet. Before he reached the threshold, his phone rang. It was an unknown caller.Whose number is this?\u00a0Chen Ge did not have many friends, and the few he had would not normally contact him. After a brief hesitation, Chen Ge retreated to the corner and exited the livestream to answer the phone. \u201cHello?\u201d\u201cAre you Ru Xue\u2019s classmate? I hear you came across a strange boy whom you suspect is suffering from a psychological problem?\u201d The voice on the other end of the phone had a gravity to it. It exuded an air of confidence.\u201cI did, and you are?\u201d\u201cI am Ru Xue\u2019s father.\u201d He San did mention giving Chen Ge\u2019s phone number to Gao Ru Xue earlier. Looks like this senior of his did things with efficiency.\u201cDo you mind telling me about the boy in greater detail? Psychological illness is not unlike a venom inside one\u2019s body. If one does not remove it as soon as possible, it might ruin that boy\u2019s future.\u201d Gao Ru Xue\u2019s father was familiar with the potential danger of psychological problems. From his perspective, a psychological illness could be more dangerous than many physical illnesses.\u201cThere is this boy about seven or eight. He\u2019s physically fine, but he appears to have withdrawn from the world; he refuses to interact with others and is afraid of sunlight.\u201d\u201cAre there any other symptoms? If possible, can you give me them in detail?\u201d\u201cI met this boy at the entrance of a Haunted House park attraction. His aunt told me that the boy likes to spend time inside Haunted Houses. Normal emotions that one should experience inside a Haunted House like fear and anxiety were missing from the boy. In fact, he appeared to be more comfortable in the darkness than under the sunlight. It gave me the impression that darkened corners give him a sense of security.\u201d Chen Ge voiced the speculation that he had. If he had not met the child in person, he would not have believed that such a curious boy existed.\u201cA boy of seven or eight who likes to visit Haunted Houses? And doesn\u2019t feel afraid?\u201d\u201cYes, the boy even showed interest in the actor who was in a dead person\u2019s make-up.\u201dThere was silence on the other end of the phone for a few seconds. \u201cIf it is just a lack of fear, it could be autism, which could be responsible for the damage to the amygdala of his brain.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think I understand.\u201d\u201cTo put it simply, the amygdala is the central nervous system where memory is processed and stored. It is also responsible for the production of emotions like rage and fear. If one\u2019s amygdala is damaged, even if facing a lion or viper, one wouldn\u2019t be afraid, much less being scared inside a Haunted House.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGao Ru Xue\u2019s father had a point, but Chen Ge still felt the description did not quite fit Fan Yu\u2019s conditions. \u201cDoctor Gao, it is by no means that the boy is not afraid of anything. For one, he is afraid of sunlight and hates walking under the sun. Also, he was not only unafraid of the Haunted House, he liked the environment inside it. It felt like he was a completely different boy inside and outside of the Haunted House.\u201dChen Ge thought about it before adding, \u201cHe was completely silent when he was outside the Haunted House and refused to have interaction with others, but he was energized when inside the Haunted House. When it was time to leave, his refusal to leave was vehement, and I saw him injure his aunt with my own eyes.\u201d\u201cListening to your description, it might also be a sign of bipolar disorder, highly destructive and irrational when angered but highly individualistic and retreats into his own world when depressed.\u201d Teacher Gao shared his analysis with Chen Ge. \u201cBut one point still eludes me. Patients with bipolar disorder might be triggered at any given moment, and there shouldn\u2019t be a clear trigger like being inside or outside a Haunted House. My personal opinion is that since the boy\u2019s attitude change is related to Haunted Houses, then the source of his problem should be related to a Haunted House as well. Did he suffer from any trauma inside a Haunted House when he was young? Or did his parents work at a Haunted House?\u201dAfter hearing the analysis from Gao Ru Xue\u2019s father, a speculation appeared in Chen Ge\u2019s mind.The boy\u2019s changes in personality happened inside his Haunted House, and the biggest difference his Haunted House had compared to others was that his Haunted House was really haunted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Lonelytree\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Millman97Fan Yu likes to visit Haunted Houses because he likes the company of ghosts?\u00a0Chen Ge came to this unlikely answer after listening to all of Teacher Gao\u2019s reasoning.\u201cI don\u2019t dare diagnose this patient so easily. If you have time, you can bring him to see me.\u201d Teacher Gao also had not come across such a patient before, and he wished to inspect him in person. \u201cPsychological illnesses are very complicated, and there are too many uncertainties to their causes. It could be related to the boy\u2019s living environment, personal trauma, or even genetic inheritance.\u201dChen Ge did not answer. When he came up with the conclusion that Fan Yu liked the company of ghosts, an extremely scary thought cropped up in his mind!He peeled open his raincoat to retrieve Fan Yu\u2019s drawing from inside his pocket. The black house and the red little humans.Before arriving at Mu Yang High School, Chen Ge had assumed that this referred to one of the buildings at the school, but none of the building there fitted Fan Yu\u2019s drawing. If anything, the squat dilapidated room shared by Fan Yu and his aunt had a closer resemblance to the drawing.If Fan Yu is really drawing about the house he\u2019s living in and these red people\u2026\u00a0Even the hairs on Chen Ge\u2019s arms stood on end.\u00a0Fan Yu\u2019s house is filled with ghosts\u203dHe was reminded of the scene when he went to visit Fan Yu that morning. The aunt had been incredibly worried while Fan Yu locked himself up in his bedroom with the door and window closed, his head lowered, fully focused on his drawing.Every time, he only used the two colors, red and black. All of his drawings were about a black house and red people, but each drawing had a slight difference. Chen Ge\u2019s lips paled. He clearly remembered that the position of the red people was different in every drawing.He had originally thought that was Fan Yu just scribbling, but now thinking back, they represented the dirty things moving inside the house.Fan Yu can see them?Chen Ge sucked in a cold breath, and more details from when Fan Yu was inside his Haunted House continued to surface. When Chen Ge was talking to the little boy, the latter had kept looking behind Chen Ge, especially at his shadow.Fan Yu had said two sentences inside the Haunted House, and both of them had been directed at Chen Ge. At the time, Chen Ge had assumed that the kid had taken a liking to him, but now he realized that the boy probably treated him as kindred spirit.No wonder he\u2019s afraid of sunlight and likes to visit Haunted House. The boy\u2019s perception has been seriously twisted.\u00a0Chen Ge gripped the phone tightly. He did not know why Fan Yu had turned out that way, but the boy\u2019s various curious actions and the testimony from the woman had led Chen Ge to a scary speculation.In a similarly rainy night a few years ago, the boy had disappeared. Tragedy had befallen his parents after they went to look for him. To able to kill two grown adults and deal with their bodies and crime scene on a stormy night required plenty of careful planning and preparation.Although, viewing this from another perspective, if someone did have the intention to harm Fan Yu\u2019s parents, why would a killer with the ability to hide the bodies perfectly and clear their every trace from the crime scene let Fan Yu go?When his aunt told Fan Yu that his parents had gone to heaven, Fan Yu had examined the well closely because he said that heaven was inside the well. This meant that he knew his parents\u2019 bodies were inside the well. He had seen everything\u2014he was one of the witnesses\u2014so the killer had no reason to let him live.Chen Ge narrowed his eyes slightly as a chill coursed through his body.\u00a0That is unless the killer knew the boy or was the boy himself!Regardless of which one it was, either possibility made Chen Ge\u2019s heart cold with fear.The aunt herself was also a prime suspect. There were way too many plot holes in her story, and when she supposedly went into the kitchen to pour water for Chen Ge, she should not have wasted so much time in there. Then, during the conversation, and even before he left, she had kept reminding Chen Ge to take a sip of the water.At the time, Chen Ge had been too focused on his mission to be careful of her \u2018kindness\u2019, but thinking back, he suspected that something had been done to that glass of water.If it was the aunt who killed Fan Yu\u2019s parents, what was her motive?\u00a0The woman loved Fan Yu to the extent of pampering him. She was blessed with beauty but did not seem to keep up her appearances. It was obvious that it was not easy for her to raise Fan Yu alone. She even spared no expenses to take him to see many doctors. She had put her whole life on hold for Fan Yu\u2019s sake, would such a kind woman really be the killer?To be honest, the thin woman had left a good impression on Chen Ge; he thought she was independent and strong.Then again, if she was not the killer, then the next prime suspect would be the boy himself!He was the crime\u2019s only witness and survivor. Chen Ge did not suspect him initially because he was just a child, but after knowing the secret behind his drawings, Chen Ge realized he had greatly underestimated this child.Fan Yu had a pair of unique eyes, and his constant company was only ghosts. He was not scared by their presence but, in fact, managed to survive just fine. Chen Ge even suspected that he had the ability to control them.This would sound preposterous to others, but not to Chen Ge because he himself was the Specter\u2019s Favored.But if the boy is the killer, what was his motive?\u00a0This was the question that stumped Chen Ge the most. Neither the boy nor the aunt had any actual reason to murder their close family.What really happened on that day? Fan Yu\u2019s parents were ultimately dropped inside Mu Yang High School\u2019s well, but why Mu Yang High School of all places?When Chen Ge placed the drawing back inside his pocket, he realized that the call was still connected, so he immediately apologized to Doctor Gao. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, my attention was otherwise distracted.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNo worries, I was just flipping through the journals to find out more about the patient. In fact, I\u2019m really interested in his case. Do you mind bringing him to see me when there\u2019s an opportunity?\u201d Gao Ru Xue\u2019s father had not hung up; he had waited patiently for Chen Ge.\u201cOf course, should the opportunity arise, we will definitely visit you.\u201d\u201cThank you, this number is my personal number, so call me when you\u2019re coming. Lastly, I have something to remind you.\u201d Teacher Gao sounded like he was hesitating on the phone, as if he was deciding whether he should say something or not.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Chen Ge was appreciative of any advice from this kind doctor.\u201cThe way to treat a patient is with plenty of patience, but it is undeniable that serious patients carry with them a certain degree of threat. When you are in their company, please remember to try not to incite them.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His mind was a clotted mess. If the killer was not Fan Yu, then it had to be Fan Yu\u2019s aunt. They were the prime suspects but also the victims\u2019 closest family.In any case, it is certain that Fan Yu\u2019s aunt is hiding something from me. Something else must have happened that rainy night several years ago.Their closest family turning into their killer, this was a mystery that stumped Chen Ge.The crime scene was at Mu Yang High School, perhaps I can find some clues here.Chen Ge reopened the livestream. The chat was still lagging, but at least the footage had gotten much clearer. After apologizing quickly to his viewers, Chen Ge walked out of the second-floor toilet with his mallet in hand. He stood at the door and waved his flashlight at the floor\u2014there was not anything like footprints.When I was hiding behind the toilet door earlier, I really did hear footsteps. They stopped before the toilet entrance, but the lack of footprints suggests that the owners of the footsteps are not living humans.\u00a0Chen Ge glanced down the stairs. Last he heard, the sets of footsteps did head downstairs.Chen Ge was unsure whether the footsteps belonged to the red shadow mentioned in the mission or not, but for the sake of safety, he decided to avoid it for now. Brandishing his flashlight, Chen Ge headed up to the third floor. However, when he was at the landing between second and third floor, the sound of footsteps reverberated in his ears again.They seemed to be coming from the first floor. Two \u2018people\u2019 standing side by side were heading upstairs.Have they discovered me?\u00a0Chen Ge immediately switched off his flashlight, stuck his back to the wall, and stared closely at the mouth of the staircase.The footsteps did not stop, and they walked onto the second floor.It sounds like they\u2019re heading into the second-floor toilet?\u00a0Just as this thought crossed Chen Ge\u2019s mind, the sound of cubicle doors being opened appeared beside his ears.The cubicle doors were opened one after another, six times. They seemed to be checking the toilet cubicles. Chen Ge leaned closer to the railing and tried to poke his head out to take a closer look at the situation on the second floor.After the cubicle doors stopped moving so did the footsteps. It appeared like everything Chen Ge had heard earlier was part of his imagination. He waited for five minutes on the stairs but could not hear any weird sounds coming from the second-floor toilet anymore.The lack of footsteps means that the walking spirits are now inside the toilet. They\u2019re probably hiding in one of the cubicles, waiting to ambush me.\u00a0Chen Ge might have a powerful heart, but it did not mean that he had no fear. A surprise from inside the toilet cubicle would probably scare him quite a bit.Since the spirit is now hiding inside the second-floor toilet, it\u2019s the perfect opportunity for me to check out the third floor.\u00a0Chen Ge did not turn on his flashlight. Thanks to the Yin Yang Vision, the reward he had received from completing a Nightmare Mission, even though it was not as magical as described by the black phone, it did greatly improve his sight, enabling him to see better than most at night.In the darkened night, thunder flashed occasionally across the sky, giving Chen Ge a temporary glimpse of his surroundings. It created an eerie atmosphere. He feared that one of the lightning flashes might enable him to see things that he did not want to.Chen Ge looked left and right several times as he stood at the entrance to the third-floor toilet. There was nothing in sight, so Chen Ge stepped into the toilet.The third floor\u2019s toilet was even more curious than the ones on the first and second floors. The window was boarded up, and the walls were unstained. The place seemed to have been abandoned even before the school was closed down.All six cubicles were closed, giving Chen Ge a strange feeling that every single of them was hiding a scary surprise. The fifth and sixth cubicles in the first-floor toilet were closed because they were storage rooms for cleaning supplies. Could that be the case again?Chen Ge walked to the first cubicle and leaned toward the door. There was no sound coming from within, definitely no crying of babies or giggles of girls like he had anticipated. Then, he did something even braver. He knelt on the floor and peered through the bottom opening.Empty?There were no random items like mops or brooms, nor was there a pair of legs; it was just a normal cubicle.Chen Ge tried pushing the door, and it opened easily. The cubicle was extremely clean. If not for the layer of dust on every surface, he would have believed that this place was cleaned daily.The whole education block looks like it was burned down in a fire, but this toilet shows no signs of burning\u2014this is similar to that classroom on the first floor.\u00a0This similarity attracted Chen Ge\u2019s attention.\u00a0That basically confirms that this is my mission venue.He pushed open the other cubicles before stopping at the fifth.I have a very bad feeling. Could there be a nasty surprise waiting for me behind this door?\u00a0Chen Ge patted the doll inside his shirt pocket and used his mallet to shove the door open.The door fell open, and when he saw what was inside the cubicle, Chen Ge took an involuntary step back. Drawings of eyes covered every surface inside the fifth cubicle, their sizes similar to actual human eyes.Before opening the door, Chen Ge had tried to envision what could appear behind the door\u2014perhaps it might be pale-faced girl or a scary monster or madman covered with blood\u2014but he definitely did not anticipate this.Why are there so many eyes on the walls and boards?This creepy discovery sent a chill down Chen Ge\u2019s spine. He felt like there were innumerable eyes looking at him. His legs were shaking as he stood outside the cubicle; one could imagine how unsettling it would be inside.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhich psycho did this and why\u203dThe pairs of eyes felt like they were peeping on the people inside the cubicle. Shuddering, Chen Ge hurriedly closed the door again. It felt very unsettling being stared at by so many pairs of eyes even though they were mere drawings.I\u2019ve found the mission venue, but how am I supposed to find this quest? Hide inside the cubicle with all the eyes staring at me while waiting for the red shadow to arrive? Isn\u2019t that asking for a bit too much?Chen Ge stared at the cubicle for a long time before moving to the sixth cubicle. He found the same drawing of eyes inside the sixth cubicle.However, different from the fifth cubicle, the eyes in the sixth cubicle were only drawn on the wall and partition that was shared with the fifth cubicle; the other walls were completely clean.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0Lonelytree\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Millman97Chen Ge was weirded out by the single painted wall in the sixth cubicle. He returned to the fourth cubicle, and he was right; there were no doodles in the fourth cubicle.\u00a0Could it be a mere prank from the students? But why did they pick the fifth cubicle? It\u2019s not the first one or the last one.To get to the truth, Chen Ge returned to the sixth cubicle. He hesitated before walking into it. The water pipes all ran through the sixth cubicle, so the space was much smaller compared to the other cubicles.There\u2019s nothing worth noting here. Do I need to enter the fifth cubicle for the mission to progress?\u00a0Chen Ge looked at the eyes on the wall before raising his finger to lightly touch them.They look scary, but they\u2019re just drawings.\u00a0He was locked in a staring match with the eyes on the wall for a long time.\u00a0The fourth cubicle is normal; the drawings are only in the fifth and sixth cubicle. This partition is unique because it\u2019s covered with drawing of the eyes on both sides\u2026Something slowly clicked in Chen Ge\u2019s mind. He used his finger to slowly move through every drawing on the wall. When his finger touched one of the eyes that was next to his knees, Chen Ge\u2019s expression shifted.It is as I predicted!\u00a0He squatted down and flashed some light on the partition. Underneath his finger was a peephole the size of a human pupil. A small hole had been gauged into the wall. Since its size was similar to an actual pupil and it was hiding in the corner, it was difficult to discover.All the other eyes are to hide this single peephole.\u00a0As Chen Ge looked at the peephole in the wall, he felt weirdly unsettled.\u00a0The peephole connects the fifth and sixth cubicles, meaning someone once used this peephole to spy on the person inside the fifth cubicle from the sixth cubicle!Who would have thought of the many eyes that surrounded the walls, one of them would be real?Since the pipes are gathered in the sixth cubicle, as long as the Peeping Tom climbed on top of the pipes, he wouldn\u2019t be discovered even if someone peeked in from underneath the door. The man had it all thought out.Being looked at in the dark made Chen Ge feel very uncomfortable.Thinking about the mission description, the person that hid in the fifth cubicle was the victim of the Peeping Tom, which could be the red shadow.Now that the secret of the fifth cubicle has been solved, how do I complete the mission? Do I have to stay inside the fifth cubicle for the red shadow to spy on me?Chen Ge waved the mallet in the air. If that was supposed to happen, he would not mind smashing the red shadow\u2019s eye blind.Just as Chen Ge was trying to figure out how to complete the mission, the set of footsteps started again in the corridor, and they were speeding toward the third floor!What\u2019s happening? The footsteps are more urgent than before. Is it because I opened the fifth cubicle? But that does not sound right. I opened the cubicle much earlier, so why are they rushing over now?Before he could come up with an answer, the footsteps had already arrived at the third floor. Chen Ge was standing inside the sixth cubicle, so his only choice was to step into the cubicle and close the door. The moment he did, the footsteps entered the third-floor bathroom.Finally, the time has come.Chen Ge switched off his flashlight and raised his mallet. However, what happened next completely surprised him. After the footsteps entered the toilet, the being did not check the cubicle one after another but headed for the fifth cubicle directly. After the door of the cubicle next to him was closed, the toilet suddenly became very quiet.They\u2019re just beside me, but isn\u2019t the order a bit messed up? According to the mission requirement, it should be me inside the fifth cubicle, right?The silence persisted. After the owners of the footsteps entered the fifth cubicle, there were no more sounds. After waiting for another ten minutes, Chen Ge\u2019s interest in the \u2018person\u2019 next door was slowly piqued. He glanced at the peephole on the wall before squatting down and leaned toward it.The black peephole seemed to have a magical attraction, drawing Chen Ge closer to it.On the other end of the peephole was not a bloodshot eye or a red shadow but two kids about the age of three or four. The boy and the girl hid themselves beside the toilet, holding each other\u2019s hands. They looked intensely worried.Shouldn\u2019t it be a red shadow? Where did these two kids come from?\u00a0Chen Ge pulled his gaze back. The two children next door could not be described with the word scary.Another side mission related to the well mentions a brother and sister. Since the deep well is related to Fan Yu, could these two be the aunt\u2019s son and daughter? But why would they appear here? And they look like they are being chased by something.A series of questions appeared in his mind. Chen Ge gripped the mallet tightly. If his opponent was these two children, he had confidence he could win.I should wait a little longer. I have a feeling that things aren\u2019t that simple.The night darkened, and suddenly, the silence in the third floor toilet was shattered by a new set of footsteps that came from the corridor. Chen Ge pulled the cubicle door open a sliver and looked out. When the footsteps stopped at the toilet entrance, a faded red shadow was reflected on the tiles on the toilet wall.It\u2019s finally here!Chen Ge\u2019s mission target had finally arrived. He did not dare to breathe as his eyes were staring at the door. The sound of footsteps became clearer, signifying that the red shadow had entered the third-floor toilet.Creak\u2026The first cubicle\u2019s door was pulled open, and Chen Ge saw a blurry red shadow poke its head into the cubicle. It stopped for a long time before moving to the second cubicle.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis was the first time in his life that Chen Ge felt the sound of door opening was so grating. Very soon, the doors to the second, third, and fourth cubicles were pulled open, and the red shadow stopped before the fifth cubicle.Watching this unfold, Chen Ge tensed up. His body was like a pressed spring, about to explode at any moment.If he had followed the mission\u2019s instructions, he would have been the one inside the fifth cubicle, and what the red shadow was about to do inside the fifth cubicle would be the thing that should have happened to him.In the silent and dark toilet, the red shadow gripped the door of the fifth cubicle and slowly pulled it open.The room felt like it had turned darker. Children\u2019s cries and laughter appeared from the cubicle next door. The red shadow stood at the door but did not go in. It looked left and right before moving to the last cubicle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was just a thin partition between them. Time seemed to have slowed down for the imminent confrontation.Several seconds later, the red shadow leaned toward the door, and at the same time, Chen Ge raised his mallet. Chen Ge watched as the red shadow made contact with the door. As the door creaked open, every muscle in Chen Ge\u2019s body tensed.Before the door was completely opened, the red shadow had started to phase through the door. Facing the dangerous threat, Chen Ge\u2019s survival instinct caused him to smash his mallet on the red shadow, and in the same motion, he aimed a strong kick at the door!Bang!The decrepit cubicle door understandably could not withstand his assault. It flew off its hinges and slammed into the red shadow, which did not even have the chance to evade. The red shadow did not anticipate this, and its body started to blur as it rolled on the floor. Then it ran out of the toilet.Chen Ge gasped greedily for air. He had expected a fierce battle, but his opponent appeared to have a much weaker heart than he had anticipated. Chen Ge\u2019s sudden appearance seemed to have spooked it.Has the thing forgotten its ghostly identity?\u00a0Chen Ge did not relax as he gripped the mallet tightly. After the red shadow made its escape, children\u2019s crying drifted out from the fifth cubicle. The two kids, who Chen Ge assumed to be the woman\u2019s children, were still inside the toilet.\u201cStop crying!\u201d This was a common trope in scary movies. A creepy sound of tears that came from inside the toilet, it should have been scary, but with an angry warning from Chen Ge, the children\u2019s crying really did stop.He blocked the entrance of the fifth cubicle angrily. The two children had their hands over their lips, their pale faces filled with fear.\u201cWhy are you two acting like the victims\u203d\u201dChen Ge\u2019s emotions were a bit out of control from the intense confrontation with the red shadow. His loud voice combined with the dangerous-looking mallet scared the two kids in the cubicle. They held each other\u2019s hands as they half-crawled, half-ran out of the toilet.Was I being a bit too harsh there?The two children could very well be Fan Yu\u2019s brother and sister. Whether it was for the deep well mission or to investigate the disappearance of Fan Yu\u2019s parents, he had to follow the two children. The two kids ran very fast while Chen Ge chased after them. They soon left the education block and entered the office building next to it.Chen Ge followed closely behind them. When he got onto the second floor, the two kids suddenly disappeared.Where did they go?The interior of the office building was different from the two other buildings at Mu Yang High School; the whole building had been spared from the fire, and it was much cleaner.Chen Ge pushed open a random door and peeked in. The room had two tables and a bookshelf. There was flower pot sitting on the window sill.They disappeared in the blink of an eye, where could they be hiding?After walking deeper into the room, Chen Ge noticed a faded plaque lying on the floor. It read \u2018Mathematics\u2019.All of the mathematics classes at Mu Yang High School were held in this one small room?Chen Ge soon realized why. After all, Mu Yang High School did not have that many students; they could easily fit into one room. Also, fewer students meant a smaller number of teachers; this room was probably the office for the Mathematics teacher as well.He took a cursory look around the room. He discovered a rotten school bag inside the drawer of one of the tables. The bag was tiny and had cartoon prints on it.Chen Ge placed it on the table and opened the zipper. There was a cartoon coloring book and a box of crayons inside.Why would these things be inside the Mathematics teacher\u2019s office?The contents of the school bag did not seem to be for high school students. Chen Ge surmised that the school bag probably belonged to the Mathematics teacher\u2019s child, and the bag had been left behind for some reason.After opening the crayon box, Chen Ge realized that every color was there except red and black. Chen Ge was immediately reminded of Fan Yu. After flipping through the coloring book, Chen Ge\u2019s suspicion was further confirmed. All of the pages had the same drawing, a black house with two red small human figures.All of the drawings\u2019 backgrounds were the black house, but the position of the red people changed every time. Chen Ge pulled out Fan Yu\u2019s drawing from his pocket and placed it beside the coloring book. The comparison caused him to suck a light breath.\u00a0At least the boy\u2019s painting style has remained the same after all these years.The drawings had given Chen Ge plenty of useful information. The rotten school bag and the spider webs that filled the drawer meant that the bag had been shoved inside the drawer way before Mu Yang High School was closed down.This meant that the boy had started to draw ghosts from a young age. His pair of eyes had probably been like that since birth. If the black house in the painting was his home, then starting from several years ago, two ghosts had been residing in the boy\u2019s home.Relating it to the aunt\u2019s testimony and what Chen Ge had seen earlier, the two ghosts were most likely the aunt\u2019s children.After living together for so long, the aunt must know that Fan Yu has a special vision.Chen Ge looked at the two red and black drawings.\u00a0It is because she knew that she was so willing to bring Fan Yu to the Haunted House. She probably pampers Fan Yu thusly because she is channeling her love for three children into that one boy.The appearance of Fan Yu\u2019s school bag also told Chen Ge another thing; this room likely belonged to Fan Yu\u2019s father. He was Mu Yang High School\u2019s Mathematics teacher.From the conversation with Fan Yu\u2019s aunt, Chen Ge knew that Fan Yu\u2019s father had been fired from another school due to drinking. However, Fan Yu\u2019s aunt added that other schools rejected Fan Yu\u2019s father, and he had nowhere else to turn to, which was why he had ended up at Mu Yang High School.This made Chen Ge curious. What kind of mistake had Fan Yu\u2019s father made after drinking that would make him blacklisted from the entire school district and be shown the door by normal schools?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt the time, Chen Ge had wanted to ask, but the topic had quickly been pushed aside by Fan Yu\u2019s aunt when she pulled out the mysterious photo.What kind of person was the missing father like?\u00a0Chen Ge drummed the mallet on the table in thought. He continued to look through the room and finally found several paper notes inside an abandoned book on the bookshelf.\u201cTeacher Fan, we know what you did in the sixth cubicle of the third floor\u2019s female toilets. We demand that you apologize to the girl immediately! And get out of this school!\u201d\u201cYou have two nights to come to a decision. We want an open apology!\u201d\u201cThis is your last night. If you insist on staying at this school, then you shall stay here forever.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Fan Yu\u2019s aunt has been hiding something crucial from me.When Chen Ge was trying to deduce the killer earlier, he had been missing a crucial element, a motive. The notes had provided him with a new line of enquiry.There are three notes, and they have different handwriting. This means that at least three people knew about Teacher Fan\u2019s dirty secret.\u00a0Chen Ge did not touch the notes inside the book. The paper was fragile from the passage of time, and he was afraid that his touch might ruin the key evidence.The handwriting on the paper is very clear. Teacher Fan kept these three notes probably to find the students by comparing the handwriting. After all, Mu Yang High School is small; with the convenience of being a member of staff, three days would have been more than enough time to inspect the handwriting of all the students at this school.Chen Ge memorized the contents of the notes. To be honest, he was rather curious as to how the three students discovered the secret of the cubicle.\u00a0Were they all victims? But that does not seem like that from the tone of the notes, especially the last one\u2014If you insist on staying at this school, then you shall stay here forever. That definitely doesn\u2019t sound like something a victim would say.The message communicated by the three notes was extremely clear, but their demand sounded rather juvenile to Chen Ge. The correct solution to deal with people like Fan Yu\u2019s father was to report to the police and not ask for something like a public apology. If anything, the exposure of the incident might exacerbate the situation, for it might cause further trauma to the victim.The content of these notes does sound like they came from students, could they be the ones who tossed Teacher Fan into the well?Chen Ge had the motive, but the timing was all wrong. There were two adults who disappeared that night. To be able to kill two adults and deal with their bodies without leaving any trace behind did not sound like something that was achievable for several teenage students.I must have missed something.\u00a0Chen Ge tried to look at the situation from Teacher Fan\u2019s perspective. An open apology was definitely out of question. If this thing was exposed, his life would be ruined. He already had a record before coming to Mu Yang High School, and the punishment for repeat offender would be serious.Fan Yu\u2019s father knew about that; it was why he had kept those paper notes. He had probably planned to sniff out the students who had threatened him and deal with them personally, but from the result, it seemed like his three-day search came up with nothing.Here\u2019s the conclusion of everything I\u2019ve found so far. These three notes came from different studies, but even after comparing the handwriting of the students at this school, Fan Yu\u2019s father came up with nothing. These three students discovered the secret of the sixth cubicle, but instead of reporting it to the police, they adopted the method that had the least effect and would easily expose them, which was to threaten Teacher Fan directly. Lastly, the warning on the final note did come true.These three points made zero sense to Chen Ge. To summarize, three students who could not be discovered found out about Teacher Fan\u2019s Peeping Tom habit and, after their warning failed, made Teacher Fan disappear.Individual who fits these three criteria basically doesn\u2019t exist.\u00a0However, Chen Ge already had quite a good idea about who the killer was, but he was still uncertain.The notes also mention a girl whom they want Fan Yu\u2019s father to apologize to. If I can find her, then many problems will be solved.After recording everything with his camera, Chen Ge shut the book and placed it back where it had been.If I did not stay to look through the drawers, I wouldn\u2019t have discovered these notes that are enclosed inside the book. Looks like to solve any mystery, everything starts with the details.Chen Ge exited the mathematics room and went through the other rooms but came up with nothing.It\u2019s already 10:30 pm. There won\u2019t be enough time to complete the remaining two side missions if I continue to slug like this.\u00a0Chen Ge exited the office with the flashlight. He searched the school ground for the well but could not find anything like that even after a one-hour search in the rain.Where could this well be? The black phone cannot possibly be mistaken!\u00a0Chen Ge\u2019s pants and shoes were drenched, and he looked positively haggard.There only half an hour left until midnight; I\u2019ll need to leave the well mission and find shelter.\u00a0Chen Ge lowered his head to hide from the rain as he walked toward the education building. He wanted to reach the sealed classroom before midnight. If the mission was too difficult, the plan was to give up.Chen Ge\u2019s boots felt heavy from the water and every step left a clear footprint on the floor. After entering the education block, Chen Ge headed directly for the sealed classroom. Looking from outside the window, the single table in the middle of the room that had the textbook, pen, and paper on it did look weird.It looks stranger than I expected.Mu Yang High School had originally been a crematorium. Chen Ge read from the online threads that the sealed classroom was exactly the location of the crematorium\u2019s former morgue. It had powerful Yin energy, and that was why the headmaster had kept the classroom sealed.Some said a school bus ran into a huge accident when they were out on a school trip. Many people died, but the spirits of the students still came back to school. The headmaster had to leave this classroom open to accommodate then.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe last explanation was the most inspiring. Before Mu Yang High School was closed, the school was the worst school in Jiujiang. Their collective score was always first\u2026 counting from the bottom. To improve this situation, some of the staff suggested arranging the classes according to their results, the worse the result, the further to the back their class would be. However, this suggestion was vetoed by the headmaster, and he sealed the classroom to tell the students that no one was born in the last place and labelling them as such would be a horrible mistake.There were many other rumors about the sealed classroom at Mu Yang High School, but Chen Ge could only remember these three, which were most discussed.He checked the time again. At 11:36 pm, he opened the door and went into the sealed classroom. Chen Ge moved quickly, and his target was clear, which was to take a closer look at the things on the table at the center.When he entered the room, Chen Ge did not feel that the classroom was any different from outside, perhaps slightly quieter.Chen Ge looked at the textbook and the paper, but there was nothing notable written on them. However, when he picked up the textbook, he discovered there was plenty of writing carved into the wooden table.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Each marking went deep into the surface and spoke of the writer\u2019s pain and desperation. The writings were all collected at the center of the table. Chen Ge bent down toward the table to get a closer look.\u201cThe eyes on the toilet wall came alive! I saw it, the eyes were moving!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why I would imagine that, but from that day onwards, I feel like a pair of eye has been following me.\u201d\u201cThey could be hiding anywhere, inside the drawer, under the bed, behind the pillow.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve lost the courage to even look inside my bag, afraid that a pair of eyes will look back at me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid of being left alone. I don\u2019t dare enter tight spaces. I\u2019m scared of the dark. The moment the lights are switched off, I scream, waking up from a nightmare! I believe I\u2019ve lost my mind, and the pair of eyes is watching me slip down the spiral of insanity.\u201d\u201cWhat should I do? A pair of eyes is following me.\u201d\u201cThey must be hiding somewhere, and they look familiar, but I cannot place them.\u201d\u201cI have told my parents and the class teacher about this, but they brushed me off, saying that I probably need to lay off the heavy studying.\u201d\u201cThey are probably right. I\u2019m probably too tired, or else why would I think the pair of eyes look so similar to the class teacher\u2019s eyes?\u201d\u201cMy parents told the teacher to keep a tab on me, and I know they meant well, but whenever I\u2019m close to the respected class teacher, I just want to grab a pen and jab his eyes blind.\u201d\u201cHave I finally gone off the deep end? I don\u2019t dare tell more people about this. I\u2019m afraid, afraid of the eyes, and afraid that people might call me crazy.\u201d\u201cI pretend to laugh and smile like I used to, but the appearance of the eyes has gotten far more frequent. I don\u2019t know who I can trust.\u201d\u201cI feel like I\u2019m breaking down. Horrible thoughts appear in my mind when I see needles or fruit knives. I find myself wailing for no reason. I want the tears to stop, but I can\u2019t control them. I know they are watching.\u201d\u201cThis cannot go on any longer. I only seek release.\u201d\u201cI hope the rumors about this classroom are real. I am willing to give up everything just to destroy that pair of eyes.\u201dAfter reading everything, Chen Ge did not hurry to leave. He diligently recorded all the handwriting on his livestream. In a way, he was keeping evidence. The writing on the table was seemingly carved by the girl who had been hurt by Teacher Fan.The eyes inside the toilet had traumatized her deeply. That, combined with Teacher Fan\u2019s other actions, pushed her to seek help from this cursed classroom. After she paid her dues, Fan Yu\u2019s parents really disappeared. In a way, those eyes that haunted her were indeed dealt with.Chen Ge realized this sealed classroom played a key role in the whole process. In other words, Teacher Fan\u2019s real killer might have been the things that resided in this classroom.The paper notes with three different sets of handwriting belonged to three people who didn\u2019t exist among the existing student roster and had the capability to kill. If the ghosts inside this classroom were the killers, they did fulfil the three criteria perfectly.Chen Ge looked around him, and his heart started to waver. He was reminded of the group photo that Fan Yu\u2019s aunt had shown him. He might be dealing with more than one or two ghosts. Perhaps a whole classroom of ghosts was trapped there.Chen Ge turned to inspect other tables, and he realized that something was written on each table.Every table is carved with words, but the handwriting are all different.When Chen Ge moved toward the next table, he accidentally knocked into the table on which the textbook, paper, and pen sat. The pen rolled off the edge and fell to the floor.When Chen Ge bent down to pick it up, an arm from beside the table reached out to pick up the pen and hand it to Chen Ge.\u201cThank you.\u201d Chen Ge accepted it and replied on reflex. However, as he straightened up to replace the pen on the table, he froze. A surge of chills climbed up his spine.Where did the arm come from?He aimed his mallet at where the arm had been, but it only made contact with air. He looked around, and the sealed classroom was the same as he remembered. The tables and chairs around him remained unchanged, but Chen Ge\u2019s gaze did change.There\u2019s a classroom at the end of the corridor that\u2019s always sealed. No one ever enters it, but every night, the classroom will come alive with activity, and it\u2019s almost midnight.The mission description crossed his mind. Just the thought of it made him shiver. Surrendering the mission, Chen Ge just wanted to get out of the classroom as fast as he could.The closer he was to the door, the more anxious he became. He anticipated that the door would close at the final moment and he would turn to see the whole classroom filled with \u2018people\u2019. Chen Ge picked up pace and rushed through the door. Thankfully, what he feared did not happen.Looks like this side mission is not accomplishable.\u00a0Chen Ge looked at the classroom and realized the rumors were probably real. The whole class had turned into ghosts and stayed to haunt the place.After closing the classroom door, before he could catch a break, Chen Ge lowered his head and saw something that gave him the shock of his life. There was another set of footprints outside the classroom beside him. The person seemed to have stopped in front of the classroom for a long time before leaving.These look like the prints of rubber shoes; this person came prepared.When he was inside the sealed classroom investigating, there was another individual watching him from outside the window. Chen Ge felt scared. If something had happened to him inside the classroom and he had run toward the door, said person could have easily locked him in from outside.Gripping the mallet in his hand, Chen Ge soon calmed down.\u00a0Footprints can\u2019t be hidden that easily. I\u2019ll need to find this person first before I decide what to do.He followed the footprints, and the other person did not seem like they were planning to hide. The trail of footprints was clear, like they were waiting for Chen Ge to come find them. Chen Ge followed the trail up to the third floor, and he realized that the prints entered the toilet. He put away his phone and slowly pushed the toilet door open.There was a woman in raincoat standing before the fifth cubicle. She looked slender and weak, like she could crumble at any moment.\u201cWhether you\u2019re a human or a ghost, you\u2019re not leaving here until you give me an explanation,\u201d Chen Ge warned while maintaining a three-meter distance from the person.After a long time, the woman removed the hood of the raincoat to reveal her face. \u201cI really didn\u2019t think you would come here. I\u2019m here to save you.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe woman who appeared at Mu Yang High School at midnight was Fan Yu\u2019s aunt.\u201cSave me?\u201d Chen Ge did not believe her fully. Fan Yu\u2019s aunt was still a suspect. He had not forgotten about the woman\u2019s insistence on giving him that glass of water.\u201cYes, I saw Fan Yu\u2019s drawing.\u201d The woman peeled out a wrinkled piece of paper from inside her raincoat. \u201cYou are inside the drawing.\u201d\u201cPlace it on the floor and take a few steps back.\u201dFan Yu\u2019s aunt dropped the drawing and retreated to stand beside the sixth cubicle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He walked forward to pick up the drawing. There was a black building on the paper. The building was filled with red humans, but standing apart from the rest, as if the red humans were afraid to be near it, was an extremely conspicuous black man.\u201cYou said that I am inside the painting. What is your evidence?\u201d Of course, Chen Ge would not buy her story with just a single painting.\u201cThe people inside Fan Yu\u2019s painting have always been red in color. In fact, this is also the first time I have seen a black figure. I thought about it for a long time and deduced that you have to be this black person because in the past month, you are the only outsider who has been to our house.\u201d Fan Yu\u2019s aunt stood in the corner of the room, the rain on her raincoat dripping onto the floor, creating an uncomfortable rhythm.\u201cThat\u2019s all? Then what is the meaning of these red people? What is the difference between the red and the black people?\u201dFan Yu\u2019s eyes studied Chen Ge silently. Just as Chen Ge thought the woman would not tell him the truth, she suddenly said, \u201cThe red figures represent ghosts, and since I\u2019ve only seen one black figure, I assume it represents a living human.\u201d\u201cGhosts?\u201d\u201cI know you won\u2019t believe it, but certain things in this world are inexplicable,\u201d Fan Yu\u2019s aunt said calmly like she had rehearsed this speech many times already. \u201cBefore the accident that happened to Fan Yu\u2019s parents, I knew the boy could see things that normal people couldn\u2019t. I told his parents, but they didn\u2019t believe in things like ghosts.\u201d\u201cSince they didn\u2019t believe it, why do you?\u201d Chen Ge\u2019s curiosity was piqued.\u201cInitially, no one knew that Fan Yu has this power until my husband and two children passed away in a car accident. That was the darkest period of my life. I would collapse whenever I saw their picture. Should that happen, Fan Yu would come to me with his drawings. Two small red children living inside a black house, and he would tell me that the red children are his brother and sister.\u201dThe woman\u2019s eyes softened with warmth. \u201cNaturally, I did not believe him initially; I assumed he was merely trying to make me feel better. But as the number of his drawing increased, my conviction started to shake. I would ask Fan Yu what his brother and sister were doing, and his description would be incredibly detailed. Sometimes, he even mentioned little habits of my children that only a mother would notice and know.\u201d\u201cThat was when you believed Fan Yu can see ghosts?\u201d\u201cYes, or I admit perhaps I wish that it is real. Sometimes, I even see my own child possessing Fan Yu\u2019s body.\u201d\u201cEven if what you\u2019re saying is true, a child\u2019s painting still represents nothing. Don\u2019t tell me every human that appears in his drawing will die?\u201d Chen Ge asked cautiously.\u201cYou can turn over the paper to look underneath it.\u201dFollowing her instruction, Chen Ge turned the paper over. There was another drawing. This time, it was the painting of an old well. Inside the well, several figures that were redder than usual were climbing out, while a black person stood beside the well. Interestingly enough, the location of the black figure inside the well painting overlapped with the black person\u2019s position in the black house on the other side.\u201cAccording to legend, there is an old well at this school that has claimed many lives. The ghosts inside the well are coming out, and you\u2019re standing beside it, meaning you\u2019ve been targeted by the ghosts. If you stay here any longer, accidents might happen,\u201d Fan Yu\u2019s aunt said sincerely. It did sound like she was concerned for Chen Ge.Touching the paper, Chen Ge stared at the drawings for a long time. He frowned slightly as he compared the two drawings, and an answer settled in his mind.\u201cLooks like I\u2019ve misunderstood you.\u201d Chen Ge put Fan Yu\u2019s painting in his pocket, a nonverbal signal that he was not going to return it. \u201cSince I\u2019m planning to leave, let\u2019s go together, this way we can watch each other\u2019s back. This place gives me the creeps.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Fan Yu\u2019s aunt nodded as she walked toward Chen Ge. Chen Ge seemed to have trusted her fully. He turned to walk away, exposing his defenseless back to the woman.The pair walked one in front and one at the back. Chen Ge walked very slowly, holding his mallet. Fan Yu\u2019s aunt behind him seemed to fear being left alone, and she slowly increased her speed. If someone was in front to see Chen Ge\u2019s expression, they would be shocked to see how calculative the glow in his eyes was.As the distance between them drew closer, as Fan Yu\u2019s aunt was about to reach Chen Ge, this slender woman showed a face that was suddenly different from before. Her face was tense, and her hand underneath the raincoat, which was carrying something, reached out to stab Chen Ge!\u201cI knew you are suspicious.\u201d Chen Ge\u2019s reaction was faster than she had anticipated, and the man was crueler than she had thought. The mallet went for her hand, and a kick came soon after.BANG!After Fan Yu\u2019s aunt was knocked into the toilet\u2019s wall, the thing in her palm clattered to the floor. Chen Ge walked toward her and saw it was a paring knife. The thing was small and was normally used to bone meat, an extremely sharp implement.Her hair falling all over her face, Fan Yu\u2019s aunt crawled up from the ground like a vicious ghost. However, Chen Ge did not give her any chance to counter and \u2018helped\u2019 her to the floor again.\u201cI\u2019ve suspected you since I visited your place, but I could not find any proof. Now, you\u2019ve finally shown me your true face.\u201dThe difference in strength was obvious. Fan Yu\u2019s aunt tried several times but could not get up. All she could do was glare at Chen Ge hellishly. \u201cHow did you find out?\u201d\u201cFrom the very beginning, I didn\u2019t trust you, and this drawing provides me with the crucial evidence. The drawing on the back was drawn by your hand. Do you think a child\u2019s art is that easily mimicked? Don\u2019t look at me like that; you\u2019re the one who made the mistake. If you don\u2019t want to get exposed, don\u2019t do the evil deed in the first place.\u201d Chen Ge picked up the paring knife from the floor, and the blade glinted coldly in the dark. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who killed Fan Yu\u2019s parents, right? Regardless of your reason, how could you kill your own family in cold blood?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt was never my intention to kill! You have no idea what really happened that night!\u201d Fan Yu\u2019s aunt lashed out at Chen Ge.\u201cThat is true, but one thing\u2019s for sure\u2014you are one of the killers.\u201d Chen Ge was considering how to immobilize the woman while waiting for the police to arrive.\u201cThe real killer is Fan Yu\u2019s father!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re pushing the blame onto a dead man? That is your argument?\u201d After making sure that Fan Yu\u2019s aunt had no more sharp weapons on her, he relaxed slightly.\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d Fan Yu\u2019s aunt collapsed to the floor, and the truth from years ago finally came out of her lips. \u201cYou must know by now what kind of sick bastard my brother was. It was inside this exact toilet that he caused an innocent girl to go crazy. In the end, I heard that the girl was forced to commit suicide. After that happened, my brother became even more unhinged and increasingly paranoid, often claiming that someone was out to get him. My sister-in-law finally could not stand it and filed for divorce. But my brother refused to let her leave. Forced into the corner, she threatened my brother, saying that if he didn\u2019t agree to the divorce, she would expose his crimes to the world.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He considered it for a whole afternoon before relenting to her demand.\u201d The expression on Fan Yu\u2019s aunt\u2019s face was complicated. \u201cIn retrospect, he was probably figuring out a way to kill her instead of considering the divorce.\u201cThings went as planned for my brother. It was raining cats and dogs the day that he locked Fan Yu up in his office and returned home alone. When we discovered that Fan Yu was not home, we assumed that the boy had gone missing, so all of us went out to go searching for him. My brother led his wife to Mu Yang High School.\u201cWhen I returned home at 9 pm, none of them were there. I was worried, so I also headed for Mu Yang High School to go look for them.\u201cThere was an old well on the hill behind the school. A few days before that, there had been a landslide caused by heavy rain, and the well had been buried. When I arrived, my brother was clearing the soil around the well.\u201cI didn\u2019t see my sister-in-law at first. I called my brother\u2019s name as I walked closer, and when I did, I saw her body stuck at the mouth of the well.\u201cI really didn\u2019t expect him to do something like that; he was such a gentle soul normally, and he really did love his wife. I realized then that my brother has lost his mind. Ever since he brought home that photo and said that he was haunted, I should have known that was the case.\u201cAfter I stumbled across the murder, I was given two choices. One was to help him cover up the body, and the other was to die.\u201cTo save myself, I had no choice but to listen to him. As he ordered, I left some wounds on my sister-in-law\u2019s body and then helped him dig the well open.\u201dFan Yu\u2019s aunt was leaning against the wall, and her eyes were filled with regret. \u201cI knew I had become an accomplice, but the scarier thing was that I didn\u2019t know when my brother would dispose of me. He definitely would not leave any witnesses alive. Perhaps after burying my sister-in-law, he would also toss me inside the well.\u201d\u201cSo, you took the initiative and killed him first?\u201d Chen Ge listened to the woman\u2019s story quickly, and from his perspective, this whole family was abnormal. The husband was a Peeping Tom, and after finding out about it, the wife did not report it to the police but used that as leverage to ask for a divorce.\u201cIf I did not kill him, I would have been killed. And after killing him, I became Fan Yu\u2019s only family, and I did not need to share him with anyone else again.\u201d The last sentence was probably the only truthful word that left the woman\u2019s lips that night.\u201cBut Fan Yu is not even your child to begin with.\u201d Chen Ge believed half of what Fan Yu\u2019s aunt had said. There was no way to confirm things that happened three years ago, and there was no one to counter Fan Yu\u2019s aunt.\u201cYou\u2019re wrong! My children have possessed Fan Yu\u2019s body, and that is why he is familiar with my children\u2019s habits! Fan Yu is not only my brother\u2019s child but also my children!\u201d Green veins started to pop on the woman\u2019s face, and her lips were bleeding from the vehemence of her claim.Seeing her in this state, Chen Ge did not think it was wise to push her further. This woman said that her brother was crazy, but from how he saw it, she was not that normal herself. Her mind had probably snapped when her husband and children passed away in the car accident, and she applied her twisted love on Fan Yu when she realized the boy could see her children\u2019s lost souls.Looking at the distraught woman, Chen Ge was reminded of the mission description given by the black phone\u2014Everyone has a deep well inside their heart where shameful and unknowable secrets stay buried.\u201cGet up, show me to the well where your brother\u2019s body was dumped.\u201d\u201cThe well has already disappeared. After my brother shoved my sister-in-law down the well, I pushed him in. He broke his fall on top of my sister-in-law\u2019s body. He screamed and cursed from inside the well, but no one could hear him because of the heavy rain.\u201d Fan Yu\u2019s aunt pulled at her hair nervously, her arms continuously shaking. \u201cI filled the well up with soil, and three years have passed since then. I don\u2019t even know where to start to look for the well.\u201d\u201cYou only need to give me a general area,\u201d Chen Ge said in a normal tone, but it elicited a violent reaction from Fan Yu\u2019s aunt.\u201cNo one will be able to find them!\u201d Memory struck the woman\u2019s heart like a knife, and her expression twisted with ferocity. \u201cI will raise Fan Yu alone; I will give him all the love he needs!\u201d\u201cIf you really love Fan Yu, you wouldn\u2019t have done this. Your love benefits only yourself; it\u2019s incredibly selfish.\u201d When they were at the Haunted House, he had noticed that Fan Yu preferred talking to Chen Ge, a stranger, than deal with his aunt. It was obvious that they did not share a good relationship.\u201cYou said that the period after your family\u2019s accident was the darkest moment of your life. It was Fan Yu who came to you with comfort by offering you the drawings of your children. He helped you out of sincerity, but you killed his father.\u201d Chen Ge was reminded of the small house that was filled with red figures. If he had not intervened then, things might have gone down a far worse and far crueler route. \u201cYou should be glad that Fan Yu is still a child.\u201dFacing the punishment of the law would be good for both Fan Yu and his aunt. Fan Yu was searching for heaven inside the well, which meant that he had witnessed everything; he knew his aunt was the real killer.As he grew older, he might have repeated what his aunt had done, and with blood on his hands, his life would have been ruined.\u201cIt\u2019s time to give this tragedy its closure.\u201d After ending the livestream, Chen Ge had called the police. With regards to the kind of punishment Fan Yu\u2019s aunt would receive, he really had no clue.\u201cThe boy is forced to live with the killer of his parents. No wonder his psychological development is so stunted, you are the cause of his symptoms.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen Chen Ge called the police, Fan Yu\u2019s aunt shook her head vehemently, and her lips moved before she ran toward the toilet door.\u201cStop struggling.\u201d Chen Ge followed behind her. He was afraid that she might do something stupid.Two of them ran to the first floor. When they passed the sealed classroom, Fan Yu\u2019s aunt suddenly tripped and stayed on the ground for a long time. It felt like someone had yanked on her leg; it was weird to say the least.Chen Ge stopped several meters behind her. Fan Yu\u2019s aunt was collapsed at the door to the sealed classroom, and Chen Ge was feeling apprehensive about this particular classroom.He stuck his back to the wall opposite from the door and leaned to peek into the classroom. It was after midnight. The empty classroom was filled with students, and an old, rotund man was standing at the lectern.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The children sitting at the tables with their heads lowered were similar to the students shot inside her brother\u2019s group photo. After collapsing to the floor, fear was frozen on her face. She tried to stand up, but her limbs refused to listen to her command.\u201cShush!\u201d Chen Ge rushed to the woman\u2019s side to grab her arm and half-dragged her out of the education block!The rumors were real. Regardless of their cause of death, the students had all returned to that classroom.\u201cYou saw it, right? Right\u203d\u201d Seeing them in a picture and seeing them in real life had a completely different feeling. The woman\u2019s eyes bulged out of their sockets, and her breath came haltingly.\u201cLet\u2019s leave this place for now.\u201d Chen Ge dragged Fan Yu\u2019s aunt to the entrance of the education block. Before they left, he turned back to glance at the classroom. The door and windows were closed, and it was completely dark within.I\u2019ve been inside the school for so long already, and they haven\u2019t actively attacked me. Looks like they aren\u2019t malevolent spirits.\u00a0Chen Ge had basis to believe that. The girl who was made insane by Fan Yu\u2019s father had committed suicide in that classroom, and the one who came out to help her was one of the spirits from that classroom. The people who wrote the warning notes to Fan Yu\u2019s father were the spirits. They were trying to protect the school\u2019s students, even though their method was a bit wrong.Chen Ge held Fan Yu\u2019s aunt as they wandered over to Mu Yang High School\u2019s front gate. They stood beside it to avoid the rain. It was already past midnight. Chen Ge did not think it is wise to stay inside that three buildings, plus he had a random variable in Fan Yu\u2019s aunt to be concerned about.At around 1 am, the rain started to slow. There was light coming toward Mu Yang High School. When Chen Ge saw this, he immediately turned on his flashlight and cried for help. As the leaves of the forest parted, a group of people forced their way through in their raincoats.\u201cHere! The suspect has already been detained!\u201d Chen Ge was excited, but when he saw the person who was leading the way, his confidence dwindled.\u201cWhy is it you again?\u201d When Inspector Lee reached the gate and saw Chen Ge, his face began twitching. \u201cThe same person has called the emergency hotline thrice in a week. This is the first time that has ever happened in the station\u2019s 35 years history. Did you know that? Even the officer who answers the calls felt like he can now recognize your voice.\u201dChen Ge was made speechless by Inspector Lee. He too felt embarrassed. He quickly hauled Fan Yu\u2019s aunt off the floor and led her to Inspector Lee. Inspector Lee asked his men to break the school\u2019s gate open, and before entering, he asked, \u201cShe\u2019s also a victim?\u201d\u201cNo, she\u2019s one of the killers.\u201d Chen Ge handed Fan Yu\u2019s aunt over to one of the officers.\u201cOne of the killers?\u201d Inspector Lee flickered his flashlight thrice to alert his men. \u201cThere are other killers still hiding inside the school?\u201d\u201cThe other killer is already dead.\u201d Chen Ge summarized everything he knew for Inspector Lee. \u201cThis woman\u2019s brother was a voyeur, and after the brother\u2019s wife found out, she used it to leverage a divorce. Unwilling to part, her brother killed his wife, and she happened to see her brother do that. To prevent herself from being killed, she killed her brother.\u201d\u201cSo, it was self-defense?\u201d Inspector Lee caught onto the key question.\u201cIf that was the case, she should have reported to the police after that. However, after she killed her brother, she cleared the crime scene and left. The murder happened three years ago, and there is no other witness. Everything I know, it was she who told me.\u201d Chen Ge pointed at Fan Yu\u2019s aunt. \u201cSo, it is not unlikely that she was lying.\u201d\u201cWhere was the crime scene then?\u201d Inspector Lee had skipped even asking why Chen Ge was there. Even the assisting officers took this in their stride like it was not out of the ordinary to find Chen Ge there.\u201cThat, you\u2019ll need to ask her.\u201d Chen Ge also wanted to know the location of the well. That was the last of his four side missions. Inspector Lee was far more experienced than Chen Ge at interrogating. He accepted a clean towel from his men before passing it to Fan Yu\u2019s aunt. \u201cAssault with intention to murder may send you to the chair, but if it was self-defense and the suspect shows signs of remorse, there might still be chance for you to see the light of day.\u201dFan Yu\u2019s aunt gripped the towel silently. She did not look particularly afraid of death.\u201cThink about your family. At your age, you should have your own children by now. If you refuse to cooperate, you might never see them again.\u201d Inspector Lee soon found an opening, and the moment he said that, Fan Yu\u2019s aunt started to waver.After ten more minutes of persuasion, she finally spoke. \u201cThe hiding spot is at the hill behind the school, but I can only remember a general direction.\u201dShe led Chen Ge and the police to a small hill behind the school. \u201cThe bodies were dropped down a well. At the time, there was a landslide, and it covered the well completely.\u201dThere was no road around Mu Yang High School for heavy duty vehicles to enter. Thus, it would require manual labor if they wished to find that well. Chen Ge also considered that point.\u201cInspector Lee, if we do not confirm her words as soon as possible, the case might shift when dawn arrives.\u201d Chen Ge squeezed to stand beside Inspector Lee. His heart was worried about his last side mission.\u201cSeal the scene first, and we\u2019ll wait for the crew to come with the necessary tools before the digging can start.\u201d Without the reminder from Chen Ge, Inspector Lee was already on the phone, arranging everything.At 2:15 am, the crew finally arrived. Inspector Lee assigned everyone their roles, and the digging began in earnest. Chen Ge also went to help by grabbing a shovel. He showed such conviction in his job that the officers were quite touched.At 3 am, the well at Mu Yang High School finally surfaced. At 4.30 am, the well was cracked open, and two bodies were retrieved from within.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt the same time, Chen Ge\u2019s black phone vibrated; he received the mission accomplished message.Putting down the shovel, Chen Ge found a secluded spot and clicked the message open.\u201cYou managed to reach the Mission Location on time, successfully experienced all four side missions, and survived until dawn.

This Trial Mission with a two-star scream factor had been easier than he anticipated, but that was probably because the spirits inside Mu Yang High School meant him no harm.When he was halfway through the mission, he had already noticed that the residents of Mu Yang High School were not baleful specters. Including the Pen Spirit, they had no malicious intent. What had happened to Fan Yu\u2019s father was merely karma.The most difficult side missions were definitely the classroom and the deep well. Even now, he still had not truly uncovered the mystery of the Sealed Classroom. He did go in to experience it once, and thankfully, the spirits inside did not make things too difficult for him. The difficulty of the Deep Well mission was high as well. Even with the aid of the police, they had dug for a whole night before locating the well before dawn. If he had attempted that alone, he definitely would have failed the mission.Chen Ge felt satisfied with the rewards. He did not mind too much about the unlocked hidden item. According to legend, Pen Spirits could predict the future, but his Pen Spirit did not seem to be knowledgeable about anything and had no principles or morals.The rain that had continued throughout the night finally stopped. The police did not forget to praise Chen Ge for his contribution. After taking his testimony, they drove him home. The emergency call and a whole night of digging had led to tired officers. Inside the car, the one sitting next to Chen Ge was falling asleep. Chen Ge nudged his own body to the door to make space for the officer. The journey home was silent.Chen Ge arrived at New Century Park at 6 am. It could have been the Yin Yang Vision or constant exposure to spirits, but Chen Ge felt incredibly cold. He lay in his bed, but sleep would not come. He turned to his phone and was shocked to realize there were more than ten unanswered calls and unread messages.Most of them came from He San, mainly asking about his safety and whether he needed to call the police. At the bottom of the inbox was a message from Doctor Gao. The good doctor said that Fan Yu\u2019s symptoms might be related to the people around him, and he advised Chen Ge to pay closer attention to such individuals in the boy\u2019s life.The message was sent at 12:30 am. By then, Fan Yu\u2019s aunt had come clean to Chen Ge. After replying to both He San and Doctor Gao, Chen Ge opened the video-sharing app and clicked into his personal page.A four-hour livestream but not a word with the chat, and I even closed the stream several times in the middle without warning. I can only imagine the damage that was done to my popularity.After detaining Fan Yu\u2019s aunt, Chen Ge had closed the livestream in deference to Fan Yu\u2019s privacy and future. He did not have the time to explain the situation to his viewers; his attention had been required elsewhere.After loading the main page, Chen Ge glanced at the interface and was shocked to realize that his livestream\u2019s followers had increased to 39,000 users.I remember, before the livestream, I had less than 10,000 followers. What happened last night during the livestream?He had been so occupied with the side mission that he had allowed the livestream to play on its own. He did not think too much of it, so he was surprised by this sudden reward.Just as Chen Ge was trying to figure out what had happened, He San\u2019s call came. As he answered it, he could hear the commotion on the other side. \u201cBoss! I knew you\u2019re still alive!\u201dChen Ge ignored He San\u2019s celebration and asked directly, \u201cWhat happened last night during my livestream? Why did my followers and views grow so tremendously?\u201d\u201cSince you started your livestream last night, the number has been growing, but it was incredibly slow until you started to play the Pen Spirit game. Someone created a thread on the app forum exposing Qin Guang for his plagiarism and then even attached your first livestream.\u201d He San\u2019s voice turned sharp from indignation. \u201cQin Guang\u2019s livestream plagiarized your content down to the analysis, set, and even the identity of the killer, who was played by an actor! The evidence was right before their eyes, but Qin Guang\u2019s fans refused to admit it. They started to slander your name in the thread, saying that it was you who was mimicking their idol.\u201d\u201cProbably just\u00a0the 50-cent army\u00a01\u00a0, nothing unusual. Then what happened next?\u201d\u201cMany viewers went to Qin Guang\u2019s livestream to demand an explanation, but Qin Guang pretended not to have seen them. Not only that, he banned any viewers who brought up your name. However, with his high popularity and the all-in promotion by the platform, there were 800,000 viewers at the start of his livestream, and with the chat scrolling so fast, his team missed some of your mentions. Thus, a number of his viewers who were curious came over to your livestream.\u201d He San got increasingly excited. \u201cThe highest viewers during your livestream was 50,000 but it was the combination of passersby, paid viewers, Qin Guang\u2019s fans, and your own fans; it was a mess! You don\u2019t have any mods in your livestream, so even after the livestream had stopped, the chat kept going for another half an hour. By the way, thanks to this chaos, your livestream entered the Popular Ranking for the midnight session. Congratulations, not many newbie hosts can enter that ranking so early in their career.\u201dChen Ge could imagine the chaos in his livestream last night, but it was a blessing in disguise since his follower number did have a tremendous increase. After all, he was not lacking in content but exposure.\u201cSlow down. After all, that was just my second livestream.\u201d Chen Ge talked for a few more minutes with He San before hanging up.He looked at the private messages that he had received from the other users of the app. Most of them were curses, but there were a few who could not stand Qin Guang\u2019s bullying and chose to send Chen Ge their support.Near the bottom of his inbox, Chen Ge recognized a familiar user handler. The profile picture was similar to the studio that had harassed him before. The message warned him to not resort to dirty tricks, or he would make sure Chen Ge was unable to survive on this platform.If another host saw this, they might have been afraid, but Chen Ge was different. Livestreaming and posting short videos were merely ways for him to promote his Haunted House. After blocking this account, Chen Ge exited the app and picked up the black phone.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMu Yang High School (Scream Factor 2 Stars): The setting up of the scenario has been completed, you can now go down to the subterranean level to visit it.\u201cWarning: Mu Yang High School is considered part of the four-star scenario, School of the Afterlife; its space is twice the size of a normal scenario. Please familiarize yourself with the interior layout before putting it to use.\u201dAfter looking at the message on the phone, Chen Ge sat up in bed.\u00a0The size is twice normal scenario\u2019s? Wait\u2026 don\u2019t tell me, the whole of Mu Yang High School has been moved here?He put on his shoes and ran to the first floor, peeled off the wooden boards, and peered downward.The abandoned underground parking lot had been given a new look. The stairs had signs of being charred, the darkened corridor was littered with unfinished test papers, the doors to the classrooms creaked in the darkness, and shadows could be seen flitting between the upturned tables.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The size of Mu Yang High School\u2019s scenario was so much larger than Murder by Midnight. As he took a step into it, a cold draft caressed the back of Chen Ge\u2019s neck. It made him feel unsettled, like something might jump out at him from the dark at any moment.Four classrooms, corridors, toilets, and offices\u2026Everything that Mu Yang High School had was perfectly replicated inside Chen Ge\u2019s Haunted House, but the layout was rearranged so that it was all closer together.Walking down the dim corridor, Chen Ge could not help himself from turning to look into the classrooms on both sides. The walls beyond the windows were cement wall, and there could not be drafts underground, but the windows kept on creaking like they were touched by the wind.The first few classrooms were creepy but still acceptable; however, when Chen Ge reached the sealed classroom at the end of the corridor, the hairs on his body stood up. This was the first time he had felt such intense fear inside his own Haunted House.This classroom reminded him of the sealed classroom at Mu Yang High School, but it was not completely the same. Every table had writing scrawled all over it with red paint, but more scarily, there was a set of school uniform sitting on each chair.The uniform was a perfect match to the uniforms Chen Ge had seen in the group photo taken with Fan Yu\u2019s father. The only difference was that, in the picture, all the students were facing away from the camera, but in this classroom, all the uniforms were turned toward Chen Ge, who stood at the door.After taking a deep breath, Chen Ge forced himself to walk into the room. Standing at the lectern, looking down at the room, the rows of chairs felt like they were seated with students.Why did only this classroom come with school uniforms? Could these uniforms represent the lingering spirits that remained here?\u00a0Chen Ge counted the school uniform silently; there were twenty-four uniforms in total.After completing the Murder by Midnight Trial Mission, the Haunted House\u2019s scenario became the new home for Xiaoxiao\u2019s family. If I follow this similar train of thought\u2026\u00a0Chen Ge\u2019s face twitched with discomfort. It meant that there were twenty-four lingering spirits who had moved into his Haunted House.Then again, I might be wrong.\u00a0Chen Ge exited the classroom, closed the door, and continued to move forward.At the end of the corridor was the toilet, and a few steps past that brought Chen Ge to the first junction. The left turn led to the office area while right led to the female dormitory.Chen Ge took the right turn. He only took several steps when the corridor turned narrow. The rooms on both sides felt like they were closing in on him, and at the end of the corridor was another junction.Just a two-star scenario is already so complicated. If I unlock a few more scenarios, this underground parking lot will definitely become a Maze of Terror.He pushed open a random door, and the interior was designed like a crime scene.It was worth noting that Chen Ge discovered a row of chairs placed side by side in the second last bedroom, and several pieces of paper and a greatly damaged ballpoint pen were placed on top of one of them.This is the hidden item for unlocking Mu Yang High School\u2019s scenario?\u00a0Chen Ge picked up the ballpoint pen gingerly. It was so fragile that it looked like it could crack at any moment.\u00a0Hidden items seem to have their own purpose. Wang Qi\u2019s Hidden Person Notice helped me befriend Xiaoxiao\u2019s family, and they now help me maintain the Murder by Midnight scenario. Could it be possible that this ballpoint pen will help me win the favour of the students in the sealed classroom?Chen Ge could not figure out how. Eventually, he exited the scenario with the ballpoint pen in hand. He returned to the staff breakroom to fix the pen with tape.\u201cPen Spirit, Pen Spirit, I know you hold a grudge against me, but I\u2019ve fixed your pen. If you have forgiven me, please draw a circle on the paper.\u201d\u201cPen Spirit, Pen Spirit, you are my spirit from my previous life, and I am your spirit in this life. If you are with us, please draw a circle on the paper\u2026\u201dTo solve the mystery related to the sealed classroom, asking the Pen Spirit would be the most direct solution. However, no matter how hard Chen Ge chanted its invocation, the Pen Spirit refused to answer.\u201cWhy so silent? I\u2019m also a victim in this case, okay?\u201dChen Ge had no choice but to return the pen to the female dormitory. He took a tour around the place before returning to the first floor.The twenty-four uniforms in the sealed classroom were scary, but the impact was not enough. When I have time, I should update the models in the Night of the Living Room, put the uniforms on them, and placed them in the classroom. That should up the fear factor quite a bit.\u00a0Chen Ge closed the wooden boards and was about to return to bed when his phone rang.He turned to take a look and was surprised to see that it was from Inspector Lee.\u201cUncle San Bao? How can I help you?\u201d When Chen Ge returned from Mu Yang High School, Inspector Lee had stayed. He seemed to have been talking with the officers from the main city\u2019s investigation team.\u201cIf you\u2019re not too busy, do you mind coming to the district police station? The killer wants to talk to you.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Chen Ge was confused, but he still agreed so as to give face to Inspector Lee. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be there in a minute.\u201dWhen he arrived, a familiar officer led Chen Ge to the interrogation room. Fan Yu\u2019s aunt was sitting in the chair, her hands in cuffs.\u201cThe autopsy for the bodies is still going on. The suspect\u2019s emotions are very unstable, and she refuses to say anything. Her only demand is to talk to you in person, and that was why I called you.\u201d The middle-aged officer in the interrogation room stood up and shook Chen Ge\u2019s hand. \u201cThen, I shall leave you to you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try my best.\u201d Chen Ge walked to Fan Yu\u2019s aunt. In just one night, she seemed to have gotten even wearier than usual. Her head was lowered, and her hair covered her face.When she felt someone approach, the woman\u2019s eyes, which had been distracted earlier, started to focus on Chen Ge. They spoke of complicated emotions.\u201cYou asked for me?\u201d As Chen Ge tried to get near, he was stopped by the officer, who wished for him to maintain a safe distance.Fan Yu\u2019s aunt nodded slightly. She was silent for a long time, and the first sentence out of her mouth surprised Chen Ge. \u201cDo you have the drawing I gave you in the third-floor toilets?\u201dIf she did not bring this up, Chen Ge would have forgotten all about it already. He retrieved the drawing from his pocket and placed it before Fan Yu\u2019s aunt. Looking at the weird drawing, Fan Yu\u2019s aunt did not feel afraid. In fact, it felt like she treated it like some kind of treasure. Then again, that was too be expected; after all, when her husband and children passed away, it was with these drawings that she slowly walked out from her despair.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEventually Fan Yu\u2019s aunt\u2019s spoke. \u201cI\u2019ve done everything I could for Fan Yu for three years, but the first living person who showed up in his drawing is you, how is that fair?\u201d\u201cThings might not be as simple as you think. Fan Yu probably thinks I\u2019m similar him.\u201d Chen Ge pointed at his eyes. \u201cWe can see the same thing.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Fan Yu\u2019s aunt lowered her head again, and the interrogation room became quiet.\u201cIs this why you called me here?\u201d Chen Ge folded the drawing up neatly.After ten minutes, Fan Yu\u2019s aunt collected herself; it was as if she had come to a decision. She told Chen Ge in a soft voice, \u201cI am Fan Yu\u2019s only remaining family, and I will have to leave him soon. The boy has a weird personality and is unable to make any friends. I do not ask that you take him on, but I plead that you go visit him when you have time. Talk to him and make sure he isn\u2019t bullied by the other kids.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In this whole incident, Fan Yu was the most innocent.\u201cActually, you don\u2019t need to worry so much.\u201d The officer behind the desk also walked over to say, \u201cWe have already contacted child services. If you truly repent, you might still have the chance to see your child in the future.\u201d\u201cMy child?\u201d Fan Yu\u2019s aunt looked at that officer, and her blank expression slowly shifted. Her lips fell open as she stared at a spot above the officer\u2019s shoulder, and for some reason, she smiled. \u201cOkay, I will tell you everything I know.\u201dThey then entered the normal interrogation process. Chen Ge felt he was not needed there anymore, so he asked to leave. After exiting the station, he hailed a cab to go to Fan Yu\u2019s home.The incident might appear to have reached its conclusion on the surface, but there was still a huge question that had not been solved, a question that only Chen Ge knew and only Fan Yu could provide the answer to.The sun was coming up, but its rays seemed to be unable to penetrate the maze-like alleyways. After exiting the taxi, Chen Ge walked deeper into the alleys, following his memory.Eventually, he found the place that Fan Yu\u2019s aunt rented. He knocked several times on the second-floor door before he heard the lock being moved from within, and the door opened a sliver. Chen Ge pushed it open, and to his surprise, there was no one standing behind the door. He stood at the entrance for a long time, and even with the sunlight falling on him, he did not feel a trace of warmth.\u201cFan Yu?\u201d Chen Ge stepped into the room, and he felt even chiller. The living room and kitchen were empty. Chen Ge shuffled toward the bedroom. He tried to push on the door, and similar to before, the door was not locked and was pushed open easily.Heavy curtains blocked all the light in the room, and the lights were not on. The place was dim, and the floor was littered with paper. Chen Ge picked up a random piece, and it was still a drawing of a black house crowded with red people.\u201cWhy did you toss these drawings away? Are you not satisfied with them?\u201d Chen Ge held the drawing in his hands while he looked toward the table. Fan Yu sat on the chair, facing away from him. The boy looked like he was spacing out.Chen Ge avoided the drawings on the floor carefully, and when he walked closer, he saw there was one last drawing that was left on the table. On the white paper, a black crayon was used to draw the outline of a house, and a small black figure was standing isolated in the middle of it.\u201cWhat happened to the red people?\u201dChen Ge did not expect Fan Yu to answer, but Fan Yu turned his head to look at him and whispered, \u201cThey have found a new home.\u201d\u201cMeaning, they have moved away?\u201d Chen Ge was reminded of the twenty-four uniforms he had seen inside his Haunted House and something clicked. \u201cAre you friends with them?\u201dThe boy shook his head. With his eyes on his drawing, Fan Yu reached into his drawer to pull out a paper box to give Chen Ge.\u201cFor me?\u201d Chen Ge looked into the box, and inside sat twenty-four school name tags with twenty-four different names. In the middle of the box was a photo group, and twenty-four students stood facing away from the camera.These twenty-four name tags should reveal the mystery behind the sealed classroom, and now Fan Yu had handed them to Chen Ge. After surrendering the box, Fan Yu stopped saying anything. Chen Ge had no idea what the boy was thinking.Neither of them said anything. Looking at Fan Yu, Chen Ge did not have the heart to ask the question that was on his mind. Suddenly footsteps came from the corridor, and soon, a man and woman appeared at the door.\u201cThis should be the place.\u201d\u201cWhy isn\u2019t the door locked? Fan Yu? Are you inside?\u201dHearing them, Chen Ge ran out to see what was wrong. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d\u201cWe are workers from Jiujiang Children\u2019s Home; this is our identification. We are here to take Fan Yu for a physical check-up and then follow up on the documentation for his future,\u201d the woman explained as they both looked at Chen Ge with suspicion. They did not understand why an unknown man had appeared at Fan Yu\u2019s home.\u201cFan Yu is inside the bedroom. The boy is very independent, so please do take care of him.\u201d\u201cWe will; that is our job.\u201d The woman entered the bedroom to fetch Fan Yu while the man stood outside to keep an eye on Chen Ge. They did not seem to trust him. Realizing that the woman had stepped into this territory, Fan Yu\u2019s reaction was rather agitated. He grabbed the drawing on the table and ran outside like he was trying to make an escape.\u201cGrab him!\u201d the woman yelled from inside the house. The man at the door heard her, and when Fan Yu ran to his side, he grabbed at the boy\u2019s arm. The man was experienced at dealing with troublesome children. Very easily, he pinned down Fan Yu\u2019s arms. This way, he would not be scratched by Fan Yu, and Fan Yu had no opportunity of harming himself.Fan Yu struggled like his life depended on it. This greatly unsettled Chen Ge, and after some negotiation with the man, he finally released Fan Yu. Fan Yu, who was released, did not attempt to make another escape. He gripped the drawing silently, like he knew running would be futile.Watching Fan Yu being led way, Chen Ge could not hold it in anymore. He chased after the boy and squatted down before him to ask a question that had troubled him for a long time.\u201cYou know heaven is inside the well, and you witnessed everything, so why didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d Chen Ge had never treated Fan Yu as a normal boy\u2014the house of red people had prevented him from doing that.A blank-faced Fan Yu thought about it for a while when he heard Chen Ge\u2019s question. In the end, he did not answer but raised his head to flash an innocent smile at Chen Ge.As he watched Fan Yu leave, Chen Ge\u2019s back started to become drenched with sweat. This was the first time he had seen the boy smile. Hugging the paper box with twenty-four names and the photo that had been given to him by Fan Yu, Chen Ge returned to New Century Park.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe trip to the police station and then Fan Yu\u2019s place had taken up plenty of time. When he arrived at New Century Park, it was already past 10:30 am.After the whole night of rain, the sun was shining brightly. Chen Ge\u2019s mood also improved when he saw the crowd that had gathered inside the park. As he entered the park, he immediately noticed the crowd that had formed outside his Haunted House.Initially, he had thought those were customers, but he realized he was wrong when he got closer. None of them were lining up for tickets but very unreasonably blocked the entrance from other real visitors.What\u2019s happening?\u00a0Chen Ge walked over and realized that Uncle Xu was also there, negotiating with the unruly crowd.When they saw Chen Ge approach, they quickly surrounded him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why are you so late for work?\u201d Uncle Xu pulled Chen Ge to stand behind him, afraid that the mob might harm the young man.\u201cI just came back from the district station; I was helping the police with a murder case.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Not only Uncle Xu, even the mob who surrounded Chen Ge was shocked. Normally, the reason given for truancy was either a traffic jam or stomach ache; being involved in a murder case was truly an excuse they had not heard about before.\u201cMurder case?\u201d Uncle Xu looked at Chen Ge with shock and had forgotten the urgent matter at hand.\u201cYup, but the case is different from the earlier murder at the apartment; it probably won\u2019t be broadcasted on the mass media.\u201dThere was an earlier murder?\u00a0The raging mob\u2019s aggression suddenly dwindled.\u201cAlright, leave this to me.\u201d Chen Ge stood facing the crowd and said, \u201cYou guys are looking for me?\u201dWith just one question, Chen Ge managed to extinguish the little momentum the mob had left. The crowd that blocked the entrance to the Haunted House looked at each other before shoving out a middle-aged man, who was shortest among them, to face Chen Ge.\u201cWe are from Qin Guang\u2019s studio. Last night, you employed unethical tactics by hiring a 50-cent army to spread rumors that are damaging to Qin Guang\u2019s reputation.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the one who employed unethical tactics? You people sure know how to create story. Who the real unethical plagiarist here is, you know yourselves.\u201d Chen Ge cut the man off instantly. \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, please leave the premises; you are interrupting my business.\u201d\u201cQin Guang merely chose to have the livestream at the same location as you. That is not a basis for you to claim that he plagiarized your work simply because you happened to shoot at the location first.\u201d The middle-aged man stood his ground and tried to argue with Chen Ge.\u201cA simple comparison between our livestreams show that Qin Guang mimicked even my starting analysis while trapped inside the bedroom. If that is not plagiarism, what is?\u201d\u201cAt most, he only copied your beginning. The plot that developed after that was his own creativity. Of course, it cannot be called plagiarism. At the very worst, you can call it a homage.\u201dChen Ge had never seen such a shameless person before. He knew reasoning with them would be a waste of time, so he walked past them to open the gate and prepare for business.\u201cYou are new to the scene, so we understand your drive to succeed, but you have to know that this job is not that easy.\u201d The middle-aged man pulled out a document from his bag. Chen Ge had initially thought it was some kind of lawyer\u2019s letter, but he had overestimated his opponent\u2019s conviction.\u201cYou are not from this field, so you don\u2019t understand certain things\u2014that\u2019s fine\u2014but most established hosts are made with gold and popularity. It might appear that you have caught some popularity for now, but the platform will never support a newcomer and abandon Qin Guang because Qin Guang is the platform\u2019s key promoter. His success is tied to the success of the platform itself.\u201d The middle-aged man waved the document in his hand. \u201cIf you agree to stop the malicious attacks against Qin Guang and post a public apology on your personal account, we will compensate you accordingly. However, if you insist on walking down the wrong place and harassing Qin Guang and any of his affiliates to brush up the popularity of your own livestream, we will contact the platform to block you from all of its channels.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t try to shift the blame onto the viewers; they are completely innocent. If anything, the viewers simply cannot stomach the open bullying and came to support me.\u201d Chen Ge did not give a damn about the threat. After all, the platform had never helped him once before. Even he himself did not know how he had managed to achieve his current popularity.\u201cBeing rash benefits no one, why don\u2019t you think about it first?\u201d The middle-aged man\u2019s attitude softened; the unreasonableness that was evident before Chen Ge arrived had completely disappeared. Around six of them had come to create trouble for Chen Ge, but the first sentence out of the man\u2019s lips when he arrived had thrown a wrench into their plan. Then again, they could not totally be blamed. Any normal person would be cautioned when they realized that the person they were dealing with had been involved in not one but two murder cases.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to consider. I\u2019ve already discovered the unique selling point of my livestream and videos. Even if I\u2019m forced to leave this platform, I\u2019ll just regain my follower base elsewhere.\u201d Chen Ge chased the people from Qin Guang\u2019s studio aside and informed Xu Wan to start preparing for work.He had raced about the whole night, so he was tired. He sat in the ticket booth selling tickets. After the first few waves of visitors exited the Haunted House, the people from Qin Guang\u2019s studio returned.\u201cYou people sure are insistent! If you\u2019re not here to visit the Haunted House, please move aside; you\u2019re blocking the path for the real visitors!\u201d Even a saint would lose their temper when pushed too hard. Chen Ge had been polite enough, but these people kept testing his patience.\u201cWho said we\u2019re not here to visit the Haunted House? We also wish to experience the place that is dubbed the scariest Haunted House in Jiujiang.\u201d Two young men from the studio with backpacks blocked the gate.\u201cYou also want to visit the Haunted House?\u201d Naturally, Chen Ge suspected that these people were up to no good.\u201cIf you\u2019re afraid that we might expose your fake advertising, then fine, we won\u2019t enter.\u201d Of the two young men, one was extremely well-built. He wore a tank top to purposely reveal his body that was the result of constant weight training.Honestly, Chen Ge was a bit taunted by this guy. \u201cLet me remind you, the last person who made a claim like yours came out lying on his back.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve only managed to arouse my interest even more.\u201d Standing beside the muscular man was a meek looking bespectacled man. \u201cI\u2019ve watched scary movies since I was young. Before being recruited by Brother Qin, I was part of a scary movie film crew. Alas, most of the movie settings were too fake; they were barely challenging.\u201d\u201cI do love customers like yourself who are constantly searching for a greater scare.\u201d Chen Ge pulled the curtain back. \u201cCome in then, remember to sign the disclaimer agreement.\u201dSince there were willing lab rats, Chen Ge naturally would not send them away. Even the smile on his face had turned several degrees sincerer.When Uncle Xu saw the smile on Chen Ge\u2019s face, he shivered involuntarily, and the image of the forensic science students from Jiujiang Medical University lying weakly on the floor appeared in his mind.Uncle Xu coughed and pulled him to the side. \u201cXiao Chen, don\u2019t go overboard. Remember, they are still park visitors.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBefore Chen Ge could reply, the bespectacled young man thought that he had seen through their plot and scoffed with derision, \u201cWell, well, well. That\u2019s some pretty good acting. The experience has started even before we enter the Haunted House?\u201cBefore I arrived, I saw the reviews on the Haunted House, and many people said that the owner knows a bit of psychology. It looks like they weren\u2019t lying.\u201dUncle Xu looked at the young man with a speechless expression on his face.\u00a0I\u2019m trying to help you here. If not for the fact you might die inside there, I would not have cared about you!\u201cUncle Xu, I know the limits. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d Chen Ge led the two young men into the Haunted House personally and saw them sign the disclaimer agreement.The larger, muscular man was called Zhu Jianing, and the bespectacled man was Fei Youliang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There are four different scenarios for you to experience; they are the Sealed Classroom, the Fifth Cubicle in the Toilet, the Pen Spirit, and the Deep Well. The clues to the exit are hidden within these four scenarios. You\u2019ll need to experience all of them before you can find the exit.\u201d Chen Ge looked through their disclaimer agreement repeatedly. He was so careful because the agreements might serve their purpose soon enough.\u201cThis is not our first Haunted House; we know all that.\u201d Fei Youliang pushed on his spectacles and peered inside the Haunted House. \u201cAt least the suspenseful environment is not bad.\u201d\u201cIn that case, I will not waste my breath anymore.\u201d Chen Ge had intended to make some small introduction to each of the small scenarios, but he decided that would not be necessary. \u201cFollow me.\u201dChen Ge led the two young men to the entrance to Night of the Living Dead on the first floor. The two saw the dilapidated setting and less than desirable mannequins that populated the scenario.\u201cThe style is from ten years back.\u201d\u201cHonestly, with set pieces like these, I feel like I can sue you for overcharging me for the entrance ticket.\u201dZhu Jianing and Fei Youliang wandered into the Night of the Living Dead scenario and touched the dust that had gathered on the mannequins. \u201cJust how long has this place been deserted?\u201d\u201cLooks like the business is dying. I should have known that you would have hired the same 50-cent army to fill the comments with good reviews.\u201d\u201cAre you two done?\u201d Chen Ge raised the wooden boards from the floor. \u201cThe entrance is here.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s underground?\u201d The two young men did not feel weirded out. They walked out of the Night of the Living Dead scenario with their backpacks and stopped before the staircase that led down the stairs.The dark corridor led into an abyss. The doors to the classrooms on both sides creaked creepily, and even before they got down the stairs, a chilling wind surged from within to caress their skin.\u201cNow\u2026 this is\u2026 better.\u201dAs the two young men entered the Mu Yang High School scenario, Chen Ge yelled from the entrance, \u201cIf you\u2019re really afraid, yell for help at the cameras\u2014the workers will come help you.\u201dAfter closing the boards, Chen Ge suddenly realized that there was no surveillance installed in the Mu Yang High School scenario, and there was not really an exit. He had just been saying that earlier out of habit.\u00a0Looks like I better go in to join them. Hopefully, their minds are still intact when I reach them.He had Xu Wan stay at the door to maintain the order. He put on the Doctor Skull-cracker outfit and entered the main control room to switch the background music to Black Friday before entering the Mu Yang High School scenario with the box of nametags given to him by Fan Yu.\u2026After Zhu Jianing and Fei Youliang descended the staircase, they stayed near the entrance. Both of them waited until Chen Ge closed the wooden boards before they made a signal and retrieved Bluetooth cameras from their backpacks and pinned them on their chests.\u201cEach of us will record our side. We\u2019ll film everything inside his Haunted House, and after we solve it, we\u2019ll post the guide online.\u201d\u201cWill that achieve anything?\u201d\u201cFor local Haunted Houses like this one, the design and traps of the scenarios are considered business secrets because they depend on them to attract visitors. If the guide is already posted online, then it would have lost all its allure. This is why Haunted Houses ban the usage of cameras and video recorders. They have to keep the mystery and anticipation up for future visitors.\u201d Fei Youliang fixed his camera and walked in front. \u201cAfter shooting the video, we\u2019ll edit it to make it as boring as possible, and then after posting it online, we\u2019ll hire some 50-cent army to swamp his comments with bad reviews.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d After he looked around, Zhu Jianing added, \u201cBut I have to say, the man has put a lot of effort into his setting; it does feel like we\u2019re at an abandoned high school.\u201d\u201cAt the end of the day, it is still fake. In comparison to the 3D scary movies I\u2019ve seen, this is nothing.\u201d Fei Youliang was not afraid; if anything, he was bored. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with.\u201dThe two walked down the dim corridor. On each side of them were empty classrooms. The doors creaked on their hinges, and weird noises occasionally drifted out from the classrooms.\u201cDo you think the exit will be inside these two classrooms beside the entrance? After all, the comments did say that the boss is a master manipulator.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s your first mistake. If you focus too hard on searching for the exit, you will have fallen for the man\u2019s scheme.\u201d When Fei Youliang was talking, he did not forget to maintain the balance of his upper body. Both he and Zhu Jianing were expert cameramen.\u201cYou\u2019re right. Thankfully, you came with me.\u201d\u201cIn reality, Haunted Houses are very boring. It\u2019s just people scaring people, and if you take it too seriously, you lose.\u201dThe end of the dark corridor was still nowhere to be seen. Even though they said that they were not afraid, their progress was glacially slow. The signs of a fire could be seen everywhere, and the unique scent of burning was mixed in the stall air.As living humans entered the scenario, the atmosphere inside Mu Yang High School slowly changed. In an unseen corner, many pairs of eyes slowly opened.Fei Youliang, who walked forward, was a scary movie aficionado. As authentic as the setting was, it was not scary enough to make him feel afraid yet. In comparison, the muscular man, Zhu Jianing, started to wilt under pressure. He hid himself behind Fei Youliang, and his eyes kept wandering about to the dark corners.The background music was not that scary, but it made his heartrate race and his breathing uneven. Fei Youliang suddenly stopped, causing Zhu Jianing to walk into the man\u2019s back.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Zhu Jianing said in a volume that he did not realize had become a whisper.\u201cThis classroom, it\u2019s different from the rest.\u201d Fei Youliang stood at the door of the sealed classroom. Looking at the dark-colored uniforms that filled the chairs, he had a weird feeling that the classroom was filled with students.\u201cThere are all these uniforms.\u201d Zhu Jianing was even more scared than Fei Youliang; just a glance through the window was enough to make him shiver. \u201cShould we go to someplace else first?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDon\u2019t be scared. A worker at the Haunted House should be hiding inside this room, and that\u2019s why its decor is different from the others.\u201d Fei Youliang could still maintain his calmness. \u201cThe man said that we must experience the four scenarios, and this should be one of them. This is the selling point of the Haunted House; we have to record it and then solve it so that we can post it online.\u201dWhile he was talking, the door slowly opened on its own like being moved by an invisible hand.\u201cThere must be some kind of control mechanism. It\u2019s common equipment used in the shooting of scary movies.\u201d Fei Youliang slapped Zhu Jianing on his arm. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go catch some ghosts.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, but\u2026\u201d Zhu Jianing said with a head full of cold sweat, \u201cI\u2019ve taken a look around, and there\u2019re only school uniforms inside the room; there\u2019s no space for anyone to hide.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s probably some hidden compartment. Be careful. This means that the actor might come out to scare you from unexpected corners.\u201d Fei Youliang and Zhu Jianing dawdled outside the classroom for a long time before finally entering it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was a weird smell in the air. Entering the room was like going underwater; there was an inexplicable pressure pressing down on them, causing their breathing to become rather uneven.\u201cYouliang, should I wait for you outside?\u201d The classroom was darker than the corridor. Zhu Jianing, who stood behind Fei Youliang, had a frightened grimace on his face, and his forehead was covered with sweat.\u201cWhat did we promise each other before entering the Haunted House? We said we\u2019d never abandon each now, but now you\u2019re already giving up?\u201d Fei Youliang was getting increasingly agitated. The uniforms that littered the room were not unlike the props that were used in scary movies; for some reason, he felt apprehensive about going near them.Zhu Jianing did not notice that his teammate\u2019s confidence had been shattered. He whispered from behind him, \u201cWhere do you think the Haunted House\u2019s worker will be hiding? Will they jump up from underneath the uniforms?\u201d\u201cNot clear, but they would normally do something like that.\u201d Fei Youliang nudged his way to the lectern. He gripped his fists as he walked down the rows of tables, but nothing scary happened. \u201cIt does not seem like there\u2019s anyone hiding here.\u201d\u201cBut if there\u2019s no one hiding here, why waste so many resources to create such a large and detailed set? There is what looks like blood writing carved onto the tables, and these old uniforms were purposely left in the room.\u201d Zhu Jianing glanced behind him. \u201cFurthermore, the door opened on its own earlier like it was inviting us to come in.\u201d\u201cIt was probably the wind.\u201d Fei Youliang turned to glare at Zhu Jianing. \u201cIf you have to time to mumble this nonsense, come and help me look for the hidden mechanism or trick.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be mad, I\u2019m just helping you analyze the situation\u2026\u201d Zhu Jianing headed in the other direction of the room. Due to his large body, when he walked past one of tables, he accidentally knocked one of the uniforms to the floor. He did not mind it and did not seem intent on picking it up. He stepped on the uniform and continued to walk until he reached the classroom\u2019s backdoor. \u201cThere is indeed nothing worth getting scared over; I was expecting something to pounce at me when I passed the tables\u2026\u201dZhu Jianing\u2019s voice faded out. He turned and realized that the classroom had reverted to its original state.\u201cWhen I walked down the row, I remember knocking into one of the uniforms. Youliang, did you pick it up from the floor?\u201d\u201cA uniform that fell to the floor? How come I didn\u2019t notice it?\u201d Fei Youliang stood at the other end of the classroom, a distance of several tables away.\u201cWas I imagining it?\u201d Zhu Jianing walked back up the row. He stood beside the table that was situated at the center of the room. \u201cI remember it was this uniform that fell to the floor.\u201dHe picked the uniform up and waved it once. A weird odor drifted out from it. It smelled like rotten fish.\u201cThis is weird.\u201d Zhu Jianing dropped the uniform onto the table and squatted down to inspect the table and chair for hidden mechanisms. He shook the table, and everything seemed normal. Just as he was about to move on, the sound of marbles came from inside the drawer.\u201cThere\u2019s something inside?\u201d Zhu Jianing bent down and leaned into the mouth of the drawer. The dark drawer was stuffed with test papers and textbooks.\u201cWhy was there the sound of marbles? There\u2019s hidden compartment inside this drawer?\u201d He looked into the darkness and reached in to pull out the papers. He only pulled out the first one when he saw two round eyes staring right at him from behind the paper.\u201cF*ck!\u201d The sudden scare caused Zhu Jianing, who was half-squatted, to stumble back and knock the two tables behind him out of position.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong\u203d\u201d The commotion shocked Fei Youliang, who was also in the room.\u201cThere\u2019s someone inside the drawer!\u201d Zhu Jianing tried to crawl up from the floor, but his limbs failed him. His face was drained of blood.\u201cHave you lost your mind\u203d How can a person fit inside a drawer?\u201d Fei Youliang cursed as he went to help his teammate. \u201cIt\u2019s probably some kind of prop.\u201dHe pulled out the papers and textbooks from inside the drawer and dropped them onto the floor. \u201cTake a look. Don\u2019t be such a scaredy cat; there\u2019s nothing inside.\u201dAfter ten seconds to calm himself down, Zhu Jianing finally climbed up from the floor. \u201cBut I really saw a pair of eyes\u2026 I\u2019m not lying! I swear on my life!\u201d\u201cEven if that\u2019s true, it\u2019s just a trick of the Haunted House. Why are you so scared?\u201d Fei Youliang was not that scared to begin with, but what Zhu Jianing said did unsettle him a little. \u201cFine, let\u2019s leave this room for now.\u201dThe pair escaped in a hurry, leaving behind a trail of chaos.\u201cDo we need to continue?\u201d Zhu Jianing asked. Looking at the corridor that seemingly had no end, his heart was quivering.\u201cYou\u2019re giving up in less than five minutes? We\u2019re here to ruin this place, not to do promotion for this Haunted House.\u201d Fei Youliang had half a mind to kick Zhu Jianing. \u201cGet a hold of yourself! Why are you acting all scared like a little girl? How are you going to answer to your muscles?\u201dThen he continued to move forward. Even though Zhu Jianing was afraid, it would be worse to be abandoned or labelled a traitor of Qin Guang\u2019s studio, so he powered on.As he moved forward, he looked over his shoulder. When he saw the door to the sealed classroom slowly open again, he quickly caught up to Fei Youliang and hissed, \u201cLet\u2019s go, it feels like something is coming out from that classroom!\u201dThe pair ran forward in a hurry. They ignored the toilet and arrived at the first junction.\u201cJust how big is this set? There\u2019s even a choice of paths?\u201dZhu Jianing had completely given up, and Fei Youliang was frowning deeply. He loved scary movies and had visited many Haunted House in his life, but this was the first time he had encountered such a Haunted House. They had not seen any Haunted House workers in ghost costumes, but the feeling of fear refused to leave. The longer they remained, the stronger that feeling became.In the Haunted Houses that he visited in the past, he could still see the \u2018ghosts\u2019, and with the appearance of the \u2018ghosts\u2019, he would feel much better because all those \u2018ghosts\u2019 were actors hired by the Haunted House. It told him that the place was fake; it was all a human creation.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, the Haunted House he was in that day had completely upended his preconception of Haunted Houses. There were no actors so far, but it had managed to create an inexplicable feeling of suspenseful fear, like something incredibly scary might happen at any moment.\u201cLet\u2019s try this way.\u201dThe corridor narrowed as Fei Youliang and Zhu Jianing headed toward the female dormitory.The front few rooms were not scary, and their emotions slowly relaxed as the fear surrounding their hearts slowly disappeared. Then they entered the room with the Pen Spirit game.In the female bedroom that was preserved like a crime scene, four chairs stood side by side, and several pieces of white paper as well as a ballpoint pen that was glued together with tape sat on one of the chairs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The man seemed like he was about to run at any moment. \u201cIt has that Escape the Room feel. The clues to the exit are probably hidden here as well, right?\u201d\u201cNo idea, this is the first time I\u2019ve visited a Haunted House that gave its visitors such a great degree of freedom. The boss sure is confident that no accidents will happen to his customers.\u201d Fei Youliang walked to the chairs and picked up a random piece of white paper. On it, it was written \u201cWhen will I die? How will I die? Who will be the next to die?\u201d\u201cThis looks like the Pen Spirit game, but\u2026\u201d Fei Youliang turned to look at the ballpoint pen on the chair. \u201cIsn\u2019t this pen a bit too unconventional?\u201d\u201cDoes it contain some kind of hidden mechanism?\u201d Zhu Jianing also walked over to hold the pen in his palm. He pressed on it for several times and almost broke the pen. \u201cIt seems like a normal pen to me.\u201d\u201cDo you still remember what the Haunted House boss said before we came in?\u201d\u201cThere are four scenarios in the Haunted House, and we have to experience them all before we can get the clues to the exit.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The clues are hidden in the four small scenarios. Let\u2019s take a closer look around. In my experience, there\u2019s probably a key or paper note hidden inside this bedroom.\u201dThe bedroom was small, and the pair searched every corner but came up with nothing.\u201cThis Haunted House is not that easy to unlock, and the design are incredibly detailed.\u201d Fei Youliang placed the paper on the table. Three of them had writing on, but one was left blank. \u201cDoes this mean that we have to play the Pen Spirit game at least once before we can get the answer?\u201d\u201cPlaying the Pen Spirit game inside a Haunted House doesn\u2019t sound like a good idea.\u201d Zhu Jianing was flustered after reading the writing on the sheets of paper.\u201cOf the four scenarios, this one seems the simplest. If you don\u2019t want to do this, we\u2019ll need to go back to that classroom. Would you prefer that?\u201d Fei Youliang waved his hand impatiently. \u201cPlus, do you really think there is a Pen Spirit in this world? Get over here. We\u2019ll try it once, and if it doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019ll leave.\u201dFei Youliang felt something was off, and he felt weirdly uncomfortable, like something was grasping his heart. Zhu Youliang unwillingly walked toward Fei Youliang. They stood on opposite sides of the chairs.\u201cBut I don\u2019t know how the game works.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve seen many movies about the Pen Spirit. I\u2019ve even tried it out a few times at home. It\u2019s just a trick and can be scientifically explained.\u201d Fei Youliang straightened the pen and hovered it over the single paper that was empty. \u201cCross your fingers over mine and grab the pen tightly.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Zhu Jianing squatted down beside the chair and did what he was told. \u201cNow what?\u201d\u201cJust be quiet.\u201d Fei Youliang wrote down \u201cYES\u201d and \u201cNO\u201d on the white paper. When the bedroom became completely quiet, he started to chant, \u201cPen Spirit, Pen Spirit, you are my spirit from my previous life, and I am your spirit in this life. If you are with us, please draw a circle on the paper.\u201dAs he finished, a cold blast of wind suddenly shook the half-opened door of the bedroom. The dilapidated door slowly opened to reveal the empty and dim corridor. Zhu Jianing shivered and shrunk involuntarily into the room.\u201cStop moving.\u201d Fei Youliang stared at the sharp end of the pen, his body frozen like a statue. The chilling wind streamed through the bedroom. The paper on the floor fluttered like an invisible hand was flipping through them. The temperature dropped, and coldness seeped up from their ankles.When someone is asked to hold the same position under a highly stressful situation, one\u2019s senses would be heightened. This was not unlike a form of torture for the pair who was in the middle of the Pen Spirit game.The decrepit bedroom seemed to turn darker, and the dirtied bedsheet moved in the wind like something was crawling out from underneath the bed. Ten minutes later, the pair\u2019s hands, which hung in midair, started to tremble, and a series of dots started to appear on the paper.Zhu Jianing could not help but ask, \u201cHas the Pen Spirit arrived?\u201dHe could not withstand this kind of tense atmosphere.\u201cMany movies set the time for Pen Spirit to appear after ten minutes. If there\u2019s no reaction within ten minutes, it means that the game has failed, but this is a made-up rule. Often, people think that the Pen Spirit has arrived, but in reality, it is merely a psychological effect,\u201d Fei Youliang said to calm his teammate. \u201cThis place is one of the four scenarios mentioned by the boss. We\u2019ll try to follow his rules for now and see what kind of tricks he can play on us.\u201dAs he finished, the ballpoint pen in their hands moved. It was a slight movement, but both of them felt it.\u201cWas that you?\u201d both asked at the same time, and they managed to see the shock registered on the other person\u2019s face.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me,\u201d Zhu Jianing denied in a hurry. He had completely recovered from the fear brought on by the pair of eyes, and now this happened. He was in a highly tense state. \u201cYouliang, do you think the real Pen Spirit has arrived?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. The Pen Spirit game utilizes the game\u2019s format and the environment to create psychological pressure. The elongated time of maintaining a constant posture will cause the pen to appear like it has moved on its own even though it is actually the result of our bodies reacting to the environmental and physiological stimulus,\u201d Fei Youliang stated in a tone that sounded like he was persuading himself. \u201cOur subconscious imagines that the pen has moved, and it has influenced our conscious mind.\u201dHowever, as he finished, the pen moved again, and it was very obvious this time. The pair looked at each other before both turned toward the paper in unison. The little dots on the paper were connected by a line to form an irregular circle.\u201cF*ck! It\u2019s really here!\u201d Zhu Jianing\u2019s first reaction was to pull his hand back, but he was stopped by Fei Youliang.\u201cWhether or not it is the real Pen Spirit, we have to continue this game.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIf it is the real Pen Spirit, if we end the game without sending it off, we\u2019ll be cursed by the Spirit until we die; if it is fake, then there is no reason for us to be afraid, and everything is just a trick arranged by the boss to scare us.\u201d\u201cThen what shall we do next?\u201d\u201cTry to ask it some questions, and then send the Pen Spirit away,\u201d Fei Youliang said calmly.\u201cWhat kind of questions we should ask? Questions like the ones written on the other paper?\u201d Zhu Jianing pointed at the pieces of paper that littered the floor.\u201cThat is a trap. We must not ask the Pen Spirit questions that are related to death. Try to ask some random questions.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cRandom questions?\u201d\u201cYes, let me try.\u201d Fei Youliang gripped Zhu Jianing\u2019s hand tightly. After a pause, he shushed Zhu Jianing, and he muttered softly, \u201cPen Spirit, Pen Spirit, can you tell me the name of my future wife?\u201dTo Fei Youliang\u2019s surprise, when he finished the question, the wind inside the bedroom suddenly stopped blowing, and an insurmountable pressure started to expand from behind him.The pen in their hands quivered violently, and soon, three words appeared on the white paper.\u201cYOU WILL DIE!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had asked about his future wife\u2019s name, but why would such a curse come out? There was no connection between them. He made sure he had followed the rules of the Pen Spirit game closely; he did not do anything that should have angered the Pen Spirit.He thought about it, and an answer came to him.\u00a0This must be one of the preset designs. No matter what question I asked, these three words were destined to appear.Feeling like he had seen through the boss\u2019 trick, the confidence that Fei Youliang had lost earlier started to resurface.\u201cThe method to make these three words appear is interesting. Temporarily, I still don\u2019t understand it, but to amplify the fear factor, the boss has forgotten to take care of the situation\u2019s sense of logic,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf it were any other visitor, they probably would have ended the Pen Spirit game or done something taboo to anger the Pen Spirit in their panic, and the appearance of these three words would have heightened their internal suspicion, thinking that the Pen Spirit had really appeared and allowed themselves to be feared. Unfortunately, their visitors today are the two of us. We have made no mistakes along the way, but the answer on the paper still comes up as irrelevant to my question. Therefore, this Pen Spirit game is nothing more than a scary trick.\u201dEven after his long explanation, Fei Youliang realized that Zhu Jianing still had not responded, making him feel like he was talking to a wall.\u201cXiao Zhu? Why is your hand so cold?\u201d He raised his head and saw Zhu Jianing was staring dumbly at the space behind him, his mouth wide open and his features twisted in abject fear.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dThe expression on Zhu Jianing\u2019s face unsettled Fei Youliang. He did not seem to hear his teammate, and his whole body was shivering, just like the broken ballpoint pen they were holding. A bad feeling appeared in Fei Youliang\u2019s heart. He had also sensed that the atmosphere in the bedroom had changed. There was an indescribable presence that had joined them in the room, one that had not been there earlier, and it felt like it was just behind him.He wanted to turn to take a look, but something pressed down on his back, and every muscle in his body tensed. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What\u2019s behind this?\u201dVarious questions flashed across his mind, and the feeling of wanting to take a look but being afraid of what he might see made the man crazy.\u201cXiao Zhu, tell me, what are you seeing? What is behind me\u203d\u201dA chill soon spread through his body; it felt like he had been dropped into an icy cave. Fei Youliang shivered involuntarily, and various purplish bruises appeared on his skin, like many invisible hands were grabbing him.The thing behind him felt like it was trying to squeeze itself into his body, and the chilling presence pushing down on his shoulders became heavier and heavier!Opposite him, Zhu Jianing seemed to use every energy in his body to squeeze out a warning.\u201cThere\u2019s someone behind you!\u201d\u201cBehind me?\u201dThere were two explanations to this warning; either someone was literally on his back or someone was standing behind him. Fei Youliang\u2019s brain was churning when Zhu Jianing suddenly jumped up from the floor, shook Fei Youliang\u2019s hand off, and ran out the room!Zhu Jianing did not hesitate or even turn around once in his escape.Fei Youliang, who was abandoned, still sat dumbly on the floor. The ballpoint pen seemed to have stuck to his hand, and no matter how hard he tried to shake it loose, it simply would not come off. Suddenly, his arm froze like something had taken control of it. Then the pen started to move on its own to write on the white paper.\u201cYOU WILL DIE! YOU WILL DIE! YOU WILL DIE!\u201dThe series of blood red curses appeared on the white paper. Zhu Jianing had already left, and the one holding the pen was himself. He was certain that he did not move his hand, so this meant that these curses were written by something else in the room.Even at a time like that, Fei Youliang still managed to maintain his cool. He was an adrenaline junkie, and he did not believe in ghosts. He believed in the rationality and logic of science above all else.The thing that Xiao Zhu saw is probably some 3D imaging. Since the chairs are arranged in such a manner, it means that the position of the Pen Spirit game is constant. With the careful manipulation of angles, it would create an authentic looking effect. That should be the tactic employed there, but why would my body be shaking?He admitted that he had underestimated this broken ballpoint pen and the Haunted House in general. If given another chance, he would not have entered the Haunted House with so little preparation, and he definitely would have picked a better partner.The chill on his back continued to spread. As if depleted, the pen in Fei Youliang\u2019s palm finally collapsed and broke into pieces after it finished the crazy scrawls. When the pen left his palm, the last word it wrote was \u201cDIE\u201d.Is it over?\u00a0Fei Youliang felt his senses returning to his arm. It was then that he finally sighed in relief. His muscles were still rather frozen. He wanted to work some temperature into them, but he realized the pressure on his shoulders had not left, and he was still unable to move!He had thought he had survived the Pen Spirit game, but the real experience had just started.Why can\u2019t I move still?\u00a0Fei Youliang creaked his neck inch by inch to look over his shoulder. His eyes were narrowed into slits, and he was fully prepared, but when he turned, he saw there was nothing behind him.It was all for naught? But then why would Xiao Zhu react in such a crazy manner? What did he actually see?Fei Youliang\u2019s mind churned hastily, and the pressure on his shoulders increased like someone was stepping on them.Shoulders? Stepping on them?An image flashed through his mind, and Fei Youliang slowly raised his head.Raven-black hair falling all over her head, her face bloated from asphyxiation, the eyes popping out of her pockets, anger rimming the edges.There was a hanging woman standing on Fei Youliang\u2019s shoulders!His lips fell open, but no sound came out. Every hair on his body stood upright, and his glasses slowly slid off his face. Fei Youliang felt as if his heart had stopped at that moment.\u201cI\u2026\u201dBefore finishing the sentence, the focus in his eyes started to lax, and his body collapsed weakly toward the floor.\u2026Chen Ge waited for a few minutes before entering Mu Yang High School\u2019s scenario. He did not want to enter too soon after the two previous visitors.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euI haven\u2019t heard any screams for so long\u2026 looks like I underestimated those two.After putting on the skin mask, Chen Ge\u2019s first destination was the Sealed Classroom. He placed the paper box with the twenty-four name tags on the lectern.\u00a0The tables and chairs have been moved. They have been here and probably stumbled across something.What that something was, Chen Ge had no clue. After all, even he had not fully understood the secret of this sealed classroom yet.After putting the tables and chairs back into position, and the papers and textbooks back into the drawer, Chen Ge suddenly heard footsteps coming from the junction not far ahead. Someone was running through the corridor.Who could that be?\u00a0He put on the bloodied coat and the mask made from multiple human faces and slowly slipped out of the classroom.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When Chen Ge exited the classroom, he saw the person responsible for it. The 1.8-meter-tall Zhu Jianing rushed out of the female dormitory, screaming for dear life. His face was blanched, and he raced down the corridor like a mad bull.What\u2019s going on? Based on his running direction, he probably ran into something scary inside the female dormitory, but there\u2019s nothing scary inside the female bedrooms.\u00a0Zhu Jianing was already scared out of his mind before Chen Ge even did anything. This gave Chen Ge a sense of helplessness.Didn\u2019t they say they\u2019re not afraid of anything? Weren\u2019t they very calm when they entered the scenario? Why is he running amok like a rabid dog now?\u00a0Chen Ge also did not know what encounter they had experienced in the newly unlocked scenario. For the sake of safety, he decided to intercept Zhu Jianing to ask him for details.Zhu Jianing, who had raced out of the female bedroom, did not even have a chance to catch his breath before he saw a shadow moving inside the sealed classroom!The school uniform has come alive\u203d\u00a0The thought appeared in his mind immediately. He was racing so fast that he did not have the momentum to stop himself. When he reached the classroom door, he saw a bloody shadow slide out from the classroom. Time slowed for Zhu Jianing. His gaze fell on the person\u2019s face; it was a face sewn together by many different faces, and every single one of them captured emotions of fear, terror, and pain.I knew the classroom was not safe!\u00a0Unable to stop himself, Zhu Jianing rammed directly into the wall of the corridor. Ignoring the pain that shot through his body, he pushed himself off the wall and turned to run!The combination of pain and fear had muddled his mind. Without seeing where he was going, Zhu Jianing saw the first exit and he rushed into it. When he entered, he realized it was the corner toilet.Why would he trap himself?\u00a0Chen Ge was becoming more and more curious about what exactly this man stumbled across in the female bedroom.\u00a0Also, why is he alone? Where is his friend?After giving it some thought, Chen Ge thought it was best if he could get the answer directly from the man. He touched the skin mask on his face before entering the toilet. It was not until he was inside the toilet that Zhu Jianing realized he had taken the wrong turn, but there was nothing else he could do. He yanked open a random cubicle, which was the fourth one and hid inside it.He clamped his palm over his mouth and squeezed his muscular body to fit beside the toilet, his heart racing and his pupils darting about nervously. Zhu Jianing was really scared out of his mind. When they were playing the Pen Spirit game, he had sat across from Fei Youliang, and while his friend was busy analyzing, he had seen the Pen Spirit slowly appear behind Fei Youliang. When the woman\u2019s bloated face appeared in his mind, he also felt like the air was getting sucked out of his lungs.That wasn\u2019t an actor! This Haunted House is really haunted!\u00a0They had searched the bedroom, including under the bed, before starting the game. They were sure there was no one hiding inside the room; that poor woman had appeared out of thin air!It has to be a ghost!\u00a0The woman\u2019s face refused to leave Zhu Jianing\u2019s mind. Even when he closed his eyes, the woman could be seen swaying from the hanging rope. He felt extremely helpless as he leaned against the wall. He felt weirdly exposed.Youliang is still inside the room. The ghost was standing on his shoulders. A scene like that wouldn\u2019t appear in real life, would it?\u00a0Zhu Jianing took several deep breaths. He felt like he was going light-headed from a lack of oxygen.I need to contact the people outside; this Haunted House is problematic.\u00a0He tried to tell himself not to be afraid, but his muscular arms kept shivering. He rummaged in his backpack for a long time before he found his phone.\u201cXiao Zhu? Why are you calling me? Are you guys done with the video?\u201d The squat middle-aged man\u2019s voice came from the other end.\u201cBrother Yuan, please come in to help me! There are actual ghosts inside this Haunted House!\u201d Zhu Jianing\u2019s voice was trembled with tears. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long much longer I can hold on. There are god knows how many ghosts looking for me.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it normal for Haunted House to have ghosts?\u201d The middle-aged man thought Zhu Jianing was joking.\u201cNot ghosts played by actors but actual ghosts!\u201d Zhu Jianing hissed urgently. He did not dare raise his voice lest the \u2018ghosts\u2019 outside heard him.The middle-aged man finally noticed the seriousness in Zhu Jianing\u2019s voice. \u201cGive the phone to Youliang, let me talk to him.\u201d\u201cBrother Liang was possessed by the ghost; he is still trapped inside that cursed bedroom.\u201d\u201cPossessed?\u201d\u201cI saw it with my own eyes; the ghost was standing on his shoulders. It was a hanging ghost, the face was purplish white, and her eyes were popping out from their sockets!\u201d\u201cStanding on his shoulders? You guys were assaulted by the workers? Okay! We\u2019re going in now!\u201d\u201cNot the workers, it\u2019s real ghost; there are no worker inside this Haunted House\u2026\u201d Before Zhu Jianing could finish, footsteps came from the toilet entrance. \u201cHas the ghost entered\u203d\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? Hello?\u201d The middle-aged man\u2019s voice came from the phone. Afraid that it might catch the ghost\u2019s attention, Zhu Jianing quickly ended the call.Hopefully, it doesn\u2019t hear me. Please don\u2019t let it discover me, and I won\u2019t ever visit this place again.\u00a0Zhu Jianing turned off the phone, bent down, and stared straight at the wooden door of the cubicle.He did not know when the door before him would be pulled open, and he did not know what might be beyond the door. Various scary images filled his mind like the scary woman\u2019s face appearing behind the door or a school uniform fluttering on its own into his cubicle.What should I do? Brother Yuan, please come soon!\u00a0he prayed to himself. The sound of footsteps came closer and closer!CREAK\u2026The door to the first cubicle was pushed open. The old wooden door creaked audibly, and it caused Zhu Jianing to hold his breath in fear. After a small pause, the second cubicle door was pushed open.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt\u2019s getting closer!\u00a0After another long pause, as he expected, the third door was pushed open.It\u2019s right next to me! It\u2019ll open this door soon!\u00a0The muscles all over Zhu Jianing\u2019s body tensed. Fear and terror were tormenting his sanity. Time trickled by, but weirdly enough, no one opened the door to his cubicle. He waited for half a minute, and the door to his cubicle was still unmoved.It left?\u00a0He gathered all his courage to pull open the door a sliver. There was nothing outside.\u00a0It really left?He pushed the door slowly open, and there was really no one outside.\u00a0That was lucky. I was almost discovered.After sighing in relief, Zhu Jianing called the middle-aged man\u2019s number again. As the light shone on his phone, he saw something reflected on the phone display. He looked behind him, and on top of the door of the third cubicle, a disjointed face was silently looking at him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A voice could still be heard on the other end.\u201cYouliang\u2019s phone is not reachable. What happened to you guys in there?\u201cXiao Zhu? Can you hear me?\u201cZhu Jianing? Are you alright? Talk to me?\u201dOf course, Zhu Jianing could hear him, but at that moment, he had lost the power of speech. His pupils rolled back, and Zhu Jianing slithered to the floor like wet laundry.\u201cDidn\u2019t I warn you not to take pictures and videos inside the Haunted House? Why didn\u2019t you listen?\u201d Chen Ge removed his mask and placed it inside his pocket. He glanced at Zhu Jianing, who was convulsing on the floor, and he had a renewed appreciation for the disclaimer agreement.His scare tactics were different from other Haunted Houses. Normal Haunted Houses had actors pretend to be ghosts who hid in the blind corner to scare the visitors with sudden screams and shouts. Chen Ge\u2019s tactic was different. His focus was on the creation of the atmosphere, and he allowed the visitors to walk into the scare on their own. The whole process was fool-proof and could not be detected earlier.Even when the visitors were already prepared, they would still be scared\u2014 Zhu Jianing was the perfect example. The fear inside his heart which had no place to release was like an ice cube lodged in his throat, stopping his breath and chilling his bones.Chen Ge exited the third cubicle, picked up the phone, and slid it inside Zhu Jianing\u2019s pocket before dragging the man out of the toilet and depositing him in the corridor.Why haven\u2019t the spasms stopped? But he\u2019s still breathing, so he should be fine.\u00a0Chen Gen applied pressure to the man\u2019s temples, and when Zhu Jianing\u2019s pupils regained focus, he said, \u201cCan you hear me? Where is your friend who came in with you?\u201dThere was no answer, so Chen Ge had to give up on the man. \u201cStay put, or else you might run into an actual ghost.\u201dHe was afraid that he might scare the other person dumb as well, so Chen Ge removed his bloodied outfit and carried it in his arm.This man came running out from the female dormitory, so his friend should be there.Chen Ge ran toward the dormitory, but even after he searched through all the bedrooms, he could not find Fei Youliang.Where did he go?\u00a0He stopped at the room with the Pen Spirit. The pen that he had fixed with tape was broken once more and was lying on the floor.There is no sign of fighting in the room, so where could the bespectacled man have gone?\u00a0Chen Ge exited the female dormitory and reached the junction.\u00a0Could he have gone down the other way?The other route led to the deep well and school office. The road was uneven, and after passing several offices, Chen Ge finally found Fei Youliang. The man\u2019s condition was even worse than Zhu Jianing\u2019s. There was white foam around his lips, and his glasses were shattered. However, the most curious thing was that he was lying near the well at the end of the corridor with one of his hands holding the edge of the well like he was going to haul himself into it.What in the world happened to this guy? Looks like he has angered more than just the Pen Spirit!\u00a0There was no surveillance in this new scenario, so Chen Ge had no idea what had happened to Fei Youliang.Looking at the man\u2019s worse for wear condition, Chen Ge very kindly checked his pulse.The man\u2019s condition is very similar to He San\u2019s when he first visited the Haunted House. I\u2019d better get him out of here first.After wasting plenty of energy, Chen Ge finally managed to drag the two to the scenario entrance. Prying open the wooden boards, he just finished dragging the two onto the first floor when he heard the sound of an argument coming from outside the Haunted House; it sounded like the people from Qin Guang\u2019s studio were attempting to barge into the Haunted House.So much trouble today.\u00a0With one arm under each visitor, he dragged the two out of the Haunted House. Chen Ge dropped Fei Youliang and Zhu Jianing before the people from Qin Guang\u2019s studio. His eyes scanned the lot of them as he demanded, \u201cWhat is the commotion about?\u201dTwo lively, vibrant men had walked into the Haunted House, and two lifeless husks had come out. One of them was even foaming at the mouth. Did he get scared until he vomited?The surrounding crowd immediately took a step back to clear a space for them.\u201cXiao Zhu! Youliang!\u201d The people from Qin Guang\u2019s studio immediately rushed over to help them off the ground. Zhu Jianing was recovering; he now responded to others at least, but his legs were still weak.The serious case was Fei Youliang. He was not unconscious, because his eyes were wide open, but he did not respond to people calling his name. His expression was blank, and the white foam continued to trail out of the corner of his lips.\u201cWhat have you done to the both of them\u203d\u201d the middle-aged man demanded angrily.\u201cWhy would you ask me? How would I know?\u201d Chen Ge was being honest. When he entered the scenario, the two were already in such a state.\u201cWe talked to each other earlier. Xiao Zhu said that your employees stepped on Youliang\u2019s shoulders! How dare you allow your workers to assault the visitors? We are definitely going to sue!\u201d\u201cWho saw my employees assault him?\u201d Chen Ge glanced at the two lying on the floor. \u201cFeel free to call the police. I can guarantee, other than their own hands, you won\u2019t be able to find foreign fingerprints on the rest of their bodies.\u201d\u201cStop arguing, I\u2019ll call the park\u2019s doctor. The most important thing now is to help them.\u201d This was such a headache for Uncle Xu.\u201cThey\u2019re in this state, and you still refuse to admit your fault? Thankfully, we came prepared!\u201d The middle-aged man opened Fei Youliang\u2019s backpack and pulled out the laptop from within. Then he connected the wireless camera from Fei Youliang\u2019s chest and the audio recorder attached to the backpack to the laptop.\u201cIndeed, you people sure came prepared.\u201d When Chen Ge was dragging the \u2018bodies\u2019 out of the Haunted House earlier, he had already noticed the cameras and could guess the real motive behind why they were there. However, he did not mind it one bit. Other Haunted Houses banned recording was because they were afraid that their set designs would be leaked; after all, designing a set was incredibly pricey. However, that was not a concern for Chen Ge. He would be given new scenarios after completing Trial Missions. In terms of the updating speed for new scenarios, no Haunted House could rival Chen Ge.From his perspective, the videos collected by these guys were a type of alternative advertisement; after all, what his Haunted House was missing most was exposure.\u201cYou won\u2019t be so smug in a bit. I will keep the video of your employees physically assaulting the visitors as evidence!\u201d the middle-aged man said loudly like he was trying to get the attention of the passing crowd.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWe are absolute professionals; we didn\u2019t not lay a finger on your people. How many times do you want me to repeat that?\u201d Chen Ge asked as he wandered over to the laptop. He, too, was actually curious about what happened to Fei Youliang inside the Haunted House and why he ended up next to the well.The middle-aged man straightened the laptop and played the recorded video. The screen was dark, and only random noises could be heard. At the time, Fei Youliang had not entered the Haunted House. The recorder had probably been activated beforehand. The camera had not been taken out yet, so they could only hear noises but could see no image.Several seconds later, Chen Ge\u2019s voice could be heard from the computer.\u201cLet me remind you, the last person who made a claim like yours came out on his back.\u201dThen Fei Youliang\u2019s condescending laugh followed. \u201cYou\u2019ve only managed to arouse my interest even more.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
