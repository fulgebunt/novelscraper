Your brothers are all hungry.\u201d A sharp voice came from outside, impatient.\u201cNo, no more firewood.\u201d A weak voice came from a dilapidated thatched hut. From the curling smoke, it could be seen that this was a kitchen.\u201cNo firewood? If you don\u2019t have firewood, you won\u2019t pick it up. Are you trying to starve your younger brother to death? You really are a loser. What else can you do except know how to eat?\u201d The previous voice became more and more sharp and ruthless. cursed.The child who was in front of the stove couldn\u2019t help but flinched, fear flashed across his eyes.Stoves in farmhouses are generally built higher, which further accentuates the thinness of the child. His complexion is unhealthy waxy yellow, and his body is so thin that he will fall if the wind blows. He is 16 years old, but he still looks like a child. Children of eleven or twelve years old.A middle-aged man in a rough coat came in and yelled at the boy in front of the stove: \u201cYou lose money, at least others can marry and earn dowry money, but I can only lose money for raising you. You can\u2019t even give birth to a fart, who would want you, and now you can\u2019t even take care of your younger brothers, what\u2019s the point of you being alive?\u201dThe boy flinched again, and said weakly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Dad, I, I\u2019m going to pick up firewood right now.\u201d\u201cHurry up, if you starve your brother, see if I don\u2019t beat you to death!\u201d The middle-aged man said again viciously.The boy immediately put on a backpack that was even bigger than him, and left the house in a hurry, heading towards the back of the mountain.The boy couldn\u2019t help reaching out to touch his stomach, and quietly opened a corner where no one noticed, revealing a gray imprint of a flower, with a somewhat depressed expression.The place where the boy lives is a place where there are only brothers and men. Brothers bear the fertility. When each brother is born, there is a flower imprint above the navel. This is the symbol of being a brother. The flower imprint is more and more The brighter the color, the stronger the fertility.The boy\u2019s flowers are very dark, which means that his fertility is very low, and he may even be unable to have his own child for a lifetime. This was doomed when he was just born, and everyone in the village knew it. Therefore, the boy did not live until he was 16 years old. But still no one came to propose marriage.The boy quickly sorted out his thoughts and cheered himself up. Even if no one marries him now, he will definitely meet a man who will like him in the future, and he will take good care of him when the time comes. He, and he lived hard, and then gave birth to a cute baby who is white and chubby.The boy kept encouraging himself in his heart, his heart was full of longing for the future, and then he walked quickly towards the back mountain.From the village to the back mountain, there will be a field. Looking at the green wheat seedlings emerging from the field, the boy\u2019s eyes are full of envy, because in his heart, besides wanting to marry a man who loves him, the other biggest wish is to have A field of his own.In this way, he can plant his favorite crops in the field, and then take good care of them. When the autumn harvest comes, the family will have surplus food, and he doesn\u2019t have to be hungry every day.At that time, he will definitely make delicious food for the men who go out to work every day, and then take good care of their babies, and live a peaceful and warm little life.Thinking of this, a small smile appeared on the boy\u2019s face, obviously very satisfied and yearning for such a life.However, the most important thing now is to gather firewood and go home quickly, otherwise it will be too late, the younger brothers will make trouble again, and my father will scold him.The boy speeded up and walked proficiently on the mountain road. Obviously, he usually came here often, but usually only at the foot of the mountain. After all, the mountain is still too dangerous for a brother, even if he is a man, he has to go with him.The boy came to the place where he used to collect firewood, and carefully put all the firewood that could be used into the back basket, probably because he came here more often, and there was not much firewood that could be used here.The boy looked at the road up the mountain and was a little hesitant, but when he thought that if he brought back enough firewood, his father would definitely beat him, and then he might not even have food to eat, when he thought of the feeling of hunger , the boy decided to walk up, as long as he picked up enough, he would come back, and if he didn\u2019t go too deep, there should be no danger.While cheering himself up in his heart, the boy walked up the mountain, and carefully searched for the firewood that could be used along the way. Before he knew it, he had walked a long distance, but the boy didn\u2019t notice it.\u201cHoo hoo\u2026 finally full, this should be enough.\u201d The boy looked at the full basket of firewood, and a small satisfied smile appeared on his face.Then he bent down, trying to carry the whole basket of firewood on his back, but the weight of the whole basket of firewood had caught up with the boy\u2019s weight, and it was very difficult for the boy to walk with his back on his back, bending his waist with every step Yes, the bottom of the basket is worn on the ground, so it is more like dragging it than carrying it on its back.However, no matter how hard or tired the boy was, the boy didn\u2019t complain. Instead, he was worried that his younger brothers would be hungry and he would be beaten and scolded by his father when he returned home late. So he accelerated his speed again, but he didn\u2019t expect his foot to slip. The heavy firewood on his back made him unable to stabilize his body immediately, and the whole person fell over with the firewood.The moment the boy slid down the hill, what he thought about in his mind was not his own safety, but the scattered firewood. When he turned back and climbed up, he hoped that others would not pick him up, otherwise he would definitely be scolded again when he went back.However, what the boy didn\u2019t know was that there was a cliff at the bottom of the hill, and he had no chance to climb it.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

It hurts so much\u2026He still remembers being scolded by his father, and then he went up the mountain to collect firewood and went home to cook, but accidentally slipped and fell down.By the way, he slipped and fell, sharp branches and weeds were everywhere on the small slope, his body was scratched very painfully, and all his firewood was scattered.Firewood? For his firewood, he has to get up quickly to get the firewood back, otherwise if he doesn\u2019t go back, Dad will definitely beat him again.Mu Yan suddenly became excited, his hands and feet moved slightly, as if he was struggling to sit up.\u201cBig brother moved, big brother must have had a nightmare.\u201d A little boy about three or four years old who was staying beside the bed saw that Mu Yan lying on the bed hadn\u2019t opened his eyes, but his hands and feet moved. Next to him is a little girl who looks very similar to him.\u201cHow do you know that big brother is having a nightmare?\u201d Another childish voice sounded, clear and crisp.\u201cBecause you used to be like this when you had nightmares.\u201d The little boy replied with a serious nod.\u201cOh, then I\u2019ll call mom over.\u201d The little girl said after a while, then got off the bed and ran out.\u201cMom, mom, big brother is having a nightmare.\u201d The little girl called out from the yard.Soon, a slightly younger woman came in after the little girl, and was relieved to see that the person on the bed had moved.\u201cOh, don\u2019t move, you are still injured.\u201d The woman walked over, said in a soft voice, and helped Mu Yan tuck the quilt on her body.Such a nice voice, so gentle.Probably because the woman\u2019s gentle comfort had an effect, Mu Yan did not struggle, but slowly opened his eyes.\u201cMom, big brother is awake.\u201d The little girl clutched the corner of the young woman\u2019s clothes tightly with her small hand, and looked at the person lying on the bed with big eyes.Mu Yan looked at the strange people in the strange environment around him, feeling a little confused.\u201cIt\u2019s fine when you wake up. The doctor said that the injuries on your body are all superficial, and you just need to cultivate well.\u201d Lin Jiayu said, \u201cIt was Ayao who met you in the forest outside. The forest outside is very dangerous. How did you get there?\u201dMu Yan is still a little dazed until now, not sure what\u2019s going on, when he opened his eyes, everything around him changed, very strange, the person in front of him looked a little strange, with two more chest A piece of meat, is it because of illness? .He had never seen such a person before, but it was undeniable that the person in front of him was good-looking and had a nice voice.Could it be that he was rescued by people from the village below the cliff?At first, he thought that what he slid down was a small hill, and he wanted to climb up to pick up the firewood, but he didn\u2019t expect that the bottom of the hill was connected to a cliff, so he fell all the way down the slope. Below the cliff.That cliff was very high. At that time, he thought he would die, and his heart was full of regrets.He hadn\u2019t married yet, hadn\u2019t given birth to a lovely baby, and hadn\u2019t owned his own land yet, so he died just like that. He hoped that he could work hard in his next life to realize these wishes.I didn\u2019t expect God to take care of him, he fell from such a high cliff and didn\u2019t die, it\u2019s really great.Seeing that Mu Yan just stared blankly at her and didn\u2019t speak, Lin Jiayu thought that Mu Yan was frightened, so she spoke even more softly.\u201cAre you hungry? Eat something first and rest more, so that your injuries will heal faster.\u201d Lin Jiayu said with a smile, then took a bowl from the side and handed it to Mu Yan.Mu Yan took the bowl, which was soaked into a thick batter, his eyes lit up suddenly, and he drank it in big gulps, he was really hungry.Since he went out to collect firewood, he hadn\u2019t eaten anything. Up to now, his chest was already on his back, but because this kind of situation was very common in the past, he didn\u2019t complain that he was hungry.After all, according to past experience, every time he called hungry, not only would he not have food, but he would also be beaten and scolded.From then on, Mu Yan learned to endure hunger until Father and Father remembered.If Dad and Father couldn\u2019t remember it all the time, he would go to the back mountain to find some wild fruits and vegetables to satisfy his hunger.Although the taste of this bowl of batter is not very good, compared to drinking rice soup with almost no rice grains at home, the thick batter is simply delicious.However, after drinking, Mu Yan felt embarrassed, and his whole face turned red.\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry, I drank all of it.\u201d Mu Yan said nervously, looking at the empty bowl, he suddenly became nervous and at a loss.At home, the rice in the rice soup is for his younger brother. He can only drink soup, and the pancakes made of white flour can only be eaten by his father and younger brother. He can hardly drink this kind of thick batter at home. If Dad knows that he has eaten so many good things, he will definitely beat him severely.He was too hungry just now, and he ate it all without paying attention. Someone kindly saved him and gave him something to eat, but he didn\u2019t care whether he ate it or not, so he ate it all up. How could he be so bad.Seeing the emaciated Muyan\u2019s embarrassed expression, Lin Jiayu felt distressed.The planet they are on is the most backward and impoverished planet in the Federation. There is no high-tech, no interstellar network, and life continues in the way of the ancestral star era. All they can eat here are such tasteless nutrients and nutritional powders, which are barely enough. Feed.However, it was such a thing that other planets would dismiss. The boy in front of him felt embarrassed because he had eaten all of it. One can imagine what kind of life he lived before.Since Lin Jiayu gave birth to two children and became a mother, she loves her children very much, especially for such a thin and weak child who seems to be living a bad life very much.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, we still have a lot. If you\u2019re not full, I\u2019ll make another bowl for you.\u201d Lin Jiayu made her expression look more gentle and kind.Mu Yan hurriedly shook his head and said, \u201cThank you, no, no need.\u201dHe felt very happy to be able to eat a bowl, so how could he continue to ask for it greedily.\u201cThen you are sleeping for a while, the doctor said, you need to rest more to recover sooner.\u201d Lin Jiayu tucked Mu Yan into the quilt and said.The shock of falling off the cliff and the injuries on his body made Mu Yan lose energy, and soon fell asleep again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Standing together, the two look like a man and a woman, and they are very suitable.And the relationship between the two is also very good, which is enviable.\u201cDaddy, Daddy\u2026\u201d the little girl ran out of the house in a hurry when she heard her daddy\u2019s voice, her short legs were bouncing around, she was really cute.\u201cIs Yingying obedient at home today?\u201d Yang Wenyao picked up his daughter and gave her a \u201cboo\u201d on her tender little face, causing Yang Yingying to giggle.\u201cYingying is very good, she listens to her mother very much, and looks at her big brother.\u201d Yang Yingying smiled and told her father what she had done that day.The family of three outside was very happy to communicate. Yang Yinghao looked at his parents and sister outside, and looked at Mu Yan who was still lying on the bed. There was a trace of confusion on his little face.He also wanted to go out and talk to his father, let him hug him, but his mother asked him to take good care of his big brother, what if he woke up when he went out?He is a very trustworthy little man, how could he not count his words, so even though Yang Yinghao envied his younger sister who went out, he still sat quietly in the room, looking after Mu Yan who was still sleeping.Hearing cheerful voices from outside, Mu Yan slowly woke up from his deep sleep, his eyes still had the haze of just waking up.Seeing this, Yang Yinghao immediately got out of bed and ran out cheerfully, \u201cDad, Mom, big brother is awake.\u201dYang Wenyao hugged Yang Yingying and walked into the room with Lin Jiayu.When Mu Yan saw Yang Wenyao walking in, his face slowly turned red, and he didn\u2019t dare to look at him.As a brother, a brother who grew up in the village, surrounded by some rough guys, this is the first time he has seen such a handsome man, the breath of a full man rushing towards his face made his heart beat a little faster , the face is hot.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Yang Wenyao asked.The little boy immediately lowered his head when he saw him just now. He shouldn\u2019t look so scary, right? Yang Wenyao touched his face, thinking a little depressed.\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay, thank you for saving me.\u201d Mu Yan tried hard to adjust his emotions, not to let himself be too nervous.\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of raising your hand, but you, why would you go into the forest alone, you know there are many ferocious beasts there.\u201d Yang Wenyao said.At that time, he went to the forest to hunt a cloud-horned deer, and used the deerskin to make a pair of moccasins for Xiaoyu and Yingying. It is hard to imagine whether a person who was unconscious in the forest could survive.\u201cI, I fell down accidentally.\u201d Mu Yan said in a soft voice.Yang Wenyao with sharp ears still heard it, did it fall? Did he fall unconscious from a tree? That makes sense.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Yang Wenyao asked.\u201cI, my name is Mu Yan.\u201d Mu Yan replied.\u201cMuyan? It\u2019s a good name.\u201d Lin Jiayu praised.Mu Yan was a little embarrassed, \u201cThank you, thank you.\u201d\u201cMy name is Lin Jiayu. You can just call me Aunt Lin. His name is Yang Wenyao. You can call him Uncle Ayao or Uncle Yang. These are our children, Haohao and Yingying.\u201d Lin Jiayu told Mu Yan introduce themselves.\u201cBig brother, I\u2019m Yingying, and my name is Yang Yingying.\u201d Yingying introduced herself with a smile, she likes this big brother very much.\u201cMy name is Haohao, Yang Yinghao.\u201d Haohao\u2019s introduction was much shorter. It can be seen that although Yang Yinghao and Yang Yingying are twins, and the birth time is not much different, their personalities are quite different.Although Yang Yinghao is only three years old, he looks like a little adult, and he always tries hard to learn to be calm like an adult, while Yang Yingying is more lively and cheerful, with the innocence that a child of this age should have.\u201cAunt Lin, Uncle Yang, Haohao, Yingying.\u201d Mu Yan called out one by one obediently.\u201cAunt Lin, Uncle Yang, where are you, where are you?\u201d Mu Yan asked, he still has to go home, and the firewood, the younger brothers are still waiting for him to go back to cook, otherwise Dad will definitely scold him again him.\u201cThis is Peach Blossom Village.\u201d Lin Jiayu said, \u201cOur place is rich in a very beautiful pink flower. It is said that the peach blossoms in ancient times were pink and very beautiful, so our place is called Peach Blossom Village.\u201dPeach Blossom Village? Mu Yan searched in his mind, but there was no information about Peach Blossom Village, maybe it was a village under the cliff.\u201cWhere is your home? I\u2019ll send someone to notify your family.\u201d Yang Wenyao asked.\u201cI, my family is in Mujia Village.\u201d Mu Yan replied.\u201cMu\u2019s Village? There is no such village nearby, Xiaoyu, do you know where Mu\u2019s Village is?\u201d Yang Wenyao asked Lin Jiayu beside him. Lin Jiayu knew these things better than him.However, Lin Jiayu shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of this village.\u201dAlthough she can\u2019t remember the names of all the villages and towns on the entire planet, there is absolutely no problem in the nearby ones, but obviously there is no Mujiacun.\u201cMy, my family\u2019s village is on the other side of the mountain and the cliff, and I fell off the cliff.\u201d Mu Yan explained stutteringly.\u201cA cliff? But there is no cliff near here.\u201d Lin Jiayu asked suspiciously.No cliffs? How could there be no cliffs? Mu Yan was even more confused, but he just fell off the cliff.\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this for now. I\u2019ll ask someone to help you inquire about it. You still have injuries on your body and you need to recuperate.\u201d Yang Wenyao changed the subject, and Lin Jiayu comprehended to brew a bowl of nutritional powder paste and served it. come over.Although the young man\u2019s words were a bit strange, Yang Wenyao, who had seen countless people, could tell at a glance that this young man was innocent, just like other children in this village, very simple and honest, he would not be a bad person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was the first time he noticed these things. Although he woke up yesterday and saw them, he was just awake at that time, and he was not awake for a long time. He focused on nutrition. On the body of the person who saved him, he didn\u2019t pay attention to the surrounding environment.Everything here is very strange to him, he has never seen such a room, but I have to say that this place is much better than the place he used to live, the bed is soft and comfortable, and the room is better than before It is big, clean, and comfortable to live in. It can be seen that the family that saved him should be relatively rich.A rich family like this should have more work, he can\u2019t just lie down like this, he must do more work later to repay his life-saving grace, as for going home\u2026When Mu Yan thinks about the things he will face when he returns home, he feels a little depressed. He hasn\u2019t been home for a day, and his father must be very angry. The younger brothers must be hungry and crying, and his father and father will definitely beat him. Suddenly.\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d When Lin Jiayu came in with the nutrition paste soaked in nutrition powder, she found Mu Yan sitting on the bed in a daze.Pulled back from his wandering thoughts, Mu Yan said somewhat cautiously: \u201cAunt Lin, I can do a lot of work, and I can help you with it.\u201dAunt Lin\u2019s family saved him, so he couldn\u2019t just leave without doing anything, at least during the time when he found his way home, he must help Aunt Lin with some work, which can be regarded as a way of expressing his gratitude.\u201cYou are still very weak and need a good rest.\u201d Lin Jiayu said, not taking the other party\u2019s words that he knew how to work to heart.The other party looks like a ten-year-old child. There is no place for such a minor to be hired in the Federation, even on a poor planet.Lin Jiayu handed Mu Yan the nutrient paste in his hand, and Mu Yan hesitated seeing the same food as yesterday.Although the family seems to be very rich, but Aunt Lin and Yingying are both sick, it must cost a lot, and he can\u2019t always eat so many good things from them for no reason, especially when they saved him But he can\u2019t even do anything that can be repaid, which makes him very uneasy.\u201cAunt Lin, I can\u2019t eat any more of this white batter, just give me some rice soup.\u201d Mu Yan said weakly.\u201cRice soup?\u201d Lin Jiayu was a little taken aback when he heard Mu Yan\u2019s words, \u201cWhat is rice soup?\u201dWhen Mu Yan heard the words, his eyes flashed with puzzlement, but he still explained, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just rice that makes soup. You don\u2019t need to put a lot of rice, just a little bit is fine.\u201d\u201cIs rice edible? We don\u2019t have it here, I only have nutritional powder.\u201d Lin Jiayu said, she had never heard of rice before, isn\u2019t it only nutritional powder, nutritional supplements and Bigu Dan that can be eaten?The planet they live in is relatively poor and backward, and not many people can buy Bigu Dan, so they can only eat the paste made from this tasteless nutritional powder, but she has never heard of rice.\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Mu Yan heard the words, thinking that the other party\u2019s house was out of rice, and hurriedly apologized for his willful request.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, drink this first, it\u2019s good for your body.\u201dMu Yan took the nutritious food, and secretly thought that he must do more work to repay Aunt Lin for his kindness. Although the time to go home will be delayed, he also knows that even if it is not delayed, the things he will face when he goes back are the same , and even if it is delayed, the family members probably won\u2019t worry about him.Forget it, let\u2019s recuperate well here first, and then repay this kind person, what will happen when we go home, let\u2019s talk about it later, Mu Yan comforted himself silently in his heart.At this time, Mu Yan probably didn\u2019t know that he would never be able to return to that cold home.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This kind of strangeness was not only because of the strange people in a strange environment, but also because everything around him was completely different from what he had used before. , as if in another completely different world.However, when he walked out of the room, the strangeness was even greater, because almost everything in the place he saw was completely different from his previous cognition.Different shapes of houses, different clothes, different means of transportation, different\u2026Before he saw Lin Jiayu and the two children dressed very differently from what he used to, he thought it was the unique attire of rich people in the city, but when he came out, he saw this attire all over the street. , very common, he knows that his previous guess is likely to be wrong.Peach Blossom Village sounds like a village, maybe it\u2019s not a village like Mu\u2019s Village as he thought, maybe it\u2019s just called this, but it\u2019s actually a town, after all, everything here looks much better than their Mu\u2019s Village, even Much better than their town.\u201cBig brother, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Haohao blinked his big eyes, looking at the motionless Mu Yan in puzzlement.Because the elder brother\u2019s injury is better, so the mother asked him to take the elder brother out for a walk to relax, but why the elder brother was surprised and puzzled, as if he saw something he had never seen before. But there is nothing unusual here.Yang Yinghao, who was still young, would not have thought that the person standing in front of him actually came here from another time and space far away, so everything he saw here would make him feel strange and strange.\u201cHaohao, what is that?\u201d Mu Yan asked weakly pointing at a woman.When he saw Lin Jiayu and Yingying before, he thought they were strange and thought they were sick. However, there are so many strange people like this on the street now, so he had to ask them out. I\u2019m afraid the matter was not what he intended. As expected.Poor Mu Yan, who traveled from a world where there were only brothers and men, had never seen a creature like a woman, and it was quite normal to have such a reaction when he saw it for the first time.Yang Yinghao looked in the direction Mu Yan pointed, and for a long time he couldn\u2019t figure out what the big brother wanted to ask.\u201cBig brother, what are you asking?\u201d Yang Yinghao asked directly.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s\u2026\u201d Mu Yan couldn\u2019t keep pointing at people, after all, he knew it was impolite.\u201cAunt Lin, why are Aunt Lin and Yingying different from us?\u201d Mu Yan decided to ask in another way.Now Haohao understood, and said with a smile: \u201cI know this, because mother and sister are women, and we are men, so of course they are different from us.\u201dYang Yinghao pretended to be calm when he said it, but the smugness in his eyes betrayed his heart. At this moment, he was proud of himself for being able to answer this question.\u201cWoman? Man?\u201d Mu Yan whispered, what is that? Why has he never heard of it.\u201cHaohao, what about your brothers here, why haven\u2019t you seen them come out, is it because you don\u2019t allow brothers to go out here?\u201d Mu Yan asked, he also heard that the rules of the city people are relatively strict, and ordinary brothers They are not allowed to come out and show their faces.\u201cBrother? Isn\u2019t big brother just brother?\u201d Yang Yinghao said puzzled.Seeing this, Mu Yan also knew that the three-year-old Haohao knew very little, so he didn\u2019t continue to ask, thinking that he would figure it out.\u201cHaohao, what\u2019s that?\u201d Mu Yan suddenly saw a fast-moving iron box flash past them, which startled him.He had heard from other people who worked in the city before that people in the city made beautiful carriages when they traveled. The speed of the carriage was much faster than their ox carts. Could it be that it was a carriage just now?But, where is the horse?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No wonder I didn\u2019t see a horse.Everything he saw today was very strange and strange to him, especially the thing called a car. Just now he saw someone getting into it, and then the car swished and ran away for a long distance.Even the very fast and very good carriages described by those working in the city are not as fast as this one called a car.The two of them didn\u2019t go too far, they just took a stroll around the house, but this short distance had a strong impact on Mu Yan\u2019s three views and traditional thinking for so many years.He has seen too many things today that are different from before, even if he is dull, he can feel that something is wrong, but he doesn\u2019t dare to think deeply.Mu Yan stayed at Lin Jiayu\u2019s house for a total of seven days until his injuries healed completely. During this time, he didn\u2019t go out, and he didn\u2019t know why. He just stayed at home to help take care of the two children Yang Yinghao and Yang Yingying. Get some chores in order.People here don\u2019t farm or cook, so these are his usual necessary jobs, and he doesn\u2019t need to do them here at all. He only needs to brew a bag of nutrition powder when it\u2019s time to eat, and the rest is There was nothing to do, which was much easier than the work he did at home, which made him uncomfortable for a while.Lin Jiayu and Yang Wenyao have to go out to work every day, usually working in nearby factories to make money.Usually, the two children go to the factory with them. They work, and the children will play by themselves.But ever since Mu Yan recovered from his injury, he has been wanting to work to report on Lin Jiayu and Yang Wenyao, so the two handed over their two children to Mu Yan. It is convenient, and Yang Yinghao and Yang Yingying also like Muyan very much.In fact, there is not much work to do here, and the reason why people go to work is to earn credits, and then buy nutritional supplements and nutritional powders to allow themselves to survive.After living here for so many days, Mu Yan has also learned some common sense about this place. For example, there are no other edible things here except for nutrition powder and supplements. Not to mention rice and white noodles, there are not even some vegetables and wild vegetables. When Mu Yan first knew this, he was stunned for a long time and couldn\u2019t recover.Another example is that people here are divided into men and women. There are no brothers and men. Women are responsible for bearing and inheriting the family, while men are responsible for working and supporting the family. In this world, he is equivalent to a man. Although he can also have children, he is Same with local men.And the women here can also go out to work, such as Lin Jiayu, who went out to work with Yang Wenyao.When he just heard the news, Mu Yan\u2019s entire three views and ideas were greatly shocked!The more he understands this world, Mu Yan has a feeling in his heart that he may never go back. He never lets himself think deeply, even though that family is very cold, even though his father often beats him and scolds him, and his younger brothers are also naughty. Although, although there is not enough food and clothing there, it is his home after all. No matter how hard he suffers, he never thought of staying away from that home before getting married.After all, if he left there, where would he go as a brother?Mu Yan, who helped bring up the children these days, tried his best not to let himself think about those things, so he thought, when he repays Aunt Lin and Uncle Yang, he can go home.After staying here for a few more days, the injuries on his body have completely healed, and Mu Yan finally mustered up the courage to tell Lin Jiayu that he wants to go home.\u201cI asked someone to find out for you, but no one has heard of where the Mu Family Village is, so\u2026\u201d Lin Jiayu didn\u2019t finish speaking, with a guilty tone.\u201cNo, nothing, thank you, Aunt Lin, I can find my way home by myself.\u201d Mu Yan hurriedly comforted Lin Jiayu, for him, this family has treated him very, very well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I will definitely come back to see you and Haohao Yingying when I have time.\u201d Mu Yan said with tears in his eyes.Although the time we spent together was not too long, it was the first time in the past ten days that he felt the warmth of having a family. Even though the warmth was given by strangers, it still made him yearn for it uncontrollably.However, he knew that he had to leave, not just to go home, in fact, he had a faint premonition in his heart that maybe he would never be able to go back, but he had to try to prove what he thought , otherwise he won\u2019t feel at ease.Mu Yan asked Yang Wenyao to take him to the place where he was found, because that was the only place where clues could be found.Yang Wenyao also liked Mu Yan a lot, so he asked for leave from the factory that day, and then took Mu Yan to the forest to find him.Mu Yan fell from a cliff, but Yang Wenyao found that his place was very flat, surrounded by trees and grass, and there were no mountains, let alone cliffs.\u201cUncle Yang, is there a mountain here?\u201d Mu Yan asked with the last glimmer of hope.\u201cThe nearest mountain is three kilometers away.\u201d Yang Wenyao replied.\u201cCan I go and have a look?\u201d Mu Yan asked hesitantly.\u201cI\u2019ll take you there, it\u2019s too dangerous for you to go alone.\u201d Yang Wenyao said enthusiastically.Yang Wenyao took Mu Yan to the nearest mountain, but just at the foot of the mountain, Mu Yan knew that this was not the mountain behind their house, that is to say, he really might not be in their world anymore , although it is unbelievable to think this way, it is the best explanation. After all, he is injured and unconscious, and it is impossible for him to come to a completely strange place from the back mountain of his hometown alone.Mu Yan stood at the foot of the mountain without moving for a long time, and Yang Wenyao thoughtfully did not disturb him.He and his wife felt pity for such a boy who was sixteen years old but looked as thin as a ten-year-old boy. Although they didn\u2019t know what kind of life he had lived before, it was conceivable that he would definitely Had a bad time.\u201cUncle Yang, I, I don\u2019t seem to be able to go back.\u201d Mu Yan lowered his head and said in a low voice, with trembling and crying, which made people feel very distressed.\u201cOur family welcomes you back at any time. Haohao and Yingying are still crying and refusing to let you go today. If they know that you have gone back and won\u2019t leave, they will be very happy.\u201d Yang Wenyao stroked Mu Yan\u2019s hair , Smiling and talking, feeling sorry for this well-behaved boy.\u201cReally? I\u2026 can I really stay? But I won\u2019t live for nothing, I will do a lot of work, I can help you clean up the room, take care of Haohao and Yingying, and it\u2019s okay\u2026\u201d Mu Yan said As he said, his voice became smaller and smaller. At first he wanted to say that he could cook and farm, and he could do all kinds of rough work.However, there is no land here, no ingredients to eat, and no need to cook, so what he knows is completely useless.And he is a brother, how can a brother live with a man, especially a man who is married and has his own family, his existence will definitely affect other families.Mu Yan suddenly felt that his previous thoughts were too simple and not rigorous. He would cause great trouble to his benefactor. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t say anything dead, otherwise he would definitely feel guilty.\u201cOf course, we are usually busy with work and don\u2019t have time to accompany Haohao and Yingying. If you are willing to come and help us accompany them, you and Aunt Lin will be very grateful.\u201d Yang Wenyao said gently.\u201cThank you Uncle Yang, I, I will definitely take good care of them.\u201d Mu Yan said gratefully, \u201cBut I can\u2019t live in your house, Uncle Yang, can you help me find an unoccupied house, I, I want to live there first.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it good to live in Uncle Yang\u2019s house?\u201d Yang Wenyao felt distressed for this sensible boy. Although it would be inconvenient to have one more person in the family, it is not safe to let such a minor live alone outside. Yes, I believe Xiaoyu will be worried too.\u201cNo, it\u2019s very good, but\u2026but I can\u2019t bother you all the time, I can\u2019t repay your kindness to me anymore.\u201d Mu Yan said in a low voice.Seeing this, Yang Wenyao didn\u2019t continue this topic, and said with a smile: \u201cOkay, then I will leave it to Uncle Yang, and I will definitely find you a comfortable house.\u201d\u201cThank you Uncle Yang.\u201d Mu Yan said with a sweet smile, smiling from the bottom of his heart.Although coming to a strange world will make people feel uneasy, but for Mu Yan, this place is very good. There will be no father who beats and scolds him all day long, and there will be no father who clings to him and bullies him all day long. Brother, there will be no father who always scolds him. On the contrary, there are gentle Uncle Yang and Aunt Lin, and two lovely Haohao and Yingying, all of which make him feel like a dream. Very unreal.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This is also the worst thing he has heard since coming to this world. Good news now.Otherwise, he couldn\u2019t imagine himself living with a strange woman, maybe at that time, he would die alone.Yang Wenyao\u2019s work efficiency is very high, and he quickly found an unoccupied house for Mu Yan.The house is located on the edge of the village, close to the forest. Although the location is a little remote, the surrounding environment is very good, very suitable for teenagers to live in, and it is not far from Lin Jiayu\u2019s home, so the two families can often walk around. It can also help watch Haohao and Yingying.Mu Yan is very, very satisfied with this house.\u201cThis will be your home from now on. This is the title deed and your identity certificate. From now on, you will be a member of Taohua Village.\u201d Yang Wenyao handed the title deed and something similar to a watch to Mu Yan.I have to say that Yang Wenyao was really considerate in his work. He knew that Mu Yan came from a very distant village and he couldn\u2019t go back. He left his household registration in Taohua Village.The people in Taohua Village are relatively simple and kind, and after learning about Mu Yan\u2019s situation, they helped him with it.Mu Yan is holding a personal terminal in the shape of a watch. He has seen this before. Both Haohao and Yingying have it. This thing is very magical and has many functions. It is much more powerful than the jugglers he has seen before.But at this moment, his attention is not on the personal terminal, but on the land deed, which has his name written on it. With this, this house belongs to him.\u201cIs this, this house really mine?\u201d Mu Yan looked at the house behind him, so surprised that he was speechless.\u201cOf course, this will be your home in the future, and I\u2019ll take you to buy some things to fill the house later.\u201d Lin Jiayu also said with a smile, feeling happy for Mu Yan.\u201cBut\u2026 but is it really okay to give me such a beautiful house? I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Mu Yan couldn\u2019t believe it was true. He didn\u2019t pay anything, but he could get such a big house, which made him very happy. Anxiety and guilt.\u201cSilly boy, there are still many vacant houses like this in the village, and they are still vacant. You can live in them and increase your popularity, so you won\u2019t let the house go to waste, right?\u201d Lin Jiayu comforted Mu Yan gently. Mu Yan also liked it more.\u201cLive in. You will be a member of our Taohua Village from now on. I will introduce other villagers to you when I have time.\u201d The head of Taohua Village said with a smile.The head of Taohua Village is an old man over seventy years old, with a gray beard and a very kind smile, which makes it easy for people to feel kind and close.Looking at this beautiful big house, Mu Yan was very excited, and secretly decided that in the future, he must work harder and help these kind-hearted villagers. Without them, maybe he would sleep on the street.Mu Yan had fantasized about owning his own house before, but at that time he should have been married, and then he and his own man would have a small home that only belonged to them.But even if it was a fantasy, the imaginary house is just a thatched hut that can shelter from the wind and rain. Even so, he feels very satisfied, but he never thought that one day he would be able to own it before he got married. A house that belongs to him, and it is such a big and beautiful house, which is many times more beautiful than the house of the village chief in their village.For a moment, Mu Yan felt that he was dreaming, and it was a beautiful dream. Maybe he woke up from the dream and returned to that dilapidated hut, without his own room. He was busy at home every day and had to bear the burden of his parents. beating and scolding.If all of this is really a dream, then he hopes that this dream can continue forever and never wake up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Whether it is clothing or lifestyle, he tries to get close to the people here. For this reason, he has been working hard to learn the common sense here and use of various tools.Mu Yan himself is quite smart, and these common sense things can basically be mastered by teaching them once. Yang Wenyao and Lin Jiayu only think that Mu Yan used to live in a place that is more backward than theirs, so it is normal not to understand these things , and will guide him very patiently.After adapting to the new life, Mu Yan has new troubles.\u201cYan Yan, what\u2019s the matter? Is there something on your mind recently?\u201d The careful Lin Jiayu found out that something was wrong with Mu Yan recently, so she took the initiative to ask.She really likes this child. Although the other party is sixteen years old and will soon become an adult, she still can\u2019t help but want to treat him as a child as old as Haohao. After all, the thin Mu Yan It\u2019s easy to be overwhelmed by maternal love.\u201cAunt Lin, does the clearing in the forest have an owner?\u201d Mu Yan hesitated for a long time, but finally couldn\u2019t resist the desire in his heart, and asked boldly.\u201cHuh? That one doesn\u2019t have an owner, why does Yan Yan ask that?\u201d Lin Jiayu was puzzled.\u201cThen, can you lend me those open spaces?\u201d When Mu Yan said this, his eyes sparkled, and his whole face lit up, making it hard to refuse.Lin Jiayu was overwhelmed by Mu Yan\u2019s expression, and always felt that it would be cruel to reject such a child.\u201cOf course you can. You can use it however you want. No one can use it.\u201d Lin Jiayu said with a smile.Hearing the words, Mu Yan immediately felt extremely happy. He found that people here did not farm at all, so there were lots of open spaces in the village. He was very greedy to see them, but he also knew that even if those open spaces were not used for sowing, they could still be planted. He has no right to use what belongs to others, and he will not greedily occupy other people\u2019s land.Therefore, Mu Yan didn\u2019t plan on those open spaces in the village, but set his sights on those lands in the forest that were suitable for planting but no one used them.After getting Lin Jiayu\u2019s affirmation, Mu Yan couldn\u2019t wait to plant something.He really thinks this world is really good, and he has all the things he longed for in the past. He has his own house and land, and his life can\u2019t be better.But soon, the excitement subsided, because Mu Yan remembered a very important thing, that is, although he had land, he had no seeds.People in this world don\u2019t farm, so naturally they don\u2019t have seeds, and without seeds, how can they farm?Mu Yan was a little entangled, but he was not willing to let him give up the land he had so hard to get, and he also sympathized with the people here who could only eat dry nutritional powder and nutritional supplements.Although in his place, people may not eat better than nutrition powder, but they can still eat some good things occasionally, such as meat, and occasionally go to the market in the town to buy some snacks and the like.Although he hasn\u2019t eaten it, he has seen his younger brothers eat it. The smell is very tempting, and it will be even more delicious if it tastes.Therefore, Mu Yan decided that he must find a way to find seeds that can be planted, and then grow edible food and crops, so that the villagers can taste the delicious food.From Mu Yan\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s a pity that everyone has never tasted so many delicious foods, and besides this, he has nothing else he can do for everyone.After setting the goal, Mu Yan became even more motivated.Mu Yan thought of the forest he had been to before. Although he hadn\u2019t observed the forest carefully because he was thinking about going home, there were a lot of plants in the forest, and there must be something edible among them. As long as there were, There must be seeds.There are a lot of wild vegetables and fruits on the back hill of his previous home, and I believe there will be some in the forest, so the most urgent task now is to dig out the land first, and then find the seeds.In the past, Mu Yan often went to the back mountain alone, so he dared to go to the forest alone, and his home was the closest to the forest, so it was more convenient to go to the forest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He also knows that as a minor child here, he can\u2019t go out to work, and he can\u2019t make money to buy nutrition powder.Aunt Lin and Uncle Yang kept sending their children here because they knew their situation, and then used this to give themselves nutrition powder. Mu Yan kept this love in mind.\u201cLet\u2019s dig the fields.\u201d Mu Yan replied patiently.\u201cWhat is a field?\u201d Yang Yingying asked in confusion.\u201cA field is land on which food can be grown.\u201d\u201cThen what is food?\u201d Yang Yingying seemed to have transformed into a hundred thousand whys, and she was very curious about what Mu Yan said.\u201cFood is just like nutritional powder, it\u2019s something you can eat, and it\u2019s delicious.\u201d Mu Yan said with a smile.After eating the nutrition powder here for almost a month, even Mu Yan, who has always been able to endure hardships, couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, not because the nutrition powder was not full, but because that kind of thing had no taste at all.Although nutrition powder is much more delicious than rice soup without rice, it has no taste at all. His previous meals are also very bad, not even as mushy as nutrition powder brewed, but at least he can eat it every day. Some salt, some wild vegetables.Therefore, he really didn\u2019t understand why the people here could only eat nutrition powder for the rest of their lives. When he thought that he would only be able to eat nutrition powder in the future, he felt terrible.In any case, he had to improve his food, not to mention big fish and meat, at least some vegetables and salt that the human body needed.This is probably the desire for appetite. As the saying goes, \u201cFood is the most important thing for the people\u201d, which is enough to show how important food is to human beings.\u201cIs food a nutrient? Nutrients are better than nutritional powder.\u201d Yang Yinghao, who had been trying to pretend to be calm, couldn\u2019t help but speak after hearing Mu Yan\u2019s words.Dad would occasionally buy nutritional supplements for them. Some of the nutritional supplements were sweet and some were sour, and they were much more delicious than tasteless nutritional powder. However, the price of one nutritional supplement was very expensive, and you could buy three of them. The amount of nutrient powder for the day is too small, so the family rarely buys nutrient supplements.\u201cFood is just a general term. Many edible things are called grain. You will know when I grow them in the future.\u201d Mu Yan was a little confused to explain, so he could only speak roughly.\u201cOh.\u201d Although Yang Yingying and Yang Yinghao didn\u2019t quite understand, they always felt that what Brother Yan said was very powerful. Food is very much looking forward to.Mu Yan took the two children to wander around the edge of the forest, exploring the places suitable for farming, but they didn\u2019t go deep, after all, it was still a bit dangerous for children.Of course, unknown places are also very dangerous for him.In the end, Mu Yan set aside an area of about one mu of land closest to his home, and he was not greedy, even though the land here was unowned.And in this world where no one has ever farmed the land, he still doesn\u2019t know if he can find the seeds for cultivation, so he first set aside an acre of land for trial planting, and if he succeeds, he will set aside more land in the future.The scope of the land has been determined, and the next step is to start manual digging.Although Mu Yan is an elder brother, he is a good hand at work, because the younger brothers in the family are too young to work, so all the work falls on him, and sometimes he has to go to the field when the farming is busy. Helping his father to do it together, he is also familiar with the process of digging the ground.However, there is no farming in this world, and naturally there will be no corresponding tools. Mu Yan still needs to find a way by himself.\u201cYou two should be obedient here and don\u2019t wander around here. Brother, go ahead and find something, and come back soon.\u201d Mu Yan repeatedly told the two children, but in the end he was still not at ease, and looked back at the two children step by step. A child, did not go too far.Mu Yan found a relatively thick branch, and then used the rope he brought from home to make a simple farming tool.There are very few families with cattle in Mujia Village, and most of them plow the land by themselves, so this is nothing to Mu Yan, but he has just plowed a step\u2026\u201cDing, the trigger condition has been met, the system is starting!

Children of this age are very active, and this is a rare time to come out to play, so I can\u2019t wait to have fun. I will go to see the wild flowers for a while, and touch them in surprise for a while. Touching the trees is a joy to play.After coaxing the two children, Mu Yan put his mind on the so-called system.\u201cI\u2019m not a thing, I\u2019m a food system. It has been detected that there is a serious shortage of food in this world. In order to popularize and carry forward the food culture, I have chosen you to be my host. Let us work together to spread the food culture to the whole world, so that these Poor people, let\u2019s feel the charm of delicious food too!\u201d The system no longer had the cold, mechanized voice at the beginning, but was full of emotion, ambition, and high-spirited.\u201cGourmet system?\u201d Mu Yan\u2019s mood had stabilized a little, probably because he realized that this so-called system would not hurt him, so his reaction was not as big as before.As for why a system suddenly appeared in his mind, Mu Yan was not surprised. After all, he can come to a completely strange world from his own world, so he can accept some extraordinary things. up.\u201cYes, there are only tasteless nutritional supplements and nutritional powders that can be eaten in this world. It is simply too barren. The human beings here are really pitiful. They can\u2019t enjoy so many delicious things. It\u2019s really boring to live. \u201cThe system said pitifully.Mu Yan nodded quietly. In this aspect, he also recognized the system. It is a great pity in life not to be able to eat so many delicious things.\u201cSo, the existence of our food system is to allow people in the world without food culture to eat rich and delicious things, so that their lives will be richer.\u201d The system is full of passion, if there is an entity , must be clenched fists, head held high, full of fighting spirit.The purpose of the system coincides with Mu Yan\u2019s, but Mu Yan doesn\u2019t have such great ambitions, he just wants to plant something himself to repay Aunt Lin Yang and the enthusiastic villagers in the village, and he doesn\u2019t care about it. He didn\u2019t think about spreading it to the whole world, and he couldn\u2019t do it himself.The system seemed to know what Mu Yan was thinking, and said, \u201cSo I chose you and me to achieve this great goal together.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 but I know only a few kinds of wild vegetables and grains. It is not certain whether there is one in this world. How can it be realized?\u201d Mu Yan asked his own doubts.\u201cIt\u2019s no problem. You just need to do what I said. The system can be upgraded. After each level up, there will be a recipe or seeds. After level ten, farms and pastures will be opened. Sometimes it can be planted in the system,\u201d said the system.Mu Yan\u2019s eyes widened slightly, and he was very surprised. He didn\u2019t expect the system to be such a magical existence, and his impression of the system changed immediately.\u201cYou are amazing.\u201d Mu Yan couldn\u2019t help but praise, with admiration shining in his eyes.The system\u2019s admiration for Mu Yan was very beneficial, and he puffed up his chest even more, and said proudly: \u201cThis is just the most basic, as long as you work hard, you can also get a chance to draw a lottery, and the rewards in it are rich.\u201d , are all good things for you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As long as you do what I say, you will definitely be able to make a lot of delicious food, and make people in this world worship you.\u201d The system continued.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Mu Yan didn\u2019t answer the system, and suddenly thought of this question.system:\u2026The system that originally wanted to boast more about itself and make the host admire itself more, was suddenly stuck by Mu Yan\u2019s question, and the words that were about to be exported were abruptly held back. Fortunately, the system did not show a real body, otherwise His face would definitely be flushed red.\u201cMy name is No. 5, and I am the fifth system to be created. The other systems are not as powerful as me.\u201d The system introduced narcissistically, \u201cAlthough there are four in front of me, they are all incomplete systems. , only I am the most perfect.\u201dIf Mu Yan could look up at this moment, he would be able to see the guilty expression on the face of the system itself in the void, obviously the facts did not match what he said.But Mu Yan didn\u2019t see it, but he was very supportive, and said with sincerity on his face: \u201cYou are really amazing.\u201dSeeing the support of the host he chose, No. 5 felt even more proud. This is the host he chose, and it really is the best.He had heard before that the hosts chosen by the other systems didn\u2019t believe them at first, hmph, as expected, he was the best.Number five slowly flew in front of Mu Yan, and finally revealed its real body in front of him.Mu Yan looked at the round, fluffy snow-white ball that suddenly appeared in front of him in surprise, and couldn\u2019t help poking it with his little finger.\u201cDon\u2019t poke it, it will break it.\u201d Number five twisted her chubby body to avoid the host\u2019s naughty little hand.\u201cAre you number five? It looks like a fur ball.\u201d Mu Yan looked at number five and said subconsciously.\u201cYou are the furball, and your whole family is furball.\u201d No. 5 became furious when he heard this, and the hairs all over his body stood up, more like a big furball that was blown up suddenly.He doesn\u2019t like to hear others say that he is a hairball. This body is so cute. After he chose such a body, those abominable guys laughed at him every day for being a hairball. Wouldn\u2019t he have a rounder body? , Are the legs and feet shorter, but the fact that they are legs and feet cannot be denied.As if to prove himself, No. 5 tried his best to stretch out the legs and feet covered by the plush, and said angrily: \u201cSee, I also have legs and feet. Does furball have legs?\u201dMu Yan looked at the legs and feet that were so short that they could almost be ignored, and looked at the hairy No. 5, suddenly felt that what he said just now was disrespectful and very bad, so he apologized to No. 5 very seriously.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t notice it just now, and I won\u2019t in the future.\u201d Mu Yan said.No. 5 was stunned. This was the first person who apologized to him for such a thing. He really deserved to be the host he chose.Number five\u2019s mood immediately became beautiful.\u201cSince you have apologized, then I will not care about you.\u201d Number five said arrogantly.Mu Yan also smiled, and was not unhappy because of No. 5\u2019s arrogance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He hasn\u2019t dug the soil yet, and it\u2019s already afternoon. If you don\u2019t hurry up, you won\u2019t be able to finish it today.So, Mu Yan picked up the simple homemade farming tools and worked hard to turn the land.The land at the edge of the forest is relatively solid, and no one has ever turned it over, so this job is extremely difficult for Mu Yan.My brother\u2019s physical strength and physique are much weaker than men\u2019s. Even in this world, it\u2019s still the same. His strength can\u2019t even compare with some stronger women.After working for a long time, I only scratched shallow marks on the ground, let alone turned it over.\u201cYour tools are too crude.\u201d No. 5 looked at Mu Yan\u2019s self-made tools and said contemptuously.\u201cThere are no other tools here. I made this one myself.\u201d Mu Yan sat beside him, panting heavily, obviously very tired.\u201cThere are very useful tools in the system, which are much better than yours.\u201d Number Five said.\u201cReally?\u201d Mu Yan\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up. If he had a tool at hand, he could turn over the ground faster, otherwise he would not be able to turn it over.\u201cOf course.\u201d Number Five\u2019s proud voice sounded again, but\u2026\u201cBut those are not for nothing. You have to let me upgrade quickly. Only after I upgrade can I use the tools in the system. So don\u2019t think about digging the ground now, and upgrade quickly is the right thing to do.\u201d Five No. said.\u201cThen how can I upgrade?\u201d Mu Yan asked.Number five: \u201cYou only need to find ten kinds of edible food in this world and make them into dishes, and the system can be upgraded to the first level.\u201d\u201cTen types of edible food?\u201d Mu Yan repeated. He knew only a limited number of wild vegetables, and there might not be any in this world. Where can I find these edible things?\u201cThe system comes with a certain food identification function. The higher the level, the stronger the identification function. However, you are now at level zero, and you cannot use this function of the system for the time being, so it is up to you to identify it yourself. You can You must be careful.\u201d No. 5 warned, he can\u2019t die because of eating poisonous things, he is still very satisfied with this host, and doesn\u2019t want to change hosts for the time being.\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Yan replied.Since the system must be upgraded to get the tools, the land can no longer be turned over now, and there is no rush anyway, Mu Yan still has this bit of patience.\u201cYingying, Haohao, we\u2019re going back.\u201d Mu Yan shouted to the two who were having fun.With two children here today, he couldn\u2019t go to the forest to find ingredients, so he had to wait another day.Going to the forest to find food is the way Mu Yan is currently thinking of. If you want to say where the most food is eaten, it is probably in the forest. After all, the forest is the greatest gift of nature to human beings.\u201cBrother Yan, are we going back now?\u201d Yang Yingying looked at Mu Yan with wide eyes, with reluctance for the forest in her eyes.\u201cWell, Uncle Yang and Aunt Lin are about to leave work.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026then can we still come and play in the future?\u201d Yang Yingying asked expectantly.Although Yang Yinghao didn\u2019t speak, his quietly pricked up ears betrayed his current mood.\u201cOkay, but you have to come here when I\u2019m here, you can\u2019t sneak here by yourself.\u201d Mu Yan said gently to the two children.He will come here often in the future, and of course he will bring the two little ones with him.\u201cWell, Yingying is very obedient and obedient.\u201d Yang Yingying immediately showed a sweet smile on her small face, and even the stern-faced Yang Yinghao\u2019s mouth slightly curled up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Haohao and Yingying stayed at home with their parents. Mu Yan also took advantage of this time to go to the forest to see if he could find any wild vegetables and fruits he knew.As a brother, Mu Yan, although he often ran to the back mountain before, he usually stayed on the edge of the back mountain, and he never went inside, because it was very dangerous for his brother, and it is the same now, Mu Yan Yan Ye only dared to go in a little bit from the edge of the forest, and he didn\u2019t dare to go in any deeper.\u201cThis forest is very big, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to find ten kinds of edible things soon.\u201d No. 5 flew in mid-air, right next to Mu Yan.Although it wasn\u2019t the first time for Mu Yan to come to the forest, he came in once when he wanted to find his way back home, but it was the first time he really looked at the forest here.There are many, many species in the forest, but they are all very strange to Mu Yan, most of them have never been seen before, even if some look slightly familiar, they are not exactly the same as the things in his world , which made him not sure whether these things could be eaten.\u201cOh, there are so many things in this forest, but the people on this planet guard such a huge resource but don\u2019t know how to use it. They are so stupid.\u201d No. 5 chattered and criticized the world\u2019s food culture along the way. Criticize the world for nothing.From No. 5\u2019s point of view, there is nothing in this world that makes people happier than delicious food. There are so many delicious things to eat. That feeling is definitely the most wonderful in the world. Unfortunately, people in this world have never enjoyed it. This wonderful feeling is so pitiful and so regrettable.\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter, now that the great No. 5 is here, they will definitely be able to taste these delicious things. Then they will know how attractive the food is, and they will definitely admire me very much, haha\u2026\u201d When No. 5 thought of such a scene, he couldn\u2019t help laughing smugly.But when he saw Mu Yan, he suddenly felt guilty, worried that he would be unhappy, and quickly added: \u201cOf course, you are also very good, and you have made a little contribution, and everyone will remember you.\u201dMu Yan didn\u2019t hear what No. 5 was saying clearly. He focused all his attention on searching for ingredients, and suddenly a familiar and unfamiliar object appeared in his sight. Mu Yan\u2019s eyes lit up suddenly, and he ran all the way. came under a tree.\u201cMushrooms, it\u2019s mushrooms.\u201d Mu Yan said excitedly, looking at the clusters of gray, unpleasant-looking mushrooms.Along the way, he also encountered many familiar things, but he was not sure about them, and naturally he did not dare to pick them. It was not until he encountered mushrooms that Mu Yan showed a small smile on his face.\u201cIs this a mushroom?\u201d No. 5 took a closer look curiously, and then flew away with a look of disgust, \u201cIt\u2019s so ugly and smelly.\u201dSeeing this, Mu Yan smiled and said, \u201cThe smell of mushrooms is indeed not very pleasant, but it tastes delicious.\u201dIn the past, whenever it rained, he would go to the back mountain to look for things like mushrooms and fungus. The side dishes he made were very delicious, especially the soup.Thinking of that taste, Mu Yan felt that his mouth was about to water. After eating nutrition powder for so long, he could finally change the taste.\u201cReally? Really delicious?\u201d No. 5 asked with bright eyes, and then recorded the dusty mushroom in his system knowledge base.Because he is level zero and still in the initialization state, he has nothing in the system, so he naturally doesn\u2019t know these ingredients.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After finding the mushrooms, he came across a kind of wild vegetable he was familiar with \u2013 amaranth.Both Mu Yan and No. 5 are very satisfied with today\u2019s harvest.\u201cYanyan, Yanyan, let\u2019s go home and cook.\u201d No. 5 couldn\u2019t wait to go back, you know, he hasn\u2019t eaten delicious food for a long time, but he is so hungry.After Mu Yan went back, he washed the picked mushrooms and amaranth clean, and then the problem came again.People in this world have never turned on a fire to cook, so there are no cooking tools or stoves.The stove is okay, you can build a simple stove in the yard, and then use firewood to light the fire, but it is more difficult to handle the pots and pans for cooking.No. 5 looked at Mu Yan who was worried about the kitchen utensils, looked at the freshly washed amaranth and mushrooms, couldn\u2019t help swallowing a few mouthfuls of saliva, his little furry face seemed to be struggling with something, and finally seemed to have made up his mind What kind of determination is mediocre, and he said to Mu Yan: \u201cYanyan, I have kitchen utensils here, but I need to redeem them with points. You are now level zero, so there is no way to exchange them, but I can lend them to you. When you have points in the future, you can use them. The points are coming back.\u201dMu Yan heard the words and asked, \u201cHow do you get points?\u201d\u201cIn the future, I will release some random small tasks one after another. Every time the task is completed, you will get points. Of course, you will also get points for cooking. Although the points are relatively small, the more you do, the more points you will get.\u201d Five No. is introduced in detail.Mu Yan thought for a while, since you can get points for cooking in the future, then the points should not be too rare, and it is also possible to exchange them for kitchen utensils, so he nodded immediately and said, \u201cYes.\u201dHowever, No. 5 didn\u2019t feel happy. Instead, he added a little unnaturally, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 the points to be paid in the future are five times the normal requirements.\u201dThat is to say, if it costs 100 to exchange points for kitchen utensils directly, then 500 will have to be paid back at that time. Thinking about it, it is quite tricky, so No. 5 is worried that Mu Yan will refuse after hearing it.Mu Yan was silent for a moment, No. 5 immediately stared at him nervously, and then heard Mu Yan say: \u201cGive me the kitchen utensils.\u201dNo. 5 was finally relieved, and immediately took out the kitchen utensils cheerfully, and explained the additional functions of these kitchen utensils to Mu Yan carefully, but Mu Yan was all focused on the food that was about to be prepared at the moment. How did you hear No. 5\u2019s explanation?\u201cNo. 5, do you have any seasoning?\u201d Mu Yan asked directly. After the incident with the kitchen utensils, he felt that he could ask No. 5 directly if he felt that there was something missing in the future.Sure enough, No. 5 gave an affirmative answer, \u201cIt\u2019s the same as kitchen utensils, and it needs to be repaid with five times the points in the future.\u201d\u201cThen give me some salt.\u201d Mu Yan thought for a while and said.Salt is an essential seasoning for cooking. As for the others, you can look for alternatives in the forest later, or redeem them after you have points.No. 5 handed Mu Yan a small bag of salt, and then Mu Yan started to build a simple stove, ready to cook.\u201cYanyan, what if there are only vegetables but no staple food? I still have flour and rice here, do you want it?\u201d asked No. 5.\u201cI don\u2019t need this for now.\u201d Mu Yan said, he already owed a lot of points, and I\u2019m afraid it will be difficult to pay them off in the future.Hearing the words, No. 5 was a little disappointed, drooping his head, surrounded by a melancholy atmosphere.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Don\u2019t you want to eat vegetables at noon?\u201dHe doesn\u2019t want to eat this kind of tasteless nutritional powder, it\u2019s simply poisoning the tongue!\u201cDon\u2019t you want to eat the staple food? I\u2019ll give you pimples for lunch.\u201d Mu Yan said, in fact, he prefers to eat pancakes, but there is no oil here, so he can only choose some staple foods that don\u2019t need oil.As soon as No. 5 heard that Mu Yan was going to make delicious food for him, he immediately circled around Mu Yan excitedly, with small eyes looking at the nutrition powder from time to time, wanting to know how this thing turned into delicious food.Mu Yan poured part of the nutritional powder into the basin, then added a little salt, and stirred with warm water, so that the nutritional powder condensed into small lumps.The nutrient powder is thicker than white flour, and more small lumps are formed, and the scattered powder is less. Muyan put it aside for later use, then put the pot on the stove to boil water, and pour the small lumps into the pot.This is Mu Yan\u2019s first time using nutrition powder to make gnocchi, and he has no idea about the result.When the pot was opened again, Mu Yan put in a little salt, and then put some washed mushrooms and amaranth into it, and the fragrance became more intense immediately, and each white and fat gnocchi floated in the water. The purple-green amaranth is very beautiful in color matching.Number five looked at the pot of gnocchi, and tried hard not to drool, because it would really damage his great image of number five.After the pimple soup is ready, put it in a bowl, and then stir-fry the remaining mushrooms and amaranth.Originally, Mu Yan wanted to make mushroom soup. The soup made from mushrooms tastes very delicious, but when he thought that there was already lump soup, he decided to stir fry it directly.Mu Yan\u2019s speed is very fast, it can be seen that he is already used to doing these things.\u201cYanyan, Yanyan, is it ready to eat?\u201d No. 5 looked at the pimple soup and fried mushrooms on the table, smelling the tempting aroma, and couldn\u2019t wait to move his chopsticks.\u201cCan you eat these things?\u201d Mu Yan asked, looking at No. 5\u2019s chubby body.In fact, what he wanted to ask more was, where should No. 5 be eaten? But after thinking about it, afraid of provoking number five, he changed the way of asking.\u201cOf course.\u201d Number Five immediately puffed up his inconspicuous chest and said.Isn\u2019t it too pitiful not to be able to eat delicious food, he doesn\u2019t want to become like the people here.Hearing this, Mu Yan felt relieved, found a relatively small bowl, filled out No. 5\u2019s portion, handed it to No. 5, and told him to eat carefully.\u201cIs it delicious?\u201d Mu Yan saw that No. 5 was eating very happily, and thought that the taste should be okay.\u201cGood time, good time.\u201d No. 5 replied vaguely while struggling to eat.Hearing this, Mu Yan felt relieved a little, and found a bigger bowl, and took out a large portion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You eat first, there\u2019s not enough left in the bowl.\u201d Mu Yan replied, and then walked towards where Yang Yinghao was with the big bowl.The distance between the two is not too far. After arriving at Haohao\u2019s house, the food in the bowl is still as if it was just out of the pan.Before Mu Yan entered the door, he heard a crisp voice from inside, \u201cIt smells so good, why is it so fragrant?\u201dMu Yan smiled in his heart, Yingying\u2019s nose is good, she smelled it before she went in.\u201cBrother Yan, you are here. What are you holding in your hand? It smells so good.\u201d When Yang Yingying saw Mu Yan, she immediately greeted Mu Yan with a bright smile, and then noticed that Brother Yan seemed to be holding something in his hand.

What is that? Is it something grown by Brother Yan?\u201d Yang Yingying asked several questions in a row. She still remembered that Mu Yan told him that delicious things could be grown in the field a few days ago.\u201cYan Yan is here, come in quickly.\u201d Lin Jiayu heard something outside, so she came out to have a look, seeing that it was Mu Yan, she hurriedly asked someone to come in and sit down.\u201cAunt Lin, I made something today, please have a taste.\u201d Mu Yan put the big bowl in his hand on the table, then lifted the lid, and the fragrance immediately permeated the whole room.\u201cIt smells so good.\u201d Lin Jiayu couldn\u2019t help admiring.This fragrance is different from other fragrances they have smelled before. Strictly speaking, this smell is not really fragrant. After all, there are other things compared to flower perfume, and this smell is a bit strong, but in the mind But I couldn\u2019t find any other suitable adjective.Moreover, the scent of flowers is felt from the nose, but this fragrance seems to jump out from the tip of the tongue. It is obvious that there is no taste, but there is such a feeling, which is very magical.\u201cMom, Mom, I want to eat.\u201d Seeing the big bowl being opened, Yang Yingying couldn\u2019t wait.Lin Jiayu was also very curious and wanted to taste what this fragrant thing was, but seeing the expectant eyes of the two children, she had to serve them a small bowl first.Yang Yinghao and Yang Yingying held their small bowls and started to eat unceremoniously. Yang Yinghao was better, he kept thinking that he was a young adult, and his performance was considered calm, but Yang Yingying\u2019s performance was more straightforward. Mouth, the whole person lights up.\u201cMom, this food is so delicious, even better than nutritional supplements.\u201d Yang Yingying said excitedly, not forgetting to continue to eat rice.\u201cEat slowly, don\u2019t choke.\u201d Lin Jiayu couldn\u2019t help but take a sip when she saw the delicious taste of the two children\u2019s food. Her almost unused taste buds were conquered in an instant. The fragrance that danced on the tip of her tongue She couldn\u2019t help but think about it again and again.When Lin Jiayu recovered from this feast of taste, he had already eaten half of the food in the big bowl, and his face turned red immediately.This kind of eating in front of the junior made her feel very embarrassed.\u201cBrother Yan, you are so amazing. This food is really delicious. Can Yingying still eat it in the future?\u201d Yang Yingying held the shiny little bowl she licked and asked expectantly.\u201cOf course, if Yingying likes it, I can make it for you at any time.\u201d Mu Yan said with a smile, he also felt very happy when someone liked what he made.\u201cYanyan, this is not good, this is too precious.\u201d Lin Jiayu said shyly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

These pots and pans, if there is no number five, he will have a headache for a long time, even if there are ingredients, he may not be able to make them, so he thinks it is right to eat more number five.Moreover, when he was at home, he often didn\u2019t have enough to eat.

Even in the face of many enemies, they all firmly believe that the boss can return safely.However, this is not an excuse to let those people go. Since those people dare to provoke them, they will definitely make those people pay a heavy price and make them regret coming to this world!The evacuated soldiers all had stern and cruel faces on their faces, looking at the warships that fired at their warships, their eyes seemed to be looking at dead people and garbage.The lifeboat separated from the warship itself, and the warship took the opportunity to attract all the enemy\u2019s artillery fire, covering the small lifeboats out of the combat range.There was only one man left on the entire warship. He nimbly tapped the buttons on the control panel with ten fingers. In his hands, the warship was as nimble as a human body.

However, only one man can complete the task of multi-person cooperation, and it also makes the warship more flexible.

Your warship has run out of energy. If you surrender obediently, maybe we can leave you with a dead body!\u201d Similar words kept coming from the enemy warship, but the man But he turned a deaf ear, as always, he fired the cannonball when he should fire the cannon, and dodged when he should dodge, without any intention of stopping.The man makes the best use of every bit of energy, and makes the most of every shell until there is only the last shell left.

This time, he even made a small backpack for him when he came here. With a bright smile on his face, he was obviously in a very good mood.\u201cWe\u2019ve already found this area, and we\u2019re moving forward.\u201d Mu Yan said to No. 5.No. 5 floated around Mu Yan, and accompanied him to search for ingredients. Although he doesn\u2019t know many ingredients now, he can pretend that he knows it. After all, he is the most perfect and greatest No. 5 gourmet system.The trees in this world are very tall, at least for Mu Yan, walking in the forest is like being isolated from the world.In addition to searching for some familiar wild vegetables on the ground, Mu Yan will also look up, trying to find some familiar wild fruits.Along the way, I also saw many trees bearing fruit, some of which must be edible, but Mu Yan didn\u2019t know him, and he didn\u2019t dare to pick them lightly, for fear of being poisonous.And on the 5th, I also said before that as long as the system is upgraded, I will have a certain ability to distinguish ingredients in the future.So Mu Yan decided that he should be more conservative, look for ingredients that he can confirm 100% to go back, and wait until he upgrades to identify these strange plants.Mu Yan walked leisurely in the forest, not as if he was out looking for ingredients, but as if he was here for a walk.Ever since he came to this world, Mu Yan felt that life was perfect. He didn\u2019t need to do a lot of work every day and couldn\u2019t get enough to eat. He had his own house, his own field, and he could come to the forest to find some food. , he is really satisfied with his present life, which he never imagined.Sometimes Mu Yan also feels that his current life is like a beautiful dream. When he wakes up from the dream, he is still in that dilapidated hut, doing the same work every day.\u201cYanyan, I found a mushroom, it\u2019s so beautiful, it must be delicious too.\u201d The voice of No. 5 interrupted Mu Yan\u2019s fugue.Mu Yan followed No. 5\u2019s voice to look for it, and saw No. 5 flying around in circles at low altitude, salivating and drooling at some colorful mushrooms under the tree.\u201cYanyan, quickly pick some and go home to eat.\u201d No. 5 said eagerly to Muyan.These mushrooms look so beautiful, they are much more beautiful than the ones picked by Yanyan yesterday, and they must be much more delicious. Such mushrooms are for people to eat.\u201cThese are poisonous mushrooms, you can\u2019t eat them.\u201d Mu Yan said to No. 5.Number five suddenly stopped flying, with a confused look on his face, \u201cHow can such a beautiful mushroom be poisonous?\u201d\u201cThe brighter the color of the mushroom, the more poisonous it is, and it cannot be eaten. Only the one I picked yesterday can be eaten.\u201d Mu Yan explained patiently.No. 5\u2019s expression suddenly collapsed (don\u2019t ask me why I can see the expression on a chubby hairy face, I can see it), the expression on the face is unlovable, obviously so beautiful, but poisonous, Life\u2026 no, it is the system that can be so difficult, tired and unloved.\u201cLet\u2019s go ahead and have a look, we\u2019re sure we can find something to eat.\u201d Seeing that No. 5 was hit, Mu Yan quickly comforted him.Mu Yan still likes No. 5 very much. Apart from the fact that he is a system, he is very cute just because of his furry appearance, not to mention that he is the first one to accompany him for a long time after he came to this world. Those who follow him naturally have more preference.No. 5 was worried for a while, but soon cheered up again when Mu Yan said that there was something to eat, and circled around Mu Yan non-stop.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Mu Yan found some mushrooms and even some fungus. On the way, he was very lucky to meet an injured rabbit.Seeing someone approaching, Rabbit struggled to escape, but because of his heavy injuries, he couldn\u2019t run far, and was knocked unconscious by Mu Yan bravely with a wooden stick.Looking at the mushrooms, fungus and rabbits in the basket, Mu Yan showed a big smile, obviously very satisfied with the harvest this time.He hasn\u2019t tasted meat for a long time.Mu Yan looked up at the sky, and felt that it was still early, and the weather was fine today, so he could stay a little longer, maybe he could find other ingredients, so he decided to have lunch in the forest.\u201cNo. 5, let\u2019s have lunch here. I\u2019ll cook you roasted rabbits and mushrooms.\u201d Mu Yan said to No. 5.\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Hearing that there is something delicious, Number Five spun around excitedly.\u201cGo and see if there is a small river nearby, so I can deal with rabbits and wash vegetables.\u201d Mu Yan urged.No. 5 received the task, and immediately flew into the air happily to find the water source. Relying on its ability to fly, it didn\u2019t take long to find a suitable place, and then walked towards the small river with one person and one system.Mu Yan has also dealt with chickens and ducks before, so he also treated rabbits in the same way as chickens and ducks, and cleaned all the mushrooms and fungus.Kitchen utensils have always been placed in the system space of No. 5, so it is very convenient to use now, but the stove still needs to be prepared by yourself, but it is not troublesome.Mu Yan finished the stove, filled the pot with water halfway, and used it to cook the mushroom soup. By the way, he also cut off some rabbit meat and cooked it together. The rest of the rabbit meat and mushrooms were all used for barbecue.Although there is not enough seasoning, the wild rabbits here are pure natural, just sprinkled with a little salt to roast them, they are already very, very fragrant. For Mu Yan and No. 5 who have never eaten before, this is definitely rare delicious.No. 5 itself is not big, and now the whole hairball is lying on the rabbit\u2019s leg, eating very happily, from a distance, it looks like a hairball has grown on the rabbit\u2019s leg.\u201cIt\u2019s a good time, it\u2019s a good time.\u201d No. 5 kept twisting his body while chewing, and praised vaguely.\u201cDrink more soup.\u201d Mu Yan filled a bowl of mushroom broth and put it next to No. 5. Looking at No. 5 who was eating oil all over his body, Mu Yan was a little worried. He didn\u2019t know what would happen if a system ate it. Can\u2019t digest?However, obviously No. 5 didn\u2019t notice, or in other words, didn\u2019t have time to notice Mu Yan\u2019s thoughts at all, because all his attention was on the rabbit\u2019s legs at the moment.One person and one system all ate a full meal, and the stomach was rounded. As for how No. 5 could see it, it was entirely because it was originally a regular spherical shape, but now it has become a football shape, with a convex middle.Although one person and one system ate a lot, there is still a lot left over. After all, as a brother, Mu Yan doesn\u2019t eat much. Even if number five eats a lot, but it still has a size limit, and there is no way to eat more. The two were reluctant to throw away the rest, and finally packed them all up, put them in the small back basket, and continued to search for other ingredients.In the afternoon, Mu Yan found another familiar ingredient, but the place where this ingredient grew was so strange that when Mu Yan first saw it, he was stunned for five minutes.\u201cYanyan, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d No. 5 couldn\u2019t help asking seeing Muyan standing still with his head raised in a daze.No. 5 followed Mu Yan\u2019s line of sight and saw a tree full of fruits.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Five immediately became excited at the thought of this possibility.Although it only ate two meals, No. 5 feels that it can eat delicious food. The system is really not perfect. It has been too long since the last host left, and it has no food by itself. , Of course, even if there are ingredients, he can\u2019t cook.Now that it has managed to eat something again, and it tastes good, what it is most passionate about now is to find ingredients and make them into delicious food.\u201cYanyan, Yanyan, is this edible?\u201d No. 5 circled around Muyan, asked excitedly, and then flew to the tree, wanting to pick a fruit.But the fruit on the tree is as big as a size five and two bodies, and with its short hands and feet, it can\u2019t even be hugged, so it can\u2019t be expected to pick it off.However, the potential of a foodie is unlimited. Don\u2019t underestimate the power of a foodie. No. 5 clings tightly to the fruit, then swings back and forth, trying to shake the fruit off.Not to mention, this method is quite useful, the fruit that was too big for No. 5 was really shaken down by him, and then No. 5 tried hard to drag the big fruit and rolled towards Mu Yan.\u201cYanyan, Yanyan, come back to your senses quickly.\u201d No. 5 cried anxiously.It was only then that Mu Yan came back to his senses, and then saw\u2026 a big corn was rolling on the ground, and No. 5\u2019s body was completely covered by the corn.Mu Yan stepped forward and picked up the corn, revealing No. 5\u2019s chubby body, and then carefully looked at the corn in his hand.The yellowish white coat is wrapped layer by layer, with long ears of corn, and the golden corn kernels inside are exposed when the coat is pulled away. Yes, it is exactly the same as the corn in the previous life, but\u2026But the corn here does not grow in the ground, but on the trees, like apples and peaches, hanging on the branches one by one, which is why Mu Yan was in a daze when he first saw it. .If one ignores its origin, Mu Yan would definitely be happy to have found the corn, but now, he is not sure whether the familiar corn in his hands is really as edible as it was in his previous life. Corn on the tree.Mu Yan is very entangled. He likes to eat corn. Whether it is boiled, roasted, or porridge, it is very delicious. He couldn\u2019t determine whether the corn was poisonous or not, and whether it could be eaten.Alas\u2026 It would be great if the system was upgraded soon, so that it can be identified.\u201cYanyan, is this edible? Is it delicious?\u201d Number five is most concerned about this.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious, but all the corn I know grows in the ground, and this is the first time I\u2019ve seen it grow on a tree, so I\u2019m not sure if I can eat it.\u201d Mu Yan said truthfully.\u201cHow about\u2026 let\u2019s try?\u201d Number Five suggested weakly.\u201cForget it, after you upgrade, let\u2019s come to appraise it again.\u201d After finishing speaking, after seeing No. 5 wilting at a speed visible to the naked eye, Mu Yan hurriedly comforted him: \u201cAt that time, I will make boiled corn, grilled corn, etc. Corn and polenta are delicious.\u201dNumber Five: \u2026Is Yan Yan comforting it?Are you really comforting it?Why does it feel that Yanyan is simply tempting to attack it?It is a kind of torture to not be able to eat so many delicious foods now!As a result, Number Five became even more depressed.Mu Yan was very puzzled, he was clearly comforting No. 5, why did he feel that No. 5 had become more depressed? What went wrong?\u201cHow about\u2026 let\u2019s take one home for a try?\u201d Mu Yan asked flatteringly, he didn\u2019t like seeing No. 5 like this.No. 5 was immediately moved by Mu Yan, but he also knew that what Mu Yan said was correct. Although he really wanted to taste the taste of corn, he was also a good system that was considerate, gentle and considerate. How could it make the host It\u2019s hard not to be happy.So, No. 5 waved his hand and said very proudly: \u201cNo need, let\u2019s find something more delicious than this.\u201dSeeing that No. 5 finally recovered, Mu Yan also felt relieved, with a small smile on his face again, and one person and one system continued to embark on the journey of searching for food.At this moment, there was a sudden \u201cbang\u201d sound, and even the ground under his feet shook a few times, and Mu Yan\u2019s face suddenly turned pale.\u201cGod is angry, God is angry.\u201d Mu Yan murmured fearfully.In the previous life, Ah God also got angry several times. Every time Ah God got angry, the village would suffer, either the land was flooded or drought, or the back mountain collapsed and the ground trembled, just like the current situation, every time Many people will die.So now he is going to die\u2026People in ancient times were full of reverence for God, and in their view, many natural disasters were caused by God being angry, so they sent down punishment.Unlike Mu Yan from the feudal era, No. 5 is from the high-tech era, and naturally he is not so superstitious about natural disasters, so his first reaction was, \u201cAn earthquake?\u201dBut soon Number Five threw this possibility out of his mind, because if it was really an earthquake, it wouldn\u2019t stop after shaking a few times.\u201cYanyan, wait here, I\u2019ll go see what\u2019s going on?\u201d No. 5 said to Mu Yan, not noticing the other\u2019s pale face.Number five flew very fast and came back in a minute.\u201cYanyan, Yanyan, a mecha fell down in front, there should be someone in it, maybe he was injured.\u201d No. 5 told Mu Yan what he saw.\u201cWhat?\u201d Mu Yan still hadn\u2019t reacted from God\u2019s anger.\u201cJust now the earthquake was not an earthquake, but a person fell from the sky, but he didn\u2019t know if he was dead or not,\u201d said No. 5.\u201cHuman? Is anyone injured?\u201d Mu Yan finally heard what No. 5 said. Although he couldn\u2019t understand the mech or something, he knew that it wasn\u2019t the vibration caused by God\u2019s anger, so he relaxed a lot. However, the next moment when he heard that someone was injured, his heart was raised again.\u201cI don\u2019t know, but when it fell from the sky, the mecha was smashed to pieces, and I\u2019m afraid people are not much better.\u201d No. 5 shrugged and said, if it had shoulders.\u201cLet\u2019s go over and have a look.\u201d Mu Yan was a little worried. If someone was really injured and didn\u2019t treat him, he might die.For Mu Yan, who grew up in a relatively simple village, human life is very, very important.No. 5 took Mu Yan to the scene of the accident, and saw a mess from a distance, a huge mech fell to pieces, many parts collapsed everywhere, Mu Yan, who saw the mecha for the first time, even It was shocking, and even the world view was refreshed again.However, Mu Yan didn\u2019t pay much attention to the huge mecha that he had never seen before, because there was a **** man lying not far from the mecha.Mu Yan looked timidly at the **** man, who wanted to move forward, but felt scared. He had never seen such a scene. In a village, at most, he would suffer a little injury. This was the first time that he almost became a blood man.\u201cYanyan, he\u2019s still alive.\u201d Number five\u2019s voice sounded, and it went to investigate, and found that the man was still alive although he was seriously injured.Hearing this, Mu Yan took a deep breath, tried hard to suppress the fear in his heart, and moved towards the person lying on the ground step by step. There was fear in his eyes, but more firmness.That was a human life, no matter what, he didn\u2019t want a human life to die quietly before his eyes like this.Mu Yan squatted next to the man, tremblingly stretched out his small hand to reach under the man\u2019s nose, although his breath was very weak, at least he was still alive.The clothes this man was wearing had been cut into countless pieces, and the scars on his body were clearly visible, and some of the wounds were even deep enough to reveal the bone. The first thing to do now is to help him clean the wound, otherwise he might be infected when he carries it back. .\u201cNo. 5, you watch him here. I\u2019ll go to the river to get some water.\u201d Mu Yan told No. 5, and then ran towards the river at the fastest speed.After soaking the handkerchief on his body in the river, washing it, and pinching it dry, he filled his kettle with water again, and Mu Yan ran back to the man as fast as he could.Mu Yan, who usually lacks exercise, was out of breath and suffered from chest pains, but he didn\u2019t care about these things.If you want to clean the man\u2019s wound, you need to remove the man\u2019s clothes, Mu Yan looked at this man who couldn\u2019t see his face clearly, and his little face suddenly turned red.In any case, men in this world are all men, but he is a brother, or an unmarried man. If it is in their world, after seeing the man\u2019s body, he will marry him, otherwise his innocence It\u2019s all ruined.Mu Yan took a deep breath again, and told himself secretly in his heart, this is another world, the most important thing is to save people now, and the rest will be discussed later.After making a hint in his heart, Mu Yan gently removed the clothes on the injured man, and used the handkerchief to help him clean up the dirt on the wound, trying to focus on the wound instead of looking at the strong waist of the man.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Probably because he hurt the other person while cleaning the wound, the man grunted from time to time, but there was no sign of waking up.After cleaning the injured man\u2019s wounds, Mu Yan dabbed some water on the man\u2019s chapped lips. The next step is to take the man back to the village and find a doctor for treatment.Mu Yan looked at the man\u2019s tall body and compared it to his own. He was very worried that he couldn\u2019t carry him on his back, but he still had to try anyway, and the facts showed\u2026he really couldn\u2019t carry a strong man.\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Mu Yan\u2019s eyes were red with anxiety.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was to attract wild beasts, and when he came back, he might see a pair of bones.Moreover, he has already traveled a long way to find more ingredients, and now it will take a lot of time to go back, and he doesn\u2019t know if the man can last until then.Mu Yan pursed his lips tightly, his small face full of determination, he looked around, then found two thick branches, and then found some soft vines, shuttled back and forth between the two branches, and soon weaved a Simple support, and spread a layer of soft hay on the support.After doing this, Mu Yan struggled to drag the injured man onto the support, tied a strong vine to one end of the support, straddled his shoulders, and dragged the whole support forward with all his strength.Although Mu Yan often does rough and heavy work at home, he has never pulled a person who is almost twice his own weight forward like now. Every step is extremely difficult, and sweat is constantly condensed into beads from his forehead. The cheeks slipped down, and the shoulders that were tightly strangled by the vines were even more painful. The skin might have been worn away, but Mu Yan didn\u2019t give up, he didn\u2019t even cry out, he just kept moving forward.If he couldn\u2019t move anymore, Mu Yan would stop and rest for a while, check the wound of the injured man, feed him a little water, and then continue to drag the brace forward.Later, Mu Yan felt that his shoulders were dull and he lost all feeling, and his legs didn\u2019t seem to belong to him, so he could only move forward mechanically.On the way back, Mu Yan spent almost twice as long as when he came, and it was already late at night when he returned to the village. If he hadn\u2019t been supported by a breath of energy, he might have been unable to hold on.Mu Yan is afraid of the dark, but at the moment he only has the thought of \u201cwe must save people\u201d, and he completely ignores the darkness.No. 5 followed Mu Yan quietly along the way, and didn\u2019t make trouble by chirping.When passing by the door of his house, Mu Yan put down the stand, then staggered to the door of Lin Jiayu\u2019s house and knocked on the door.If it was normal, he would definitely not come here to disturb others at this time, but now the situation is urgent, he can\u2019t think of anyone else to ask for help except Lin Jiayu and Yang Wenyao, and the man\u2019s injury can\u2019t be delayed any longer.Fortunately, Yang Wenyao and Lin Jiayu didn\u2019t blame Mu Yan for disturbing their dreams at this time, but when they saw Mu Yan in distress, they were full of worry.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you injured?\u201d Seeing that Mu Yan\u2019s body was covered with blood, and even his shoulder was still bleeding, Lin Jiayu asked in surprise and worry.\u201cAunt Lin, I\u2019m fine. There are people in my family\u2026\u201d Mu Yan said anxiously, hoping that Uncle Yang could help. He couldn\u2019t even move.Yang Wenyao didn\u2019t ask any specific questions. Seeing that Mu Yan was in such a hurry, without further ado, he immediately supported Mu Yan and asked Lin Jiayu to take care of the child at home, while he went to see what happened.On the way, Mu Yan briefly told Yang Wenyao what happened in the forest. After returning to his door, Mu Yan couldn\u2019t hold on any longer and fell down. His legs were trembling uncontrollably. He couldn\u2019t control it at all. live.Yang Wenyao already knew what happened. After seeing the wounds on the injured man, he first carried Mu Yan to the bed in the room, and then dragged the injured man in. Both of them healed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It would be even better if there was a healing chamber.It\u2019s a pity that this is a backward planet. Not to mention healing instruments, there are not even worse healing tools. You must use the healing methods used by the primitive ancestors, such as applying medicine, taking medicine, applying externally and taking it internally. The time will also be longer.After the doctor checked the man, he said: \u201cThere are many wounds on his body, and the internal injuries are also serious. Whether he can survive it depends on these two days. As long as he can wake up in these two days, then he will be fine. If If you can\u2019t wake up, then\u2026\u201dThe doctor didn\u2019t finish his sentence, but everyone understood what he had to say.\u201cThank you, Dr. Li.\u201d Yang Wenyao thanked, and then sent Dr. Li to leave.\u201cDon\u2019t be sad, we have done everything we can.\u201d As for whether the injured man can survive it depends on himself, Yang Wenyao comforted Mu Yan.Mu Yan also knows that the next thing is to rely on the man himself, but he still hopes that the man can survive.Seeing a strange tall man lying in Mu Yan\u2019s house, Yang Wenyao was a little worried. Although he was injured now, this man was not easy to mess with.Moreover, he was wearing a military uniform, even though it was already in tatters, but he still recognized it. Can such a person stay at the young man\u2019s house, can he really rest assured? What if he came to his senses and did something to Mu Yan?Yang Wenyao thought for a while, and said to Mu Yan, \u201cYanyan, you stay at home alone, why don\u2019t you send him to the hospital in the village, so that he will receive better care.\u201dMu Yan looked at the injured man, and knew that Uncle Yang\u2019s suggestion was the most suitable, but for some reason, he didn\u2019t want to send it over.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I have nothing to do at home. I can take good care of him. There are not many doctors in the village, and there are many other patients, too busy.\u201d Mu Yan said.Although there is a hospital in the village, the scale of the hospital is not large, and there are only two or three doctors. Usually, everyone will go there if they have a small cold or injury.Yang Wenyao didn\u2019t say anything when he saw this, he just wanted to take some time to come and see him every day. Anyway, this man was still seriously injured, and he wouldn\u2019t recover for a while. Even if he was sober, he might be powerless to do anything.So, the injured man temporarily stayed at Mu Yan\u2019s house.After resting for a day, Mu Yan\u2019s legs have regained consciousness. Although they are still a little trembling and weak when walking, they can recover after resting. Because the shoulders have worn a large piece of skin, they have already applied medicine. It hurts sharply.For the past two days, Mu Yan did not go to the forest to look for ingredients, but concentrated on taking care of the injured man at home, helping him change and apply medicine, and cooking the leftover mushrooms into soup, feeding him carefully .Number five watched the unconscious man eating the mushrooms that belonged to him, and felt a little resentment in his heart, but soon these resentments disappeared, because\u2026\u201cNo. 5, these are for you.\u201d Mu Yan handed the other bowl to No. 5.No. 5 looked at the bowl full of mushrooms and was very satisfied. Although the man could be fed by his own hands, he could only drink soup, and he still had to eat mushrooms. Sure enough, Yanyan still liked it the most. it\u2019s gone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The scalding temperature He was so frightened that he immediately jumped up and ran to Dr. Li\u2019s house without looking back.The doctor examined the injured man and said, \u201cIt\u2019s an inflammation of the wound that caused the fever. Give him these medicines, and then wipe him properly to cool down.\u201d\u201cOkay, thank you Dr. Li.\u201d Mu Yan thanked obediently.After sending Dr. Li away, Mu Yan immediately gave the man antipyretics, and then thought that what Dr. Li said could also quickly cool down by rubbing his body, a blush and a tangle appeared on his little face.He hopes that the man can survive, but the other party is a man, he is a brother, men and women can\u2019t kiss each other, it\u2019s a last resort to clean his wound for the first time, but now\u2026Now that he has a fever, if the fever doesn\u2019t go down, the infection may worsen, and maybe he will never be able to save him again. Thinking of this, Mu Yan tried hard to tell himself that this is a last resort, he is just saving people.Even though he gave himself psychological hints, Mu Yan\u2019s little face still blushed involuntarily when he saw that handsome face.He had never seen such a good-looking man, not even the best-looking man in the village, no, even the town, if such a man were with them, he would definitely be very popular with him.Mu Yan shook his head vigorously, tried his best to get rid of the distracting thoughts in his mind, let himself calm down, then tilted his head to one side, and carefully opened the other party\u2019s skirt, intending to just hold the wet handkerchief and give it to the other party. He wiped his body to cool down, so he didn\u2019t notice that the originally closed eyes had already opened at this moment, a light flashed in the dark and deep eyes, and then they closed again.After wiping the other person\u2019s body with difficulty, Mu Yan was covered in sweat. After taking a shower, he soaked himself in a bowl of nutrition powder to wrap himself in his stomach. Finally, he came to check on the injured man\u2019s condition before going back to his room to rest. up.In fact, nutrition powder is still a very good thing. It is very convenient to use in the current situation. Whether it is an injured man or a tired man who doesn\u2019t want to cook, he only needs to soak a packet and he will not be hungry at all. .Probably because of a tiring day, Mu Yan fell into a sweet dream on the bed, but in the room next door to him, the injured man opened his eyes again, the deepness in his eyes had long since disappeared, and there was a hint of confusion instead. , like a newborn who just came to this world, full of confusion about everything around him.His mind was blank, except for the figure that he occasionally saw soberly during the day, and the voice that always appeared faintly in his ears these days, there was nothing.Who is he? from where? Where is this again? He didn\u2019t know it all, he didn\u2019t have an answer.The man tilted his head slightly and looked around. There were strangers everywhere. It stands to reason that a person with no memory would always feel uneasy and flustered in an unfamiliar environment. However, he miraculously did not. Instead, he felt Very relieved, as if he should be here in the first place.Probably because the injuries on his body hadn\u2019t healed yet, the man didn\u2019t wake up for a long time, and soon fell asleep again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just taking some small pills can make the fever go away. You must know that in their world, there are not a few people who died due to wind-cold and fever. If they can also have such a magical little pill, will they Many people survived.Mu Yan didn\u2019t think about it for too long. After all, he would never go back to that world. That world has no connection with him. He will work hard to live in this world in the future.Although the man\u2019s fever has subsided, the wound on his body is still there, and the medicine needs to be changed every day. He is the only one here, and he is embarrassed to always trouble Uncle Yang. After all, Uncle Yang and Aunt Lin still have to go to work, it is very hard of.The first time he was born and the second time he was acquainted, Mu Yan skillfully unbuttoned the man\u2019s clothes, revealing his bandage-covered body. Although his face was still slightly flushed, he was no longer as nervous as the first time, his hands were trembling and his heart was beating wildly.\u201cHuh?\u201d Mu Yan looked at the wound exposed under the bandage, and he was surprised, only to see that the deep bone wound had healed faintly, while other abrasions or small wounds had already scabbed, and even some Shedding revealed newborn tender pink skin.This person\u2019s wound healed so quickly, and he was fine in just a few days. This world is really amazing.Mu Yan once again felt the magic of this world. In the past, this kind of wound would take a few months of cultivation to heal, but now there is no major problem in a few days. As long as people can wake up, basically everything will be fine. .\u201cWake up quickly, you\u2019ll be fine when you wake up.\u201d Mu Yan said to himself while carefully applying medicine to the man\u2019s wound.As if hearing Mu Yan\u2019s prayer, the man who had his eyes closed suddenly opened his eyes, and those dark and deep eyes revealed a trace of confusion and dependence.Mu Yan finished applying the medicine to the man, put on the bandage again, tidied up and planned to make a bowl of nutritional powder to satisfy the man\u2019s hunger, but when he turned around, he saw those dark eyes staring straight at him, he was shocked immediately Jumping, everything in his hands fell to the ground in an instant, Mu Yan was more like a frightened rabbit, with a frightened expression on his face.The man seemed to be a little anxious, anxiousness flashed in his bright black eyes, struggling to sit up, his outstretched hands seemed to want to grab Mu Yan.\u201cYou still have wounds on your body, don\u2019t move yet.\u201d Seeing this, Mu Yan was afraid that the man would move too much and burst open the wound that had finally begun to heal, so he hurriedly stepped forward to grab the man\u2019s fidgeting hands, Forget the fear I had just now.\u201cIt would be great if you wake up, so you won\u2019t die.\u201d Mu Yan thought of this, and immediately laughed happily. Before, he was worried that the man would not be able to wake up, but now everyone is awake. In addition, the wound healed quickly, I believe that the man will be able to heal and move freely soon.\u201cWhere am I?\u201d the man asked, but his eyes never moved away from Mu Yan.\u201cThis is Peach Blossom Village, I found you in the forest.\u201d Mu Yan replied, always feeling that these words sound familiar.\u201cPeach Blossom Village?\u201d The man murmured in a low voice, his mind went blank, and he couldn\u2019t find any information related to Peach Blossom Village, and he didn\u2019t even know who he was, where he came from, and why he was here.None of that matters to the man now, though, who feels comfortable being here, especially around this man.Probably because this person has been taking care of me, and he was the first person I saw when I woke up. I always feel that this person is very kind.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, and where is your home? Your injury is about to heal, so it\u2019s better to call your family to pick you up.\u201d Mu Yan asked, tilting his head.However, the man shook his head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know where my home is, and I don\u2019t know what my name is. I\u2026I can\u2019t remember.\u201dMu Yan was very surprised when he heard this, it was the first time he encountered such a situation, he turned around and ran outside without thinking.The man lying on the bed saw Mu Yan running out with a frightened (not) expression on his face, his heart skipped a beat, a strange and flustered emotion slowly spread from the bottom of his heart, making him breathless, Not to be hurt, he immediately got up from the bed and chased him out, always feeling that if he didn\u2019t chase him out, he would never see this boy again.Mu Yan didn\u2019t think much about it at all, he just wanted to find Uncle Yang or Dr. Li to come over and see what happened to this man, how could he not even remember who he was.Mu Yan was also considered lucky. Just as he left the door, he ran into Yang Wenyao with Haohao and Yingying. Seeing this, Yang Wenyao hurriedly asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cYang, Uncle Yang, he\u2019s awake, but he, he doesn\u2019t remember anything.\u201d Mu Yan was out of breath because of running too fast, and he spoke slowly and stammered.\u201cI\u2019ll go take a look with you.\u201d Yang Wenyao said immediately after hearing the words. He had originally planned to come and take a look.Mu Yan led Yang Wenyao back, and then saw a bandaged man standing at the door, staring at Mu Yan closely, as if he had been abandoned, his eyes were full of grievances, and he looked pitiful of.\u201cWhy are you up?\u201d Mu Yan ran over in a hurry and checked carefully, fearing that the wound on the other party\u2019s body might be ruptured, he was relieved to see that the bandage did not ooze blood.\u201cHi, I\u2019m Yang Wenyao, I heard Yan Yan said, you don\u2019t remember anything?\u201d Yang Wenyao asked very straightforwardly.\u201cEn.\u201d The man responded lightly, looked at Yang Wenyao warily, stepped forward faintly, and blocked Mu Yan behind him, with a very strong vigilance, which he did not have when facing Mu Yan.Seeing this, Yang Wenyao frowned slightly.\u201cDon\u2019t you even remember your name, home address, and family members?\u201d Yang Wenyao asked again, keeping his eyes on the man, trying to judge whether he was lying by observing his expression.The man shook his head, saying that he really didn\u2019t remember anything.\u201cTo be on the safe side, let Dr. Li come and have a look.\u201d Yang Wenyao said, and asked Mu Yan to invite Dr. Li.Mu Yan raised his leg to go over, but found that his sleeve was grabbed by someone, looking up along the slender fingers, the man was holding his sleeve tightly, looking at him with a stubborn expression.\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d Mu Yan promised, although he didn\u2019t know why he said this to the man, but he always felt that the man just wanted to hear him say that.The man pursed his thin lips tightly, and finally let go of his sleeves reluctantly, watching Mu Yan leave until he could no longer see him.In the absence of Mu Yan, the aura on the man\u2019s body was wide open, and he showed no intention of restraining and controlling him.Yang Wenyao was startled, he adjusted himself hastily, and the way he looked at the man became more cautious and complicated.It\u2019s not that he hasn\u2019t seen a man with a natural aura before, but he didn\u2019t expect to meet him in such a small village. The identity of this man may not be simple.But such a person has lost his memory, and he doesn\u2019t know whether it is good or bad for him.And judging from the observation just now, this man seems to be a little dependent on Mu Yan, probably because of the fledgling plot, Mu Yan saved him, and the first person he saw when he woke up was Mu Yan, so he subconsciously Relying on Mu Yan, wanting to get closer.\u201cYour identity may not be simple, don\u2019t you want to get back your family?\u201d Yang Wenyao asked.The man didn\u2019t answer immediately, his eyes became much deeper, and the temperature around him dropped a lot, as if he was thinking about something.It is impossible to say that he is not curious about his past, but when he thinks that if he recovers his memory, he will leave this place and that person, he subconsciously resists.The man himself is a relatively casual person. Since he doesn\u2019t want to leave here or that person for the time being, he is not in a hurry to find the memory. It seems good to let the memory recover naturally.\u201cI don\u2019t remember them.\u201d The man replied lightly, implying that I don\u2019t remember, so I can\u2019t find them, so there is no need to look for them.\u201cLooking at your temperament and behavior, it is very likely that you are not from our planet. If you leave here, you may easily find your family, but here, you may not be able to find them in your lifetime.\u201d Yang Wenyao said.\u201cBut the first thing I find when I go out may be my enemy.\u201d The man replied calmly.Although he has no memory, but he landed on such a planet, his body is full of injuries, and\u2026The man put his hands on his abdomen unconsciously, and it was empty there. Although he didn\u2019t remember it, he always felt that there should be something there, but now there is nothing there.Moreover, he has lost his memory so badly that the possibility of accidents causing such a situation is relatively small, and the possibility of vendetta is greater.Yang Wenyao was speechless after hearing this, he had to say that the other party was very sensible, and what he said made sense, but letting him stay here, especially seeing how he wanted to stay at Yan Yan\u2019s house, no matter how you looked at it, it was all wrong. A dangerous thing.Probably seeing Yang Wenyao\u2019s worry, it was rare for the man to take the initiative to say, \u201cI won\u2019t hurt him.\u201dThere is only that one figure and one voice in his blank mind. For him now, that person is everything to him, so how could he possibly hurt him.Yang Wenyao still wanted to say something to the man, but out of the corner of his eye, he caught sight of Dr. Li and Mu Yan rushing over, and swallowed the words again.\u201cDad, Dr. Li is here.\u201d Yingying came back first to report after trotting all the way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The skin trauma is no longer a serious problem, and the internal injury should not affect his life after a period of recuperation.\u201d Dr. Li said.\u201cThank you, Dr. Li.\u201d Mu Yan thanked obediently.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, the previous medicine will continue to be used. If there is nothing else, then I will take my leave first.\u201d Dr. Li said.\u201cYanyan, go see Dr. Li off, and you two, go with Yanyan.\u201d Yang Wenyao said to Mu Yan and the two children, he still had something to say to this man.Mu Yan obediently took two little Doudings to send Dr. Li out. Yang Wenyao looked at the man lying on the bed with a solemn and serious expression, and said in a cold voice: \u201cYour life was saved by Yan Yan. I hope you can keep in mind that if you decide to live here, then you must ensure that your words are not hurt, otherwise, this village will never welcome you!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me, I will protect him well.\u201d The man looked at Yang Wenyao without any fear, and made his promise word by word. Even if Yang Wenyao didn\u2019t say anything, he would do the same. He would not allow others to hurt to that boy.\u201cIt\u2019s best like this.\u201d Yang Wenyao bit the bullet and looked at the man, almost being suppressed by the man\u2019s aura.If there is a third person present at this moment, you will definitely feel the silent duel between these two powerful men, and it looks evenly matched, but that is only on the surface. Only Yang Wenyao knows how much courage and perseverance he has used to succeed He didn\u2019t let himself avert his gaze.He has a new understanding of the strength of the man in front of him, but every time he gets to know him again, his mood will become more complicated, and he doesn\u2019t know whether it is the right choice to keep this man, but he knows that if the man really He couldn\u2019t stop him from wanting to stay, and with Yan Yan\u2019s personality, he would definitely accept it. The only thing he could do now was to beat this man up, hoping that he wouldn\u2019t hurt Yan Yan.When Mu Yan brought the two children in, the atmosphere in the room rose instantly, as if the tit-for-tat confrontation before was an illusion.\u201cYanyan, he will stay in the village for the time being. Do you want to let him live with you temporarily, or find another place for him to live in? There are still many vacant houses in the village.\u201d Yang Wenyao asked.Anyone with a little money has moved out of the village, so there are still quite a lot of vacant houses in the village.After hearing Yang Wenyao\u2019s words, the man glared at him viciously, but Yang Wenyao pretended not to see it.\u201cI want to live here.\u201d The man said this to Mu Yan.Mu Yan is a little entangled, he likes the person in front of him very much, if he stays, it would be good to be his companion, since he came to this world, he has been alone all the time, although he has met Aunt Lin and Yang Uncle, but they also have their own family, not to mention that the other party was saved by themselves, so they are a little close psychologically.But the other party is a man, but he is a brother. An unmarried brother living with a man will always cause gossip, although no one in this world knows this.\u201cYanyan, don\u2019t agree, don\u2019t agree.\u201d No. 5, relying on the fact that no one else could see it, circled fidgetily above Mu Yan\u2019s head.The man seemed to see Mu Yan\u2019s hesitation, he was a little anxious, and added: \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone else here except you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If you live alone under such circumstances, I am afraid it will be even more sad, even more lonely than him alone.Anyway, there is no such thing as a brother in this world, as long as he doesn\u2019t tell, no one will know that he is a brother, and his gender in this world is the same as that of a man, so when they live together, no one should gossip That\u2019s right, Mu Yan comforted himself in his heart, and finally nodded, agreeing that the man should stay.The man finally breathed a sigh of relief, and a faint smile appeared on his paralyzed face.\u201cYanyan, you\u2019ve been cheated.\u201d No. 5 said angrily, dissatisfied with Mu Yan\u2019s ignoring himself, but he had no choice but to stare at the man viciously, but unfortunately he couldn\u2019t see it at all.Seeing that the matter here was settled, Yang Wenyao took the two children and left Mu Yan\u2019s house, leaving the two soon-to-be roommates to cultivate their relationship.Seeing the man staring straight at him, Mu Yan\u2019s originally relaxed mood suddenly became tense, his face was slightly hot, and he stammered, \u201cYou\u2026 you should rest for a while, I\u2019ll go make nutrition powder.\u201dAfter finishing speaking, Mu Yan ran out as if escaping, and didn\u2019t notice the slight curve of the man\u2019s mouth.\u201cYanyan, how can you keep him here?\u201d No. 5 followed behind Muyan, and said in a sullen tone.It has been following Yan Yan all the time, but since he came back after saving that man, Yan Yan has almost never looked at it directly, all his heart is on that man, and sometimes he even ignores himself directly, which is simply too much, that What\u2019s so good about a man, isn\u2019t it just a nose and two eyes? If there\u2019s anything worth paying attention to, it\u2019s not as useful as it is.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t remember anything, and he doesn\u2019t know anyone except me, so he will definitely be uneasy if he is outside.\u201d Mu Yan replied in a soft voice while brewing nutrition powder.\u201cBut what can he do? He can only eat rice all day long.\u201d No. 5 yelled dissatisfied, trying to discredit someone in front of Mu Yan.\u201cHe\u2026\u201d When Mu Yan thought of the toned muscles he accidentally saw when he wiped the man\u2019s body and changed his dressing, his face turned a little red, and he said hastily, \u201cHe can help us farm in the future.\u201dA man is a man. In their place, it is generally a man who farms and contributes. Maybe\u2026 maybe he will help him in the future, right?Seeing Mu Yan like this, No. 5 was very depressed, and flew to the corner alone, wanting to go quietly, while Mu Yan returned to the room where the man was with nutrition powder.\u201cHere you are.\u201d Mu Yan handed over the bowl. Before the man was unconscious, he fed it little by little.

Obviously, he did not expect that the name Mu Yan should give him was exactly the same as he thought.\u201cIsn\u2019t this name nice?\u201d Seeing the other party\u2019s surprised look, Mu Yan didn\u2019t say a word for a long time, thinking that the other party didn\u2019t like it, and he felt a little depressed. This was something he decided after thinking for a long time. If the other party didn\u2019t like it, He still has to think about it.\u201cWhy did you choose this name?\u201d the man asked, with a hint of expectation in his expression.\u201cWell\u2026 Uncle Yang said that you fell from the universe. There are many beautiful stars in the universe. I originally wanted to name you Muyu or Muzhou, but they are not as good as Muchen.\u201d Mu Yan explained.When Mu Yan described to Yang Wenyao the process of saving the man and what he saw, Yang Wenyao had already guessed, so he told Mu Yan about it. Mu Yan is a waste of names, so he planned to use the man\u2019s \u201csource\u201d to name him. Only then did Mu Chen come into existence.\u201cThis name is very good, thank you, I like it very much.\u201d Mu Chen said with a smile, his originally handsome face became even more dazzling because of the smile, which made Mu Yan stunned for a moment.After reacting, Mu Yan\u2019s small face suddenly turned red, he waved his hands hastily, and stammered, \u201cNo, you\u2019re welcome, as long as you, you like it.\u201dHe actually stared straight at a man, and he was dumbfounded. It was really shameful. If it was in the past, he would definitely be pointed out.But Ash is so pretty.\u201cThen, then you will be called Mu Chen from now on, then I will call you A Chen.\u201d Mu Yan said with his eyes slightly bright.In this world, he also has his first family.\u201cEn.\u201d The man nodded, with a pampering smile in his eyes.He didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with the past for the time being, but since the young man gave him the name Mu Chen, it must be due to fate. If so, let\u2019s call him Mu Chen, as long as the other party is happy.Mu Yan is very happy that he is finally no longer alone. Although the other party is a man, he tries his best to make himself forget this, and try his best to stop towards this world. Of course, if the other party can fall in love with him in the process of getting along with him own words\u2026When Mu Yan thinks of establishing a small family in the future, his heart is full, and his happiness is about to overflow.As a brother, Mu Yan\u2019s desire to find a man who loves him and have a baby has not been dispelled because of the change of the world, but he will not force it.

His upgrade task hadn\u2019t been finished yet, and he didn\u2019t go there these few days because he had to take care of Mu Chen. Now The other party is much better, at least he can take care of himself, so naturally he can\u2019t delay any longer.Mu Yan put the prepared nutrition powder and hot water beside Mu Chen\u2019s bed, and carefully told him: \u201cIf you are hungry, make the nutrition powder by yourself. Although the wound on your body is almost healed, it is still not enough. You need to change your medicine regularly, and remember to take your medicine at one o\u2019clock in the afternoon\u2026\u201dMu Chen really enjoyed the feeling of being cared by Mu Yan. When he first listened to Mu Yan\u2019s careful instructions, his expression was very happy, but the more he listened, the more he felt something was wrong. Why did it feel like Mu Yan was going to leave so he was arranging for him?\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Mu Chen sat up and asked, staring straight at Mu Yan, his thin lips were slightly pursed, his expression was dignified, and there was a trace of tension that he didn\u2019t even notice.\u201cI want to find something to eat in the forest.\u201d Mu Yan replied truthfully.food? Isn\u2019t what you eat is nutritional powder? Why go to the forest to find it? Mu Chen was very puzzled, but he didn\u2019t show it, but said directly: \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201dMu Chen was about to get out of bed and change clothes, Mu Yan hurriedly stopped him when he saw this, \u201cYou haven\u2019t recovered yet, so you can\u2019t go out.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m worried about you going to the forest alone.\u201d Mu Chen stubbornly wanted to get out of bed, and Mu Yan was also a little at a loss.Although the injury on the opponent\u2019s body recovered very well and quickly, it only took a few days, and he hadn\u2019t fully recovered. If he really went out, it might get worse.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I used to go alone, there is no danger, I don\u2019t go to deep places.\u201d Mu Yan said hastily, wanting the other party to rest assured.However, Mu Yan\u2019s words had the opposite effect. Not only did Mu Chen not feel at ease when he heard the words, but he was even more determined to go with Mu Yan, which was also mixed with heartache.As long as he thinks of such a thin Muyan running around in the dangerous forest for food alone, his heart can\u2019t help but twitch, stinging and stinging.\u201cI\u2019ll go with you, I\u2019m not at ease.\u201d Mu Chen had already got out of bed, untied the clothes he was wearing, and prepared to change into a set of going out clothes that Yang Wenyao brought him.Seeing this, Mu Yan\u2019s eyes widened slightly, his little face immediately flushed red, he covered his face with his hands, and turned his back, the heat on his face didn\u2019t dissipate for a long time.He\u2026 how could he take off his clothes in public, didn\u2019t he know he was here too? If it was in their time, this would ruin my brother\u2019s reputation, then don\u2019t think that other people will marry this brother in the future, then my brother can only marry him.But Mu Yan thought about it, this is another world, Mu Chen didn\u2019t know that he was a brother at all, maybe he thought he was of the same sex, it seemed normal to change clothes in front of the same sex.In that case, is it normal for him to see it? Mu Yan couldn\u2019t help thinking in his heart that Mu Chen\u2019s movements were too fast just now, and he didn\u2019t even realize it. After he took off his shirt, he just wanted to cover his face and turn around. Before that, he seemed to have spotted a little bit of strong muscle.While thinking about it, Mu Yan endured his blushing and heat and quietly turned around again. His hands were still covering his face, but the gap between his fingers was slowly expanding. His eyes were fixed on Mu Chen\u2019s strong waist and smooth muscles.Hmm\u2026 Mu Yan felt his face was burning, he was so hot that he was about to gasp.This is the first time he has seen a man\u2019s body. Originally, the man was much taller and mightier than his brother, but he did not expect to look like this after taking off his clothes. Such a strong and strong waist must be very powerful. At times like this\u2026Ah, what is he thinking, he is a brother, and he wants to be a man here, it\u2019s just\u2026 It\u2019s so embarrassing! Mu Yan\u2019s little face is completely red, if it is represented by an anime image, Mu Yan\u2019s face at this moment must be as red as an apple, and there will be misty water vapor from the top of his head.Although Mu Chen was changing clothes, his eyes and attention were always on Mu Yan\u2019s body, so he saw Mu Yan\u2019s reaction from beginning to end, and the corners of his cold mouth couldn\u2019t help but curl up slightly.Mu Chen tried his best to press down the corners of his upturned lips, pretending to be worried, and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Have you got a fever? Why are you so red?\u201dAs he said that, Mu Chen still wanted to step forward to test the temperature of the other party, but Mu Yan\u2019s little face turned redder, his body couldn\u2019t help shrinking back, and his heart was beating wildly, it was almost unbearable. About to jump out of the chest.\u201cI, I\u2019m fine, just, just a little, a little hot.\u201d Mu Yan stammered nervously.No. 5 flew in mid-air, seeing everything here from beginning to end, almost going to explode, his host didn\u2019t notice, but he did notice, that hateful man did it on purpose, deliberately teasing his host Yes, only his idiot host would not realize it.Damn it! No. 5 really wanted to teach Mu Chen a harsh lesson, but it couldn\u2019t be seen by anyone except the host. Even if it wanted to be taught a lesson, it had no choice but to suffocate it.Seeing that Mu Yan\u2019s whole body was about to burn, Mu Chen felt that Mu Yan was so cute, especially the little red face, which made people want to go forward and take a bite, but at the same time, he also felt Go on, maybe the other party will really spontaneously combust.Mu Chen coughed lightly, diverted his attention, and changed the subject: \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you were going to the forest? Let\u2019s go now.\u201d\u201cOh? Oh.\u201d Mu Yan replied blankly, and then rushed out the door, always feeling that he was staying, and he might not be able to resist stepping forward and throwing people down.As a brother, if he couldn\u2019t help throwing a man down, he would really be ashamed and thrown into another world.Mu Yan patted his cheek and forced himself to calm down. Didn\u2019t he just look at the other person\u2019s body? It\u2019s okay, don\u2019t think about it anymore, don\u2019t think about it anymore.Mu Yan kept hinting to himself in his heart, tried his best to get the previous picture out of his mind, so as not to let it continue to affect him, and then walked towards the forest with Mu Chen.Although Mu Chen didn\u2019t talk much, he always felt very happy chatting with him. Along the way, Mu Yan felt that time passed faster than before, but\u2026 it was just that he always felt that he seemed to have forgotten something, but what exactly had he forgotten?Number Five: \u2026Dear host, you have forgotten me, how can you forget the old love when you have a new love, it really hates the man who robbed him of the host.\u201cWhat are you looking for in the forest? I\u2019ll help you find it.\u201d Mu Chen said to Mu Yan.Although he had heard Mu Yan say that he was looking for food in the forest, he only thought he was looking for something valuable to exchange for nutrition powder.\u201cMay I help you find it? What can you help me find? Do you know mushrooms or fungus? It\u2019s a weird way to say it, but in the end it can\u2019t help you with anything.\u201d No. Mu Chen said, although Mu Chen couldn\u2019t hear it, it didn\u2019t affect him from satirizing the other party.Sure enough, it is the most useful, it knows mushrooms and fungus, and many other ingredients, so the little host must treat him better.\u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t know if there are any here, let\u2019s look for them as we walk.\u201d Mu Yan said, he didn\u2019t know how to explain the ingredients to Mu Chen. Let\u2019s introduce each other.Mu Chen didn\u2019t ask any more questions when he heard the words, but just followed the other party\u2019s side all the time, and kept vigilant around to prevent any danger.\u201cYanyan, let\u2019s go back today looking for some mushrooms and fungus. The soup is really delicious, and the rabbit meat is delicious when grilled.\u201d When No. 5 thought of the deliciousness of those things, he couldn\u2019t help but I\u2019m going to drool.\u201cOkay, if we meet, we\u2019ll pick some back, but I may not be able to catch rabbits.\u201d Mu Yan is still very self-aware of his own strength. The last time they ate rabbit meat was purely because they were lucky and met a rabbit. The injured rabbit, if he was really asked to catch the rabbit, with his small arms and legs, he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to catch it for a day.\u201cOf course I know, but don\u2019t we have a ready-made helper here? Since he wants to come to help, isn\u2019t it too useless if he doesn\u2019t do anything, and he is so tall and big, it must be no problem to beat a rabbit Yes.\u201d No. 5 tried hard to tease Mu Chen, not letting go of any chance to give Mu Chen eye drops.If Mu Chen really hits the rabbit, then it can eat the rabbit meat, and if the other party can\u2019t hit him, Yan Yan will definitely be disappointed with him, so it is still happy.Yes, it is such a witty and clever system!\u201cIt\u2019s not good, Ah Chen\u2019s injury hasn\u2019t recovered yet.\u201d Mu Yan was a little worried.\u201cThis little thing is definitely nothing to him. It won\u2019t cause any wounds. He can tell at a glance that he must be very strong.\u201d I feel that I can work hard enough, and the ability to talk nonsense with such open eyes is also at home.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk anymore? Are you tired, or should we rest here for a while?\u201d Seeing Mu Yan\u2019s absent-minded look, Mu Chen thought that the other party was tired, so he said.\u201cTch, it\u2019s obvious that he himself is tired and wants to take a rest, and he said such a high-sounding, really scheming boy.\u201d Number five said disdainfully, how could such an obvious intention be hidden from the great system of number five, it can be seen at a glance See through it all.Mu Yan ignored No. 5, because Mu Chen was by his side, so the previous conversations with No. 5 were all carried out in his mind. For a while, he even forgot that there were other people around him. Mu Yan felt very embarrassed about this .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What does this have to do with nutrition powder?\u201cLet\u2019s go back before noon. There are still some nutritional powders at home. If you want to find something, I\u2019ll come out and find it for you next time.\u201d Mu Chen said, his eyes became deeper and firmer.During the period of recuperation, Mumu must have spent a lot of money on him. According to his observation, Mumu lived alone, without relatives or parents. It must be very difficult for such a minor to live alone, and even In this way, he still kindly saved himself, and never hesitated to give himself nutrition powder, even though his life was difficult.Facing such a friendship, how could he remain calm, now that his injury is almost healed, since he has decided to live here, he should naturally be responsible for supporting the family in the future, Mumu just needs to be happy life is fine.At this moment, Mu Chen made his first resolution after losing his memory.\u201cHmph, I can\u2019t stand it after just coming out for a short while, Yan Yan, we can\u2019t spoil him, we have to find all the ingredients to upgrade quickly, so that we can have prizes and exchange some useful tools.\u201d Number Five said immediately.Mu Yan is a little tangled, on the one hand, Mu Chen is injured, and on the other hand, he is really looking forward to the upgraded system.After thinking for a while, Mu Yan finally made a decision, and said to Mu Chen, \u201cGo back and rest first, I\u2019ll be looking for a while, and I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201dMu Chen sighed softly and said, \u201cThen I will continue to accompany you.\u201d\u201cBut your injury\u2026\u201d Mu Yan is most worried about his injury now.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s all right. Didn\u2019t you see it in the morning?\u201d Mu Chen said with a wicked smile on his lips, and sure enough, he saw Mu Yan\u2019s face blushing again the next moment.\u201cAh, this bastard, he did it on purpose, he definitely did it on purpose, and he teased you again, Yan Yan, drive him away quickly.\u201d Number five was going crazy, especially seeing its innocent host Even blushing again, I felt unbearable.It\u2019s a pity that Mu Yan, who was still immersed in shyness, didn\u2019t hear what No. 5 said at all. His heart, which had finally calmed down, began to beat faster again, hitting his chest violently one after another.\u201cI, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go forward, say, maybe we will find something.\u201d Mu Yan hurriedly changed the subject, lest his shyness would be seen by the other party, and walked forward first.With a smile on the corner of Mu Chen\u2019s mouth, he followed closely behind Mu Yan.If there are people who know Mu Chen here at this moment, they will definitely feel that they have seen a fake Mu Chen, this is definitely not the Mu Chen they know, it must have been dropped by someone!This time, probably because of Mu Chen\u2019s company, Mu Yan was a little bit bolder, and went a little deeper into the forest. It was this that allowed Mu Yan to find a new and familiar ingredient \u2014 Chinese cabbage.Although I don\u2019t know why Chinese cabbage grows in the forest in this season, but I have encountered corn that can grow on trees, so it is not surprising to encounter Chinese cabbage.

No one has ever tried to eat other things in the past.Now Mu Yan pointed to a white, green and green thing and told him that it was also edible. Such words were enough to shock his notions that he had lived for so many years.If another person told him like this, he would definitely ignore it, but if this person is Mu Yan, it\u2019s another matter.\u201cIs this edible?\u201d Mu Chen pointed at the Chinese cabbage, still a little unsure. In his opinion, it\u2019s just the weeds that grow in the forest. Are weeds edible?\u201cShort hair and short knowledge.\u201d No. 5 couldn\u2019t help but sarcastically.\u201cThat\u2019s right, at noon, I\u2019ll make meat stewed cabbage for you, it\u2019s delicious, but\u2026\u201d Mu Yan said excitedly, and as he spoke, his voice became quieter again, because he waited for himself Sorry for the request.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Seeing this situation, Mu Chen knew that Mu Yan might be asking for something from him, so he asked directly in a very considerate manner.\u201cUm\u2026the stewed cabbage with meat needs meat and needs to be hunted, so\u2026 so can you help catch a rabbit or a pheasant? I\u2019ll give you more than half of what I will make.\u201d Mu Yan said in a low voice, There was a look of anticipation in his eyes.\u201cRabbit? Pheasant? That can be eaten too?\u201d Mu Chen felt that he had suffered more shocks today than all the previous ones combined. Although he didn\u2019t remember the past, he just had such a feeling.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s delicious.\u201d Mu Yan nodded his little head vigorously, Mu Chen was afraid that he would knock his little head off, so he hurriedly stretched out his hand to support it.Feeling the warmth from the opponent\u2019s big hand, Mu Yan\u2019s face flushed slightly again, and he was a little reluctant to leave.No. 5 was very conscientious and acted as an air conditioner beside him, but it was a pity that Mu Chen couldn\u2019t see him, and Mu Yan\u2019s thoughts were all on that warm big hand, so no one noticed No. 5.Number Five: \u2026I always feel that the simple host is about to be snatched away by the big bad wolf, so I\u2019m waiting online, I\u2019m in a hurry!\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll hunt for you.\u201d Mu Chen reluctantly let go of the hand holding the opponent\u2019s chin, and turned to fondling Mu Yan\u2019s hair, with the other hand behind his back, his thumb and the other Rubbing with fingers, feeling the temperature and touch left on it.Before leaving, Mu Chen looked around and felt that there would be no danger for the time being, so he said to Mu Yan: \u201cYou just wait here, I will be back soon.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Yan responded obediently.Mu Chen intends to hunt the pheasants and rabbits that Mu Yan wanted as quickly as possible. Although he doesn\u2019t remember what he was before, his skills are still there. Maybe he wasn\u2019t used to it at first, but slowly The memory of the body is restored, and it is still very easy to deal with one or two pheasants.On the other side, Mu Yan is digging hard for Chinese cabbage. There are a lot of Chinese cabbage here, and it looks like a large area, but Mu Yan doesn\u2019t plan to harvest all at once greedily. After all, Chinese cabbage is not easy to store and it is easy to spoil. dropped.Mu Yan asked No. 5 to remember the location here, so that he could dig here if he wanted to eat cabbage in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, I took this place as the center and went around to see if I could find something else.Not to mention, it really made Mu Yan make a new discovery. In a small tuft of grass, there is actually a small piece of radish growing. The green leaves exposed outside are very familiar and very pleasing to look at.Mu Yan cheerfully stepped forward to pull out a few more radishes, and the fat and white radishes were even more pleasing to look at.For today\u2019s harvest, Mu Yan feels very satisfied. In this way, there are two more ingredients for the task, and he can move forward again.If Ah Chen hunts pheasants or rabbits later, make him a cabbage stew, stir-fry radishes, and the rest can still be roasted and eaten.Mu Yan happily thought about the menu to be made later, and then asked No. 5 to look nearby to see if there was any water source.No. 5\u2019s speed has always been very fast, but this time it hasn\u2019t come back yet, Mu Chen came back first, which shows how fast he is.Mu Chen is holding a half-dead rabbit in one hand, and a wild pheasant with fluttering wings in the other hand, which seems to be full of harvest.\u201cAh Chen, you\u2019ve hunted down both the rabbit and the pheasant, that\u2019s amazing.\u201d Mu Yan looked at Mu Chen who was carrying the two wild game, his eyes twinkled with adoring little stars.\u201cYou like to eat, so I hunted more.\u201d Mu Chen said with a doting smile.Mu Yan\u2019s face became hot again uncontrollably, if No. 5 was here at this moment, he would definitely say that Mu Chen had bad intentions and ulterior motives, and tried hard to persuade Mu Yan.It\u2019s a pity that No. 5 is not here this time. When No. 5 returns, this conversation has ended.Mu Chen tied the rabbit and pheasant together to prevent them from slipping away, and then took out a few small things from his bosom.When Mu Yan saw what Mu Chen was holding, his eyes immediately became brighter.\u201cEggs? You found the eggs?\u201d Mu Yan was overwhelmed with surprise. He held the eggs in his hands and couldn\u2019t put them down.This trip has gained so much.\u201cWhen I met this pheasant, it was hatching these eggs. I thought maybe you knew what it was, so I took it together.\u201d Mu Chen said, he was very glad that he brought these eggs together at that time Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t be able to see Mu Yan\u2019s cute and lively expression.He likes to see the contented smile on Mumu\u2019s face, especially because of him.So, Mu Chen decided that whenever he encounters novel things in the future, he will find a copy for Mu Mu, maybe Mu Mu knows it and can eat it.It is also because of this decision made by Mu Chen that they can find more edible ingredients in advance and save a lot of time in the future. Of course, these are things for later.After No. 5 came back, he gave Mu Chen a regular look, and then said to Mu Yan, \u201cYanyan, there is a water source not far ahead, it\u2019s a small stream, and the surrounding area is fairly wide, let\u2019s go there.\u201d\u201cMumu, when I just came back, I stopped by to see the water source, there is one not far ahead, let\u2019s go over there.\u201dAlmost when No. 5 finished speaking, Mu Chen also spoke, and very naturally took the radish and cabbage in Mu Yan\u2019s hand.\u201cHmph, I\u2019ve already told Yanyan about the water source, you\u2019re only here now, it\u2019s too late.\u201d No. 5 proudly puffed out her small chest, and said proudly, but it\u2019s a pity that Mu Chen couldn\u2019t see it.Mu Yan thinks this is good, otherwise he would have to think of an excuse to let Mu Chen go to the front with him. With his personality, it is really hard to find an excuse, and maybe he will cheat. Now Ah Chen offered to , he was naturally happy and didn\u2019t need to think of any excuses.The two came to the creek, and the surrounding area was indeed as No. 5 said, relatively wide, very suitable for picnics.Mu Yan took the pheasant from Mu Chen and planned to go to the stream to deal with it, but Mu Chen took it back the next moment.Mu Yan looked at Mu Chen puzzled.\u201cWhat do you say, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Mu Chen said, although he didn\u2019t know what to do with the pheasant, but it would definitely be very bloody. He didn\u2019t want the child to be stained with that kind of blood, even if it was a pheasant.But Mu Yan didn\u2019t think too much about it. He thought about Ah Chen\u2019s handling of pheasants, and he\u2019s handling of radishes and cabbages.\u201cI\u2019m going to boil hot water, you put all the chicken blood first.\u201d Mu Yan said, after boiling hot water, it is much more convenient to use it to remove chicken feathers, but at the same time, problems also arise.The kitchen utensils are all in the space of No. 5. Normally, when there are only him and No. 5, they can be taken in and out at will, but now that Mu Chen doesn\u2019t know the existence of No. 5, the kitchen utensils can\u2019t be used, so the hot water can\u2019t be used. How to burn it?Moreover, it\u2019s not just the problem of hot water, the cabbage stew and fried radish that will be served later cannot be cooked.Mu Yan wrinkled his little face, and stood still in a tangled state.\u201cJust say don\u2019t let that man come with you. It\u2019s inconvenient to do anything. Next time, just the two of us will be together and don\u2019t want him.\u201d No. 5 took the opportunity to say.\u201cI have found two new ingredients today, why don\u2019t we go back first, it will be much more convenient to go back to cook.\u201d Mu Yan thought for a long time, and finally came up with a good way, and the more he talked, the more he felt that this way was too much. All right.The reason why he stayed here for lunch was just to find more ingredients. Now that he has found two, it is not a small gain. Even if he doesn\u2019t look for it in the afternoon, he will save the rest for next time. Bar.Well, that\u2019s it, Mu Yan nodded secretly, and then said to Mu Chen who was processing the prey: \u201cAh Chen, there is no tool to boil water here, let\u2019s go back to eat at noon today.\u201dAlthough Mu Chen didn\u2019t know why Mu Yan changed his mind, he felt that any decision made by Mu Yan was good and he would accept it, so he nodded without hesitation, and cleaned up the rabbit and pheasant that had been bled. Ready to take it away later.\u201cNo. 5, you go back and put the kitchen utensils in the storage room first, so that we can get the kitchen utensils directly from the storage room when we go back later.\u201d In this way, Mu Chen will not feel strange, Mu Yan thinks that he can think So proud and proud of such a perfect practice.No. 5 is not willing to leave first, let alone let Yan Yan be with this man alone, but Mu Yan has obviously made up his mind, No. 5 has no choice but to leave first, and before leaving, he still gives Mu Chen a vicious eyes.Mu Chen suddenly raised his head and looked towards the place where No. 5 was, with a deep and sharp look in his eyes, as if he knew that No. 5 existed in that place.No. 5 was taken aback immediately, and the hair on his whole body stood on end. If it wasn\u2019t extremely sure that other than Mu Yan, the host, it would be impossible for anyone else to see it. It would really think that Mu Chen was looking at it. to its existence.In fact, even Mu Chen didn\u2019t know why, at that moment, he always felt that there was something in that place, but when he saw it, there was nothing.No. 5 didn\u2019t dare to stay here any longer, said a few words to Mu Yan in a hurry, and then flew away. It looked like there was something terrifying chasing after it, and the fog on Mu Yan\u2019s head was seen. water.No. 5 returns home first, while Mu Yan and Mu Chen walk slowly behind. During the period, if Mu Yan sees any familiar ingredients or something that looks familiar, he will stop and observe carefully, so the time to go home is not too long. It was extended a lot, until the sun was overhead, and the two of them arrived home.\u201cLet\u2019s put these ingredients here, I\u2019ll go to the storage room to get something.\u201d Mu Yan said to Mu Chen, and then walked towards the storage room.Mu Chen put away all the ingredients, followed into the storage room, and transferred all the things Mu Yan was holding to his hands.\u201cI can handle this little thing.\u201d Mu Yan said shyly, but he felt warm in his heart.In the past, when he was at home, he basically did all the work, and no one would help him. However, after he came to this world, he not only met Aunt Lin and Uncle Yang who were very nice people, but also met a friend who helped him everywhere. Ah Chen, that\u2019s great!\u201cYou have to cook later.\u201d It will be very tiring.Although Mu Chen didn\u2019t say the second half of the sentence, but Mu Yan understood it, and his heart immediately became warmer, with a hint of sweetness, and a sweet smile appeared on his face uncontrollably.\u201cWhat else do you want?\u201d Mu Chen asked proactively.\u201cNo need, these few are enough.\u201d Mu Yan said, \u201cJust put the things here.\u201dWhen the two came to the yard, they still used the simple hearth that Mu Yan had built before.Due to limited ability and strength, the wood-built stove is very irregular, and it is not easy to use, but it can only make do with it.Mu Chen put all the things away, and put the pot directly on the stove for Mu Yan. His eyes stayed on the stove for a while, and then he consciously went to wash the vegetables.Mu Yan filled the pot with water and put it on the stove to burn it, ready to use it to remove chicken feathers later.The rabbit was treated by Mu Chen before, and the rabbit skin was completely peeled off.In the process of boiling water, Mu Yan picked off the cabbage one by one for later use, without chopping them up, and then cut the white and fat radish into pieces, planning to use it for stewing or stir-frying later .In the end, Mu Yan washed the mushrooms and some shiitake mushrooms that he met on the way back, and weighed the corresponding sizes, intending to use them to stew chicken.God knows how excited Mu Yan was when he encountered mushrooms in the forest. You must know that although he has never eaten chicken stewed mushrooms, the aroma is still in his mind until now. He has long wanted to eat mushrooms. Have a taste.In the past, once when I was in town, I passed a restaurant, and there was a strong aroma inside, so seductive that he almost couldn\u2019t even walk. After listening to the discussion of the people around, he realized that it was the signature dish of that restaurant\u2014\u2014 Chicken stew with mushrooms.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although the pheasant is no longer a chicken, it is still a chicken.After the boiling water was ready, Mu Yan hurriedly wanted to remove the feathers of the pheasant. Of course, it was impossible for Mu Chen to let Mu Yan do it himself, so Mu Yan could only stand aside and watch eagerly.After the pheasant was plucked, Mi Chen chopped it into pieces under Mu Yan\u2019s guidance, put them all in a cooking pot, put some salt, and put all the diced mushrooms and shiitake mushrooms into the pot , cook with the chicken.Mu Yan has never cooked this dish, so he can only make it roughly according to the name. He also knows that other seasonings are definitely needed, but the conditions are limited, and he is already very satisfied if he can have mushrooms.The cooktop is uneven, and someone must be watching it all the time, otherwise the pot may tilt or slide down.And this task is handed over to Mu Yan, and Mi Chen has to deal with the rabbit.Originally, Mu Yan planned to cook cabbage stew, but seeing that there was already chicken stewed with mushrooms in this meal, he thought to put the cabbage stew in the next meal, otherwise he would not be able to finish it if he made too much.There is no way to have only vegetables without rice, so Mu Yan tried to make some pasta with nutritional powder.Last time he made gnocchi, this time he decided to make noodles, and it was baked, so that oil and pans were not needed, and it was also convenient.As soon as he said it, Mu Yan was kneading the noodles while staring at the pot of stewed chicken and mushrooms to prevent it from crooked. Of course, most of the time he asked No. 5 to help him watch, so that he could concentrate more As for making noodles, as long as it is related to food, No. 5 is extraordinarily serious and attentive.Mu Yan cracked two eggs into the bowl containing the nutrition powder, so that the noodles would be firmer and taste better.The egg-added dough is a bit yellowish, but it doesn\u2019t affect others. Mu Yan divides the dough into small doughs, then rolls them into palm-sized pancakes, and sticks the pancakes to the pot where the chicken stewed mushrooms On the four walls, while the pot is stewing, it can also bake the noodles through its own heat, killing two birds with one stone.Of course, this is entirely due to limited conditions, and Mu Yan can\u2019t think of other good ways.\u201cYanyan, what are these?\u201d No. 5 asked when he saw the round cakes sticking to the wall of the pot.\u201cThis is bread, you can eat it as a meal.\u201d Mu Yan said with a smile.After the stewed chicken and mushrooms were ready, Mu Yan fried another radish, and the meal was considered ready.Same as last time, Mu Yan took out a big bowl, filled a serving of stewed chicken with mushrooms and stir-fried radish, and took several noodle cakes, intending to send them to Yang Wenyao\u2019s family. With Mu Chen, of course these \u201cheavy\u201d things are still carried by Mu Chen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, a person who had been eating nutrition powder for decades suddenly ate something else, and it was still delicious. , definitely no less than the feeling of a homeless man who suddenly ate a full banquet, how could he not be surprised.When Mu Yan came here last time, Yang Wenyao happened to be out on business, so he didn\u2019t see him directly.But he also ate it, because Lin Jiayu left a portion for him. Although the noodles were already cold when eating, and the taste was not as good as when it was hot, for those who ate it for the first time, it was still delicious. Very delicious.And this time he happened to be at home, watching Mu Yan come over with the steaming chicken stewed mushrooms, the aroma was more fragrant than all the smells he had smelled, and it made people salivate.\u201cIt smells so good, Brother Yan, what did you bring this time? It tastes even more fragrant than last time, is it still the same delicious stuff as last time?\u201d Yang Yingying couldn\u2019t help asking, the child\u2019s self-control There are always no adults.\u201cThis time it\u2019s stewed chicken with mushrooms, stir-fried radishes, and noodle cakes. If Yingying still likes noodles, I\u2019ll make them for you next time.\u201d Mu Yan said while stroking Yang Yingying\u2019s hair with a smile.\u201cYanyan, you are too polite. I am really embarrassed to bring so many precious things every time I come here.\u201d Lin Jiayu said shyly, glanced quietly at the chicken stewed mushrooms, and secretly swallowed. Swallow.From the last time she knew how delicious the food made by Mu Yan is. Of course, the most precious thing is not here, but only Mu Yan can make these things. There is only one copy in the world. Can there be anything more precious than this? ?As long as Mu Yan thinks, he can rely on this to live a very good life, and they are just helping Mu Yan with a little effort, but Mu Yan takes it to heart, and every time there is something good, he will give them a share. How could she not like such a child who knows how to repay her kindness.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Faced with Lin Jiayu\u2019s thanks, Mu Yan was flattered and at a loss, waved his hands hastily, and said, \u201cThese things can be found in the forest, and Chen and I found them together. \u201c\u201cThank you too, Yan Yan, no one knew how to eat these plants before, but you found out, then these methods should belong to you, you don\u2019t need to tell anyone, but now you We are naturally grateful for sharing it with us, so you don\u2019t have to feel burdened.\u201d Yang Wenyao said with a gentle smile.But then, as if thinking of something, he frowned, his expression became serious, and he said something similar to what Lin Jiayu said last time, \u201cYanyan, these edible raw materials, you must not tell the third person , These are very precious in the federation, if you say it, it may bring you disaster.\u201dYang Wenyao thought more deeply and comprehensively than Lin Jiayu, and carefully told Mu Yan that his so-called third person pointed out people other than Mu Yan and Mu Chen. After all, Mu Chen lives with Mu Yan now, and Mu Yan has What, Mu Chen basically knows, and Mu Chen must also know about the ingredients that make these delicious food, so he can\u2019t hide it from him, but others must hide it.As for whether Mu Chen would speak out, Yang Wenyao had a hunch that Mu Chen would not do so.\u201cI know, eat it while it\u2019s hot, it won\u2019t taste good when it\u2019s cold, so Chen and I will go back first.\u201d Mu Yan said.\u201cBrother Yan, next time I\u2019ll go to your house to play with you.\u201d Yang Yingying said with a smile, waving her little hand.\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Yan also waved back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was what Mu Yan told No. 5 before they left, because they were worried that No. 5 would be found eating after they came back.Mu Chen stared thoughtfully at several plates containing vegetables, and No. 5 became nervous for no reason. It seemed that after being watched by Mu Chen\u2019s sharp gaze once in the forest, No. 5 would always have something to do when he saw Mu Chen. A feeling of trembling in my heart.\u201cYanyan, I\u2019m going back to my room first.\u201d After No. 5 finished speaking, he fled in despair.Mu Chen didn\u2019t say anything in the end, he pulled the stool away, let Mu Yan sit down first, and then sat down opposite him, imitating Mu Yan\u2019s movements, and picked up the two slender wooden sticks on the table.This is the first time he has seen this kind of slender wooden stick on the dining table. What is it used for?Mu Chen observed Mu Yan\u2019s movements calmly, and found that this small wooden stick was actually used to pick up vegetables, and it looked very flexible and convenient, so he also tried to use it to pick up chicken.\u201cPa-ta\u201d, a piece of chicken fell directly from the basin onto the table, and there was a crack on Mu Chen\u2019s expressionless face, and Mu Yan clearly saw that the other\u2019s face seemed to turn dark.Mu Yan couldn\u2019t hold back the cuteness of the contrast, and burst out laughing \u201cpuchi\u201d.\u201cThis is chopsticks, this is how they are used.\u201d Mu Yan sat over and taught Mu Chen the correct way to use chopsticks.Feeling that tender little hand holding his big hand, Mu Chen suddenly felt that the embarrassment just now seemed to be acceptable.If there are such benefits every time, then it is okay to come again several times.Of course Mu Yan didn\u2019t know Mu Chen\u2019s inner thoughts at the moment, otherwise that little thin face would turn red and steaming again.Seeing that Mu Chen was finally able to use chopsticks to pick up dishes by himself, Mu Yan\u2019s sense of accomplishment gradually increased, and he couldn\u2019t help but give Mu Chen a few dishes with chopsticks to reward him for his learning achievements.Mu Chen silently ate the food that Mu Yan brought over. He could guarantee that he would never have eaten the taste and taste that he had never experienced before, even if he had not lost his memory.\u201cIs it delicious?\u201d Mu Yan asked nervously.Mu Chen nodded, and the chopsticks never stopped hitting again and again. Although he didn\u2019t say a word, he responded directly with actions.Seeing this, Mu Yan showed a satisfied smile, and began to concentrate on eating.Both of them were very satisfied with this meal, and their stomachs were rounded, even Mu Chen, who has always had strong self-control, couldn\u2019t help eating too much.Mu Chen felt warm in his stomach now, as if there was a small stream of warm air flowing through his stomach and abdomen, and the place where it flowed was very comfortable, even the previously aching abdomen had slightly improved.But this kind of change is not big, so Mu Chen didn\u2019t take it to heart.This beautiful weather, suitable temperature, after drinking and eating, I feel a little drowsy. Mu Yan\u2019s eyelids have already started to fight up and down, and his small head is even bit by bit. Be careful to fall and hand it up.\u201cMu Mu, go to the room to rest if you are sleepy, I will clean up here.\u201d Mu Chen said to Mu Yan.\u201cHmm\u2026Okay.\u201d Mu Yan\u2019s voice was soft and waxy, with an unconscious nasal voice. It sounded so cute that one couldn\u2019t help but want to grab it and knead it.Of course Mu Chen would not do this, he tried his best to suppress the desire in his heart, in order not to frighten the child, and then coaxed the child into the room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Mu Yan felt very surprised, sat up immediately, and shouted: \u201cNo. 5, come and see Look, how did this task bar go so fast? Didn\u2019t we just find five kinds of food, why did it become eight kinds here?\u201dMu Yan clearly remembered that they found five kinds before.

So what are the remaining three?\u201cOh, the remaining three are the rabbits, pheasants and eggs we ate today.\u201d Number Five replied.\u201cAre rabbits and pheasants also counted? Then we also ate rabbits last time, why didn\u2019t they count?\u201d Mu Yan was very puzzled.

We didn\u2019t count it as finding it ourselves, but this time it was hunted by that man, so we counted it as finding it ourselves, and it counted as one of them.\u201d Although Number Five was reluctant, but I have to admit that the man is still useful.However, that\u2019s all there is to it, it\u2019s still not as powerful as his No. 5, he\u2019s still Yanyan\u2019s most powerful helper!\u201cSo that\u2019s the case.\u201d The question in Mu Yan\u2019s heart was answered, and he felt a lot more relaxed. Seeing that the task was about to be completed, he felt that he would have a good dream today.After sleeping for an hour, Mu Yan came out rubbing his eyes, and saw Mu Chen crouching in the yard, messing with something, and there seemed to be some changes in the yard, but he just woke up and was still a little dazed, and he didn\u2019t notice what it was. There has been a change.\u201cAchen, what are you up to?\u201d Mu Yan walked over and asked in a cute nasal voice.\u201cAre you awake? Go sit over there first, it\u2019s a bit messy here, wait for me to clean it up.\u201d Mu Chen took Mu Yan\u2019s little hand, brought him to sit on a recliner, and then went back to clean up the mess.After a while, Mu Yan regained consciousness a lot, and saw things around him more clearly, only then did he realize that the yard seemed to have changed a lot, especially the place where he built the stove before was completely empty.The cooktop is missing? Mu Yan was suddenly a little confused.Obviously he was still cooking there before going to sleep, why did he disappear completely after sleeping?\u201cMu Mu, come over and try this, is it useful?\u201d Mu Chen waved to Mu Yan.Mu Yan maintained a bewildered expression, walked towards Mu Chen, and then found that there was a stove in front of Mu Chen, and it was a very beautiful stove, which was better than the one he built by himself before. That is much prettier.What\u2019s going on here?\u201cI see that you are not comfortable cooking with that stove, so I built a new one for you. Can you try it and see if it works? If it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll change it for you.\u201d Mu Chen said with a smile, his tone quite serious. A sense of invitation.Mu Yan suddenly felt his heart swell, as if something was about to overflow.Hastily took out all his pots, and put them on the stove one by one to try, and found that this newly built stove was much easier to use than the one he had built casually before. , and Mu Chen also made two, so that when one cooks, the other can cook at the same time, which can save a lot of time.Mu Yan likes these two stoves very much, and he can\u2019t wait to cook on them now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When I do, I\u2019ll tell you about the raw materials needed for it.\u201d No. 5 said to Mu Yan.\u201cOh.\u201d Mu Yan didn\u2019t immediately ask No. 5 to tell him everything.At this moment, the cold mechanized voice of the system sounded again: \u201cRelease the first-level task, make a hundred scallion pancakes, you can upgrade to the second-level, and get a chance to draw a lottery.\u201dNumber Five: \u2026No. 5 never expected that the face slap came so fast and so loudly, and it just told the host that the scallion pancakes are not available for the time being, and the system ended up slapping the face \u256d\u2229\u256e(\ufe36\ufe3f\ufe36 )\u256d\u2229\u256eSystem, don\u2019t leave after school if you\u2019re capable, we\u2019ll be singled out!Mu Yan looked at No. 5 with a cute face, waiting for No. 5 to read him the recipe of scallion pancakes.\u201cThe main ingredients needed for scallion pancakes: flour, shallots, salt, oil, pepper\u2026\u201d No. 5 dutifully read out every word.\u201cThere is no flour, so we can use nutritional powder instead, but for the rest, we only have salt now, and we need to look for chives, oil, and pepper.\u201d Mu Yan carefully counted the ingredients he had and the ingredients he didn\u2019t have, And I plan to focus on finding these when I go to the forest next time, otherwise I won\u2019t be able to make scallion pancakes approved by the system without the materials, and then I won\u2019t be able to upgrade.\u201cYanyan, since we\u2019ve reached the first level, the identification technique should be activated. It will definitely be easier for us to use the identification technique to find ingredients.\u201d No. 5 said hastily.As if responding to No. 5\u2019s words, the cold voice of the system sounded again: \u201cAppraisal is activated, level is zero, identification ability: primary, I hope the host will continue to work hard and upgrade as soon as possible.\u201dNumber Five: \u2026You come out of the system, I promise not to kill you! Every time it picks it and it appears after finishing speaking, you said that you si did not si on purpose!Hmph, even if you say you didn\u2019t do it on purpose, I don\u2019t believe it! Number Five thought arrogantly in her heart.Hearing the identification technique, Mu Yan\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up, and his delicate little face looked even more radiant.\u201cNo. 5, let\u2019s go and appraise the corn.\u201d Mu Yan said excitedly. He had already decided that after the appraisal technique was activated, he would be the first one to appraise that strange corn.\u201cOkay.\u201d When No. 5 thought of the various methods of corn that Mu Yan had mentioned before, his saliva was about to flow down, and he naturally responded to Mu Yan\u2019s proposal very positively.When Mu Yan goes to the forest, of course he must take Mu Chen with him, or in other words, Mu Chen absolutely does not allow Mu Yan to go to the forest alone.Because of the identification technique, Mu Yan is in a very good mood. When he encounters a strange plant on the road but feels that it should be edible, Mu Yan can\u2019t help but identify it.The results of one, two, and three identifications are the same\u2026\u201cSorry, this object is beyond the identification range, and the identification technique cannot be recognized. Please upgrade first.\u201d The unique cold voice of the system sounded again, three times in a row.Muyan: \u2026Number Five: \u2026\u201cNo. 5, what should I do? Could it be that they can\u2019t be identified?\u201d Mu Yan felt a little uneasy, and couldn\u2019t identify it three times in a row. No matter whether the plant was big or small, the result was the same, which made Mu Yan\u2019s The good mood is also discounted.Seeing that Mu Yan was depressed on the 5th, he hated the identification technique even more, **** it, since he can\u2019t identify anything, he even turned on a woolen thread, so he doesn\u2019t have to play tricks like this.Its little host is so cute and cute, how could the identification technique have the heart to play with him? It\u2019s just too shameless and heartless to make trouble.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Mu Chen, who was walking next to Mu Yan, kept his attention on Mu Yan. Seeing that Mu Yan, who was in a good mood with a smile on his face, suddenly became depressed and worried. .\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Mu Yan tried his best to raise a smile, trying to reassure Mu Chen, but he didn\u2019t know that his appearance made Mu Chen even more worried.\u201cYanyan, maybe that corn can be identified. Since the identification technique is enabled, there must be something that it can identify. If we encounter plants that may be edible, we will identify them. Maybe we will find something.\u201d Number five hurriedly said comfortingly.Mu Yan also felt that he was too impatient. The system itself is a very magical existence. If there is no system, he might not be able to eat these things when he can eat them. As a result, he has obtained a lot now, but he still wants to get it greedily. More, such thinking is wrong.After Mu Yan figured it out, the gloom in his heart dissipated immediately, the smile returned to his face again, and he felt much more relaxed.Mu Chen looked at Mu Yan with deep eyes, and his emotions also became ups and downs with the ups and downs of his mood.Together, the two of them quickly came to the corn tree that I wrote down earlier. Looking at the corn that was full of trees, Mu Yan still thought it was amazing.\u201cDo you want to pick?\u201d Mu Chen asked when he saw Mu Yan\u2019s surprised look.During these days of getting along, he can be regarded as understanding that when the other party encounters something he is interested in, his eyes will light up, and then he can\u2019t help but step forward to be curious. If he can be sure, he can basically make a lot of things when he goes back. Delicious food, in this regard, Mu Chen will feel very amazing every time he eats it.He didn\u2019t know how the boy who looked so soft and cute could have so many ways to eat in his mind, and each of them was something he had never eaten before, and it was very delicious.\u201cWell, just pick one.\u201d Mu Yan nodded.The tree was too tall for him, he couldn\u2019t reach it, and there was No. 5 who could help him before, but Mu Chen was there, and No. 5 was inconvenient to help him, otherwise he thought it was a supernatural event.Mu Yan is sometimes a little cautious about hiding things about Mu Chen No. 5, but the existence of No. 5 is too unbelievable, just like he suddenly appeared in this new world out of thin air, even he knows that this is impossible. Things that are easily said, even if he will marry in the future, he may treat these as eternal secrets.Mu Chen didn\u2019t know that Mu Yan had already changed a lot of thoughts in his heart, so he quickly picked a corn for Mu Yan, and then handed it to him.Mu Yan took the corn and quietly tried it with the identification technique, but the voice that kept appearing \u201cSorry, this object is beyond the identification range, the identification technique cannot be recognized, please upgrade first\u201d turned into \u201cGolden grains, also known as corn , Poaceae Zea genus, edible.\u201dAlthough the system\u2019s voice is still cold and emotionless, Mu Yan and No. 5 feel that the voice is so beautiful and pleasant. After listening to it all the way, they can\u2019t identify it, but when they suddenly meet someone who can identify it, the feeling is definitely no less than winning a big prize. .\u201cAchen, this thing is edible, let\u2019s pick some more and I\u2019ll cook corn for you to eat.\u201d Mu Yan said with bright eyes, his excitement was beyond words.\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Chen is always indulgent towards Mu Yan, he will pick whatever the other party wants, as long as the other party is happy.Mu Chen and Mu Yan cooperated very tacitly, one picked it from the top, and the other picked it from the bottom. After a while, all the small baskets brought by Mu Yan were full.Looking at the basket full of corn, Mu Yan smiled so hard that his eyes couldn\u2019t see.This basket of corn was naturally carried by Mu Chen, and Mu Yan wanted to share some of it several times, but Mu Chen stopped him.\u201cI\u2019m physically strong, that\u2019s nothing.\u201d Mu Chen\u2019s words were not false at all, such a small amount of weight was almost like nothing to him.But on the other hand, Mu Yan, that thin body, that small body, might have crushed him directly on the back of the basket. How could he be willing to let Mu Mu eat more when he went back, so that he could become fat? it is good.The main purpose of their visit to the forest this time was to identify corn. Now that the task was completed, Mu Yan felt more relaxed. On the way back, Mu Yan kept using the identification technique, even though most of the sounds he got It\u2019s \u201cSorry, this object is beyond the identification range, and the identification technique cannot be recognized, please upgrade first\u201d, but occasionally the identification is successful.It\u2019s just that most of the plants that have been successfully identified are inedible, and Mu Yan is quite familiar with the results of the identification, that is, the plants that he had in his previous life.At this moment, Mu Yan didn\u2019t know that he was using the identification technique uninterruptedly, so that the proficiency in using the identification technique continued to increase, and there was only a short distance left to upgrade.\u201cScallions, Liliaceae allium plants, edible.\u201d The cold voice unique to the identification technique sounded again, making Mu Yan and No. 5, who were habitually planning to leave after the identification, stopped in unison.\u201cYanyan, did I hear the sound of a successful appraisal just now?\u201d Number Five asked blankly.\u201cI seem to have heard it too.\u201d Mu Yan also replied in a daze.If Mu Chen could see No. 5, he would find that No. 5 and Mu Yan had almost the same expression.No. 5 and Mu Yan acted in unison and immediately backed up, pulling around, and throwing the identification technique next to each other again.Because they identified too many things along the way, they basically heard the voice of \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d.Therefore, the one-person-one system hardly paused at all, and while walking, they were throwing the identification technique, which led to the fact that when they suddenly heard a plant that was successfully identified, both of their bodies were inertial and did not react and continued to move forward. When it came time to find the plant that was successfully identified, I had no impression of that plant at all, so I could only re-identify it in a small area.Mu Chen was already used to Mu Yan\u2019s behavior of stopping to look for something from time to time, so he just stood quietly and waited.\u201cAh Chen, come and see, I found a chive.\u201d Mu Chen grabbed a slender plant with white stems and green leaves, and waved it cheerfully at Mu Chen.\u201cMu Mu is awesome, I found another edible ingredient.\u201d Mu Chen praised without hesitation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He remembered that people in the village used to cut some pork belly during the Chinese New Year. The pork belly always has fat meat. This kind of meat can be fried in a pan to produce fat. It\u2019s delicious to cook.\u201cI don\u2019t know if there are any wild boars here. The fat fried from wild boars makes the most fragrant oil.\u201d Mu Yan said to himself, the voice was not loud, but Mu Chen\u2019s hearing was very developed, and he could hear clearly .Mu Chen didn\u2019t say anything at the time, but on the way back later, he talked a lot more, mostly discussing the ingredients he found with Mu Yan, and then pretending to ask wild boars unintentionally, such as what it looks like and how big it is , and then silently constructed a three-dimensional map in his mind according to Mu Yan\u2019s description, and kept all these in his heart.In the afternoon, Mu Chen went out on the pretext of having something to do, and Mu Yan suddenly felt a little uncomfortable.Ever since Mu Chen came to his senses and decided to stay here, he has been inseparable from Mu Yan. The farthest distance between them is only when one of them cooks in front of the stove at one end of the yard, and the other handles the prey at the other end of the yard. However, this was the first time he acted alone.But Mu Yan didn\u2019t get too entangled, after all, Mu Chen is also a human being, he has his own affairs and space, thinking this way, he continued to deal with the corn picked in the morning.\u201cYanyan, what are we going to eat later? Boiled corn? Grilled corn? Polenta?\u201d No. 5 saw Muyan keep handling the corn, and the golden corns made him salivate just by looking at them. endlessly.\u201cLet\u2019s eat boiled corn today, and save the rest for next time,\u201d Mu Yan said.Boiled corn is the easiest way to eat, but don\u2019t underestimate it because it is simple, the boiled corn is also very delicious.\u201cOkay.\u201d No. 5 bought it very much, no matter what Mu Yan did, it would be very supportive.Mu Yan peeled all the corn that needs to be boiled today, and did not peel off the coats of the other ones that are not needed for the time being, because the corn with the coats can keep fresh for a longer period of time.After handling the corn and putting the corn in the pot to cook, an hour and a half had passed, but Mu Chen hadn\u2019t come back yet, which made Mu Yan a little worried.\u201cNo. 5, what did you say Ah Chen went to, why hasn\u2019t he come back yet?\u201d Mu Yan asked worriedly, with worry on his small face.\u201cIt must have gone somewhere to play, I knew that such a person is the most unreliable, and I am the best, I will accompany you every day.\u201d Taking advantage of Mu Chen\u2019s absence, No. 5 quickly discredited the other party\u2019s image in Mu Yan\u2019s heart .Ever since Mu Chen gave No. 5 a glance from across the air last time, No. 5 always felt that he could see himself or be aware of his own existence, so every time Mu Chen was around, No. 5 didn\u2019t dare to be presumptuous.Now it\u2019s hard to catch the gap when Mu Chen is not around, so he has to try hard to smear the other party, so as to let out the suffocation that has been pent up in his chest for the past few days.However, just as No. 5 finished speaking, he felt a sharp gaze from behind, making his whole body, no, the whole system stiff, and the hairs on his body stood up, making his body stiff Can\u2019t move.\u201cMu Mu, I\u2019m back.\u201d Mu Chen\u2019s deep and magnetic voice came from behind, and Mu Yan looked over in surprise, not noticing the abnormal No. 5 at all.Number five: TAT Yanyan, why can you ignore me like this, I am the first to know you, and you didn\u2019t notice my stiff body, why can you leave me [Erkang hand]If Number Five\u2019s short hand can stick out of Mao Mao.\u201cHuh? What is this?\u201d Mu Yan noticed that Mu Chen was holding a beast that was bigger than others, with sharp mouth and fangs, and it looked a little scary.\u201cDidn\u2019t you want a wild boar? I went and hunted one for you, but I don\u2019t know if this is the kind you want.\u201d Mu Chen casually threw the beast to the ground, and the dull voice showed that the beast was The weight is not as light as Mu Chen can easily hold it.Mu Yan\u2019s eyes widened slightly, with a dazed expression on his face, and the stunned look made people want to step forward and squeeze him.Mu Chen thought so, so he did it.\u201cWhy are you stuck? If it\u2019s not the wild boar you want, I\u2019ll help you hunt another one tomorrow.\u201d Mu Chen said with a smile, the soft touch of his hands made him linger a little.Mu Yan came back to his senses and felt that the other party\u2019s hand was still on his face, and his fair little face suddenly showed a blush, which made the already alluring face even more alluring.\u201cNo, no need, this, this is fine.\u201d Mu Yan stammered nervously, wanting to take a step back to avoid the big hand that made his heart beat out of rhythm, but he was still yearning for the warmth.It was Mu Chen who put down his hand first, he always felt that his little face might burst red if he kept teasing like this.Mu Yan hurriedly forced himself to focus on the beast, and then he noticed that, if you look carefully, this beast is still very similar to the wild boar in his impression, except that the mouth and nose are sharper, and the teeth are sharper , a little bigger.Mu Yan threw an identification technique at the beast, and it was just a matter of convenience, but unexpectedly, it was actually identified.\u201cThe sharp-billed pig, belonging to the pig family, is edible.\u201dThe system\u2019s cold identification sound rang out, pulling Mu Yan\u2019s thoughts back. He didn\u2019t expect that the identification technique could even identify animals.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go and deal with it, what should I do with this?\u201d Mu Chen asked Mu Yan, holding one of the wild boar\u2019s front paws with one hand.\u201cUse hot water to scald the pig\u2019s hair off, then cut off the pig\u2019s head, and the pig\u2019s trotters\u2026\u201d Mu Yan said, while Mu Chen listened carefully, without the slightest bit of impatience.After Mu Yan identified that this was indeed a wild boar, he was a little excited. You must know that pigs are a good thing. You can eat almost all of them, and they are also very delicious. Especially with wild boars, the oil he needs is also It\u2019s settled, and it couldn\u2019t be better.Mu Chen was handling the wild boar over there, and Mu Yan was next to him, handing over a tool at any time, or helping to roll up his sleeves. The picture should be a little **** because of the wild boar, but it looks unusually harmonious and beautiful.No. 5 flew silently in mid-air, it always felt that its cute little host was about to be snatched away by the big bad wolf, and it might be the kind that would never return, the mood could not be changed My heart is blocked.In this regard, the moods of No. 5 and Yang Wenyao were miraculously synchronized.In order not to let himself be depressed, No. 5 decided to guard the corn, and it must have a good time when the corn boiled the first time.\u201cYanyan, is the corn ready?\u201d Number Five asked.Mu Yan walked up to the pot, opened the lid, poked it with chopsticks, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s almost ready after a quarter of an hour.\u201dHearing the news, No. 5 was immediately happy, and finally felt a little relieved.\u201cBrother Yan, we\u2019re here to play with you.\u201d A clear and crisp milk voice came from the door, and after a while, a cute little girl in a light green skirt walked away with another little boy in a royal blue dress. come over.\u201cYingying, Haohao.\u201d When Mu Yan saw the two children, his smile immediately widened.In their era, brothers as old as him were already married, and anyone who had children could be as old as Yingying Haohao.So every time Mu Yan sees Yang Yinghao and Yang Yingying, he always unconsciously wants to take care of them and pamper them. This is probably a kind of empathy effect.\u201cWow, brother Yan, what is this?\u201d Yang Yingying saw that Mu Chen was handling the wild boar, she walked over curiously, squatted down to look at it, her eyes were wide open, and her little hand even wanted to poke it eagerly.\u201cThis is a wild boar, the meat on it is delicious.\u201d Mu Yan replied with a smile.\u201cReally? Is it really delicious? Is it better than the chicken that brother Yan made before?\u201d Yang Yingying asked with bright eyes, and the corners of her mouth were shamefully shining.When Yang Yinghao saw his younger sister\u2019s hopeless appearance, he suddenly had the urge to cover his face. People who didn\u2019t know thought that their family abused his younger sister.However, Yang Yingying ate a lot of stewed chicken and mushrooms that Brother Yan gave them last time, and she didn\u2019t want to stop until she was full. Who would dare to marry her when she grows up?\u201cWell, it\u2019s better than chicken.\u201d Mu Yan said with a smile, thinking of the taste of pork that he ate once in a while, the taste was really memorable.Thinking about it now, even he couldn\u2019t help drooling.Seeing Mu Yan who was getting along very happily with the child, Mu Chen\u2019s eyes became softer, and the movements of his hands became faster, and the scene of Mu Yan playing and laughing with the child unconsciously appeared in his mind, and he just stood there. Guarding them by the side, the scene is extremely warm.\u201cYanyan, quarter of an hour is up, and the corn is ready to be cooked.\u201d No. 5 couldn\u2019t help but reminded seeing that they were having a good time there and no one was paying attention to the pot of corn.\u201cOkay, come here.\u201d Mu Yan responded to No. 5, then looked at Yingying and Haohao, and said, \u201cI cooked corn, which is also delicious.\u201dSure enough, as soon as she heard the food, Yang Yingying immediately followed behind Mu Yan, like a little tail. Although Yang Yinghao didn\u2019t show it, the eyes that frequently looked at the pot betrayed his heart.When the lid of the pot was not opened, the smell of corn was not too strong, but when the lid was lifted, the whole yard was filled with the fragrance of corn.This kind of aroma is different from the aroma of the dishes made before, with the unique taste of the food itself, thick but not greasy, light but not thin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It looks so beautiful. It looks delicious.\u201d Yang Yingying cheered very appreciatively, staring closely at the golden corns in the pot.Every corn kernel is crystal clear and beautiful, closely arranged, and constantly exudes an attractive fragrance.Mu Yan found a big pot, quickly put all the corn into the pot, and put it on the table in the yard.Yang Yingying always followed Mu Yan, dutifully being a little tail, wherever Mu Yan went, she would go there.Mu Yan found a few chopsticks, and poked the chopsticks hard through the tail of the corn, so that he could eat the corn with the chopsticks without worrying about being burned.Mu Yan handed the first corn to Yang Yingying, who had been waiting for a long time, and carefully told: \u201cIt\u2019s still very hot, eat it slowly.\u201dThen he gave the second one to Yang Yinghao, who was pretending to be an adult. Although he tried his best to imitate an adult, he was a three-year-old child after all, and he would show his childish side when he saw delicious food.Afterwards, Mu Yan made another skewer for Mu Chen, but Mu Chen had been dealing with wild boars and couldn\u2019t free up his hand to hold it, so Mu Yan had to help him hold it, and then handed the corn to the other\u2019s lips, saying: \u201d Would you like to try it?\u201dFollowing Mu Yan\u2019s strength, Mu Chen directly opened his mouth and took a bite on the corn, the corn kernels in his mouth, the fragrance exploded on the tip of his tongue, obviously it was only corn with a faint sweet taste, but Mu Chen insisted on eating the sweetness of sugar.\u201cIs it delicious?\u201d Mu Yan asked expectantly.\u201cWell, it\u2019s very sweet.\u201d Mu Chen replied, with deep emotion in his eyes.\u201cThen you should eat more, hunting is too hard.\u201d Under Mu Chen\u2019s gaze, Mu Yan\u2019s face was slightly flushed and hot, and he didn\u2019t dare to look at him, just kept holding the corn like this.Mu Chen didn\u2019t want Mu Yan to work too hard, and gnawed the corn down to the cobs in a few quick strokes.\u201cYou go and eat too, I\u2019ll make it soon.\u201d Mu Chen said to Mu Yan.\u201cwell.\u201dWhen Mu Yan returned to the table, he found that two children and a system were gnawing corn hard, their little cheeks bulging with the chewing movements, like two little squirrels eating, very cute.Mu Yan also picked up a piece of corn and gnawed it. The thick corn aroma was even more delicious and sweet than the corn they grew there. They all looked similar, but the taste was very different.\u201cYan Gege, this looks like a horse, please do it well.\u201d Yang Yingying asked vaguely while chewing hard.\u201cThis is corn. I\u2019ll send some to your parents later. It\u2019s better to eat it while it\u2019s hot.\u201d Mu Yan put down the corn in his hand, then took out another small pot, and picked up a few big and plump corn Put it in and pass it to the two kids.The child is three years old, he is considered a small adult, and can help the family with some things, and the distance between the two families is not far, so Mu Yan is relieved to let the two children send him off.\u201cGuaranteed to complete the task.\u201d Yang Yingying said playfully, then gnawed the corn in her hand, picked up the small pot, and walked towards the door with a swing.Seeing this, Yang Yinghao hurried to catch up, holding the other side with his hand, lest Yang Yingying accidentally fall to the ground with the basin.Mu Yan, who watched the two children leave, probably didn\u2019t expect that just because of this pot of corn, he would cause a small trouble.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As soon as Mu Yan went out, he saw Yang Yingying sitting on the ground crying, and Yang Yinghao arguing with another child angrily.\u201cDoes it hurt from the fall?\u201d Mu Yan hurried forward to hug Yang Yingying, coaxing her gently.\u201cBrother Yan, belch\u2026brother, corn, belch\u2026the corn has all fallen\u2026\u201d Yang Yingying hiccupped from crying, pointing to a few corns lying on the ground with her little finger, with her mouth flattened, feeling extremely wronged.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, brother has a lot at home, brother Huiyan will bring you some later.\u201d Mu Yan coaxed.\u201cQuickly apologize to Yingying.\u201d Yang Yinghao said angrily.\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t my fault in the first place.\u201d The little boy opposite Yang Yinghao also yelled back with his neck stuck.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Mu Chen stood there. His tall figure and cold expression instantly stunned the two children, but Yang Yinghao and Mu Chen were still familiar, so he immediately explained what happened just now. over again.It turned out that just a few minutes ago, after Yang Yingying and Yang Yinghao left Mu Yan\u2019s house carrying corn, they met a little bully in the village \u2013 Yang Quan.Although Yang Quan is not very old, he is used to being domineering in the village. Other children would like to take a detour when they see him.When he saw Yang Yingying holding a pot of fragrant corn in her hand, he knew it came from Mu Yan\u2019s house. Thinking about the recent rumors in the village, he felt a little ready to move.Yang Quan idly blocked the way of Yang Yingying and Yang Yinghao, kept looking into the basin, and asked casually, \u201cWhat is this?\u201dSeeing that it was Yang Quan, Yang Yingying was a little scared, and tightly held the hand holding the basin. Yang Yinghao took a step forward, blocking his sister behind, and said in a cold voice, \u201cGet out of the way, we are going home.\u201dYang Quan didn\u2019t get the answer, how could he get out of the way? Not only did he not get out of the way, but he wanted to reach out for the corn directly, which completely angered Yang Yinghao.Yang Yinghao gave all the pots to Yang Yingying, told her to go home first, and then blocked Yang Quan\u2019s way.Which of the children in the village would obediently hand in the \u201cprotection fee\u201d obediently when they saw him, but the brothers and sisters of the Yang family even dared to stop him. Now Yang Quan felt that his dignity had been damaged, and immediately stepped forward and shouted Yang Yinghao.After all, Yang Yinghao was only a three-year-old child with short hands and legs, and was pushed to the ground by Yang Quan in a few strokes, and Yang Quan immediately went to grab Yang Yingying\u2019s basin.\u201cBrother Yan gave this to us, you can\u2019t grab it.\u201d Yang Yingying dodged holding the basin, but the basin and the corn were not light, and it was hard to hold it, but this dodge made it even harder. With all the pushing and shoving, Yang Yingying fell to the ground together with the corn pot, and this is the current scene after that.Although Yang Quan is the overlord among the children, he is not very old after all. When he saw Mu Chen standing there like the King of Yama, he was frightened and cried immediately. The cry was louder than Yang Yingying\u2019s, and it was heartbreaking. Lung, as if he was the one being bullied.Yang Quan\u2019s cry immediately attracted many villagers, including Yang Quan\u2019s parents.As soon as Yang Quan\u2019s mother saw that her precious son was being bullied and cried, she stopped doing it immediately, rushed over angrily, protected her son behind her, pointed at Mu Chen and was about to scold, but seeing Mu Chen\u2019s expressionless face With an expression on his face, he was also trembling in his heart, and immediately shifted his target to Mu Yan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Is this how you repay us? How dare you bully a child in the village? You don\u2019t even look at how old you are, but you still bully a child. Yours Why is my heart so bad?\u201d Yang Quan\u2019s mother spoke sharply and blurted out long paragraphs like a machine gun.Mu Yan didn\u2019t realize what happened at all, and was scolded as a result, and immediately became more confused, and even forgot to refute.Mu Chen took a step forward and blocked Yang Quan\u2019s mother from looking at Mu Yan. His expression became colder and colder, and the surrounding temperature dropped several degrees. The surrounding villagers couldn\u2019t help shivering, let alone in the midst of a storm. Yang Quan\u2019s mother.But even so, Yang Quan\u2019s mother, who has always been aggressive, didn\u2019t think that a big man dared to do anything to her and a woman, and continued to scold: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Do you still want to beat someone? We kindly took you in, and you are not grateful to Dade.\u201d Forget it, but in the end you still want to beat us up, okay, you beat us hard, I think you can stay in Peach Blossom Village any longer.\u201dMu Yan hastily grabbed Mu Chen\u2019s sleeve, worried that he would hit the other party impulsively, and it would be fine for him to leave, but he was afraid that Aunt Lin and Uncle Yang would be hurt, after all, he was able to gain a foothold here because of them.But after pulling Mu Chen\u2019s sleeve, he felt sorry for Mu Chen. After all, he was scolded because of him, Ah Chen, but in the end he pulled Ah Chen, making him feel aggrieved and could only swallow it in his stomach. .At this moment, Lin Jiayu and Yang Wenyao who heard the movement also came out, and immediately saw Yang Quan\u2019s mother swearing non-stop, while Mu Yan and Mu Chen were both aggrieved and silent.Yang Yingying also saw her parents, and immediately felt confident. She hurried over and hugged her mother\u2019s thigh and cried, and told them what happened intermittently, not forgetting to tell Yang Quan.After Lin Jiayu listened to it, she immediately became angry when she saw Yang Quan\u2019s mother\u2019s accusation.\u201cObviously your son did something wrong. No one even touched your son. What are you yelling about? How do you usually educate your son? Are you teaching him to steal other people\u2019s things on the street?\u201d Lin Jiayu looked at When she touched a few corns lying on the ground, her heart ached, because she knew that everything made by Mu Yan was very delicious, but before she even tasted it, she was dropped by this little bastard. hateful!\u201cWhat did my son do wrong? Why didn\u2019t I see it? I saw him as an adult who dared to bully children. How can such a person stay in the village at ease? No, I have to ask him to give an explanation today. Otherwise, he must be driven out of the village.\u201d Yang Quan\u2019s mother persisted.The surrounding villagers pointed and pointed, and felt that what Yang Quan\u2019s mother said was too much.\u201cBullying people? What about your son bullying my son and daughter? Push my son, make my daughter cry, and dare to knock our things over to the ground. You can do such a thing at such a young age.\u201d , will you still have to grow up?\u201d Lin Jiayu sarcastically said with a sneer.When the surrounding villagers heard the words, they immediately pointed even more, and Yang Quan\u2019s mother\u2019s face turned pale with anger, and she said indiscriminately: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I see it, it was obviously your daughter who fell by herself. It\u2019s all my son\u2019s fault.\u201dLin Jiayu was immediately laughed out of anger, the degree of shamelessness of the other party completely refreshed her cognition.\u201cObviously he was the one who pushed me, and even dropped all my corn. Brother Yan gave it to my parents, but it all fell on the ground and I couldn\u2019t eat it.\u201d Yang Yingying said angrily, her eyes widened.

They are completely different from nutrition powder. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cIt should be true, right? I heard that he finished it and would give some to Yang Wenyao\u2019s family every time. Dahua has seen it several times.\u201d\u201cReally, are those really edible?\u201d\u201cI saw it once too. It smells really delicious. It smells much better than nutrition powder. It must be delicious.\u201d\u201cYang Wenyao\u2019s family is really lucky. They can eat such a unique food. I don\u2019t know how it tastes.\u201d\u201cThis thing called corn looks delicious. I really don\u2019t know where this guy got these things. I really want to try it.\u201d\u201cEven if this food is edible, don\u2019t think that everyone doesn\u2019t know. Every time he gets something delicious, he will send it to your home. He can stay in the village because of everyone\u2019s efforts. Since there are good things, everyone should come together. Sharing, but in the end he hid it all, he really raised a white-eyed wolf.\u201d Yang Quan\u2019s mother said immediately, deliberately bringing the topic to this.Of course, this was for Lin Jiayu and the others, as well as for the whole village, so don\u2019t think she didn\u2019t hear what those people were discussing just now.Sure enough, after Yang Quan\u2019s mother said these words, the expressions of the surrounding villagers changed slightly.Lin Jiayu was about to be driven mad by Yang Quan\u2019s mother\u2019s upside-down words, holding her breath in her chest, and her heart was terribly congested.She is a civilized person who has received higher education, and she is completely unable to yell like a shrew like Yang Quan\u2019s mother, but she can\u2019t be timid when facing the opponent, otherwise, wouldn\u2019t the opponent be more aggressive?\u201cMumu found and made these things by himself. Did you help him discover the corn, or helped him light the fire, or helped him go to a dangerous place to pick the corn?\u201d Mu Chen\u2019s voice was cool. asked, Yang Quan\u2019s mother was immediately speechless.\u201cSince you didn\u2019t do anything, why enjoy Mu Mu\u2019s labor.\u201d Mu Chen looked at Yang Quan\u2019s mother sharply, and Yang Quan\u2019s mother instinctively felt the danger, and her body couldn\u2019t help shivering.\u201cThen\u2026 Then the whole village agreed that he stayed in the village, otherwise how could he stay here?\u201d Yang Quan\u2019s mother tried her best to gain confidence, but found that she could no longer be like before.When Mu Chen heard this, a sarcasm curled up at the corner of his mouth, and he said, \u201cDo you think that the whole village will ask for credit like you, asking Mu Mu to bring out food? Or do you think that Mu Mu won\u2019t be able to go anywhere if he leaves here? gone?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, just relying on the skills of words, where will he live a bad life? He is here, and everyone may still have the opportunity to see his skills, but if he leaves here, you will have to live forever.

Ran away.Seeing that there was no excitement, the surrounding villagers all dispersed one after another for fear of offending Mu Yan and the terrifying Mu Chen. They also wanted to have a chance to eat the unique things made by Mu Yan. I don\u2019t know. Is it really better than nutrition powder?\u201cYanyan, I\u2019m sorry, I said those things without your consent.\u201d Lin Jiayu was also anxious at the time, and said along with Mu Chen\u2019s words, and only after she finished speaking did she realize that something was wrong in her words.Mu Yan shook his head and said: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I originally planned to open a food stall so that everyone can eat these things, but now it\u2019s just ahead of schedule.\u201dIn fact, this idea is not unique now. Mu Yan has thought about it before. The system of No. 5 is a food system, but the purpose is to promote food culture and let people in the entire interstellar experience the charm of food. These delicacies need to be promoted.Moreover, the system needs to make one hundred scallion pancakes to upgrade to the second level. If it is only eaten by the family, it will take a long, long time to make these one hundred sheets, but it will be different if it is sold at a small stall. Not only can it speed up the production The speed of the task, but also making money, won\u2019t it be better in one fell swoop?\u201cIs this really good?\u201d Lin Jiayu was a little worried, worried that Mu Yan\u2019s skills would be stolen by others.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, wouldn\u2019t it be great if everyone could taste the beauty of food?\u201d Mu Yan said with a smile.Lin Jiayu was infected by Mu Yan\u2019s smile, and suddenly felt that the boy was even more beautiful.\u201cThen if you need anything in the future, just tell Aunt Lin. Although Aunt Lin may not be able to help you with everything, she will definitely help you if you can.\u201d\u201cThen thank you Aunt Lin first.\u201d Mu Yan said goodbye to Lin Jiayu with a smile, and then went back to pick up some corn and sent it to Lin Jiayu\u2019s home.As for the ones that fell on the ground before, Mu Yan also picked them up, went back and washed them with water, and they can be used for cooking later, anyway, as long as the sand is washed away, they can still be eaten.After Yang Yingying\u2019s matter came to an end, Mu Yan continued what he hadn\u2019t done before. He picked a large piece of fat with thick fat from the wild boar, cut it into medium-sized pieces, and fried it in a frying pan. , Not long after, the fat on the fat meat was gradually fried out, golden and shiny, with an attractive taste.A large piece of fatty meat was fried in nearly half of the pot of lard until the fat came out of the fat, then Mu Yan drained the lard, put some salt in the remaining oil residue, and fried it again. It can be eaten as a snack, it is crunchy with a bite, not greasy, very delicious.Afterwards, Mu Yan mixed a small bowl of noodles and planned to try to make scallion pancakes. Although he didn\u2019t find pepper, there were enough ingredients, but the taste would be a little lacking.Put the reconciled noodles on the chopping board. This time, instead of dividing into individual doughs, roll the whole noodles together to form a large sheet of dough.Put a little oil on it, lift one end of the dough and fold it in half to the other end, let the oil spread evenly and put it back to the original place. Repeat the same steps several times until the oil can be evenly distributed on the entire dough.Then sprinkle some salt and chopped shallots, then carefully roll the dough from one side, roll it into a long oil roll, and cut off a piece at intervals with a knife.Pinch both ends of the cut noodles tightly to prevent the oil from leaking out, then flatten them with the palm of your hand from top to bottom, and then roll them into a thin layer with a rolling pin.Finally, brush a layer of lard on the pan, spread the prepared pancakes in the pan, and spread them on both sides for a few minutes, until the pancakes are cooked, browned and crispy, and the scallion pancakes are ready.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This should not be a complete scallion pancake, right?\u201cLet\u2019s see, maybe the system will approve it?\u201d No. 5 said with luck.Mu Yan had no choice but to open the system panel and look at the progress bar of the task. There was no change at all. He was not surprised at all. After all, the scallion pancake was a little different from the one in the recipe, but No. 5 felt a little disappointed.\u201cIt seems that you really have to follow the recipe exactly.\u201d Number five sighed, and it really wasn\u2019t okay to take chances.But thinking about No. 5, another question came to mind, and he said, \u201cYanyan, if you really want to follow the recipe completely, then the flour can\u2019t be replaced by nutritional powder, right?\u201dHearing this, Mu Yan was stunned for a moment, because he really hadn\u2019t thought about this question.\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I haven\u2019t found wheat yet.\u201d Mu Yan was a little worried. If the nutritional powder really can\u2019t replace flour, then you have to find wheat. If you don\u2019t find much wheat, you have to cultivate it yourself. Okay, then the time to complete the task will be infinitely extended.\u201cForget it, let\u2019s try it after we find the pepper, maybe, maybe it will succeed?\u201d No. 5 said not very confidently, the luck just now had been shattered, and he didn\u2019t dare to think about it anymore.\u201cCome here and taste the scallion pancakes first. It won\u2019t taste so good when it\u2019s cold.\u201d Mu Yan greeted No. 5 and said, for the future, just take your time. He doesn\u2019t force it now, anyway, there is still a lot of time to spend Let him find other ingredients, maybe he will find wheat tomorrow.Mu Yan is still very optimistic and full of hope for the future life.Number five is also a big-hearted master. One second he was still worried, but the next second he only had scallion pancakes in his eyes. Sorry for the others.\u201cMany times, Yanyan, the scallion pancakes are even more delicious than the previous scones.\u201d No. 5 couldn\u2019t help but praise while stuffing the scallion pancakes into his little mouth.Although Mu Yan didn\u2019t see its tiny hands that couldn\u2019t reach out, it was always a joyful thing to be recognized and praised for the things he made.\u201cAh Chen, try my new scallion pancakes.\u201d Mu Yan carried a small plate of sliced scallion pancakes, and rushed to Mu Chen\u2019s side, looking at Mu Chen with a begging expression.Mu Chen picked up a piece, took a bite, the scallion pancake was fried in the pan, the skin was thin and crispy, one bite, it was full of fragrance, both the fragrance of oil and the fragrance of shallots, very suitable for eating It is delicious for those who are used to it, let alone for those who have never eaten it.\u201cAh Chen, how\u2019s it going?\u201d Seeing that Mu Chen was just savoring carefully and didn\u2019t speak, Mu Yan couldn\u2019t help asking again.Although he got a delicious compliment from No. 5, but for some reason, he also wanted to get Ah Chen\u2019s approval.Mu Yan looked at him expectantly, making Mu Chen\u2019s hard heart soft. He caressed the soft hair with his big hand, with a gentle and doting smile on his mouth, and said in a deep and magnetic voice, \u201cIt\u2019s very tasty.\u201dHaving received the praise he wanted, Mu Yan was obviously very happy, and continued to ask: \u201cThen, what do you think of using scallion pancakes as the first takeaway food at the stall?\u201d\u201cScallion pancakes are easy to make, delicious in taste, and convenient to sell, yes.\u201d Mu Chen simply gave his reasons and a supportive answer.When Mu Yan was doing it before, he saw that although the fat was squeezed from animal fat, animals were not difficult for him to hunt, so the amount of fat was not a problem.What\u2019s more, he didn\u2019t want Mumu to open a big stall and make so many scallion pancakes, because that would be tiring, and he couldn\u2019t bear it.If Mumu wants to make money, then this task should be undertaken by him, not Mumu.He could see that Mumu liked to cook these foods, and the reason why he agreed to open a small stall was just to hope that Mumu would be happy.\u201cThat\u2019s really great. When we find the pepper, we can officially open the stall.\u201d Mu Yan was very happy, and couldn\u2019t help but hug Mu Chen\u2019s arm in circles, and Mu Chen let him hold him indulgently until He turned himself dizzy, and hugged the dizzy Muyan funny, with a helpless and doting smile.\u201cSo happy?\u201d Mu Chen\u2019s mood was unknowingly influenced by Mu Yan, and he became better.Although he doesn\u2019t remember what kind of person he was before he lost his memory, he always said that \u201cthe country is easy to change and the nature is hard to change\u201d. In fact, he doesn\u2019t like to talk and have too many expressions. I believe he was like this before, but now But there was an exception.Whenever he faces Mumu, or is with Mumu, the corners of his lips will rise unconsciously, and the expression on his face will also increase. If he is seen by someone he knew before, he might be very surprised. , so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m lucky to land on this planet where no one knows me.However, he can be sure that falling here and meeting Mumu is definitely the luckiest thing for him, not one of them.\u201cYeah, so more people will be able to eat scallion pancakes in the future.\u201d The task assigned by the system can also take the first step, Mu Yan quietly added in his heart.\u201cI like everyone to eat these? Are you afraid that they won\u2019t come to buy yours after they learn it?\u201d Mu Chen said jokingly. Of course, these things are not impossible.No matter what it is, the more popular it is, the more people will be jealous, and the more people will try to imitate it, which is unavoidable, not to mention that these things cannot be patented on this backward planet.However, Mu Yan didn\u2019t take it seriously, and was even very happy, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, if everyone can learn it, then more people will be able to taste the delicacy of food and appreciate the value of food.\u201dLooking at Mu Yan with a bright smile, Mu Chen\u2019s heart was touched again, it was crispy and itchy, and he really wanted to step forward and take a bite.When he just woke up, Mu Yan was still a sallow, emaciated, malnourished boy. He was obviously sixteen years old, but he looked like a ten-year-old at most.After these days of conditioning, the other party\u2019s dark yellow face has gradually become fairer, and the thin cheeks have also become a little fleshy, which makes people want to pinch.His appearance has also become more delicate, coupled with that bright smile that always hangs on his face, it makes him brighten up, and he will attract people\u2019s attention unconsciously.As usual, Mu Yan gave half of the food to Lin Jiayu and the others, but this time, Lin Jiayu was still worried about the rumors from the villagers.\u201cYanyan, you don\u2019t have to pay any attention to those outsiders. Those people just don\u2019t want to be jealous. Don\u2019t pay attention to them. You have worked so hard to find these things and do them well. We just provided you with a few Don\u2019t always worry about the one-day accommodation, isn\u2019t this treating us as outsiders?\u201d Lin Jiayu said earnestly, \u201cI know you are a good boy, and you always want us for everything, but don\u2019t you want to be a child? Is it a stall, we will go to your stall to buy it in the future, and you don\u2019t have to bother and give it to us all the time.\u201dIn this case, those villagers would have no reason to criticize Yanyan, and they would always accept a boy\u2019s kindness, which made them feel very sorry.Mu Yan was a little anxious when he heard the words, and wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Mu Chen.\u201cWe know.\u201d Mu Chen responded with Mu Yan, and then left with Mu Yan.\u201cWhy not? Is it because they don\u2019t like me?\u201d Mu Yan was very puzzled, and there was an injury on his expression that he didn\u2019t know.Mu Chen turned his head, faced Mu Yan face to face, looked into his eyes seriously, and said: \u201cIt\u2019s not because you are bad, they still like you very much, it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to bring you trouble, that\u2019s why they are like this, do not take it personally.\u201dMu Chen is not very good at comforting others, but he still uses his clumsy way to comfort Mu Yan.Mu Yan himself is quite optimistic, since Mu Chen said that Aunt Lin is doing it for his own good, not because he doesn\u2019t like him, then Mu Yan let go of this matter, and only thinks about giving more to Aunt Lin when she gets out of business in the future. Just a few of them.Next, Mu Yan wholeheartedly went to the forest to look for pepper. Since it is given in the recipe, it means that pepper exists in this world. As long as pepper is found, the scallion pancake is basically complete.After having a goal, Mu Yan will focus on plants that look similar to pepper when he goes to the forest, but after a few days passed, he found a few other ingredients, but the pepper was nowhere to be found.\u201cWhere is the pepper?\u201d Mu Yan was a little melancholy.You can\u2019t make scallion pancakes without pepper, so you can\u2019t upgrade, and if you can\u2019t upgrade, you can\u2019t get the next recipe, so sad.However, the past few days are not completely fruitless, because the identification technique has been used extensively, the proficiency progress bar is already full, and the identification technique has also been upgraded to a level, and there are more things that can be identified.Mu Yan is not able to go to the forest to find ingredients every day. After all, as a brother, his physical strength is limited. Basically, every time he goes to the forest, he has to rest at home for a day, and he will not go again until he regains his strength.But Mu Chen is different, he is strong and strong, even if he walks in the forest for three days and three nights, he will not feel too tired, so when Mu Yan is resting at home, he will go to the forest alone and come back From time to time, I can often bring back a lot of strange plants for Mu Yan to identify, to see if there is anything edible in them.In the past few days, Mu Chen often brings back some plants with small particles, which look like pepper. After all, the most talked about by Mu Chen these days is pepper.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Black and yellow are considered normal, while those blue, purple, and even red are very weird. Yes, sometimes Mu Yan feels a little scared when he sees it.But when thinking of the corn growing on the tree, Mu Yan felt that maybe the place where the pepper grows or the color will become very strange, which is not impossible in this world, so every time he will bring all the plants brought by Mu Chen. I identified it again, but unfortunately I still couldn\u2019t find the pepper.Mu Chen didn\u2019t feel depressed. Every time he came back, he would still bring back a lot of various small particles, even those that were not in a bunch. posture.But don\u2019t say, this kind of blanket search is actually effective.\u201cRed pepper belongs to the order of Pepper, the family of Pepper, and the genus of Pepper. It is edible.\u201d When he heard the voice he dreamed of, Mu Yan couldn\u2019t react for a while.Mu Yan stared blankly at the pod-like plant in his hand. This thing had nothing in common with the pepper in his previous life. There were pods on the outside and red granules inside. In front of him, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know him at all.So, this turned out to be the pepper he had been looking for all along?Sure enough, in this world, there is no weirdest, only weirder ones.However, although this pepper looks completely different from the previous life, it tastes the same.Mu Yan felt very excited, because this way he could make a complete scallion pancake, and he could also try whether the nutrition powder could replace flour and be recognized by the system?\u201cAh Chen, I found the pepper.\u201d Mu Yan handed his hand in front of Mu Chen, and there was a small slit pod on the open palm, revealing red peppercorns inside.\u201cThat\u2019s really great, congratulations.\u201d Mu Chen smiled and rubbed Mu Yan\u2019s little head, seeing the smile on his face again, he suddenly felt that no matter how hard he worked, it was worth it.In order to look for Pepper these days, Mu Mu basically wrinkled his face, which made him feel a little glaring, but a smile is the most suitable for Mu Mu.As long as he can maintain such a smile, he is willing to do anything!After sharing his joy with Mu Chen, Mu Yan began to experiment with scallion pancakes made of nutrition powder.Freshly picked peppers cannot be used directly, and must be fried and then ground into powder.The two men peeled off all the peppers they had collected, and then Mu Yan used a frying pan to dry-fry the peppers until the peppers were crispy, and then pressed the peppercorns into pepper powder with a rolling pin, and collected them in a small bottle for later use.The method of scallion pancakes is still the same as before, except that pepper is added to the step of sprinkling salt. When the scallion pancakes are out of the pan, there is a hint of spicy pepper in the burnt flavor, which is very delicious. attractive.Mu Yan handed the first piece of scallion pancake just out of the pan to Mu Chen, the biggest hero, and rewarded him for finding the most critical pepper, making No. 5 jealous.Forget it, for the sake of him finding the pepper, the generous No. 5 will let him eat the first one for now. While secretly swallowing, No. 5 thought silently in his heart.\u201cIs it delicious? How does it compare to the previous taste?\u201d Mu Yan looked at Mu Chen expectantly, waiting for his evaluation.Mu Chen chewed carefully, nodded, and praised without hesitation: \u201cIt\u2019s delicious, the taste is stronger and more fragrant than before.\u201dThe scallion pancake with pepper noodles has a slightly more spicy taste than the previous one, but this kind of spiciness is not heavy, which only makes the taste better.Being affirmed, Mu Yan felt happier in his heart than he had eaten it.\u201cYanyan, let\u2019s see if the task progress bar has changed?\u201d No. 5 didn\u2019t want Muyan to give too much thought to that hateful man, so he hurriedly inserted between them and said.Mu Yan handed the remaining scallion pancakes to Mu Chen, then turned back to the side of the pot, and then opened the system panel, but the task bar on it was still motionless, and the excitement just now was also slightly discounted.\u201cIt\u2019s still the same. It seems that nutrition powder can\u2019t replace flour.\u201d No. 5 said with a sigh.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, we have found the pepper, and we can definitely find the wheat.\u201d Mu Yan said, speaking for No. 5 and himself at the same time.He rolled out a total of five scallion pancakes, and only now baked one, so he continued to bake the other four. Although the task progress bar remained unchanged, the scallion pancakes made from the nutritional powder were still delicious.This time, only Mu Yan, Mu Chen and a system are eating. Mu Yan can eat at most one scallion pancake in one meal. Although number five likes to eat, he eats less, and the rest are all Mu Chen\u2019s.As a man, and a man with strong physical strength, Mu Chen has always had a lot of appetite.But this is normal for Mu Yan, after all, the appetites of their men have always been much bigger than their brothers.Men are the main labor force for work, so they should eat more.After eating and drinking, it is rare for the two of them to sit leisurely in the yard and bask in the sun. The warm sun shines on their bodies, making them feel warm and very comfortable. That said, it\u2019s all very rare and comfortable.Mu Chen felt that the warm breath in the abdomen was gathering more and more, and it kept surging along the meridians throughout the body. Every time it surged, the body would become unusually light and comfortable, and even the pain would often be faint. The place also seems to be smoothed out.He always felt that there should be something in his abdomen, which may have disappeared because of the heavy injury this time.As for what it was, he couldn\u2019t remember, but he was not in a hurry. This inexplicable air flow healed all his pains, and it also kept warming his meridians, making his body become more and more powerful. it is good.Before going to bed at night, Mu Yan habitually opened the system panel. Before he looked carefully, he heard No. 5\u2019s surprised cry: \u201cYanyan, the task progress bar has changed.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Mu Yan made a suspicious voice.\u201cYanyan, look at the task progress bar on the panel, it has increased.\u201d No. 5 said in surprise.Although there is only a little bit added on it, you can hardly notice it if you don\u2019t look carefully, but who is it, it is the great No. 5, which naturally cannot escape its sharp eyes.Mu Yan looked at the task progress bar on the panel according to his words, and it really increased a little bit. He reached out and clicked on it. The number of tasks changed from 0/100 to 1/100, which meant that a scallion pancake had been completed.But today he obviously used scallion pancakes made of nutritional powder, and when he finished making one, he looked at the system panel specifically, and there was no change at all. So what is the situation now?No. 5 obviously thought of the same question, but the one-person-one-system failed to find the answer.\u201cYanyan, if you are making more scallion pancakes tomorrow, just follow today\u2019s steps, and then we will see if there are any changes to this task.\u201d No. 5 suggested.\u201cYeah.\u201d Mu Yan nodded, planning to make scallion pancakes for breakfast tomorrow morning, well, let\u2019s make some mushroom soup to drink, scallion pancakes with mushroom soup should be pretty good too.Just like that, thinking about tomorrow\u2019s breakfast, Mu Yan gradually fell into a sweet dreamland.In his dream, he found rice, wheat, and many other crops, and he could cook a lot of delicious food every day, making buns and porridge for breakfast, eating a variety of rich dishes at noon, and having supper at night. Everyone was very satisfied, and then everyone ate and became fatter and fatter, and finally they all became fat balls, and they couldn\u2019t even walk.In the end, Mu Yan was woken up by the ball-like self in the dream. After waking up, he looked at his thin arms and legs, and he was relieved.Great, fortunately it was a dream, he still prefers his current body to his ball-like body, although he is a little thin, but at least he can move flexibly.\u201cYanyan, are we going to make scallion pancakes?\u201d No. 5 was still thinking about the task bar.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll go right away.\u201d Mu Yan threw the ball out of his mind, then got up, washed up, and started making scallion pancakes.From the beginning of dough making, I have been paying close attention to the changes in the task bar. It was not until the first cake was cooked and out of the pan that the task bar changed a little bit, and the value became 2/100.\u201cNo, we did the same thing yesterday, so why hasn\u2019t it changed?\u201d No. 5 and Mu Yan were even more confused now.\u201cYanyan, you are making a test card.\u201d Number Five continued.Mu Yan made another one according to his words, but at this time the task bar remained unchanged as if it was dead.\u201cWhat the **** is going on? There is no hint for this **** mission.\u201d No. 5 cursed angrily, but she never thought that this mission is also a part of itself. Didn\u2019t the curse even include herself? up.\u201cNo. 5, don\u2019t be angry. Although I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, at least using nutrition powder to make scallion pancakes can complete the task.\u201d Mu Yan comforted No. 5.Compared to No. 5\u2019s irascibility, Mu Yan is much more optimistic. Before, he thought that the scallion pancakes made of nutrition powder were not recognized by the system, and the wheat that could be made into flour was nowhere to be seen. It is not sure when this task will start.But now, although the task bar is increasing slowly, at least there is hope, right? At most, make more scallion pancakes, and sooner or later the task will be completed.Moreover, since the scallion pancakes made of nutrition powder can be used for tasks, the stall business can also be put on the agenda.Mu Yan, who was in a happy mood, quickly finished all the remaining scallion pancakes, and the task bar was added again, which further confirmed his thoughts.\u201cAh Chen, it\u2019s time to eat.\u201d After Mu Yan made the scallion pancake, he walked to Mu Chen\u2019s room and shouted into it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He could only circulate these qi over and over again, letting them flow from the dantian into the meridians, and then from the meridians. Flowing back to the dantian, it went round and round, and he could even \u201csee\u201d the trajectory and appearance of these gases moving in his body.Only at this time did Mu Chen discover that these mild gas riots were caused by the fact that their number was increasing, all of them were accumulated in the abdomen, and eventually they couldn\u2019t hold them anymore. , now consciously guiding them, the gas gradually calmed down, following the guidance and obediently flowing into the dantian.Mu Chen didn\u2019t know what the situation was, and he didn\u2019t understand that the mysterious and mysterious state he entered was called samadhi, and then he heard Mu Yan\u2019s call, and then \u201cwoke up\u201d from the samadhi.Although he didn\u2019t sleep all night, Mu Chen felt that his spirit was very good, even better than sleeping all night.\u201cAh Chen, I made scallion pancakes and mushroom soup for breakfast.\u201d Seeing Mu Chen coming out, Mu Yan hurriedly put his breakfast on the table for him.\u201cAchen, what do you think of my scallion pancakes? Can it reach the level of a stall? Do you think anyone will come to buy it then?\u201d Mu Yan asked cautiously, not very confident.After all, there is no such food in this world. It is not easy for everyone to make money. I don\u2019t know if they will be willing to ask them to spend part of the money to buy these foods. After all, nutrition powder can keep them from starving, and it is also Cheap.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious, and people will patronize it.\u201d Mu Chen smiled and comforted Mu Yan. Anyone who has eaten these things may find it difficult to eat nutrition powder.\u201cEn.\u201d Mu Yan replied shyly, and then put the stall on the agenda.The reason why Mu Yan set up food stalls is to complete the system task upgrade, and to spread the food culture, let more people know about food and realize the importance of food.However, there are not many tasks given by the system at present, so Mu Yan does not need to go to the stall every day. He only needs to go to the stall when the village opens a market. The rest of the time, he will still go to the forest to find New ingredients and find some seeds so that they can be planted after they have tools to plow the land.Mu Yan had no experience in setting up a stall, let alone Mu Chen, so the two had no choice but to ask Yang Wenyao and Lin Jiayu for guidance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It will be our village\u2019s turn two days later. We don\u2019t need many things. All we need is a table that can hold your items. But what you make is snacks. It\u2019s best to make it at home, and then sell it directly, don\u2019t do it in front of everyone, you can also set up a stall in front of your own house.\u201d Yang Wenyao told Mu Yan seriously, he knew that this small stall would be Mu Yan\u2019s main income source, if you do it on the spot and let others learn it, then you will suffer a great loss to Mu Yan.\u201cI see, thank you Uncle Yang.\u201d Mu Yan thanked obediently.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Uncle Yang will definitely bring Yingying and Haohao to join us.\u201d Yang Wenyao said with a smile, he was very pleased that Mu Yan was able to become financially independent.The time for the market was coming soon. According to Yang Wenyao\u2019s instructions, Mu Yan reconciled all the noodles one night in advance, and prepared all other materials. The next day, he got up before dawn to make pancakes.Because he didn\u2019t know how the sales would be, Mu Yan didn\u2019t dare to prepare too much, and made up to twenty cakes, so that even if they couldn\u2019t be sold, his family would be able to eat them all, and there would be no waste.Mu Chen followed Mu Yan to help him, seeing Mu Yan busy coming and going, felt very distressed, so he wanted to take over and help him do these things.In the past few days, Mu Chen has seen that Mu Yan has made a lot of scallion pancakes, even if he hasn\u2019t made them himself, he can take a look at them, not to mention that the steps of scallion pancakes are not difficult.\u201cNo. 5, can the scallion pancakes that Chen helped me count as part of the mission?\u201d Mu Yan asked No. 5 quietly in his heart.\u201cIt must be made by the host himself to be counted in the task, but\u2026\u201d No. 5 said, but he seemed to think of something, hesitated to speak, and finally made up his mind to say it: \u201cBut if the host\u2019s binding partner If it is made, it can also be counted on the host.\u201d\u201cBinding partner?\u201d Mu Yan was very interested in the new term.\u201cEach host will have a quota of binding partners. Once the binding cannot be changed or canceled, the binding partner will have a certain authority to control the system. Of course, this authority is given by the host.\u201d No. 5 explained to Mu Yan in detail listen.In fact, to put it bluntly, the binding partner is also the lifelong partner of the host. The system allows the host to share with his lifelong partner, but none of his previous hosts did this.After all, even a lifelong partner cannot guarantee that the other party will be loyal to him for the rest of his life. Once there is a betrayal, the secrets of the host\u2019s possession of the system will be in danger of being exposed, and the host may also be murdered to seize the treasure. This kind of thing has never happened before. Not that it never happened.The system produced in the same batch as it had several hosts who had bound their partners, but in the end they were betrayed by their partners and ended up dead. Therefore, it generally does not recommend that hosts bind this lifelong partner.Especially Mu Yan, No. 5 doesn\u2019t want him to be bound as a lifelong partner, after all, Mu Yan is soft and cute, and has a soft temper, so he is more likely to be hurt.\u201cYanyan, we are not in a hurry to upgrade, we still have a lot of time, let\u2019s just take it slowly, don\u2019t even think about binding your partner, we don\u2019t need it either.\u201d Number Five persuaded.Can the one who binds the partner Shenma compare to it, it is Yanyan\u2019s best partner!Mu Yan really didn\u2019t think about binding a partner at the moment, after all, he doesn\u2019t even have a partner now, so why talk about binding.However, when No. 5 explained it to him, an incomparably handsome face appeared in his mind, which belonged to Ah Chen. Maybe he subconsciously wanted to bind Ah Chen as a partner. .But Ah Chen lost his memory. He stayed here only because he couldn\u2019t remember his past. If he regained his memory, he might leave.Thinking of Mu Chen leaving, Mu Yan felt a twinge of pain in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Mu Yan asked confusedly when he heard Mu Chen\u2019s voice.Mu Chen didn\u2019t speak, and pointed to the smoking pot, the oil in the pot was going to turn black, Mu Yan screamed when he saw this, and hurriedly wanted to pick up the pot, but was preempted by his long and slender hands up.\u201cAren\u2019t you tired these days? Let me bake pancakes for you.\u201d Mu Chen poured out the oil in the pan, then added some more oil skillfully, and a thin layer lay on the bottom of the pan. Just enough to cook evenly.\u201cNo, no need, I can do it, I\u2019m not tired.\u201d Mu Yan said hurriedly, these are the amount of tasks he has to do, and he has to do it himself. It would be great if Ah Chen could stay here forever. If Chen is bound as a partner, it might be easier to upgrade.When Mu Chen heard Mu Yan\u2019s refusal, his originally dark eyes became even deeper, and something seemed to be brewing in the depths, making people afraid to look at each other, but the next second he heard Mu Yan\u2019s murmur in a low voice. :\u201cAchen, if you remember the past, will you leave here?\u201dMu Yan didn\u2019t dare to look at Mu Chen\u2019s expression, he just lowered his head and turned over the scallion pancakes in the pot.\u201cDo you want me to leave?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d Mu Yan replied almost without thinking.Mu Chen, who was originally brewing a storm, instantly became spring-like in his eyes, and the corners of his lips also rose.\u201cThen I won\u2019t leave.\u201d As long as you are willing to take me in, I will always be here, Mu Chen added silently in his heart.\u201cReally?\u201d Mu Yan was pleasantly surprised when he heard the words, \u201cThen what about your family?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already an adult, I can make decisions for myself.\u201d Mu Chen said lightly, he has the right to arrange the life he wants.Mu Yan immediately forgot the inexplicable sadness in his heart, and continued to make scallion pancakes in a happy mood, occasionally humming a few ditties.Twenty sheets of cakes were all ready soon, Mu Chen covered the cakes with a white cloth, and then brought them to the table supported by the door, and some villagers had already gathered outside the door, and immediately craned their necks curiously to see the situation. come over.After the news that Mu Yan was going to open a stall to sell some edible things got out, everyone was very curious.In the past, Mu Yan always brought some food to Lin Jiayu\u2019s family, and the smell of the food spread to the neighbors through the fence, which made those neighbors greedy for a long time.And those words in the village were first spread from these people. After all, everyone is from the same village, and everyone will know about any novel things soon.But in the beginning, what the neighbors spread was only how delicious the food was and how curious they were about the food. It wasn\u2019t a bad word. As for the rumors that followed, they were all intentionally distorted and spread by some careful people.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Unfortunately, the door was closed. Even if they were curious, they couldn\u2019t break in. They could only stay at the door from time to time. Take a couple of deep breaths to ease your anxiety.However, just like this, it made them scratch their heads even more, wanting to see what was going on inside.Now that the twenty pieces of cakes were brought out, they were still warm, and the scent was coming out from under the white cloth. The people present could smell it more clearly, and couldn\u2019t help sniffing their noses hard, wanting to smell more.\u201cIt smells so good, it\u2019s a fragrance I\u2019ve never smelled before.\u201d\u201cThis is emitted from under the white cloth. Is there something edible under the white cloth?\u201dMany villagers began to whisper, and all their eyes were focused on the white cloth, discussing eagerly.\u201cMu Yan, what\u2019s in it, why is it so fragrant?\u201d Finally someone couldn\u2019t help it and asked Mu Yan.Mu Yan uncovered the white cloth, revealing the neatly stacked scallion pancakes, and said with a smile, \u201cThis is scallion pancake, it tastes very crispy.\u201dAs soon as the white cloth was uncovered, the fragrance instantly became more intense. Many children watching couldn\u2019t help drooling, and even adults with strong self-control were secretly swallowing their saliva.\u201cWhat\u2019s that scallion pancake? Can this really be eaten?\u201d A young man asked, staring straight at the scallion pancake on the table.Although everyone is very interested in scallion pancakes, no one has come forward to buy them. Everyone is waiting for the first person to eat crabs. After all, when new things appear, everyone will always hold them unconsciously. Look at it with a vigilant mind.At this moment, a childish voice came from behind the crowd, and the voice was heard first: \u201cBrother Yan, we are coming.\u201dRelying on his small size, Yang Yinghao and Yang Yingying got out of the crowd, and stood beside Mu Yan.Mu Yan picked up a scallion pancake, skillfully cut it into small pieces, and handed a piece to each of Yang Yinghao and Yang Yingying, who were not polite and ate it directly.They had eaten scallion pancakes before, and they knew that this food was very delicious, so their little faces were full of smiles and satisfaction. They saw the envy of other children, and their eyes were shining when they looked at Mu Yan.Mu Yan couldn\u2019t bear the children\u2019s eyes looking at him the most, so he immediately distributed the remaining scallion pancakes to the children, one piece for each.If it is for adults, maybe those people won\u2019t eat it, but children are naturally curious and bold. Seeing Yang Yingying and Yang Yinghao eating so happily, they immediately started to eat too. Can\u2019t help talking about their own feelings in amazement, and the children\u2019s feelings are always very direct and real.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious, much better than nutrition powder.\u201d\u201cCrispy, delicious, Mom, I want to eat more, you buy it for me.\u201d A little fat man quickly finished his portion, and immediately pestered his mother to buy some back.There were quite a few children who were the same as the little fat man, and there were even some whose parents were unwilling to buy them, so they immediately lay down on the ground and burst into tears.Many parents were confused by their children, and the scallion pancakes smelled really good, so a few people came forward to inquire.\u201cHow much is it?\u201d\u201cOne for five credits.\u201d Mu Yan said weakly, still a little nervous.\u201cWhat? Five credit points?\u201d The young man who was the first to ask before suddenly widened his eyes, as if he couldn\u2019t believe it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - The scallion pancakes are crazyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMu Yan became even more nervous in an instant. Just as he was about to lower the price, he heard the other party say in a surprised voice: \u201cIt\u2019s only five credits, give me five credits!\u201dMu Yan was completely bewildered by the other party\u2019s reaction, and he used facial expressions to indicate that it was probably like this (?\u30070)This price was determined by him, Mu Chen and Yang\u2019s couple yesterday.In fact, when Mu Yan set the price at the beginning, he set it lower than the five credit points, because almost every family can make scallion pancakes in their place, and it is not worth a lot of money at all, but Mu Chen and Yang Wenyao listened to his price. , almost dropped his jaw.Fortunately, Mu Chen, Yang Wenyao and others stopped them. In their view, even a price of 50 credits is appropriate. After all, this has a trans-historical significance.\u201cFifty? No, no, that\u2019s too much.\u201d When Mu Yan heard the price, his reaction was similar to their reaction when they heard his price, except that one thought it was too much and the other thought it was too little.If it is really priced at fifty, Mu Yan is very worried that his scallion pancakes will not be sold at all, and everyone will definitely say that he is black-hearted. The most important thing is that in his opinion, scallion pancakes are not worth the price at all.The four of them discussed for a long time, and the price dropped again and again. Finally, at the value of five, Mu Yan reluctantly accepted, and Mu Chen, Yang Wenyao and others were also lost their temper by Mu Yan.The monthly salary of residents here is an average of 3,000 credits, and the cost of nutritional powder for a person per month is 1,000 credits, which is equivalent to 30 credits per day.An adult man may need about four sheets if he can eat all-you-can-eat scallion pancakes (according to the values of Mu Chen and Yang Wenyao), an adult woman needs about two sheets, and one sheet is enough for a child.Therefore, everyone can afford five credits for a scallion pancake, and many people even think that the price is very low.Just like the young man just now, he felt that the price was too good. After all, this is a new kind of food, and it smells very, very delicious. People can\u2019t help but want to try it. I thought the price would be very high. , it turned out that it was only five credits per piece, so what are you waiting for, before everyone reacts, hurry up and buy it!And those villagers who were still waiting and watching were naturally very pleasantly surprised when they heard the price, and they all rushed forward after realizing it.Such a delicious food is only five credits, which is simply too cheap. In other words, even if this food is not delicious, it is just a waste of five credits, not too much, not to mention the way those children eat, it should be It\u2019s delicious.Thus, such a scene appeared at the door of Mu Yan\u2019s house, and everyone kept pushing forward.\u201cGive me one.\u201d\u201cI want two.\u201d\u201cGive me one too.\u201dMu Yan looked at the villagers swarming up in front of him in surprise, and even forgot to move his hands.Mu Chen took the knife from Mu Yan\u2019s hand, then skillfully cut the scallion pancake into two from the middle, and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t accept the sale of the whole pancake, and each person can only buy half a pancake at most.\u201d\u201cWhy? Half a sheet is too little, not enough to eat at all.\u201d Someone raised an objection in dissatisfaction.\u201cThe number is limited and there are too many people.\u201d Mu Chen said concisely.The villagers in the back line were worried that they would be sold out when it was their turn, after all, the quantity was not large, but Mu Chen\u2019s words played into their hands, and they immediately agreed.\u201cGood things need to be shared with everyone. Xiaoyan doesn\u2019t make much. You bought them all, so what else should we buy? We can\u2019t be so selfish.\u201d For a bite to eat, customers are also very hard, even to Mu Yan The title also directly turned into a small word of intimacy.Mu Chen raised his head and glanced at the customer, then moved away, but the customer felt that he was being watched by some danger just now, which made him shiver uncontrollably.\u201cThat\u2019s right, everyone should try something new today. If you want to eat it, come back later.purchase. \u201c\u201cThe big boss is right. Everyone can taste half a sheet, so that more people can taste it.\u201d\u201cMu Mu is the boss.\u201d Mu Chen said lightly, which means that Mu Yan is the real boss, and he is just a guy who helps the boss.everyone\u2026\u201cAh Chen is also the boss.\u201d Mu Yan heard these words, and said subconsciously.Mu Chen did not refute.\u201cThen a big boss, a small boss, hurry up and give me half a piece, I can\u2019t wait to eat it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, the two bosses also give me half a ticket.\u201dPeople are such creatures that like to follow the crowd. No matter which world they are in, as long as there are many people, they like to go there. As long as there are many people buying things, even if they don\u2019t know what it is, they are willing to buy it back.The villagers in front heard everyone saying this, worried about making public anger, so they had no choice but to accept the sale of half scallion pancakes. Even the first customer to buy scallion pancakes, Mu Chen, was very selfless and cut five pieces into half.Holding half a cake, the young man felt very aggrieved, but when he saw Mu Chen\u2019s expressionless face, he immediately swallowed the grievance that came to his lips, and then walked to the side silently to eat the cake, and decided to change his mind. Feed on grief and indignationwant.As a result, after eating, I suddenly felt more stuffy.It wasn\u2019t because the scallion pancakes were bad, or because they were so delicious, that\u2019s why he felt that he was at a disadvantage. He could eat five slices to enjoy himself, but now he only had half a slice, and it was gone before he tasted it. It\u2019s not addictive at all, but it makes me even more itchy, and I can\u2019t wait to eat more.\u201cNo more.\u201d Mu Chen said lightly to the customer.\u201cIt\u2019s gone? It\u2019s sold out? How come it\u2019s gone? It\u2019s finally my turn.\u201d A young man looked at the empty table and didn\u2019t want to believe it.\u201cIt\u2019s gone? Are they all sold out? I haven\u2019t bought it yet?\u201d The people in the queue at the back immediately swarmed up again, looking at the empty tables, looking like they were about to collapse.\u201cHow can you do so little? It\u2019s not enough for everyone to buy.ah? \u201c\u201cI haven\u2019t tasted it yet, even if there is still a little bit, let me have a taste, okay?\u201d\u201cLittle Boss, can you get a few more copies? I\u2019ll buy one with ten credits. No, I can buy half a copy.\u201d Another customer who didn\u2019t buy it hurriedly said to Mu Yan.Mu Yan didn\u2019t expect this to be the case at all. He even thought that if he couldn\u2019t sell it, he would share it with his neighbors, but he didn\u2019t expect that it would be sold out in a short period of time, and there were even many people who didn\u2019t buy it. Still wanting it, it\u2019s just\u2026 It\u2019s beyond his imagination.\u201cNo more, please come early next time.\u201d Mu Chen said impatiently, then took Mu Yan who was still in a daze with one hand, dragged the table back to the courtyard with the other, and then walked back to the courtyard in front of all the customers. Face to close the door.\u201cOh, it\u2019s so delicious. I\u2019ve never eaten such a delicious thing. It\u2019s much better than nutrition powder. Next time I will definitely buy more.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that besides nutritional powder and nutritional supplements, there are edible things in this world. It\u2019s so delicious.\u201d\u201cHow wonderful life would be if we could eat such delicious food every day.\u201d\u201cI must work harder to make money, and next time I will buy dozens of copies at once, so that my family can also taste it.\u201dThe customers who bought the scallion pancakes ate it up on the spot, and some even deliberately showed off to those who didn\u2019t buy it. It looked like a beating, and the hands and feet of those customers who didn\u2019t buy it were itchy.The young man who was still distressed before, seeing so many customers who didn\u2019t buy, suddenly felt balanced, as long as he wasn\u2019t the most unlucky.The customers who didn\u2019t buy it were still unwilling to leave, wandering back and forth at the door of Mu\u2019s house, and after waiting for more than ten minutes, the other party had no intention of coming out, so they accepted the reality and planned to leave.Before leaving, someone thought of another question: \u201cJust now the big boss said that he will come to buy next time, when is the next time?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, when is the next time?\u201d After being reminded by this person, the others immediately realized this most important question.\u201cNo, I have to ask the little boss, so next time I have to come early, otherwise it might be sold out again.\u201dYes, now that I know the exact time, I have to come over an hour earlier. Someone secretly thought in his heart, but he was smart enough not to say it.It\u2019s a pity that there are not a few people who have the same idea as him, and everyone thinks they are smart.So, this day, the door of Mu Yan\u2019s house was knocked again, and there was a tendency to keep knocking without opening the door. In the end, Mu Chen came out with a dark face, scaring the customer almost to run away.\u201cThen, when is the next time the stall will go out?\u201d The customer who knocked on the door saw Mu Chen\u2019s gloomy face, and was so frightened that he stuttered.Although the other customers were not as serious as this person, they all swallowed secretly, and were very glad that the person who knocked on the door was not themselvesThis person in the little boss\u2019s house is really scary. The little boss is so soft and cute, but why does he live with such a gloomy Rakshasa? I don\u2019t know if he is usually bullied.\u201cTomorrow morning.\u201d Mu Chen threw down the four words, and immediately closed the door with a \u201cbang\u201d, almost flattening the nose of the customer who knocked on the door.People who haven\u2019t left yet get specific information, knowing that there will be a stall tomorrow, and their minds are immediately active.At this moment, Mu Yan in the door couldn\u2019t close his mouth when he saw the extra credit points on his personal terminal.\u201cAh Chen, look quickly, we have 95 credit points.\u201d Mu Yan held the personal terminal, and handed the number displayed on it to Mu Chen, smiling as brightly as the sun on his small face.Ever since Mu Yan got this personal terminal, the account balance column on it has always been zero. Today, there is finally a number other than zero. How could he be unhappy?This is the first income he has obtained through his own hard work, no matter in his previous life or now.Mu Chen looked at the two small numbers above, obviously compared with other people, they couldn\u2019t be less, but it still made the boy so satisfied and happy.Mumu is really easy to be satisfied and easy to raise.Moreover, the word \u201cwe\u201d completely pleased Mu Chen, and that expressionless face also showed an obvious gentle and pampering expression. If the customer who was scared just now saw it, he would think he was dazzledof.\u201cMu Mu is great, these numbers will get bigger and bigger in the future.\u201d Mu Chen said with a smile.\u201cWell, they said that they will come over to buy cakes tomorrow. How much do you think we will make tomorrow? Can forty sheets do it? Will it be too much?\u201d Mu Yan said excitedly. As he talked, he became less and less confident. , the voice is getting smaller and smaller, as if talking to himself.It\u2019s on the shelves, friends, hurry up and make the first order. Today there will be 18 chapters with nearly 60,000 words. It is absolutely fat and fat, so you must make the first order for Yaoyao. In the morning, two chapters per hour , I will post two chapters in two hours in the afternoon, umm, Jiang Zi made a happy decision~~~PS: Ask for a gift on the shelf\u2026~ Friends, brush up~~~~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 - buy together...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen selling scallion pancakes before, Mu Yan was always in a state of confusion, so Mu Yan didn\u2019t notice the looting of scallion pancakes from customers and the complaints from customers who didn\u2019t buy them, otherwise maybe there wouldn\u2019t be any Now that\u2019s the question.\u201cWell, it\u2019s too much, just the same as today.\u201d Mu Chen said, he didn\u2019t want his Mu Mu to be tired, especially because people who were not related to him were tired.\u201cWell, let\u2019s do the same as today, just make 20 pieces.\u201d Mu Yan said happily, if the 20 pieces are sold out today, then the 20 pieces should be sold out tomorrow.Therefore, those customers who are looking forward to buying a lot of scallion pancakes the next day will probably cry and faint in the toilet when they see the 20 scallion pancakes on the table. Of course, these are all later.After earning the first sum of money, Mu Yan was in a very good mood. Although the amount was not large, Mu Yan decided to take Mu Chen to the supermarket to do some shopping.Since Mu Chen decided to live in Mu Yan\u2019s house, he basically hasn\u2019t bought anything, and what he needs in daily life is all given to him by Mu Yan.After all, Mu Yan was penniless when he came to this world. This house was given by the village, and the daily necessities he used were bought for him by Uncle Yang and Aunt Lin. There is no way to add anything to Mu Chen.On the contrary, Yang Wenyao and Lin Jiayu once thought about buying some things for Mu Chen, but Mu Yan always felt embarrassed to take other people\u2019s things, so he tried to save as much as possible and share it with Mu Chen.Now that he finally has his own money, Mu Yan will naturally not let Mu Chen feel wronged anymore, although Mu Chen doesn\u2019t feel wronged like that before, but instead feels satisfied to be able to share all the daily necessities with Mu Yan.Since Mu Yan came to this world, the place he has visited the most is the forest, followed by Lin Jiayu\u2019s home, and he has hardly been to other places, especially the supermarket, which is his first time.Seeing a supermarket rich in items from another world, Mu Yan was stunned the first time he came in, just like Grandma Liu who entered the Grand View Garden.\u201cAchen, Achen, there are so many things here.\u201d Mu Yan felt that his eyes were about to be unable to move.Mu Yan, who looks like a bumpkin, may look very rustic to others, but to Mu Chen, he is straightforward and very cute.\u201cBasically, there are everything in the supermarket, but there are not many here. When I have a chance, I will take you to a bigger supermarket.\u201d Mu Chen said to Mu Yan with a doting smile.Although he doesn\u2019t have any memory now, subconsciously, he always feels that he has been to a supermarket with more items and richer items, and Mumu should be happier there.Perhaps, restoring memory is not a bad thing, Mu Chen thought silently.Mu Yan dragged Mu Chen to the supermarket, and when he saw something he didn\u2019t understand, he would ask Mu Chen, and Mu Chen patiently answered him one by one, neither of the two deliberately paid attention to why a person who lost his memory Will remember these so clearly.\u201cSee if there is anything you like?\u201d Mu Yan stood in front of the daily necessities shelf and said to Mu Chen.Although they don\u2019t have many credit points, it is enough to buy some daily necessities, because the prices of the items in the supermarkets here are very low.\u201cYou choose, I like what you buy.\u201d Mu Chen said with a smile, his eyes kept falling on Mu Yan.Mu Yan\u2019s little face suddenly turned red, and he didn\u2019t know whether it was because of this sentence or because of his burning gaze.Mu Yan hastily let his attention focus on daily necessities, not paying attention to Mu Chen.Although the small face is still hot, but Mu Yan carefully selects the daily necessities, each of which will go through multiple comparisons, and then choose the most cost-effective and most suitable for Mu Chen. Of course, he will also ask Mu Chen for his opinion, after all This is Ah Chen using.But every time I get answers like \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you like it\u201d and \u201cI like it if you like it\u201d.Every time Mu Yan would be teased and blushed, and then he would stop asking and make up his own mind directly, but this feeling made him more shy and sweet, like a wife picking something for her husband .\u201cThis toothbrush has very soft bristles and should be comfortable to use.\u201d\u201cThis tooth jar is very beautiful, and the material is not harmful.\u201d\u201cThis facial cleanser is extracted from natural plants, it is harmless to the human body, and it cleans very well. Well, then I want this.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Words like this kept coming out of Mu Yan\u2019s small mouth, the voice was not loud, obviously speaking for himself, or subconsciously expressing what was in his heart.\u201cThis towel is also very soft, it won\u2019t scratch your face when you wipe it, and it\u2019s very comfortable.\u201d Mu Yan put a towel on his face and rubbed it slightly, feeling the softness of the towel, and then put it in the shopping basket. Then continue to ramble to choose other items.Mu Chen looked at Mu Yan who was so careful and caring, the smile on his face never disappeared, making that already handsome face even more dazzling and alluring, the gentle affection in his eyes was almost overflowing. Everyone who sees it hopes that he can be the one being watched by him, what kind of happiness should that be.It took Mu Yan a long time to pick and choose, but Mu Chen didn\u2019t show any impatience, and stayed by Mu Yan\u2019s side the whole time, helping him carry the shopping basket, making some young couples or lovers who came to shop envious.\u201cLook at how patient and careful they are. They are looking at you, and I am reluctant to let you go shopping with me.\u201d A young woman saw Mu Chen working hard to accompany Mu Yan, and immediately felt dissatisfied with the young man beside her. upThe young man was suffering and couldn\u2019t tell, and he couldn\u2019t go against his wife\u2019s words, so he had to be criticized aggrievedly.\u201cWow, that guy is so handsome, and the one next to him is so cute, too. Xiao Gong is really spoiled by Xiao Shou. He helps Xiao Shou carry the basket, and he has such a gentle face. I\u2019m so tired of it.\u201d Another girl pulled Looking at his companion, he said excitedly.\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t expect to be able to see such a superb attack here. It\u2019s simply amazing, and I didn\u2019t come here for nothing.\u201d\u201cGod, look, look, Xiaoshou is blushing, blushing, it must be something Xiao Gong said, Xiaoshou is shy, so cute.\u201d The girl couldn\u2019t help but screamed again, worried that it would cause her Mu Yan and Mu Chen\u2019s attention immediately closed their mouths, and quietly peeped in their direction with an extremely excited expression.Mu Yan, who was still carefully selecting daily necessities, felt several eyes cast on him, which made him a little uncomfortable.\u201cAh Chen, I\u2019ve made my choice, why don\u2019t we go back.\u201d Mu Yan leaned close to Mu Chen and said in a low voice. He glanced around quietly, and found several people looking at them, and his small face immediately looked at them. Slightly flushed, feeling very embarrassed.\u201cYeah.\u201d Mu Chen would never reject any decision made by Mu Yan, not to mention that he had already noticed those gazes, although there was no malice, but he really didn\u2019t like others staring at his Mu Mu unscrupulously.On the way to the cashier, Mu Chen intentionally or unintentionally blocked Mu Yan behind him, blocking the hot eyes of those people, and at the same time made Mu Yan slightly relieved.However, it made the peeping people feel excited, especially the young women.\u201cAh, Xiao Gong is jealous, Xiao Gong\u2019s possessiveness is so strong that he completely covers Xiao Shou Shou, so he can\u2019t see it at all.\u201d\u201cThat little shou is so shy. I saw him blushing just now. He is so cute. I really want to go up and give him a hug.\u201d Another girl also said excitedly.Mu Chen glanced at the two girls intentionally or unintentionally, and instantly silenced the girls.When he got out of the supermarket, Mu Yan immediately forgot all the sights in the supermarket, looking at the shopping bag Mu Chen was carrying, he felt a sense of accomplishment.These are all chosen by him for Ah Chen.After returning home, Mu Yan hurriedly put all the daily necessities bought for Mu Chen into the bathroom, next to his own.Seeing the two people\u2019s daily necessities next to each other, Mu Yan\u2019s heart is sweet, so that they can wash together in the future.\u201cYanyan.\u201d No. 5\u2019s sad voice came from the side, breaking Mu Yan\u2019s sweet fantasy.\u201cNo. 5, you\u2019re awake.\u201d Mu Yan looked up at No. 5 and said sweetly.No. 5 felt even more heartbroken when he heard the words, it just took a nap after eating breakfast, but when he woke up, he found that his little host was gone, not only that, even the man was gone, so it My first thought was: that nasty man abducted his little host, and ran away together.Number five turned around in a hurry, and the soft hair on his body that had been groomed by Mu Yan exploded again, and the whole ball was covered by a kind of mania.In fact, there is a connection between the system and the host, but No. 5, who was frightened by his own brain supply, completely forgot about it. It wasn\u2019t until seeing Mu Yan and Mu Chen walking in talking and laughing that he realized that he was How stupid.Of course, the narcissistic No. 5 would never admit that he made such a low-level mistake. It must be because he was too worried about the little host, so he forgot it in a moment of excitement.However, even if the little host didn\u2019t run away with that man, it was a fact that they abandoned themselves to go out, and they must be punished for this, otherwise they would often abandon themselves in the future.No. 5 deliberately pretended not to see Mu Yan, and even turned his back to him with his little butt, so that the other party would realize that he was unhappy and come to coax himHowever, after waiting for one minute, two minutes, three minutes\u2026 ten minutes passed, and no one came forward to comfort him. This made Number Five\u2019s eyes widen in disbelief, and then saw Mu Yan smiled at those daily necessities with a full face, and he didn\u2019t even notice that he was in front of him!No. 5 was sad and angry, but the other party was still immersed in his own thoughts, all his emotions were in vain, and in the end it could only turn into mourning, and called Mu Yan on his own initiative.\u201cYanyan, why don\u2019t you leave me alone and go out with that man alone.\u201d Number five decided to get straight to the point, otherwise its little host might never realize his grief and anger.\u201cA-Chen doesn\u2019t have daily necessities. I took him to the supermarket to buy them. I saw you were sleeping, so I didn\u2019t call you.\u201d Mu Yan replied innocently.\u201cYou are my little host, you should have the closest relationship with me, why don\u2019t you wake me up, what if that man bullies you and becomes swollen when I\u2019m not around?\u201d\u201cNo, Ah Chen is very good and won\u2019t bully me.\u201d Mu Yan continued, but he also felt very warm about No. 5\u2019s concern.small theater:Customers: Why are there only twenty?Mu Chen: In order not to make my wife tired, I can only let you help herPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 - he has been coveting youPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cThat man is not good.\u201d He has been coveting you all the time, don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know, No. 5 added angrily in his heart, and the little host of his family was too slow to notice.\u201cNo. 5, Ah Chen is really good. You will know if you spend more time with him. You are my most important people. I hope you can get along well.\u201d Mu Yan said worriedly.No. 5 had a lot of opinions on Mu Chen before, but he felt that since Mu Chen couldn\u2019t see No. 5, even if there were some small conflicts, it shouldn\u2019t be a big problem.But as time goes by and everyone gets along longer and longer, No. 5 keeps saying bad things about Mu Chen in his ears. bigAlthough it was only a unilateral conflict on No. 5, as he could see the existence of these two people, he still felt a bit awkward in the middle. Why couldn\u2019t No. 5 get along well with Ah Chen? Obviously Ah Chen is a very good person. .Therefore, Mu Yan decided to let No. 5 spend more time with Ah Chen. I believe that No. 5 will be able to see Ah Chen\u2019s goodness.So next, Mu Yan and Mu Chen, who were originally inseparable, became even more sticky now, and No. 5, who had been following Mu Yan, became even more depressed. Every time I saw these two people sticking together, It couldn\u2019t help but want to separate them, but no matter what it said, the little host didn\u2019t listen anymore, and instead let it look at Mu Chen more.Damn, it sees what that man does, and it doesn\u2019t like that man, really, can\u2019t it hide if it can\u2019t separate? At worst, it goes to other places, and it is pure if it is out of sight.However, No. 5 is still too naive, because it really can\u2019t escape. Whenever it wants to leave, Mu Yan will stop it and let it spend more time with Mu Chen, which makes No. 5 almost go crazy. , but facing the innocent and lovely face of his little host, he couldn\u2019t say anything, and could only sulk alone.As before, Mu Yan reconciled the noodles one night in advance, and then got up early the next day, planning to make all the scallion pancakes early, but when he finished washing and was about to go to the kitchen, he heard a rustling outside the door. There was a rustling sound, as if someone was talking.Mu Yan suddenly became nervous, his eyes were fixed on the door, and his ears were pricked up to listen carefully. There was indeed someone talking.The heart was so frightened that it started beating wildly, this kind of beating was completely different from the beating that Mu Chen had seen before, which made him a little stiff.\u201cAh, Ah Chen\u2026\u201d Mu Yan called Mu Chen\u2019s name in fear, his voice was as weak as the buzzing of mosquitoes, and there was a deep cryHe wanted to call Mu Chen, but because of fear, he couldn\u2019t move his body at all, and he couldn\u2019t even control his voice.However, at this moment, the originally pleasant voice sounded in Mu Yan\u2019s ears like the sounds of nature: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m here.\u201dHearing the familiar voice, Mu Yan instantly felt confident and relieved, at least his body could move. He turned his head immediately and saw that familiar face.\u201cAh Chen, there are people outside.\u201d Mu Yan\u2019s small hand unconsciously grabbed Mu Chen\u2019s lapel.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, I\u2019m here.\u201d Mu Chen\u2019s voice was comforting, at least Mu Yan listened, and the fear in his heart really eased a lot.Mu Chen walked towards the gate, wanting to see the situation outside, although Mu Yan was very scared, but he didn\u2019t want Mu Chen to face it alone, and followed behind.At this time, the sky was not yet completely bright, and the door opened in a hazy state. Several figures appeared in sight, and even vaguely could see the astonished expression on the other party\u2019s face. It seemed that they did not expect the door to open at this time.\u2013 At that time, neither of them spoke to each other, it was extremely quiet.In the end, the people outside the door reacted first, with a surprised expression on their faces, and said excitedly: \u201cIs the big boss going to start selling scallion pancakes? I came here before dawn to line up.\u201dThe person who spoke was one of those who didn\u2019t buy scallion pancakes yesterday. In order not to repeat yesterday\u2019s mistakes, he hurried over before dawn and queued up. After a few minutes, several people rushed over Come here, apparently with the same thoughts as him.At this time, this person was extremely grateful that he had made this decision, otherwise he would come back at dawn, there might be a long queue in front of him, and he might not be able to buy it again.When the other people heard what this person said, they immediately looked at Mu Yan and Mu Chen with bright eyes, and said, \u201cI want to buy five, but I bought half of them yesterday, and I didn\u2019t enjoy it at all. Give me.\u201dMu Yan and Mu Chen didn\u2019t say anything, but the people behind this person started to yell: \u201cYou actually bought it yesterday? Since you\u2019ve eaten it all, why come here and line up? I didn\u2019t see that everyone hasn\u2019t eaten yet.\u201d Have you tried it?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right, we haven\u2019t tasted it yet, since you have eaten it, go to the back and don\u2019t block us from the front.\u201d\u201cSo what if I bought it before, it was here when I came here, if you want to go ahead, come here sooner next time.\u201d The person who bought it said, sticking his neck.\u201cLittle boss, how much do you plan to make today, I want five, no, I want ten!\u201d Another person hastily ordered.\u201cLittle boss, I want ten too, and keep ten for me.\u201d\u201cHey, hey, you\u2019re all too much, the ones in front of you want so many, what can you do to the people behind?\u201d The people in the back were not happy, and hurriedly said to Mu Yan: \u201cI want two Ten!\u201d\u201cCut!\u201d As soon as the person behind said that, he immediately got N eyes of contempt.Mu Yan stared dumbfounded at everything in front of him. He hadn\u2019t even started to make this yet, but in the end, more than 40 pieces of scallion pancakes were reserved, and this was only for three people. Unexpected.And most importantly, he was worried that it would not be sold out, so he only mixed the nutritional powder enough to make 20 scallion pancakes. If he is making cakes with noodles now, it may be very late to make them.This is how to do?\u201cToday there are still only 20 cakes, half a cake per person at most, those who are dissatisfied can do it themselves.\u201d Mu Chen said coldly, regardless of how those people reacted, he directly closed the door with Mu Yan, leaving the outside The group of customers in the morning breeze\u2026 messed up.After hearing the bad news, it took a long time for the customers outside to react, so they immediately exploded.However, the first reaction of customers is not to dislike Mu Yan, who do too little and sell too little, but\u2026\u201cThe little boss said that there are only 20 tickets. If one person has half a ticket, they can only be sold to forty people. Now there are so many people who didn\u2019t buy it yesterday. Since you bought it yesterday, you have to give up the opportunity. If you haven\u2019t bought one, go back and sleep before dawn.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. We haven\u2019t tasted it yet. If you line up in front, we will have one less person to taste it. You can\u2019t be like this and don\u2019t know how to share.\u201dThe people in the back line began to besiege the people who bought it in front one after another, and they worked hard enough to get it for themselves.And those who were in the front were even more thankful that they came early, no matter what happened in the back, they would definitely be able to buy half of the tickets, although there were very few, it was better than nothing.\u201cEven if I got it, it was from yesterday. I came early today and queued up early. Why should I give up the opportunity to you? My parents haven\u2019t eaten it yet. I came here to buy it for them.\u201d Before that Those who bought it choked on their necks and choked on others.There are still a few people in the team who also bought scallion pancakes yesterday, and they came to line up early today. They tried their best to reduce their sense of existence, and they were afraid that those people would target them again. They are not as good as the previous person cheeky.In the end, the person who was attacked by the artillery fire did not leave, and he still stood firmly in his position, waiting for the door of Mu\u2019s house to open for a while, which is enough to show that he has true love for scallion pancakes.Others have nothing to do when they see this, but luckily I still have a quotaWhen the line got longer and longer, and when the number of people reached forty, the people in front began to kindly (xuan) heartily (yao) remind the people behind.\u201cDon\u2019t come here and wait in line. The little boss said that today we still only provide 20 cakes, half a cake per person at most, which is only enough for 40 people to buy.\u201dWhen the people behind heard this, they nervously began to count the number of people in front, and silently prayed that the number of people in front of them would not be forty.Of course, these wooden words who are making scallion pancakes don\u2019t know.When Mu Chen pulled him in, Mu Yan was still dizzy, feeling that his brain was not enough. He was worried that the twenty cakes might not be sold, but it turned out that not only could they be sold, but they were doubled. There were still people who wanted it, and the most important thing was that those people were already queuing up at the door before dawn, all of this was too unexpected for Mu Yan.\u201cAh Chen, are they really here to buy scallion pancakes?\u201d Mu Yan still didn\u2019t believe it, so he had to confirm with Mu Chen, as long as A Chen said yes, he would believe it.\u201cWell, the scallion pancakes made by Mu Mu are delicious and very popular.\u201d Mu Chen touched Mu Yan\u2019s small head and said with a smile.\u201cSo it\u2019s all true.\u201d Mu Yan believed it, and put a smile on his face. He was really happy that someone liked what he made.\u201cThey said they want a lot of scallion pancakes, so is it not enough for us to prepare today, or am I going to make some nutrition powder?\u201d After Mu Yan was happy, he thought of the quantity everyone wanted, and was a little worried.Everyone likes the scallion pancakes he made. He is very happy, but everyone wants a lot. If he can\u2019t finish it, everyone will be disappointed.\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine. Each person will try something new with half a sheet. If they don\u2019t eat enough, they will continue to come to buy next time. If they eat too much at one time, they will not come next time if they are satisfied.\u201d The pure Mu Yan was jumping around, if the group of customers outside the door who were vying for qualifications to buy scallion pancakes heard it, they would try their best to roll their eyes at him at the risk of being frozen to death by Mu Chen.There is never too much of them!However, Mu Yan still thought it made sense, and was completely fooled, and looked at Mu Chen with sparkling eyes, \u201cAh Chen, you are so amazing.Seeing this, Mu Chen wanted to hug him into his arms and knead him well. Fortunately, he had strong self-control and controlled himself, otherwise he would feel distressed if he scared someone.Afterwards, Mu Yan made twenty scallion pancakes every day and sold them at the door on time. After the group of people robbed them the next day, Mu Yan finally realized how popular his scallion pancakes were, and he no longer worried about making too many. Will not sell.The third is deliveredPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 - System UpgradePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe task schedule in the system is also progressing steadily. Although it has not been concluded that how many scallion pancakes can withstand the flour, it is very happy to be able to grow Mu Yan, because there is finally hope that it can be completed. up.The scallion pancakes made by Mu Yan also became popular in the entire Taohua Village at the fastest speed, and occasionally even people from nearby villages came here admiringly.For a while, all the nearby villages knew that there was a person in Taohua Village who could make delicious food that was not nutritious powder but could satisfy hunger, and more people came to Muyan to buy scallion pancakes.Logically speaking, according to this speed, the system upgrade task should be completed soon. The progress bar of the early stage task is indeed not slow, but it gradually slows down a lot later, because most of the scallion pancakes behind are made of wood. Chen came to do it.Mu Chen felt sorry for Mu Yan, who got up early every day to make cakes, and would help him share whatever he said.In fact, Mu Chen is willing to help him, Mu Yan is still very happy and moved, although the progress of the task will be slower, but his heart is sweet.Compared with the sweetness in my heart, the system upgrade speed doesn\u2019t seem to care so much.number five\u2026Has its innocent little host been taken away by the big bad wolf? I don\u2019t even care about system upgrades, fall! Mu Chen is indeed a disaster!However, even though No. 5 is indignant, it doesn\u2019t dare to speak ill of Mu Chen directly in front of Mu Yan. After all, the previous \u201clesson\u201d can be vividly remembered, and it doesn\u2019t want to be tied to that man all day long.It even started to reflect, is it because it always said bad things about Mu Chen, gave Mu Yan a chance to prove that Mu Chen is a good person, and then pushed its little host to that man\u2019s side, which caused the current situation? Case?To be honest, Number Five really doesn\u2019t want to believe that there is still a piece of it in it.creditForget it, let\u2019s just leave it like this, so that the host can relax a bit, isn\u2019t it just that the upgrade is slower, and it\u2019s not that it can\u2019t be upgraded, the generous No. 5 doesn\u2019t care about this time~ I),I don\u2019t know how many scallion pancakes I made, the system\u2019s upgrade progress bar finally came to an end, and the familiar cold voice sounded again: \u201cDing, the system has been upgraded to level two, one reward recipe and one lucky draw chance.\u201dAlthough the mechanized voice was still cold, it was very pleasant to Mu Yan and Number Five\u2019s ears.\u201cYanyan, we have been promoted to level two, let\u2019s see what the level two recipe is?\u201d Number five circled around Mu Yan excitedly.Mu Yan clicked on the backpack, and there were two paper-like things in it, one of which was the recipe for scallion pancakes, which showed that it had been opened, and the other was a new recipe given by upgrading to the second level.But as usual, Mu Yan still didn\u2019t know the characters above, and No. 5 couldn\u2019t help but said with a big face: \u201cYan Yan, you have to take some time to learn how to read, although the people here are generally not well-educated, but they are also literate.\u201d Yes, complete illiteracy is still rare.\u201d\u201cWell, I see, Ah Chen seems to know how to read, I will go to him to learn later.\u201d Mu Yan said with a smile.Number Five wanted to say something, but was afraid of self-defeating, so he shut up and focused on the new recipe.\u201cYanyan, the recipe presented this time is steamed stuffed buns. There are only the steps of making steamed bun skin and the required materials, but there are no requirements for the fillings. That means we can make steamed stuffed buns with any fillings.\u201d After reading it, No. 5 was excited Said that in this way, the buns will be much easier to make\u201cI can make steamed stuffed buns.\u201d Mu Yan said excitedly. He also made steamed stuffed buns when he was at home before. Although he only made a small amount during the Chinese New Year, he still had some contact with them.\u201cDing, release the second-level task, complete a thousand buns, you can upgrade to the third level, and get a chance to draw a lottery.\u201d The system sounded, and Mu Yan and No. 5 were not surprised.Number Five: Hehe, with the experience of last time, I won\u2019t make foolish mistakes this time.\u201cThe main material of steamed stuffed buns is still flour, but I guess nutritional powder should be possible too, after all, it can be used when making scallion pancakes, but besides that, there is another difficulty here, that is, we don\u2019t have anything for fermentation, and we don\u2019t know Can the nutrition powder be fermented? It is better to find the wheat as soon as possible.\u201d Number Five said.During this period of time, they did not give up their search for wheat. Every time they went to the forest, they would focus on finding some plants similar to wheat, but the figure of wheat was still nowhere to be seen.\u201cFermentation? In the past, we used old noodles to make steamed buns, but people here don\u2019t eat them at all, so what should we do if there is no old noodles?\u201d Mu Yan was confused.\u201cIn fact, in addition to the old noodles, it is also possible to have baking powder. There is baking powder in the system, but\u2026you need points to exchange.\u201d After the fifth said, the voice became weaker and weaker, because they had just changed the system because of the system upgrade. The previously owed points were repaid and changed from negative to zero, but after this change, they were about to become negative again.Alas\u2026 No. 5 sighed deeply, feeling so far away from them.Mu Yan didn\u2019t think about it so much. He heard No. 5 said that there is baking powder in the system, which can solve the problem of fermentation, so he stopped worrying about it. As for the problem of points, he probably never thought about it.\u201cThen change to a pack of baking powder.\u201d Mu Yan said.Egg No. 5 looked at the points that had just reached zero, and felt heartbroken at the thought of being in debt again.Suddenly, No. 5, who has always been relatively stupid and cute, had a flash of inspiration in his head, and his small bean-like eyes shone brightly. He said excitedly to Mu Yan: \u201cYan Yan, isn\u2019t our upgrade this time a reward for a chance to draw a lottery? We Let\u2019s draw a lottery, maybe you can get baking powder or points.\u201d\u201cLucky draw?\u201d Mu Yan opened the system page, and under the guidance of No. 5, he found the location of the lottery draw. Then, with a single click, the screen of the lottery draw began to scroll, and the text on it flashed quickly, making people dazzled.After that, the scrolling speed of the text on the lottery screen slowed down, getting slower and slower, and No. 5 stared at the lottery page more nervously, muttering incessantly: \u201cBaking powder, points, baking powder, points, fermentation Fans, points\u2026\u201d\u201cDing, congratulations to the host for obtaining a bag of growth-accelerating fertilizer.\u201d The system voice sounded again.\u201cIt\u2019s not baking powder and points.\u201d Mu Yan was probably influenced by No. 5, and was a little disappointed when he heard the results reported by the system.However, No. 5 seemed quite excited, and said to Mu Yan: \u201cYanyan, this chemical fertilizer is a good thing. You can use a little bit of it when you plant the land in the future, and it will make the crops grow faster and better. Your luck!\u201d really not bad.\u201d\u201cReally? That\u2019s good.\u201d Hearing this, Mu Yan\u2019s depressed mood picked up.\u201cBut if this is the case, the yeast powder can\u2019t be exchanged.\u201d After finishing speaking, No. 5 directly exchanged the yeast powder, and then the points column became negative again. They still need to work harder to earn points.Soon, No. 5 put these troubles behind him, and asked Mu Yan to make buns for him, so it was much more fun to say that the stupid and cute.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s make minced meat with shiitake mushrooms today.\u201d Mu Yan thought about the ingredients he had, and then quickly settled for today\u2019s dinner.meal.The wild boar hunted by Ah Chen still has some meat left, which is just right to make stuffed meat with shiitake mushrooms.\u201cAh Chen, how about we eat steamed buns stuffed with mushrooms and meat tonight?\u201d Mu Yan walked out and saw Mu Chen making wooden cabinets in the yard.Their house is relatively empty, with no furniture, or the simplest and improvised, but they will live here for a long time in the future, so Mu Chen will make some furniture by himself to fill the house when he finds time.Whenever Mu Yan saw Mu Chen making furniture, he would have the illusion that they were living their lives.As a man, Ah Chen would contract some rough work for the family, and as a husband, he would cook for him every day. The two of them also ran a small business, and their lives were ordinary and warm.And this is the life that Mu Yan most yearns for.\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Chen replied with a gentle smile, \u201cYou\u2019ve done well.Hearing this, Mu Yan\u2019s face blushed, and then he got into the kitchen and started tinkering with his buns.According to the instructions read on the 5th, Mu Yan soaked the yeast powder with warm water, then added it to the water for kneading noodles, kneaded the nutrient powder into a dough, covered it with a layer of cloth for fermentation, and then began to adjust the filling.Mu Yan chopped the shiitake mushrooms into fine pieces, and then began to chop the meat. The meat is more difficult to handle, and it takes effort and time to finely chop them.The sound of \u201cdong dong dong\u201d as the knife touched the chopping board continued to resound, spreading throughout the yard.Holding a big knife, chopping for a while will make your arm sore, stop for a while, and then continue to chop, of course, when Mu Yan stopped for the second time, the big knife in his hand was taken by a big hand stretched out from behind, Even the task of chopping meat was \u201crobbed\u201d in the past.Mu Yan turned his head and saw a broad and solid chest, raised his head slightly, and saw Mu Chen\u2019s handsome face.Because Mu Chen stood behind Mu Yan, his whole body seemed to wrap Mu Yan in it, and Mu Yan could even smell the faint scent of a man coming from the other person, as well as the breath sprayed by a man.Mu Yan\u2019s small face suddenly turned red, red and hot, and there was a constant numb feeling from the place where he was in contact with Mu Chen, like small electric currents, which kept running around in his body, making him head a little dizzy\u201cI, I can\u2026\u201d Mu Yan stammered nervously, his little hand stretched out to take back the meat-chopping knife, but it directly covered Mu Chen\u2019s hand, the warm temperature seemed to be scalding. The water made Mu Yan withdraw his hand in an instant, and his whole body was so hot that it was about to smoke.\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d Mu Yan apologized in a panic.No. 5 couldn\u2019t hold back his face in the void. Couldn\u2019t his little host be a little promising? Isn\u2019t it just touching hands? As for such a strong reaction?And that face, what are you blushing about! Red what! It\u2019s going to explode when it\u2019s red, hey! Number five simply hates iron for being weak.Even if it can\u2019t prevent its little host from being taken away by the big bad wolf, at least it must teach its little host to be the one above, and it must not be led by the nose by the big bad wolf.That\u2019s right, let his little host become the leader, so that the man can only obey his little host, No. 5 made up his mind silently in his heart.\u201cThis knife is very heavy, I\u2019ll chop it for you.\u201d Mu Chen still maintained the posture of circling Mu Yan, and replied briefly, his eyes glanced at the void, with coldness in his mouth.The fourth is deliveredPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - Buns stuffed with shiitake mushroomsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cThis knife is very heavy, I\u2019ll chop it for you.\u201d Mu Chen still maintained the posture of circling Mu Yan, and replied briefly, his eyes glanced at the void, with coldness in his mouth.Although he quickly took it back, No. 5 still saw it, and was startled immediately, and quickly left the kitchen as if fleeing, completely forgetting the great determination it made just now.\u201cThen, then I\u2019ll go and see what\u2019s going on with the face.\u201d Mu Yan felt the constant warmth from the other party, and felt that if this continues, he might be directly warmed by the other party\u2019s warmth. , it would be embarrassing.The corners of Mu Chen\u2019s mouth slightly raised, seeing Mu Yan\u2019s embarrassed and shy expression, he became in a good mood, worried that teasing him would backfire, so he let him go appropriately.Leaving Mu Chen\u2019s embrace, Mu Yan quietly breathed a sigh of relief, secretly ignoring the loss in his heart, then ran to the basin of the nutrition powder, and checked the fermentation of the nutrition powder.Nutritional powder has more functions than Mu Yan imagined. After replacing flour, it is not only stronger than flour, but also faster and better than flour when fermented.In just a short period of time now, the dough for the nutritional powder has grown several times larger than before, and the entire basin is almost unable to hold it.Mu Yan stretched out his hand and poked the nutrition powder. He felt that it was almost fermented, so he poured out the whole pot of nutrition powder dough, covered it with a layer of nutrition powder to prevent it from sticking to his hands, and then began to knead the dough, kneading it into a big dough. White and fat, very gratifying.Cut a small piece from the big dough, and Muyan wrapped it well, and used it as the old dough that will act as the baking powder in the future.Then cut another piece, pinch it into a long cylindrical shape with both hands, and then cut it into medium-sized doses, flatten each dose with the palm of your hand, and roll them into small round cakes with a rolling pin , thin on both sides and thick in the middle, so the bun skin is ready.On the other side, Mu Chen\u2019s meat has also been chopped. Seeing this, Mu Yan couldn\u2019t help but lament the essential difference between a brother and a man. If he were to chop the meat, it would probably take more than twice as long. Maybe the size of the chopping is uneven, how can it be finely chopped like it is now.Mu Yan mixed the meat and shiitake mushrooms together, then added a little salt, oil and pepper, and placed it next to the chopping board, which is more convenient for wrapping.Mu Yan picked up a round dough, scooped up some fillings with a spoon and put them in the middle of the bun skin, then flipped his fingers and began to wrinkle them flexibly. After a while, a white, fat and pleasant bun was on Mu Yan\u2019s side. Hands were born.In a short period of time, Mu Yan has skillfully wrapped several buns, Mu Chen has been standing by the side watching, and then joined the ranks of making buns.At the beginning, Mu Chen\u2019s movements were relatively unfamiliar, so Mu Yan patiently instructed him how to wrinkle and how to wrap the edges. Soon, Mu Chen became more and more proficient in doing it, and his speed was not even lost to Mu Yan.\u201cWow, Ah Chen, you are so good, you make the buns so fast.\u201d Mu Yan couldn\u2019t help admiring when he looked at the buns on the curtain that were of the same size as if they came out of the same mold.Even if they are the veterans who know how to make buns the most, the buns they make are not as good-looking as Ah Chen\u2019s. Ah Chen is indeed the best.A sense of pride rose in Mu Yan\u2019s heart.Because of Mu Chen\u2019s joining, the speed of making buns is much faster, and all the nutritional powder that has been sent out is quickly finished, and the buns are neatly arranged on the curtain, which makes people feel very happy. Have an appetite.The steamer for steaming steamed buns is also provided by the system, but these were all included when the kitchen utensils were exchanged for the first time.Put the steamed buns on the steamer and start to heat up the fire. After about 20 minutes, Mu Yan checked the doneness of the steamed buns. He reached out and patted the steamed buns. It was no longer sticky, which meant that the steamed buns were cooked and ready to serve. The pot is gone.Of course, Mu Chen did the cooking process. After all, the temperature was very high when the pot was first started. Mu Chen was worried that it would burn Mu Yan, so he took over the job himself.The moment the steamer was opened, the fragrance of pasta burst out immediately, making the mouth watering, and even No. 5, who was scared away by Mu Chen before, flew back.\u201cYanyan, Yanyan, is Baozi ready?\u201d No. 5\u2019s eyes were fixed on Baozi. Although the shape and appearance were somewhat familiar, it did not affect its appetite.Mu Yan looked at No. 5, looking at the steamed stuffed bun, and then at No. 5. He couldn\u2019t help covering his mouth and chuckling. If No. 5 was placed in the middle of the buns, if he didn\u2019t look carefully, he might not be able to find him. .\u201cAchen, try it and see how it tastes?\u201d For the first time, Mu Yan ignored No. 5\u2019s begging for food, but handed the first bun to today\u2019s biggest hero.Mu Chen was not too polite, took the bun, took a bite, the skin was thin and filling, full of fragrance, the thick meat and the fragrance of mushrooms complement each other, plus the blend of bun skin, oily but not greasy, very delicious.Even though he has eaten many meals made by Mu Yan before, Mu Chen still feels amazing when eating this bun.He never thought that a small nutritional powder combined with other ingredients could make so many different flavors of food, which made him feel like the first few decades of their lives were all in vain.Of course, Mu Chen is not alone who feels this way, most of the customers who have eaten the scallion pancakes made by Mu Yan think so.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201d Although Mu Chen only gave a three-word evaluation, Mu Yan knew that this was already a very high evaluation from Mu Chen. If he said it was delicious, it meant it was really delicious.So he happily took one and took a bite. The fragrance was still sweet with the dough, so he couldn\u2019t help but eat one after another.In the past, during Chinese New Year, my family would also make steamed buns, but the quantity was limited, and I often gave them to my father and younger brother. It was already very good for him to eat one and taste it. How can I eat as much as I am now? enjoyable.No. 5 saw Mu Yan and Mu Chen eating happily, but no one noticed it, and immediately became anxious, ignoring that Mu Chen was still here. all overOil.Mu Chen glanced at the steamed stuffed bun that was bitten off out of thin air, and continued to eat as if he didn\u2019t see anything.\u201cAh Chen, what do you think of us starting to sell buns tomorrow?\u201d Mu Yan was full and satisfied, and finally remembered the business.After selling the scallion pancakes for more than a month, Mu Yan felt that everyone should be tired of eating them (everyone: no!), if the taste changed, maybe more people would come to buy them, and he also wanted to make more steamed stuffed buns It\u2019s better to upgrade.It was originally discussed that it would only be sold at the market, but when the scallion pancakes were sold, people would come and queue early every day.So it became to do some sales every day. Anyway, the quantity is not too much, and it is not tiring to do it, and it does not delay picking other jobs, so Mu Yan persisted.\u201cEverything you cook is delicious, and they will like whatever you do.\u201d Mu Chen said dotingly.\u201cThen let\u2019s make more steamed buns and sell them tomorrow. Originally, if we had rice, we could make some porridge and sell them together. It\u2019s best to eat steamed buns and drink porridge.\u201d Mu Yan recalled the snack bars that he saw in town before. The breakfast here is basically steamed buns with porridge, or some tofu nao.It\u2019s a pity that he hasn\u2019t encountered any of these, neither rice nor soybeans, so he can only think about porridge or tofu nao for the time being, and of course he doesn\u2019t know how to make tofu nao.Even though they didn\u2019t stir-fry any dishes for this meal, everyone still ate very satisfyingly, their stomachs were as round as before, and they were not as promising as before, so full that they couldn\u2019t even walk.Number five was lying limply on the curtain, unable to fly at all, the whole ball was like a big bun.After about half an hour, his stomach finally felt less full. Mu Yan stood up and walked back and forth to speed up his digestion. Then he delivered the noodles for tomorrow and adjusted the fillings.This time, Muyan made two kinds of fillings, one is meat filling with mushrooms and pork, and the other is vegetarian fillings with mushrooms and amaranth, so that people who like different tastes can choose.The pork is still chopped by Mu Chen. Mu Chen is chopping the meat here, and Mu Yan is kneading the noodles and adjusting the vegetarian stuffing on the other side. Neither of them spoke, and the whole kitchen only had the sound of chopping meat. , but the picture is unusually harmonious.The next day, when Mu Yan woke up and came to the kitchen after washing, he found that Mu Chen had already wrapped many buns, and suddenly, his misty eyes woke up.\u201cAchen, why do you get up so early?\u201d Mu Yan looked at the pot of minced meat that almost bottomed out, which shows how early the other party got up.\u201cI couldn\u2019t fall asleep, so I got up. I\u2019ve almost finished wrapping one pot, and the time has been cut in half. You can go to sleep again. When I finish wrapping the other pot, I can just go out of the stall.\u201d Mu Chen smiled and wanted to knead. Rubbing Mu Yan\u2019s smooth hair, but seeing the nutrition powder in his hand, he gave up the idea.Mu Yan shook his head and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll pack it with you.Although today will be finished some time earlier, how could he leave Mu Chen to make buns by himself and go to sleep by himself.Mu Chen didn\u2019t try to persuade them either, the two of them made buns one by one and rolled dough by the other, and cooperated with each other, the cooperation was perfect, even the timing was very accurate.The work was completed an hour earlier than usual, so Mu Yan also decided to open the door for sale earlier. Anyway, there are already many customers lined up at the door.After the name of the scallion pancake was announced, many people from the nearby villages would also come here admiringly.Scallion pancakes have always been limited, and the villagers of Taohua Village often quarrel with people from other villages because of this. They dislike them for taking up the limited quota of purchases, and some people can\u2019t buy them at all.Therefore, every time people from other villages come to Peach Blossom Village, the villagers of Peach Blossom Village act as if they are facing a big enemy, and they are unanimous. Villagers, the first team is from other villages.When the first cage of buns was steamed, Mu Yan picked up the buns into the small wooden basket that had been prepared, then covered them with a white cloth, and asked Mu Chen to carry them out and put them on the table for sale.Mu Yan was not very good at dealing with customers, and in his previous life, men were basically the ones who showed up in public, so Mu Yan naturally gave up this job to Mu Chen, while he concentrated on it. in the curtainrear.When Mu Chen came out with the familiar wooden basket, those customers who were still arguing were suddenly as excited as chicken blood, and stood in front of the table one after another, without any organization, and started to line up spontaneously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

My family eats that one every day. Half a piece is not enough for our family.\u201d A middle-aged man said shyly.\u201cMy family is the same. Every time I buy it back, my son is snatched away.

They had never seen a bun before, and they stared at it like bumpkins.steamed stuffed bun:\u2026\u2026\u201cToday there are no scallion pancakes, only steamed stuffed buns, three credits order one, limited to three per person.\u201d Mu Chen said expressionlessly.Most of the people who come here to line up to buy are old customers, and they have long been accustomed to Mu Chen\u2019s appearance.\u201cWhat are buns? Is it as delicious as scallion pancakes?\u201d A customer standing in the front row asked, and everyone else listened with pricked ears.Mu Chen didn\u2019t answer, but picked up a steamed stuffed bun, gently broke it in half, revealing the rich fillings inside, and the fragrance instantly increased several levels, and the few customers in front of him couldn\u2019t help but drool . \u201cGive me three.\u201d\u201cI want three too.\u201dThe customers in the front line couldn\u2019t wait to talk, while those behind could only look at the dwindling buns and worry.\u201cYou all buy less, that\u2019s all, you bought all of them, what about the rest?\u201d\u201cOh, if I knew it was selling steamed stuffed buns today, I would have come earlier, so I would definitely be able to buy them.\u201d\u201cOh, slow down, there are not many buns.\u201dThe customers in the queue at the back looked anxious, wishing they could jump in line and buy one now.The steamer that Mu Yan uses to steam the buns is not big, after all, it is a family pack, so there are only about 20 buns in a basket, and they are all sold out in a short timeThose who didn\u2019t have their turn looked at the empty wooden basket with mournful expressions on their faces, looking hopeless, and those who bought buns couldn\u2019t wait to eat them on the spot.\u201cGood time, it\u2019s really delicious.\u201d After taking a bite, the soft bun skin and rich fillings came together in the mouth, it was so delicious that one wanted to bite off one\u2019s tongue.\u201cIt\u2019s really delicious, the little boss is really amazing, how did he think about how to make it, how can it be so delicious.\u201d\u201cIf I can eat these every day, I would be happy to spend all my salary on buns.\u201dThe people who bought the buns kept admiring while eating them, and those who saw the buns who didn\u2019t buy them were complaining and wanted to beat people up.\u201cTen minutes for the next pot.\u201d Fortunately, Mu Chen spoke at the right time, thus avoiding the fate of those who bought the buns from being beaten.As soon as they heard Mu Chen\u2019s words, those who didn\u2019t buy it immediately regained their energy, and immediately stared at the door of Mu\u2019s house eagerly, wishing to stare at a big hole, so as to see the big white and fat bun inside.The people who bought the buns were completely immersed in the deliciousness of the buns. When they looked back, they found that they had eaten all three buns, and they were shocked Z(\u00b0\u25b3.\u4e28II)\u4e28If you don\u2019t bring something back, your wife/mother/son/daughter will definitely not spare them, so the men who did something wrong hurriedly went to the end of the line again, praying in their hearts that they could be on the turn. Last time.Customers who didn\u2019t have their turn: Hehe, I\u2019ve finished eating, and I want to buy again, dreaming!The second pot of steamed buns came out, and they were sold out in a short time. The customers who bought the steamed stuffed buns hurried home, lest they couldn\u2019t help themselves and started eating halfway. The results of the first batch of customers just now They saw it, and they were worried that if they couldn\u2019t hold back, they would end up like them.A total of six cages of steamed stuffed buns were made that day, more than one hundred. Basically, the customers who came came to take turns. It took more than two hours. By the time they were all finished and sold, the sun had already risen high.Mu Yan looked at the increased value on the personal terminal, and his mood was very bright. The daily income of this steamed stuffed bun is much more than that of scallion pancakes. Although it is very tiring after steaming six steamed buns, it is worth it.\u201cVery happy?\u201d Mu Chen asked with a smile.\u201cEn.\u201d Mu Yan nodded his head vigorously.\u201cLater, we\u2019ll go to Master Liu\u2019s house to order a large steamer, and we can steam dozens of them at one time, which will save more than half of the time.\u201d Mu Chen suggested.When Mu Yan heard this, his eyes lit up immediately, he looked at Mu Chen adoringly, and said, \u201cAh Chen, you are really smart, I didn\u2019t even think of thisMu Chen enjoyed Mu Yan\u2019s admiration very much, and the curvature of the corner of his mouth became bigger.After tidying up the kitchen utensils and eating some steamed buns, the two walked towards Master Liu\u2019s house.Master Liu is a carpenter in the village, and his craftsmanship is very good. Many people in the village have made furniture for him. And they needed a big wooden steamer this time, so they thought of Master Liu.Mu Yan was talking to Mu Chen while walking, basically Mu Yan was talking and Mu Chen was listening.Although Mu Chen didn\u2019t talk much, he always had a faint smile on his face, and one could see his pampering and pampering towards Mu Yan at a glance.There was a young girl not far from the two of them, looking at the two talking and laughing, strictly speaking, she was watching Mu Chen.The girl\u2019s appearance was very delicate, with curved willow-leaf eyebrows, a tall Qiong nose, small cherry lips, and delicate makeup on her face, which made her look even more beautiful.The girl clenched her fists tightly, as if she had made a lot of determination, she walked towards Mu Chen Muyan.\u201cHi, my name is Yang Ping, I like you, can you be my boyfriend?\u201d Yang Ping looked at Mu Chen and said bluntly, blinking at him, her long eyelashes are like the wings of a butterfly , flickering, with a blush on his face.Ever since Mu Chen appeared in front of the public, she had noticed this man, his handsome appearance almost instantly moved her heart, and she fell in love, and from that moment on, she recognized him.She has never seen such a handsome man, even the most handsome man in the village or even the town standing in front of Mu Chen will be compared to the dirt, and she is the most beautiful girl in the entire Peach Blossom Village. She is the most suitable woman for Mu Chen, she has this confidence.However, Mu Chen didn\u2019t even look at Yang Ping, took Mu Yan\u2019s little hand, bypassed Yang Ping and continued walking.Yang Ping\u2026Not reconciled, Yang Ping walked around in front of the two of them again, purposely puffed up her proud chest, and looked straight at Mu Chen. She didn\u2019t believe that there was anyone who could resist her charm. You know, people in the village who liked her But they can all be discharged outside the village.Mu Yan saw that this woman stopped in front of them time and time again, and just confessed to Mu Chen, which made him nervous instinctively, and the little hand holding Mu Chen suddenly tightened, and his gaze was fixed on Yang. Ping, always be on guard.Mu Yan looked at the other\u2019s high breasts, and immediately shuddered. It was the first time for Mu Yan, who had traveled from a world where there were only brothers and men, to observe a woman so closely. The man\u2019s figure made him really incompetent, and he couldn\u2019t figure out why there were such strange people in the world.However, when Mu Yan\u2019s sight and expression fell into Mu Chen\u2019s eyes, it became that he had feelings for the woman in front of him, and a strong fire suddenly ignited in his heart, and he took a step forward, completely blocking Mu Yan from looking at her. Yang Ping\u2019s sightYang Ping didn\u2019t notice the dark turbulence between Mu Chen and Mu Yan, but thought that Mu Chen\u2019s actions were interesting to her, and her expression immediately became more proud.\u201cGet out!\u201d Mu Chen\u2019s thin lips parted lightly, and his gaze towards Yang Ping was even more icy cold.\u201cWhat?\u201d Yang Ping felt that she had an auditory hallucination, and no one would say that word to her.\u201cI\u2019ll let you go!\u201d Mu Chen felt that his anger was about to rush to the top of his head, and he wished he could directly burn the girl who stood in his way.Now Yang Ping heard it clearly, but her eyes widened and she couldn\u2019t believe that someone really said this word to her, and it was a man.Mu Chen didn\u2019t bother to pay attention to this inexplicable woman, and pulled Mu Yan away quickly again.Yang Ping didn\u2019t step forward to block this time, because she hadn\u2019t recovered from the blow just now.Mu Yan didn\u2019t speak along the way, but carefully observed Mu Chen secretly. He remembered that men in this world would marry women, and the woman just said that she liked Ah Chen, so did Ah Chen also like her? Woolen cloth?If Ah Chen falls in love with women in the future and marries another woman, will he leave him?When Mu Yan thought of this, his heart ached. He really wanted to tell Ah Chen not to leave, he really wanted to tell Ah Chen that he could marry him and have a baby for him, but\u2026 he didn\u2019t dare.He doesn\u2019t know whether men in this world can have babies, and he doesn\u2019t know whether Ah Chen can accept being with men, but obviously in their place, it\u2019s only natural for a brother and a man to be together, but when he came to this strange world, but not everyone can accept itThe more Mu Yan thought about it, the more he felt wronged, and his mood became more and more depressed.Even though Mu Chen was angry because he was jealous, but that anger was only aimed at Yang Ping, he couldn\u2019t bear to vent his anger on Mu Yan even a little bit,It was even the first time he discovered Mu Yan\u2019s depressed mood.\u201cMu Mu, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Mu Chen stopped, looked at Mu Yan and asked\u201cAchen, will you find a woman to marry and have a baby in the future?\u201d Mu Yan lowered his head and asked in a low voice, his voice couldn\u2019t be lower.\u201cDo you want me to marry a woman?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d Mu Yan almost didn\u2019t even think about it, and replied subconsciously.\u201cThen I won\u2019t find a woman to marry.\u201d Mu Chen replied indulgently, all the anger because of Yang Ping\u2019s appearance before dissipated.Mu Yan always felt that this conversation was a bit familiar, as if it had happened before, but he couldn\u2019t remember it, but he was still very happy after hearing Mu Chen\u2019s answer, and immediately threw all other thoughts out of his head.\u201cMu Mu, since you don\u2019t want me to find a woman to marry, then only you are responsible for me.\u201d Mu Chen said half-jokingly, half-seriously.Mu Yan\u2019s little face suddenly turned red, and his little hands were glued to each other nervously. Seeing this, Mu Chen just wanted to say \u201cI\u2019m joking\u201d, but he heard the other party say softly and softly in a very, very small and firm voice: \u201cI, I will take responsibility for you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - i'm in lovePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMu Chen\u2019s eyes instantly became deep and dark, like a small black hole, attracting the person he was watching into.\u201cMu Mu, do you know what you\u2019re talking about?\u201d Mu Chen used the greatest self-control to barely control himself, let himself calm down, and asked Mu Yan seriously, confirming again.Mu Yan bravely raised his head to meet Mu Chen\u2019s gaze, looking at the handsome face that always made his heart beat out of rhythm, resisting the urge to bow his head because of shyness, nodded very seriously, and said: \u201cI ,I knowMu Yan\u2019s words finally defeated Mu Chen completely, no matter how powerful his self-control was in front of Mu Yan, it was futile.Originally, Mu Chen planned to wait until Mu Yan grew up, he was confessing his love, and then tied the person to him completely, but he did not expect that an inexplicable person who suddenly appeared today would make him feel like this Big surprise.\u201cMumu, I love you.\u201d Mu Chen confessed affectionately.That\u2019s right, what he said was not \u201cI like you\u201d, but \u201cI love you\u201d. From the moment he was rescued by Mu Yan, he had a good impression of the boy in front of him. , that initial goodwill gradually evolved into liking and love, even he himself couldn\u2019t explain how it changed, but when he realized it, he had already connected all his future plans with Mu Yan.Mu Yan\u2019s eyes widened in surprise, his heart was full of touch and sweetness, it was sweeter than the honey he ate by chance before, it was so sweet to his heart.\u201cI, I love you too.\u201d Mu Yan responded shyly.He had always fantasized that one day he would meet a man he liked and liked him, and then marry him, have a baby for both of them, and live an ordinary and warm life together.Even in a different world, this wish still exists deep in Mu Yan\u2019s heart, but he never thought that this wish would come true so soon.Perhaps at the beginning, he had a traditional thinking about Mu Chen, but as he got along with each other, his feelings gradually changed, just like Mu Chen gradually fell in love with Mu Yan while getting along. ,WoodThe same goes for words.Mu Chen couldn\u2019t bear it any longer and hugged him tightly into his arms. The thin Mu Yan just fit into his broad chest, and the seams fit perfectly.Mu Chen lowered his head, looked at Mu Yan whose face was blushing, stretched out his hand to caress the other\u2019s cheek, raised his chin slightly, looked at the seductive red lips, and pressed it down.He has long wanted to taste the taste of Mu Yan\u2019s lips, but unfortunately he was afraid of scaring him before, so he has been patient, and now he can finally taste it openly.The four lips touched each other, first they caressed each other carefully, feeling each other, and then they violently attacked the city, the body fluid exchanged, and the breath blended.It was not until Mu Yan was out of breath that Mu Chen reluctantly let go of the slightly red and swollen lips that had been ravaged by him, and Mu Yan had to rely on Mu Chen to barely support his limp legs.\u201cWe won\u2019t go to Master Yang\u2019s place today, shall we go back first?\u201d Mu Chen\u2019s deep and slightly hoarse voice sounded beside his ears, with a trace of temptation and danger.Mu Yan\u2019s mind was already in turmoil, what Mu Chen said, he nodded subconsciously, unable to think at all.Holding the cute, cute and cute Mu Xiaoyan, Mu Chen is in an unprecedentedly good mood, and even feels that it is a good decision to live on this backward planet for the rest of his life.When the two returned home, Mu Chen did not rush to do such and such shameful things to Mu Xiaoyan as everyone thought. Even though Mu Chen wanted Mu Yan to want to explode, he still respected She loves Mu Xiaoyan and will wait for him to grow up a little bit, to grow up a little bit.In the interstellar era, the lifespan of human beings has generally been extended a lot, and the lifespan of ordinary people can reach two hundred years. They still have a lot of time to do intimate things in the future, so Mu Chen warned himself not to rush for a while.Even if they don\u2019t go any further physically, the young couple who just confessed their love will feel very happy and sweet even if they just sit together for a day.On this day, Mu Yan hardly did anything, just sat in the yard and watched Mu Chen busy.It\u2019s not that Mu Yan is lazy, but because whenever Mu Yan wants to do something, Mu Chen will rush over, and then take over his work, and let Mu Yan sit on the rocking chair and bask in the sun.Therefore, in order not to let Mu Chen get tired from taking on too much work, Mu Yan had no choice but to bask in the sun obediently and watch Mu Chen busy.In fact, Mu Chen has wanted to do this for a long time. He was worried that if he did too much, he would scare Mu Yan. After all, in his eyes, Mu Mu is timid and sensitive. Back to his protective shell, and now that he is his boyfriend, doing these things is a matter of course.It can be seen from this that Mu Chen\u2019s loyal dog attributes are fully exposed.Sitting on the small table next to the rocking chair, No. 5 stared at those small bean eyes, which were full of disbelief.It just took a lazy nap, and the two of them just went to Master Liu\u2019s house, what happened in it that it doesn\u2019t know? Why are the two getting along so strangely after they come back?Hey hey, who the hell, don\u2019t you laugh anymore, don\u2019t think that your pretty smile can cover up your wolfish aura, I can feel it, what did you do to my little host?Hey, little host, can you fight a little bit, no one here said anything, why did you look at that man blushing?Number five was going crazy, it couldn\u2019t figure out what happened to these two people at all.\u201cNo. 5, I, I\u2019m in a relationship.\u201d Mu Yan said to No. 5 with a blushing face.Number Five is his first closest partner after coming into this world, so he wants to share his joy with Number Five.Number Five: Z(\u00b0A.|||)|\u201cWhat, what? Are you in a relationship? With whom!\u201d Number Five was extremely shocked, his tone became higher and higher, and finally he almost roared out.Damn it, which **** actually abducted its cute little host while it was not around. If it finds out, it must not be spared lightly! Number Five thought inwardly indignantly.Mu Yan didn\u2019t answer directly, but looked at Mu Chen who was busy in the yard, Hanchun\u2019s little expression was obvious, how could No. 5 not notice it.\u201cI knew it, I knew it!\u201d No. 5 turned around violently. It had long realized that its cute little host might be taken away by that big bad wolf Mu Chen, but it never expected that it would be so quick.Ahhhhh! It\u2019s abominable!\u201cNumber Five, are you unhappy?\u201d Even the dull Mu Yan could hear the irritability in Number Five\u2019s teeth-gritting tone, and the mood that originally wanted to share joy was instantly poured with a bucket of ice water.Number five hastily restrained the leaked emotions, because it found that it seemed to scare its little host, and just about to say something, it felt a very cold gaze projected over it.Looking up, just in time to see Mu Chen looking at him in a sinister manner, No. 5 was taken aback, and the feeling that the other party could see his existence ran out again.No, no, it is an intelligent system from a higher plane, and it is impossible for anyone other than the host bound to it to be able to see it.Mu Chen just glanced coldly at the existence in the void, when he looked at Mu Yan, his expression had already become gentle, how could he still see the coldness of the previous second.Although Mu Chen has been busy with work, his attention has always been on Mu Yan.Mu Yan\u2019s mood changes, even a little bit, he can notice immediately, so just now Mu Yan\u2019s mood changed from joy to depression, he saw it all.Although there was no third person in the whole yard except him and Mu Yan, he intuitively felt that the change in Mu Yan\u2019s mood was due to something invisible.This is not the first time he has this feeling, he knows that Mumu must have a secret to hide from himself, although the feeling of being concealed is not good, but he will not ask Muyan to share it with him, after a period of time Observing, he knew that that thing would not hurt Mu Yan, so he didn\u2019t take it to heart.He will wait for the day when Mu Yan takes the initiative to confess to him.\u201cWhat do you want to eat at noon?\u201d Mu Chen squatted beside the rocking chair, asked with a smile, his voice was soft, his expression was gentle, and the people he watched always had a feeling of being drowned in it.\u201cEverything is fine.\u201d Mu Yan replied in a low voice, and when he looked at Mu Chen, he immediately remembered the person\u2019s confession before, and then his face began to steam, his heart began to beat wildly, and his voice became quieter unconsciously. , completely out of control.\u201cThen how about we eat steamed stuffed buns and chicken with stewed mushrooms and fried amaranth for lunch? I\u2019ll make it.\u201d Mu Chen helped Mu Yan tuck the blanket covering his body, and said.\u201cwell.\u201dMu Chen leaned over and pressed a kiss on Mu Yan\u2019s forehead, which successfully made Mu Yan\u2019s head confused, and completely forgot the cold water poured by No. 5 just now.Mu Chen rubbed Mu Yan\u2019s little head in a funny way, then glanced at the blank space on the table, and said in a low voice: \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are, but if you make Mu Mu sad again, don\u2019t blame me for being rude.\u201dNo. 5 was immediately frozen, and his body was so stiff that he didn\u2019t dare to move. Even though he knew that the other party couldn\u2019t see him, he still didn\u2019t dare to move. It wasn\u2019t until Mu Chen turned and left.\u201cYanyan, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t do it on purpose just now.\u201d No. 5 hurriedly apologized to his little host. It was indeed that he failed to control his emotions and scared the little host just now.In fact, he is not really opposed to Mu Yan and Mu Chen falling in love. If the little host of his family really insists on choosing someone to fall in love with, this person is really Mu Chen who is the most suitable person. After all, they have lived together for a long time, and their personalities I also understand everything, and the most important thing is that Mu Chen is also very kind to his little host.\u201cI, I was just a little uncomfortable just now. I always felt that the man took away Yanyan, so I lost control. In fact, if Yanyan has to choose someone, Mu Chen is still very good.\u201d Number five said incoherently. She explained that she just hoped that its little host would not be really angry with it.Hearing this, Mu Yan\u2019s mood really improved again, it turned out that number five was just not used to it.That\u2019s right, in the past, No. 5 often didn\u2019t get along with Ah Chen. As long as they get along more often, they should understand what a good person the other party is.\u201cA-Chen is very good, you can get to know him by spending more time with him.\u201d Mu Yan kept praising Mu Chen, and told No. 5 how good Mu Chen was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Mu Yan thought that tomorrow he would continue to use a small steamer for a day, and then go to order.As a result, before it was dark, there was a knock on the door. Mu Yan walked over to open the door, only to find that it was Master Yang standing outside.\u201cMu Yan, is your family Mu Chen here?\u201d Master Yang asked with a smile, looking very kind.\u201cAh Chen, Master Yang is here.\u201d Mu Yan hurriedly went to call Mu Chen.Mu Chen came out of the kitchen and was not surprised to see Master Yang.\u201cMu Chen, it\u2019s amazing. The blueprint you gave me is amazing. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve made something like this. Although I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s for, it looks amazing.\u201d Master Yang There was a long list of openings, and he kept sighing, and Mu Yan was at a loss when he heard it.\u201cMaster Yang has won the prize, that blueprint was created by Mumu.\u201d Mu Chen replied.\u201cOh, Muyan is very powerful. Do you have any other blueprints? If you still need them, you must come to Uncle Yang. Uncle Yang will give you a discount.\u201d Master Yang said with a smile, and then asked Beckoning, let the apprentices move in the finished things.Mu Yan looked at the familiar object that had been magnified several times, and couldn\u2019t help being stunned.\u201cMaster Yang, thank you for your hard work.\u201d Mu Chen thanked him, then sent him out, and when he came back, he saw Mu Yan circling around the big steamer in amazement.\u201cAh Chen, when did you go to Master Yang to do it?\u201d Mu Yan still hadn\u2019t realized it yet. Didn\u2019t they go home halfway? Then how did Master Yang know? Could it be a prophet?\u201cI went there after lunch.\u201d Mu Chen explained, and lightly tapped Mu Yan\u2019s little head.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, I didn\u2019t even notice it.\u201d Mu Yan said with glowing eyes, and he was even more satisfied when he looked at the big steamer.In fact, Mu Chen didn\u2019t plan to go there at first. According to his idea, the next day without a big steamer, the sale would be stopped for a day, but thinking of Yi Muyan\u2019s character, I\u2019m afraid even if he used a small steamer, he wouldn\u2019t let those customers wait in vain. In order not to tire Mu Xiaoyan, he had no choice but to take time to visit Master Yang\u2019s house and order a large steamer.With the help of the big steamer, Mu Yan made more steamed buns the next day, of course, most of them were made by Mu Chen, and the customers who came to buy them also returned with full rewards and satisfaction.In the past two days, nearly 400 steamed buns have been made. Mu Yan opened the system panel, but the progress bar of the task is only a little bit, and the value has only increased by 50. According to this speed, I am afraid that there will be more and more tasks. More buns to complete the task.\u201cAlas\u2026 all the steamed buns made by Mu Chen were wasted, otherwise it would definitely be over a hundred now.\u201d No. 5 looked at the progress bar of the system and said distressedly.Obviously they have made so many steamed stuffed buns, but the value added in the end is pitifully small, except that because nutrition powder is used instead of flour, it takes a few steamed stuffed buns to increase a value, but the bigger reason is this. Most of the steamed stuffed buns were made by Mu Chen, if Mu Chen\u2019s share could also be counted, then their task would definitely be done faster.\u201cBound Ah Chen as a partner, so it\u2019s fine if Ah Chen did it?\u201d Mu Yan said suddenly.\u201cNo!\u201d No. 5 refused without thinking.\u201cWhy?\u201d Mu Yan asked, he and Ah Chen had confirmed their identities as partners, as long as the marriage ceremony was held and completed, they would be lifelong partners, shouldn\u2019t it be possible to be bound as partners?Although a long time ago, Mu Yan thought about hiding the system from his future partner, but at that time, the partner was just an imagination to him, he could not imagine what the relationship with his partner would be like, it might last a lifetime Respect each other as guests, after all, many of them came here like this.However, ever since he identified Mu Chen, his thoughts on his partner have changed. It turns out that partners can also get along like this, and they can also have such a strong relationship, so strong that he can\u2019t wait to share all the secrets with his partner, including the system. , including his life experience.\u201cYou can\u2019t guarantee that Mu Chen will be so kind and loyal to you all his life, if he changes his mind, then you will be in danger.\u201cWhy did you change your mind in the middle? Aren\u2019t we already partners?\u201d Mu Yan was puzzled.Where he lives, although many brothers and men are married not because of emotional foundation, but since they are married and become partners, the possibility of separation is very small, and there are very few cases of separation, so Mu Yan Can\u2019t understand the meaning of divorce and cheating.\u201cEven if you are a partner, you may change your mind and terminate the partnership.\u201dNo. 5 doesn\u2019t know how to explain to Mu Yan. He knows that Mu Yan\u2019s world is very conservative. Once they become partners, they seldom break up. But this world doesn\u2019t have to be. There are many people there, not to mention there are many cheating in marriage.In this world, the most elusive thing is the human heart, no matter how good Mu Chen is to Mu Yan now, who can guarantee the future?Mu Yan did not continue to discuss this issue with No. 5. Mu Yan has his own views and persistence on the matter of getting married and partnering.No. 5 didn\u2019t continue to indoctrinate Mu Yan with these things, because it knew that Mu Yan was very simple, and didn\u2019t want too many complicated things to pollute his simplicity.One person, one system accidentally achieved harmony. As for whether the content of this harmony is the same, it is unknown.From Mu Yan\u2019s point of view, he and Ah Chen have confirmed their status as a couple, and then they can determine the date of engagement and marriage.In their place, the man\u2019s family needs to find someone to come to the brother\u2019s house to give the dowry, and then the two parties agree on the time of engagement and marriage. When they get married, the brother will marry the man with his own dowry, and from then on they will form their own small family.However, Mu Yan came to this strange world alone, and he has no immediate relatives here, so he can\u2019t let his parents discuss the marriage date with the Hanzi\u2019s family.Let him discuss with Mu Chen by himself? I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to be overwhelmed by his shyness before he can figure out why.Therefore, Mu Yan entrusted everything to Mu Chen. Like him, Mu Chen was alone, but as a man, the other party should be more generous and thick-skinned than his elder brother, so he took the initiative to raise the issue of the date of marriage. It should also come from a man.In the past few days, Mu Chen found that Mu Yan would always look at him with extremely eager and expectant eyes from time to time, and when he looked over, he would turn his eyes away with a blushing face and dare not look at him. He was so itchy that he looked so real.However, after a few days like this, Mu Chen found that Mu Yan\u2019s gaze towards him had changed again, it was no longer eager, but a lot more resentful and aggrieved, which made him a little confused, and immediately reflected on whether there was something wrong with him. The place did it wrong, or ignored the other side.However, Mu Chen thought over and over again all the things he did in the past few days, but found nothing.Finally, Mu Chen couldn\u2019t bear it any longer, and went directly to Mu Yan. He decided to ask straight to the point, absolutely not allowing any misunderstanding between them. The most important thing was that such Mu Yan would make him feel distressed.\u201cYanyan, it seems that you are not in a high mood these days, is it because you are not feeling well? Or did I do something wrong?\u201d Mu Chen carefully hugged him into his arms and asked softly.Mu Yan shook his head, bit his lower lip lightly, what should he say about this matter?In the past few days, he thought that Mu Chen would come to him to discuss the wedding, but after waiting for several days, he didn\u2019t see that the other party had any intention of mentioning it, which made him a little flustered, but as a thin-skinned brother, he If you don\u2019t have the courage to ask directly, you can only grieve silently.Mu Chen grabbed Mu Yan\u2019s shoulder, made him look at him, and said with a serious expression: \u201cYan Yan, since we are already together, don\u2019t let the misunderstanding destroy our relationship, you don\u2019t mind what you have to say. It can be said directly, if I have done something wrong, it is fine for you to blame, beat and scold, but don\u2019t hold it in your heart alone, okay? I will feel distressedMu Yan looked at Mu Chen who was so worried and cared about him, his heart was very moved, warm, and gave him great courage, and then with Mu Chen\u2019s encouragement, he said what he thought in his heart: \u201cAh Chen, you ,Do you still like me?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Mu Chen almost didn\u2019t think about it, subconsciously replied, and then confessed affectionately: \u201cI like you, I like you the most.\u201dIt must be that he didn\u2019t do enough, making his Mu Mu feel insecure, Mu Chen reflected on himself in his heart.\u201cThen, why don\u2019t you marry me?\u201d Mu Yan finally uttered the question in his heart, because of shyness and embarrassment, he wished he could put his head directly into Mu Chen\u2019s embrace.When Mu Chen heard the words, he was stunned for a rare moment and didn\u2019t realize it. It took him a long time to ask uncertainly: \u201cMu Mu, what did you say just now?\u201dIt can\u2019t be blamed that Mu Chen is so restless, he really didn\u2019t expect Mu Yan to be sad for so many days because of this.Naturally, it is impossible for Mu Yan to tell Mu Chen, the first time he was so shy that he wished he could find a crack in the ground, don\u2019t expect him to say it brazenly now.However, Mu Chen didn\u2019t intend to really listen to Mu Yan again, he just didn\u2019t dare to confirm it, worried that he had auditory hallucinations, but now he has confirmed it, and the ecstasy in his heart can\u2019t be concealed at all.\u201cMu Mu, are you really willing to marry me?\u201d Mu Chen looked at Mu Yan straightforwardly, and secretly pinched himself, fearing that he was dreaming.He may have some background before he lost his memory, but now he has nothing. He lives in Mu Xiaoyan\u2019s house, eats the ingredients Mu Xiaoyan found, and uses the money Mu Xiaoyan makes. But without Mu Xiaoyan, his life would not be as comfortable as it is now.To put it bluntly, he is now relying on Mu Xiaoyan for support.Xiao Gong is taken care of by Xiao Shou, SahuaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 - be proposedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn fact, Mu Chen wanted to marry Mu Yan very much, but he was worried that he would not be able to give Mu Yan a comfortable life with nothing, and he would not be worthy of Mu Xiaoyan, so he thought about waiting until he had a career, and when he had something If she has enough ability, she will come to marry Mu Xiaoyan, but she didn\u2019t expect\u2026the other party would \u201cpropose\u201d first.Mu Chen is both excited and annoyed now, obviously he should do these things, but because of his own negligence and lack of self-confidence, he let Mu Mu do it, what\u2019s more, he actually made Mu Mu sad.\u201cYeah.\u201d Hearing Mu Chen\u2019s proposal, which didn\u2019t look like a marriage proposal, Mu Yan agreed in a low voice, feeling shy inside.\u201cMumu, don\u2019t worry, I will definitely give you an unforgettable wedding. I will love you, protect you, and love you for the rest of my life.\u201d Mu Chen promised firmly and earnestly.Because of his shyness, Mu Yan shrinks himself even smaller, the whole body is shrunk into Mu Chen\u2019s broad arms, a small one can easily be hugged full.So, when Yang Wenyao and Lin Jiayu learned that Mu Yan and Mu Chen were together, they were already talking about marriage, and the speed of that made them unable to recover for a long time.Yang Wenyao directly called Mu Chen out with a dark face, while Lin Jiayu stayed to talk to Mu Yan about himself.Although Lin Jiayu is a woman, she has always regarded Mu Yan as her family and her junior, so she doesn\u2019t feel awkward when talking with Mu Yan.\u201cYanyan, have you really thought it through? You are only sixteen years old now, and you are still underage. It\u2019s too early to get married now.\u201d Lin Jiayu said tactfully.In her opinion, Mu Yan is still very young, and his understanding of feelings is still not perfect. What should he do if he meets someone else he likes in the future?Although nowadays people can get divorced even if they are married, but divorce is always bad, and the relationship should be consistent, so she thinks it\u2019s better to wait for Mu Yan to really recognize her feelings before talking about marriage.\u201cNo, it\u2019s getting late, we already have babies my age.\u201d Mu Yan said shyly, although Aunt Lin\u2019s gender here is the same as his in their world, but facing Aunt Lin, he Still feel embarrassed.Moreover, at his current age, he should have gotten married and had a baby with them a long time ago. It\u2019s really not too early.Lin Jiayu was a little surprised when she heard the words. She didn\u2019t expect that the place where Mu Yan came from was even more backward than theirs. It\u2019s not impossible, it is said that long, long ago, their ancestors were able to marry and have children in their teens.Lin Jiayu also stopped persuading Mu Yan. After all, persuasion is not persuasion, and she can see that Mu Yan likes Mu Chen very much. Now it depends on Mu Chen\u2019s attitude. On purpose, they don\u2019t mind being part of their family to witness the wedding of the lovers.On the other side, Yang Wenyao faced Mu Chen with a dark face from the beginning to the end, his appearance was like a father-in-law marrying a daughter facing a future son-in-law, no matter how you look at it, it is not pleasing to the eye.Mu Chen also bravely looked directly at Yang Wenyao, he knew that the Yang family saved Mu Yan, which was a special existence for Mu Yan, no less than the existence of his natal family.\u201cI won\u2019t say much else, I\u2019ll just ask you, what should you do if your memory suddenly recovers and you find that your family background is rich and you already have a partner or a marriage partner?\u201d Yang Wenyao asked very bluntly.This problem is actually the biggest problem between Mu Yan and Mu Chen at present, because no one can guarantee what kind of person Mu Chen was before or what the family situation was like. It must be Muyan.Mu Chen\u2019s thin lips were slightly pursed, his eyes were dark, obviously he was thinking about this issue seriously, and then he said firmly: \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t remember the past, I can be sure that my feelings for Mumu will never be because of change anything!\u201d\u201cThen what if you already have a family?\u201d Yang Wenyao continued aggressively.\u201cI\u2019m sure, I\u2019ve never been married before!\u201d Mu Chen said firmly, although there is no basis for this affirmation, but his intuition is so determined, \u201cEven if I was really married, I will definitely not let Mu If Mu gets hurt, I will take care of everything, and if Mu Mu is willing, I will live here with him for the rest of my life.\u201dWhen Yang Wenyao heard the words, a look of confusion flashed in his eyes, and he said, \u201cAre you willing to live with Yanyan on such a backward planet for the rest of your life? There is no high technology, no interstellar network, and no favorable living conditions.\u201d\u201cIt was Mu Chen who said very firmly without any hesitation.Mu Chen doesn\u2019t think there is anything wrong with living on such a backward planet, as long as he is with Mu Mu, he will feel very comfortable there and enjoy it.Yang Wenyao has always been very accurate in judging people, he knew that what Mu Chen said was the truth, he said and thought the same way.She stepped forward and patted him on the shoulder, saying: \u201cI bless you all, I will leave Yanyan to you in the future, you must treat him well, and don\u2019t let him be wronged, otherwise, I will never forgive you lightly.\u201d\u201cThere won\u2019t be such a chance.\u201d The two smiled at each other, keeping everything in silence.The marriage between Mu Yan and Mu Chen was settled in this way, because neither of them had family members, so Lin Jiayu started to help them with their daily life. Lin Jiayu took care of everything in terms of the choice of wedding supplies and the matters that need attention. helped them consider it.People in Taohua Village also heard the news, and came to congratulate them one after another, especially those who were conquered by Mu Yan\u2019s buns and scallion pancakes, they would congratulate once a day when they came to buy buns.\u201cBoss, congratulations. When we get married, don\u2019t forget to treat us to a wedding wine.\u201d A customer said with a smile while holding the buns he bought.\u201cEn.\u201d Mu Chen replied lightly.Customers have long been used to Mu Chen\u2019s indifferent attitude, and they don\u2019t care, but there are also new customers who don\u2019t know, and feel that he is a bit indifferent\u201cWhen people say congratulations to him, why is his attitude so cold, he doesn\u2019t know how to smile, and those who don\u2019t know think he is dissatisfied with the marriage.\u201cA newcomer couldn\u2019t help but said to the people around him.\u201cOh, the big boss is like this. Except for the small boss, he has this attitude towards everyone. We have long been used to it. You will get used to it after a few more visits.\u201d The companion enlightened him with a smile.\u201cThen his future partner can bear his indifference?\u201d That person imagined that his future partner always looked at him with a cold face, and felt completely unbearable.\u201cHe is very kind to the little boss. He is so gentle and doting in front of the little boss, tsk tsk tsk\u2026 People who have not seen it with their own eyes can\u2019t imagine it. Only when facing the little boss, he will melt the iceberg.\u201cThat\u2019s right, I guess all his tenderness and expressions are given to the little boss, so other people can only see him like this.\u201d Another person also joked.The newcomer still can\u2019t imagine what the tenderness that everyone said looks like. He always feels that if a person is cold, he will treat everyone like this. He can\u2019t imagine what his gentle expression looks like, okay?But soon, the new customers saw the scene that everyone said.Mu Yan came out with a pot of freshly steamed steamed buns, and then the new customer was very lucky to watch a live version of the iceberg melting scene, only to see Mu Chen who was originally cold, his eyebrows and eyes were gentle in the blink of an eye. Looking at Mu Yan, he took the steamed stuffed bun bowl that the other party was holding, and asked for warmth carefully. He looked so eager to hold the other party in his hand that he was afraid that he would lose his fear, and his fear would melt in his mouth. The new customer was dumbfounded for a while.\u201cHaha, did you see that? This is differential treatment.\u201d The old customer laughed and joked, and occasionally teased the little boss a few words, and then saw the little boss blushing, and the big boss looked coldly, and laughed even wider.Soon everyone realized the ultimate meaning of extreme joy begets sorrow.\u201cStarting tomorrow, the business will be closed!\u201d Mu Chen said in a cold voice, no matter how everyone wailed, he coaxed Mu Yan into the house, quickly finished wrapping the buns for the customers, turned around neatly, left, closed the door, and stayed behind. A crowd of wailing customers.\u201cAh Chen, I think we won\u2019t sell buns from tomorrow, I want to go to the forest to find more ingredients.\u201d Mu Yan discussed with Mu Chen.Their wedding date was set in two months, and that day was an auspicious day for Lin Jiayu to find someone to test. Mu Yan and Mu Chen were very satisfied with it.Mu Yan thought, this is the wedding he has been looking forward to for a long time, and he is getting married with the person he likes. The wedding banquet must be held well, so that all the customers who come are happy and return with satisfaction.Therefore, Mu Yan plans to use this time to find more edible ingredients, and then make them at the wedding banquet for those customers who come to the wedding to taste.In fact, there is only one wedding ceremony in this world. Even if there is a banquet, it is just for everyone to communicate with each other and there is no food. But in Mu Yan\u2019s world, marriage needs to invite customers to a banquet. Although the current conditions are insufficient, Mu Yan still hopes Can do as much as possible.\u201cI have already told the customers that the business will be closed tomorrow, and I will accompany you wherever you want to go.\u201d Mu Chen said pamperingly.\u201cAh Chen, you\u2019re so kind, I like you so much.\u201d Mu Yan shyly embraced Mu Chen actively, his little head leaning against him, and his heart was sweet.Ever since he came to this world, he felt that he was so happy and lucky. The wishes that he never dared to dream of before were almost realized after coming here, which made him feel like he was dreaming.Mu Chen hugged Mu Xiaoyan, stroking his hair with his big hands, feeling that he is not the only one who is lucky.\u201cI like you very much too.\u201d Mu Chen said with an affectionate tone.Although I don\u2019t remember the past, but they all say that \u201cthe country is easy to change and the nature is hard to change\u201d, his personality should not have changed much from before, but he always feels that he would not say such nasty love words in his impression. But when facing Mu Yan, these love words always blurted out naturally, from the heart.\u201cAchen, do you know, I used to think about what kind of person I would marry. Maybe he would love me, form a small family with me, have our baby, and we would always live a warm and peaceful life together. However, no one came to my house to propose marriage until I reached the age, I thought these wishes might not come true.\u201d Mu Yan leaned into Mu Chen\u2019s arms and said with emotion.\u201cNo, I will show up.\u201d Mu Chen hugged Mu Yan distressedly, and at the same time felt extremely fortunate that no one came to propose marriage, otherwise what would he do?\u201cWell, I also think Ah God is very kind to me, and let me meet you.\u201d Mu Yan said sweetly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It controls a quarter of the military power of the Federation and occupies a quarter of the land on the central star. The other families are basically attached to the top family below.Because Mr. Jiang is very passionate about history, the entire Jiang family\u2019s ancestral house is built in an antique style with a very historical flavor.At this moment, in the Jiang family mansion, members who are usually busy and invisible are also gathered together, with serious faces. The old man of the Jiang family, Jiang Zhengzhi, is sitting at the head, and the words just said by the four generals of the military he said.\u201cReport to the marshal, the third young master has not been found yet.\u201d The soldier standing in the hall and reporting, resisted his stiff body and weak legs, so as not to lose his composure, cold sweat burst out from behind his back.Several military ministers, who are rarely seen in normal times, actually gathered together. Now he just wants to finish his report and leave here. The aura of each of the officers is not something that a small soldier like him can bear.\u201cYou go down first.\u201d Mr. Jiang also seemed to see his discomfort, and waved his hand to let him leave first.\u201cGrandpa, let me take someone to find the third brother.\u201d Jiang Yuxi said coldlyHe was supposed to be the one to go on this mission, but due to some special circumstances, the third brother Jiang Chenxi took his place to carry out the task. Unexpectedly, he encountered an ambush on the way, and the whereabouts of the third brother were even unknown.Thinking of this, Jiang Yuxi\u2019s eyes shot out a strong coldness and killing intent.\u201cDamn it, who is so bold to ambush my Jiang family\u2019s children.\u201d Jiang Yuanxi said angrily, wishing to chop that person into pieces immediately.\u201cWhere will the third brother be? The Federation is so big.\u201d Jiang Xuexi, the youngest girl of the Jiang family, said worriedly.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much, Ah Chen will be fine, his fate card is still there.\u201d Zheng Xueyan suppressed her worries and comforted her.That\u2019s right, if Jiang Chenxi\u2019s fate card wasn\u2019t still there, everyone would probably think that he had already\u2026The children of the Jiang family will have a fate card that is closely related to their lives since birth. Once something happens, this fate card will be broken, and now that Jiang Chenxi\u2019s life card is still there, it is already the biggest for them. comforted.\u201cSecond Aunt, don\u2019t worry too much, you will definitely find Third Brother.\u201d Jiang Xuexi comforted Zheng Xueyan in turn.\u201cAyu, you send people to continue searching in a larger area, Ahao, continue to track down the mastermind behind this matter, since you dare to attack our Jiang family, you must pay the price of being held accountable by the Jiang family!\u201d Jiang Zhengzhi Said powerfully.Although he is now more than one hundred and forty years old and has entered his twilight years, his majesty has not diminished in the slightest.At the same time, on another planet, Mu Chen and Mu Yan are walking hand in hand on the path in the forest, leisurely as if they are out on a date.Ever since the two confirmed their relationship and got engaged, Mu Chen has devoted himself even more to Mu Yan, taking care of everything. Before, he was worried that his performance would scare the timid Mu Yan. Now that everything is in order, Mu Chen naturally He made no secret of it, holding it in his hand for fear of falling, and holding it in his mouth for fear of melting.Mu Yan\u2019s care and love for Mu Chen is felt in his heart, he feels warm and sweet in his heart, and every day is as happy as a dream.He once fantasized about what his life would be like after marrying a man, but even his greatest fantasies about how good and happy he would be in the future could not compare to what actually happened now.The two of them would go to the forest every day, and the name was to find ingredients, but No. 5, who went together, covered his face with love every time and said: Looking for Nima\u2019s ingredients, every time I am loving Blind people, even if the ingredients are in front of the two of them, they may not be able to see them!No. 5 said that its simple and lovely little host was completely taken away by the big bad wolf, and it was still the kind that has not come back. The most hateful thing is that the only thing in the eyes of the little host is that hateful big gray The wolf, who can\u2019t even see himself, can\u2019t be more frustrated.After following him for two days, No. 5 said that even if he was killed, he would not be a light bulb anymore. Even if one of them couldn\u2019t see it and the other ignored it, it was just because of this that the system was even more frustrated, and he still didn\u2019t want to be a light bulb. I\u2019m going to find Shaomao, anyway, it doesn\u2019t have any hope that they can find the ingredients.Although Mu Yan wants to hold a wedding banquet to thank everyone in the village for their care, but apart from the recipes given by the system, he only knows a few simple home-cooked dishes, and the ingredients he needs don\u2019t need too much.many.Two months passed in the blink of an eye, and it was the day when Mu Chen and Mu Yan got married.On the backward planet, the marriage certificate is still similar to that of the ancestors. You just go to the Civil Affairs Bureau to apply for it, and then each of you gets a red book. The two have already gone to get it when they were discussing about getting married, so now they only need to hold a marriage certificate. Weddings will do.Yang Wenyao\u2019s family is like Mu Yan\u2019s natal family, so Mu Yan lived in Yang\u2019s house the night before he got married, and lived in the room where he lived when he was injured. When he returned to this room again, Mu Yan felt a lot of emotion .At the beginning when he fell off the cliff in a daze and came to another completely strange world, Mu Yan was actually very scared and confused at that time, but the four members of the Yang family treated him very well, so that he could gradually adapt to living in this world. Life in the new world.Later, he got his own house and picked up the current Mu Chen. For Mu Yan, the days when the two of them lived together was as sweet as a stolen one. A handsome man dangled in front of him. Although he tried his best to rely on his identity as a man facing this world, he still couldn\u2019t resist the instinct of his inner brother.But at that time, he only dared to secretly think about Ah Chen, and he didn\u2019t dare to say it out. One was because he was a brother with a thin skin, and on the other hand, he was worried that he would scare Mu Chen away. If he was alone again up.However, he didn\u2019t expect that after only a few months, Ah Chen\u2019s thoughts were the same as his own, and the other party also liked him. There is no news that would make Mu Yan happier than this, even if it came to Now that he owns his own land and house, he doesn\u2019t have the happiness and joy that Mu Chen had!\u201cOkay, I know you are very happy, but now I have to put on light makeup, I\u2019m laughing, and I can\u2019t even put on makeup.\u201d Lin Jiayu joked with a smile.Weddings in the country are actually very simple, but even if it is simple, everyone attaches great importance to it. After all, this is a very important moment in one\u2019s life, and naturally it must be completed in the best and most beautiful state.Mu Yan hurriedly put away the expression on his face, and let Lin Jiayu smear on his face. Thinking of the upcoming wedding, his heart was pounding nervously.\u201cOkay, our words are really beautiful.\u201d Lin Jiayu looked at Mu Yan in the mirror and couldn\u2019t help but praise.Mu Yan has a small face with melon seeds and big watery eyes. The facial features may look ordinary when viewed separately, but when combined together, it makes people feel extremely comfortable.\u201cThis, is this really me?\u201d Mu Yan looked at himself in the mirror, and couldn\u2019t help being stunned.He stretched out his hand and touched his face subconsciously. He never thought that he would have such a side. The makeup technique here is really amazing\u201cOf course, today our Yan Yan is the most handsome groom.\u201d \u201cThe most handsome is Chen.\u201d Mu Yan lowered his head and said shyly, his little face with light make-up was blushing, very attractive.\u201cThat speech is the most beautiful.\u201d Lin Jiayu said very kindly.Seeing Mu Yan and Mu Chen getting married, she was actually very happy in her heart.Mu Chen still stayed at his and Mu Yan\u2019s house, and he was going to go to Yang\u2019s house from here to bring his little lover back for the wedding.Because neither Mu Chen nor Mu Yan had other relatives, Lin Jiayu was in charge of Mu Yan\u2019s side, while Yang Wenyao was in charge of Mu Chen\u2019s side.The time was almost up, and Mu Chen and Yang Wenyao set off to welcome the day of Mu. The Taohua Village was very lively, almost full of people coming and going, even more lively than going to a temple fair.Everyone heard that Mu Yan and Mu Chen were getting married, and they all came out to congratulate and join in the fun. Even many people from other villages dragged their families to Taohua Village after hearing the news. Some of them were customers who had bought Muyan\u2019s scallion pancakes and steamed buns before, and some came here just because of the reputation.The distance between Mu\u2019s house and Yang\u2019s house is not that long. From the moment Mu Chen went out, he saw people standing on the streets on both sides. Those who knew or didn\u2019t know all greeted Mu Chen with a smile, but now Mu Chen wanted to hurry up. Point to bring his little lover back, so he just nodded at those people perfunctorily, but the pace under his feet became faster and faster.Seeing this, everyone smiled kindly and made way for him to go to Yang\u2019s house.\u201cAunt Lin, I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d Mu Yan felt more and more nervous.Obviously he and Ah Chen have lived together for several months, and after that, it was just that Ah Chen\u2019s place was changed to his own room, and nothing else changed, but Mu Yan just felt that he was nervous, especially when he thought of Tonight\u2019s\u2026 He was even more nervous.\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, everyone will have this moment.\u201d Lin Jiayu comforted Mu Yan gently, helping him relieve some tension.\u201cAunt Lin, Uncle Yang and Mu Chen have already arrived at the door.\u201d A little girl came in bouncingly and said.The nervousness that was finally calmed down by Lin Jiayu suddenly came up again. Mu Yan felt that his legs were trembling with tension, and he couldn\u2019t take a step at all. What if he made a fool of himself later?\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay, don\u2019t be nervous, just think about it as usual.\u201d Seeing Mu Yan\u2019s appearance, Lin Jiayu felt a little helpless, and could only try to comfort him.The wedding process in the countryside is very simple, and there are no fancy customs such as \u201ccalling the door\u201d. It only needs the groom to pick up the bride from the bride\u2019s natal home and complete the oath with the blessing of the villagers.\u201cXiaoyu, here we come.\u201d Yang Wenyao\u2019s voice came from outside, and he heard his voice before seeing him.Lin Jiayu opened the door, and Yang Wenyao and Mu Chen were standing in the yard, followed by a group of villagers and children who came to join in the fun.\u201cChen, come in.\u201d Lin Jiayu said to Mu Chen, then made way for him, and when Mu Chen passed by, carefully reminded him in a low voice: \u201cYanyan is a little nervous.\u201dMu Chen nodded towards Lin Jiayu, thanking: \u201cThank you, Aunt Lin.Watching Mu Chen go in, Lin Jiayu smiled and closed the door, leaving the couple some time to be alone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although he can bump into deer, he doesn\u2019t even dare to look at it. It must be because today is their wedding. After today, they will be a family. He is the closest person in the world.\u201cI can\u2019t wait to complete the wedding quickly, so that you will be completely mine alone.\u201d Mu Chen stepped forward, gently hugged Mu Yan into his arms, and said affectionately.Mu Yan became even more shy, and buried himself in Mu Chen\u2019s arms, not daring tolook up.\u201cLet\u2019s go out quickly, get the wedding done early, you\u2019re mineup. \u201c\u201cAh Chen, I, my legs are weak, and I can\u2019t walk anymore.\u201d Mu Yan was so anxious that he was about to cry, he tried hard to lift his feet, but because he was too nervous and sweet, his body couldn\u2019t be controlled at all.Mu Chen put one hand on Mu Yan\u2019s waist, and the other hand passed through the bend of his leg, and suddenly hugged him horizontally.\u201cIn this way, you don\u2019t need to walk by yourself.\u201d Mu Chen said, and walked out of the room directly. When the people outside saw the couple coming out, they booed immediately, and it was very lively.In fact, when the groom picks up the bride, he rides with the bride to the groom\u2019s house, and then the groom carries the bride in at the door of the groom\u2019s house. In the form of hugging, Mu Yan was directly carried from the Yang family into the Mu family.And the onlookers along the way also booed from beginning to end, happily following the couple towards Mu\u2019s house.The open space in front of Mu\u2019s house has been decorated, and many villagers have already been waiting there. After seeing the newcomers, they even pulled flowers to celebrate.With a smile on Mu Chen\u2019s face, he walked towards the oath stage step by step with Mu Yan who was still pretending to be an ostrich.Because both Mu Yan and Mu Chen are men, they did not choose a wedding dress, but a suit for the wedding dress.Mu Chen was wearing a black and elegant suit, which set off his perfect figure without a doubt, attracting all the women present, whether they were unmarried or married, their faces were flushed, and they looked at him quietly.Mu Yan was wearing a white suit of the same style as Mu Chen\u2019s. The suit was slightly cinched at the waist, outlining Mu Yan\u2019s slender waist, and with a firm grip, it made the whole person look more petite, lovable, and more lovable. tempting.One black and one white, one tall and one petite, they look like a perfect matchToday\u2019s officiant is the head of Taohua Village. The head of the village stood in front of the swearing-in platform with a kind smile on his face, and officiated the marriage for the two couples.\u201cMr. Mu Yan, are you willing to marry Mr. Mu Chen? Whether in good times or bad times, rich or poor, healthy or sick, young or old, you will accompany him through thick and thin, share weal and woe, and become a lifelong partner !\u201d\u201cI am willing.\u201d Although Mu Yan replied in a small voice, he was extremely firm.\u201cMr. Mu Chen, are you willing to marry Mr. Mu Yan? Whether in good times or bad, rich or poor, healthy or sick, young or old, you will accompany him through thick and thin, share weal and woe, and become a lifelong partner! \u201c\u201cI, Mu Chen, hereby swear to everyone that I will love him, love him, pamper him, and protect Mu Mu for the rest of my life. If I break my promise, I will be struck by thunder!\u201d Mu Chen said firmly to everyone present, Make your own promise to Mu Yan.Those firm eyes and serious attitude deeply shocked all the onlookers present, especially the women, who envied Mu Yan one after another, and the onlookers also sent their blessings one after another. Only one pair of eyes , with strong jealousy and resentment from beginning to end, but no one paid attention to her.This is the end of the wedding process, and the next step is the wedding banquet.Because Mu Yan moved into Lin Jiayu\u2019s house one day in advance, everything at the wedding banquet was prepared by Mu Chen.When Mu Yan saw the dishes being brought out, the scallion pancakes, and the steamed buns, his eyes widened in surprise.\u201cAh Chen, so you can cook.\u201d Mu Yan said in surprise, looking at Mu Chen full of admiration.\u201cI saw you do it before.\u201d Mu Chen rubbed his soft hair and said dotingly.\u201cThat\u2019s even more powerful.\u201d Hearing this, Mu Yan admired him even more. He had cooked food for nearly ten years in his previous life, and it was only at this ordinary level that he is now. To be able to do this is simply a genius.Mu Chen enjoyed his little lover\u2019s admiration for him very much, and thought in his heart that he would cook more for his little lover in the future, so as not to let him get tired because of it.Leaving Mu Yan\u2019s surprise aside, all the villagers who came to the wedding banquet widened their eyes and stared in bewilderment when they saw the dishes exuding a strong fragrance.\u201cWhat are these? They smell so good.\u201d\u201cWhat is this for? Is it served for us to appreciate? \u201c\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve smelled something so fragrant, what should I do if I suddenly feel hungry?\u201dThe guests were chattering about the dishes, all of them looked puzzled. So, at this time, those customers who had bought scallion pancakes and steamed buns were immediately proud.\u201cThese are all for eating, okay? They must be made by the little boss. You don\u2019t know that the little boss\u2019s cooking skills are really good. Anyone who has eaten it can\u2019t wait to eat it.\u201dVillagers who have never seen Mu Yan\u2019s cooking skills looked at the speaker with a look of \u201cI don\u2019t read much, don\u2019t lie to me\u201d, obviously not believing it.The person who spoke suddenly felt that he was much taller than the others. Although they had never eaten any of these dishes, they had eaten other dishes before, which was considered knowledgeable, and they were definitely not the same as these bumpkins.\u201cThank you very much for coming to my wedding with Mu Mu. These small dishes are just a little thought from Mu Chen. I hope you don\u2019t dislike them.\u201d Mu Chen said to the guests below.Yang Wenyao\u2019s family helped arrange for those guests to sit down and enjoy these meals. Although there were not many per table, it was enough for those who had never eaten these things.Many people were a bit afraid at first, but when they saw those who had bought scallion pancakes and steamed stuffed buns scrambling to eat them like crazy, and enjoying themselves, they couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, and couldn\u2019t help but taste it. , the result is out of control.The whole wedding scene suddenly looked like a scene of kindergarten children\u2019s lunch fight, fighting each other, choking each other, gobbling up, eating with great joy, I am afraid that at this time, everyone has already left the new couple behind.Mu Chen also took the opportunity to take Mu Yan back to their home, leaving only Yang Wenyao and others outside to entertain customers who don\u2019t care about their image.During the two months of preparations for the wedding, their home was naturally redecorated, and all the necessary furniture was complete, and most of them were built by Mu Chen\u2019s novice.Although Mu Yan used to be happy and satisfied with owning his own house, he didn\u2019t have a strong sense of belonging. Therefore, even if there was little furniture in the house, he didn\u2019t think he wanted a home that much, so he felt nothing.However, at this moment, his sense of belonging to this family has reached an unprecedented level. This will be the place where he and Ah Chen will live in the future, and it will belong to their home. They will live here forever in the future, and there will be more Belongs to their lovely baby.Thinking of the baby, Mu Yan suddenly felt shy again, because he thought of the wedding night tonight, he was very nervous, but also had a trace of anticipation.He and Chen are married, and they will have a baby soon.Mu Chen sat on the edge of the bed, pulled the man onto his lap, hugged him into his arms, kept his eyes on Mu Yan, did nothing, just stared at Mu Yan, what do you think? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough.Mu Yan was very embarrassed by the other party\u2019s gaze, his little head lowered again and again, wishing to hide it in his chest.\u201cWhy do you have to lower your head for such a beautiful face, let me take a good look.\u201d Mu Chen\u2019s voice was strangely bewildering, and he lifted the other\u2019s chin with his big hand, so that the whole red face was reflected in his own eyes. in the pupil.\u201cAh Chen\u2026\u201d Mu Yan\u2019s voice was soft and waxy, like a feather, and the coquettish Mu Chen\u2019s heart was itchy, and he wished that he would be executed right now on the spot.It\u2019s a pity that Mumu is still too young, he has to wait, wait, wait until Mumu grows up, and then let him completely belong to him from body to heart.\u201cA Chen?\u201d Mu Yan tilted his head and looked at Mu Chen, with a trace of doubt in his tone, he didn\u2019t understand why A Chen didn\u2019t respond when he looked at himMu Chen hugged him tightly, wishing he could directly rub him into his body.Putting his head close to the opponent\u2019s neck, he greedily sucked in the breath that belonged to the opponent, \u201cMumu, I can\u2019t bear it anymore.\u201dAlthough he told himself over and over again in his heart to wait for Mumu to grow up and want him, but every time he faced Mumu, he was like a fledgling boy, all his self-control quickly faded away, leaving only the last The rawest and most authentic response.\u201cIf you can\u2019t bear it, don\u2019t bear it. It\u2019s not good for your health.\u201d Although Mu Yan didn\u2019t know what Mu Chen was referring to, he didn\u2019t want to see Ah Chen become sad because of patience. No matter what Ah Chen wanted, He is willing to give it to him.Mu Chen took a deep breath and tried hard to calm himself down. His rationality, which was already on the verge of collapse, almost completely collapsed because of Mu Yan\u2019s words.\u201cMumu, can you help me?\u201d Mu Chen said hoarsely, with an unspeakable charm.\u201cOkay,\u201d Mu Yan replied without any thought, and then he was a little at a loss, \u201cI, how can I help?\u201dMu Chen took Mu Yan\u2019s hand and stretched it below his abdomen, feeling the fiery touch, Mu Yan was startled suddenly, his whole face was so red that it was about to explode.Even if he has never experienced it, but when he is sixteen years old, he will know what he should know. After all, with them, everyone at his age should marry and have a baby.Now Mu Yan\u2019s mind is full of \u201cWe are going to have a bridal chamber\u201d and \u201cWe are going to have a bridal chamber\u201d.After that, Mu Yan was moved by Mu Chen, his mind was in chaos, except for the word \u201cbridal chamber\u201d, he couldn\u2019t think about anything else at all, especially when his part was also held by the other party, his head became even more confusing. Like a mess of paste, even the bridal chamber can\u2019t think about it, and the whole person is at the mercy of Mu Chen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Some interest is still possible.Mu Yan, who experienced this kind of thing for the first time, couldn\u2019t react at all. The joy of his body made him follow Mu Chen ups and downs in the sea of desire. Feeling overwhelmed and fainted.Mu Chen carefully put Mu Yan on the bed, carefully tucked in the quilt for him, and after he pressed a kiss on the forehead, he thought about going out to entertain guests.Although the country is not too particular, and Yang Wenyao is there to help entertain, but as one of the grooms, he can\u2019t stay out all the time.Mu Yan didn\u2019t wake up until night fell and the lights came on. After the initial period of confusion, he suddenly thought of what he did with Mu Chen before going to bed, and he wanted to hide under the quilt and not come out.It turns out\u2026 It turns out that doing that kind of thing with someone you like is such a feeling, it\u2019s very comfortable, and it\u2019s also very embarrassing.I don\u2019t know \u201c: Will there be a baby in the house?\u201d Mu Yan touched his belly with a happy face, as if there was already a baby in it, imagining how cute his baby would be after it was born.Although Mu Yan knew a little about that kind of thing, but because his father was unreliable, he didn\u2019t tell him the needs in detail, so Mu Yan decided that he and Ah Chen had already had a bridal chamber wedding night, baby Or it might already be in his stomach.When Mu Chen returned to the room, what he saw was Mu Yan who was rubbing his belly and smiling happily.\u201cIs the body still uncomfortable?\u201d Mu Chen stepped forward and hugged the man and the quilt into his arms, asking warmly.Although he didn\u2019t make it to the end, the intensity still made Mu Mu faint, so Mu Chen was worried that Mu Yan\u2019s body would feel uncomfortable.Mu Yan shook his head lightly, indicating that he was not uncomfortable, and then asked with a soft voice, with a hint of expectation: \u201cAchen, do you think I will have a baby in my stomach? What do you like?\u201d What kind of baby?\u201dHearing Mu Yan\u2019s question, Mu Chen was stunned for a moment, then returned to normal, put his big hand on Mu Yan\u2019s belly, rubbed it gently for him, and said: \u201cAs long as it is our baby, I will care for any kind of baby.\u201d like.\u201dLet\u2019s not talk about whether they made it to the end, even if Mu Yan is a boy, the baby will not come out of Mu Yan\u2019s belly. After all, even if the technology of StarCraft has advanced a lot, it has not yet reached the point where men can have childrenBut he heard from Uncle Yang that on other planets with more advanced technology, men and women can have children when they get married, and they can go to the hospital to train them. If Mumu likes children very much, he can take Mumu to raise one. Chen began to think about this problem.However, Mu Yan, who was immersed in the baby\u2019s fantasies, didn\u2019t notice what Mu Chen was thinking, maybe even if he saw it, he wouldn\u2019t be able to see it.\u201cLet\u2019s eat something first, you\u2019ve slept all day.\u201d Mu Chen picked up the noodle soup he just brought in, and planned to feed Mu Yan himself.Because there is no staple food such as rice, it is impossible to make porridge, but Mu Chen made the gnocchi very small without a teacher, and cooked a thick pot of gnocchi soup, which looks like thick rice porridge generally.Mu Chen scooped up a spoonful, blew it gently, then tested the temperature with his lips, and then sent it to Mu Yan\u2019s mouth, as if he was feeding a child who couldn\u2019t eat by himself.Mu Yan\u2019s face was always red from the beginning to the end, shyly wanting to shrink back into the quilt, but he was reluctant to get along with Mu Chen like this, so while struggling like this, he instinctively opened his mouth to eat what Mu Chen handed to his lips. Pimple porridge, you can eat a big bowl of it without knowing it.\u201cLie down first, I\u2019ll come over after cleaning up.\u201d Mu Chen put Mu Yan down, then tucked in the quilt, kissed his face again, and then walked out of the room with the bowl in his hand.Mu Yan touched the place where he had just been kissed with his small hand, and the little one was curled up and rolling under the quilt. If he lifted the quilt at this moment, he would find that his increasingly white body was also slightly reddened.That night, Mu Chen and Mu Yan, who were sleeping in each other\u2019s arms, had a happy and sweet look on their faces, even their dreams were sweet.The next day, both of them rarely stayed in bed, and didn\u2019t get up until the sun rose.Lin Jiayu was a little worried about these two people, especially worried that Mu Chen would hurt Mu Yan because he didn\u2019t know something about it. He wanted to find a chance to talk to Mu Chen yesterday, but who would have thought that these two people were so stupid? Urgently, she actually slipped away after taking the oath. She was too embarrassed to go to the new house to find the two of them. She was worried about what she was seeing, so she held back until the next day.When it was almost noon, Lin Jiayu finally couldn\u2019t bear it anymore, and asked Yang Yinghao to invite Mu Yan and Mu Chen to their house for lunch, and then took the opportunity to call Mu Yan into the room alone.\u201cAunt Lin, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Mu Yan was a little uncomfortable being looked at by Lin Jiayu, and finally couldn\u2019t help asking.From the moment Mu Yan came in, Lin Jiayu observed Mu Yan carefully, especially in some places that couldn\u2019t be covered by clothes. She couldn\u2019t help but blush when she saw the traces exposed outside. It can be seen that the relationship between the two of them yesterday fierce.Although Lin Jiayu has always regarded Mu Yan as a child, she is actually not much older than Mu Yan, and she is a woman. It is always embarrassing to say these things to boys, but when she thinks that the other party has a relative here None, and no one will tell them this. If they get hurt because they don\u2019t understand, wouldn\u2019t it be very bad, and maybe it will affect their relationship.So, after Lin Jiayu repeatedly gave herself psychological hints, she finally spoke up and asked, \u201cYesterday\u2026did you have a wedding ceremony yesterday?\u201dHearing this, Mu Yan\u2019s face suddenly became hot, and he was so shy that he wished he could find a hole in the ground and hide in it.When Lin Jiayu saw Mu Yan\u2019s appearance, his previous shyness was immediately forgotten, and he was still free to tease him, \u201cWhat can\u2019t you say to me, I am your elder, if you have any questions, you can Come and find me, and I will definitely make the decision for you.\u201dMu Yan is grateful to Lin Jiayu. Since he came into this world, if there is no Lin Jiayu, maybe he doesn\u2019t know what the situation is now, so he is actually close and dependent on Lin Jiayu\u2019s family in his heart.\u201cYeah.\u201d Mu Yan replied in a low voice with a red face.\u201cLooking at your appearance, you should be a bridal chamber, then did he hurt you? I heard that the recipient is always easy to get hurt for the first time.\u201d Lin Jiayu said worriedly.\u201cNo, no, I, I\u2019m fine, Ah Chen didn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d Although shy, Mu Yan suppressed his embarrassment and said.Lin Jiayu was a little surprised, because she had checked a lot of information about Mu Chen and Mu Yan\u2019s marriage in the past two months. When she got up, she felt strange.\u201cTell me in detail.\u201d Lin Jiayu was worried, and asked Mu Yan to describe the process of the bridal chamber to her in detail, and she couldn\u2019t laugh or cry.After working on it for a long time, the two of them didn\u2019t make it to the end, no wonder Yan Yan was still alive and kicking today.Afterwards, Lin Jiayu introduced this aspect to Mu Yan in detail. She was not embarrassed by any of the girls. For the baby, you have to put Ah Chen\u2019s one in your place, so that you can have a baby.Mu Yan rubbed his belly, secretly decided that he must get pregnant with a baby soon, he wanted to give Ah Chen a cute babyOn the way back, Mu Chen found that Mu Yan would sneak a glance at himself from time to time, and the foothold of his gaze was always in an indescribable place. After the sneak glance, he immediately retracted his gaze, and then he blushed alone. Looking at Mu Chen\u2019s face, his heart itched unbearably.Sigh\u2026 I really don\u2019t know if I am torturing myself by getting married now. My partner is too young to see him every day and can\u2019t eat. It is simply the biggest test for him!No, you have to charge some interest when you go back.So, both of them rushed home with their own little thoughts.The dinner is still cooked by Mu Chen. Ever since Mu Chen learned a lot from watching Mu Yan cook, he fell in love with the feeling of cooking for his lover, especially when he saw his lover eating to his heart\u2019s content, even if he didn\u2019t eat Also feel very satisfied.As the saying goes, \u201cThink about **** when you are full and warm\u201d, after feeding your stomach, the most primitive desires of human beings start to move around, and Mu Chen\u2019s eyes when looking at Mu Yan become much hotter, Mu Yan often looks I can\u2019t wait to shrink myself into a small ball.In fact, Mu Yan was also looking forward to that, especially after chatting with Aunt Lin, he knew more, and couldn\u2019t wait to make a baby with Ah Chen.\u201cMu Mu\u2026\u201d Mu Chen called Mu Yan\u2019s nickname in a low voice, his fiery lips kept falling on his forehead, the tip of his nose, and his cheeks, and finally found his lips accurately, and entangled with each other to dance together.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Mu Yan felt a small flame burning in his body, and his body became very hot and sensitive. Every time he was kissed, a small electric current would flow, causing waves of numbness and trembling.\u201cMumu, I love you.\u201d Mu Chen whispered his loveIf it was in the past, he would definitely not feel that these words would come out of his mouth, but when facing Mu Yan, these words seemed to be instinctive, and he could always say them naturally, without going through the brain at all. think.\u201cI, I also\u2026en\u2026love you\u2026\u201d Mu Yan responded, trying hard to stay awake, because he still wanted to make a baby\u201cAh, Ah Chen, I\u2026I want to\u2026\u201d Mu Yan was so teased by Mu Chen that he couldn\u2019t even speak clearly, and he couldn\u2019t finish a sentence intermittently.When Mu Chen heard Mu Yan\u2019s initiative to court, he was stunned for a moment, and then he almost couldn\u2019t control himself and confessed directly, so he took a deep breath and calmed himself down, otherwise he would be ashamed.\u201cIt\u2019s really annoying.\u201d Mu Chen gritted his teeth and said, then leaned over and blocked the little mouth that made him want to stop, preventing him from saying anything surprising, and let him directly explain it.Mu Yan\u2019s head became more and more confused, he really wanted to explain the phrase \u201cI want a baby\u201d to Mu Chen clearly, but every time he said the first two words, he would either welcome a hot kiss or burst into tears. Another burst of excruciating pleasure gave him no chance to fully speak.If Mu Yan knew that all of this was caused by the first two words, I wonder if he would be dumbfounded.Thus, Mu Yan\u2019s baby-making plan failed for the first time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What mistake did God make, or\u2026too much trouble?Although they didn\u2019t make it to the end, they have been making out almost every day for the past few days, and sometimes Mu Yan fainted because the feeling was too strong. Mu Chen deeply reflected on himself, and decided to You must control it, and you must not make your little lover dissatisfied anymore, otherwise the interest may be withdrawn in the future.So, that night, Mu Chen refrained himself from touching his little lover, but he didn\u2019t expect to attract Mu Yan\u2019s more resentful eyes and several entangled little expressions that hesitated to speak.\u201cMu Mu, what\u2019s the matter? Tell me what\u2019s wrong, don\u2019t hold it in your heart alone, if I made a mistake, I will definitely change it.\u201d Mu Chen gently hugged Mu Yan, and decided to take the initiative to ask. What separates people.Mu Yan looked at Mu Chen\u2019s handsome face, and thought about what he wanted to say, he was so ashamed that he couldn\u2019t help lowering his head, not daring to look at Mu Chen.He really wanted to tell Ah Chen those words, but felt too shy, and swallowed them involuntarily every time they reached his mouth, unable to say anything.\u201cMu Mu, we are already husband and wife, there is nothing we can\u2019t say.\u201d Mu Chen encouraged Mu Yan to speak his mind.Mu Yan thought that the relationship between them had changed and became closer, and that matter was related to their future happiness, so he had to say it no matter what.\u201cAh Chen, Aunt Lin said that if she wants to have a baby, she will put your little brother here.\u201d Mu Yan blushed, and took Mu Chen\u2019s hand and stretched it behind him, his whole body was about to be steamed.Mu Chen felt a \u201cboom\u201d explode in his head, which made him a little dazed.\u201cMumu, you\u2026 what did you say?\u201d Mu Chen swallowed secretly, trying hard to keep himself rational, and not let himself lose control and hurt the person he loves the most.\u201cI\u2026I want to have a baby with you.\u201d Mu Yan didn\u2019t dare to look directly at Mu Chen, and said weakly.\u201cPa\u201d the string of reason in his brain was completely broken in Mu Yan\u2019s words, it was broken very thoroughly, coupled with Mu Chen\u2019s dissatisfaction with desires these days, he simply wished he could turn over now Pressing the person under him, he took possession of him fiercely, directly ignoring Mu Yan\u2019s words \u201chave a baby\u201d.\u201cMu, Mumu, you are still young, wait until you grow up.\u201d Mu Chen tried hard to control himself, pinching his thigh with his hand, in order to keep himself calm.And he really wanted to get out of bed and take a shower, and use cold water to calm himself down, but his body seemed to be stuck to the bed, unable to move at all, but there was a person beside him who kept bewitching him, it was really terrible.\u201cI\u2019m not young anymore. I\u2019m so old that I can have a baby.\u201d Mu Yan decided to be brave for the cute baby, and then took the initiative to hug Mu Chen, and pouted his mouth and kissed him for the first time.The jerky and disorganized kiss was like a powerful aphrodisiac, which made Mu Chen completely surrender, turning back to the guest, and kissed the little mouth that made him suffer so much.Having completely possessed his lover, Mu Chen, who finally didn\u2019t need to use cold water or work with his right hand, couldn\u2019t help asking Mu Yan over and over again, and Mu Yan cooperated very obediently, making their bodies more fit.Until the moment when he was made to pass out, Mu Yan still had a happy smile on his mouth, and finally\u2026 could have their own babyAfterwards, Mu Chen looked at the smile on the corner of Mu Yan\u2019s mouth who had passed out, and his heart was filled with a sweet, never-before-seen sense of happiness that crazily grew in his heart.At this moment, the previous memories and all the previous things are not important anymore, in his heart and in his mind, there is only this cute and cute Mu Mu in his arms.Mu Chen pressed a kiss on Mu Yan\u2019s forehead with distress, went to the bathroom and filled the pool with warm water, then carefully picked up Mu Yan, and helped him clean his body carefully and patiently.During this period, Mu Yan\u2019s sensitive body hummed subconsciously because of Mu Chen\u2019s touch, and kept burrowing into Mu Chen\u2019s arms, as if he wanted to avoid the big hand that made him tremble.\u201cWell\u2026 no more\u2026\u201d Mu Yan closed his eyes tightly, begging for mercy habitually, that cute little appearance made Mu Chen feel guilty and distressed, but couldn\u2019t help but want to do it again.Of course, it is impossible for Mu Chen to come here again, Mu Mu must not be able to bear it, if he really hurt Mu Mu, he will never forgive himselfPut the cleaned wooden words on the bed that has been made up, hugging each other is like owning the whole world, with happy smiles on the corners of their mouths, and they fell into a sweeter dreamland together.\u201cHmm\u2026 a soft reminder, signaling that the sleeping person on the bed is about to wake up.The sun was already hanging high on the branches, and the warm sunlight shone on the big fluffy and soft bed. A small head was huddled under the quilt. At this moment, the owner of the head was sleepy, half asleep and half awake.Uh\u2026it hurts so much, Mu Yan felt as if his body was being run over, sore and sore, he didn\u2019t even dare to move.Mu Yan stayed awake for a long time, in a daze for a long time, and finally remembered what happened yesterday, his delicate face turned red, and he kept shrinking into the quilt, trying to cover his whole body.Yesterday, he and Ah Chen had a bridal chamber\u2026Yesterday, Chen and him were like this, that, that\u2026yesterday\u2026When Mu Yan thought of the madness last night, his little face became even more red. If he lifted the quilt at this moment, he would find that his naked body was covered with a layer of red, and he became more attractive.Yesterday, they finally did it according to Aunt Lin\u2019s method, so\u2026 Does that mean he already has a baby in his stomach?Mu Yan\u2019s small hands gently caressed the little belly, it was still flat, but who knew if a little life would be conceived already?If\u2026if there is a baby, it will definitely look like him and Ah Chen.When Mu Chen walked in with a bowl of hot soup, what he saw was Mu Yan with a happy face imagining the baby.\u201cAre you awake? Get up and drink some hot soup.\u201d Mu Chen\u2019s voice has a unique tone, which can almost make the ears pregnant, not to mention that his tone is very, very gentle and sticky at the moment Nostalgia, the lethality is even higher.When Mu Yan heard Mu Chen\u2019s voice, he immediately shrank his little head under the quilt, leaving only a bunch of black soft hair outside.Mu Chen put the hot soup on the table beside the bed, then sat on the edge of the bed, looking at someone who was curled up in the quilt with a smile.\u201cCome out, don\u2019t get bored.\u201d Mu Chen said with a indulgent smile, gently patting Mu Yan with his big hand across the quilt, coaxing him.Mu Yan felt that his face was so hot that he was going to get angry, and his body was also very hot. If it wasn\u2019t for the pain, he might have to hide even deeper.\u201cI made your favorite pimple soup, it will be cold if it doesn\u2019t come out.\u201d Mu Chen said with infinite doting as if he was coaxing a child.\u201cI, I\u2019m not hungry\u2026\u201d Mu Yan\u2019s soft voice came from under the quilt, adding to the feeling of boredom.\u201cMumu, it was my fault yesterday. I shouldn\u2019t have done it so many times. I will definitely restrain myself next time\u2026well\u2026\u201d Mu Chen looked at the little hand covering his mouth with a smile in his eyes, as well as the almost familiar hand. see through face\u201cYou\u2026don\u2019t say it\u2026\u201d Mu Yan shyly dared not look at Mu Chen, and whispered.Mu Chen licked that soft little hand, and sure enough, he heard the other party\u2019s surprised \u201cah\u201d, and quickly took it back.\u201cWeren\u2019t you very enthusiastic yesterday? You took the initiative\u2026\u201d Mu Chen smiled, deliberately teasing Mu Yan, and said something embarrassing.Hearing this, Mu Yan remembered what happened last night, which made him dare not face Mu Chen anymore. He finally crawled out of the bed and shrank back in again. This time, he didn\u2019t even leave his hair for Mu Chen.Seeing this, Mu Chen didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry, and he didn\u2019t dare to tease him anymore, his little lover was too easily shy.\u201cOkay, stop teasing you, hurry up and eat something, or your stomach will feel uncomfortable again.\u201d Mu Chen hastily coaxed the little lover softly.\u201cYou\u2026don\u2019t talk anymore\u2026\u201d Mu Yan\u2019s voice came from under the blanket.\u201cOkay, okay, I won\u2019t say anything, I definitely won\u2019t.\u201d Mu Chen compromised unconditionally, with a deep smile and pampering in his voice.Only then did Mu Yan tentatively stick out his little head from under the quilt, and then he heard his stomach protest with a \u201cgurgling\u201d.Mu Chen immediately brought over the pimple soup, then walked around Mu Yan with his other big hand, wrapped him and the quilt tightly in his arms, scooped up a spoonful, and wanted to feed Mu Yan himself.Mu Yan is both shy and sweet. Although this is not the first time he has been intimate with Ah Chen, since the actual physical contact, the relationship between the two has sublimated, becoming more intimate and harmonious. Like minded.After Mu Yan had his meal, Mu Chen took the initiative to give him a massage, which relieved the soreness on his body and made him feel much more comfortable.But Mu Chen didn\u2019t allow Mu Yan to get out of bed, after all, it\u2019s Mu Yan\u2019s first time to have sex, and it\u2019s still a man\u2019s body, so it must be a lot of hard work.So on this day, Mu Chen took care of Mu Yan without any details, wishing he could even go to the toilet for him.After lying in bed for a day, Mu Yan felt much better the next day.In fact, Mu Yan is not as fragile as Mu Chen imagined. After all, as a brother, Mu Yan\u2019s body is somewhat different from that of men in this world, especially when it comes to Cheng Huan. Gifted.However, Mu Yan also enjoyed Mu Chen\u2019s thoughtfulness very much, so he didn\u2019t take away the other party\u2019s kindness.Here, Mu Chen and Mu Yan\u2019s newlyweds are deeply affectionate, but the countless villagers over there can\u2019t wait any longer, and their resentment is soaring.\u201cWhen will the little boss be able to open the stall again?

I almost vomited from eating the nutrition powder these days, and I realized that the nutrition powder is really nasty and too bad to eat. Why didn\u2019t I notice it before?\u201d\u201cMe too. I have been trying to eat it these days. The taste is really amazing.\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019ve been eating shi-like things for decades, and I still treat that as delicious. I can\u2019t see myself so stupid.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The villagers were attacking nutrition powder one after another, as if they wished they would never touch nutrition powder again. If they knew that the raw materials of their favorite scallion pancakes and steamed buns were nutrition powder, what kind of expressions would they have? Wonderful.\u201cHow about, let\u2019s go to the little boss\u2019s house and ask?\u201d Someone asked.Discuss.\u201cThis is not good. After all, the little boss and the big boss just got married. It\u2019s the honeymoon period. We have to wait until the honeymoon is over.\u201d Another person hesitated.\u201cIt\u2019s been a few days since I got married, and my honeymoon should be over. If I wait like this, I think I\u2019m going to lose a few pounds.\u201d\u201cMy son clamors for steamed stuffed buns every day. You say that the little boss doesn\u2019t leave the stall. Where can I buy them for him? The hair I\u2019m annoyed by him every day is about to fall out.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go, the little boss is so kind, he definitely can\u2019t bear to let everyone be so depressed.\u201d Someone continued to confuse everyone.In fact, if there is only the little boss alone, it\u2019s okay for them to go by themselves, but the key point is that the little boss also has a big boss. Compared with the easy-talking and kind little boss, this big boss is a bit frightening.Thinking of Mu Chen who is always slumped and expressionless, everyone has the urge to shrink back, so they encourage everyone to go together for the sake of their own appetites, as well as for the sake of their family and children.There are many people and strength, even if it is a big boss, it should\u2026 maybe\u2026 maybe\u2026 it won\u2019t reject them\u2026 right?Facts showed that no matter how many people came, Mu Chen would refuse without mercy when it was time for him to refuse, and he would not be moved even though these people talked nonsense.In Mu Chen\u2019s heart, only Mu Yan is the most important thing, once the stall starts, it means that Mu Yan will get up early every day to be busy again.Why does Mumu of his family have to work so hard every day for these people who don\u2019t want to do it.\u201cBoss, look at so many people who have lost a lot of weight. It\u2019s really hard to eat nutritional powder. If there are no steamed buns and scallion pancakes, everyone may starve to death.\u201d Someone was ready to impress Mu Chen with emotion.It\u2019s a pity that Mu Chen didn\u2019t even bother to give him a look, no matter how these people persuaded him, he couldn\u2019t stand still like a mountain.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Mu Yan heard the commotion outside in the bedroom, so he couldn\u2019t help but take a look. Then he saw a group of villagers surrounding his house, and Mu Chen was blocking the door. He suddenly became nervous and hurried forward to ask .When the villagers saw Mu Yan coming out, their eyes sparkled, and someone immediately yelled: \u201cLittle boss, we all want to come here to buy buns. You, the buns you made are so, so delicious. What, when will you buy them?\u201d Can you still do it?\u201dWhen the man spoke, Mu Chen\u2019s cold and sharp gaze locked onto the man tightly, making the man shiver with cold, but for the sake of future happiness, he still tried his best to resist Mu Chen\u2019s killing With a straight gaze, he said everything he wanted to say.Although it was only a short sentence, it seemed as if he had exhausted all his strength, and suddenly he fell down on the person behind him in a discouraged manner.If there were not many people blocking the front, if he didn\u2019t want Mu Mu to see the violent scene, Mu Chen would have driven these villagers away long ago.Mu Yan obviously didn\u2019t think that the villagers at the door came to their house for this reason, so he couldn\u2019t react for a while.The other villagers wanted to follow the example of the previous one, but before they could open their mouths, they were interrupted by Mu Chen\u2019s icy gaze, and then Mu Chen pushed everyone out mercilessly, and slammed the door open. The gate was closed, blocking the sight of those villagers and Mu Yan.\u201cAh, Ah Chen, are you angry?\u201d Seeing Mu Chen\u2019s unhappy look, Mu Yan asked cautiously.\u201cNo.\u201d Mu Chen hurriedly restrained the expression on his face, put on Mu Yan\u2019s most familiar gentle smile, hugged Mu Yan and walked into the house.Seeing that Mu Chen was not angry, Mu Yan breathed a sigh of relief, and then began to seriously think about what those villagers said.He will definitely continue selling buns. After all, the upgrade task has not been completed yet, but just now, looking at Ah Chen\u2019s appearance, it seems that he doesn\u2019t want to continue selling buns. Is it because he is too tired?Mu Yan remembered that some time ago, when they were selling steamed buns, Ah Chen got up earlier than him every day, and when he got up, Ah Chen had already made nearly half of the buns, so Ah Chen would definitely be very tired.\u201cAh Chen, I will make buns in the future, and you will only be responsible for selling them, okay?\u201d Mu Yan said suddenly, so that Ah Chen would not be too tired.When Mu Chen heard the words, he stopped, looked at Mu Yan, and asked, \u201cDo you still want to sell buns?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s great that everyone can eat delicious buns.\u201dMu Yan said with a smile.In this way, not only can he complete the upgrade task, but more importantly, everyone can also eat delicious buns and feel the charm of food, which makes Mu Yan feel very happy and happy, with a sense of accomplishment.\u201cOkay, then we will continue to sell, but it will not be available in the morning, and it will be sold at noon.\u201d Mu Chen took a step back and said.No matter how those villagers persuaded, Mu Chen was not moved at all, but just one sentence from Mu Yan instantly disintegrated all Mu Chen\u2019s previous persistence.Mu Yan looked at Mu Chen puzzled, in his opinion, steamed stuffed buns are usually eaten in the morning, but if Ah Chen wants to sell them at noon, then he can sell them at noon.\u201cYou need to get up too early in the morning, I feel bad.\u201d Mu Chen gently squeezed Mu Yan\u2019s tender face, and said dotingly.Mu Yan\u2019s somewhat fleshy face blushed quickly at a speed visible to the naked eye, and his heart was sweet, sweeter than eating sugar\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll listen to you.\u201d Mu Yan whispered shyly.Mu Chen hugged the person into his arms, feeling that no amount of hugging was enough, he wished he could directly rub the person into his body, so that he could be with the other person anytime, anywhere.Coaxing Mu Yan, who was blushing and shy, into the bedroom, Mu Chen opened the door again, the group of villagers who hadn\u2019t dispersed at the door were discussing the plan for the next game, when Mu Chen came out again, he seemed to be pressed The pause button is normal, the scene is eerily quiet, and the villagers are bewildered.\u201cStarting tomorrow, buns will be sold on time at 12:00 noon. Until then, don\u2019t appear in my field of vision, otherwise\u2026\u201d Mu Chen said coldly. Subtext, all of them suddenly became excited.\u201cNo problem, no problem, I will definitely come here on time, and I will definitely not be early.\u201d Even if it is early, I will not let you see it, a villager added in his heart.\u201cIs it really going to start selling tomorrow? Great, I\u2019ll go back and tell them.\u201d Another villager ran away excitedly, shouting as he ran, looking like a psychopath.The others were still discussing what to use as if to persuade Mu Chen to continue selling steamed buns, but unexpectedly, the other party changed his mind in a short period of time. There is simply no better news than this.As a result, there were many more villagers rushing to tell each other, and of course, some were also desperate.\u201cOh, these idiots, if we tell more people, then more people will come to grab buns from us. If you know it, you should hide it quietly!\u201d Someone said angrily.The others who hadn\u2019t left immediately felt that what he said made sense, so they pretended not to know anything and left, planning to come back early the next day to buy more.Mu Chen didn\u2019t care what these people were thinking at all, after telling Mu Yan\u2019s words, he immediately closed the gate with a \u201cbang\u201d in front of everyone, but the excited villagers, even if they saw the gate of Mu\u2019s house, , I also think the door is very cute.\u201cAh Chen, let\u2019s go to the forest again and find more wild vegetables to make stuffing.\u201d Mu Yan said to Mu Chen.All the dishes I found before were almost used up on the day of the wedding, and I ate them all in the remaining few days, so basically there is no food at home now, and they haven\u2019t gone to the forest for several days. So tomorrow\u2019s buns still need to find ingredients again.\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Chen replied.The two simply packed up, and then each of them carried a small backpack and headed towards the forest hand in hand.Mu Yan\u2019s small hand was held in Mu Chen\u2019s big hand, feeling the warmth from that hand, his whole body felt warm.These few days are definitely the happiest Mu Yan has ever lived, not to mention those lives in the previous life, even after coming to this world, he has never been as happy as he is now.In this different world, he has a home that really belongs to him, not just a cold house where he can live, but also his closest lover, and there will be a baby belonging to them in the future.If this kind of life can continue, Mu Yan feels that he will die happily.Number five who is dormant: Dear little host, have you forgotten me, I am also a part of the family!Poor number five, in order not to disturb the love between the host and the host\u2019s partner, took the initiative to fall into hibernation. Of course, it may also be to avoid being blinded by the loving couple, after all, it is still a single system.But no matter what, No. 5 fell asleep, and then Mu Yan, who was in the happiness given by Mu Chen, forgot about this poor existence for a short time.Dormant No. 5: Mu Chen is indeed a bad silver, and he robbed TAT of the hostThe ingredients on the edge of the forest near Mu\u2019s house were basically found by Mu Chen and almost picked, so this time, the two decided to walk further along the edge to see if they could find other ingredients.Rather than saying that these two people came out to find ingredients, it would be better to say that these two people were out on a date. Fortunately, no one else was here, otherwise they would definitely be blinded by the sticky relationship.In the morning, the two of them had only just reached the edge of their usual range of activities, which was enough to show how fast the two of them were today, but the two involved did not have the slightest sense of self-awareness.\u201cWhat do you want for lunch? Rabbit meat? Chicken? Or pork?\u201d Mu Chen asked Mu Yan.Because of love at night, Mu Yan eats relatively light food these days, it is rare to come out today, and Mu Chen also hopes that Mu Yan can eat better and eat to his heart\u2019s content.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If you use it more, you will be able to upgrade to the third level soon, and the ingredients that can be identified will be more.\u201cSpeak.\u201d At this moment, No. 5\u2019s extremely resentful voice came from above.Mu Yan looked up and saw No. 5 flying in the sky, and immediately said pleasantly, \u201cNo. 5, you\u2019re awake.\u201dHeartbroken number five: \u2026No. 5 looks at Mu Yan with complex and resentful eyes. The reason why it sleeps is to not disturb the love between the host and the host\u2019s partner. Although it wants to stop it, Yan Yan is obviously very happy, and it has no qualifications to stop it. , it is out of sight and pure, and wakes it up after speaking.However, it didn\u2019t expect that this hibernation lasted for more than a week, and it had been waiting for the little host to wake it up on its own initiative, but it didn\u2019t.In the end, it couldn\u2019t bear it anymore, and woke up from hibernation on its own initiative, and then saw the little host and that man being sweet, kissing me, I had already forgotten about it, and suddenly became like an abandoned person The Journeyman is average.\u201cYanyan, you don\u2019t even think about me.\u201d No. 5 said sadly\u201cI miss you.\u201d Mu Yan said honestly, with a little carelessness in his tone.In fact, in the first few days before No. 5 went dormant, Mu Yan was still not used to the lack of a chatterbox by his side, but gradually, his attention was all on Mu Chen, and Mu Chen would think about it every day. Trying to make Mu Yan happy, naturally he accidentally left No. 5 behind\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you wake me up?\u201d Number Five went on to \u201ccomplain\u201croad.Mu Yan wanted to say something, but he didn\u2019t know what to say. After all, he had always been a good boy and would not lie.Seeing this, No. 5 was literally shot in the heart and shattered into pieces.In fact, it originally wanted the little host to comfort it, but it didn\u2019t expect the little host to be so \u201cupright\u201d, and in the end it was itself that felt stuck.No. 5 decided to turn this matter over, otherwise he must be the one who got hurt in the end.\u201cYanyan, what shall we eat later?\u201d No. 5 changed the subject bluntly. If he was facing someone else, he would definitely be noticed, but if he was facing Mu Yan, then there would be no problem at all.\u201cA-Chen went hunting, and I will have roast chicken for lunch today.\u201d Mu Yan saidNot long after the words were finished, Mu Chen was seen walking towards this side with two chickens in his hand, Mu Yan immediately dropped No. 5 and rushed towards Mu Chen.Seeing this, Number Five suddenly felt a little stuffy again.Skillfully lit the fire, put the processed chicken on wooden sticks, and roasted it on the fire.As the person who often watches Mu Yan cook, Mu Chen already has a good grasp of these dishes, so he is basically cooking these days, while Mu Yan only needs to open his mouth to eat.Not long after, the skin of the pheasant was roasted and browned, and the fragrance gradually came out. The tempted No. 5, who hadn\u2019t eaten the food made by Mu Yan for several days, almost drooled.\u201cIt smells so good, Ah Chen, you are so amazing.\u201d Sitting at the side, Mu Yan couldn\u2019t help but praise.\u201cMu Mu is still amazing, and Mu Mu\u2019s roasting is even more fragrant.\u201d Mu Chen also praised Mu Yan without hesitation.\u201cTsk tsk\u2026you two are really enough, the flesh is not nasty, I am still here, you want to praise each other if you can be alone.\u201d Number five couldn\u2019t help rubbing his chubby body without goosebumps at all, couldn\u2019t help but said with disdain.Hearing this, Mu Yan immediately lowered his head to cover his blushing face.How could he forget that number five was still there? He was so shy just now.Mu Chen glanced lightly at the place where No. 5 was, and then continued to roll the roast chicken in his hand.Number five clearly felt the other party\u2019s gaze. Although it was only for a moment, the familiar feeling brought back its previous memories.It can\u2019t fool itself into thinking that Mu Chen just looked in its direction by coincidence, because this is not the first time this has happened.No. 5 looked at Mu Chen in horror, it can be sure that it is absolutely invisible to everyone except the small host, and other people must not be able to see it, but Mu Chen can find it accurately every time It can only be said that this man\u2019s sensitivity is too strong, so strong that even if he can\u2019t see it, he can easily find its position just by intuition.How powerful this kind of sensitivity should be, it was only felt on one person before, but the plane where that person is located is much higher than here, and the people there are also much stronger than here, but I did not expect , In this plane, another one was discovered.Number five doesn\u2019t know if this is a good thing, but for now, it shouldn\u2019t be the worst, after all Mu Chen is the man of its little host.Even so, No. 5 did not dare to be too active, for fear of being stared at by Mu Chen again. As far as its observations during this period of time are concerned, except for its little host who can get all the tenderness and attention from this man, no one else In Mu Chen\u2019s eyes, they are all the same.The reason why his terror was not revealed was because his little host was by his side. Once the little host was gone, or something happened, this man might become a very terrifying existence.\u201cIs it cooked? I can smell it more fragrant.\u201d Mu Yan looked at the roast chicken on the wooden stick anxiously.In the past few days, he has been eating very lightly every day. Now that he sees the roast chicken, he can\u2019t wait to eat the whole thing.Naturally, Mu Chen also saw the longing eyes of his little lover, and his mood suddenly became better. Being able to feed his little lover is really a very happy and fulfilling thing, and seeing his little lover eat happily When I was eating, I was happier than eating it myself.Food, indeed, is an amazing thing.What Mu Chen didn\u2019t know was that food is of course amazing, because it can not only make human beings feel better after eating, but even animals will be attracted by delicious food.In a bush not far from the two people\u2019s system, a pair of green eyes stared at the roast chicken on the wooden stick for a moment. From the first smell of the roast chicken, it was there.Seeing Mu Yan eating the grilled chicken with a satisfied face now makes him even more eager to move.Mu Chen glanced at the bushes, then continued to feed his little lover.\u201cTear, tear, hiss\u2026\u201d A thin voice came from the grass, Mu Yan and No. 5, who were enjoying the delicious roast chicken, didn\u2019t notice it, but Mu Chen\u2019s movements paused a little.\u201cIt smells so good, Chen, you should eat more.\u201d Mu Yan tore off a big drumstick from the roast chicken, and then held it up to Mu Chen\u2019s mouth.Mu Chen smiled, took a bite of Mu Yan\u2019s hand, then carefully tore off the tenderest piece of meat from the roast chicken, and fed it into Mu Yan\u2019s mouth.\u201cHissing and tearing\u2026\u201d The voice became louder, and it seemed to be mixed with a hint of impatience, especially when seeing that the roast chicken was getting less and less, even the surrounding grass moved weakly.In the end, the creature that had been hiding seemed to have made up its mind, and quickly sprang out from the grass, heading straight for the remaining pheasantIf there were only Mu Yan and No. 5 at the moment, maybe this outsider could steal food successfully. However, with Mu Chen around, let alone one, even if there is one, don\u2019t even think about taking away even a piece of Mu Chen from him. Yan chicken.\u201cHiss, hiss\u2026\u201d The little thing was caught by Mu Chen, and he screamed more urgently, his voice was still immature, obviously he was still a cub. This time, even Mu Yan and Number Five were alarmed.\u201cAh, it\u2019s a snake, Ah Chen, let it go quickly, it will bite you.\u201d After Mu Yan saw clearly what Mu Chen was holding, he instinctively took a few steps back in fright, his little face turned pale, Hastily said to Mu Chen.In the previous life, someone in their village was bitten by a snake on the back mountain, and then died soon, and there was no way to save him, so Mu Yan was very impressed with the snake.Seeing that Mu Chen was still holding on to the snake, he became even more frightened. He hastily picked up the stick with which the pheasant was strung, suppressed the fear in his heart, and blocked Mu Chen behind him, trying to use the stick to kill the snake. the snake is beaten awayMu Chen\u2019s eyes looking at Mu Yan became softer, and he couldn\u2019t see his usual cold look.This person is obviously very scared, but he bravely stood in front of him, using his thin body to help him block the danger in front of him. How can such a person not be moved, even in his cold heart, he should melt Bar.At the beginning, he was seriously injured and fell in the forest. In fact, when Mu Yan approached, he was still conscious, but because of the severe injury, he couldn\u2019t open his eyes or speak at all.Then, in the dark, I listened to the whisper of the young man in front of me, and helped him scrub the wound. He was obviously very scared, but he still didn\u2019t abandon himself. He was so thin and small that he couldn\u2019t bear himself at all, but he still made a tool, step by step. Difficult to drag him forward together.Even in difficulties, he never thought of leaving him, this is his little lover, how can he not be moved, not love his little lover.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d\u201cDing, Jasper Snake belongs to the snake family. It is non-poisonous and good at finding ingredients. It is edible.\u201dMu Chen and the system\u2019s voice sounded at the same time, Mu Yan was stunned for a while, and then saw Mu Chen clenched his fingers, the little green snake struggled more violently, and the voice became more shrill.\u201cYanyan, let Mu Chen let go of the little snake quickly, and don\u2019t kill the little snake.\u201d Number Five said hastily.\u201cAchen, don\u2019t kill it, it\u2019s not poisonous.\u201d Mu Yan hurriedly stopped him.Stop the road.The identification technique of the system just now worked again. When it was identified as non-toxic, Mu Yan breathed a sigh of relief, as long as it is not poisonous.\u201cYanyan, this is a treasure.\u201d No. 5 looked at the little emerald green snake and said with glowing eyes, \u201cJasper snake is good at finding ingredients, it\u2019s very good (four beeps) to eat, as long as it\u2019s around, we In the future, we will be able to easily find more ingredients, I never thought that there would be jasper snakes in this world, we are so lucky.\u201d No. 5 said excitedly.If the identification technique hadn\u2019t worked just now, it wouldn\u2019t have realized that it was a rare \u201clittle expert in finding ingredients\u201d jasper snake.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 - Covenant Jasper SnakePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAre you good at finding ingredients? Mu Yan thought in surprise.Although I don\u2019t know how it did it, but just based on this, the little snake\u2019s life is saved. After all, what Mu Yan needs most now is ingredients, and he doesn\u2019t know much about ingredients in this world. Every time, the net is cast in a large area, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive.If there is a jasper snake, maybe these things will become much easier and simpler.After Mu Chen heard Mu Yan\u2019s words, he really didn\u2019t hold the Jasper snake tightly, but he didn\u2019t let it escape either.The little jasper snake exhausted its strength just now, and now it is resting on Mu Chen\u2019s finger weakly. If the snake has an expression, it must have a look of lovelessness.\u201cYanyan, quickly sign a contract with this jasper snake.\u201d Voice No. 5 said eagerly.\u201cSign the contract? How do you sign it?\u201d Mu Yan asked puzzled.\u201cYou put your hand on the Jasper Snake, and then the system has a clause that can sign a contract. You only need to drop a drop of blood on the Jasper Snake, and the contract can be successfully signed.\u201d The guide No. 5 said.Mu Yan stretched out his hand to touch the Jasper Snake according to his words, but Mu Chen grabbed that small hand and held the Jasper Snake further away.\u201cBe careful that it bites you. If you want to touch it, I will kill it. You are touching it.\u201d Mu Chen said calmly.Jasper Snake seemed to understand Mu Chen\u2019s words, and immediately raised his small head with the little strength left, his small eyes looked at Mu Yan pitifully, as if he was asking for help from Mu Yan.It has to be said that this snake is also spiritually connected, and seems to know that Mu Chen will listen to Mu Yan, so instead of begging for mercy from Mu Chen who controls its destiny, it begs for help from the thinner Mu Yan.\u201cI won\u2019t touch it anymore, Ah Chen, this little snake is so cute, shall we keep it?\u201d Mu Yan still thought that this snake is good at finding food, but he couldn\u2019t tell Mu Chen the reason, so he had to He found another reason, but this made him feel more guilty towards Mu Chen.In his mind, a lover is the person closest to him, the one who can share everything, but he conceals Chen about the system and his own life experience, all these make Mu Yan feel guilty towards Mu Chen.Mu Chen saw that Mu Yan\u2019s mood became depressed, and the words that came to his lips immediately changed to, \u201cOkay, we will keep it.\u201dMu Yan stepped forward gently, took the initiative to hug Mu Chen, rubbed his small head on the wide and comfortable chest, and said: \u201cAh Chen, you are so kind to me.\u201dWith his free hand, Mu Chen stroked Mu Yan\u2019s soft hair, with the same doting smile on his mouth, \u201cI don\u2019t treat you well.Mu Yan closed his eyes slightly, feeling the temperature from Mu Chen\u2019s body and the strong heartbeat.If No. 5 went to listen to Mu Yan\u2019s heart at this moment, he would definitely be taken aback by Mu Yan\u2019s thoughts, and he would not be panicked because he was completely unprepared.A good date in the forest ended because of encountering a jasper snake that was stealing food.Mu Yan found some rattan, weaved it into a small cage, and then carefully put the jasper snake in it. Of course, Mu Chen was still holding the small cage, because he was worried that Mu Yan would be bitten, even if it was It doesn\u2019t even work if it\u2019s not poisonous.\u201cYanyan, let\u2019s find a chance to make a contract with the Jade Snake quietly at night, so that the Jade Snake will listen to you in the future.\u201d No. 5 said quietly to Mu Yan, as if quietly discussing how to do bad things.No matter how loud No. 5 spoke, no one else could hear it except Mu Yan, but No. 5 still chose to speak in a low voice, experiencing the thrill of whispering.\u201cYeah.\u201d Mu Yan also answered in a low voice in his mind, rarely absent-minded.Mu Yan was led back by Mu Chen along the way, he trusted Mu Chen very much, and let Mu Chen lead him while he let himself go blank.Seeing Mu Yan\u2019s dumbfounded look, Mu Chen felt his heart softened.He didn\u2019t walk fast, mainly because he was worried that Mu Yan would trip over or be unable to keep up. Of course, he also wanted to get along with Mu Yan for a longer time.However, no matter how slow he walked, there was still a moment when he returned home. When he saw a familiar house appearing in his field of vision, Mu Yan, who was in a daze, finally came back to his senses.\u201cAre you home?\u201d Mu Yan asked blankly.\u201cWell, welcome home.\u201d Mu Chen said in a rare joke, and then walked into the house holding his little lover\u2019s hand.The word \u201chome\u201d is really the most beautiful word in the world.Mu Chen threw away the cage containing the jasper snake, then led Mu Yan back to the room.\u201cMumu, lie down and rest for a while, I\u2019ll make dinner.\u201d Mu Chen coaxed, then took off Mu Yan\u2019s coat and shoes with his own hands, and carefully tucked him in the quilt.\u201cI\u2019m not tired, I\u2019ll cook dinner with you.\u201d Mu Yan said as he wanted to get up, but the quilt on his body was pressed by Mu Chen and he couldn\u2019t move.\u201cHey, sleep for a while, it will be fine soon.\u201d Mu Chen\u2019s big hand gently patted Mu Yan\u2019s back through the quilt, like a mother coaxing a baby to sleep.Feel average.Mu Yan didn\u2019t feel sleepy at first, but under Mu Chen\u2019s gentle pat, his eyelids became heavier and heavier, and finally fell into a deep sleep.\u201cBaby, have a good rest.\u201d Mu Chen pressed a kiss on Mu Yan\u2019s forehead, then got up and went to the kitchen to make dinner.\u201cYanyan, Yanyan, wake up quickly, let\u2019s go and give the Jasper Snake to the contract.\u201d No. 5 saw Mu Chen walk into the kitchen, so he hurried to wake Mu Yan up.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Mu Yan, who was soundly asleep under Mu Chen\u2019s comfort, heard the noisy voice in his ear, couldn\u2019t help but turned over and gave a warning, but there was no sign of waking up.In fact, No. 5 didn\u2019t want to disturb Mu Yan\u2019s sleep, but now the opportunity is rare, if he misses this time, it will be difficult to find another opportunity under that man\u2019s nose in the future.Therefore, Number Five could only continue calling Mu Yan persistently.\u201cNumber five?\u201d Mu Yan stretched out his hand and rubbed his eyes, feeling a little sleepy. \u201cYanyan, let\u2019s hurry up and give the Jasper Snake to the contract.\u201d Number Five said eagerly.That man has always been cooking very fast, who knows if he will come back suddenly, so he must hurry up.\u201cOh.\u201d Mu Yan slowly got off the bed, seeing that No. 5 wanted to go forward and give him a hand.When he came back, Mu Chen casually threw the small cage containing the jasper snake into the yard, so now he still needs to go to the yard to find the little snake, and there is a great possibility that Mu Chen will find it in the yard.\u2013 Time, this person-system is a bit tangled.\u201cWhat should we do, No. 5?\u201d Mu Yan stood by the bedroom window, looking at the yard outside, and asked.No. 5 wrinkled his furry little face. If he removed the hair all over his body, he would look like a little bun.\u201cI don\u2019t know, let me think about it.\u201d No. 5 started his little head that he doesn\u2019t use often, trying to think of various solutions, but before he could discuss it with Mu Yan, he let himself veto it. .Suddenly, No. 5 had a rare flash of inspiration, proudly raised his inconspicuous small chest, and excitedly said to Mu Yan: \u201cYan Yan, I thought of it, you give me your blood, and I will drip it on the Jasper Snake for you.\u201d body, wouldn\u2019t the contract be successful?\u201dNumber Five is extremely proud of his idea, it really is the smartest and most useful system, much better than someone\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Yan replied, then looked at his white and tender little hands, and suddenly asked, \u201cWhere do you want the blood from?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026anywhere should be fine, or just the ones in your hands, which shouldn\u2019t hurt too much.\u201d Number Five said, his voice was much weaker than before. For some reason, he always felt trembling and a little uneasy. a feeling of.Mu Yan looked at his little hands, not knowing where to start, so he asked No. 5 again.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you find something sharper to scratch?\u201d Number Five suggested, the feeling of trepidation in his heart became more obvious, and it even gave him an urge to run away.It\u2019s really strange, how can there be such a feeling for no reason? Number Five is very puzzled.Mu Yan never thought of actively hurting himself, after all, \u201cthe body, hair and skin are the parents\u201d, but when he thought that if he contracted the jasper snake, it would be much easier to find ingredients in the future, so he made up his mind again.However, Mu Yan searched around the room and found nothing sharp.No. 5 kept searching the room with his eyes, after all, this small bedroom is the only place they can move about now.Suddenly, No. 5\u2019s eyes fell on something, and he hurriedly said to Mu Yan: \u201cYanyan, how about we\u2026\u201dAfter hearing No. 5\u2019s words, Mu Yan walked to the bedside and picked up a glass on the bedside. Mu Chen was worried that Mu Yan would be thirsty after waking up, so he poured a glass of water and put it here. It is also the only sharp thing that can cut through fingers.Mu Yan drank all the water in it, then the glass fell out of his hand and fell to the ground, breaking with a \u201cclick\u201d.\u201cYanyan, hurry up.\u201d No. 5 hurriedly said to Mu Yan, because it saw someone who heard the voice seemed to be coming towards this side.Mu Yan didn\u2019t think too much, and cut his fingertips without hesitation, oozing out small drops of blood.Seeing this, No. 5 hurried forward, using the power of the system to wrap the small blood bead intact, and then quickly flew out of the window, heading straight for the Jade Snake.\u201cMu Mu, what happened?\u201d Mu Chen ran in as fast as he could when he heard the noise, and after seeing the broken glass on the ground, he nervously checked Mu Yan: \u201cIs there any injury? Where did it hurt?\u201dMu Chen checked Mu Yan up and down worriedly, when he saw the little finger that was still oozing blood, he immediately put it in his mouth with distress, and licked it lightly, lest it would hurt his hand if it was too heavy.\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m fine.\u201d Mu Yan lowered his head and didn\u2019t dare to look at Mu ChenEspecially Mu Chen\u2019s distressed and worried expression poked Mu Yan\u2019s heart one after another, making him feel guilty and afraid to face him.Ah Chen, who was hurt because of his own selfishness, was worried and distressed, but he still couldn\u2019t tell him the truth, which made Mu Yan feel very uncomfortable.\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay, it won\u2019t hurt soon.\u201d While comforting Mu Yan, Mu Chen gently hugged the person horizontally, away from the glass shards on the ground, put the person on the bed, and then picked up the person from the bedside table. Take out the best wound medicine, which is left after Dr. Li treated Mu Chen\u2019s wound last time.Mu Chen gently applied the medicine to Mu Yan, that cautious attitude was like treating his most precious and fragile treasure.\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Mu Yan apologized softly, his big eyes became moist because of Mu Chen\u2019s gentle actions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I wanted to tell Ah Chen about the system several times, but I didn\u2019t know how to start.\u201cHey, sit here for a while, I\u2019ll clean up all the shards of glass.\u201d Mu Chen pressed a kiss on the injured finger again, then got up to sweep out the shards of glass.At this moment, Mu Yan felt a very strange feeling, and before he had time to feel it carefully, he heard the voice of No. 5: \u201cYan Yan, is the contract successful?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Mu Yan looked at No. 5 in a daze.\u201cQuickly open the system panel and have a look.\u201d Number Five said.Mu Yan opened the system panel according to his words, and suddenly there was an extra column on the left side of the system panel.Pet Column: Jasper SnakeThere is also a portrait that is exactly the same as the jasper snake painted on the back, exactly like the real one.In fact, this was originally true. After No. 5 dripped Mu Yan\u2019s blood on Jasper Snake, Jasper Snake made a contract with Mu Yan, and then disappeared from the original place, becoming the portrait behind the pet bar on the system panel Yes, when you need it, just call it directly.\u201cYanyan, please give the Jade Snake a name, so that it will be much more convenient to summon it in the future.\u201d Number Five said.\u201cWell\u2026 let\u2019s call it Xiaolu.\u201d Mu Yan looked at the jasper snake\u2019s whole body, which was emerald green and glittering, so he said.After Mu Yan finished speaking, the back of the Jasper Snake in the pet column changed, and the word \u201cLittle Green\u201d appeared.\u201cYanyan, try summoning, you only need to call Xiaolu\u2019s name to summon it.\u201d No. 5 guided.\u201cLittle Green.\u201d Mu Yan called.Then in the next second, a crystal clear little snake appeared in Mu Yan\u2019s hands out of thin air, and rubbed against his fingers affectionately.The little snake\u2019s body was cool and slippery, and it was very comfortable to be rubbed against.The little snake climbed up along Mu Yan\u2019s fingers, to the wrist, connecting end to end, looking from a distance, it looked like a clear jade bracelet.Mu Yan opened his eyes wide, looking at the little snake in surprise, he was very happy in his heart, and all the fear of snakes faded away at this moment.\u201cYanyan, you are going back silently, take Xiaolu back and try.\u201d Number Five continued.So, Mu Yan said \u201cgo back\u201d silently in his heart, and sure enough the \u201cbracelet\u201d on his wrist disappeared, and the portrait appeared again behind the jasper snake on the system panel.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d Mu Yan\u2019s eyes sparkled, as if he got a very fun toy.\u201cIt\u2019s very powerful, but it\u2019s far more than that. When your level is higher in the future, there will be more fun functions.\u201d No. 5 said proudly.\u201cYeah.\u201d Mu Yan nodded his head vigorously, looking forward to it.Mu Chen didn\u2019t pay much attention to the disappearance of the jasper snake. After all, he didn\u2019t want the little snake to occupy Mu Yan\u2019s attention. What\u2019s more, it was always dangerous to stay here. He originally planned to throw it away or Kill it directly, and now it slips away by itself, which is even more troublesome.However, because of this jasper snake, Mu Chen and Mu Yan\u2019s original plans to find ingredients were all disrupted. They came back too early, so they didn\u2019t find much ingredients, and they were far from the steamed stuffed buns they wanted to make before. quantityLooking at these ingredients, Mu Yan felt a little worried.\u201cThey do as much as they want, they don\u2019t mind waiting an extra day.\u201d Mu Chen said comfortingly.In fact, what he really wants to say is that those people are good enough to eat what they have, how dare they think too little? Those who dare to dislike too little will not be sold to him in the future, let\u2019s see if he still dares to dislike it.\u201cOkay.\u201d After hearing Mu Chen\u2019s words, Mu Yan no longer struggled. He chopped up all the wild vegetables and added some pork left over to make pork stuffing. Reconcile, wait for the release tomorrow morning, then you can make buns.Because there is no need to sell in the morning, Mu Yan didn\u2019t get up early. When he woke up, the sun was already high, and there was still a hot breakfast on the bedside. Obviously Mu Chen had already woken up, and even gave breakfast to him. it is done.Mu Yan stared blankly at the hot breakfast, with a sweet look on his face.After Mu Yan had breakfast and packed up the dinner plate and was ready to take it to the kitchen for cleaning, he realized that Mu Chen was already sitting in the kitchen making buns, and it was almost the end of the process.Wooden words: 5: (\u00b0\u25b3.\u4e28im\u201cMu Mu, put the bowl over there, I\u2019ll wash it after I pack it.\u201d Seeing Mu Yan coming in, Mu Chen said with a smile.\u201cAh Chen, you, have you finished making buns?\u201d Mu Yan looked at the white, fat, round and cute buns on the curtain, and said in surprise.\u201cI can\u2019t fall asleep when I wake up in the morning, and I have nothing to do, so I just thought about making some steamed buns first.\u201d Mu Chen said with a smile, the movements of his hands did not delay at all, and a white steamed stuffed bun was ready in almost a few seconds. His hands are done.Watching Mu Chen make buns is simply a visual enjoyment. Mu Yan never thought that someone would make buns so beautifully.But is the fact really what Mu Chen said?In fact, Mu Chen already had his own plans when he asked Mu Yan to change the time of selling steamed buns to noon, but naturally he would not tell Mu Yan.\u201cI, let me help you.\u201d Mu Yan saw that there was not much dough and stuffing left, and wanted to add it, but was stopped by Mu Chen.\u201cThere is not much left, it will be fine soon, don\u2019t get your hands dirty.\u201d Mu Chen said softly, and then sped up his hand movements again.Mu Yan couldn\u2019t tell what he was feeling in his heart, but he knew that touching and sweetness must be the majority.He had always fantasized about marrying a man who loves him, but he also knew that it was just a self-deceiving fantasy. Even in their village, there are very few men who can really love his brother. , live together.But he didn\u2019t expect that in this world without brothers and men, his wish would come true, and it was even more beautiful than he imagined, which made him feel unreal like dreaming.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You haven\u2019t woken up yet?\u201d Mu Chen, who finished making the buns, saw that Mu Yan was in a daze, so he couldn\u2019t help stretching out a finger to poke him lightly.Seeing some white nutrition powder stained on that fair cheek, matched with Mu Yan\u2019s dumbfounded expression, Mu Chen\u2019s heart shrank suddenly, and he was immediately turned into a bud.\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m going to steam the buns.\u201d When Mu Yan came back to his senses, seeing Mu Chen\u2019s funny expression, his face blushed, and he shyly found a reason to divert his attention.\u201cIt\u2019s still early, let\u2019s start steaming after ten o\u2019clock.\u201d Mu Chen stopped Mu Yan, and then handed him some snacks that he made in the morning to pass the time, and then took Mu Yan\u2019s previous ones. The dishes were washed.The current life of the two can be said to be very leisurely and comfortable. They can sleep until they wake up naturally in the morning, earn credits by selling buns at noon, and go to the forest to find some ingredients when they have time in the afternoon.Now the two of them can be completely self-sufficient, they don\u2019t need to go to the factory to earn credits with the villagers, their time is completely controlled by themselves, and they live a fulfilling and happy life.There is a very beautiful swing in the yard, which was made by Mu Chen himself, and when Mu Yan is free, he likes to sit on it and bask in the sun, shaking gently while being warmed by the sun.\u201cYanyan, he\u2019s gone too far. He even wrapped all the buns by himself without asking you to do anything. So when will your task be completed?\u201d Number five was going crazy.\u201cI, I\u2019ll get up earlier next time.\u201d Mu Yan replied weakly, but he was not as worried and crazy as No. 5, but sweet, the kind of being cared for and loved by others The feeling made him extremely happy.Seeing Mu Yan like this, No. 5 knew what he was thinking without prying, and sighed deeply. He had no choice but to get up early tomorrow and pack more.However, the expectations of No. 5 were all shattered soon.Because, for the next few days, no matter how early Mu Yan got up, he would find that Mu Chen got up earlier than him, and when he got up, Mu Chen had already finished wrapping the buns.Sometimes, in order to be able to get up in front of Mu Chen, Mu Yan specially asked No. 5 to wake him up at regular intervals, but even so, Mu Chen would still put him to sleep when he woke up. It has been hung up high for a long time, and the buns have all been wrapped.Wooden words: ..Number Five: ..\u201cAhhh! This guy must be intentional, it must be intentional! So many tasks are wasted!\u201d No. 5 really went crazy, thinking that there are so many steamed buns. If it can be counted as a task, he feels distressed for a while. If these are all done by his little host, it would be great, maybe they will be upgraded.Mu Yan ran up to Mu Chen, pretending to be serious with a small face, and said, \u201cAh Chen, I want to get up with you every day to make buns.For several days in a row, Ah Chen completed this work by himself. It was a bit too hard. He had done this before and naturally knew the hard work. He didn\u2019t want Ah Chen to work hard alone, he also wanted to work with Ah Chen. Chen shared some, but Ah Chen would stop him with various reasons every time, which made him feel sweet and at the same time feel sorry for Ah Chen.So, after Mu Yan thought about it for a long time, he finally mustered up the courage to talk to Mu Chen face to face about this matter.\u201cHey, there are not many buns, I can finish them by myself, you can sleep more.\u201d Mu Chen said in a gentle voice, with a sense of reassurance.\u201cBut, but\u2026 Ah Chen, you will be very hard. I want to do it with you, and I don\u2019t want you to work so hard.\u201d Mu Yan\u2019s little hands anxiously grabbed Mu Chen\u2019s sleeves, his little face was full of distress and worry.At this moment, Mu Chen felt that no matter how hard he worked, it was worth it, and his little lover loved him dearly.\u201cMumu is even harder. You need to find new ingredients in the forest every day, which consumes a lot of mental and physical energy. If you don\u2019t rest well in the morning, you won\u2019t have the energy to look for them in the afternoon, so let me make breakfast and steamed buns. , Mu Mu spends energy on more important things.\u201d Mu Chen kept persuading Mu Yan with his magnetic and pleasant voice, with a feeling of bewitching.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 - binding partnerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn a daze, Mu Yan felt that what A Chen said was very reasonable, and he was persuaded in a daze like this, forgetting his original intention of talking to Mu Chen.No. 5 watched the entire conversation, feeling powerless at the low resistance of his little host to Mu Chen.How can you be persuaded so easily? Hey!\u201cYanyan, what should we do with our mission?\u201d No. 5 was really worried that the hair on his body was about to fall off. If this continued, they would not even want to be promoted to level three.Mu Yan blushed when he heard the words, and felt a little shy, a little sorry for No. 5, but that thought reappeared strongly in his mind again, making him even more determined.Mu Yan called up the system panel, and when No. 5 saw it, he had a very bad premonition for some reason.And this premonition became stronger when he saw the place Mu Yan pointed at.\u201cYanyan, what are you going to do?\u201d No. 5 didn\u2019t even realize it, and there was a trace of tremor in its voice.For the first time, Mu Yan did not answer No. 5\u2019s question, but looked at the button behind the \u201cbinding partner\u201d on the panel, and pressed it without the slightest hesitation.\u201cNo!\u201d No. 5\u2019s shrill voice sounded, but it was still a step too late after all.\u201cPlease host to enter the name of the partner to be bound.\u201d The system\u2019s cold voice appeared again.\u201cMu Chen.\u201d Mu Yan said firmly with a small face.\u201cYanyan, are you going crazy? How can you bind your partner?\u201d No. 5 tried hard to stop Mu Yan\u2019s behavior, but no matter what it said, Mu Yan remained unmoved. According to the system\u2019s prompt, The binding of partners is completed step by step.\u201cNo. 5, Ah Chen is my partner, and he wants to live with me for the rest of his life. I can\u2019t hide this from him all my life. Isn\u2019t the most important thing between a husband and wife is sincerity?\u201d Mu Yan said calmly, But his heart was very restless.Ever since he married Mu Chen, Mu Yan has been suffering in his heart, and this suffering comes from the system.Mu Yan is a brother who traveled from a traditional world. His thoughts are as traditional as the traditional world he lives in. At home, a man is heaven.In their place, brothers are all man-centered, and they have almost no reservations about men. Of course, the men in their place will not betray brothers.Therefore, in Mu Yan\u2019s heart, the union between him and Mu Chen is for a lifetime, and they will never be separated. In this case, he will naturally share the secrets of the system with his partner. It was because of No. will remain hidden until now.But Ah Chen is really too kind to him, every time Ah Chen treats him well, it will make him feel ashamed at the same time sweetly, because he has no reservations about Ah Chen, he also hides the secrets of Ah Chen\u2019s system Secret, it made him feel that he couldn\u2019t be true to Ah Chen, and it also made him suffer a lotToday, after he bound Mu Chen as a system partner, this torment finally disappeared, and his heart really relaxed.It was the first time No. 5 saw Mu Yan like this, so he couldn\u2019t say anything for a while.\u201cForget it, let\u2019s just bind it, so that many things will become more convenient in the future, and when we go to the forest in the future, we can also take out the kitchen utensils from the system without worrying about being suspected by him\u2026\u201d No. 5 continued Talking about the benefits of being bound to a partner, trying to convince himself.Here, one person and one system are talking about their hearts, and Mu Chen in the yard is definitely no less shocked than No. 5. Just now, he suddenly heard a voice, \u201cYou have been bound as the partner of the host Mu Yan, and have some system permissions. \u201c.When this voice sounded, Mu Chen\u2019s whole body became alert, his eyes that were always gentle when he saw Mu Yan became sharp and deep, and he looked around with a vigilant expression, finally found that the voice seemed to come from his own mind. sent out.Mu Chen didn\u2019t know what that was, but the word Mu Yan gave him a clue, and he was slightly relieved.Just in time, Mu Yan came out of the house at this moment, took the initiative to walk to Mu Chen\u2019s side, and then explained the system and his life experience secrets to Mu Chen one by one. Obviously dissatisfied.\u201cHmph, Yanyan, why did you tell him so detailed? Almost none of my previous hosts had any binding partners. You actually bound this guy. Really\u2026\u201d No. 5 said dissatisfiedly, but the words just Halfway through speaking, he was completely frozen by that icy gaze.This time, the coldness of the gaze became more substantive, and No. 5 remembered that the other party had been bound by Mu Yan as a system partner, so he could see him.No. 5: Z(\u00b0\u25b3.\u4e28\u4e28|)|Damn it, why did it forget such an important thing? In the past, when Mu Chen couldn\u2019t see it, he could always accurately capture its position. Now that he can see it, then it will have a good life in the future Can I pass? Yanyan, you shouldn\u2019t bind your partners! !No. 5 now regrets not being able to stop Mu Yan\u2019s behavior in time, this incident is just digging a hole and jumping into it.Immediately, Number Five became unlovable.Mu Chen glanced coldly at the hairball flying in midair. He always felt that there was something in midair before, but he didn\u2019t expect it to be there. According to Mu Mu, this thing should be the system elf Well, since Mumu first appeared in this world, he has been by Mumu\u2019s side, even earlier than him!Thinking of this, Mu Chen\u2019s heart felt slightly sour, and his gaze towards No. 5 became even sharper, as if he wanted to kill it directly with his eyes, so scared that No. 5 immediately flew into Mu Yan\u2019s arms, Seeking protection, but not thinking about it, this move of it has laid a firm foundation for its tragic future.\u201cAh Chen, you\u2026will you blame me?\u201d Mu Yan secretly glanced at Mu Chen anxiously, not daring to look directly at him, after all, he had kept him a secret for so long.Mu Chen withdrew his cold eyes from No. 5, and when facing Mu Yan, he became that gentle and nostalgic Mu Chen again.Holding Mu Yan tightly into his arms, he said softly, \u201cHow can I blame you? I\u2019m very happy that you can share this with me.\u201dMu Yan was able to tell these secrets, he must have accumulated a lot of courage, such a Mu Mu, how could he be willing to blame, he loves him too late.For another person, let alone share these secrets with him, I am afraid that I will always be on guard against myself to prevent myself from knowing these things. However, this little fool in my arms has all done it on his own initiative. , how can he rest assured that if he is left alone, he will definitely be bulliedSo, don\u2019t want him to let go of him in this life, he will love him, love him, and protect him for the rest of his life as he said at the wedding!\u201cAchen, you\u2019re so kind.\u201d Mu Yan took the initiative to put his arms around the other\u2019s waist, resting his little head on the chest, rubbing his head attached, with a sweet and happy smile on his face.Ah Chen didn\u2019t even blame him for hiding him, that\u2019s great.\u201cMu Mu, meeting you is my luck.\u201d Mu Chen said sincerely.Perhaps, the reason for having no memory is to be able to meet Mumu. If you can spend the rest of your life with Mumu, even if you can\u2019t get back your memory, it doesn\u2019t matter.Seeing the two hugging together on the 5th, they were suddenly shown a face of affection and stuffed with dog food, which was even worse than before, and suddenly felt a little lonely and cold by themselves.Afterwards, Mu Chen hugged Mu Yan and sat on the spacious swing, opened the system panel together, and then Mu Yan carefully explained the system\u2019s functions to Mu Chen, so that no one else could get in between the two of them.Seeing the two of them as one, No. 5 felt even more distressed, and flew directly to the bedroom, trying to keep out of sight.\u201cAchen, look, this is a system upgrade task, and you can upgrade after it is completed.\u201d Mu Yan pointed to the task progress bar and said.\u201cUpgrade mission?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s just making steamed stuffed buns. You need to make a thousand steamed stuffed buns to upgrade, but we don\u2019t have flour, so we can only use nutritional powder instead. Maybe thousands of steamed stuffed buns need to be made.\u201d Mu Yan said.\u201cSo you want to continue selling steamed stuffed buns because you want to complete the task?\u201d Mu Chen suddenly figured out many things.\u201cYeah.\u201d Mu Yan nodded.\u201cThen this steamed bun must be made by you to count?\u201d Mu Chen remembered that a few days ago, Mu Yan always tried to get up early to make steamed buns with himCome.\u201cIt was before, but now what you do can be counted, but you may need to do more to be counted as one.\u201d Mu Yan said, although he didn\u2019t say it very clearly, but the smart Mu Chen understood it.This is better, he can do the upgrade task in the future, so that Mumu will not be so tired.\u201cMumu, why do you suddenly want to share this secret with me?\u201d Mu Chen is very curious about this, is it because he wants to upgrade the buns he made?For some reason, he always felt that it was not because of this.\u201cBecause we are husband and wife, shouldn\u2019t we be honest between husband and wife? Earlier, No. 5 said that it is dangerous to bond with a partner, so he won\u2019t let me bond, but Ah Chen is so good to me, I like Ah Chen.\u201d Yan snuggled into Mu Chen\u2019s arms.Although there are no gorgeous love words, but such simple and plain words moved Mu Chen even more.Although No. 5 seems unreliable, some words are reasonable\u201cMumu, don\u2019t mention the system to anyone in the future,Don\u2019t even bind your partner. Number five is right. Binding a partner is very dangerous. \u201cMu Chen told Mu Yan seriously.On the one hand, it is because people\u2019s hearts are unpredictable, and binding partners are indeed very dangerous. If one is not careful, Mu Yan may be in danger because of the system, but on the other hand, it is also his selfishness. He hopes that only him It is special for Muyan.\u201cExcept for Chen, I haven\u2019t told anyone, not even Aunt Lin and Uncle Yang, and there is only one binding partner, because Chen is Mu Yan\u2019s partner.\u201d Mu Yan said shyly .Although he didn\u2019t finish the rest of the sentence, Mu Chen understood it.How lucky he was to meet such a precious treasure.\u201cMumu, you are such a baby, you are my own baby.\u201d Mu Chen hugged Mu Yan tightly, raised his shy little face, which was flushed red, and kissed his seductive red lips. Go down, caress each other, exchange body fluid, and feel each other\u2019s existence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The buns that were originally scheduled to start steaming at ten o\u2019clock were not served in the steamer until almost twelve o\u2019clock, and those customers who got the news were waiting there even earlier. Near Mu\u2019s house, I plan to quickly come over and queue up as soon as twelve o\u2019clock. At this time, the comparison is everyone\u2019s reaction ability and speedMu Chen\u2019s facial features are very sensitive, he can hear everything outside clearly, not to mention those customers who didn\u2019t think of lowering the volume.\u201cYou sit here first, I\u2019ll put the buns on the steamer.\u201d Mu Chen said to Mu Yan.\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d Mu Yan grabbed Mu Chen\u2019s big hand and saidThe two had just finished exchanging their feelings for each other, and their relationship has also been sublimated in the process. The relationship between the two has taken a step closer. Naturally, they want to be with the one they love all the time.In fact, Mu Chen is also reluctant to leave Mu Yan, even if it is only for a while, but he is worried that he will be tired, so he will let him stay on the swing to rest, but now that Mu Yan wants to be with him on his own initiative, he will naturally notSo, the two put the steamed buns on the steamer with sweet faces, and put the steamed buns into the basket. From the beginning to the end, there were thick pink bubbles between the two of them.Therefore, when the door of Mu\u2019s house was opened, all the customers who were looking forward to it realized that the two young bosses were unusual today, and they were caught off guard by dog food all over their faces.Number Five: Hehe, stupid human beings!\u201cThere are not many buns today, first come, first served.\u201d Mu Chen was in a very good mood, even when facing these customers, he still had some faint smiles on his face.The customers were initially a little overwhelmed by Mu Chen\u2019s smile, but when they heard that there were not many buns, they immediately became overwhelmed and hurriedly opened their mouths.\u201cGive me ten buns.\u201d\u201cLeave ten buns for me, my wife and children haven\u2019t eaten yet\u201cGive me twenty buns.\u201d\u201cBuy less for the ones in front of Nima, and buy more for the ones in the back.\u201dThe scene was like a vegetable market, a mess. If it was in the past, even if Mu Chen didn\u2019t get angry, he should have released his air-conditioning. But today, from the beginning to the end, he laughed with incomparable patience. The customers who saw it couldn\u2019t help but feel hairy.\u201cThe big boss seems to be in a good mood today?\u201d Someone couldn\u2019t help but said something tentatively.\u201cWell, it\u2019s very good.\u201d Mu Chen nodded and replied with a smile.Customers: Z(\u00b0\u25b3.\u4e28|\u4e28)\u4e28The cold-faced Hades actually smiled,Also, I also answered, does the sun come out from the west?\u201cIs there any happy event?\u201d Another person asked tentatively.Unexpectedly, Mu Chen actually replied again, \u201cWell, Mu Mu confessed his love to me.\u201dCustomers: \u2026Unexpectedly, he was shown a face of affection, and was smeared with a mouthful of dog food. What the hell?Huh? Obviously they have never heard of dog food, and they don\u2019t know what it is, why did this word suddenly appear in their minds?\u201cOkay, the buns are all sold out, if you haven\u2019t bought any, please come early tomorrow.\u201d Mu Chen said patiently, and then walked in with his little lover in his arms, leaving behind a crowd of blinded customers.\u201cThe big boss has been laughing all the time today, I feel like I\u2019m hallucinating.\u201d\u201cI saw it too, did I have hallucinations too?\u201d\u201cTsk tsk tsk tsk\u2026 The little boss is really amazing, but he just confessed his confession, and turned the cold-faced big boss into this.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t expect the big boss to be such a big boss.\u201d\u201cHmph, those who show affection are really the most annoying, especially those who show affection in front of single dogs, they should all be burned to death!\u201d\u201cBut the big boss is really handsome and handsome, especially when he smiles, it\u2019s simply fascinating.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Everyone was discussing in a hurry, but it didn\u2019t affect Mu Chen\u2019s mood at all. He felt that his good mood could last for several days.In the afternoon, the two of them went to the forest to find food as usual, but this time because Mu Yan bound Mu Chen as a partner, the other party also knew the existence of the system, so there was no need to hide the food this time. It is also much more convenient.Mu Yan also released the Jade Snake that he contracted before, after all, this little thing is much more professional in finding ingredients than they are.Mu Chen stared at the little snake that appeared out of thin air, and was a little taken aback, but soon returned to normal, and some things that happened before were explained.\u201cAh Chen, this is the Jade Snake. No. 5 said it is an expert at finding ingredients. As long as the contract is signed, it can listen to us.\u201d Mu Yan took the initiative to explain to Mu Chen.Mu Chen was pleased by Mu Yan\u2019s \u201cwe\u201d, and he was in a good moodNo. 5 has been flying above the two of them, watching them communicate below, feeling very dissatisfied, of course, this dissatisfaction is mainly aimed at Mu Chen.In the past, when it accompanied the little host to the forest, the little host communicated with it, but since Mu Chen was born, it has fallen out of favor, lost, loved, lost!After the little host binds Mu Chen as a partner, it becomes completely transparent. Is there a more tragic system than it? No!The jasper snake seemed to have been held back for a long time, and the moment it was released, it immediately disappeared without a trace, but no one was worried about it. After all, no matter how far away the pet was contracted, the owner could It\u2019s there, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it getting lost.When they came out this time, Mu Chen and Mu Yan were obviously more relaxed than before, probably because of the existence of Jasper Snake.As expected, the jasper snake did not disappoint its owner, nor did it live up to its title of \u201clittle expert in finding ingredients\u201d. After a while, it jumped out of a tuft of grass, circled around Mu Yan a few times, and then walked along the wood. Yan\u2019s trousers began to climb all the way up, as if he wanted to climb to Mu Yan\u2019s wrist, but he was stopped by a big hand halfway.\u201cHiss\u2026\u201d The Jasper Snake looked curiously at the person who blocked it. When he saw it, he screamed louder and more miserable, and his body twisted crazily, obviously remembering the first time he was caught. Time for fear.\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d Mu Chen said coldly, but the jasper snake really didn\u2019t move anymore, maintaining the weird twisting posture before, and froze in Mu Chen\u2019s hand motionless.Number Five: ..\u201cIt\u2019s really worthless, you can\u2019t move if you don\u2019t move, it\u2019s too embarrassing\u2026\u201d No. 5 muttered softly.Jasper Snake: /(TOT) Guang~ Is it my fault, is it my fault, can this be my fault? This person is terrible, why does the little master have such a terrible companion, then will I still have a living head in the future.\u201cDid Xiaolu find anything? Did you find other ingredients?\u201d Mu Yan didn\u2019t notice the dark turbulence between Jasper Snake and Mu Chen, but the excitement when Jasper Snake came back.Because of the existence of the contractual relationship, Mu Yan was able to sense Jasper Snake\u2019s emotions to a certain extent.Jasper Snake only dared to move its eyeballs now, it first looked at the little master, then looked at Mu Chen, wondering if it should respond to the little master\u201cHuh? What\u2019s wrong with Xiaolu?\u201d Mu Yan noticed the strange shape of the Jasper Snake and was puzzled.\u201cProbably because I was too excited to find the ingredients.\u201d Mu Chen said without blushing, and then naturally put the jasper snake on the ground.The jasper snake finally breathed a sigh of relief, but it didn\u2019t dare to climb onto the little master\u2019s body privately, so it could only circle around on the ground and scream at the little master.Xiaolu: Master, I found something delicious. It\u2019s delicious. Come with me quickly.After turning around a few times, the jade snake began to slide in one direction. \u201cLittle Green must have found something delicious, let\u2019s hurry up.\u201d Number Five said, finally being able to insert a sentence, he was so excited that he wanted to cry and swell?The two began to follow a snake systematically, through thick grass, around tall trees, and then came to a low bush.There are bunches of bright red berries hanging on the bushes. They look a bit similar to the grapes from the previous life. They are about the size of a grape, but the color is extremely bright. Did not dare to pick it up.The jasper snake has been circling these bushes in circles, apparently the ingredients it found are these bright red berries.Mu Yan threw the identification technique on it, and then heard the system\u2019s icy voice: \u201cSweet and sour fruit, sour or sweet, edible.\u201dMu Chen also heard this voice, and it was the first time he heard this voice, but he didn\u2019t show much surprise, probably because he had been surprised by the system before, so he had a certain ability to accept the system\u2019s functions.\u201cAh Chen, this thing is edible, it should be a kind of fruit.\u201d Mu Yan looked at Mu Chen and said excitedly, this is the first time he found fruit.Mu Chen stepped forward to pick one off, tasted it, the taste was indeed sweet and sour as the system said, it was delicious, even better than flavored nutritional supplementsSo he took off another one, wiped it carefully, and then handed it to Mu Yan\u2019s mouth.Mu Yan opened his mouth and took a bite, the sweet and sour feeling immediately filled his mouth, making people want to eat it even more.As if he had \u201cheard\u201d Mu Yan\u2019s thoughts, Mu Chen took another one, handed it to Mu Yan\u2019s mouth, fed five or six in a row, and then stopped.\u201cThis thing should not be eaten too much, let\u2019s pick some back.\u201d Mu Chen said, and began to pick.There seemed to be a lot of sweet and sour fruits on the bushes, but not many were picked, only half of the basket was filled.When everyone was picking the sweet and sour fruit, the jasper snake had already disappeared, and I\u2019m afraid they were looking for other ingredients.With the joining of Jasper Snake, it is much more efficient for everyone to find ingredients.Everyone gained a lot from this trip to the forest, especially when the Jasper Snake gave Mu Yan a big surprise when he was about to leave the forest at the end.happiness.Because, Mu Yan found wheat, although the amount of wheat that can be made into flour is not much, but this is definitely a big surprise, compared to all the ingredients found before, it is more fun.\u201cAh Chen, it\u2019s great that we found wheat, so we can have flour in the future, and the task can be completed faster.\u201d Mu Yan excitedly hugged Mu Chen\u2019s arm and jumped, his joy was beyond words.Mu Chen looked at Mu Yan indulgently, with a faint smile on his face. No. 5 was obviously very happy, \u201cYanyan, let\u2019s go back and grind it into flour. I don\u2019t know what the taste of buns wrapped in flour is. Will it taste better than nutrition powder?\u201dIt has to be said that the focus of foodies will never be the same as that of others.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Mu Yan looked at the small piece of wheat in front of him. Although it looked like a lot, it was far from enough for them.\u201cIt\u2019s getting late, let\u2019s go back first, I\u2019ll come over to harvest the wheat tomorrow.\u201d Mu Chen interrupted No. 5 and said.Everyone, look at the time, it\u2019s really getting late, if you go to harvest the wheat now, I\u2019m afraid it will be evening when you go back, and this place will be much more dangerous.\u201cOkay then.\u201d Although No. 5 wanted to eat steamed buns made of flour quickly, he also knew that it was not advisable to stay outside for a long time at night.So, a group of people carried today\u2019s harvest on their backs and walked on the way homeMu Yan\u2019s mood could not be calm for a long time. After searching for so long, he finally found a staple food ingredient. Although the quantity is not much, he still has his own land. He can use those wheat as seeds and plant them, so that when the harvest comes , you can harvest several times more than ten times more wheat than now, and then you can use flour to make food.Thinking of this, Mu Yan felt impatient.Until going to sleep, Mu Yan was still in a state of high spirits because of finding wheat, Mu Chen looked at Mu Yan like this, and couldn\u2019t laugh or cry.\u201cIf you don\u2019t sleep, you won\u2019t be able to wake up tomorrow.\u201d Mu Chen said, wrapping Mu Yan in his arms.\u201cI can\u2019t sleep.\u201d Mu Yan\u2019s voice was soft and his eyes were bright.\u201cThen\u2026do you want me to help you fall asleep faster?\u201d Mu Chen said in a bewitching voice, a trace of desire gradually filled the depths of his eyes.\u201cHow to do it?\u201d Mu Yan didn\u2019t realize the danger in a daze, instead he sent himself to the mouth of the big bad wolf.Mu Chen turned over and pressed Mu Yan against his body, blocking that seductive little mouth, and at the same time saw that big bright eyes suddenly widened, and the dumbfounded look really made people want to swallow them all at once.The movement in the room continued until the middle of the night, and Mu Yan, who was unable to sleep because of high emotions, couldn\u2019t even lift his eyelids because of his high emotion, and fell asleep deeply in Mu Chen\u2019s broad arms.\u201cGood night.\u201d Mu Chen\u2019s hoarse voice was full of pampering, embracing that soft and petite body, his heart was full and he was very happy.The next day, Mu Yan naturally \u201cstayed in bed\u201d again. When he woke up, it was already noon, not to mention making buns, and even selling them.Thinking of what Mu Chen did with him last night, Mu Yan\u2019s little face turned red again. Even though he had done such intimate things more than once, Mu Yan still felt shy and embarrassed to see people every time. .No. 5 looked at Mu Chen who was clearing away the after-sales table and steamer, looked at the bedroom door which was still closed, and sighed deeply.The only advantage of binding Mu Chen as a system partner is probably\u2026 the system upgrade task can continue.Ugh\u2026After lunch at noon, after Mu Chen made sure that Mu Yan didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable, the two went to the place where the wheat was found yesterday, ready to harvest.\u201cNo. 5, do you have a sickle?\u201d Mu Yan looked at Maizi and asked. number five..\u201cOur system points are still negative.\u201d No. 5 said with difficulty. If this continues, when will they become positive. wooden words\u2026Mu Chen has also heard about the points in the system, and he also has a little understanding of the fact that the points are always below the horizontal line. He knows that his little lover still owes a lot of points.Mu Chen stepped forward to observe the wheat carefully. It was the first time he had seen such a plant, so he didn\u2019t know whether the place where the wheat could be eaten was the stem, the top, or the root. After all, among the ingredients they found before, these There is something to eat everywhere.Under uncertain circumstances, Mu Chen directly uprooted the wheat, and found that it was easy to do so, so he grabbed several wheat with one hand, and with a little force, they all came out of the soil.While Mu Yan and No. 5 were still discussing whether to exchange the sickle, Mu Chen had harvested nearly half of the wheat by himself.No. 5: Z(\u00b0\u25b3.\u4e28\u4e28|)|Wooden words: \u3007((*v*))\u3007\u201cAh Chen, you are amazing, did you collect all these?\u201d Mu Yan looked at the wheat lying neatly on the ground, and said adoringly.He was still worrying about not having a sickle, but Ah Chen had already harvested so much with his bare hands, which is really amazing.Number Five: Fall! Then what\u2019s the point of their discussion just now! what sense!\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know which parts are edible, so I pulled them all up, come and see, is this okay?\u201d Mu Chen enjoyed Mu Yan\u2019s admiration very much, which made him feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. Take a risk.\u201cWheat is eaten from the ears of wheat. At that time, it still needs to be husked and beaten into flour.\u201d Mu Yan explained to Mu Chen. Although he didn\u2019t know how to hustle, the system should know.Mu Yan pulled Mu Chen\u2019s big hands, looked at those hands carefully, and found no scars on them, so he breathed a sigh of relief.Since Mu Chen can harvest so much with bare hands, they don\u2019t need a sickle. Perhaps the wheat in this world is easier to harvest than in theirs.Mu Yan also followed Mu Chen\u2019s example, grabbing a few stalks of wheat, intending to pull them out, hard\u2026 and more hard\u2026 but the wheat was not at all intact.move.Number Five: ..\u201cI think it\u2019s quite simple for Mu Chen to do it.\u201d No. 5 murmured.Muyan\u2026Mu Yan felt that he might have used too little force, so he used more force. As a result, the wheat was still firmly rooted in the ground, but the friction between the wheat stalk and Mu Yan\u2019s hand was less than the force he used, and the palm directly Slid up along the straw.The rough straw kept rubbing against the palm of his hand, and there was a burning pain. Mu Yan even fell to the ground because of too much force.\u201cMu Mu.\u201d When Mu Chen saw Mu Yan fall, he immediately dropped the wheat in his hand, quickly came to Mu Yan\u2019s side, helped him up, and then saw the palm that had been worn out and even oozing blood, Immediately, I felt distressed and tugged.\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d Mu Chen held Mu Yan\u2019s palm carefully, not daring to use force, lest Mu Yan would hurt if he got older, and at the same time secretly annoyedIf he knew that this would hurt Mumu, he would definitely speed up and harvest all the wheat before Mumu found out.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d Mu Yan said with a smile, trying to make Mu Chenrest assured.There were just a few scratches on the palm of his hand, some red marks and some blood oozing, this is not a big deal to Mu Yan, after all, in his previous life, he was injured more than now, and suffered more than he did now. Seriously now, he\u2019s used to it.But Mu Yan is used to it, which doesn\u2019t mean Mu Chen is also used to it. He suddenly picked up Mu Yan and carefully led him to the edge of the wheat field. The previous wound medicine was carefully applied to him and gently blown in an attempt to relieve his pain.The cool wind was very comfortable on the wound, but it also made Mu Yan\u2019s little face blush.Mu Chen would carry the wound medicine with him, just in case he was injured in the forest, he didn\u2019t expect that the first person to use it would be Mu Yan.Feeling Mu Chen\u2019s careful care and treatment, Mu Yan felt his heart swell, and his eyes were a little moist.No one has ever treated him so well, and no one has ever cared whether he is injured or in pain. His so-called family members will only keep squeezing him, enslaving him, and wishing he could do all the work. For the first time, Yan felt the feeling of being carefully cared for.The person in front of him is his partner, a partner that only belongs to him, that\u2019s great!\u201cAchen, thank you.\u201d Mu Yan said sincerely.Thank you for giving me a complete family, thank you for being so kind to me, thank you for being with me all the time, thank you\u2026Mu Yan\u2019s big eyes were moist, but there was a happy smile on his face, very bright. When Mu Chen raised his head, he saw exactly this kind of Mu Yan. Against the background of the sun, he looked so beautiful. Beautiful, such a dream.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be polite to me.\u201d Mu Chen touched Mu Yan\u2019s small head, and said gently, \u201cYou sit here, I will finish it soon.\u201d He also knew that his own strength was still relatively small in this world, and he obviously saw how easy it was for Ah Chen to pull it out, but when it came to him, he couldn\u2019t even pull it out.Alas\u2026 When you have points in the future, you still have to exchange them for a scythe as soon as possible, Mu Yan thought in his heart.In almost a few thoughts, Mu Chen had already harvested all the wheat, and tied it into bundles without a teacher, but\u2026\u201cHow to transport this back?\u201d Mu Yan asked in distress.I was so excited because I finally found the wheat, but I forgot to bring it back.\u201cIsn\u2019t that kind of delivery truck here too?\u201d Five said.\u201cBut the roads in the forest are difficult to walk, and cars can\u2019t drive in.\u201d Mu Yan replied.\u201cHmm\u2026 so what should I do?\u201d No. 5\u2019s face wrinkled into a ball. \u201cIt would be great if there was an ox cart.\u201d Mu Yan thought of the ox cart used to transport grain in the village in his previous life. If there was an ox cart, he could transport all the wheat back at once.\u201cThere is no one farming here, let alone raising cattle, where can I find a cart.\u201d Number Five said sadly.\u201cAlas\u2026\u201d Number Five and Mu Yan sighed deeply at the same time, apparently very conflicted.Mu Chen looked at the entangled one person, one system, couldn\u2019t help feeling amused, and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.Although there is a lot of wheat, it is not impossible for him to transport it back. After all, people in this world are quite strong in physical fitness and strong in strength, so as long as they can tie up all the wheat, he can drag it back. Going back is not out of the question.Mu Chen saw that Mu Yan and No. 5 were still worrying about how to transport the wheat, smiled, and didn\u2019t bother them, but went around to find two thick and long wooden sticks, and then found some rattan, Two wooden sticks are interspersed in the middle to form a simple bracket.Mu Chen had also heard before that Mu Yan relied on this simple support to drag himself back to the village step by step.He often thinks, Mu Yan\u2019s small stature, thin body, and lack of strength, how much courage and perseverance he possesses, he can persevere and drag him back to the village. He must have suffered a lot along the way. Bar.It is precisely because of this that he admires and cares for Mu Yan even more. For such a kind and beautiful person, no one is willing to let him suffer a little bit of injury.After making a simple bracket, Mu Chen tied all the wheat together and placed it on the bracket, which looked like a hill from a distance.In fact, Mu Chen can also directly drag the wheat away, but he is worried that it will damage the ears of wheat, and Mu Mu will definitely feel distressed at that time.Therefore, he would rather trouble himself and make an extra bracket.\u201cMu Mu, we\u2019re going back.\u201d Mu Chen said to Mu Yan, and then put the rope on his shoulders.Mu Yan turned his head when he heard the sound, and was instantly surprised by the hill-like pile of wheat.\u201cMy God, how did you do it?\u201d Number Five exclaimed in amazement, and then flew back and forth around the wheat pile several times, amazed as he flew.It seems that this man is not useless, at least he is quite strong, and he will come in handy for any bulky things in the future, No. 5 thought silently in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 - thresherPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cAh Chen, you are amazing, but there are so many wheats, you will get tired if you pull them, let\u2019s transport a little bit back first, and we\u2019ll get the rest next time.\u201cMu Yan looked at the rope on Mu Chen\u2019s shoulder and said distressedly.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, this is nothing to me, it will be dark if I don\u2019t go back.\u201d Mu Chen said to Mu Yan with a smile.Mu Yan looked at the sky, looked at the wheat pile, and then walked to Mu Chen\u2019s side, obviously wanting to help him share some.Mu Chen was not willing to let his little lover suffer, so he hurriedly stood aside so that he could not get the rope, and then said: \u201cI am strong, so it\u2019s okay to pull these, but you will get hurt.\u201dMu Yan remembered what he had just plucked the wheat, and was immediately discouraged.\u201cHey, let\u2019s go back.\u201d Mu Chen stretched out his hand to stroke Mu Yan\u2019s hair, and said dotingly.The two of them started to walk back one by one, No. 5 was still flying over the wheat pile in amazement, Mu Yan was always by Mu Chen\u2019s side, talking with him, asking from time to time if he was tired or if he wanted to rest.But seeing that Mu Chen\u2019s expression remained the same, and he didn\u2019t seem to be struggling, Mu Yan felt a little relieved and was very proud.This is a guy from his family. He is strong and powerful, and he can\u2019t make anything that tastes like that. As time goes by, everyone will stop tossing about it. Instead, they look forward to Muyan selling more steamed stuffed buns and scallion pancakes.of.\u201cIt\u2019s edible. When will Ah Yan make it and sell it? I\u2014definitely ask my family to buy more.\u201d Aunt Liu said with a smile.\u201cThe quantity is not much now, when there are more, I will definitely make some for you to try.\u201d Mu Yan replied with a smile.Mu Yan is handsome and cute, and well-behaved. He is still very popular in the village, especially those middle-aged aunts who always see Mu Yan overflowing with maternal love.\u201cOkay, okay, then Aunt Liu will wait for Ah Yan to cook something delicious.\u201cAunt Liu laughed and finished, and she staggered away from Mu Yan.Along the way, I met several villagers who were as enthusiastic as Aunt Liu. Of course, I occasionally encountered yin and yang, but usually they would block Mu Chen\u2019s face and dare not be too blatant, so Mu Yan never noticed their thoughts. , still warmly greeted them, but they were so angry that there was nothing they could do.After returning home, how to thresh the wheat became a difficult problem again. Mu Yan looked straight at No. 5, with a look of anticipation in his eyes. Number Five: ..No. 5 couldn\u2019t help holding his forehead, and wailed: \u201cIf this continues, when will we be able to pay off the points?\u201dYou know, it costs five times more to buy things with points borrowed from debts than normal points, five times! Thinking about it makes me feel distressed. If they didn\u2019t owe debts in the first place, not only would they be able to buy threshers, but they would also have leftovers!\u201cHmm\u2026how about we wait? Anyway, the wheat will be reserved for seed, and it\u2019s not the season for wheat planting. Let\u2019s exchange it when we have points.\u201d Mu Yan said cautiously.\u201cWhat? Save the seeds? Isn\u2019t it going to be made into flour?\u201d No. 5 listened, and instantly changed from the crazy state just now to another crazy state.\u201cThese wheat is too little. If it is used as flour, we can\u2019t make much. But if we save the seeds, we can plant them, and then we can harvest many times more wheat than this. And if we find wheat later , I will make flour for you.\u201d Mu Yan said firmly, he had already made a decision when he saw the wheatNo. 5 suddenly had nothing to love.This world is very different from the world Mu Yan lived in in his previous life, but the weather and seasons are similar, and there are also changes in the four seasons.It\u2019s the end of spring and the beginning of summer, which happens to be the season for winter wheat to mature and harvest. It can also be considered the season for planting spring wheat. However, they don\u2019t have a threshing machine now, so they can\u2019t get wheat seeds, so they can only plant winter wheat in late autumn and early winter. .Mu Yan tried his best not to think about planting, and let himself focus on selling buns, doing tasks, and upgrading the system, but he didn\u2019t know that all the things he was thinking just now were received by No. 5.Number Five: .Although the exchange points for the threshing machine are not low, if you sow the seeds now, you should be able to harvest in the fall. By then, you can get dozens of seeds for one seed, and the doubling ratio is quite high.Then in autumn, it will be able to eat food made from flour. At that time, the task will be done faster, and the upgrade will be faster, and the upgrade points will naturally come in a lot.Thinking about it now, it seems more cost-effective.No. 5 mentally compared the harvests that can be obtained from the two methods of sowing now and sowing in late autumn and early winter, and found that sowing now is more beneficial, so without further ado, he immediately exchanged for the simplest threshing machine from the system .Looking at the smaller numbers in the column of points, No. 5 felt his heart ache and became numb.\u201cNumber five?\u201d Mu Yan looked at the machine that appeared out of nowhere, and couldn\u2019t react.\u201cThis is the most primitive and simple threshing machine. It needs manual operation, so it doesn\u2019t need many points. We really can\u2019t afford luxury now, so we can only use this.\u201d Number Five explained.This is the first time for Mu Chen to experience the power of the system, and those dark eagle eyes became deeper, and the light in them flashed by.When Mu Yan heard this, he immediately became excited. He didn\u2019t mind that this was the simplest threshing machine. You must know that it was much more advanced than what they used in the village in their previous life.Originally, in Mu Yan\u2019s impression, he thought that the threshing machine was only the one used in their previous life village.Mu Yan touched the threshing machine left and right, and asked No. 5: \u201cHow do I use this?\u201d\u201cConnect it to the electricity, then hold a small bundle of wheat in your hand, and bring the end with the ears of wheat close to the direction of the turn, and then the ears of wheat will fall off automatically.\u201d No. 5 explained to Mu Yan Muchen in detail, after all This still needs the two of them to complete.\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Yan was a little eager to try.Mu Chen immediately found a power strip, and then connected the electricity to the yard, and the two decided to thresh in the yard.Although everyone in the village knew that Mu Yan would find something edible to come back from time to time, it\u2019s better not to be too high-profile, after all, the tree attracts the wind.Both Mu Chen and Mu Yan used the threshing machine for the first time, although No. 5 knew a little bit about it, but he was half-baked, so they were not very proficient in using it at first.However, Mu Chen\u2019s learning ability is still very strong, he quickly found the trick, and became more proficient in using it.\u201cMu Mu, take less each time, and let the ears of wheat close to you like me, and turn your head. Be careful, don\u2019t touch the machine.\u201d Mu Chen quickly threshed the wheat, while being distracted Pay attention to Mu Yan, and be careful that he gets hurt.Fortunately, Mujia lived on the edge of the village, otherwise, the sound of the machine would definitely attract all the neighbors around.Although Mu Chen was the main force for threshing, Mu Yan\u2019s efficiency was not high, but they didn\u2019t harvest much wheat, so they finished it all very quickly. By this time, it was already dark.\u201cI\u2019m working on the rest tomorrow, you go to the house to rest first, and I\u2019ll make you dinner.\u201d Mu Chen said to Mu Yan.\u201cAh Chen, you worked the most today, you go to rest, I\u2019ll make dinner.\u201d Mu Yan held Mu Chen\u2019s arm and said with his head raised.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Mu Chen stretched out his hand to rub the other party\u2019s hair, and said with a smile.\u201cNo, you have to rest.\u201d Mu Yan said persistently, and then pulled Mu Chen to walk towards the room.Mu Chen had no choice but to obediently go to the room to rest, while Mu Yan went to the kitchen, made a few simple dishes, reheated some steamed buns, and had a delicious dinner with Mu Chen.The next morning, Mu Yan and Mu Chen woke up early. After all, the wheat has been threshed, but it still needs to be cleaned and dried before it can be used as seeds.The weather was fine, with plenty of sunshine and a bit of wind, just right for cleaning and drying.As for the experience of sun-drying millet, I have seen others do it in the previous life, and Mu Yan is not very familiar with it, but it is enough to deal with the current situation.Mu Yan found a slender wooden plank, because there is no special lifting tool here, so he can only use a wooden plank instead, scoop up some grains mixed with impurities, and throw them lightly, and those tiny impurities will be removed with the help of the wind. The next breaks away from the fallen grains.Repeated lifting and cleaning in this way will make the fallen grains much cleaner and less impurities.\u201cLet me make it, you go make the buns.\u201d Mu Chen stepped forward, took the wooden board from Mu Yan\u2019s hand, and replaced him to do the work.Mu Yan didn\u2019t compete with him either. After all, the steamed stuffed buns would continue to be sold at noon. It was the best way for them to work together.The progress bar of the task is almost at the end, which means that after selling buns a few more times, you may be able to upgrade. Thinking of getting another recipe after the upgrade, Mu Yan feels very happy. I don\u2019t know what the next recipe will be Woolen cloth?In the yard, Mu Chen was cleaning the grains, in the kitchen, Mu Yan was seriously wrapping the buns, and No. 5 was circling around in the air boredly, no one disturbed anyone, and there was no communication, but It looks unusually harmonious and warm.The Mu family\u2019s yard is spacious enough, so the wheat after cleaning is directly dried in the yard.\u2014\u2014After three days in the sun, the wheat seeds have become relatively dry, and the sound of the wheat grains is crisp when you use your teeth. At this time, the moisture in the wheat seeds has also decreased a lot, and they can be directly collected and used for sowing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 - Mu Chen is jealousPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMu Yan put away the wheat seeds, and then concentrated on doing the upgrade task. There is only a little bit left for the upgrade task. As long as there is one more time, it should be able to upgrade.\u201cDing, the system has been upgraded to the third level, and the reward recipe is a tofu nao, a plaster tofu, and a chance to draw a lottery.\u201d The system\u2019s cold voice sounded, and Mu Yan, who was selling steamed buns, instantly evoked a bright smile, facing the customer Sometimes more patient.The customers who were queuing were stunned when they saw the smile on Mu Yan\u2019s face.They had always known that the little boss was very handsome, but they didn\u2019t expect that this smile turned out to be so good-looking, as if the flowers were blooming, making people feel better unconsciously.Mu Chen obviously also noticed the changes in the customers, his already expressionless face turned darker, then he took over the work in Mu Yan\u2019s hands, pushed the people into the door, and said: \u201cYou go back to rest first, and you will be back soon.\u201d Will be sold out.\u201dAlthough Mu Yan didn\u2019t know why Mu Chen suddenly asked him to rest, but he thought that there were not many buns left, and he would not be selling buns for the time being, so he didn\u2019t stop him, but before the other party left, he still quietly followed him. Said: \u201cThe system upgrade task is completed, we will not sell buns for the time being, I want to plant wheat first, you will tell the customers later, so that they don\u2019t come to queue tomorrow.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Mu Chen nodded, and then closed the door under the watchful eyes of all the customers, completely blocking Mu Yan from the sight of the outside world.Everyone: \u2026Why does it feel like the surrounding area has suddenly cooled down?It wasn\u2019t until the last steamed stuffed bun was sold out that Mu Chen announced slowly, \u201cStarting tomorrow, steamed stuffed buns won\u2019t be sold anymore.\u201dThere were only nine short words without any explanation, and the customers who were queuing up were stunned in an instant.\u201cWhat do you mean? It won\u2019t be sold tomorrow?\u201d\u201cBig boss, why don\u2019t you sell it tomorrow?\u201d\u201cI was still thinking about selling more tomorrow. If I had known earlier, I would have bought more today.\u201d\u201cNo way, big boss, if you don\u2019t sell it anymore, what shall we eat?\u201dImmediately, there were complaints everywhere, if Mu Yan was here, maybe they would be said to be soft-hearted, but they were facing Mu Chen with a paralyzed and cold face, and they were not moved at all.No matter what the customers said or how much they cried, Mu Chen still packed his things calmly, and then closed the door with a \u201cbang\u201d in front of everyone.Everyone: \u2026 A life without buns is nothing to love!No matter how the customers reacted to the news that the steamed buns were no longer for sale, Mu Yan\u2019s plan was still proceeding steadily.\u201cYanyan, quickly draw the lottery and see what you can get?\u201d After learning about the system upgrade, No. 5 couldn\u2019t wait to find Muyan and saidThey need too many tools now, if you are lucky, maybe the lottery can solve some of them^Mu Yan was obviously very excited, the system has now been upgraded to level three, not only has one more chance to draw a lottery, but also gave two recipes, recipes are the most important thing to Mu Yan.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can get a farming tool.\u201d No. 5 murmured to himself.Mu Yan, who was about to open the recipe, suddenly stopped after hearing this.That\u2019s right, they\u2019re going to start farming soon, but the fields that belong to him haven\u2019t been plowed yet. What they need most now are probably the tools for plowing the land.\u2014\u2014Thinking of this, Mu Yan is not in a hurry to read the recipes. Anyway, he has to wait until the wheat is planted before he can think about the next upgrade task.Looking at the lottery draw button on the panel, Mu Yan suddenly couldn\u2019t press it any longer. What if he didn\u2019t get something very good? His luck has always been bad, and all his good luck was used up when he met Ah Chen.\u201cYanyan, hurry up.\u201d Number Five urged.\u201cAh Chen, you come to draw the lottery.\u201d Mu Yan said to Mu Chen who was hugging him behind him, he really didn\u2019t have confidence in himself.\u201cHuh?\u201d Mu Chen looked at the system panel with Mu Yan, and asked, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cCould it be that you can get whatever Yanyan wants? Do you think the system belongs to your family?\u201d No. 5 couldn\u2019t hold back the sarcasm.Mu Chen glanced at No. 5 faintly, the contempt in his eyes was obvious.\u201cHmph, even if the system belongs to my family, I can\u2019t control it. Do you think you can?\u201d No. 5 said angrily. Don\u2019t think you just gave me a look, so I can\u2019t understand the meaning. It\u2019s smart.Mu Chen didn\u2019t pay attention to No. 5, but waited patiently for Mu Yan\u2019s answer.\u201cIt would be great if I can win the farm tool.\u201d Mu Yan said, and then Mu Chen immediately pressed the button for the lottery, and the screen began to scrollMu Yan and No. 5 stared closely at the lottery page, clenched their fists, obviously a little nervous.Mu Chen\u2019s gaze was always on Mu Yan\u2019s body, seeing his nervous and cute appearance, he couldn\u2019t help but leaned forward and kissed him.\u201cOh, come out soon, come out soon.\u201d Mu Yan said excitedlyroad.\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d Mu Chen\u2019s deep laughter sounded in Mu Yan\u2019s ears, like a subwoofer, bringing joyful tremors.Mu Yan blushed with embarrassment, but the next moment he saw the rewards on the lottery page, he immediately forgot about the embarrassment just now\u201cAh! Ah Chen, look quickly, look quickly!\u201d Mu Yan excitedly grabbed Mu Chen\u2019s collar, motioning him to look at the system page.Mu Chen looked over indulgently, smiled dotingly, and saw a large \u201cset of farming tools\u201d written on the lottery page.Mu Yan got his wish.\u201cAh Chen, you are really amazing, you really got the draw, it\u2019s great!\u201d Mu Yan didn\u2019t know how to express his inner excitement and joy, he hugged Mu Chen and kept talking.No. 5 pursed his lips, his pea-sized eyes were fixed on the lottery page, as if he wanted to see through the other party.\u201cHmph, it\u2019s just a coincidence, what\u2019s the big deal.\u201d Number five said arrogantly, but no one agreed with it, or reasoned with it.Mu Yan was still in excitement, and Mu Chen only had Mu Yan in his eyes, holding him carefully to prevent him from slipping down because of being too excited.\u201cAh Chen, you are really good, will you be the one to draw the lottery in the future?\u201d Mu Yan said with bright eyes.\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Chen replied with a smile.Five opened his mouth to say something, but finally closed itForget it, the great Master No. 5 has a lot, so don\u2019t care about it like him.Mu Yan couldn\u2019t wait to take out all the plowing tools he had just picked up, including the shovel for plowing the ground, the shovel for shoveling, the **** for weeding or loosening the shallow soil, and so on.\u201cIt\u2019s good, so we can go directly to dig the ground tomorrow, and we can plant it when the ground is dug up.\u201d Mu Yan happily shared his joy with Mu Chen.At night, Mu Yan was so excited that he couldn\u2019t sleep. He felt that since he came to this world and met Ah Chen, he had been very lucky.Almost all the wishes he dared not imagine in his previous life have come true hereMu Yan turned to face Ah Chen, looking at that heroic face, he couldn\u2019t help secretly rejoicing, as if he got something that many people wanted but couldn\u2019t get, and only he had it.\u201cHey, go to sleep.\u201d Mu Chen looked at Mu Yan helplessly and dotingly, and patted the other\u2019s back with his big hands, like putting a baby to sleep.\u201cAh Chen, I\u2019m so happy.\u201d Mu Yan took the initiative to stretch out his small hand, wrapped it around Mu Chen\u2019s neck, and said with a smile.\u201cI am also very happy.\u201d Mu Chen leaned forward and pressed a gentle kiss on Mu Yan\u2019s forehead.\u201cAh Chen, it\u2019s great to meet you.\u201d Mu Yan\u2019s small head couldn\u2019t help rubbing against Mu Chen\u2019s neck and chest, his tone and movements revealed full dependence.Mu Chen felt that his heart became soft, itchy, and melted in a mess.I reached out and hugged the little person in my arms even tighter, Mumu, meeting you is the greatest luck in my life.The two hugged each other, and the picture was so warm that anyone who saw it couldn\u2019t help but be moved.\u201cAchen, I still can\u2019t sleep. I\u2019m very excited when I think that I can go to plow the fields tomorrow.\u201d Mu Yan pondered for a while, but found that he still didn\u2019t feel sleepy at all.After all, tomorrow is going to do what he wanted to do most in his previous life. When he thinks of harvesting a field of wheat in autumn, his body becomes uncontrollably excited.Mu Chen helplessly looked at the shining eyes, Mu Yan, who didn\u2019t feel sleepy at all, suddenly rolled over and covered him.\u201cAh, Ah Chen, what are you going to do?\u201d Mu Yan\u2019s face suddenly turned red, a little shy, looking at Mu Chen expectantly.\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m going to do?\u201d Mu Chen suddenly approached Mu Yan, the two faced each other, the distance between them was no more than one centimeter, each other\u2019s breath fell on each other\u2019s face, softly, as if still A trace of bewitchment.Mu Yan shrank back instinctively, but he was lying on the bed, so he had no place to shrink, so he could only be imprisoned between Mu Chen\u2019s arms and the bed.\u201cI, I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Mu Yan said in a low voice, his face was red and hot with embarrassment, and the body that was in contact with the other party also trembled and became hot.\u201cThen let me tell you, okay?\u201d Mu Chen\u2019s voice was very soft, falling on his ears, as if he was saying the sweetest love words, completely bewitching the defenseless Mu Yan.Mu Yan nodded blankly, and then greeted intensive and gentle kisses on the forehead, eyes, bridge of the nose, cheeks, lips, and chin, one kiss after another kept falling, and the soft touch made Mu Yan feel the other party care and cherish.Mu Yan put his arms around Mu Chen\u2019s neck, responding jerky and immature to the other\u2019s kiss.Mu Chen\u2019s eyes became deep and dark, like a small black hole, deeply attracting those who looked into it, as if a storm was brewing.Mu Yan\u2019s response was like a powerful aphrodisiac to Mu Chen. It made him, who could control his tenderness, become much wilder in an instant, and the kiss became deeper and more violent. It\u2019s all over.I don\u2019t know how long it took before the movement in the room slowly stopped, leaving only the musk that filled the room. Outside the room, the night sky had already been dotted with countless star lights. It was quiet and quiet, and everything seemed so beautiful .\u201cHuh?\u201d There was a small moaning sound from the bed, and the person who was still asleep turned over, showing signs of waking up.Mu Yan rubbed his eyes and sat up, looking around, after the most confused period, the memory of last night quickly came back, and his little face blushed for a moment.But it was only for a short period of time. After all, the two are already husband and wife. They have done this kind of thing that only a husband and wife can do. They have done it many times. Now I can face it calmly after being shy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 - power disparityPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPutting on his clothes quickly, Mu Yan couldn\u2019t wait to go to his field in the forest.\u201cAchen, Achen, let\u2019s go to the forest quickly.\u201d Mu Yan said happily.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go after breakfast.\u201d Mu Chen pampered Mu Yan\u2019s little head, said with a smile, and at the same time put the prepared buns and soup in front of Mu Yan.Mu Yan ate quickly, the speed of eating was obviously faster than usual, Mu Chen couldn\u2019t laugh or cry.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the ground won\u2019t run away by itself, be careful of choking.\u201d Mu Chen\u2019s attention has been on Mu Yan, watching him all the time, lest he will be choked, and will choke at the right time. Pass each other a glass of water.\u201cI\u2019m full.\u201d Mu Yan wiped his mouth and said to Mu Chen.Mu Chen knew that he was impatient, so he just packed up the dishes and put them in the sink to soak, planning to wash them when he came back, and then walked towards the edge of the forest with one person and one system excitedly. go.This land was enclosed by Mu Yan after he came to this world. Unfortunately, there were no seeds and no tools to cultivate the land, so it had been abandoned all the time. Now it is finally usable.Mu Yan looked around and found no one else, so he asked No. 5 to take out all the farming tools from the system space.Mu Yan picked up the pickaxe and planned to dig the ground first. After all, the soil in the forest is quite hard, and the seeds cannot be planted without turning it.In the previous life, the wealthy families all used cattle to plow the land, but most of them were poor, so everyone chose to cultivate the land manually, that is, they just took the pickaxe and plowed the land bit by bit.Mu Yan raised his big **** and slammed into the ground, but he didn\u2019t expect that the ground would be harder than he imagined, leaving only a shallow trace, but not even a trace of soil turned over. .Mu Yan was dumbfounded.Mu Chen hastily snatched the **** from Mu Yan\u2019s hand, frowning tightly, God knows that his heart almost stopped beating just now.The shovel was lifted above Mu Yan\u2019s head. At that moment, Mu Chen saw it, and almost thought that Mu Yan would be brought down by the shovel just like this. You must know that if this continues, it is very likely that he will be injured. He was too shocked and didn\u2019t react for a while, which made Mu Yan make his first move.\u201cYou tell me what to do, I\u2019ll do it, such a dangerous thing, what if you get hurt?\u201d Mu Chen looked at Mu Yan disapprovingly.Mu Yan sticks out his tongue playfully in his heart, being pampered by Mu Chen like this, his personality seems to become more and more lively.\u201cThis is called a hoe, and it\u2019s used to turn the ground, just like I just went down, and then turned the ground up.\u201d Mu Yan said while gesticulating with his hands, but he didn\u2019t reject Mu Chen\u2019s kindness.He knew that Chen was worried about him, and at the same time he also realized that he might not be able to complete the work of digging the ground with his own strength, so he could only \u201clet\u201d Chen do it.Sure enough, there is a natural difference between brother and man in terms of physique. There are always many things that are inconvenient for brothers who do not have a man.It wasn\u2019t until this moment that Mu Yan realized why life in the village was so difficult for those brothers who didn\u2019t have a man at home.Following Mu Yan\u2019s instructions, Mu Chen began to dig the ground with the hoe, and when he went down, half of the head of the **** went deep into the ground. With a hard pull, the ground that was hard for Mu Yan was easily handled by Mu Chen. was turned over.Mu Yan opened his eyes wide, looking at Mu Chen brightly, his eyes were full of admiration and pride.\u201cAh Chen, that\u2019s great!\u201dFor Mu Chen, Mu Yan has never been stingy with praise and praise.And receiving the admiration and praise from his beloved made Mu Chen more energetic and able to work more smoothly and diligently.This is probably another difference between traditional men and modern men.Although interstellar men and women can also get married now, but because they are all men, they are the same in nature, and they all hope to become superiors. In any aspect, there will be people who want to compete to winwant.But Mu Yan is different, what he can\u2019t do, Mu Chen has done, not only will he not feel that he is useless, but he will be proud and proud of his own man, if a man dominates his brother in some way, brother She won\u2019t feel that her dignity has been hit, but will be very docile and obedient to her own man.It took less than an hour for Mu Chen to turn over all the land. It has to be said that the men in this world are stronger than the men in Mu Yan\u2019s world, and their work efficiency is also higher.Mu Yan looked at the overturned land and couldn\u2019t react for a while.According to his plan, it might take a day just to dig the ground, but he didn\u2019t expect that Mu Chen only took an hour, which couldn\u2019t be better.\u201cAh Chen, you are really amazing!\u201d Mu Yan hugged Mu Chen excitedly, offering his red lips as a reward.As for Mu Chen, he happily accepted the reward.Since Mu Chen is very good at plowing the land, the part of sowing that was originally scheduled for the next day can be brought forward to today.Fortunately, the dried seeds were placed in the system space of No. 5, otherwise I would have to go back and get them now, Mu Yan thought happily in his heart.Turning the land once was not enough, Mu Chen went to turn it again after a while, because it was turned over before, so this time it was more time-saving and labor-saving to turn it over, it only took half an hour to finish it.Mu Yan asked No. 5 to take out the seeds, and then tried hard to think about the things that everyone needed to pay attention to when planting wheat in the previous life, and then together with Mu Chen,Sow the wheat seeds into the ground.Looking at his achievements today, Mu Yan felt very proud.\u201cAchen, do you think we want to fence this land?\u201d Mu Yan looked at the land that almost merged with the forest, and suggested, he was worried that others would accidentally step on his land when entering the forest.\u201cYeah.\u201d Mu Chen nodded in response, he would unconditionally support whatever Mu Yan wanted to do.Together, the two of them went to the forest to find some thick branches, and then Mu Chen made them into stakes of similar length, and then found some vines, and wrapped them around the stakes, looking from a distance, it looked like a The fence covered with vines just encloses all the land drawn by Mu Yan.There is also a door in the middle of the tall fence that allows people to go in and out. In this way, if someone sees it later, they should not step on the wheat by mistake.Mu Yan was very satisfied with this fence, and the smile on his face never disappeared.\u201cYanyan, quickly fertilize the wheat, so that the wheat can germinate faster.\u201d Number Five also said excitedly.\u201cFertilization? But we don\u2019t have fertilizer.\u201d Mu Yan said, there is no fertilizer in this world, and he doesn\u2019t know how to do it.\u201cDid you forget the prize you got in the last lottery draw?\u201d No. 5 reminded.It was only then that Mu Yan remembered that he seemed to have drawn some kind of fertilizer last time, so he immediately opened the system panel and called up the backpack, and there was indeed a bag of fertilizer lying there alone.Mu Yan lightly took out the fertilizer, it was only a small bag the size of a palm, and his small face wrinkled suddenly, it was so small, it was not enough at allNo. 5 seemed to see what Mu Yan was thinking, and explained: \u201cDon\u2019t look at just this small bag, but it can make the plants in a 100-acre field grow rapidly.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d So powerful? Mu Yan maintained a dazed expression on his face.Affection.\u201cThis is a growth fertilizer produced by the system, and only a small amount is enough for each mu of land.\u201d No. 5 said proudly.Mu Yan obeyed, only poured out a little bit, and held it carefully, lest if one dropped, it would be wasted.The growth fertilizers produced by the system are small red particles, which look very crystal clear, not like fertilizers, but more like red crystals\u201cHow do I use this?\u201d Mu Yan asked No. 5 holding the fertilizer. \u201cYou just need to scatter these fertilizers in the center of the land, and it will take effect by itself.\u201d Number Five said, and then Mu Yan went to fertilize obediently.After doing this, the whole morning has passed.Originally, Mu Yan thought that it would take several days to finish planting the wheat, but he didn\u2019t expect that it only took half a day. This efficiency was definitely beyond his expectation.Suddenly everything was done, and Mu Yan didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201cYanyan, didn\u2019t you get two new recipes, take a look, take a look.\u201d No. 5 said impatiently.Because I was busy with farming, I temporarily forgot the recipe. Now that the farming has been initially completed, Number Five remembered it again.After being reminded by No. 5, Mu Yan hastily clicked on the recipe that has been upgraded to the third level. Looking at the completely unfamiliar words, Mu Yan remembered one thing he could do.Mu Yan handed the recipe to Mu Chen, and asked, \u201cAh Chen, can you understand it?\u201dMu Chen looked at the words written on the screen. He knew every word, but when combined, he didn\u2019t know what it meant. After all, he had no knowledge about ingredients and recipes before.Just as Mu Chen was about to shake his head, he heard No. 5 say: \u201cOh, Yanyan, if you want to learn how to read, I\u2019ll teach you. I have such a ready-made teacher here, why do you ask him?\u201d Well, he sure doesn\u2019t understand anything.\u201d\u201cYou want to learn to read?\u201d Mu Chen asked Mu Yan seriously, ignoring No. 5 who was chattering.\u201cWell, I can\u2019t read.\u201d Mu Yan lowered his head slightly and said embarrassedly.\u201cI\u2019ll teach you.\u201d Mu Chen touched Mu Yan\u2019s drooping head distressedly, and the pity in his eyes grew stronger.Although this planet is very backward, and even the most primitive way of teaching is used, every child of school age will be sent to school to study, even children in rural areas can study for free. This is a federal regulation. No matter how poor you are, you can\u2019t be poor in education.Therefore, there are very few illiterate people in this world, but Mu Chen knows Mu Yan\u2019s life experience, and knows that he came from another world. pregnancy.It is precisely because of this that he feels more pity and love for Mu Yan. It is such a backward place that the children can\u2019t even afford to go to school.\u201cOkay.\u201d Hearing this, Mu Yan raised his head in surprise, looking at Mu Chen with bright eyes.No. 5 curled her lips in dissatisfaction, and said, \u201cYanyan, obviously I can teach you too.\u201dUnfortunately, at this time, no one paid any attention to it.Number Five: Life is really lonely like snow\u2026\u201cAh Chen, what are these two recipes written on?\u201d Mu Yan asked impatiently.\u201cTofu, ingredients: soybeans, gypsum, water\u2026 soak soybeans in water first\u2026\u201d \u201cTofu brain, ingredients: soybeans, soy sauce, pepper, inner fat\u2026the first step is to soak soybeans\u2026\u201dMu Chen read the words on the recipe in a deep and pleasant voice, and read to Mu Yan word for word.\u201cWe need soybeans, but we haven\u2019t found soybeans yet.\u201cAfter hearing this, Mu Yan couldn\u2019t help saying.\u201cDing, release the three-level upgrade task, make five thousand pieces of tofu nao and five thousand catties of tofu.\u201d The system sound sounded at the right time, as if responding to Mu Yan\u2019s words.\u201cFive thousand copies? I\u2019ll go, the system tasks are getting more and more difficult.\u201d Number Five couldn\u2019t help but tut-tsk.Although it is a system elf and a part of the system, it is not in charge of the task release of the system. Its main task is to accompany the host to complete the task, and of course it also means supervision.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 - Pry the cornerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMu Yan was not surprised by the number given by the system. His attention was always on the soybeans, because they hadn\u2019t found the soybeans so far, and they had to find the soybeans before they could start this task.\u201cIt seems that we have to work hard and find the soybeans quickly.\u201d Mu Yan said energetically.The wheat has been planted, but the soybeans have not been found yet. Mu Yan and Mu Chen do not plan to spend all their time looking for soybeans in the forest. After all, who knows where the soybeans are and when they will be found.Therefore, both of them let the matter of finding soybeans go with the flow, and did what they usually had to do.Mu Yan and Mu Chen discussed it and decided to continue selling scallion pancakes and steamed buns, which are the two foods they are most proficient at making.Although making scallion pancakes and steamed stuffed buns can no longer be completed as a system task, points will still increase for each one made, and what Mu Yan and the others need most now are points.As before, it is only sold once a day in the morning, and in the afternoon, I will take Xiaolu to the forest to find ingredients.The customers in the village, after learning that the Mu family no longer sells buns, were all depressed every day. When they saw other customers, they looked at each other and sighed.However, after hearing that it was on sale again a day later, the previous gloomy atmosphere was swept away, and the gloomy atmosphere in the village disappeared without a trace in an instant, making those who had never bought it curious.Under the protection of these people, almost all the people in Taohua Village, including those who work outside, knew about Mu Yan and Mu Chen\u2019s making steamed buns, and many even asked for leave to come back and try it out to see if it was true. Delicious as advertised by family and friends.It\u2019s just that some people came here by accident, just when the Mu family announced that they would not sell it for the time being, they immediately complained and shouted it\u2019s a pity.But God still favored them. Just when those people\u2019s holidays were coming to an end, Mu Yan decided to sell again. Therefore, when the sales point opened again, the number of people queuing at the door was several times more than before. They couldn\u2019t help being taken aback.\u201cLittle boss, good morning, how many buns have you prepared this time?\u201cThe customers standing in the front row greeted with a smile.\u201cGood morning, yes, there are many.\u201d Mu Yan replied stiffly.\u201cHey\u2026 little boss, hurry up and serve the buns, we\u2019ve been waiting for several days, and I\u2019m almost starved to death.\u201d A villager said impatiently, and was echoed by many people.\u201cOkay, okay\u2026\u201d Mu Yan opened the door, and then went back to the yard to look at the buns.Without Muyan\u2019s knowledge, the customers began to discuss and reached an agreement. They decided that in order to attract customers to Muyan, and to give those who came for the first time a taste, everyone unanimously decided to buy at most three per person. buns.\u201cAlthough the three are not enough to plug the teeth, but for the sake of the little boss, bear it!\u201d\u201cHey\u2026I\u2019m smart, my wife and daughter are here, buy three for each person, and nine for three people.\u201d Someone couldn\u2019t help showing off.As soon as the man said that, it was as if a magical switch had been turned on. The other customers didn\u2019t even have time to complain about him. They tacitly took out their mobile phones and started calling their relatives or friends.Why didn\u2019t they think of this earlier, what a mistake, a mistake!Not long after, Mu Chen came out with a big steamer, and put the steamer on the table. Naturally, there were white, fat and cute buns on it.When the customers saw the steamed stuffed bun, their eyes lit up suddenly, as if they saw some treasure, they couldn\u2019t help swallowing secretly.However, as if the excitement wasn\u2019t enough, Mu Yan immediately brought out a wooden basket, which contained sliced scallion pancakes. The scent of scallions and oil mixed together and emanated, constantly seducing the stomachs of everyone present. glutton.\u201cBoss, there are scallion pancakes for sale today. It\u2019s really great. This trip is really worth it.\u201d The sharp-eyed customer standing in the front row saw the scallion pancakes, and immediately felt elated and eager to move, planning to buy more scallions later. Oil cake back.\u201cWhat? And scallion pancakes? Are there any scallion pancakes today besides steamed stuffed buns?\u201d The customer standing behind who couldn\u2019t see the situation in front couldn\u2019t help shouting.\u201cHey, hey\u2026 buy less for the ones in the front, and save some for the ones in the back. This is what was agreed before, don\u2019t play tricks.\u201d The customer behind was scratching his head, wishing he could go up and grab it now.However, the customers in front of the queue collectively pretended to be deaf.What? What did you say? The wind is too strong, we can\u2019t hear clearly? We seem to have discussed the quantity of steamed stuffed buns just now, but we didn\u2019t discuss the amount of scallion pancakes. Those who don\u2019t buy more are definitely fools.So, when Mu Chen said that the sale would start, all the customers went crazy and couldn\u2019t wait to open their mouths, fearing that if it was a second late, all the scallion pancakes would be snatched up, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to eat them.The customers in the front are buying like crazy, and the customers in the back are even more crazy\u201cHey, hey\u2026you are not allowed to play tricks, save some for the later ones.\u201cOld Li, you are quite old, you still have to be shameless, how can you not count what you said.\u201dThe customers in the back kept shouting, but it\u2019s a pity that they couldn\u2019t hear them at all. It\u2019s a joke. If they really heard it, would they still have their share? Keeping the steamed stuffed buns for them would be considered as the utmost benevolence.As a result, the scallion pancakes were quickly sold out, but the steamed stuffed buns were sold very regularly.Those young people who specially asked for leave to buy steamed buns couldn\u2019t hide the shocked expressions on their faces when they ate the first bite. The other old customers who saw them laughed and were very proud, but they forgot when they first started, The expressions of these people are basically the same, okay?\u201cIsn\u2019t it delicious? Do you feel that all your life was wasted before, haha\u2026\u201dNew customer: TAT\u201cIt\u2019s delicious, but unfortunately I have to go back tomorrow, what should I do? I feel that I can\u2019t even take the nutritional supplements when I go back.\u201d The new customer said that he was very upset and melancholy, and he felt like \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back again\u201d. impulse.\u201cHaha, then stay here. Although we are only a small village, we have the most delicious buns in the world. I don\u2019t know how much happier we are than outside.\u201dNot to mention, some people were really moved by what was said, and even some young people with active minds rushed to Mu Yan and Mu Chen immediately, and said excitedly: \u201cLittle boss, have you thought about it?\u201d Open a shop in the city, with your craftsmanship, even if you only sell these two kinds, you can live comfortably in the city, and the population in the city is larger, so you must earn more.\u201dMu Yan and Mu Chen didn\u2019t say anything, but the villagers of Taohua Village who heard this were the first to quit.\u201cHey, hey, what do you mean, you have come to my Peach Blossom Village by prying the corner of the wall openly? You don\u2019t want to come here anymore, we don\u2019t welcome you in Peach Blossom Village, leave now!\u201d\u201cThe little boss and the big boss are both from our Taohua Village, so they will naturally stay here. If you just want to buy food, Taohua Village will welcome you, but if you have other purposes, you won\u2019t send them away.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, who are these people? It\u2019s really abominable to want to poach our boss away in an open and aboveboard manner.\u201d The women also whispered softly.The young man\u2019s face turned red and white, hot and hot, quite ashamed and angry.\u201cI, I am doing this for the benefit of the two bosses. Peach Blossom Village is just a village no matter how good it is, and there is too little room for development. The two bosses are so talented, so of course it is more suitable for a larger development space.\u201d The young man said with his neck stuck.\u201cYou also said, believe it or not, I will have someone throw you out right now!\u201d The villagers were angry. They were actually quite worried that Mu Yan and Mu Chen would be persuaded to leave Taohua Village.Others don\u2019t know, but they are clear that Mu Yan and Mu Chen don\u2019t belong to Taohua Village, but they were rescued by the villagers and lived in Taohua Village temporarily. They were persuaded and wanted to leave the village, but they had no position to stop them.The young man was frightened by the unity of the villagers, and he didn\u2019t care about persuading Mu Yan and Mu Chen, so he ran away in a hurry.\u201cIt\u2019s really unlucky. I thought I just came here to buy food. Who knew it would be like this.\u201d The villagers muttered dissatisfied.\u201cMu Yan Mu Chen, you are selling again, everyone is very happy, and will definitely come to buy more in the future\u2026 an older elder walked up to the two of them and said, but he hesitated to speak later, as if he was a little embarrassed to say it .Mu Yan didn\u2019t understand the subtext of these people, but Mu Chen did, and said, \u201cThis is our home.\u201dThe subtext is that even if we leave in the future, this is our forever home and we will come back.With Mu Chen\u2019s promise, the other villagers also breathed a sigh of relief, with sincere smiles on their faces, and they felt satisfied and happy that they could still eat delicious food in the future.\u201cThank you for your support today, I will be here at the same time tomorrow, and I will do more.\u201d Mu Chen said to everyone.Then, everyone left contentedly.In fact, neither Mu Chen nor Mu Yan thought about leaving Peach Blossom Village for the time being. After all, Mu Yan first came to this world and fell in the forest of Peach Blossom Village. After Mu Chen lost his memory, some of his first memories were also in Peach Blossom Village. The two met, fell in love and got married in Taohua Village, so this village has a very special meaning to them.What\u2019s more, the ingredients in the forest of Taohua Village have not been found yet, and they will not leave. After all, the ingredients in the forest are an important material for their survival and the basis for upgrading tasks.Probably, when the upgrade task requires more weight, and when the ingredients in the forest are almost found, the two may consider their production and sales.However, those are things for later.The episodes of the villagers were quickly forgotten by Mu Yan and Mu Chen. These days they went to the forest every afternoon, but the soybeans were still missing.If the soybeans cannot be found, the system tasks cannot continue. Moreover, not only the soybeans, but also ingredients such as gypsum powder and soy sauce have no clue. The upgrade task this time may not be that simple.However, Mu Yan, who has always been optimistic and easy to satisfy, is not in a hurry, and Mu Chen, who is always centered on Mu Yan, is even less in a hurry.\u201cAh Chen, let\u2019s go to the field tomorrow to see if the wheat has germinated?\u201d Mu Yan asked Mu Chen, if there are weeds, weeding is still needed.\u201cEn.\u201d Mu Chen nodded.Because the wheat seeds are just planted, they don\u2019t require daily care until they germinate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Standing outside the fence and looking in, the scene inside can be seen at a glance. Mu Yan\u2019s eyes, which were already big, opened even wider at this moment, as if he couldn\u2019t believe it and couldn\u2019t recover.\u201cThis\u2026this\u2026how did this grow so fast?\u201d Mu Yan said subconsciously in a daze.He has also seen the wheat from germination to harvest in the previous life. It is only a few days, and it is already very good for the wheat to germinate. It\u2019s a centimeter high, and it doesn\u2019t look like it was planted just a few days ago.If Mu Yan hadn\u2019t planted it with his own hands a few days ago, he certainly wouldn\u2019t have believed it.\u201cYanyan, you are spreading some fertilizer, maybe you can harvest it soon.\u201d No. 5 didn\u2019t notice Mu Yan\u2019s abnormality at all, looking at the green wheat field, I couldn\u2019t help but drool. , said urgently.\u201cWhat fertilizer?\u201d Mu Yan asked blankly.\u201cIt\u2019s the growth fertilizer from before.\u201d No. 5 replied.Muyan:? ? ?\u201cThe growth fertilizer should have the effect of catalyzing growth, and spreading it will accelerate the growth of plants.\u201d Mu Chen explained to Mu Yan.Although he doesn\u2019t know if the current situation is normal for wheat, judging by Mu Yan\u2019s appearance, it should be different from the growth of ordinary wheat. In addition, No. 5 mentioned the growth of chemical fertilizers, so Mu Chen speculated The abnormality of wheat may be related to that chemical fertilizer.It turned out to be like this, and Mu Yan finally realized it.\u201cThen using chemical fertilizers to accelerate growth, will it harm the wheat?\u201d Mu Yan asked worriedly. Although he didn\u2019t know much about the truth, he also knew that accelerating growth was against natural growth, and against nature there was As long as there is a good side, there will also be a bad side.\u201cOf course not. I am the most advanced system. The system produced must be a high-quality product!\u201d No. 5 proudly puffed up her small chest and said proudly\u201cNo. 5 is the most powerful.\u201d Mu Yan complimented No. 5 along the way, and sure enough, he saw No. 5\u2019s chest puffed up even more.Looking at the green wheat seedlings, Mu Yan felt infinitely soft in his heart. This is the first time he has truly planted crops for his small family. Everything in it belongs to them, and there is no need to hand it in or Nice to share with others!However, growth fertilizers are good, but at the same time that the wheat was born, those weeds that should have just emerged also grew like chicken blood.Sure enough, every good side will be accompanied by a bad side, Mu Yan sighed helplessly.Opening the small door left by the fence, Mu Yan took out a small **** and began to work hard to weed.\u201cYanyan, why did you pull out the wheat seedlings?\u201d When No. 5 saw Mu Yan\u2019s actions, he was in Sparta.\u201cThese are all weeds, which will affect the growth of wheat.\u201d Mu Yan waved the weeds in his hands to show No. 5 that they are different from wheat seedlings.\u201cOh, that\u2019s it, then I\u2019ll help too.\u201d No. 5 said excitedly, these wheats are his rations in the future, how can he allow the nasty weeds to take away the living space of his rations, they must be eliminated!No. 5 has a small body and short hands and feet, but it still has fighting power. It flew to the top of a weed, and then tightly grasped the weed with its small hands and feet, and its body used its flying ability to fly upwards. The weed Driven by strength, he left the ground and was successfully pulled out by number five.\u201cYanyan, Yanyan, look quickly, I pulled out the weeds.\u201d Number fiveHolding the weeds it pulled out, excitedly approached Mu Yan, begging for praise.Mu Yan looked at the weeds, a little speechless, lightly patted No. 5\u2019s little head, couldn\u2019t bear to hit it, and said: \u201cThere aren\u2019t many weeds here, I can get rid of them soon, you go there to play first.\u201d Later.\u201d\u201cYanyan, I\u2019m also very good. I can also weed for you. With my help, you will definitely do it faster.\u201d Number five is still excited, and he is not willing to play by himself.\u201cIdiot, those are wheat seedlings.\u201d Mu Chen mercilessly hit the fiveIn the past, when Mu Chen couldn\u2019t see No. 5, No. 5 would often speak ill of him in front of Mu Yan behind his back and beat him up. Although Mu Chen couldn\u2019t see it, he still had a very strange feeling.Now that Mu Chen can see No. 5, the one-sided complaints before have turned into a mutual confrontation between the two, and Mu Yan who is in the middle is often made helpless by them.\u201cWho are you calling an idiot?\u201d No. 5 exploded immediately, grinning at Mu Chen.\u201cYou.\u201d Mu Chen replied concisely.\u201cYou are the idiot, your whole family are idiots!\u201d No. 5 said angrily.roared.However, after shouting, it realized with its small brain that Yan Yan is now Mu Chen\u2019s partner, so Mu Chen\u2019s family also includes Yan Yan, and he is Yan Yan\u2019s binding system, so he can also be regarded as Yan Yan\u2019s family yes, so\u2026\u201cIt really is an idiot.\u201d Seeing that No. 5 had reacted, Mu Chen couldn\u2019t help but twitch his mouth.Mu Yan, who was listening the whole time, was quite calm, and the movements of his hands were not disturbed at all.After all, No. 5 and Mu Chen would have such a confrontation from time to time, and Mu Yan, who was already used to it, pretended that he hadn\u2019t heard or seen it, and let the two of them play their best.\u201cHmph, you can weed if you have the ability.\u201d No. 5 was stunned and couldn\u2019t refute, so he said dryly.Mu Chen ignored No. 5, stepped in directly from the fence, stepped forward with his slender thighs, and directly entered the wheat field without the slightest pause or hindrance. If there was a little girl here, she would definitely be fascinated. She blushed with embarrassment.\u201cHmph, shameless.\u201d Number Five couldn\u2019t help but mutter in a low voice.Mu Chen squatted down next to Mu Yan, ignoring the dirt on the ground to stain his clothes, then he spotted a weed, pulled it out quickly and accurately, and then gave No. 5 a provocative look.Mu Yan, who watched the whole process, looked at the weeds in Mu Chen\u2019s hands, moved his lips, but finally said nothing.However, feeling how the provocative No. 5 could let Mu Chen go, he asked Mu Yan, \u201cYanyan, what he pulled out was also wheat seedlings.\u201dNo. 5 looked at the wheat seedling in his hand that he had pulled out by mistake, and looked at the one in Mu Chen\u2019s hand. He always felt that the two were the same, and suddenly gained confidence.\u201cAh Chen, why don\u2019t you go play with No. 5, I\u2019ll finish it in a while.\u201d Mu Yan looked at Mu Chen, then looked at No. 5, and finally said after thinking about it.He thought he said it very tactfully, but he didn\u2019t want this sentence to be too straightforward for No. 5 and Mu Chen\u2019s ears, as if he was saying \u201cwhat you plucked is also a wheat seedling\u201d.A flash of discomfort flashed across Mu Chen\u2019s face, but he soon returned to normal, and the speed was so fast that it was hard to catch.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d A merciless laugh came from No. 5, and No. 5 laughed and trembled, making one suspect that if this continues, it will fall off.With a dark face, Mu Chen inserted the wheat seedlings back into the soil, then walked out of the fence expressionlessly and walked towards No. 5.The belated No. 5 finally felt a bit of cold, stopped his insolent laughter, and then saw a certain black-faced Rakshasa walking towards him with a murderous face, and started to move towards the wood very cowardly. Yan called for help, \u201cYanyan, help, Mu Chen is going to kill someone.\u201d\u201cYou are not human.\u201d Mu Chen said in a cold voice.\u201cMu Chen is going to kill the system!\u201d No. 5 changed the name very kindly, and then continued to cry for help.Mu Chen: ..Wooden words: ..Mu Yan ignored this one-person-one system, and continued to weed without interference, because he knew that these two would not cause any major problems, and this was a valuable experience gained after several lessons.Because the area of the wheat field is not large and there are not many weeds, Mu Yan quickly completed the work of weeding.Standing up and stretching, the sore legs that squatted were stretched. Seeing this, Mu Chen hurried over and hugged him into his arms. His big warm hands helped Mu Yan gently knead the sore legs. The warmth of the numb thighs was transmitted through the skin, relieving a little pain.\u201cThank you Chen, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Mu Yan said with a cute and bright smile.\u201cNow I know weeds, I will remove them next time.\u201d Mu Chen said seriously.\u201cYeah.\u201d Mu Yan nodded with a smile, and then led the whole system towards home in the afterglow of the setting sun.Recently, the number of customers who came to buy buns and scallion pancakes has decreased. In the past, buns and scallion pancakes could be sold out within ten minutes from the moment they were brought out, but now they take half an hour or even longer to sell.Moreover, the quantity purchased by each customer has also been reduced a lot.Mu Yan didn\u2019t notice this detail, but Mu Chen noticed it, and frowned slightly.Although he doesn\u2019t want Mu Mu to be tired, and it is just in line with his wish that fewer people come to buy now, but if Mu Mu finds out, he will definitely be sadBut soon, the customers who came to buy told the reason for the decrease in the number of people.\u201cBoss, besides buns and scallion pancakes, do you have any other food?\u201d A customer who just bought buns asked with a smile.Although steamed stuffed buns and scallion pancakes taste very good, no matter how good the taste is, if you eat too much, you will get tired of it, but it is a pity to give upTherefore, many people eat buns for a period of time, and then go back to eat a few more.Ton nutrition powder to change the taste.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What everyone is looking forward to most now is to hope that Mu Yan and Mu Chen can make other foods, so that they don\u2019t need to eat unpalatable nutrition powder up.\u201cThat\u2019s right, little boss, if you are inventing a few more other foods, we will definitely support you a lot.\u201d\u201cThe little boss is so good, he can definitely make other food, and we will all cheer for the little boss.\u201d Other customers also followed suit, and they also worked hard to satisfy their appetites.\u201cOthers\u2026\u201d Mu Yan tilted his head, trying hard to search in his mind for the things he could make, as well as the ingredients he already had.What he knows are usually home-cooked side dishes, and now there are not many ingredients, and there are not many that can be made. The staple food still needs to be based on nutritional powderSteamed stuffed buns and scallion pancakes are the recipes given by the system. He has seen fried dough sticks, pies, radish rolls and other food in the town before.Fried dough sticks need a lot of oil to fry, which is too extravagant for them at present, so Mu Yan put his idea on pies and radish rolls.The pie is similar to steamed buns, but it needs more oil, but it is not as oily as fried dough sticks, and it tastes fragrant and crunchy, and it is delicious. It is easier to make radish rolls, and radish is the main They also found it.\u201cTomorrow we will make radish rolls and pies.\u201d Mu Yan said to the customer with a smile.\u201cRolls? Pies? What\u2019s that? Is it as delicious as steamed stuffed buns?\u201d\u201cWhat does the pie look like? Does it look like a scallion pancake?\u201d\u201cCarrot rolls? What a strange name, this is the first time I\u2019ve heard it?\u201d The customers couldn\u2019t help asking and discussing, obviously very interested in the new food^\u201cWe haven\u2019t heard of steamed stuffed buns and scallion pancakes before the little boss. Since the little boss came up with it, it must be delicious. I will definitely come here early tomorrow to line up.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, the product produced by the little boss must be a high-quality product. We are so lucky that we are the first batch of customers who know about the new food, ouch\u2026\u201cBoss, is the area surrounded by the edge of the forest edible?\u201d a customer suddenly asked.The other customers frowned when they heard this.Mu Yan circled the land at the edge of the forest, and everyone in Taohua Village knew about it, but because there was no use there, Mu Yan circled it as he did.Later, Mu Yan planted wheat in it, and the wheat seedlings germinated and grew. Many people went to see it out of curiosity, but everyone tacitly agreed to keep silent about it.Mu Yan made delicacies such as steamed stuffed buns and scallion pancakes, which improved the eating habits of the people in Taohua Village, let them finally taste the taste other than nutrition powder, and let them know that in addition to nutrition powder, there are other foods in the world. Such delicious food can satisfy the appetite, and even the mood will become better when eating.Let people in this world experience the charm of food for the first time.Therefore, everyone agreed that the ingredients planted in that field must be the ingredients that Muyan used to make delicious food. Although everyone was curious, for the sake of their own appetites in the future, everyone tried their best to suppress their curiosity, as if they hadn\u2019t seen anything To, and look forward to these things grow.Anyone who has a skill is always unwilling to be explored by others. After all, it is related to the interests of the family, but I did not expect that someone who is not good at it will ask it directly.Immediately, everyone looked at that person with unkind eyes.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s wheat. It can be made into flour, steamed buns and scallion pancakes in the future.\u201d Mu Yan didn\u2019t have so many tricks, so he replied directly.While admiring Mu Yan\u2019s bluntness, the customers secretly rejoiced.It turns out that Xiaobo\u2019s steamed stuffed buns and scallion pancakes are made of wheat. No wonder they are so delicious. I don\u2019t know what the plant called wheat will look like when it grows up, and what kind of flour is it? Woolen cloth? If they have flour, can they also make buns and scallion pancakes by themselves?Various thoughts emerged in everyone\u2019s hearts, but none of them showed on the surface. After all, it was discovered and planted by others.Since Mu Yan told everyone about Mai, different people often hang around around the wheat field. Some of them may really be curious about what Mai looks like, but some of them don\u2019t know what their thoughts are.However, Mu Yan did not stop everyone from going there because of this. After all, wheat will be promoted on this planet in the future. The ultimate mission of the system is to carry forward the food culture. He is the only one who can cook and know these ingredients. Obviously, it cannot be done. this task.The next day, Mu Yan made pies and radish rolls as he said. Pies are actually very easy to make, just one more step than steamed buns. Steamed buns are steamed in a pan, but pies are made by pressing the finished buns flat. Then pour some oil in the pan and fry until cooked.In addition, Mu Yan also tried to make a few shredded radish cakes, that is, cut the radish into thin shreds, then mix it with nutritional powder, flatten it into a cake shape, and fry it in a pan, so that the fragrance and nutrition of the shredded radish The powder is fully fused together, it tastes fragrant and crunchy, and it is also delicious.However, shredded radish pancakes are not made very much, and they are basically reserved for Mu Chen and No. 5 to eat, and they are not for sale.\u201cIt\u2019s so delicious, Yan Yan, you\u2019re so talented, I\u2019m not mistaken.\u201d Rubbing his bulging belly, No. 5 praised Mu Yan while also bragging about himself.Mu Yan just smiled connivingly at this, but Mu Chen couldn\u2019t help but let out a childish snort, wondering if this person and his system had a grudge in his previous life.\u201cOkay, you can take it out.\u201d Mu Yan said to Mu Chen, preventing this person from looking at each other full of \u201clove\u201d.Sure enough, as expected, once the radish rolls and pies were sold, they won the love of all customers. Although they had never tasted these before, with the buns and scallion pancakes as the basis, the radish rolls and pies were immediately popular. When it was sold out, those customers who didn\u2019t get it couldn\u2019t help stamping their heads, and even went to the familiar friends with shame, just to taste the pies and radish rolls they bought.The reputation of the Mu family has spread even further. Not only the nearby villages know that there is a Mu family who can cook delicious food in Taohua Village, but even the residents of the town have heard of it. When they came here, they just wanted to have a delicious taste different from nutrition powder, and many people even invited Mu Yan to open a shop in the town or even a bigger city.It\u2019s a pity that Mu Yan felt that his skills were limited, so he could only do these things for the time being, and he also had a sense of belonging to Taohua Village, so he politely declined the invitation of those people, which made them feel sorry, but also let Taohua The people in the village felt very proud, and even accepted Mu Yan and Mu Chen thoroughly.For a month in a row, the soybeans still disappeared, but under Mu Yan\u2019s tinkering with other foods, there were more and more types. The villagers of Taohua Village came to buy breakfast on time almost every morning, which seemed to have become their favorite food. Habit.The small breakfast table was no longer able to carry the heavy load. With the advice and help of the villagers, a large room was built next to Mu\u2019s house, which was used as a breakfast restaurant, and the food stalls officially settled in the snack bar.\u201cThank you for your help.\u201d Mu Yan sincerely thanked the villagers who helped them build restaurants for free.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so polite, little boss. It\u2019s not difficult to build a room, and you provide three meals a day. I\u2019m happy to let me build the house every day.\u201d The honest villager said with a smile.\u201cYes, and this is built, we can have breakfast directly in the store in the future, I will definitely come here every day.\u201d\u201cMe too, me too, the little boss must reserve a place for me.\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2026\u201dEveryone chatted and laughed together, and the atmosphere was very harmonious, which made Mu Yan feel very at ease and warm.The folk customs here are very different from those in their world, but he likes it very much, and he is very glad that he has come to this world.Due to the increase in chemical fertilizers, the wheat in the field has already begun to ear, and it will be harvested in about half a month. This makes Mu Yan even more happy from ear to ear. Recently, he is always in a happy mood. .\u201cYou are a bastard, you have neither father nor mother, we will not play with you.\u201d\u201cGo away, don\u2019t follow us.\u201d\u201cGo away go away.\u201dA group of children kept cursing around one child, and occasionally a child picked up a small stone and threw it at the silent child in the middle.Mu Yan was planning to go to the wheat field to have a look, this is the necessary homework he would do every day, and then he saw such a scene.The bullied child in the middle reminded him immediately of the bullied scene when he was a child.\u201cThese kids are too much, the one in the middle has a broken head.\u201d No. 5 floated in the air, his sight was wider than Mu Yan\u2019s, and he saw more.Hearing No. 5\u2019s voice, Mu Yan woke up from the memories and hurried forward.When the other children saw Mu Yan approaching, they ran over one after another, surrounded him, and talked in a hurry.\u201cBrother Muyan, the buns you made are delicious, do you have any other fillings?\u201d\u201cBrother Muyan, you are amazing. My dad goes to your house to buy breakfast every day. It\u2019s delicious.\u201d\u201cBrother Mu Yan\u2026\u201dThe children surrounded Muyan, chattering, with bright smiles unique to children on their faces, which made people\u2019s hearts soften when they saw it.In fact, children at this age are both angels and demons, because their actions are unintentional, ignorant and direct, but it is precisely because of this that they will make people feel softer, but they may also make people feel more cruelHowever, demons can also become angels if someone guides them well.\u201cThere will be more different delicious food in the future, but can you tell me first, why do you bully others?\u201d Mu Yan squatted down, equalized with the children, and asked in a gentle tone.\u201cBrother Muyan, you have to stay away from him, his parents don\u2019t want him anymore, he\u2019s a bastard.\u201d A child said directly.The little boy who was injured before shrank himself even smaller, with his head lowered, making it impossible to see his appearance and expression clearly, only his blood-stained hair can be seen, which is shocking.\u201cYou can\u2019t say that. Do others know that even if his parents are gone, he is still the baby of the family, just like you. You should care more about him instead of bullying him. Children who bully others are not good children. You can\u2019t get delicious food.\u201d Mu Yan guided the children very patiently.For children, he has a natural affection, so he can\u2019t see any child being bullied, and he can\u2019t see children hurting others because of ignorance.\u201cBrother Muyan, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The children lowered their heads and apologized.Their minds are very simple, so they need more guidance. When someone guides them, they can accept the correct ideas faster.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t apologize to me, but to him.\u201d Mu Yan pointed to the little boy who had been silent.The other children glanced at the little boy, and seemed to be struggling, but they finally ran to the boy and said sorry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although the little boy was still silent this time, he didn\u2019t run away, which made Mu Yan\u2019s actions faster.After disinfection, put a cute band-aid with a cartoon on it, and the little boy\u2019s wound is healed.\u201cMy name is Mu Yan, what\u2019s your name?\u201d Mu Yan asked.The little boy looked only six or seven years old, and his body was very thin. The clothes on his body were a little messy because of the children before, but it was not difficult to see that the clothes he wore before were relatively neat and clean, which showed that this little boy was not Is an orphan, or someone is taking care of him.Mu Yan tried his best to search for information about the little boy in his mind, but found nothing.Although most of the villagers had gone to his house to buy breakfast, and he knew most of the ones he had visited, he still couldn\u2019t find any information about the little boy.The little boy pursed his lips tightly and moved them, but he still didn\u2019t say anything in the end, but the big hands on his head that kept stroking his hair made him feel very kind.Looking at the little boy who became more and more silent, Mu Yan\u2019s eyes were a little sour, and he gently pulled him into his arms, regardless of the mess on his body, he hugged him gently and patted his back.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, those kids don\u2019t mean anything malicious, they just don\u2019t know, I live in Mu\u2019s house not far from here, if you are free, you can come and play with me, I\u2019ll cook something delicious for you.\u201d Mu Yan\u2019s voice Even more gentle, after helping the little boy tidy up his clothes and hair, left some snacks, stood up and left.After Mu Yan left, the little boy raised his head for the first time, looked at the back that was getting further and further away, until he could no longer see him, then looked down at the snacks with tempting aromas beside him, couldn\u2019t help stretching out his hand He took a piece, tasted it, and then moved faster and faster until there was still half of the food left. As if he had been awakened, he stopped immediately, carefully wrapped the rest, and walked towards another place in the village. Edge ran.\u201cThat little boy just now is so pitiful.\u201d No. 5 is still feeling emotional now. He probably lived here for a few months and met mostly simple villagers. This is the second time he has seen such bullying. here.The first time was when Yang Yinghao and Yang Yingying were bullied by a bully, but bullies are not common.\u201cWell, I hope he won\u2019t be bullied again in the future.\u201d Mu Yan said in a depressed mood.\u201cYanyan, let\u2019s go to the wheat field quickly, the wheat must have grown taller again.\u201cNo. 5 hurriedly changed the subject, if Mu Yan was allowed to go home with such emotions, that big **** would definitely kill him.In the next few days, Mu Yan could often see the little boy being bullied, always watching him from afar, hiding in a corner, sometimes Mu Yan greeted him with a smile, but the other party shrank like a frightened little animal. I went back, and when I felt safe, I quietly poked my head out again.Mu Yan didn\u2019t mind either, he still greeted each time he saw him, and even gave him some homemade snacks. Gradually, the little boy became familiar with Mu Yan.\u201cI, my name is Qiao An.\u201d The little boy took the initiative to talk to Mu Yan for the first time.\u201cQiao An, it\u2019s a nice name. Then I\u2019ll call you Xiao An from now on. My name is Mu Yan. You can call me Brother A Yan. He is Mu Chen. You can call him Brother A Chen.\u201d Mu Yan was gentle. Said with a smile, touching Joan\u2019s somewhat messy hair.\u201cBrother Ah Yan.\u201d The little boy only yelled, and he didn\u2019t seem to speak very often, speaking very slowly, with a strange tone, but his voice was soft and waxy that is unique to children.\u201cGood boy, we are going to the wheat field today, do you want to go with us?\u201d Mu Yan invited with a smile.The little boy didn\u2019t answer, but he didn\u2019t leave either, a silent movement replaced his answer.Mu Yan stretched out his hand to touch the little boy\u2019s hair, and was held tightly by a big warm hand in the next second, and moved away from the little boy\u2019s head without any trace.\u201cIt\u2019s getting late, hurry up.\u201d Mu Chen\u2019s eyes were deep, and he glanced at the little boy, but his tone of voice to Mu Yan was very gentle.The little boy shrank his neck subconsciously, and was five steps behind Mu Yan and Mu Chen. No matter what Mu Yan called him, he would always stick to this distance.The wheat in the field has already headed. It is growing very well and the grains are full. Looking at it makes people feel very satisfied and has a sense of accomplishment, especially for Mu Yan.This is the first time he owns his own land, the first time he grows his own crops, and the first harvest is about to come, so the wheat in the field is very precious and meaningful to him.Of course, it is also of great significance to the world, and it can be said to be a milestone in history.\u201cIt grows really well, after weeding the last time, it can be harvested.\u201cMu Yan couldn\u2019t wait to walk into the field, touched the ears of wheat, and said with a smile.\u201cYou go to rest under the tree for a while, after I finish weeding, we will go to the forest.\u201d Mu Chen took Mu Yan\u2019s little hand, took out a soft cushion and put it on a smooth stone, so that Mu Yan could sit more comfortably. Comfortable.The stone under the tree was specially moved by Mu Chen and polished flat, so that there would be a place for Mu Yan to sit and rest when he came to the field.Mu Yan was not polite either, knowing that Ah Chen would not let him do it. After all, except for the first weeding, it was Ah Chen who did the rest. Even if he wanted to help, the other party would not allow him, and his speed was too slow. Not as fast as Ah Chen, so he simply obeyed him, and every time his heart was as sweet as eating honey.\u201cXiao An, come here and Mu Yan waved to Qiao An, signaling him to sit next to him.Qiao An walked over obediently, but he was still unwilling to sit down, so Mu Yan had no choice but to follow him, and asked a few simple questions to understand.For this well-behaved child, Mu Yan likes it very much, and secretly looks forward to it, hoping that his and Ah Chen\u2019s children can be so well-behaved and cute in the future.Seeing that Mu Yan was talking to Qiao An again, Mu Chen couldn\u2019t help speeding up his movements. What could have been done in half an hour, this time it was completed in a quarter of an hour.\u201cMumu, the removal is over, we are going to the forest.\u201d Mu Chen said\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Yan replied, and then said to Qiao An: \u201cXiao An, we are going to the forest, it is very dangerous there, I can\u2019t take you there, you go back first, when you come back, I am cooking for you of.\u201dJoan nodded obediently, then turned and walked towards the village.\u201cI don\u2019t know if we can find soybeans today.\u201d Mu Yan muttered in a low voice, Joan\u2019s footsteps paused, and then gradually drifted away.\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for it for so long and I haven\u2019t seen it. Maybe Soybean isn\u2019t in this forest at all.\u201d Number five was also very sad. Without Soybean, he couldn\u2019t continue to complete the upgrade task.\u201cWhere would it be if it wasn\u2019t here?\u201d Mu Yan couldn\u2019t help asking, he was familiar with this place now, if there were really no soybeans here, then he would definitely have to look elsewhere.\u201cThis world is very big. Apart from this planet, there are many other planets. There must be soybeans, but with our current capabilities, it is simply too difficult to leave this planet.\u201d Number Five said.\u201cAh?\u201d Mu Yan was confused, completely listening to what Number Five said.don\u2019t know.For a brother who came from the primitive world, it is already very difficult to accept the high technology of this world. Telling him that there are other planets with higher technology, I am afraid that it will scare him into fainting.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll find it, the forest is so big.\u201d Mu Chen comforted Mu Yan, and gave No. 5 a hard look, so scared that No. 5 immediately shrank into a ball, and didn\u2019t dare to speak casually.This trip to the forest still did not find soybeans, but the harvest was not small. Many other ingredients were found, and they could be used for cooking. What surprised Mu Yan was that he actually found\u2026\u201cAchen, No. 5, look quickly, it\u2019s rice, it\u2019s really rice!\u201d Mu Yan pointed at the heavy rice field and danced excitedly.Although the area of this paddy field is very, very small, even if all of it is collected, it may only weigh about ten kilograms, but it still can\u2019t affect Mu Yan\u2019s excited mood, and even the depression of not finding soybeans is all forgotten\u201cRice? Can it be used to make rice?\u201d No. 5\u2019s small eyes suddenly shone brightly, and asked hastily.\u201cYeah.\u201d Mu Yan nodded excitedly.One person, one system seemed to have eaten the rice and was still extremely excited, but Mu Chen had already silently stepped forward to harvest all the rice and tied it up with soft vines.\u201cAh Chen, you are so amazing.\u201d Mu Yan noticed Mu Chen\u2019s movements, and immediately stepped forward to hug him adoringly, and rubbed him dependently, feeling full of happiness.Mu Chen touched Mu Yan\u2019s upturned little face, lowered his head and kissed lovingly.No. 5 acted as if he hadn\u2019t seen anything, and silently sent the rice into the system space. For the two who often regarded it as nothing and showed affection in front of it, they had already grown accustomed to it from gnashing their teeth at first.Yes, habit playing is such a terrible thing.\u201cIt\u2019s getting late, let\u2019s go back quickly.\u201d Number Five said flatly.\u201cYeah, when we harvest the wheat and plant the rice, we will have flour and rice to eat in the future.\u201d Mu Yan thought that these foods were getting closer and closer to the previous life, and he was in a very good mood, and Very accomplishedfeel.In a world where there is no gourmet food, it is really a joyful and joyful process to dig out edible ingredients bit by bit, and then make them, and let others accept and taste the taste of gourmet food. A sense of accomplishment.In the beginning, Mu Yan only accepted such a task for the sake of system upgrade, but now, he is really enjoying the process, just like the greatest achievement and satisfaction of a chef is to see the diners eat happily and make it himself gourmet food.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 - Joan, the little angel who delivered the ingredientsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cYanyan, here we come again.\u201d No. 5 quickly flew to Muyan\u2019s side and said speechlessly.Mu Yan followed to the door, and when he came back, he had a few more strange-looking plants in his hands, and then used the identification technique to identify them one by one.\u201cEndo, not edible.\u201d\u201cAcacia, not edible.\u201d\u201cRed fruit, edible.\u201dThis situation has been going on for three days. Every morning when I wake up, I will find some strange plants at the door, sometimes it is some branches and leaves, sometimes it is some fruits, and I don\u2019t know who put it there. On the other hand, after throwing out the identification technique, he can occasionally identify edible things, which also makes Mu Yan even more curious about the purpose of the person who sent these things.The first time they found this, no one took it seriously. When they found it the next day, No. 5 decided to get up early and squat, but when it got up, the thing had already appeared at the door, as if it had appeared out of thin air It seems that this frustrates Number Five.\u201cHow early does that person get up?\u201d No. 5 complained depressedly, and at the same time, his fighting spirit was aroused, and he vowed to catch this person.So, on the night of No. 5, he tried his best to stay up all night. When the sky was about to get dark, No. 5 suddenly saw a small figure walking towards him in the distance, and immediately became nervous and excited.The figure was getting closer and closer, and number five became more excited, the hairs on his body stood on end, and he was ready to fly towards the bedroom at any time.\u201cYanyan, Yanyan, he has appeared, get up quickly.\u201d Number five\u2019s voice was sharp enough to wake up those who were still sleeping.Mu Chen\u2019s sharp eyes shot at No. 5, making him immediately swallow the next words forcefully, but at this time Mu Yan had already been woken up by him, and sat up rubbing his sleepy eyes.\u201cAh Chen, what happened?\u201d Mu Yan asked subconsciously as his head was still a little confused.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can sleep again.\u201d Mu Chen gently patted Mu Yan\u2019s back, coaxing him.But Mu Yan was also confused for a while, and then remembered the matter of No. 5 squatting guarding the mysterious person. Hearing No. 5\u2019s voice just now, it must be that person who appeared.\u201cNo. 5, did that person show up?\u201d Mu Yan hurriedly asked\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d Number Five nodded hastily.Mu Yan immediately began to put on his clothes, and after waiting for several days, it finally arrived.Mu Chen had no choice but to secretly stare at No. 5, and then he got dressed and went out together.When the door of Mu\u2019s house opened, that person was just putting down the things on his back, maybe he didn\u2019t expect the door to open suddenly, and he was stunned on the spot.\u201cXiao An?\u201d Mu Yan exclaimed in surprise, apparently he did not expect that this person would be Qiao An.\u201cAh, brother Ayan\u2026\u201d Qiao An stood there awkwardly, a little at a loss.Mu Yan looked at Qiao An, then at the plants that had just been put down, and asked, \u201cDid you send these these days?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Xiao An\u2019s voice was like a mosquito, keeping her head down and not daring to lift it up\u201cWhere did you get these?\u201d\u201cIn the forest.\u201d Joan\u2019s voice became softer.\u201cYou went to the forest alone?\u201d Mu Yan was even more surprised, but also worried. He couldn\u2019t imagine how a child from the other party went to the forest alone to find so many plants.Joan wasn\u2019t answering, but that appearance obviously acquiesced. \u201cXiao An, you can\u2019t go to the forest alone in the future, it\u2019s too dangerous for you.\u201d Mu Yan said hastily, frowning tightly, with a serious expression.Every time Chen followed, he dared to go a little bit deeper, and he needed to bring a lot of medicines in case Wan Xiaoan was so young, how could he go to the forest alone, it was too dangerous.Xiao An\u2019s head drooped even lower, and his whole body was wrapped in a depressed atmosphere.Mu Yan stepped forward to touch the other party\u2019s little head distressedly, patted the other party comfortingly, and said softly: \u201cXiao An, brother Yan appreciates your kindness, but the forest is really too dangerous for children. If you If something goes wrong, Brother Ah Yan will feel guilty and sad, so don\u2019t go there in the future, okay?\u201dAfter these few days, how could Mu Yan still not know Qiao An\u2019s purpose, he was helping him find ingredients, he was very touched by this kindness, but he couldn\u2019t take it for granted.\u201cBrother Ah Yan\u2026\u201d Xiao An murmured, wanting to say something but stopped talking.\u201cHuh?\u201d Mu Yan encouraged the other party to continue.\u201cI want to help you.\u201d Xiao An finally mustered up the courage and said.He has been living with his grandparents since he was very young. Apart from his grandparents, Brother Ah Yan is the first person who treats him so well. He not only drives away those who bully him, but also often cooks him delicious food. The words are also very gentle, which makes him feel very warm, and always wants to keep getting closerBut he was too young to do anything, and he couldn\u2019t help Brother Ah Yan, so when he heard that Brother Ah Yan wanted soybeans, he made up his mind to help Brother Ah Yan find soybeans. He didn\u2019t want to see Brother Ah Yan showing distress expression.But he didn\u2019t know what soybeans were or what they looked like, so he had to go to the forest and bring back the plants that looked like they might be, and let Brother Ah Yan decide for himself.\u201cIf you really want to help me, why don\u2019t you come to my snack bar every day after school to help, the snack bar is just short of people and is planning to recruit workers.\u201d Mu Yan said with a smile.As the reputation of the snack bar spreads, more and more people come to eat every day. Even if there are limited sales every day, they will still be too busy during the meal period. Therefore, he really plans to recruit people to help.\u201cIs it really possible?\u201d Joan immediately raised his head upon hearing this, with a look of anticipation in his eyes.\u201cOf course, but it can\u2019t affect your study, or you can only go back and let you concentrate on your studies.\u201d Mu Yan said with a smile, and told him the specific working hours and salary.\u201cI don\u2019t want a salary.\u201d Xiao An said, as long as he can help brother Ah Yan.\u201cEveryone who comes to work here must be paid, otherwise I won\u2019t be able to hire you.\u201d Mu Yan said, Qiao An wanted to say something, but Mu Yan blocked him back, and then sent him away.\u201cYanyan, it is illegal to employ minors.\u201d Number Five said with a frown, clearly disapproving.Xiao An is only ten years old, and looks more like a six or seven-year-old child, still a minor.\u201cI know that the person who should be hired will continue to be hired, as long as he is allowed to play in the store.\u201d Mu Yan said with a smile, of course he would not really treat Xiao An as a hired worker.Mu Yan yawned, it\u2019s not yet dawn, usually at this time, they are still in the warm bed, I really don\u2019t know why Qiao An got up so early.Thinking of this, Mu Yan felt more pity for Qiao An.\u201cGo to sleep again, it\u2019s still early.\u201d Mu Chen embraced Mu Yan and walked towards the bedroom, then shut No. 5 outside the door.Mu Yan didn\u2019t resist the drowsiness, and soon fell asleep. Mu Chen looked at it quietly for a while, then stood up and walked out, apparently not intending to continue sleeping.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Number Five asked warily.Mu Chen glanced at it lightly, then went straight into the kitchen to check how the dough fermented last night, and then started chopping stuffing to prepare for the opening of the snack bar.No. 5 has been wobbly flying above Mu Chen, watching his hand movements, proficient and fast, many ingredients are constantly being decomposed under his knife, but they are more beautiful than the whole, not only amazed.If he hadn\u2019t known that there was no such industry as a chef in this world, he would really have thought that Mu Chen had practiced knife skills since he was a child, and even many chefs who practiced since childhood in the world were not as dexterous as Mu Chen.I have to admit that Mu Chen is really talented in this area, even more talented than his little host. Although he is a bit dissatisfied with the little host binding Mu Chen as a system partner, but for now, this is very correct decision.Because what Mu Chen did would also be recognized by the system, and a certain amount of points would be given. It could even be said that Mu Chen got more points than the little host.If the points are only repaid by the little host, maybe they will never see the hope of becoming zero.Alas\u2026 Even if you don\u2019t want to admit it, you have to admit it.It was only when the sun was high that Mu Yan woke up from the sleepy sleep. Looking at the wall clock on the wall, the hour hand had already pointed to the number 9. At this time, the busiest period of the snack bar was almost over.Mu Yan put on his clothes in a hurry, and hurried towards the snack bar.He doesn\u2019t know why he always feels that he doesn\u2019t get enough sleep recently. Every time he wakes up, it\u2019s eight or nine o\u2019clock. Several times, it\u2019s all about letting Chen go to work in the snack bar alone. There are many things to do, but he still Because he slept late and threw it all to Ah Chen, then Ah Chen must be busier and more tired.When Mu Yan arrived at the snack bar, he saw Mu Chen who was busy inside, and felt even more guilty about it, his eyes were full of self-blame.\u201cAre you awake? Are you still sleepy?\u201d Seeing Mu Yan approaching, Mu Chen hurriedly put down the things in his hands, stepped forward, and asked carefully.Regarding Mu Yan\u2019s situation, if it was someone else, they might just think that Mu Yan was sleeping late, but for Mu Chen who knows Mu Yan very well, he could find a deeper problem. If he didn\u2019t find other symptoms, He had already taken Mu Yan to the hospital for a physical examination.Mu Yan shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sleepy anymore, you must call me early tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Chen replied with a smile, but Mu Yan knew that every time he would agree, but he never did it.\u201cBoss, your breakfast is really great. If the store is open all day, I will definitely come here for three meals a day.\u201d A customer greeted Mu Yan with a smile.\u201cI can only make these breakfasts now, lunch and dinner are not yet available.\u201d Mu Yan replied.\u201cLittle boss, you don\u2019t need to add anything else. They are also sold at noon and evening. My daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law now have to buy enough for a day to go back every day.\u201d\u201cThese don\u2019t taste good when they\u2019re cold, it\u2019s better to eat them while they\u2019re hot.\u201d Mu Yan warned.\u201cNo way, they can\u2019t eat nutrition powder at all now.\u201d\u201cThere are few people in the store now, and we are too busy for breakfast alone. We can only wait for a while for lunch and dinner.\u201d Mu Yan said helplessly, thinking that he should recruit people quickly.\u201cDoes the little boss want to recruit workers? Your business is so good that you can recruit a few people to help. If you open both lunch and dinner, the business will definitely be better.\u201d The customers\u2019 eyes lit up when they heard the words.\u201cThere is a plan to recruit people.\u201d Mu Yan nodded.The eyes of the others became brighter when they heard the words, but before they could say anything, Mu Yan was pulled into the back kitchen by Mu Chen, and he gave each customer a cold eye as a gift.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 - Tofu and Tofu BrainPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIf everyone can speak freely when facing Mu Yan, then when facing Mu Chen, they are always trembling in their hearts. They really don\u2019t understand why such a soft and sticky little boss would marry such a cold and paralyzed big boss. I don\u2019t understand, I don\u2019t understand.After seeing off the last customer, Mu Chen quickly cleaned up the snack bar, then locked the door, took Mu Yan\u2019s little hand, and walked home together.Number five was flying around the pair of plants Xiao An sent in the morning. Although it was a system elf, it couldn\u2019t identify these plants without Mu Yan\u2019s permission.\u201cYanyan, hurry up and identify these plants.\u201d No. 5 hurriedly said when he saw Muyan.Only then did Mu Yan think of these plants, and then passed the identification technique next to each other, and the sound of inedibleness filled his ears.\u201cRed poplar, not edible.\u201d\u201cMingqing, it\u2019s not edible.\u201d\u201cSoybean, leguminous, edible.\u201d\u201cRed Qi, inedible.\u201dAfter identifying all the plants, Mu Yan habitually wanted to pile these plants into the utility room, but suddenly stopped in the middle of the action.\u201cDid I hear an edible one just now?\u201d Mu Yan asked Mu Chen blankly.Mu Chen nodded, and then quickly pulled out a branch with black fruit hanging from a pile of plants.\u201cI said, is there something wrong with your eyes? It was clearly identified as soybeans just now. What are you doing with this black cloth Longdong?\u201d No. 5 habitually yelled at Mu Chen, and then paused after speaking. Suddenly became very surprised.\u201cYanyan, it\u2019s Huangdou, it\u2019s Huangdou. I heard Huangdou\u2019s voice just now.\u201d Number five danced excitedly.After searching for so long, they finally found the news about soybeans. It couldn\u2019t be better!Mu Yan looked at No. 5, then at Mu Chen, and then threw an identification technique towards the black fruit.The sound of the system without temperature sounded again: \u201cSoybean, leguminous, edible.\u201dNumber five, who was circling in circles, suddenly stopped in mid-air, looking at the black fruit with pea-sized eyes, and listening to the sound of the system identification, suddenly felt like twitching.\u201cShouldn\u2019t soybeans be yellow?\u201dNima, I have never seen soybeans that are black, so why is it called soybeans, why not just black beans? Number Five wanted to throw the table.No matter what, he finally found soybeans, and this news was enough to make Mu Yan excited, which meant that he could make other delicacies again, and he could continue to do the upgrade task.Mu Chen looked at Mu Yan who was smiling happily, and the corners of his mouth were slightly raised, his smile was gentle, without the coldness that made the customer shudder.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that kid to be so powerful. We have been looking for soybeans for so long, but he found them by mistake.\u201d Number five couldn\u2019t help feeling that the world is impermanent.\u201cWell, Xiaoan is very powerful.\u201d Mu Yan said with a bright smile. Mu Chen paused for a moment, his eyes became deep.In fact, it\u2019s no wonder they couldn\u2019t find soybeans. After all, the soybeans in this world look completely different from those in the previous life. Although the names are the same, they are comparable in size to walnuts and are still black in color. They have been looking for them according to the standards of the previous life. , it would be strange to find it.\u201cNext time when Xiaoan comes over, you must ask him where he found the soybeans. There must be more, and this is not enough.\u201dAfter asking Xiao An, Mu Chen and Mu Yan took No. 5 to the place where the soybeans grew, looked at the black fruit all over the tree, and the two of them were silent for a while.Mu Yan and No. 5 are silent because the soybean here is completely different from the previous life, and Mu Chen\u2019s silence is completely habitual.But no matter what, since the identification technique gave the result, then this is the raw material they will use to make tofu nao and tofu.\u201cI\u2019ll go up to pick it up, you can pick it up below.\u201d Mu Chen said to Mu Yan, and then he climbed up the tree in twos or twos, shaking the branches, and the black fruits fell like rain.No. 5 flew to a higher place, holding the black fruit in his short hand, and pulling it down vigorously, while Mu Yan picked up the fallen fruit below.The two cooperated very tacitly with one system, and quickly picked up several baskets and returned home. It became a problem to grind the black fruit into powder. Mu Yan looked directly at No. 5, which meant it was self-evident.However, this time, No. 5 did not cry like the previous few times, but exchanged the stone mill very readily, and the exchange was fully automatic, no manpower was required to complete it, and the points cost would naturally be higher.Although No. 5 still had a bit of pain in his heart, he recovered quickly, thinking that Mu Chen\u2019s ability to earn points is still very good, as long as they work hard, they will always pay back the points, and it is more important to upgrade now.Everything is almost ready, Mu Yan decided to try to make tofu according to the recipe first.The first step of the recipe is to soak the soybeans, which need to be soaked for several hours. Therefore, Mu Yan put some soybeans in a large basin and soaked them in water, planning to continue the next step after soaking.Now the soybeans are also found, the rice is also available, the wheat is about to mature, and there are a lot of ingredients found, so Mu Yan decided not to go to the forest for a few days, in addition to harvesting wheat and making tofu, let everyone rest For a while, especially Mu Chen, he was the one who worked hard every day.\u201cAchen, let\u2019s find some small workers to help in the store, so that you don\u2019t have to work so hard.\u201d Mu Yan said guiltily, knowing that he couldn\u2019t help much.\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Chen rubbed his soft hair and replied with a smile.\u201cThen write the recruitment notice, I\u2019m not very proficient yet.\u201d Mu Yan lowered his head embarrassedly.During this period of time, he has been learning to recognize and write with Ah Chen. Although he knows a lot, his writing is not much better than that of beginners.\u201cYou\u2019re already good at writing, and it will be better if you practice more.\u201d Mu Chen patted his little head and encouraged.Mu Chen went to make lunch, while Mu Yan sat on the rocking chair in the yard, basking in the sun comfortably, feeling drowsy.After lunch, the two hugged each other and took a nice nap. After getting up, the soybeans were almost soaked.Mu Chen put the soybeans into an automatic refiner and beat them into a pulp, then found a piece of fine gauze to filter all the bean dregs, repeated several times, only the soybean milk remained, and put it aside for later use.Gypsum tofu needs edible gypsum water points, but edible shixu is not available here, so you still need to spend points to redeem in the system.Mix the gypsum powder with warm water, then slowly pour it into the soy milk, stirring constantly, at this time the protein begins to precipitate.After standing still for half an hour, filter the sediment and soy milk, and then press it in the prepared square mold to make the tofu more compact. After that, remove the mold, and the square tofu comes out.Mu Yan broke off a small piece and tasted it, and found that the taste was not bad, then broke off a large piece and handed it to Mu Chen\u2019s mouth.\u201cAh Chen, try it.\u201d Mu Yan\u2019s eyes sparkled.Mu Chen looked at the little hand that was whiter and tenderer than the tofu, his eyes were deeper, he lowered his head and put the little hand into his mouth deliberately, and licked it carefully.Mu Yan\u2019s face immediately turned red, he lowered his head in embarrassment, and wanted to pull his hand out, the warm mouth transmitted the temperature to his body\u201cAchen\u2026\u201d Mu Yan cried out as if begging for mercy, but he didn\u2019t know that the soft and waxy voice catalyzed the animal nature in Mu Chen\u2019s body even more.Relying on great self-control, Mu Chen barely suppressed the whirling in his heart.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201d Mu Chen said with a slightly hoarse voice, and he didn\u2019t know whether he was talking about tofu or someone\u2019s little hands.\u201cMing, I\u2019ll make better and delicious food for you tomorrow.\u201d Mu Yan didn\u2019t dare to look up, and said shyly.\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Chen lowered his head, and the warm breath brushed against Mu Yan\u2019s ears, causing waves of trembling.\u201cI, I, I\u2019m going to the kitchen.\u201d Mu Yan stammered, and ran into the kitchen with a blushing face, leaving Mu Chen behind with a low smile.No. 5 acts as a blind person the whole time, and doesn\u2019t care whether he sees or hears. It doesn\u2019t want to be a light bulb, and it doesn\u2019t want to be blinded. It will definitely find a gentler and better system sister in the future, so it won\u2019t be envious, hehe !Since the snack bar posted a recruitment notice, the applicants almost squeezed the threshold, and many people followed suit and came to queue up for interviews.\u201cThis store doesn\u2019t look very big. Why do so many people come to interview? Could it be that the salary is very high?\u201d One person who followed the trend in the queue couldn\u2019t help asking, and the others who didn\u2019t know were listening carefully.Conformity is the nature of human beings, even in the interstellar era, it is still deeply rooted in human nature.\u201cThe salary is two thousand credits per month.\u201d The insider replied.\u201cIt\u2019s so low? Then why do they continue to go to interviews one after another?\u201d Hearing this, the man couldn\u2019t believe what he heard. In this era where the average salary is 3,000 credits, 2,000 credits can\u2019t even reach the average.\u201cTake out three meals a day.\u201d\u201cAh? Even if you manage food and housing, the salary is too low.\u201dThat person was a little shaken. He thought it was a high-paying job, so he wanted to follow along to see, but who knew it was a basic-paying job.Even if you control food and housing, so what, you can eat as much as you can, nutrition powder is so cheap.The person in the know gave the interrogator a cold look and said:\u201cYou certainly haven\u2019t eaten here.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, let alone two thousand credit points, even if you don\u2019t have any credit points, as long as you eat three meals a day, I will come for an interview!\u201d\u201cThe three meals that the little boss eats must be richer than those made in the store. Last time I passed by the little boss\u2019s house, I almost knocked on the door because of the smell.\u201cThere are so many people interviewing, and I don\u2019t know if I can be admitted. Alas\u2026 the small boss only recruits five people.\u201dCustomers who knew about the snack bar gathered together to discuss, while those who followed suit were stunned. They couldn\u2019t understand why so many people were chasing after a salary of only 2,000, and they were even worried that they would lose the election.But even though they knew that the wages were very low, everyone didn\u2019t leave. Just because of this confusion, everyone also wanted to see what the charm of this small shop could attract so many people.There are only two interviewers at the snack bar, that is, Mu Chen and Mu Yan, and at most there can be a No. 5 who is invisible to everyone.The interview process is not difficult. There is a knife and a washed white radish on each table. Mu Yan will ask everyone who comes to the interview to cut the radish. Of course, he will demonstrate it first beforehand. Then they will observe the process and results of cutting radishes.All the interviewees looked at the radish in front of them with a knife, and they all looked confused. They didn\u2019t understand why the applicants for the waiter still needed to do these things.\u201cThis is white radish, you can eat it.\u201d Mu Yan explained, although the explanation didn\u2019t go to the point, but it was enough.As soon as everyone heard that it was edible, their eyes lit up immediately. The previous doubts were instantly forgotten, and the way they looked at the white radish changed completely. They all imitated Mu Yan\u2019s previous action of cutting radish and began to try. .Both Mu Yan and Mu Chen secretly observed their actions and cut effects, and gradually had a candidate in their hearts.In fact, this time when recruiting employees, Mu Yan not only wants to recruit waiters, but also prepares for training chefs in the future. After all, their small shop will definitely need to cook more and more food in the future. It is difficult to complete, not to mention that the original purpose of the system is to promote food culture, so teaching others cooking skills is naturally included.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was very easy when I saw the little boss cut it just now.\u201d A person looked at the messy cut radishes on the table and sighed.\u201cI\u2019m going crazy, how can I do it?\u201d Someone went crazy.With a sound of \u201cdong\u201d, a person\u2019s carrot came out of his hand and rolled directly to the ground, and that person was still holding a knife, stunned.\u201cDoes the little boss need to cut these every day? It\u2019s really hard work. Even if the price of breakfast increases a bit, it\u2019s worth it.\u201d Someone sighed, and many people echoed.If you don\u2019t do many things, you don\u2019t know the hard work and hardship involved. Only after experiencing it yourself, you will know the hard-won results.When it was time for the interview, Mu Yan looked at the radish cutting results of eight people next to each other. Some people cut the radish into pieces, and some just chopped the radish. , but he just couldn\u2019t cut a piece.Obviously, this group of interviewees was not qualified.One interview can interview eight people at the same time. Although none of the eight people were qualified this time, none of them complained. Instead, they admired Mu Yan and Mu Chen even more. When they left, they all had smiles on their faces, making the outside world The people waiting for the interview were beating their hearts, lest they would be fully recruited before it was their turn.Those who had interviewed did not leave after the interview. Instead, they continued to surround the door, intending to see the interview situation of the people below, while others who had not interviewed gathered around them to ask about the interview process.\u201cWhat did you do in there? Have you passed?\u201d\u201cOld Li, what is our relationship, tell me about the content of the interview later.\u201d\u201cOld Chen, I\u2019ll treat you to dinner tonight, tell me if you\u2019ve passed.\u201dEveryone came together in twos and threes in front of the people they knew, and talked about friendship, just to get a little bit of interview content, so that they could prepare in advance.Those who had interviewed immediately raised their airs, and felt proud in their hearts. Although they knew that the possibility of passing the interview was very small, they did not feel disappointed.\u201cInterview, it\u2019s very simple, just watch the little boss do it once.\u201d As for how far it can be done, it\u2019s hard to say, Lao Li said with a smile,And added a sentence in my heart.\u201cIs it really that simple?\u201dHis words aroused suspicion from many people.\u201cOf course, if you don\u2019t believe me, you can go in and try it yourself later.\u201d Everyone continued to line up with a dubious attitude, and when the next batch of interviewees came out, they would ask again, and the answers they got were almost the same, but what was it? , but no one revealed it, making those who were waiting scratch their heads, but there was nothing they could do.\u2014It took a whole morning to interview several batches of people. Although most of the people who came to the interview were not qualified, one or two of them were not bad.Although the slices were very thick, at least they were strips. After all, it was the first time to cut vegetables with a knife. To be able to do this was considered a talent.However, the interview results were not directly told to them at the time, because in addition to interviewing the knife workers, they also needed to know their character, and character is obviously more important than knife skills, but Mu Chen was in charge of this. Yes, Mu Yan also trusts him very much.When all the interviews are over, the outside is already chaotic like a vegetable market, waiting for the two bosses to come out to ask if I passed\u201cEveryone has worked hard. The interview results will be posted in front of the small shop tomorrow.\u201d Mu Chen said in a cold voice, and then walked home with Mu Yan in his arms. His attitude was even bigger than that of a big-name company, but no one felt that Something is wrong.\u201cHa\u2026\u201d Mu Yan couldn\u2019t help yawning. Recently, when he is sleepy, he always wants to go to sleep.Mu Chen\u2019s pace of hugging Mu Yan quickened a bit, wishing he could directly hug him up, he must be tired after sitting for a whole morning, and he can just take a nap when he goes back.\u201cYou can sleep together too.\u201d Mu Yan pulled Mu Chen\u2019s arm and said softly.Looking at the level of hard work, it is obvious that Ah Chen is more tired, and he has only sat for a whole morning, but Ah Chen is cooking and cooking, and he is also busy, so it is even harder.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be with you.\u201d Mu Chen took off his coat, lay down on the bed, hugged Mu Yan into his arms, and gently patted his back with his big hands, as if coaxing a child to sleep.Surrounded by the familiar atmosphere, warm touch, and gentle movements, Mu Yan soon fell into a deep sleep, occasionally snoring cheerfully.\u201cGo to sleep, my baby.\u201d Mu Chen lowered his head and pressed a kiss on Mu Yan\u2019s forehead, seeing Mu Yan\u2019s peaceful sleeping face, his heart was full, feeling like he owned the whole world.It feels good to have a loved one by your side!The results of the interview came out. Tao Qingran, Li Hao, Zhao Hanyuan, Zhang Mingfei, and Liu Hu were admitted. They were all young men, not very old, and all five of them were villagers from Taohua Village.As a result, one post is posted, and the effect is no less than the announcement of the imperial list in ancient times, when several families were happy and others were sad.\u201cYoho, I\u2019ve been admitted, haha!\u201d A young man couldn\u2019t help laughing triumphantly, and was instantly mobbed by his friends.\u201cI called you Desi. It\u2019s great to be admitted, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I was in a bad mood when I lost the election, but in the end there are still people who are Dese, whoever you don\u2019t beat himWho knew that person was still straight-tempered, yelling with a straight neck: \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing. After being admitted, I will be able to eat the things made by the little boss every day in the future. Don\u2019t be too happy.\u201dThe tone of the latter was directly distorted, and the ecstasy tone knew that he was beaten again, but unfortunately no one sympathized with him.Seeing this, several other admitted people were happy and wanted to share it with the whole world, but with the lessons learned from the past, they could only hold back with all their strength, then quietly left the crowd, and went away in secret.\u201cThose who are admitted will go to work on time at 8 o\u2019clock the day after tomorrow, and they will be closed for a day tomorrow, and today they will launch a new food, Doufunao.\u201d Mu Chen simply explained a few things, and regardless of how those people reacted, he went straight into the shop and started working.The customers were still immersed in the news that the business would be closed the next day and couldn\u2019t recover, but Mu Chen smashed another big news, and the customers who smashed it were still a little confused now.\u201cWhat did the big boss say just now?\u201d A customer asked the people around him blankly, regardless of whether they knew each other before, coming here to eat can always get closer to each other quickly, even people who don\u2019t know each other can Become friends quickly.\u201cThe big boss seems to say that a new food has been added today.\u201d The man said it a step faster than his head, but his brain hadn\u2019t reacted yet.I don\u2019t know who made a sudden \u201cAow\u201d, which shocked everyone, and then saw the man who was yelling like crazy rushing into the snack bar immediately, and then said loudly: \u201cHurry up! I\u2019ll have a tofu nao.\u201dAs if awakened from a dream, other people flocked to the snack bar, but because the door of the snack bar was so wide, everyone wanted to go in first, so it became a state where everyone was crowded at the door No, no one will let anyone else.\u201cDamn, I\u2019m squeezed to death.\u201d\u201cWho squeezes me, get out of the way, out of the way!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it okay if I don\u2019t squeeze with you, let me out!The sound of howling ghosts and wolves kept coming, and it was noisy for a while, and then everyone saw Mu Chen coming out of the back kitchen with a gloomy face. In an instant, the surrounding immediately became quiet, as if someone had pressed the pause button.\u201cThe door is jammed, don\u2019t come in today.\u201d Mu Chen left a sentence and a look indifferently, instantly making everyone honest, obediently giving way to each other and queuing up to enter the store. It was impossible not to be shocked by that scene Yes, but customers who come to the snack bar have long been accustomed to it.Just a joke, there is a new food in the store today, if you can\u2019t eat it today, and the snack bar is closed tomorrow, then you won\u2019t be able to eat it for two days, this is absolutely unbearable!Although Mu Chen said that the five admitted people would come back to work the day after tomorrow, but they very consciously stayed in the small shop to help greet other customers, and immediately went to the small window connecting the back kitchen and the front hall, Then I was the first to see the new Chi Shi Yi Dou Fu Nao.The white and smooth tofu nao is like curd, and it is paired with a dark sauce. Just looking at it makes people feel appetizing, and they can\u2019t help but want to secretly taste it.\u201cBoss, is this the new Tofu Nao that was launched today?\u201d Zhao Hanyuan\u2019s eyes were firmly attached to the Tofu Nao, and he swallowed subconsciously.water.\u201cTable 10.\u201d Mu Chen said without raising his head.\u201cOkay! Deliver it right away.\u201d Zhao Hanyuan snatched the bowl of tofu nao first, then walked to table ten without looking sideways, but hesitated to put it down.Seeing this, the customer at table ten immediately snatched the tofu brain from Zhao Hanyuan\u2019s hand, fearing that the other party would steal it if he couldn\u2019t hold back.Looking at the tender tofu nao and looking at the greedy Zhao Hanyuan, the customer at table ten flicked the tofu nao in front of Zhao Hanyuan in a vicious manner, and said meanly: \u201cDo you really want to eat it, but it\u2019s a pity that this is Mine, you can\u2019t eat it, haha\u2026\u201dZhao Hanyuan glared at him angrily, and forced himself to return to the window quickly, so as not to beat him up in an impulse, and this good job might be ruined by then.Be patient, he will be able to eat the delicious food made by the little boss for three meals in the future, he doesn\u2019t care about this, yes, he doesn\u2019t care about it! Zhao Hanyuan kept hypnotizing himself in his mind so that he could continue his work normally. Like Zhao Hanyuan, the other waiters also hypnotized themselves without listening, otherwise the work would really be impossible.At about ten o\u2019clock, the customers in the store had almost left, and the five waiters slumped on the chairs collectively. They were not physically tired, but mentally tired.For two full hours, the delicious food has been slipping away from their eyes, seeing but not eating, everyone thinks this is a kind of torture, and they will have to endure such torture every day in the future, suddenly, the five people have a tacit understanding doubted his choice.\u2013 Bowls of fragrant tofu nao appeared in front of them, which instantly lifted the spirits of the five people.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to let you have breakfast so late today. In the future, you will come here earlier before eight o\u2019clock. After breakfast, we will open.\u201d Mu Yan said in a gentle voice, with an apology on his face.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s voluntary today, and I can eat the craftsmanship of the little boss, so I can stay here all day.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, the little boss\u2019s craftsmanship is really good.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 - Harvest the wheatPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWell\u2026it\u2019s delicious, little boss, you\u2019re really amazing.\u201d Zhao Hanyuan couldn\u2019t help but take a sip, the smooth and tender taste, the salty and fragrant soup, one bite makes one want to bite off one\u2019s own tongue.Others didn\u2019t go there well. Once they started eating, they didn\u2019t have time to talk or do anything else. They wanted to swallow all the bowls together. As for the doubts about their choice before, they had been thrown ten miles away. Now there is only one sentence left in the minds of the five people: To be able to work here, I must have saved the galaxy in my previous life.After seeing off the fluttering five people, Mu Yan and Mu Chen tidied up a bit and closed the store.\u201cThe wheat is already ripe, let\u2019s harvest it in the afternoon.\u201d Mu Yan said with a smile, feeling very satisfied with his current life.Almost all his wishes have been realized, and even those that he didn\u2019t even dare to think about before have gradually come true, and now he is only short of a baby, which makes him more complete.Mu Yan subconsciously touched his belly, not knowing when his and Ah Chen\u2019s baby would arrive.\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Chen gently embraced Mu Yan, his big hand pressed against the other\u2019s small hand on his lower abdomen, and asked softly, \u201cIs your stomach uncomfortable?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not uncomfortable.\u201d Mu Yan replied in a low voice, his face slightly glowing.red.Even though the two are already a legal couple, even though they often do intimate things, Mu Yan still has a thin skin and is easily shy.After lunch, the two of them headed towards the wheat field as soon as possible. No. 5 was flying back and forth excitedly in mid-air, flying far away quickly and then coming back again. Going back and forth was not too tiring. .\u201cFinally I can eat food made of flour, so happy.\u201d No. 5 hummed an out-of-tune song excitedly while flying.Mu Yan was also quite happy, after all, it was the first time he planted wheat with his own hands.As for Mu Chen, as long as Mu Yan is happy, he will feel very happyThe two turned a corner together, and saw a child standing by the edge of the wheat field from a distance.\u201cXiao\u2019an.\u201d Mu Yan immediately recognized the other party and shouted with a smile. \u201cBrother Ah Yan.\u201d Xiao An turned around, with a small smile on his face.Under Mu Yan\u2019s patient enlightenment, Xiao An was no longer as closed and silent as before. She talked more and gradually had a smile on her face.\u201cWhy is Xiao An here by himself? You can\u2019t go to the forest alone.\u201d Mu Yan looked at the entrance of the forest and said seriously.Xiao An immediately shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m here to watch (a) wheat.\u201d\u201cLooking at the wheat?\u201d Mu Yan was a little puzzled.Mu Chen\u2019s gaze turned to the wheat field, and he glanced around, his eyes dimmed.\u201cYang Quan said before that he would pull out brother Ah Yan\u2019s wheat.\u201d Xiao An lowered her head and said in a low voice.Once before, he overheard Yang Quan discussing with several other children about pulling out all the wheat in Brother Ah Yan\u2019s house, saying that Brother Ah Yan is not a good person, and the things he grows can confuse people and make people addicted, so they must be pulled out. Only when you drop it can you stop harming others.Yang Quan is simply lying, brother Ayan is not that kind of person, brother Ayan is a very good person.At that time, he couldn\u2019t hold back and went out to fight with Yang Quan. Although Ah Yan\u2019s brother said that good children should not fight, he really couldn\u2019t help it. That Yang Quan was really bad.In order to prevent Yang Quan from really coming to pull the wheat, Xiaoan decided to come over every day to help look at the wheat. He must not let Yang Quan spoil the wheat. These are all planted by Brother Ah Yan\u2019s hard work.Mu Yan touched Xiao An\u2019s little head lovingly, and said with a smile: \u201cThank you for your hard work, Xiao An, and thank you Xiao An for protecting the wheat. We are here to harvest the wheat today. Will Xiao An help Brother Ah Yan?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Xiao An nodded vigorously, with a surprised expression on his face\u201cBrother Yan, Yingying also wants to help Brother Yan harvest the wheat.\u201d There was a crisp sound of milk, and then a small carrot head jumped onto Mu Yan\u2019s lap.I haven\u2019t seen you for a while, Yingying has grown taller. \u201cMu Yan grinned.Said.\u201cHey, Yingying thinks the same way, Yingying really wants to say brother.\u201cYang Yingying hugged Mu Yan\u2019s thigh tightly and did not let go, her intimacy was obvious.Yang Yinghao watched his younger sister hug her thigh naturally, with envy in his eyes, but his small face was tense, showing a disgusted expression of \u201cI\u2019ve grown up, I can\u2019t be so naive\u201d.Some time ago, Yang Wenyao\u2019s family went on a trip, and they just came back. The two children have a very good relationship with Mu Yan, and they both like Mu Yan, so they went to see Mu Yan at Mu\u2019s house as soon as they came back, but they didn\u2019t. When they arrived, the two children were arguing to see Brother Yan immediately. Yang Wenyao thought that maybe the two were in the wheat field, so he planned to try his luck in the wheat field, but he did not expect to see him.\u201cI also miss Yingying, and Haohao, who has grown a lot taller.\u201d Mu Yan reached out to touch Yang Yinghao\u2019s small head, and Yang Yinghao instinctively wanted to take a step back to avoid it, but then abruptly He stopped his movements and enjoyed Mu Yan\u2019s touch.\u201cThe wheat grows really well.\u201d Lin Jiayu said looking at the wheat field. She remembered that the wheat field was still green before they went on a trip, but now it is golden yellow. It looks so beautiful.\u201cThe wheat is already ripe, and I plan to harvest them today, and after a few days they can be dried and eaten.\u201d Mu Yan said with a smile.\u201cThen we came at the right time, just in time to help Yanyan harvest.\u201cYang Wenyao said.\u201cXiao\u2019an, why are you here? Are your grandparents okay?\u201d Lin Jiayu almost didn\u2019t notice when she saw the silent boy behind Muyan.\u201cAunt Lin, Uncle Yang, grandparents are all very well.\u201d Xiao An greeted them.After all, they are from the same village, and basically they don\u2019t see each other when they look up, and it\u2019s normal to know each other.Lin Jiayu and Mu Yan sat under the tree to take care of the three children, while Mu Chen and Yang Wenyao went to harvest wheat.Although Mu Chen had great strength and could pull out the wheat directly, Mu Yan still felt sorry for him, so he exchanged the sickle from the system and showed them a demonstration.\u201cThis sickle is really easy to use. It can be cut off with one light stroke.\u201d Yang Wenyao said with a smile while holding the sickle.Mu Chen didn\u2019t say anything, he concentrated on harvesting the wheat, and looked up at Mu Yan under the tree from time to time.With the blessing of the sickle, the speed and efficiency of harvesting wheat have increased a lot. With only two people, they can harvest all in one afternoon. If it is in Muyan\u2019s world, it may take several days to harvest.\u201cIt feels really good, and I have a more fulfilling feeling than working in a factory.\u201d Yang Wenyao said with emotion as he looked at the golden wheat all over the ground.This is the first time he has harvested it by himself. It is said that these can be made into delicious things. When he thinks of these finished products, the sense of accomplishment is even higher.With the help of two strong and strong men, all the wheat has been harvested, and carefully bundled and transported to Mu\u2019s house.Mu Yan had already taken the wheat threshing machine out of the system space in advance, and put it in the yard, so he was not afraid of being seen by others, and those present were not considered outsiders.\u201cAh Chen, let\u2019s break out all the wheat today.\u201d Mu Yan said.\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Chen nodded with a smile, he never refused anything Mu Yan wanted to do.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Lin Jiayu looked at the wheat threshing machine curiously, this was the first time he had seen such a machine.\u201cAunt Lin, this is a threshing machine, which can separate the ears of wheat from the stalks.\u201d Mu Yan replied while plugging in the wire.When the machine started, Mu Yan and Mu Chen each took a handful of wheat and put it on the threshing machine to start threshing. Since it was not the first time they had done this, they became more proficient in their movements, and the wheat grains kept flying not far away. But it seemed to be restrained by some force, falling within a specific range, and after a while, there was already a layer of wheat grains on the ground.Threshing wheat is also a kind of physical work. After doing it for a while, Mu Yan felt a little backache, but he didn\u2019t say it out.\u201cMu Mu, go to the kitchen and help me get some water, I\u2019m a bit thirsty.\u201d Mu Chen said softly, then naturally took the wheat from Mu Yan\u2019s hand, and put both hands on the machine.\u201cOkay.\u201d Hearing this, Mu Yan didn\u2019t think too much, and immediately ran to the kitchen to pour a few glasses of water, gave it to Mu Chen, and distributed the rest to the others.When Mu Yan came out, Yang Wenyao had already taken his place,Threshing wheat with Mu Chen.Mu Yan didn\u2019t say anything, he gave the poured water to everyone, and then he personally held the cup for Mu Chen to the other party\u2019s lips, and naturally fed him, and Mu Chen also naturally lowered his head slightly, touching Mu Chen\u2019s cup. After speaking, the atmosphere between the two of them was warm and beautiful, and people couldn\u2019t help being envious.\u201cXiaoyu, I\u2019m thirsty too.\u201d Yang Wenyao looked at Lin Lin expectantly.good words.Lin Jiayu blushed, she couldn\u2019t imagine what Yang Wenyao was thinking, she couldn\u2019t help but feel coquettish in her heart, she is a young man who just got married, romance is natural, they even have two children, and they are still imitating others , are you ashamed?Lin Jiayu handed the cup to Yang Wenyao, obviously not intending to satisfy him.\u201cWife\u2026\u201d Yang Wenyao yelled aggrievedly, probably because the relationship between Mu Chen and Mu Yan was too tender, and he couldn\u2019t help but remind him of the feeling he had when he was in love with Lin Jiayu.Lin Jiayu had no choice but to stare at him coquettishly, and then fed the water himself. Yang Wenyao was finally satisfied, with a persistent look on his face.smile.Mu Chen glanced at Yang Wenyao lightly, and the complacency flashed in his eyes, as expected, his Mu Mu was the best.Mu Chen and Yang Wenyao were still threshing grain in the yard, Mu Yan went to the kitchen to prepare dinner, and Lin Jiayu took care of the three children.In the evening, all six of them had a delicious meal, and they were reluctant to stop until their bellies were round.\u201cBrother Yan, this is delicious, smooth and tender.\u201d Yang Yingying pointed at the finished tofu nao with an excited expression on her face.\u201cI like to eat, can I make it for you tomorrow?\u201d Mu Yan smiledSaid.\u201cYeah, Yingying likes it.\u201d Yang Yingying said in a childish voice,It\u2019s so cute that Mu Yan can\u2019t help but want to pinch it, and can\u2019t help but wonder if he will be so cute if he has a baby in the future.Then, he would often be blushed by his own imagination, and Mu Chen couldn\u2019t stop watching such wooden words.Needless to say, at night it was naturally another round of tender loving care, and I didn\u2019t go to sleep until very late.\u2014It\u2019s almost nine o\u2019clock after waking up, Mu Yan is no longer as anxious as before, now there are five waiters in the snack bar, and there is also a small waiter for takeaway, Ah Chen will not be as busy as before .Get up and wash, get dressed unhurriedly, and then walk to the snack bar.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even though there are five waiters helping, it still seems very busy.Five people came and went, and there was almost no time to stop and rest, which was enough to show how popular the snack bar was.Mu Yan has never put on the airs of the boss, he will do many things in the store himself, seeing that everyone is so busy, he is naturally not idle, and hastily entered the back kitchen.Now there is only Mu Chen in the back kitchen, but this one can stand up to ten others. I can see that the other party\u2019s hands are moving quickly, and a bun can be wrapped in almost a few seconds, and the movement of filling the tofu is also smooth, without delay , every second will not be wasted, and the hand is so fast that you can only see a shadow, which makes people sigh.Mu Chen discovered Mu Yan\u2019s existence immediately, and quickly filled him with a bowl of tofu nao, and took out a few freshly steamed buns from the steamer, put them on a plate and handed them to Mu Yan.\u201cCome here to eat something first.\u201d Mu Chen pulled Mu Yan to sit on the empty table specially reserved in the back kitchen.\u201cBoss, is the tofu nao at table five ready?\u201d\u201cBoss, table eleven wants ten buns.\u201d\u201cbig boss\u2026\u201dThe waiters started calling Mu Chen at the window, but Mu Chen didn\u2019t seem to hear him, he helped Mu Yan clean the table, and then brought all the food, with a doting smile on his face from beginning to end .\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, go get busy first, I\u2019ll help you after I finish eating.\u201d Mu Yan also heard the shouts, a little embarrassed, and hurriedly said to Mu Chen.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, eat slowly, eating too fast is not good for your health.\u201d Mu Chen instructed carefully.\u201cI see.\u201d Mu Yan lowered his head and started to eat, Mu Chen had no choice but to return to his post, and the gentle expression on his face instantly became expressionless.Although the waiters couldn\u2019t see all of the back kitchen, they still saw the big boss\u2019s expression on the little boss just now, and they couldn\u2019t help but twitch their mouths when comparing it to the current one.This differential treatment, don\u2019t be too obvious, hey!Although Mu Chen told Mu Yan not to eat too fast, but the store was so busy, he couldn\u2019t enjoy the breakfast slowly, so he had to finish it in a hurry, and then went outside to help serve the dishes, after all, Chen was alone in the back kitchen Will suffice.\u201cBoss, your tofu nao is really great. How did you come up with it? It\u2019s so delicious. My youngest daughter clamors to eat it every day. When a customer sees Mu Yan, he can\u2019t help it.\u201d Live praised.\u201cIt\u2019s the same at my house. The thing I look forward to most every day is to come here in the morning so that I can come over for breakfast.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026 If the little boss hadn\u2019t married the big boss, I would have wanted to introduce her to my son. How could such a good daughter-in-law be kidnapped by the big boss?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Everyone teased Mu Yan in a hurry, and Mu Yan blushed, but the actions of his subordinates were not delayed.For an entire hour, Mu Yan barely stopped, and together with other waiters, kept going back and forth between the customers and the back kitchen, his body was a little lacking, and he felt faintly uncomfortable.\u201cLittle boss, what\u2019s wrong with you? Why is your face so pale?\u201d Li Hao was the first to discover something was wrong with Mu Yan.\u201cLittle boss, go and take a rest, we are still here, and there are not many customers now, so we won\u2019t be as busy as before.\u201d Tao Qingran persuaded.\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Mu Yan waved his hand, wanting to say that I\u2019m fine, but before he finished speaking, he felt dizzy and couldn\u2019t control his body.\u201cLittle boss!\u201d The waiters and customers shouted in panic, but Mu Yan felt that those voices were gradually getting farther and farther away from him, and his consciousness gradually became blurred. In the last bit of consciousness, there was only a familiar and A warm embrace, and then completely plunged into darkness.After waking up again, Mu Yan found that there was a circle of people around his bed, and everyone\u2019s faces were full of worry and faint joy.\u201cYanyan, you\u2019re awake, do you feel uncomfortable?\u201d Lin Jiayu stood by the bed and asked worriedly.Mu Yan shook his head, recalling the previous events, he didn\u2019t know why he suddenly passed out.Mu Chen was still talking to Dr. Li, when he heard that Mu Yan woke up, he immediately came to the bed, holding Mu Yan\u2019s little hand, the worry and guilt in his eyes almost materialized.\u201cI\u2019m fine, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Mu Yan comforted Mu Chen with a smile.Seeing this, Yang Wenyao and others thoughtfully left space for the couple, and took Dr. Li out together.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t take good care of you.\u201d Mu Chen blamed himself, thinking of what Dr. Li said just now, he wanted to punch himself hard.He fainted because of overwork. His body was weak and he was malnourished before. He needed careful adjustments. He must pay more attention to rest in the future. \u201cDr. Li\u2019s words kept echoing in his ears.I worked in the field for a whole day yesterday, and after I came back, I threshed wheat grains and made dinner again. As a result, I was tossed and tossed by him for a long time before I fell asleep. Today, I got up early and kept busy in the store. Such a high-intensity operation, Coupled with poor health, how could he not faint.Thinking of this, Mu Chen wished to go back in time, he would never let Mu Mu do a little bit of work, and at the same time he blamed himself for not discovering these problems earlier, otherwise such a situation would not have happened.\u201cNo, you took good care of me, I feel very happy.\u201d Mu Yan said with a smile, meeting Ah Chen was definitely the happiest and luckiest thing for him.\u201cMu Mu, I will definitely be more careful and take care of you more carefully in the future. Thank you for coming to my side.\u201d Mu Chen hugged Mu Yan into his arms and hugged him tightly, as if he was embracing the whole world. world.Mu Yan also stretched out his hands to hug him back. For him, he was also full of gratitude for meeting Ah Chen.\u201cMumu, we are going to be fathers.\u201d Mu Chen said in a trembling voice, until now he has not been able to recover from the news, God knows how shocked he was when he heard the news from the doctor himself.Mu Yan paused for a moment when he heard the words, and asked uncertainly after a long time: \u201cYou\u2026what did you say?\u201d\u201cMu Mu, we are going to be fathers,\u201d Mu Chen rarely showed a silly smile, and gently covered Mu Yan\u2019s belly with his big hands, and said, \u201cThere is our baby here.\u201dAlthough he knew Mu Yan\u2019s life experience and knew that Mu Yan could conceive and have children, hearing it with his own ears was a different feeling. The indescribable sense of happiness wrapped him tightly, making him wish he could tell the whole world right now. Announced that he was going to be a dad soon.Mu Yan stretched out his small hand to caress the lower abdomen in a daze, is there a baby here? Do you have a baby with him and Ah Chen?After a long time, Mu Yan finally came to his senses, with the most beautiful and happiest smile on his face, his wish was finally coming true, and in less than a year, all the wishes that he never dared to think of before had come true .Really happy.The crystal tears look more clear under the sunshine, these are tears of happiness.No one except the two of them knew how stupid the two expectant fathers were in the bedroom, while in the yard, other people who also knew the news were still in a daze.Although men and men can also get married in this world, it is still difficult to have children. Some planets with relatively advanced technology and medical care can still train children through hospitals, but there is no such condition on their planets.Therefore, even though there are male-male families on this planet, they are all destined to have no offspring. In the end, they found a special case, and they were still pregnant with a man. This is definitely the first time I have heard of such a situation. They will never believe it when they see it with their own eyes.\u201cDoctor Li, are you sure you have not made a wrong diagnosis?\u201d Yang Wenyao still couldn\u2019t believe it, which completely overturned his thinking.Although it was hard for Dr. Li to imagine, he still felt very angry when his profession was questioned.\u201cOf course, I have diagnosed three times, and the result is the same. If you are worried, you can go to other people for diagnosis. The result will not change.\u201cBut\u2026 it can be said that he is a boy.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with boys? There are all kinds of wonders in the world. Men and men can cultivate children in hospitals, but why is it impossible to conceive? If men can also have an environment to conceive children in their bodies, men all over the world can. Pregnant.\u201d Dr. Li said angrily, the previous acceptance turned into support under Yang Wenyao\u2019s questioning\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Yang Wenyao wanted to say something, but was immediately interrupted by Dr. Li.\u201cInstead of wondering why he was able to get pregnant here, it\u2019s better to find a trustworthy gynecologist. After all, he was pregnant with a man\u2019s body. The less people know about this, the better. Although I am a doctor, after all It\u2019s not an obstetrician, I don\u2019t know much about it, and when he gives birth, he will still need an obstetrician.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you, Dr. Li, and please trouble Dr. Li.\u201d Lin Jiayu grabbed her husband, then calmed Dr. Li\u2019s emotions with a kind voice, and sent him out of Mu\u2019s house.After waiting in the yard for a long time, Lin Jiayu and Yang Wenyao returned to the bedroom, and then saw the two expectant fathers hugging each other with silly faces.After a period of precipitation, the two have accepted Mu Yan\u2019s pregnancy well. After all, this is a matter between Mu Chen and Mu Yan. As long as Mu Chen doesn\u2019t mind, what right do others have to mind?\u201cAh Chen, Dr. Li just told me to find an obstetrician and gynecologist as soon as possible. When Yan Yan gives birth, it is better to have someone to deliver the baby. If it is sent to the hospital for delivery, as Yan Yan is a boy, I am afraid that it will be difficult for her to give birth. It caused a lot of unnecessary trouble, so\u2026\u201d Lin Jiayu said with cautious words.They can accept Mu Yan\u2019s pregnancy, but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone can accept it. If they go to the hospital to give birth, this secret will definitely be known to many people, and how others will think of Mu Yan.Even if they don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s opinions, those people in the research institute might try their best to get Mu Yan to experiment. After all, it is very rare for a man to have children in this era.Lin Jiayu was able to think of this, but Mu Chen couldn\u2019t think of it. Naturally, he would not allow such a thing to happen.\u201cSister Lin is right, but I don\u2019t have any memories of the past, and I don\u2019t know the people here. I don\u2019t know if Sister Lin has a suitable candidate?\u201d Mu Chen said modestly.Lin Jiayu and his family rescued Mumu, and treated them very well, they were trustworthy, so naturally the person they introduced was also trustworthy.\u201cI have one candidate, Xiaoan\u2019s grandma. Although grandma Qiao has retired, she used to be the head of the obstetrics and gynecology department. Her medical skills are absolutely trustworthy, and grandma Qiao is not the kind of person who can make irresponsible remarks, so don\u2019t worry. I will tell the matter about Yanyan and let her take care of Yanyan, I think it is okay.\u201d Lin Jiayu said.Mu Chen pondered for a while, nodded, and decided to visit Grandma Qiao in person when he had time. Everything now is not as important as Mu Yan and the baby.Lin Jiayu also winked, knowing that the two new fathers must have a lot to say to each other at this time, so she pulled Yang Wenyao and the two children out of Mu\u2019s house, leaving space for the young couple.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 - There's a new member in the familyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cMumu, is there anything else that feels uncomfortable?\u201d Mu Chen rarely sat nervously by the bed, asked anxiously and worriedly, fidgeting.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Mu Yan replied with a sweet smile, with his hands still on his lower abdomen and stroking, with a happy smile on his face.\u201cIf there is something uncomfortable, you must tell me immediately, do you know? I don\u2019t have experience in this field, and I may do it very badly, but if you tell me, I will definitely change it.\u201d Mu Chen said seriously, He stared at Mu Yan closely, unwilling to let go.Being able to have Mu Yan already made him feel that his life was complete, but he didn\u2019t expect to give him such a big surprise, and instantly made him feel that he was definitely the happiest man in the world.Soon, their small family will add a new member, and it will become more complete and happy. He will definitely work harder to give his lover and child a better and more comfortable living environment.Mu Chen took off his coat and lay down on the bed, hugged Mu Yan and the quilt in his arms, and carefully avoided the abdomen.The two just hugged each other without saying a word, but the atmosphere became more and more warm, and the sense of happiness continued to spread between the two. Slowly, until both of them fell asleep, the warm and happy atmosphere was overwhelming. Can\u2019t go away for a long time.The next day, as a matter of course, Mu Chen firmly rejected Mu Yan\u2019s plan to help in the store.After all, Mu Yan is different now, he still has one in his stomach, and he fainted yesterday because of overwork and almost gassy tires, and Mu Chen dare not let him do even a little thing, all the housework and All labor was contracted by him alone.Mu Yan felt that this was a bit exaggerated. After all, in their world, it was normal for brothers to be pregnant, and they would not be so cautious. Pregnant brothers were everywhere doing housework, and children were not so fragile.However, being so nervous and pampered by Mu Chen, Mu Yan still felt extremely heartwarming and touched, so in order not to make him worry, he could only be offered up.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go to the store to accompany you, I\u2019m bored at home alone.\u201cMu Yan said coquettishly, his voice was soft and tender, Mu Chen couldn\u2019t stand him like this.The number five who was ignored from the beginning to the end: \u00a0\u2026\u201cThen what am I? Am I invisible? With me by your side, how could you be bored?\u201d No. 5 said to Mu Yan with aggrieved and mournfulIt\u2019s a pity that Mu Yan and Mu Chen continued to ignore No. 5 unanimously, and they only had themselves in their eyes.\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Chen rubbed Mu Yan\u2019s little head, and responded dotingly.Transparent Number Five: \u2026\u201cHey\u2026 I\u2019m so pitiful. After Yan Yan has a little master, I don\u2019t want me anymore. I\u2019m out of favor, woo\u2026\u201dMu Yan raised his head and waved to No. 5, then hugged it into his arms and smoothed its fur.\u201cI still like you very much.\u201d Mu Yan said seriously, with a kind smile on his face, just like looking at his own child.Number five was immediately happy, but the good times didn\u2019t last long. He was quickly grabbed by another big hand and thrown out. If he hadn\u2019t reacted in time, he might have been smashed into a broken ball.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Number Five glared at the culprit angrily.\u201cMu Mu is pregnant, so she can\u2019t touch things with fur.\u201d Mu Chen replied coldly.\u201cI can\u2019t shed my hair!\u201d Number Five went crazy.\u201cIt\u2019s hairy if it doesn\u2019t fall off, stay away from Mu Mu in the future.\u201d Mu Chen warned.No. 5 wanted to step forward to give Mu Chen a few paws, but unfortunately he couldn\u2019t beat him, so he could only silently swallow his grievances, and every time he looked at Mu Yan, he looked like an abandoned widow.\u201cAh Chen, number five is very good.\u201d Mu Yan couldn\u2019t help interceding for number fiveNo. 5\u2019s eyes lit up immediately, as expected, it was indeed its chosen host. \u201cMumu, you are pregnant now, and you need to pay extra attention. Although I know that men in your area can also become pregnant, there is no such precedent here, so I don\u2019t know how to take care of you. All possible dangers are killed in the cradle, if something really happens to you, I will never forgive myself.\u201d It is rare for Mu Chen to say so many words at once, but the meaning inside and outside the words are all Full of deep worry and tension.It was also the first time for Mu Yan to see Mu Chen like this, which made him very distressed. He immediately hugged him, imitating how he used to coax himself, and gently patted his back with his small hands to comfort him.\u201cAchen, I will take good care of myself and the baby. If you don\u2019t let me do it, I won\u2019t do it in the future. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dThe two embraced each other, and the warm atmosphere did not allow a third party to intervene. Seeing this, No. 5, whose eyes were still shining, seemed to be cast a shadow, and looked really sad.Damn Mu Chen, my great No. 5 is at odds with you! ! Therefore, No. 5 attributed all the mistakes to Mu Chen. Anyway, from its point of view, the little host was completely bewitched by that big villain Mu Chen, so he ignored himself. Everything was Mu Chen\u2019s fault. wrong! Although No. 5 couldn\u2019t get close to Mu Yan, he still dutifully flew not far from him.Because of Mu Yan\u2019s pregnancy, Mu Chen\u2019s opening was much later that day. When they arrived at the snack bar, they found that many customers were already waiting at the door.\u201cBig boss, little boss, you guys are here. I thought you were going to release pigeons today.\u201d A customer breathed a sigh of relief when he saw Mu Chen and Mu Yan.They can eat later, but if they can\u2019t, it\u2019s really torture.\u201cI told you that the bosses will come. If there is no notice in advance, it will definitely not be closed.\u201d Zhao Hanyuan said to other customers.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve been delayed by something today.\u201d Mu Yan apologized in embarrassment.Mu Chen ignored those customers, took care of Mu Yan carefully to prevent him from being squeezed by other people, then took out the key and opened the door.Customers squeezed into the small shop in an instant, scrambling for seats, fearing that if they were a step too late, they would have to wait for a while.All the places are crowded, only the area where Mu Chen protects Mu Yan consciously leaves some distance, probably because Mu Chen\u2019s aura is too strong, no one dares to move closer to them.Mu Chen led Mu Yan to a table closest to the back kitchen, and let him sit there.\u201cYou just sit here, if you are bored, tell me, I\u2019ll let Xiao An come over to accompany you.\u201d Mu Chen told some things carefully, then called five waiters over, told them some things, and then left Into the back kitchen.The customers saw that Mu Yan didn\u2019t go to the back kitchen, but sat in the lobby instead. Although they found it strange, some regular customers chatted with him one after another while waiting, and the time passed was not boring.After the snack bar\u2019s business hours passed, Mu Chen sent Mu Yan home, told him to rest first, and then took Xiao An to Grandma Qiao\u2019s house.Mu Yan sat on the rocking chair in the yard basking in the sun, and lived a very comfortable life.\u201cYanyan, when will the little master come out?\u201d No. 5 asked curiously, keeping his eyes on Mu Yan\u2019s flat stomach, it\u2019s hard to imagine that there is already a little master inside, it\u2019s impossible to tell, okay?Mu Yan lovingly touched his flat belly, and said with a smile, \u201cIt will take another eight or nine months.\u201dWhen the doctor concluded that he was pregnant, he had been pregnant for more than a month, but he really didn\u2019t realize that the baby came to him so soon.\u201cIt\u2019s still so long.\u201d No. 5 sighed, imagining the scene of the birth of the little master who looked like Yan Yan.Now his host is occupied by that big villain Mu Chen, and it doesn\u2019t have much time to get along with the little host. After the little host is born, it must occupy the little master and spend more time with the little host.Of course, the idea of No. 5 is very beautiful, but it is uncertain whether it can be realized or not.While basking in the sun, Mu Yan chatted with No. 5, and soon there was a familiar sound of footsteps at the door. Mu Yan knew that it was Mu Chen who had returned, so he immediately sat up and looked towards the door with a smile.Sure enough, a few seconds later, the door was opened, and Mu Chen\u2019s tall figure appeared at the door, followed by Xiao An and a strange old man.\u201cMu Mu.\u201d Mu Chen came to Mu Yan\u2019s side at the first time, and was relieved when he saw that there was no uncomfortable expression on his face.\u201cBrother Mu Yan.\u201d Xiao An also ran over.A child\u2019s mind is always very sensitive, since Mu Yan has been sitting still in the morning, he has felt a little unusual, and has been worried that something is wrong with Mu Yan\u2019s brother, until Mu Chen took him to find his grandma , he was even more afraid.\u201cYou are Mu Yan. Thank you very much for taking care of Xiao An during this time. This child rarely gets along with others, but it can be seen that he likes you very much. He will tell me about you every day when he comes home.\u201d Qiao Grandma said kindly.Grandma Qiao looked older, her hair was gray, but her body was very strong, she was obviously a very healthy old man.Grandma Qiao stepped forward and grabbed Mu Yan\u2019s arm, and felt her pulse.With the development of the times, all kinds of medical facilities are very complete, and the skill of taking the pulse of traditional Chinese medicine is rarely mastered by doctors.But Grandma Qiao is a very nostalgic person. She likes Chinese medicine very much, so she usually has her own knowledge of Chinese medicine. However, many books about Chinese medicine have been lost in the trend of history, so there is not much to learn, but compared Other doctors can already be regarded as masters of Chinese medicine.It didn\u2019t take long for Grandma Qiao to show a surprised expression on her face, but she soon returned to a kind smile.\u201cI\u2019m indeed pregnant, and I\u2019m still a very healthy little guy.\u201d Grandma Qiao said with a smile.The elderly always have a natural love for children. Even though the fact that a man is pregnant has a great impact on people, they still cannot resist the charm of children.Of course, Grandma Qiao is also a person of the new era, and she has a strong ability to accept strange things.\u201cGrandma, do you mean that brother Mu Yan is going to have a baby?\u201d Qiao An blinked and asked Grandma Qiao, but her eyes were on Mu Yan\u2019s abdomen.For children, it is a very happy thing to have a baby. They don\u2019t care about the fact that the person who gave birth is a man. They only know that there is a baby.\u201cYes, in a few months, there will be a new member here, so don\u2019t always cling to your brother Muyan, he needs more rest.\u201d Grandma Qiao taught patiently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 - ObstetricsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWell, I\u2019ll take care of Brother Mu Yan.\u201d Qiao An clenched her fists tightly and nodded her head very seriously, her appearance was extremely cute.\u201cEvery half a month, I will come over to help him check, but I need some professional equipment, and I need a quiet room with a good environment for production, and I also need some special equipment, which is definitely not possible in his case. Those who go to the hospital to deliver babies can only stay at home, and I will write you the equipment I need later.\u201d Grandma Qiao made serious arrangements, and she has always been serious when it comes to her field.Mu Chen also listened very carefully, without missing a single word. After getting the equipment list, he immediately started to purchase the equipment.Recently, Mu Chen has been very busy every day, and Mu Yan always feels very distressed when he sees it.Because Ah Chen is not only busy buying equipment, but also has to take care of the daily opening of the snack bar. Although the wheat has been threshed with the help of Uncle Yang, Ah Chen is doing all the cleaning and drying by himself. There are a lot of things to do to cultivate rice seedlings. Sometimes he wants to help, but Ah Chen will immediately stop him nervously, lest he get a little bit tired.It feels good to be protected and loved by others, but he will also feel sorry for Ah Chen.Mu Yan had persuaded Mu Chen to close the snack bar several times, but Mu Chen disagreed. After all, buying medical equipment now requires a lot of credits, and they only have income from the snack bar. No matter how you look at it, it is impossible to close it. dropped.\u201cThen don\u2019t plant rice for now, or you will often go to the fields in the future.\u201d Mu Yan suggested again.Mu Chen thought about it, and thought it made sense, when Mu Mu\u2019s belly was getting bigger and bigger, he must be worried about letting him stay at home alone, and go to the field by himself, so he might as well not plant rice now.As a result, all other original jobs were retained, and only rice planting was accepted and agreed by Mu Chen to be stranded.Mu Yan and Mu Chen basically didn\u2019t use much of the income from the snack bar before, so they also accumulated a considerable amount. It\u2019s just that after purchasing medical equipment, they went back to before liberation, but Mu Chen didn\u2019t pay much attention. I don\u2019t regret it.Everything else can be saved, but these equipment must not be saved, and the things for Mu Yan must be the best, so that he can rest assured.\u2014\u2014Seven months have passed in a blink of an eye, and Mu Yan\u2019s belly is becoming more and more obvious like a bulging balloon, and Mu Chen\u2019s spirit has reached an unprecedented level of tension. Mu Yan.Don\u2019t let Mu Yan touch anything, many times, before Mu Yan\u2019s needs are expressed, Mu Chen has already taken care of everything, and just let him lie on the bed all the time, wanting to hug him away when he gets out of bed.After the past few months of training, I have gained a lot of weight, and my whole body is so lazy that it is going to mold.Because a man is pregnant, it is still a very rare thing on this planet, so when the belly can no longer be covered with clothes, Mu Yan simply stays at home and does not go out.And Mu Chen, a wife-protecting madman, naturally wouldn\u2019t let Mu Yan stay at home bored by himself, he would only go out when the snack bar opened in the morning, and stay at home with Mu Yan at other times.If it wasn\u2019t for the system upgrade task, I\u2019m afraid Mu Chen wouldn\u2019t even be willing to go to the snack bar.Although Mu Yan hasn\u2019t been in the kitchen for a long time, thanks to Mu Chen\u2019s efforts, the system has now been upgraded to level five. It is Yangchun noodles and spring rolls.With the help of the recipe, Mu Chen mastered it quickly and finished it within five months.After the system was upgraded to level five, several functions were added, one of which is that the increase of customers can be converted into points, that is to say, for every additional customer, the system can get one more point, but this part of points is separate, It is different from the previous points for debts, and the specific effect is still unknown for the time being.The lucky draw opportunities have been accumulated twice, and they will be drawn after Mu Yan gives birth.Generally speaking, everything is going smoothly, because the variety of food has increased and there are more and more customers, the snack bar has gradually become a little overwhelmed. If it is not because Mu Yan has not yet produced, I am afraid that according to the progress, they have already started to eat again. The scale of operation has been expanded.However, after Mu Yan has a baby, maybe their snack bar will continue to expand. After all, Mu Yan\u2019s goal is to let people all over the world recognize food and its charm.During this time, Lin Jiayu would often come to visit, especially instructing Mu Yan on matters during pregnancy. Without his father here to teach him, Mu Yan could only listen to Lin Jiayu\u2019s guidance seriously. Fortunately, And Aunt Lin, otherwise he might not pay attention to many things.During Mu Yan\u2019s pregnancy, Mu Chen cleaned up all the inside and outside of the house, and covered many corners and corners with thick anti-collision film to prevent Mu Yan from accidentally falling and touching them.Mu Chen also specially cleaned out a baby room, all the things in it were decorated by the two of them by themselves, it is full of childish fun and warm at the same time.The family has also added a lot of things for babies, such as baby carriages, cribs, and many cute baby clothes. Both of them are waiting for the arrival of this baby with great anticipation.\u201cDid the baby kick you today?\u201d Mu Chen sat on the wooden chair in the yard, holding Mu Yan in his arms, and gently covered the other\u2019s high belly with his big hands.Mu Yan shook his head and said, \u201cBaby is very good, he didn\u2019t kick me.\u201dWhen he felt the fetal movement for the first time, Mu Yan was very pleasantly surprised. Although he had no experience, he used to hear people in the village mention pregnancy, and he knew that the baby would move after a certain period of time, so he felt it that time. Although his stomach hurt a little from being kicked, he was still very happy and very happy to share the good news with Ah Chen.Mu Chen is naturally also very happy that the child has moved, but every time he sees Mu Yan being kicked, he will feel a little pain, and the joy will be diluted immediately, and sometimes he will even severely criticize the baby in his stomach, but he is always rejected. Mu Yan stopped it gently.\u201cGrandma Qiao will come over to check you in a while, and I will always accompany youlooking at you. \u201cMu Chen said softly.\u201cYeah.\u201d Mu Yan smiled sweetly.Recently, the smile on his face has never disappeared. He is accompanied by his lover and his children feel it. He feels that he is the happiest person in the world.Sure enough, not long after, there was a knock on the door, and then Mu Chen walked in with Grandma Qiao, and together they came to the modified production room.The production room was refitted by Mu Chen himself according to Grandma Qiao\u2019s request. It was used during Mu Yan\u2019s production, and it would also be here during normal inspections. It is filled with various advanced medical equipment, which can be regarded as a small clinic.Mu Yan was lying on his back on the bed, and Grandma Qiao skillfully connected various equipment to his body, and next to it was a huge screen, which was used to observe the situation of the baby in the womb.Every time he does an examination, Mu Yan\u2019s gaze is fixed on the screen, and he looks curiously at the growth of the baby in his womb.When he saw it for the first time, he was very shocked by the technology of this world. Although he knew from the beginning that this world was much more advanced than theirs, he did not expect it to be so advanced that even the appearance of an unborn baby in his stomach could not be seen. It can be seen that although it is a little blurry, the feeling is really amazing.Two beeps, and a corresponding image appeared on the big screen. A small person was curled up in a small film. Because the space was too small, the fetus was almost curled up into a ball, and it was hard to see him clearly. The facial features, but the hands and feet can be separated, but it looks a little awkward.But in the eyes of the new father, these awkwardnesses are cute, not only cute but also cute.\u201cWell, the baby\u2019s condition is very healthy, and the expected date of delivery will be reached in more than a month. From now on, it will be checked once a week to prevent any problems. Yanyan, if you feel any discomfort, you must let Ah Chen immediately Go and inform me, don\u2019t you know it yourself?\u201d Grandma Qiao told Mu Yan seriously.Everyone has to be more cautious as it gets to the end. She has never delivered a man before, so she doesn\u2019t have any experience, so she can only do more frequent checkups, and then find out a delivery plan.\u201cI will pay attention, thank you Grandma Qiao.\u201d Mu Yan thanked obediently.\u201cWhy don\u2019t the snack bars be closed during this time, there\u2019s only one month left, I don\u2019t worry about you.\u201d Mu Chen said to Mu Yan, if he could, he wished he could stick to it 24 hours a day, all the time. Mu Mu\u2019s body, not letting him leave his sight for even a second.****Central Star Chiang House****\u201cZhiyang, where do you think Ah Chen will be now?\u201d Zheng Xueyan asked her husband with a sad face.Although she always looks very confident, she is very worried in her heart. She knows her son\u2019s ability. There are not many people in the entire Federation who can defeat him, but this does not mean that he is not in danger. , On the contrary, there are countless people who want to put him to death. No matter how powerful an individual is, he will suffer when he meets a team.It\u2019s been almost a year, and I don\u2019t know where her Ah Chen is now, how is he doing?He lived a life of rich clothes and good food since he was a child, but suddenly he has nothing, and he doesn\u2019t know if he can adapt to it.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he is a child of the Jiang family, and he will be fine.\u201d Jiang Zhiyang hugged his wife and comforted him.\u201cBut it\u2019s been almost a year\u2026\u201d Zheng Xueyan worriedSaid.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, even if the entire Federation is turned over, he will definitely be found.\u201d Jiang Zhiyang said firmly.Zheng Xueyan sighed, how easy it is to turn the federation over. You must know that the federation has a huge scope, and there are thousands of planets alone. It also takes a lot of time.\u201cSecond Master, Second Madam, the Eldest Master of the Mu family brought Miss Mu to see him.\u201d A servant stepped forward and reported respectfully.Zheng Xueyan frowned slightly, her impatience could not be concealed.\u201cWhat is she here for?\u201d Zheng Xueyan said with a little disgust.\u201cLet\u2019s go and have a look first.\u201d Jiang Zhiyang said.\u201cHmph, when Ah Chen was here, she used to run here every day, treating this place as if she were at home, but now Ah Chen has been missing for almost a year, and the number of times she comes here can be counted on the fingers of one\u2019s fingers.\u201d Zheng Xueyan was very dissatisfied.She dislikes such a woman who is obedient and contradictory, and she doesn\u2019t know how she was blind to choose such a fiancee for Ah Chen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although the Jiang family is much higher than the Mu family in terms of family status, the relationship between the two families is not bad. ofMu Yanran.At first, the Jiang family wanted Mu Yanran to get engaged to Jiang Yuxi, the boss of the Jiang family, but unfortunately the boss of the Jiang family disagreed, so they asked several other juniorsWhen it comes to marriage choices, the Jiang family is very open-minded and respects the choices of the younger generation. Therefore, when several other people disagreed with the marriage, Mr. Jiang wanted to give up, but Mu Yanran directly took a fancy to Jiang Chenxi. Also let grandpa help him matchmaking.Later, Mr. Jiang asked Jiang Chenxi for his opinion. Jiang Chenxi had an indifferent attitude towards marriage. For him, it was the same with whomever he married. become the object of marriage.At that time, Zheng Xueyan still liked Mu Yanran quite a lot. This little girl was pretty, and she could coax people with her mouth. She often came to Jiang\u2019s house to sit and coax Zheng Xueyan into a smile every time, so she liked her even more. .If it wasn\u2019t for Jiang Chenxi\u2019s accident this time, she might still be deceived by this little girl\u2019s hypocrisy.Thinking of this, Zheng Xueyan felt sick to her stomach.Jiang Zhiyang took his wife\u2019s hand and came to the living room. In fact, he was also very dissatisfied with Mu Yanran, but as a child of a big family, the first thing he had to learn was to control his emotions, not to mention that the person in front of him was still their in-laws .When the two came to the living room, Mu Dehai and his daughter Mu Yanran were sitting on the sofa. Seeing Jiang Zhiyang and Zheng Xueyan coming down, they hurriedly stood up with smiles on their faces.\u201cI wonder what the two of you are here for?\u201d Jiang Zhiyang asked directly.Mu Dehai is handsome and has an extraordinary temperament, but compared with Jiang Zhiyang, who is from a top family, he is still a bit inferior. Facing Jiang Zhiyang at this moment, he can\u2019t help but feel weak, and put a flattering smile on his face, saying: : \u201cWe want to take care of nephew Ah Chen, do you know where he is?\u201d\u201cNot yet, but we are already sending people to look for him. As long as he is still alive, my Jiang family will definitely be able to find him.\u201d Jiang Zhiyang said firmly.Mu Dehai and Mu Yanran looked at each other, and there was a flash of light in their eyes.\u201cAt the beginning when our two families got married, the little girl was very happy. She liked A Chen very much since she was a child, and she hoped to marry him. However, the two of them had no relationship. Seeing that the marriageable age was about to pass, Those of us who are parents can\u2019t bear it.\u201d Mu Dehai said with a frown.\u201cAs soon as Ah Chen finds them, let them get married immediately.\u201d Jiang Zhiyang said, what else could he say, although the marriage was won by the Mu family at the beginning, but the other party is a girl after all, they have been waiting for so many years, and they are delaying It\u2019s not good to go down, and Ah Chen doesn\u2019t know when he will be able to find it, which makes him feel a little guilty towards Mu Yanran.However, the guilt soon disappeared completely.\u201cBut Ah Chen doesn\u2019t know when he will be able to get it back. When the girl gets older, it will be difficult to betroth to other people, so you can see if it is possible\u2026\u201d Mu Dehai didn\u2019t finish speaking, but what did he say next? , no need to guess.Zheng Xueyan was so angry that she clenched her fists tightly, and almost couldn\u2019t hold back and threw the person out.\u201cAh Chen hasn\u2019t died yet, if you can\u2019t wait, then the engagement will be void, so you can leave!\u201d Zheng Xueyan couldn\u2019t hold back after all.Jiang Zhiyang\u2019s face darkened instantly, and he looked at Mu Dehai with a sharp gaze.\u201cAunt Zheng, I also like Ah Chen very much. I have been looking forward to marrying him. I have no choice but to. I hope Aunt Zheng can understand me.\u201d Mu Yanran said softly, her pitiful appearance made people feel sad. I can\u2019t help but feel pity in my heart.However, in the eyes of Jiang Zhiyang and Zheng Xueyan, they only felt that they were pretentious and disgusting.Seeing the expressions of Zheng Xueyan and Jiang Zhiyang, Mu Dehai immediately added: \u201cOf course the engagement between our two families will not be voided, but the little girl is getting older now, and the best age for a girl is only a few years, but the rest of our Mu family His child is no worse than Yan\u2019er, and his age is still youthful\u2026Although Mu Dehai wanted to come here to dissolve the engagement between Mu Yanran and Jiang Chenxi, but he didn\u2019t want to lose the powerful Jiang family. With the support of the Jiang family, plus that one, his patriarchal position would definitely be at his fingertips of.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say, the engagement is now void, Uncle Li, see off the guests.\u201d Jiang Zhiyang said in a low voice.Uncle Li was ordered to send away the father and daughter of the Mu family who were still chattering away. Zheng Xueyan immediately collapsed on the sofa, her face full of grief and anger.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that girl to be such a person. If I had known this, I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to her engagement with Ah Chen.\u201dZheng Xueyan covered her face and said guiltily, the guilt for her son almost overwhelmed her.Now that my son doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, it turns out that these people are still making trouble. It\u2019s really disgusting!\u201cSince he took the initiative to break the engagement with us, he must have already chosen another candidate.\u201d Jiang Zhiyang said in a low voice.Their Jiang family is one of the top families in the federation, while the Mu family is only a first-class family. Since the other party wants to break the engagement with the idea of offending them, I am afraid that the other person they hook up with will also be from a top family. But I don\u2019t know who it will be?\u201cHmph, that\u2019s good too. It saves time to marry her into the family to see what she is like. It makes it harder for Ah Chen to do it. It\u2019s just a pain for my Ah Chen.\u201d Zheng Xueyan became sad again as she spoke.Mu Chen, who is falling behind the planet, has no idea that there are people who worry about him on the distant planet, and now he lives very fulfilling and happy every day, especially when they are about to welcome their baby, This made his heart full every day.As the due date is getting closer, Mu Chen is even more nervous than Mu Yan, a pregnant woman, and keeps close to Mu Yan every day.Because she was pregnant as a man, Grandma Qiao worried that it would be difficult to deliver the baby, so she asked Mu Chen to accompany Mu Yan to exercise for a while every day to ensure that she would have sufficient strength during delivery.On this day, Mu Chen supported Mu Yan and walked slowly in the yard as usual, Mu Yan\u2019s stomach was already like a balloon bulging to the extreme, round and round, even wearing loose clothes, it could be seen that she was pregnant at a glance.Both of them were careful, and their eyes would fall on the bulging belly from time to time, because what was conceived in it was the crystallization of their love, and it was the most intimate witness of the two of them in the world.\u201cMumu, thank you for your hard work.\u201d Mu Chen said softly in a low voice.The warm breath brushed against his ears, causing a blush.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not hard, I\u2026 ah!\u201d Mu Yan replied with a red face, just halfway through speaking, he felt a sudden pain in his stomach, and couldn\u2019t help crying out.Reflexively, Mu Chen immediately picked up Mu Yan and ran towards the production room, yelling anxiously at Xiao An while running: \u201cMu Mu is about to give birth, go and call Grandma Qiao.\u201dBecause Mu Yan might give birth at any time, Mu Chen was given key education by Grandma Qiao, asking him to observe Mu Yan\u2019s situation at any time, and to call her immediately if he felt labor pains.\u201cOh? I, I\u2019ll go!\u201d Xiao An\u2019s face suddenly turned pale, and she ran out in a hurry.Ever since Mu Yan was pregnant and unable to go out, the three children, Qiao An, Yang Yingying, and Yang Yinghao, often came to chat with him. Of course, they also had a very important task, that is, when Mu Yan was about to give birth, Tip them off.Because Mu Yan and Mu Chen have no family members here, if Mu Yan is going to give birth suddenly, Mu Chen will definitely take care of Mu Yan, and he will not be able to spare time to inform Grandma Qiao and Lin Jiayu. The heavy responsibility is given to these children.When Qiao An went to inform Grandma Qiao, Yang Yinghao immediately went home and informed his parents.It didn\u2019t take long for Grandma Qiao and Lin Jiayu to enter the door one after another. Grandma Qiao immediately went to the delivery room to check on Mu Yan and confirmed that the other party was indeed about to give birth.\u201cJiayu comes with me, the others are waiting outside, Mu Chen, you go out.\u201d Grandma Qiao said seriously, and then brought Lin Jiayu into the delivery room.\u201cI want to stay here with Mu Mu.\u201d Mu Chen didn\u2019t even lift his head, all his eyes were on Mu Yan, his brows were tightly frowned, his expression forbearing\u201cYou will only add to the chaos here.\u201d Grandma Qiao said sharply.Mu Chen tightly held Mu Yan\u2019s little hand, seeing the other\u2019s painful expression, his heart tightened, wishing that he could give birth instead of him.Grandma Qiao wanted to say something more, but Lin Jiayu stopped her and shook her head at her.Grandma Qiao looked at Mu Chen looking at Mu Yan, and threw a set of disinfection clothes to Mu Chen with a cold face, and then disinfected with Lin Jiayu, preparing to deliver the baby.Although this planet is very backward and cannot compare to the medical technology on other planets, even so, it is still much more advanced than Mu Yan\u2019s world, at least the cesarean section is very mature.Although Grandma Qiao has never delivered a man before, and she doesn\u2019t know how to give birth naturally, but a caesarean section is still possible. In the previous inspections, Grandma Qiao has already determined the location of Muyan\u2019s child\u2019s organs. Caesarean section to take the baby outAt the beginning, Mu Yan still felt severe pain, but when he was carried on the operating bed and began to give birth, he didn\u2019t feel much. In addition, Mu Chen was with him all the time, which made his attention got transferred.\u201cOkay, it\u2019s a very cute baby.\u201d Grandma Qiao said in a kind voice, and then handed the child to Lin Jiayu, asking her to help clean up, while she sewed up Mu Yan\u2019s wound.Mu Yan was in a daze the whole time, the pain he imagined didn\u2019t come, and even when he didn\u2019t feel anything, the baby was bornHe used to hear people in the village talk about how painful it was during childbirth. Childbirth was like walking around the door of hell. Many people even died because of childbirth. He was prepared beforehand. , if something really happened, he would definitely keep his child.The results of it?Before I could react to anything, the baby came out, and it didn\u2019t hurt at all. This\u2026 Is this really the end of the birth?\u201cI\u2026can I see him?\u201d Mu Yan asked softly, although he didn\u2019t feel any pain, but his body was still very weak and he couldn\u2019t sit up.\u201cOf course, it\u2019s a very cute baby, Yanyan, congratulations.\u201d Grandma Qiao said to him with a smile.Coincidentally at this time, Lin Jiayu had finished cleaning the baby, and then carried him to the bedside, bent down and handed it to Mu Yan.Mu Yan watched Lin Jiayu walking towards him step by step, holding the baby wrapped in a small quilt in his hands, and suddenly felt a feeling of becoming a father for the first time in his heart.However, when he saw the baby in the swaddle, Mu Yan was stunned, his eyes were wide open, full of disbelief, he pointed to the swaddle and asked, \u201cThis\u2026was born to me?\u201d\u201cYes, you look so cute.\u201d Lin Jiayu didn\u2019t notice Mu Yan\u2019s strange behavior, and was still looking at the baby in the swaddle, smiling happily.\u201cHow, how is it possible, I\u2026 how could I give birth to\u2026 how\u2026\u201d Mu Yan was shocked and incoherent, looked at the swaddling baby, looked at Lin Jiayu and the others, everyone had a pleasant smile on their faces, which made him Very puzzled.Is it just that what he sees is different from what everyone sees? But why\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Is there something uncomfortable?\u201d Mu Chen\u2019s attention was always on Mu Yan. Seeing that Mu Yan was so shocked that he couldn\u2019t speak, he immediately became nervous.But Mu Yan seemed to have caught a life-saving straw, and immediately grabbed Mu Chen\u2019s sleeve tightly, and said in a hurry: \u201cAh Chen, look, look at our child\u2026\u201dOnly then did Mu Chen look in the direction Mu Yan pointed, and then he saw the baby Lin Jiayu was holding, and the expression on his face softened for a moment.\u201cThank you Mumu, thank you for giving birth to my baby.\u201d Mu Chen lowered his head and pressed a kiss on Mu Yan\u2019s forehead, that feeling of happiness was about to spread.\u201cNo, you\u2026 what did you see? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s strange?\u201d Mu Yan said hurriedly, feeling very uneasy in his heart. Since he was pregnant, it was the first time he felt such uneasiness and fear.He is not from this world, and he never felt that he was different from the people of this world before, but\u2026 But why did he not give birth to a humanoid baby, but a little tiger?Is it because I am not a person in this world, so I am like this? Mu Yan thought of this possibility, and thought that the baby who was harmed by him turned into a non-human monster, tears streaming down his eyes instantly.\u201cMumu, Mumu, what\u2019s wrong with you? Grandma Qiao, hurry up and see if Mumu is not feeling well?\u201d Mu Chen anxiously pulled Grandma Qiao, regardless of her age.Grandma Qiao didn\u2019t mind either, she hurriedly checked Mu Yan, and found that Mu Yan was in good health, which showed that he had been raised well during this period of time.\u201cThere is nothing wrong with the body, but I am a little emotional.\u201d Grandma Qiao said with a smile, thinking that Mu Yan was so excited when he saw the baby, but Mu Chen obviously didn\u2019t think so.\u201cMu Mu, tell me what you think, don\u2019t hold it in your heart.\u201d Mu Chen gently hugged Mu Yan, lest he press on the other\u2019s wound.\u201cAh Chen, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s all my fault\u2026 hiccup\u2026\u201d Mu Yan\u2019s tears couldn\u2019t stop, and he hiccupped uncontrollably.\u201cMumu, what happened? Can you tell me?\u201d Mu Chen asked in a very gentle voice, trying not to appear so anxious, coaxing Mu Yan patiently.\u201cAh Chen, I gave birth to a tiger. It\u2019s all because of me that the baby became like this. I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Thinking of his own child turning into a tiger, Mu Yan\u2019s heart tightened, and he blamed himself to death.Mu Chen &amp; Lin Jiayu &amp; Granny Qiao: \u2026\u201cYanyan, it\u2019s good to give birth to a tiger. No matter how many people want to give birth, Lin Jiayu also heard Mu Yan\u2019s words, and immediately replied in puzzlement.God knows how excited and surprised she was when she saw the baby. You know, this is the second time in her life that she has seen a beast-shaped baby. Mu Yan actually cried because of this.\u201cYou, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s strange?\u201d Mu Yan was very puzzled, how could it be normal to give birth to a non-human animal, how could it be what many people want to have.Only then did Lin Jiayu and Grandma Qiao realize their negligence. Mu Yan may not know that there is another kind of person in this world.\u201cYanyan, the baby is born in the shape of a beast, which means that he has the ability to transform into a beast, and he will also have supernatural powers when he grows up. This is very remarkable.\u201d Lin Jiayu carefully educated Mu Yan about this aspects of knowledge.It turns out that after humans entered the interstellar era, there was a fusion of humans and other species, and then there was a phenomenon of reversion to ancestors. Human beings with the phenomenon of reversion have not only greatly improved their abilities in all aspects, but even possessed Supernatural abilities, also known as supernatural abilities.These people with supernatural powers can not only maintain human form, but also turn into beast form. Fighting in beast form will greatly improve their combat effectiveness. Therefore, the status of supernatural beings in the Federation is very high, and the treatment they receive is also the best.If the descendants of the supernatural beings are also supernatural beings, they will be born in the shape of a beast at birth, and then turn into a human form when they are about one year old. Once such people appear in every family, they will be highly valued.\u201cSo the baby will be a supernatural being in the future.\u201d Lin Jiayu said to Mu Yan with a smile. She really didn\u2019t expect to see the animal-shaped baby again.You know, their planet is very backward. Basically, people with some money and ability will not want to live here, let alone people with supernatural powers. I am afraid that they will be taken out immediately when they are born, and Even their families will be taken to live on other planetsTherefore, there are almost no supernatural beings on their planet, and many people don\u2019t even know the existence of supernatural beings, so it\u2019s normal for Mu Yan to be unclear, in Lin Jiayu\u2019s view.\u201cReally, is that so?\u201d Mu Yan asked uncertainly, always feeling that his previous cognition had been refreshed. Can human beings still become beasts and use superpowers? so amazing.\u201cYes, Haohao can also transform into a beast.\u201d Lin Jiayu said with a smile. If Mu Yan was not very close to their family, she would not have told him this secret. After all, except for them, no one knew about it. Things, she doesn\u2019t want others to know.Mu Yan\u2019s eyes widened. Obviously, he didn\u2019t expect Haohao to turn into a small animal. What kind of animal would he be?Now, looking at the baby tiger in its infancy, Mu Yan is no longer as shocked as before, and what is left is only full of love.Weakly stretching out his hands, he hugged the little tiger into his arms. The blood connection made him feel very close, and he fell asleep holding the little tiger like this.Mu Chen didn\u2019t dare to move Mu Yan lightly, after all, just after giving birth, it would still hurt his vitality. Fortunately, when the production room was arranged, everything was the best, and the operating bed was also very comfortable, which made Mu Yan feel uncomfortable. A little nap is still ok.Lin Jiayu and Grandma Qiao packed up all the other things in the delivery room. Seeing the family of three snuggling together happily, they left the delivery room without disturbing them.\u201cYanyan is a lucky person.\u201d Grandma Qiao said in admiration. When she saw the little tiger just now, she was also very surprised. Thanks to her strong professional skills and psychological quality, she was not so surprised that she forgot that Muyan was still in production. matter.\u201cWell, I hope they can live a stable and happy life in the future.\u201d Lin Jiayu also wished sincerely.Grandma Qiao took Qiao An and left first, while Yang Wenyao\u2019s family stayed behind, planning to see if there was anything that needed help later.\u201cMom, is brother Yan born? Is little brother cute?\u201d Yang Yingying raised her little head, grabbed Lin Jiayu\u2019s sleeve, and asked.\u201cIt\u2019s a very cute little brother, and Yingying will see it in a few days.\u201d Lin Jiayu said with a smile, then turned to look at Yang Wenyao, and told him about the baby tiger cub.Yang Wenyao raised his brows slightly, obviously quite surprised, and said, \u201cIf Yan Yan gave birth to a beast-shaped baby, it means that one of them must be a supernatural being, and Mu Chen\u2026\u201dJudging from Mu Yan\u2019s reaction when he saw the little tiger, it is very unlikely that he is a supernatural being, so the only possibility is Mu Chen who has lost his memory.\u201cAyao, who do you think Mu Chen is?\u201d Lin Jiayu was a little worried. Although Mu Chen had lost his memory, his usual behavior, tone of voice, and aura on his body showed that he was not an ordinary person. I am afraid that the family background of the child will not be small.Maybe others may not think there is anything, but she has also seen those people from the upper class, even if Mu Chen is compared with those people, his performance will not be worse than them.Now he is with Mu Yan because he has amnesia, if one day he regains his memory, if he knows his family background, will he still fall in love with Mu Yan, will he leave here?In particular, Mu Yan has now given birth to a little supernatural being, and Mu Chen is likely to be also a supernatural being. Will he take the child away with him? The more Lin Jiayu thinks about it, the more frightened she becomes.\u201cOkay, don\u2019t think about it, no matter what his family background is, as long as he is good to Yan Yan, I can tell that he is sincere to Yan Yan, so don\u2019t worry about it here.\u201d Yang Wenyao embraced his wife\u2019s shoulders, comforted her.\u201cI hope so.\u201d Lin Jiayu said with a sigh.Mu Yan hugged the little tiger and fell asleep until the afternoon, but woke up to the little tiger\u2019s humming.Because of the improvement of medical level, Mu Yan\u2019s body has recovered a bit, and he is not as weak as before. Although the wound on his abdomen has not healed completely, it doesn\u2019t hurt so much anymore.\u201cAww\u2026 Aww\u2026\u201d The little tiger kept waving in Mu Yan\u2019s arms.Arched, with a small voice calling, the eyes have not been fully opened, the white hair is very soft and smooth to the touch, it makes people love it, and it looks even more cute.Mu Yan\u2019s eyes became softer. Even though he gave birth to a little tiger that overturned his previous thinking, he still loves the little tiger. After all, it came out of his stomach.Pregnant in October, the bond of blood will not change in the slightest because of the change of species.\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Mu Yan asked the little tiger warmly.Maybe because he heard his father\u2019s voice, the little tiger barked even faster, and his small body kept trying to squeeze towards Mu Yan.Mu Yan stretched out his hand to gently pat the little tiger, comforting him, struggling to hug him, and then went out to find him something to eat.Although Mu Yan is a brother, he is still a man after all, and it is impossible to produce breast milk. In their world, newborns have to eat milk fruit. When there is a pregnant brother in the family, the family will give birth early Prepare the milk fruit and feed it to the children when they are born.But it is definitely impossible to have milk fruit here, but there is something more convenient, that is milk powder.\u201cBe good, baby. Daddy will make milk powder for you. You won\u2019t be hungry in a while.\u201d Mu Yan coaxed the little tiger in a gentle voice, and then worked hard to get up to prepare it for him.The family had already prepared a lot of milk powder, some of which were prepared with the help of Aunt Lin and Grandma Qiao. I was worried that the two big men who became fathers for the first time were not thoughtful, and all the unexpected things they could think of were prepared in advance.\u201cMumu, don\u2019t move, you are not in good health yet.\u201d When Mu Chen came in with dinner, he happened to see the scene where Mu Yan wanted to get out of bed, and immediately stepped forward to support him worriedly, and then carefully lifted him back put back on the bedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You haven\u2019t fully recovered yet, so don\u2019t be too tired.\u201d Mu Chen stroked Mu Yan\u2019s forehead distressedly, and said softly.\u201cThe baby is hungry, I want to make him a cup of milk powder.\u201d Mu Yan said innocently with his eyes wide open.\u201cIt\u2019s fine if I come, you lie down.\u201d After Mu Chen finished speaking, he quickly poured a bottle of milk powder for the baby.In order to be able to take good care of the newborn baby, Mu Chen worked hard to learn from Lin Jiayu, and now he is a fully qualified baby daddy.The little tiger seemed to smell the sweet milk scent, and moved its little nose vigorously, and moved its little head towards Mu Chen\u2019s direction, whimpering and chirping very cutely.Mu Chen skillfully stuffed the bottle into the little tiger\u2019s mouth, and the little tiger immediately held the little bottle with its soft paws, lying on its back, drinking happily.\u201cThe baby is so cute.\u201d Mu Yan looked at the little tiger and couldn\u2019t help laughing.sound.\u201cYou are the cutest.\u201d Mu Chen went to the bedside, and uttered sweet words casually, and Mu Chen\u2019s thin skin immediately turned red when he heard the words.\u201cGrandma Qiao said that you just gave birth and you can\u2019t eat too much, so I made some nutritional powder paste and side dishes, you eat some first, and I will make delicious food for you when you feel better.\u201d Chen held the bowl containing the nutritious powder, scooped up a spoonful of it, blew it cool, and brought it to Mu Yan\u2019s lips, obviously wanting to feed him himself.Mu Yan\u2019s face was slightly red, and his heart was hot. He ate the nutritious powder paste one bite at a time. It was obviously tasteless, but he felt it was sweet.After dinner, Mu Chen first carried the baby back to the crib in the room, and then came back to carry Mu Yan back to their room.Before, because Mu Yan was very weak after giving birth, he stayed in the delivery room. Now that he is in better health, he carried him back to the bedroom.\u201cAh Chen, bring the baby here.\u201d Mu Yan patted the place beside him, then looked at his son lying alone on the crib waving his little paw, and said.Although Mu Chen didn\u2019t want his son to share the sleeping space between him and Mu Mu, but he always responded to Mu Yan, so he had no choice but to hug his son.Mu Yan teased the little tiger with his fingers, stroking his little pawsHe can smooth his hair, and the teased tiger cub keeps making a comfortable sound of \u201cgurgling\u201d.Mu Yan\u2019s attention was all on his son, and Mu Chen looked a bit apprehensive, and he could even predict that his son would distract most of his lover\u2019s attention in the future, and he felt heartbroken just thinking about it.\u201cMu Mu, what do you want to eat tomorrow?\u201d Mu Chen hugged his lover from behind, and whispered in his ear, the warm breath brushed against the other\u2019s earlobe continuously, causing the person in his arms to tremble.\u201cIt\u2019s all okay.\u201d Mu Yan responded in a low voice, trying hard not to make strange noises, twisting his body constantly, trying to stay away from Mu Chen.However, Mu Yan didn\u2019t know that his disturbance was even more torture for Mu Chen, and he almost couldn\u2019t help it.\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Mu Chen\u2019s voice was low and hoarse with a hint of desire, but it was even more deceptive.The two of them even have children, even if they are dull, Mu Yan also knows what Mu Chen\u2019s behavior means, so he was so scared that he didn\u2019t dare to move.In fact, he also wanted it a little bit. After all, during pregnancy, the number of times the two had **** was very few, but the baby was still here, so he couldn\u2019t set a bad example for the baby.Mu Chen hugged Mu Yan tightly, felt Mu Yan\u2019s warm body, familiar breath, and severely suppressed the desire in his body that was constantly moving around.He still kept in mind what Grandma Qiao said, that Mu Mu had just given birth and was not suitable for intercourse, otherwise the root cause of the disease would easily remain.\u201cWhen you are in good health, you have to make it up to me.\u201d Mu Chen almost gritted his teeth and said this sentence, ambiguous and bewitching, and then exchanged a long and moist kiss fiercely, and then hurriedly got up to rush I took a cold shower.Mu Yan\u2019s little face was still flushed red, and his thoughts were wandering, until he felt his son rubbing against him constantly, and then he came back to his senses.Another week later, the little tiger\u2019s eyes have been opened, the black pupils are round and bright, his personality is very lively, he runs around in the yard all day, his energy is so strong that Mu Yan can\u2019t stand it.If it was a human-shaped baby, it would definitely be lying obediently in the swaddle and being hugged at this moment. However, a beast-shaped baby can already run around all over the place. If it weren\u2019t for Mu Chen who could hold it down, he might have gone outside to have fun up\u201cQiaoqiu, breakfast is ready.\u201d Mu Yan said to the little tiger who was having fun in the yard, holding a delicious milk paste.Sure enough, as soon as the little tiger heard that there was something delicious, he was immediately attracted to him, and looked at Mu Yan with his round eyes. Can\u2019t resist.The nickname of the little tiger Qiuqiu was given by Mu Yan, because when the little tiger was just born, its whole body was curled up and looked like a fluffy ball.As for the right to name the daimyo, Mu Yan directly handed it over to Ah Chen. In his opinion, Ah Chen\u2019s knowledge is much better than his, and the name he chose must have a deeper meaning than his.Although the little tiger is already alive and kicking and having fun all over the yard, its actual age is only one month. It still mainly eats milk powder and liquid food, and can add some minced meat and vegetables in small amounts.\u201cQiaoqiu, don\u2019t be picky eaters, eat up all the green vegetables.\u201d Mu Yan put the green vegetables into Qiuqiu\u2019s exclusive small bowl, and urged.The little tiger stared at the green vegetables in the bowl with a look of bitterness and hatred, as if staring like this, the green vegetables could disappear out of thin air.Probably because of the beast\u2019s gene in his body, the little tiger always doesn\u2019t like vegetables, but for balanced nutrition, Mu Yan often asks him to eat them all, so every time the little tiger eats vegetables, it\u2019s like eating poison. Mu Yan couldn\u2019t close his mouth happily.\u201cEat it all, daddy will take you to play in the store.\u201d Mu Yan coaxed the little tiger, offering an attractive condition.The little tiger\u2019s eyes lit up suddenly, and then he began to swallow those vegetables with a big mouthful, his hairy face was wrinkled together, but he still didn\u2019t stop, which shows how strong his desire to go outside is.\u201cEat slowly.\u201d Mu Yan touched the little tiger\u2019s soft fur, and his heart became softer.After breakfast, Mu Yan followed his words and brought the little tiger to the snack bar.The snack bar has become much larger than its original size, and the number of customers it can receive at one time has nearly doubled. Even so, there are still many customers outside the door who are still waiting in line or taking packages home.As soon as Mu Yan brought the little tiger into the snack bar, he immediately became the focus of everyone\u2019s attention, and everyone greeted him warmly.\u201cLittle boss, I haven\u2019t seen you for a long time. What did you do a while ago?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t feel well a while ago, so I\u2019ve been recuperating at home.\u201d Mu Yan explained with a smile, this was also what Chen told him before, after all, it is still a relatively novel thing in this world to be pregnant as a man.\u201cIs the little boss well now? Don\u2019t be too tired.\u201d The customer asked concerned.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, thank you for your concern.\u201d Mu Yan thanked with a smile.\u201cHuh? This little tiger is so cute, is it raised by the little boss?\u201cA female customer was instantly attracted by the little tiger. Looking at the silly little tiger, she couldn\u2019t help reaching out to touch it, but unfortunately the little tiger avoided it.Qiuqiu hides behind Dad, only revealing a round head, big round eyes looking around, it looks even cuter, and a group of women can\u2019t help but call it cute.\u201cWell, his name is Qiuqiu.\u201d Mu Yan picked up the ball, worried that too many customers would accidentally squeeze or step on it.Mu Yan did not introduce to everyone that Qiuqiu is his child. Under Lin Jiayu\u2019s introduction, he also knew a lot about this planet. In order to avoid unnecessary troubles, Mu Yan did not explicitly state the existence of the author.It just so happens that the baby can\u2019t speak until it turns into a one-year-old baby, so everyone won\u2019t doubt anything.\u201cWhat a cute name, it\u2019s so cute, I want to raise one, little boss, where did you buy it?\u201d A female customer asked.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Mu Yan didn\u2019t know what to say, the thing in his arms was not bought, it was born in ten months of his hard work, it\u2019s a pity that I can\u2019t tell everyone about it.\u201cA Chen gave it to me.\u201d Mu Yan finally said, kicking the ball to Mu Chen.In fact, it is true to say that, without Ah Chen, he would not be able to conceive Qiuqiu alone, so this is not a lie.Just when the customers wanted to ask something and Mu Yan couldn\u2019t help it, Zhao Hanyuan hurried over and said, \u201cLittle Boss, Big Boss let you go.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Yan hurriedly responded, and then hurried to the back kitchen, heaving a sigh of relief.\u201cLittle boss, you\u2019re here.\u201d Zhang Mingfei greeted him with a smile, and then continued to chop vegetables.Because of the large size of the snack bar, Mu Chen is obviously too busy in the back kitchen, and Mu Yan needs to accompany the children often, so he decided to train five employees in the shop, and let them help support the snack bar in the future.In fact, Mu Yan already had such an idea when he first recruited. After all, his culinary skills will definitely be spread to the outside world. Only when everyone learns how to cook can the food be truly spread.However, at present, the selection of subjects to teach cooking skills still needs to be carefully selected, which is why they were so strict when recruiting.Now only Zhang Mingfei and Tao Qingran came to help in the back kitchen. When they found out that they could enter the back kitchen, even the mature and stable Tao Qingran couldn\u2019t help being stunned, never expecting that he would have such a good opportunity.You know, there are no chefs in this world. The snack bar has almost opened up a completely blank field, and it also allows everyone to see the vast future prospects of this field. Under such circumstances, who can master the chef first? Advanced technology will naturally be able to occupy a share of this market.It\u2019s a pity that many people have tried it, but there is no way to make the taste of Mu Yan. It can be said that as long as Mu Yan does not take the initiative to leak technology, he can almost completely monopolize the market and make a lot of money. is less.However, what is surprising is that Mu Yan plans to teach this technique to others, and has already preliminarily selected candidates. God knows how much envy, jealousy and hatred they aroused when Zhang Mingfei and Tao Qingran were selected. Even the other three waiters who came in at the same time were enviousLife.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, they had tested their character when they were recruited.And they also worked harder, in order to get Mu Yan and Mu Chen\u2019s approval earlier, they kept doing better and doing better.\u201cWooooow\u2026\u201d The little tiger kept arching in Mu Yan\u2019s arms, and yelled at the stove.\u201cQiaoqiu is good, don\u2019t move around.\u201d Mu Yan couldn\u2019t hold on anymore, and hurriedly coaxed the little tiger.When Mu Chen saw this, he was not as tender as Mu Yan, he directly took the little tiger from Mu Yan\u2019s hand, and then patted that soft little **** a few times, the little tiger immediately became honest.\u201cDon\u2019t torment your father.\u201d Mu Chen reprimanded with a sullen face.\u201cCough\u2026\u201d The little tiger yelled a few times aggrieved, which immediately made Mu Yan\u2019s heart ache.\u201cI\u2019m fine, I guess Qiuqiu didn\u2019t have enough to eat in the morning.\u201d Mu Yan hurriedlyHe excused.\u201cFrom now on, if you don\u2019t eat on time, you will be hungry, and you won\u2019t eat after the meal time.\u201d Mu Chen said with a cold face, he couldn\u2019t get used to his son.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take him out for a stroll, so I won\u2019t bother you.\u201d Mu Yan was worried that his son would continue to be reprimanded, so he hurriedly hugged the ball back from Mu Chen\u2019s arms. Just as he was about to go out, he felt a pulling force pulling him Pull back and fall into a warm embrace.\u201cDid you forget about your husband after having a son?\u201d Mu Chen whispered in Mu Yan\u2019s ear, with a hint of grievance mixed in his tone.\u201cNo.\u201d Mu Yan replied in a low voice.Mu Chen moved his face forward when he heard the words, the implication couldn\u2019t be more obviousMu Yan\u2019s face instantly turned red, and he peeked around, \u201cThere are people here.\u201dZhang qingyang and tao qingran stared at the cutting board tacitly and cut the vegetables seriously, as if they hadn\u2019t seen or heard anything, but they still couldn\u2019t help but envy them in their hearts.The relationship between the two bosses is really good, but it\u2019s a pity that they always show their affection and spread dog food in front of their single dogs.\u201cThey didn\u2019t notice.\u201d Mu Chen didn\u2019t intend to let Mu Yan go. These days, Mu Mu focused almost all of his attention on his son, and gave him very little, which made him almost like his son Jealous.Mu Yan is obviously aware of this problem, but his son is only a little over a month old, and he is still a baby, so he has no choice but to wrong his lover.When Zhang Mingfei and Tao Qingran were not paying attention, Mu Yan quickly pressed a kiss on Mu Chen\u2019s left and right cheeks, and then quickly left the snack bar with the curious Qiuqiu in his arms. The heat on his face did not cool down for a long time.It wasn\u2019t until the snack bar\u2019s business hours were about to pass that Mu Yan brought Qiuqiu back to the snack bar again. At this moment, there were not many customers in the snack bar, and Mu Chen and Zhang Mingfei could finally breathe a sigh of relief.Thanks to the help of Zhang Mingfei and Tao Qingran, the business hours of the snack bar have now been extended, and it was almost noon when it ended, so a few people ate lunch together in the store.\u201cI feel so blessed. I can eat such delicious food every day. Life shouldn\u2019t be too fulfilling.\u201d Zhao Hanyuan kept stuffing things into his mouth while sighing non-stop.Although the other friends are not as exaggerated as he is, they all think similarly to him.\u201cBy the way, have you heard? It is said that the marriage between Goddess Mu Yanran and Major General Jiang Chenxi has been cancelled.\u201d Li Hao suddenly gossiped mysteriously.Mu Chen\u2019s dark eyes suddenly flickered, for some reason, when he heard Jiang Chenxi\u2019s name, his heart trembled, although it was very weak.\u201cAh? Really? Goddess Yanran likes Major General Jiang so much. This is known by the whole Federation. How could she cancel the wedding?\u201d Zhao Hanyuan asked with wide-eyed eyes in bewilderment.\u201cIt is said that Major General Jiang has been missing for almost a year, and there is no news yet.\u201d\u201cNo way, really, our place is too backward, and we still can\u2019t connect to the Starnet. Every time there is any news, it takes a long time to know. When will the government be able to connect to the Starnet.\u201d Zhang Mingfei couldn\u2019t help complaining.Li Hao spread his hands and said, \u201cWho knows, who made us so backward here, I guess some people have to wait.\u201d\u201cMajor General Jiang? Who is that?\u201d Mu Yan asked curiously while feeding Qiuqiu and listening to Li Hao and the others gossip.\u201cMajor General Jiang is a very, very powerful person. Let me tell you, Major General Jiang Chenxi comes from the Jiang family, the top family of Central Star. He was very famous since he was a child. When it comes to major generals, it all depends on the individual, although he has such a strong background, but relies on himself to rise up, he is almost the idol of all men.\u201dAs soon as Li Hao mentioned his idol, he immediately became eloquent, telling Mu Yan everything he knew.\u201cAlso, it is said that Major General Jiang is very handsome, and the women who like him can go to several planets, but he just didn\u2019t like it. In the end, our goddess Yanran is the most powerful, and she captured the major general\u2019s heart. It\u2019s a pity They have also canceled their engagement now.\u201d Li Hao felt a little regretful.\u201cHe\u2019s really so powerful.\u201d After listening to Li Hao\u2019s description, Mu Yan automatically imagined Jiang Chenxi\u2019s image in his mind. Tall, handsome, and powerful, he was simply the type of guy most dreamed of by all brothers.If it was in the past, maybe he would still look forward to it, but now that he has Mu Chen, in his eyes and heart, Mu Chen is the most powerful and beautiful, no one can compare to him.\u201cOf course, when the alien beasts attacked, Major General Jiang led his team alone, defeated the alien beasts, and saved the Karma planet. That battle was definitely the most classic battle in history. Countless people did it for them. Crazy, it\u2019s a pity that the major general\u2019s face was not clearly captured in the video, otherwise it would definitely make people even crazier.\u201d Li Hao continued to say adoringly.\u201cI saw it too. After reading it, I really wanted to join the army. Unfortunately, the army has very high requirements for soldiers. I didn\u2019t even get into the military academy, so I had no hope.\u201d Zhang Mingfei shrugged and spread his hands.\u201cEat seriously.\u201d Mu Chen tapped his slender fingers on the table and said expressionlessly.Several young people who worshiped idols immediately shut up and ate obediently.Jiang Chenxi is an unattainable idol in their hearts, but Mu Chen is a very dignified big boss in their hearts. Just looking at him makes him feel trembling, let alone disobeying his orders. It\u2019s just asking for a dead end.This small episode was quickly forgotten by everyone. After all, this planet cannot be connected to the interstellar network. It takes many days for the news outside to be updated here, so even if they see any news, it may not be the case outside. If there is new news, they will at most just read it and pass it on, they won\u2019t take it to heart.The planting of rice, which had been delayed because of Mu Yan\u2019s pregnancy, was brought up again. Before transplanting rice seedlings, rice seedlings need to be raised, and there happened to be an open space in the backyard of Mu\u2019s house, which was used by Mu Yan to raise seedlings.In addition, the wheat harvested before is still in the bag and has not been moved, waiting for Mu Yan to make up his mind after giving birth.\u201cYanyan, can we eat flour now?\u201d No. 5 asked excitedly because of his unexpected attachment to flour.\u201cLeave a part as seeds, and the rest can be ground into flour.\u201d Mu Yan said with a smile. However, the tools for grinding flour became another problem.Although manual stone mills can be made by hand, the production of stone mills is cumbersome and cumbersome, and you will need to do it yourself, which is inefficient and laborious.In order to be able to eat food made of flour earlier, No. 5 gritted his teeth and exchanged for a flour mill to grind all the remaining wheat into flour at one time.Seeing that No. 5 is so obsessed with flour, Mu Yan steamed buns with flour that night, made scallion pancakes, and made a few side dishes to satisfy the family of four.\u201cPhew\u2026the steamed stuffed buns made of flour are really delicious. I\u2019m so satisfied.\u201d Number five spread his belly on the table, reminiscing about the deliciousness of the dinner.\u201cYeah.\u201d Mu Yan echoed, although I have never eaten food made of white flour a few times, but this time it is really delicious and satisfying. I must plant more wheat in the future, so that I can always use flour to make food. Baozi, let\u2019s make scallion pancakes.\u201cYanyan, one percent of our main task has been completed.\u201d No. 5 took the time to look at the task panel and found that the task progress bar had moved, and said excitedly.He had followed other hosts before, but unfortunately, none of them were able to complete the task to the end. Even the progress bar of the main task at the beginning took several years to advance.They systematically select hosts, and then carry out tasks together. They are all prepared for a long-term struggle. After all, they are spreading food culture to the world. This is not a goal that can be accomplished in a short period of time. Ten years, some even until the death of the host may not be able to complete the main task.That\u2019s why No. 5 was so excited when he saw the progress bar of the main task had changed.After all, it has only been bound to Muyan for more than a year, and it can complete 1% in just over a year, which is definitely considered excellent among its previous hosts.Hearing No. 5\u2019s words, Mu Yan opened the system panel, and there was a separate progress bar in the upper left corner, which was the progress bar for the main tasks of the entire system, which was different from the upgrade progress bar.This main task is a manifestation of the degree of fit between what the host does and the ultimate goal of the system. Some hosts do the upgrade task very well, and the system level is raised to a high level, but the main task is poorly completed, and even the upgrade task All completed, but only a little bit of the main task was completed.The upgrade task is to practice cooking according to the recipes provided by the system, so that the host can master the production of food as soon as possible.And the existence of the system is to promote the food culture, let more people know about the food, can taste the food, and feel the charm of the food. This is the main task. Heat and practice.\u201cYanyan, it is indeed the host I fancy. We have to work harder, and we will definitely be able to complete the main task!\u201d No. 5 said with pride, dreaming about the day when the main task is completed, and how many things he can get at that time. reward, and then couldn\u2019t help laughing out loud.\u201cEn!\u201d Mu Yan nodded vigorously, and with the encouragement of No. 5, he also felt more motivated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When he was a child, his grades in school were mediocre, and he often went to the bottom. water rises.Relying on his unique vision, the spirit of daring to fight and try new things, he quickly climbed from a small employee to the position of factory manager, and he was quite valued.Once, he went to Taohua Village to visit his relatives. He went early, and when he entered the village, he found that many people were rushing in one direction.Curiosity is human nature, not to mention that He Jingwen, who likes new things, abandoned his original intention of coming to Peach Blossom Village without saying a word, and then followed the fellow villagers in the same direction.Soon, he found that everyone had gathered at the door of one person\u2019s house in the end, and they were not crowded in such a mess, but lined up in an orderly manner, as if they were waiting for something.Judging from this posture, it didn\u2019t look like he was collecting debts or looking for trouble at the door. He Jingwen immediately sniffed out the unusual situation.\u201cBrother, what are you all doing?\u201d He Jingwen couldn\u2019t hold back, and asked a villager who was queuing up next to him.\u201cYou\u2019re new here, right? It\u2019s normal if you don\u2019t know. Everyone is queuing up to buy breakfast.\u201d The villager from Taohua Village said enthusiastically, with an inexplicable pride on his face.\u201cEarly?\u201d It was the first time He Jingwen heard this word, so he continued to ask with the good spirit of not being ashamed to ask, and then he gradually understood what early is, and at the same time, it also fully aroused his interest in this early. interest of.Everyone has been rigidly determined to eat nutritional powder and nutritional supplements. After all, generations of people have come here like this. No one thinks there is anything wrong with it, and no one will think about changing it.Even some people who study archaeology know that their ancestors ate other foods, but they just express their envy and don\u2019t think about changing it. After all, this is not something that can be changed if you want to change.However, he didn\u2019t expect that he would encounter such a thing when he was just going back to the countryside to visit relatives, which made him look forward to the upcoming breakfast stall.During the waiting process, none of the villagers were impatient. Instead, they talked to the people around them on their own, regardless of whether they knew each other. Driven by the same purpose, they quickly became friends. .During this process, He Jingwen also learned a lot of news about the Mu family\u2019s early stall, and his flexible head began to turn quickly again.Many people just come here to buy breakfast habitually. When they knew it was early, they were just very surprised, and secretly rejoiced that they would be able to eat an extremely delicious breakfast in the future. However, He Jingwen was different. , There is already a faint plan in his mind that is about to take shape, but whether to implement it in the end depends on whether the Mu family is worth the investment earlier.When the Mu family served it early, even though he hadn\u2019t eaten it yet, He Jingwen had already made a decision in his heart.When I got the buns, I looked at the white and tender buns, which were different from the nutrition powder. I took a bite, the juice was thick and delicious, so delicious that I almost wanted to bite off my tongue.If he had a plan in mind when he served it earlier, he can\u2019t wait to discuss it with the boss of the Mu family, and then expand this kind of breakfast to the county. Countless people are flocking to it, and the benefits it brings are huge and exciting.And this is only in the county seat. If it is extended to the city and the world, the number of benefits is absolutely unimaginable.Thinking of the bright future, He Jingwen couldn\u2019t help but want to go up to chat. Unfortunately, there are still a lot of customers, and everyone is surrounded by the little boss. He can only suppress his excitement and wait silently for everyone to finish their purchases. Only then did he dare to step forward.\u201cLittle boss, the breakfast at your house is really delicious. It\u2019s the first time I have eaten such a delicious thing. It\u2019s really great. If this kind of breakfast can be expanded, I believe there will be more People like it.\u201d He Jingwen came up with a heartfelt praise, and the words of praise did not cost money, and the wooden words he said were a little bit embarrassing.\u201cThank you.\u201d Mu Yan thanked him with a smile.\u201cReally, little boss, have you ever thought about going to the county town to open a store? There are more people in the county town, and the business will definitely be better then.\u201d He Jingwen said excitedly, and just wanted to tell the boss of the Mu family about the earlier business in detail. The prospect, but it turned out that the boss of the Mu family hadn\u2019t expressed his opinion, but the villagers of Taohua Village had reacted first.\u201cYou dare to come to our Taohua Village to pry the corner of the wall. Do you want to live? Get out of Taohua Village. You are not welcome in Taohua Village!\u201d react.Damn, the prying person has come to their Peach Blossom Village, I really don\u2019t want to live anymore, the little boss is the treasure of their Peach Blossom Village, if he is really kidnapped, where will they go to eat such delicious food early in the future.The others also gradually came to their senses, confronting He Jingwen with the same attitude, defending their little boss to the death, and must not let him be pried away, even if it is for their own appetite, they must defend to the death!He Jingwen did not expect the reaction of the people in Taohua Village to be so strong. The most important thing is that the villagers in Taohua Village are very united, and he is alone. Even if he wants to resist, he will not be able to resist the strength of all the villagers in Taohua Village In the end, he had no choice but to leave Taohua Village in despair, and even failed to visit his relatives.However, He Jingwen, who returned to the county seat, was obviously unwilling to give up just like this. He finally found a brand new profession. Knowing how much sensation it would cause and how much profit it would bring if it was spread out earlier, such a big piece of cake would be let go. In front of myself, there is no reason to give up and not eat.Afterwards, He Jingwen went to Taohua Village many times. At first, he could still enter Taohua Village, although he would soon be caught by villagers wandering around Mu\u2019s house and sent out of the village.Later, he couldn\u2019t even enter the gate of the village.Because He Jingwen went too many times, everyone became wary of him, and regarded him as the number one enemy of Taohua Village, almost reaching the point of being a household name. \u201cPlease go out.There is probably no one who can do this.If it were another person, it might be regrettable to give up, but whoever He Jingwen is, he is more stubborn than a cow, otherwise he would not have become the director of the factory at a young age.After many failures, He Jingwen\u2019s fighting spirit was fully stimulated, and the more frustrated he became, the more he tried to get into Taohua Village. He even put himself in a wooden cabinet and got into the village. In the team that entered the village, he had done this kind of thing more than once.Also because of He Jingwen\u2019s existence, the villagers of Taohua Village now have an additional investigative skill. Anyone who has malicious intentions enters the village, everyone can be vigilant at any time, so the probability of Taohua Village villagers being deceived has dropped a lot.Of course, these are things for later.On this day, He Jingwen armed himself again and planned to sneak into Taohua Village. He was confident that even if he stood in front of his parents now, his parents might not recognize him.After being armed, He Jingwen entered Peach Blossom Village like this, because based on his past experience, even if he is armed, as long as he enters the village with a little care and caution, he can be spotted by the sharp-eyed villagers. Knowing how these villagers did it, don\u2019t they all say that the villagers who are going down are simple and simple? Why did he meet all the villagers who were comparable to scouts? It was really depressing.Of course, He Jingwen would not know that the reason why these villagers have such heaven-defying skills is all thanks to him.At this moment, He Jingwen had sneaked into Peach Blossom Village openly and aboveboard. He didn\u2019t go to Mu\u2019s house in a hurry, but walked around the village first, and then came to the edge of the forest near Mu\u2019s house, and found the enclosed piece of land.Looking at the lush green plants emerging from the ground, He Jingwen wished he could learn what these plants were and what they were useful for from the boss of the Mu family. He was really curious about this.However, he didn\u2019t look at it for too long, and then he started to walk towards Mu\u2019s house pretending to be nonchalant.\u201cDong dong dong\u2026\u201d There was a knock on the door, and Mu Yan, who was basking in the sun in the yard, got up to open the door.Then when the door opened, Mu Yan was stunned by the costumes of the people outside, and it took him a long time to react.\u201cHello? May I ask who are you looking for?\u201d Mu Yan tried his best to control his eyes not to look at them, but his small eyes still secretly glanced up, thinking that they were very hidden, but in fact they were all seen by others.He Jingwen touched his nose in embarrassment, coughed lightly, and said, \u201cHello, my name is He Jingwen, and I want to talk to you about something, is that okay?\u201dAs soon as He Jingwen opened his mouth, Mu Yan\u2019s expression instantly changed to this 5: (\u00b0\u25b3.\u4e28|1)1 The small mouth opened into a circle, and there was a look of astonishment on his face.\u201cOkay\u2026ok.\u201d After a long time, Mu Yan came back to his senses, and then invited people inside.Although he came from a world without women, but because he has lived in this world for more than a year, he is more used to the existence of women, but\u2026 just dressed so strangely, and the voice is still a male \u201cwoman\u201d It\u2019s really the first time I\u2019ve seen it.He Jingwen saw Mu Yan\u2019s reaction and eyes, with a helpless expression on his face.If he could, he really didn\u2019t want to pretend to be like this, but the villagers of Taohua Village were too tough, he wouldn\u2019t be able to get in if he didn\u2019t.\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Mu Yan looked at He Jingwen, hesitating to speak, in fact, he really wanted to ask whether the other party was a man or a woman, but felt that it was impolite to ask, so he had to forcefully suppress the doubt in his heart. He planned to ask Ah Chen in private later, as Ah Chen is so smart, he must know.\u201cLittle boss, if you have any questions, just ask, I will know everything I know, and I will tell you everything.\u201d He Jingwen said to Mu Yan with a smile, because he was going to discuss business with them next, so he naturally wanted to stay in the other party\u2019s heart. Makes a good impression, and it\u2019s easier to talk that way.\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing, I\u2019ll go find Ah Chen.\u201d Mu Yan blushed for a moment, then hurriedly got up, and called Ah Chen who was still in the kitchen.When Mu Chen came out and saw the people sitting in the yard, his eyes darkened a lot, then he sat calmly in front of He Jingwen, and said to Mu Yan: \u201cMu Mu, I\u2019ve already made your favorite food, you go first Go to the kitchen and have some food\u2026and bring me two glasses of water.\u201dWhen He Jingwen heard this, the corners of his mouth couldn\u2019t help twitching, Mu Chen\u2019s pause was obvious just now, it\u2019s fine if he doesn\u2019t invite guests to eat together, but he didn\u2019t even plan to give him a glass of water?He Jingwen could clearly feel that Mu Chen was very unwelcome to him, which made him unable to help but beat a drum in his heart.\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Yan has always been very obedient, and went into the kitchen after Mu Chen finished speaking.\u201cI don\u2019t know what is your purpose of coming here dressed like this?\u201d Mu Chen asked very straightforwardly, without any hint of tact.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 - Ash is the bestPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAlthough He Jingwen felt that his skin was already very thick, he still couldn\u2019t help but feel very embarrassed when faced with such a straightforward question from Mu Chen.\u201cBoss Mu, don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t mean anything malicious.\u201d He Jingwen hurriedly explained, and then continued: \u201cActually, since the first time I ate the breakfast you made, I was very shocked and fell in love with it I wish I could eat this kind of breakfast every day. Unfortunately, my family is in Heyuan County, so I can\u2019t come to Taohua Village every day. I can\u2019t be as happy as the villagers in Taohua Village. I can eat these delicious breakfasts every day.Mu Chen sat there expressionless, listening to He Jingwen\u2019s long words of praise and his regret for not having breakfast, the veins on his forehead jumped suddenly, it seemed that he had almost reached the limit of his patience.At this moment, Mu Yan came out of the kitchen with two glasses of water, the coldness on Mu Chen\u2019s face instantly melted, he hurriedly got up and took the cup from the other party\u2019s hand, and then carefully helped Mu Yan put a soft cushion.He Jingwen stared dumbfounded at Mu Chen\u2019s gentleness towards Mu Yan. Compared with his experience of being almost frozen into ice just now, he suddenly felt a feeling of \u201ccomparing people with others, making people angry\u201d. It turns out that Boss Mu can do the same tenderness.He Jingwen didn\u2019t know at the moment that Mu Yan\u2019s appearance could be regarded as \u201csaving\u201d his life, otherwise, judging from the trend just now, He Jingwen might be thrown out by Mu Chen mercilessly in the next moment, and then Be classified as \u201crejected households\u201d.\u201cWhat purpose do you have to say directly.\u201d Mu Chen finally said impatiently.The words of praise He Jingwen wanted to utter were choked in his throat, and he coughed a few times before he got over it.\u201cAre you okay, why don\u2019t you drink some water.\u201d Mu Yan said with concern\u201cThank you, little boss.\u201d He Jingwen replied with a smile, and then he didn\u2019t dare to drag his feet, and said directly: \u201cThe craftsmanship of the two bosses is really very good. Have you ever thought about developing in the county? Of course, I don\u2019t want to The two abandoned Peach Blossom Village because they thought that with their skills, they would have more room for development in the county, where there would be more people and greater purchasing power. More people know about these earlier existences.\u201dWhat He Jingwen said earlier was not very attractive to Mu Chen and Mu Yan. After all, neither of them is the kind of greedy person. As long as they earn enough for their daily needs, they are very satisfied and do not desire anything. Wealth and wealth, especially for Mu Yan, as long as the family is harmonious, the children grow up healthy and healthy, and the family lives comfortably, it is already the best and the best life.However, the last sentence touched him and No. 5. After all, the ultimate goal of the food system is to spread food, so naturally they need to expand their business and let more people know the existence of these food.However, as for how to expand the business and how to let more people know about the existence of delicious food, Mu Yan has no idea at all, and No. 5 also said that at present, it is enough to focus on the upgrade task, and wait until it reaches a certain level After that, I was thinking about the main task.But if they have the conditions and opportunity to do the main task, they naturally don\u2019t want to miss it.\u201cYanyan, hurry up and ask him how to do it. If we can really let more people know about the existence of delicious food, then our main task can continue.\u201d No. 5 said excitedly. He is already very happy if he has achieved one percent. If he can still progress by one percent this time, he will be more confident to complete it.Mu Yan didn\u2019t respond to No. 5\u2019s words, but looked at Mu Chen with expectant little eyes, the meaning inside was self-evident.Mu Chen pampered Mu Yan\u2019s little head, and he swallowed the \u201crefusal\u201d words that he was going to spit out in an instant, and changed what he was about to say without any sense of disobedience, without feeling that he was unprincipled at all.For Mu Chen, Mu Yan is his principle!\u201cContinue.\u201d Mu Chen said very coldly, his posture was like a domineering president listening to his subordinates\u2019 reports.The most important thing is that He Jingwen didn\u2019t feel that there was anything wrong with this. When facing Mu Chen, he always felt inferior, and would unconsciously treat him as his superior, even though he was actually just a villager in Taohua Village .In the past, even if he was really the boss of his company, he never faced such pressure as he faced Mu Chen.There is no way, who made Mu Chen\u2019s aura too strong, if he didn\u2019t know that the other party was a villager from Taohua Village, he really thought that the other party was a rich man from some developed planet who came to vacation.However, after getting the consent of the other party, He Jingwen became more confident in the next conversation, and said all his thoughts and plans without reservation, and even some of them were thought of during the conversation. The purpose of speaking out in an orderly manner is to increase the bargaining chip to persuade the other party and win this cooperation.\u201cThere are only two of us.\u201d Mu Chen said coldly.How could He Jingwen fail to hear the hidden meaning of the other party\u2019s words, and said: \u201cI heard that you are already training apprentices, and it is also possible to let your apprentices sit in the town at that time, and now only your family can make delicious food , even if the taste of your apprentices is far inferior to yours, there will be countless people who will buy it, after all, this is a new thing, and many people have never tried it.\u201d\u201cAt that time, I will be responsible for all the trivial matters such as store selection, decoration, and publicity. You only need to be in charge of the back kitchen. In this way, you can save a lot of energy and concentrate on these delicacies. What do you think? ?\u201d Although He Jingwen asked Mu Chen, his eyes fell on Mu Yan.After this short period of observation, he finally understood that although Mu Chen was in charge of the negotiation, Mu Yan was the real caller. In other words, Mu Chen attached great importance to Mu Yan\u2019s ideas. If so, then it must be based on Mu Yan\u2019s thoughts.He Jingwen couldn\u2019t help but sigh with emotion, Mu Chen with such a strong aura is actually a seed of infatuation, the little boss is really happy to spoil his wife so much.\u201cIn this way, will many people really be able to learn about food? If I want to teach them how to make these themselves, can I do it?\u201d Mu Yan asked.Their purpose is not only to spread, but also to let them feel the charm of delicious food. It is only for them to spread and make, and they must not be concerned about the entire planet, let alone other planets, so the best way is naturally to let these people I also learn to cook by myself, so that everyone can spontaneously help spread the food.However, Mu Yan didn\u2019t know how shocked He Jingwen heard what he said.\u201cLittle Boss\u2026 Do you want to pass on your cooking skills to others?\u201d He Jingwen couldn\u2019t believe what he heard. Whose family has a family heirloom skill that is not hidden, even if it is an apprentice, it will not bring it to 100% Hundred,After all, examples of \u201cteaching apprentices and starving masters\u201d abound, not to mention the completely blank food market.However, what did he hear today? I heard that the little boss wants to teach these culinary skills to ordinary people. If the news spreads, it will definitely cause a big sensation. By then, it will not only be a sensation on their small planet, but maybe the entire Federation It will all be a sensation.\u201cIf everyone knows how to cook for themselves, then these delicacies can be spread more widely, let more people know, and then more people can cook and eat by themselves, wouldn\u2019t it be great?\u201d Mu Yan replied with a smile, if When that time really comes, even if he doesn\u2019t have to take the initiative to spread the word, everyone will probably rush to spread the word and learn, then the task will definitely be completed faster.Therefore, for Mu Yan and No. 5, the task is the most important thing, and for Mu Chen, he doesn\u2019t care about these interests.He Jingwen looked at Mu Yan who was so calm and calm, and couldn\u2019t help but admire him even more. If before, he just wanted to cooperate with the other party and benefit from it, then now, he feels that he has found a bigger and farther goal Yes, my heart was filled with pride.Just imagine, if people in the entire Federation can cook for themselves and eat such delicacies in the future, then what they have done is a food revolution, which will wake everyone up from the nightmare of nutritional powder and nutritional supplements. What a great thing to taste the taste and charm of food.Just thinking about it this way made He Jingwen feel passionate.\u201cLittle boss, you are really great and powerful.\u201d He Jingwen sighed in admiration.Mu Yan blushed slightly when he was told, and replied in a low voice: \u201cAh Chen is the most powerful.\u201dThe corners of Mu Chen\u2019s mouth slightly raised, evoking a faint smile that reached directly to his eyes.\u201cIf the little boss wants to teach others how to cook, then he should go to the county to develop. But for now, I suggest that the little boss should not teach others how to cook. After all, the food is just starting now, and there are not many People know this, and after more people feel the charm of food and like it, I believe that more people will be willing to come and learn after carrying out food teaching activities.\u201d According to the current situation, He Jingwen proposed to Mu Yan suggestion.If it was said that when he first came here, he had the purpose of convincing Mu Yan and Mu Chen to cooperate with him, then now he is really thinking of Mu Yan sincerely.He was moved by Mu Yan\u2019s selflessness, and the grand plan that Mu Yan described made him full of motivation and enthusiasm. Now, he just wants to join Mu Yan\u2019s team and strive for the goal of making food for all people Do your part.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know how to do many things now, but I will work hard to learn more.\u201d When the time comes, I will be able to teach everyone more ways to eat, Mu Yan said excitedly.Mu Chen was sitting next to Mu Yan, hugged him into his arms, and let him express what he thought in his heart, but he just pampered him.He Jingwen also found out that he was talking with Mu Chen at the beginning, and gradually turned into talking with Mu Yan. However, he didn\u2019t show any discomfort for such a change. Instead, he felt that the content of the exchange made him feel uncomfortable. It\u2019s getting hotter and hotter.This exchange lasted all afternoon. Both Mu Yan and He Jingwen felt unsatisfied with this conversation, especially He Jingwen, who had already forgotten the original purpose, and the rest was just wanting to go deeper with Mu Yan. , in an in-depth discussion of food.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 - perseverePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFrom that day on, He Jingwen would come to Peach Blossom Village whenever he had time, and the ways of getting in were all kinds of strange.Mu Yan has also gotten used to it from being surprised at the beginning, whenever he sees strange people, He Jingwen must be the first thing that comes to mind.Following the communication with Mu Yan and Mu Chen, a certain decision in He Jingwen\u2019s heart became more and more determined.Mu Yan and He Jingwen also feel very happy in the communication, and are also very interested in the blueprint of the other party\u2019s plan, and yearn for it.After getting along several times, Mu Chen also got to know He Jingwen. After all, he was choosing a partner, so he had to know the basics of the partner, otherwise it would be easy to cause problems.After He Jingwen entered Taohua Village again at the risk of \u201clife\u201d and communicated with Mu Chenmuyan, the two parties formally established a partnership.He Jingwen was very excited and felt that he had finally made it through and could finally do a good job.Even for the sake of the cooperation between the two parties, He Jingwen directly quit his promising and high-paying job in the eyes of outsiders. Under the pressure of his family\u2019s ignorance and disapproval, he devoted himself to the cooperation with Mu Chen and the others.Mu Chen and Muyan are not idle either, they used to just guard this small shop and make breakfast for the villagers, now that they have cooperated with others and plan to be busy on a large scale, naturally they can\u2019t be complacent.The five waiters in the store have all gone to the back kitchen to help. Li Hao, Liu Hu, and Zhao Hanyuan started from the most basic dish washing. At the beginning, Zhang Mingfei and Tao Qingran were even able to skillfully chop and serve vegetables. After a while, they will be able to watch Mu Chen stir-fry on the stove.Zhang Mingfei and Tao Qingran were very excited about this.Even though they are not yet deeply involved in the world, they also know how much influence cooking skills have on the world. After all, there has never been such a kind of food before. They rob customers, even if the bosses miss some customers for them, their income will definitely be more than that of working hard.Of course, smart people will not go out and do it alone after learning it. After all, following the bosses, eating meat and drinking soup is the most.Now Zhang Mingfei and others simply worship Mu Chen Muyan as a god, and they work even harder. After all, as the first batch of beneficiaries, they don\u2019t get too many envious eyes, so theyI\u2019m also very worried, if I don\u2019t work hard and get replaced by someone else, I won\u2019t be able to cry at that time.\u201cZhang Mingfei, bring some water here.\u201d Mu Chen said to Zhang Mingfei while making peace with no expression on his face.In the past, under the advice of Lin Jiayu and Yang Wenyao, they would reconcile noodles at home and sell them after wrapping them up. But now that they have decided to train these five people well, naturally they will not shy away from doing this. .\u201cBoss, the water is here.\u201d Zhang Mingfei put the water beside him, and his eyes could not help but drift to the face that Mu Chen was holding.He is most familiar with the white powdery thing, after all, before the snack bar opened, that thing was their daily needs.But when everyone was eating, at most they would make the nutritional powder into a paste and drink it, but they didn\u2019t expect that such an ordinary nutritional powder could still do this.Zhang Mingfei\u2019s eyes widened, and he watched in amazement that the nutrition powder slowly condensed into a ball under Mu Chen\u2019s hands, it was white, and people couldn\u2019t help but want to touch it, and it was a little familiar.Mu Chen didn\u2019t want to avoid Zhang Mingfei either. He put the reconciled dough on the chopping board, divided it into pieces of the same size, rolled them into dough, and wrapped the fillings that had already been prepared. With a few simple strokes, a white dough The fat and cute buns are formed.Zhang Mingfei watched from the beginning to the end, and the more he watched, the more surprised he became.\u201cBoss, are the steamed buns we usually eat made of nutritional powder?\u201d Zhang Mingfei asked in disbelief.\u201cEn.\u201d Mu Chen answered one word very succinctly, without stopping the movements of his hands.I\u2019m afraid Zhang Mingfei is the only one who knows how surprised Zhang Mingfei is at the moment. He never thought that the skin of such delicious and delicious buns is actually made of the most common nutritional powder. This is simply\u2026 It\u2019s incredible .What kind of brains are the big boss and the little boss, who can come up with such a strange way of eating, obviously everyone has the same head, why are some people\u2019s heads so smart?\u201cThen\u2026 the scallion pancakes, radish rolls, and pies, too?\u201d Zhang Mingfei suddenly remembered the staple foods he usually eats, they all seemed a bit similar. Now that I think about it, aren\u2019t they all made with nutritional powder, although the methods are different? .\u201cOk.\u201dZhang Mingfei felt that a door was quietly opened in front of him, and the world inside was colorful.\u201cBig boss, don\u2019t worry, I will never say anything.\u201d Zhang Mingfei said vowedly, he knew that the big boss didn\u2019t want to avoid him on purpose, otherwise he would never know.This is the trust that the big boss has placed in him. Naturally, he can\u2019t live up to the trust of the boss. Even if he finds out that what they eat is made of the most common nutritional powder, he will never say anything about it.Moreover, even if you know that it is made of nutritional powder, so what, if you don\u2019t have a big boss, you will never think that you can eat it like this. The most important thing is, even if you know, you can\u2019t make it yourself. Still the best.Mu Chen didn\u2019t deny Zhang Mingfei\u2019s oath, and he didn\u2019t care. Since Mu Mu wanted to pass on his culinary skills, everyone would know about it sooner or later, so it didn\u2019t matter if it was sooner or later.Ever since He Jingwen and Mu Chenmuyan had reached an agreement, they started looking for a suitable shop in the county.At the beginning, he said that Mu Chen Muyan only needed to be in charge of the back kitchen, and all other trivial matters were handed over to him. As expected, Mu Chen Muyan really didn\u2019t bother, at most, when he found a few suitable shop addresses, he would let him Mu Chen and Mu Yan choose the location and decoration style they like, and then he will contact everything else.Although it was difficult at the beginning, the funds were not much, and he didn\u2019t have any salary. When others thought he was crazy, he enjoyed it because he knew how much it would be once the store opened. It is so popular, not to mention the start-up capital, even if it is doubled, it will be earned back in minutes.He Jingwen was busy looking for a shop, while Mu Chen was busy teaching his apprentices, Mu Yan was not idle either.Mu Yan took out all the recipes rewarded by these system upgrades, sorted them out, and there were only eight of them, and they were basically common snacks. , obviously not enough.In addition, Mu Yan had always lived in the countryside in his previous life, and he didn\u2019t know much about it. Even if he had enough ingredients, he couldn\u2019t make too many tricks, so the most urgent thing now is to learn more about how to make food.\u201cNo. 5, are there any other recipes in the system? Can they only be obtained through upgrading?\u201d Mu Yan asked while sorting out the previous rewards.\u201cIf you are lucky in the lottery, you can get it.\u201d No. 5 replied, but the uncertainty of the lottery is too great, and the number of lottery draws is not many.\u201cIs this the only way?\u201d Mu Yan was a little depressed. If he only relied on this, when would he be able to learn more and teach others, otherwise it would be just a few things, and he would be embarrassed to teach it.Number five floated in mid-air, opened his mouth several times but closed it again, not to mention the tangled appearance of hesitating to speak.In the end, Number Five seemed to have made up his mind and said, \u201cActually, there is another way to get the recipe.\u201d\u201cWhat way?\u201d Mu Yan asked with bright eyes.\u201cThere are recipes for sale in the system store, but our current level is not enough to open the store.\u201d Number Five said.\u201cWhen will it be opened?\u201d Mu Yan asked hastily.\u201cWe have to wait until the system reaches level ten.\u201dMu Yan looked at his current level, and then calculated the time it would take to get to the current level, and suddenly felt a little depressed.It took only one year to advance to level five. If you want to advance to level ten, wouldn\u2019t it take another year, and this is because the previous levels are easier, maybe it will take more time then.\u201cThen where did we redeem the things we exchanged with points?\u201d Mu Yan suddenly thought of the non-existent things that we exchanged with points before. If those can be exchanged, can the recipes also be used?\u201cThe ones that are redeemed are all in the system space, which is different from the ones in the store. Although the store will also need points to be redeemed after the store opens, this point is different from the previous points.\u201d No. 5 explained, but It was a bit of a mouthful, and even I was about to get involved, \u201cIn short, when the time comes, you will know.\u201d\u201cHowever, it\u2019s not impossible to get the things in the store now, but the price to pay is a bit high.\u201d Fifth hesitated for a while and said again.\u201cHow to do it?\u201d Mu Yan asked hastily, as long as he can do it, he will definitely try to do it.Now both He Jingwen and Ah Chen are working hard for the future, but he is the only one who is free every day. Apart from looking at the little balls, there is nothing to do. Even the work in the snack bar, Ah Chen Don\u2019t let him do it.So, he wanted to do something for everyone.\u201cThere are only three chances to get items in the store before the store has been opened, and after each acquisition, ten times the corresponding points will be deducted, and there will be additional penalties based on the items obtained, for example, if you want a recipe, Then in addition to points, you also need to learn the first ten dishes on the recipe within a month, and you have to make ten copies of each to the system. If you can\u2019t complete it, all the previous upgrades of the system will be cleared Zero.\u201d No. 5 introduced as much detail as possibleThis price does not seem too serious, but in this world where there are no ingredients, it is not so easy to make the top ten dishes, at least the ingredients alone may not be able to pass. When the time comes, the front All your efforts will be in vain, and you will have to start from scratch.Therefore, No. 5 didn\u2019t intend to reveal this method to Mu Yan at first, but seeing Mu Yan\u2019s depressed mood, it couldn\u2019t bear it.\u201cYanyan, you must think clearly, if we can\u2019t find all the ingredients for these ten dishes, then we will definitely not be able to complete them, and then all our previous efforts will be in vain.\u201d No. 5 told the worst result Mu Yan, let him know about this matter, and then he can make a choice.When Mu Yan heard this, he was a little hesitant, but he really wanted to do something for everyone, and when the shops in the county opened, they would definitely need a lot of dishes.\u201cWhen Ah Chen comes back, let me discuss it with Ah Chen.\u201d Mu Yan saidroad.Such an important matter still needs to be discussed with Ah Chen. At that time, Ah Chen can do whatever he wants, and he will listen to Ah Chen.No. 5 couldn\u2019t help but rolled his eyes, hating Mu Yan\u2019s \u201cregarding his husband as the sky\u201d, but unfortunately, no matter how many times he said it, the other party was still unmoved, so he simply didn\u2019t say anything. up.Fortunately, Mu Chen also looks like a wife and slave, otherwise he would definitely try his best to persuade the little host to leave the wolf den.\u201cAchen, Achen, I want to discuss something with you.\u201d Seeing Mu Chen\u2019s return, Mu Yan said impatiently.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Mu Chen looked at Mu Yan with a smile, all the exhaustion on his body dissipated the moment he returned home, leaving only a deep sense of warmth.\u201cAchen, there is a recipe on the 5th, but you need points to redeem it, and you need to complete the first ten dishes of the recipe to get it. If you can\u2019t complete it, you will be punished. Do you think we want to redeem that recipe?\u201d Mu Yan told Mu Chen everything he could think of.Mu Chen touched Mu Yan\u2019s small head, motioned him not to worry, and then looked at number five.Being watched by Mu Chen, No. 5 always had a very restrained feeling, which prevented him from being as comfortable as he was in front of Mu Yan, and hurriedly added: \u201cThis cookbook is in the system store, but the store must be at level ten. It can only be opened in the future, if you go to forcibly exchange the items in the store now, you will naturally have to pay a price, and the price of this cookbook is that if you can\u2019t complete the task, all the levels will be cleared and restarted.\u201d\u201cIs there a time limit for making the ten dishes?\u201d Mu Chen calmly asked.asked.\u201cYes, it will be completed within a month.\u201d Number Five replied.Mu Chen thought for a while in silence, Mu Yan has been snuggling by his side, his face is full of dependence and trust.This is his man, only his man.In their world, the big family affairs are generally decided by the man, and my brother will not think that the man is disrespecting him. After all, the man has more knowledge and experience than the brother, and the thinking of the times The limitation is there, it\u2019s only natural for my brother to obey the man\u2019s arrangement.Therefore, Mu Yan more or less has some feudal thoughts of that era, but Mu Chen is not that kind of machismo. Normally, the two will discuss it, and Mu Chen puts Mu Yan\u2019s wishes first. is more common.\u201cSo, the biggest difficulty this month is the uncertainty of the ingredients.\u201d Mu Chen pointed out the biggest difficulty of this task.\u201cYes, if you can\u2019t find all the ingredients within a month, you won\u2019t be able to complete it.\u201d Number Five replied.\u201cWhat does Yan Yan want the recipe for?\u201d Mu Chen ignored No. 5, but lowered his head and asked Mu Yan.If this cookbook is really important to Mu Mu, he will definitely exchange it directly without further ado. As for the additional tasks, it is best to complete them, even if they cannot be completed, it does not matter, but the system level is just cleared, and it will be upgraded at that time That\u2019s it.If No. 5 could read Mu Chen\u2019s heart at this moment, he would be very shocked, and would even silently give Mu Chen a thumbs up, and then he would be speechless.\u201cAren\u2019t we going to open a store in the county town? There will definitely be more customers by then, so I want to learn how to order more dishes, and then help you share the work. You are the only one busy. It\u2019s really tiring.\u201d Mu Yan said distressedly .Looking at Mu Chen\u2019s so handsome face that one can\u2019t help but fall into obsession, but at the moment it looks a lot thinner, his heart tightens up and down, wishing to bring all the delicious food to him.\u201cI\u2019m not tired, don\u2019t forget, my body is very strong, this kind of work will not be tiring, but after the store expands, I really need some new recipes, in this case, let\u2019s exchange them.\u201d Mu Chen made up his mind. I made up my mind.\u201cReally? What if we can\u2019t finish it?\u201d Mu Yan was still a little entangled and worried.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m here.\u201d Mu Chen\u2019s deep and magnetic voice sounded softly, just like the sound of a wonderful cello. It makes people blush and heartbeat, and their hearts are as sweet as eating honey.Mu Yan couldn\u2019t stand Mu Chen\u2019s serious love talk the most, it made him blush every time, wishing he could bury his head in the other\u2019s chest and not come out to see anyone.\u201cEn.\u201d Mu Yan\u2019s muffled voice came from Mu Chen\u2019s chest.Mu Chen indulged him to continue lying on his stomach, then looked up at No. 5 and asked him to exchange the recipe.The soft, fluffy number five, at the moment, is wearing a pair of strange sunglasses on that round face, covering all the small eyes that are not big at all, obviously flashed by the loving couple in front of her. When I arrived, I could only wear sunglasses for the sake of my eyes.No. 5 quickly redeemed the recipe from the store, threw it to Mu Chen, and flew out immediately.If it stayed any longer, it was very worried whether it would be blinded even with sunglasses on.Really, if you show your affection in front of children like this, are you really not afraid of spoiling it?The system student is really lonely like snow, when will it find a system sister, and then it must blind the pair\u2019s eyes, hum!It is said to be a cookbook, but it is really a cookbook. Except for the cover, it looks like any other book.Open the cookbook, the first page is the recipe of a dish, andIt is not the same as the recipe for system upgrade rewards.The recipes rewarded by the system upgrade are basically some home-cooked dishes or breakfast staples, but the dishes on the recipes look more delicate and complicated.Mu Chen, who was exposed to such a variety of recipes for the first time, blankly flipped through the pages. Each page has a detailed introduction of a dish, from ingredients, methods to finished product appearance, taste and so on.Mu Chen felt that a door in front of him was slowly opened. He thought the delicacies before were very good, but he didn\u2019t expect that there were even better ones.\u201cAh Chen, are the first ten dishes above hard to cook?\u201d Mu Yan asked, he was still worried about the task.Of course, after being comforted by Mu Chen, he trusts his lover to be able to complete this task, so his worry now has changed from whether he can complete the task to the difficulty of the task.If the task was simple, then Ah Chen would be able to relax a bit. After all, this was the result of his willfulness, but Ah Chen had to undertake it.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s not difficult.\u201d Mu Chen closed the recipe and said soothingly\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Mu Yan breathed a sigh of relief, and then clicked on the system panel to check the points.\u201cAchen, look, the points haven\u2019t decreased.\u201d Mu Yan looked at the column of system points. In the past, whenever something was exchanged, the branches would change, but this time there was no change.Mu Chen looked in the direction Mu Yan pointed, and the points in that column did not change. He carefully observed every place on the system panel. Since No. 5 said to use points to redeem, there must be something happening. changed.Sure enough, soon, Mu Chen saw that the points on another points column had changed, and turned into a nightmarish negative number.Mu Chen and Mu Yan didn\u2019t know how the points in this column appeared, because every time the task was upgraded and the food needed for the task was made, the added points were above the previous points.\u201cThe points here are less, but don\u2019t worry, we will earn them back in the future. All these negative points will become positive, and they will become bigger and bigger.\u201d Mu Chen said with a smile.\u201cEn.\u201d Mu Yan nodded vigorously, agreeing.So, in the next month, the customers of Taohua Village were pleasantly surprised to find that from time to time, there would be a fresh and uneaten dish in the snack bar, and these dishes tasted more delicious than the staple food such as steamed buns and scallion pancakes. It is even more delicious, especially if it is paired with staple food, the taste can make people wish they had five stomachs, no matter how much they eat, it\u2019s not enough, okay?\u201cHey\u2026the bosses are really good at playing. They cook delicious food in different ways. If this continues, I feel that my weight will gradually increase.\u201d A female customer rubbed her flat stomach and said Said with a worried face, but the look in his eyes did not match the words he said.\u201cThe bosses are really amazing. There are so many delicious foods. How did they make them? I really can\u2019t even eat a bite of nutrition powder. I look forward to the opening of the snack bar every day, and then come here Enjoy it.\u201d\u201cMe too, me too. Even when I\u2019m at work, I just think about what I\u2019m going to eat after get off work, and what delicious food will be in the snack bar tomorrow.\u201d\u201cThe people in our company are almost all loyal customers of the snack bar. In the past, when we got together, we would talk about cosmetics and clothes. Now there is only one topic, which is what is the best food in the snack bar. What else has been launched, I think if this continues, everyone will become a foodie.\u201dThe customers of the snack bar chatted with each other during their leisure time while waiting for the meal. Whether they knew each other or not, they all became friends at this moment, chatting happily without any sense of strangeness.The first ten dishes given in the recipe are indeed as Mu Chen said, they are fairly simple, of course, this is also relative to the following dishes.If it is compared with the previous one, it is naturally more complicated, at least each dish needs more than ten kinds of ingredients?However, some of them have already been found, some have not, so every day, apart from the normal business of the snack bar, Mu Chen and Mu Yan still spend most of their time looking for ingredients in the forest.However, because of the existence of Xiaolu and the identification technique, it has brought them a lot of convenience, and it is naturally more effective in finding ingredientsTherefore, Mu Chen was not so worried that these tasks would not be completed.Zhang Mingfei and others also work very hard every day. After that day, Mu Chen will let them observe while they are cooking. It is already what countless people want but can\u2019t get, so the five of them cherish it very much.The regular customers in the snack bar also knew that Mu Chen and Mu Yan had taken in five apprentices, that is, the five waiters back then. Suddenly, many of them were beating their chests, regretting that they didn\u2019t work harder during the interview, otherwise they might be taught by now. Among the people who cook, I can be one of them.\u201cLittle boss, when will you still recruit waiters?\u201d Someone asked during the meal, and everyone else listened carefully with their ears pricked up.If you are recruiting waiters this time, even if you quit your job, you must come to apply. If you are lucky enough to be taught cooking skills like the first batch of waiters, then their future will be brighter than any other job of.\u201cHmm\u2026 I\u2019m not too sure about this, it depends on Ah Chen\u2019s intentions.\u201d Mu Yan replied holding the curious little ball.\u201cThe little boss must inform me when he is recruiting waiters. I have a relative who really wants to come.\u201d The customer said enthusiastically.Other customers followed suit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even those in the slums have an optical brain, but the version is relatively low.Therefore, when hearing Mu Yan\u2019s inquiry, all the customers who heard it widened their eyes, and their expressions were like looking at aliens.\u201cLittle boss, don\u2019t you all use computers? Although our planet\u2019s computer technology is not as advanced as that of optical brains, computers are still pretty good and cheap.\u201d\u201cLittle boss, let\u2019s make a website for the snack bar, so that everyone can get news about the snack bar from the website at any time in the future, and you can put the news about your future employment and new food on it.\u201d\u201cNo matter how bad it is, let\u2019s create a Weibo, which is widely used, easy to operate, and very convenient for everyone to communicate with.\u201d Another customer suggested.Mu Yan silently wrote down all these incomprehensible nouns, planning to ask Ah Chen later.In Mu Yan\u2019s heart, Mu Chen is almost omnipotent.Sure enough, after the snack bar closed, Mu Yan relayed the words of those customers to Mu Chen.Mu Chen pondered for a while, and felt that what the customer said was quite reasonable, especially after the snack bar in Heyuan County opened, it would be more convenient to have a Weibo.Although Mu Chen didn\u2019t have much ambition to start a business before, after thinking about it for a period of time, he felt that as a husband and the pillar of the family, how could he not even have this motivation, and even Mu Mu\u2019s achievements were lower than Mu Chen\u2019s. No, this gave him a serious sense of crisis.Therefore, after He Jingwen cooperated with the Mu family, Mu Chen is obviously more motivated than before, because he is now a husband and a father, and if he wants to work hard to give his lover and children a better life, he must work harder. .\u201cMumu, let\u2019s go to the mall to buy a computer in the afternoon.\u201d Mu Chen said to Mu ChenSaid.\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Yan replied.In the afternoon, the two came to the largest computer city in Heyuan County, because there was no place to buy computers in the village, so the two could only come to the county by carThis is the first time for Mu Yan to come to the county seat, looking at the surrounding high-rise buildings and busy traffic, the whole person has a feeling of traveling again.He knew that the world was much more developed than theirs, but he didn\u2019t expect it to be so developed. When he was in the village, he didn\u2019t have such a strong sense of difference, but after he came to the city, the feeling was very obvious.There are also tall buildings in the village, but the highest is no more than ten floors, and there are not many, but there are almost all tall buildings in the city, and there is no trace of their world at all.The straight road was full of high-speed vehicles, and even some flying cars in the sky made Mu Yan dumbfounded, and subconsciously hugged Qiuqiu in his arms.\u201cQiaoqiu, you have to be good, you can\u2019t run around here, you know, if you get lost, daddy won\u2019t be able to find you.\u201d Mu Yan told the little tiger earnestly.\u201cAww\u2026\u201d The little tiger obediently yelled at Mu Yan twice, as if answering.The supernatural beings who can transform are very smart. Even if they are only a few months old, they are much smarter than ordinary children of the same age, and they can understand what adults say.\u201cLet\u2019s go, we will use these in the future.\u201d Mu Chen stroked Mu Yan\u2019s hair and said with a smile.When I come out this time, I not only need to buy two computers to go back, but also buy a car.I didn\u2019t think it was necessary before, and I didn\u2019t go to other places in the village, but after I have a shop in Heyuan County, the car is very necessary.Mu Yan was obediently led by Mu Chen to the largest electronic shopping mall in Heyuan CountyThe electronic shopping mall covers a very large area, and there is everything in it. Basically, you can buy everything you need here.When Mu Yan entered the electronic shopping mall, he was like Grandma Liu who entered the Grand View Garden. Everything he saw was very strange.\u201cGive me two M-type optical brains.\u201d Mu Chen walked to a counter and subconsciously said directly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, we don\u2019t have an M-type optical computer here, and the highest model is only an H-type computer.\u201d The shopping guide lady\u2019s eyes were shining, and she smiled sweetly, especially after seeing Mu Chen, her smile became even brighter up.The M-type optical brain is currently the highest model optical brain in the Federation. Not to mention that they don\u2019t have any on this backward planet, even the outer planets have very few. Probably only the families of the central star can afford it. Bar.Hearing this, Mu Chen frowned, saying that the M-type optical brain was just subconsciously said, and now he is asked to think about what the M-type optical brain looks like, and he himself can\u2019t explain it clearly.\u201cThen the H model.\u201d Mu Chen said.\u201cOkay, wait a moment.\u201d The shopping guide lady went to the backstage to get the computer with a sweet smile.Several other shopping guides around also looked over quietly, some were even secretly touching up their makeup, talking in a low voice, their cheeks were flushed, as if they had applied rouge.That person is so handsome, isn\u2019t he a celebrity?\u201cI don\u2019t know, but we really don\u2019t have such handsome guys here. I guess they come from some big city to play.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what the handsome guy\u2019s name is, but it would be great if I could get the communication number\u201cThe little handsome guy next to him is also pretty good, he looks so cute and cute.\u201d\u201cOkay, don\u2019t think about it, those two people know they are a couple at a glance.\u201d\u201cHow can this be? Why do good men go to find good men? How can we women live?\u201dMu Yan listened to the female shopping guides next door talking about Mu Chen, feeling weird, and subconsciously took a step forward, trying to block the sight of those people from looking at Mu Chen, but unexpectedly, this action even aroused the attention of Mu Chen. Attention those women.\u201cAww\u2026 Xiao Shou is jealous, haha, she is so cute, I really want to go up and pinch that soft face, it must feel very goodit is good. \u201c\u201cHey, don\u2019t be so nympho, okay, it will scare people, but Xiao Shou\u2019s jealous look is so cute.\u201d\u201cMumu, do you like this?\u201d Mu Chen asked in a low voice, holding a square thing like a small box in his hand\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Mu Yan held it in his hand, looked around, but couldn\u2019t see what it was.\u201cThis is the computer with the highest model on our planet. Although it is not as convenient as the optical computers on other planets, it is easier to carry than bulky desktops and notebooks.\u201d The shopping guide lady introduced professionally.Mu Chen turned on the palmtop computer, moved his fingers flexibly on it, and then saw a large screen of 60 cm long and 40 cm wide standing above the computer.\u201cWow, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d Mu Yan opened his big eyes and looked at the screen in amazement, looking at the constantly changing pictures on it. Although he didn\u2019t understand it, he watched it very seriously.Qiuqiu stayed in Muyan\u2019s arms, staring at the screen with her round eyes.One person and one beast have almost the same expression, which makes the people around them dizzy.\u201cOh, oh, oh\u2026 No, no, that little beast is so cute, I really want to raise one too.\u201d\u201cOh my god, this is too foul. They have exactly the same expression. Why does Mao make the same expression as a man and a beast?\u201dThe girls around couldn\u2019t help screaming, not only the shopping guide, but even some female customers were given to the cute masters by Mu Yan and Qiuqiu.Obviously, he should look like a country bumpkin who doesn\u2019t know anything, but in Muyan, it will only make people feel cute and cute.\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Mu Chen asked with a slight smile on his lips.\u201cYeah.\u201d Mu Yan nodded his head vigorously, but still didn\u2019t look back from the computer.Qiuqiu also imitated his father\u2019s way, and nodded vigorously, which immediately caused a burst of chatter.Mu Chen handed the handheld computer to Mu Yan, let him play freely, and then pay by himself.The three members of this family never paid attention to the surprise and clamor of the people around them from the beginning to the end, Mu Chen didn\u2019t care at all, Mu Yan didn\u2019t even think that those things were caused by himself, and as for the kid Qiuqiu, he couldn\u2019t think so much.So, after buying the computer, Mu Chen took Mu Yan to the car dealership.Most of the cars on this planet run on land, and the more advanced ones are flying cars that can take air routes, but the price of this type of car is not affordable by ordinary people.For now, a car running on the road is enough for Mu Yan Muchen\u2019s daily use, so speeding cars are not considered.But when he saw those flying cars, the image of flying cars all over the sky flashed through Mu Chen\u2019s mind, but he forgot it in just a moment.The right to choose the car is naturally still in Mu Yan\u2019s hands, and the shape and color that Mu Yan likes is what he ultimately buys.Neither of them is the kind of person who likes to go shopping, Mu Yan didn\u2019t have that condition before, and Mu Chen\u2019s personality dictated it.Therefore, it only took less than half a day to buy a computer and a car, and it was still early to go back, so Mu Chen decided to take Mu Yan to see He Jingwen, and care about the situation of his partners by the way.It can be said that He Jingwen is very busy these days, and he puts all his body and mind on the snack bar. If it is not because he is full of enthusiasm and motivation every day, he might have collapsed because of his busyness.When He Jingwen saw Mu Chen Muyan, it was like seeing a relative, and he happily brought him to the shop that had just been confirmed.At this moment, the shop has just been rented and has not yet started decoration, so it is very simple, but it has a large area. It can be seen that He Jingwen is really planning to do a big job.\u201cHow about it? This store is very nice. I\u2019ve already contacted the decoration team. In another month, the decoration here will be almost finished, and we can open another day.\u201d He Jingwen introduced, looking forward to the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Interstellar Cute Little HusbandChapter 96 - accidentPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cIt just so happens that you are here, so I won\u2019t have to look for you again. What kind of decoration style do you like? Let\u2019s make a decision together today, so that the decoration team can start work as soon as possible.\u201d He Jingwen suddenly took out a handheld computer, Then call out the decoration renderings of about ten Laifu stores, and let Mu Chen and Mu Yan choose.\u201cMu Mu, which one do you like?\u201d Mu Chen asked Mu Yan directly.He Jingwen was very used to Mu Chen\u2019s wife-loving attribute, and he didn\u2019t mind, so he directly put the renderings in front of Mu Yan.There are warm style, dreamy style, and Barot style, which cover almost all decoration styles. Every picture looks very beautiful and individual, and it is difficult to make a choice for a while.\u201cAh Chen, which one do you like?\u201d Mu Yan asked.\u201cWhat you like is what I like.\u201d Mu Chen said directly without thinking, and his love talk skills became brighter and brighter.Mu Yan\u2019s face was flushed, and he quickly put his eyes on the rendering in front of him, and lowered his head, lest he be seen by others.The longer you spend with them, the more He Jingwen feels how sad it is to be a single dog, because no one will accompany you to bear the critical blows of other people\u2019s love, and you can\u2019t fight back, you can only bear it passively.However, fortunately, after getting along so many times, his endurance has been greatly improved.In the end, the decoration style was decided by Mu Yan, who chose a warm style.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, after one month, I will definitely give you an exactly the same perfect snack bar.\u201d He Jingwen said with great emotion, as if he was doing something very, very great.\u201cBy the way, what do you plan to call the snack bar?\u201d He Jingwen asked.Because of Mu Chen and Mu Yan\u2019s laziness, the name of the snack bar in Taohua Village is simply three words \u201csnack bar\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s called a snack bar.\u201d Mu Yan returned, looking at He Jingwen puzzled, not understanding why he said that.The corner of He Jingwen\u2019s mouth twitched involuntarily, and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t you think the word \u201csnack shop\u201d is too simple?\u201dOf course, this is nothing in the countryside, but in the city, this name is too simple, so you have to think of a tall name, after all, this is the first snack bar in the city.\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Mu Yan blinked and said honestly.He Jingwen looked directly at Mu Chen, the meaning couldn\u2019t be more obvious, your wife doesn\u2019t know how to name her, and you won\u2019t play around with him, right? Then you come and give her a name.However, He Jingwen still underestimated how much Mu Chen doted on his wife.\u201cThe snack bar is very image, very good, no need to modify.\u201d Mu Chen saidroad.A small smile appeared on Mu Yan\u2019s face immediately, and he also felt that these three words were very good, as he could tell what store it was at a glance.He Jingwen has convinced them, and he no longer struggles with this issue. Fortunately, there is only this snack bar in the world, and no one will misunderstand him by calling him by his name.But what He Jingwen didn\u2019t expect was that even after decades, other snack bars opened one after another, with various names emerging one after another, but when someone said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the snack bar\u201d, they still couldn\u2019t believe it. Some people will have doubts and misunderstandings, and the first thing everyone thinks of is still the snack bar founded by Mu Yan.At that time, the word \u201csnack shop\u201d was already synonymous with the small shop opened by Mu Yan. When it comes to other people\u2019s shops, it must be \u201cXXX snack shop\u201d, but when only the word \u201csnack shop\u201d is mentioned , which means that what you want to go must be Mu Yanming\u2019s snacks.Of course, these are things for later.\u201cThat\u2019s the end of this problem. There is one more thing I want to discuss with you. On the day the snack bar opens, I hope that the two of you will come to cook. You also know that the word-of-mouth on the first day of opening is very important. I have never had a snack bar, but there are better ones, which will naturally attract more people to come, and it is also possible to let your apprentices come to cook in the future.\u201d He Jingwen said.\u201cEn.\u201d Mu Chen replied lightly.Although there is no other words, He Jingwen is relievedWhen the family of three came here, they took the bus, and when they went back, they drove their own car. This day, for Mu Yan, was very magical. I saw many things that I had never seen before, and I was very open. eyesight.The snack bar is open as usual on this day.\u201cLittle boss\u2026\u201d A customer hesitated to speak to Mu Yan. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Mu Yan asked puzzled.The customers who come to the snack bar are basically familiar customers, and everyone is familiar with each other, and they often chat with each other. Suddenly, they find that these customers are awkward, hesitant to speak, and Mu Yan is very uncomfortable.And there is more than one like this, and the wooden words made are even more confused.\u201cDid you also hear that rumor? Let me tell you, it\u2019s not credible at all, okay? Don\u2019t you know what kind of person the little boss is? It\u2019s not the first time you\u2019ve come to eat in the store up.\u201cA customer finally couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, and said to those hesitant customers.One person opened his mouth, and other people gradually began to discuss it, obviously everyone knew about it.\u201cThat\u2019s right, the little boss and the big boss are so kind, they make such delicious things, and they sell them so cheaply, what\u2019s your dissatisfaction?\u201d\u201cOf course we know that the bosses are very good, and we didn\u2019t believe the rumors, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d the customer who was hesitant to speak before retorted, his face flushed.\u201cWhat happened, can you tell me?\u201d Mu Yan stood aside and listened to their quarrel, but he couldn\u2019t understand what happened.\u201cLittle boss, to tell you the truth, there are rumors outside that the steamed stuffed buns and scallion pancakes you sell are all made of nutrition powder, and you deliberately use cheap nutrition powder to make money from everyone. Regarding this rumor, I have always been concerned about it.\u201d I never believed it.\u201d A young man hurriedly expressed his opinion, and the others immediately echoed.Only then did Mu Yan understand what happened.It turned out that there have been rumors about the snack bar in the past few days, and the most common rumors are probably that the snack bar is making black-hearted money.When the rumors started, no one can tell, but when they heard it, many people already knew it.Everyone says that the snacks made by Mu Yan are made with the cheapest nutritional powder, and then sold at high prices to people who don\u2019t know, and get huge profits from itNutrition powder is available in every family. It used to be a necessity for everyone\u2019s life, so the price is very cheap. Relatively speaking, the price of a steamed stuffed bun is not high, but compared with the cost of nutrition powder, it is still much higher. The families of ordinary people cannot eat every day.That\u2019s why everyone is so excited when rumors become popular.\u201cThe raw material of steamed stuffed bun scallion pancake is indeed nutrition powder.\u201d Mu Yan said very sincerely.In his opinion, these are all things to be taught to everyone in the future, and there is nothing to hide, but he doesn\u2019t know how much shock his words caused in the hearts of the people present.\u201cLittle, little boss, what are you talking about?\u201d Some customers didn\u2019t want to believe the rumor and struggled to confirm it again.\u201cLook, the little boss has admitted it. What else do you have to say? Selling the cheapest nutrition powder to us at a high price is simply a black-hearted businessman.\u201d Some customers took the opportunity to make trouble.Before the matter was confirmed, these people didn\u2019t dare to say anything. After all, there were still many loyal customers in the snack bar, but now that Mu Yan had admitted it himself, these people started to jump up and down as if fueling the flames.\u201cI really didn\u2019t expect that the delicious buns and scallion pancakes we ate were made of nutrition powder. How could this be possible? I have used various methods to make nutrition powder before, but I can\u2019t make such a taste at all. \u201cSome customers were purely surprised that the tasteless nutritional powder could make such delicious buns.\u201cLittle boss, how can you do this, even use the most inferior nutrition powder to make steamed stuffed buns, you are simply lying, liar!\u201d\u201cA store like this shouldn\u2019t exist at all. Who doesn\u2019t have nutrition powder at home, and even used nutrition powder to fool us. Unfortunately, I really thought these were some delicious things before.\u201dSome customers were more excited, and their words became more and more ugly. Even some other customers couldn\u2019t help frowning.\u201cEven if it\u2019s made with nutrition powder, can you say that the buns made by the little boss are not delicious? Can you make them yourself? Since you can\u2019t make them, don\u2019t compare them here.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, since your family has nutrition powder, why haven\u2019t I seen you make buns or scallion pancakes before? Since you are so good, don\u2019t come to the snack bar in the future.\u201d\u201cThese people are so unfamiliar. I haven\u2019t seen them before. Could it be that they came here on purpose to find fault?\u201d A customer said suddenly, and others noticed that these people were indeed relatively unfamiliar.Everyone is from the same village, and they often come to the snack bar to eat. The regular customers are very familiar with each other. Looking at these unfamiliar faces, the more I look at them, the more I feel that they are here to find fault.\u201cDon\u2019t let people tell you if you have done something wrong? This small shop is a black-hearted shop. I will never come here again, and I will let those who are deceived see clearly!\u201d The face-to-face customer choked. arrive.Mu Yan was caught in the middle, a little at a loss, he rarely encountered such a scene, and didn\u2019t know how to react for a while.Suddenly, Mu Yan felt a hand push him suddenly, he was still in a daze, he didn\u2019t notice at all, and he fell straight to the side.In a daze, he seemed to hear Ah Chen\u2019s cry, but the chattering voices around him gradually quieted down.The customers looked at the little boss who fell on the ground, but they didn\u2019t react for a while. Qiuqiu yelled anxiously beside him, and then Mu Chen came striding from the back kitchen, throwing the The collapsed Mu Yan hugged him, and looked around with that icy gaze. The customer who wanted to find fault with him suddenly became quiet, his body was shivering from the cold, and he didn\u2019t even dare to take a breath.Mu Chen didn\u2019t pause at all, and left the snack bar directly with Mu Yan in his arms. Zhang Mingfei and others hurriedly comforted the customers present, apologized to everyone, and sent them out. After all, the boss had left. He hasn\u2019t graduated yet, so naturally he can\u2019t entertain these customers.Most of the regular customers could understand and be considerate, and they walked out of the shop very consciously, and by the way, they also pulled out those who didn\u2019t know what they were interested in, just in time to settle the accounts just now!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 96": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Interstellar Cute Little HusbandChapter 97 - snack bar crisisPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAlthough the snack bar had many loyal customers and many people supported the snack bar at the time, but when the raw material of steamed stuffed buns and other staple foods turned out to be nutrition powder, and Mu Yan admitted it, it still affected the store\u2019s attendance rate.In the past, when the snack bar was not open for business hours, there was already a long line at the door of the store. Every time the snack bar opened, the inside was full. However, this day, the snack bar was open for the first time. There are empty seats in the store during peak hours.The snack bar was shrouded in a depressing atmosphere, whether it was the customers who were eating or the five waiters who were slightly relaxed, there was almost no communication with each other.The customers finished their breakfast in a hurry, and left this depressing environment impatiently, feeling that even the food in their mouths was not as delicious as before.Until sending away the last customer, Zhao Hanyuan finally couldn\u2019t control his temper, he slammed his fist on the table, his face was full of anger.\u201cDamn it, what the **** is going on?\u201dAlthough at the beginning they came to the snack bar to apply for the delicious three meals a day, but after working for so long, he gradually fell in love with the snack bar, especially the two bosses who devoted themselves to teaching them cooking skills, so that His sense of belonging to the snack bar became stronger.The leak of raw materials at the snack bar made him particularly worried and angry!Liu Hu rubbed the back of his head, with a worried expression on his simple and honest face, and said, \u201cWhat should we do, the number of customers coming these days has become less and less.\u201dEver since Mu Chen started to teach these people how to cook, everyone has regarded the snack bar as another home of their own. Now seeing that their cherished home has become depressed for some reason, everyone feels extremely uncomfortable.\u201cWhy are the raw materials of our snacks leaked? Generally speaking, it is impossible for them to know. Except for the two bosses, only we know.\u201d Zhang Mingfei asked puzzledly, turning his eyes back and forth on everyone. , but said nothing.The faces of several people became even worse, especially Li Hao, whose face was completely pale.\u201cWho on earth leaked this matter, you\u2019d better stand up yourself, otherwise if you let me know, you will never be spared!\u201d Zhao Hanyuan glared at the others angrily.Everyone can feel how kind the two bosses are to them, but in the end, such kindness has resulted in betrayal. What a blow to the bosses.For a chef, the raw materials and methods of making things are the basis of survival. If these are leaked, the snack bar may cease to exist.The five people are filled with righteous indignation here, wishing to find out the culprit now, but the other two biggest \u201cvictims\u201d are not as angry as they imagined.Regarding the leakage of nutritional powder raw materials, Mu Yan didn\u2019t feel anything serious, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have admitted it directly at the time, after all, he would tell everyone about it sooner or later, and for Mu Chen, as long as it was decided by Mu Yan, he would never admit it. 100% support, but he is very angry now.Because his Mumu was pushed down and injured by someone with bad intentions, which he couldn\u2019t bear no matter what.The closing of the snack bar means that everyone can get off work that day.Walking out of the snack bar, Li Hao\u2019s complexion was not very good, and he who was always talkative was unexpectedly silent today.\u201cMice, are you feeling unwell? Why do you look so bad?\u201d Zhang Mingfei, who had a good relationship with him, asked concerned.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Li Hao replied weakly.\u201cIf you feel uncomfortable, go to the hospital immediately, don\u2019t hold on.\u201cI see, thank you Ming Fei.\u201d Li Hao tried to smile, but that smile was uglier than crying.Although Zhang Mingfei was still worried, seeing Li Hao like this, he couldn\u2019t continue asking, so he had to leave first.Li Hao walked on the road in a daze, as if he had lost his soul. The images of the snack bar in the past few days kept playing in his mind, and what echoed was Zhao Hanyuan\u2019s questioning.Looking at the extended road without focus, he suddenly turned around at a fork in the road and walked in the completely opposite direction from home.No, he had to ask clearly, if\u2026 If it was true, he must not be able to escape.Li Hao seemed to have made up his mind, the speed of his feet became faster and faster, and he almost started to trot.\u201cSmell? Li Hao, why are you here?\u201d Yang Ping went out to buy things, but just after she came out, she saw Li Hao hovering in front of her house. She looked at him in surprise, a guilty conscience flashed in her eyes, and then she smiled.Li Hao stood in front of Yang Ping, staring straight at her, as if trying to see through her eyes.\u201cYou, what are you doing looking at me like that?\u201d Yang Ping was very uncomfortable being stared at by him, and moved to the side, trying to avoid Li Hao\u2019s sight.\u201cDid you tell me about the nutrition powder?\u201d Li Hao asked blankly, staring at Yang Ping closely, not missing any of her reactions, and a flash of injury flashed in his eyes.After thinking about it now, this is the only possibility, but Li Hao still prayed silently in his heart, not Yang Ping.\u201cWhat, what nutrition powder?\u201d Yang Ping turned her head slightly and replied uncomfortably.\u201cDid you tell me that steamed stuffed buns and scallion pancakes are made of nutrition powder?\u201d Li Hao asked again. Although he didn\u2019t want to believe it, Yang Ping\u2019s performance made his heart skip a beat. whereabouts.\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying at all? Get out of the way, I\u2019m going home.\u201d This is the first time Yang Ping was questioned by Li Hao in this way. No matter what she did before, Li Hao was very friendly, which made her temporarily I can\u2019t accept it.\u201cI only told you about this.\u201d Li Hao stopped staring at Yang Ping and said in a low voice, as if he was questioning Yang Ping, but more like questioning himself.He likes Yang Ping, he has never concealed this matter, and has been pursuing Yang Ping, so he will try his best to satisfy her whatever Yang Ping asks.They sat together and chatted for a long time that day, and they talked about many things. It was the first time he was able to sit down and chat with Yang Ping, so he was very happy and talked about many things unconsciously.It was also at that time that he accidentally told Yang Ping about the nutrition powder.After he finished speaking at that time, he actually regretted it, but when he thought that Yang Ping was the person he liked, if the pursuit was successful, he would be a family in the future. The boss said that he could tell his family.So at that time, Li Hao just told Yang Ping not to tell this matter, and Yang Ping agreed, so he was relieved, but he didn\u2019t expect that something like that would happen right after.Apart from the people in their store, only Yang Ping knew about this matter. If Yang Ping didn\u2019t tell it, who would it be?\u201cLi Hao, what do you mean by that? Are you doubting what I said?\u201d Yang Ping asked angrily, \u201cYou told me, but I also promised to keep it secret for you, so naturally I won\u2019t Tell it, everyone in your shop knows about it, who knows if they told it, you just come here to question me, don\u2019t you believe me so much?\u201dHearing Yang Ping\u2019s questioning, Li Hao panicked, but then he thought of what he said when they were together during the day.\u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone about the things in the store, not even my family members. These are the hard work of the bosses. We are lucky that they can guide us. How can I tell others? \u201cZhao Hanyuan was the first to express his opinion.\u201cMe too. Someone asked me, but I just didn\u2019t tell him.\u201d Liu Hu replied with a naive smile.\u201cI can swear that I never told anyone about this matter, otherwise I would be struck by lightning and die!\u201d Zhang Mingfei also said.Tao Qingran always said very little, but she immediately expressed her opinion, \u201cMe neither.\u201d\u201cMouse, what about you?\u201d After Zhao Hanyuan asked everyone, only Li Hao was left.Li Hao\u2019s face became even paler, because he said it, although he said it unintentionally, but he said it.Looking at the determined faces of his companions, Li Hao suddenly became timid and shook his head.The lying at that time made him suffer a lot. From the beginning, we became strangers because of the snack bar and became good friends. During the period of working in the snack bar, everyone got along very well and knew each other more or less. character.Liu Hu is honest and honest, and he can\u2019t tell lies. Although Zhang Mingfei is a funny person, he doesn\u2019t like to lie. Zhao Hanyuan is even more straightforward and violent. Instead of lying, he prefers to express his inner feelings directly. The people on the scene will be panicked and want to beat him up, but such a character makes people like him even more.Although Tao Qingran is usually very cold and doesn\u2019t like to talk, but he is mature and stable, and he doesn\u2019t even bother to tell lies.Therefore, although everyone has different personalities, there are also similarities, and it is precisely because of this that everyone can become friends.Since we are friends, we should not lie even more.The more Li Hao thought about it, the more he felt guilty about his previous hesitation and sorry for his friends.Seeing Yang Ping\u2019s angry and wronged expression now, it was rare for him not to comfort her immediately.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Li Hao apologized to Yang Ping, then turned and left.He must investigate this matter clearly, whether Yang Ping did it or not, he decided to tell his boss and friends about it, one more clue might make the investigation faster.After all, it was his fault that he revealed the raw materials privately, no matter how they punished him, he admitted it.After having such an idea, Li Hao felt that his heavy heart suddenly relaxed a lot.\u201cYanyan, what should we do? There are fewer and fewer customers now.\u201cNo. 5 kept going around in circles worryingly.Customers are the main part for them to complete the main task. If there are fewer and fewer customers, how can the snack bar continue to open in the future, and how to complete the task.Who on earth leaked their raw materials, it\u2019s really abominable!It\u2019s best not to let the great number five know, or he will definitely beat him up!\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d Mu Yan spread his hands, and quickly said with a smile: \u201cBut Chen must have a way.\u201dNumber Five: ..What does that proud expression of yours mean, what does that cheerful tone of yours mean, now it\u2019s a critical time, yet you still have the intention to show, show, and love there!Little host, wake up quickly, what can that big villain Mu Chen do, don\u2019t worship blindly like this, okay?Number Five felt so overwhelmed!\u201cAh Chen, what do you think we are going to do next?\u201d Mu Yan looked at Mu Chen expectantly.In his heart, Chen is omnipotent.Mu Chen lovingly rubbed Mu Yan\u2019s soft hair, and said with a smile: \u201cMu Mu already had a way to deal with it, didn\u2019t she?\u201dHearing this, Mu Yan\u2019s face flushed slightly, and he looked shy, and Number Five was going crazy watching it.Who can come and fork this dog couple out, what time is it, and they are still here to show their affection! Dog abuse is wrong!\u201cEn.\u201d Mu Yan responded in a low voice.\u201cMu Mu is really amazing, there will be a solution so soon.\u201d Mu Chen continued to praise Mu Yan, ignoring the battered No. 5 at all.\u201cCould you please tell me quickly?\u201d No. 5 gritted his teeth and tried hard to control himself to suppress the urge to go berserk.I really want to change the host TATI would like to change the host to a partner. What a mess, hurry up, wait online!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although the time has been advanced now, it does not conflict with the plan.\u201cWhat? Teach everyone?\u201d No. 5 opened his eyes wide and exclaimed in surprise.road.\u201cWell, instead of letting everyone guess like this, it\u2019s better to teach them directly. If they learn it, they will definitely teach it to more people in the future, so as to spread the food.\u201d Mu Yan said with a smile.\u201cBut\u2026but if this is the case, will there be fewer customers in the store?\u201d No. 5 was worried.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, then we\u2019ll go to Heyuan County.\u201d Mu Chen embraced Mu Yan, sniffed the fragrance intimately, and was in a good mood.If the small shops in the village really can\u2019t keep going, then they will go to the shops in Heyuan County.\u201cThat\u2019s right, we still have a store in Heyuan County, there are more people there, and more people will definitely know about the food by then.\u201d No. 5 was instantly happy, and excitedly continued to circle in mid-air. Just forget about the unhappiness.It has to be said that a small brain size is also beneficial.Now that there is a solution, Mu Yan and Mu Chen are not worrying about the snack bar, but are going to gather the villagers and teach them how to make nutrition powder.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, let Ming Fei and the others go to promote it.\u201d Mu Chen hugged Mu Yan and said, putting his chin on the other\u2019s neck, feeling the faint fragrance from the other\u2019s body, his heart was unexpectedly calm.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go and tell them tomorrow.\u201d Mu Yan also leaned on Mu Chen\u2019s body relaxedly, the two of them were full of warmth, and No. 5 had already gone to nowhere.The next day, before Mu Yan and Mu Chen came, Li Hao had already arrived at the door of the snack bar and waited.\u201cHuh? Mouse, why did you come so early?\u201d Zhang Mingfei came over and saw Li Hao standing in front of the snack bar with a sad face.\u201cI\u2019ll be here early if I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d Li Hao replied.\u201cDon\u2019t you have the key, why don\u2019t you go in?\u201d\u201cWaiting for you here.\u201d Li Hao said lightly.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to go in and wait.\u201d Zhang Mingfei had an intuition that something was about to happen, and his heart was pounding, but he didn\u2019t know what it would be.Zhang Mingfei took out the key to open the snack bar, followed by Li Hao, and the two silently cleaned the store.Tao Qingran, Zhao Hanyuan, and Liu Hu also came over one after another, and it was more than half an hour before work time.Li Hao took a few deep breaths, tried his best to make a psychological suggestion, and said, \u201cI have something I want to confess to everyone.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Zhang Mingfei\u2019s premonition was about to come true.The others also looked at Li Hao.Li Hao clenched his fists slightly, took another deep breath, and then said slowly: \u201cI told Yang Ping about the nutrition powder before\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? It turned out to be you!\u201d Zhao Hanyuan roared angrily, interrupted Li Hao\u2019s words directly, even raised his fist, and was about to rush over Zhang Mingfei and Liu Hu immediately grabbed Zhao Hanyuan and persuaded him, \u201cListen to him first. After speaking, don\u2019t be impulsive.\u201dZhao Hanyuan tried his best to control his temper, endured it and said: \u201cOkay, you continue to talk, if you really caused this incident, I will never forgive you.\u201d\u201cThat day\u2026\u201d Li Hao told several people about the incident of chatting with Yang Ping that day and accidentally revealing about the nutrition powder, with a guilty expression on his face, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s all my fault. It\u2019s too much to say.\u201dThe others also fell silent after hearing this. Everyone knew that Li Hao was pursuing Yang Ping\u2019s matter, and they usually helped out with advice, but they didn\u2019t expect to be involved in this matter.\u201cThe matter has not been investigated clearly, and it may not be Yang Ping who revealed it, but this matter is indeed your mistake, mouse, when the boss comes over, you go and apologize to them.\u201d Zhang Mingfei said.\u201cEn.\u201d Li Hao nodded in response.At this moment, Mu Yan\u2019s voice came, with a hint of doubt, \u201cWho do you want to apologize to?\u201d\u201cBoss.\u201d The five of them immediately turned around, saw Mu Chen coming in with Mu Yan in his arms, and immediately greeted him.\u201cYou guys came early, you don\u2019t have to work so hard, more sleep will be good for your health.\u201d Mu Yan looked at the five and a half boys, and said with concernWith a sore nose, Li Hao stepped forward and bowed deeply to Mu Yan, and then said, \u201cBoss, I\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have spoken out about the nutrition powder without authorization, I was wrong.\u201dMu Yan: \u201c???\u201d\u201cLittle boss, the rat didn\u2019t do it on purpose. He told Yang Ping about the nutrition powder, but he told Yang Ping alone.\u201d Zhang Mingfei hurriedly explained to his friend, but he didn\u2019t plead for mercy. The results were really bad.\u201cBoss, I don\u2019t know if Yang Ping leaked this matter, but I did something wrong, please punish me.\u201d Li Hao said heavily, maybe he would feel better after being punished.Mu Yan blinked, and it took a long time to realize what everyone was talking about, and said with a smile: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, anyway, I will tell everyone about this sooner or later, but it\u2019s ahead of time, and there is something I still need your help with. \u201c\u201cLittle boss, just tell me what\u2019s the matter.\u201d Zhang Mingfei responded immediately.\u201cI plan to tell the villagers how to knead the nutritional powder, and I need your help to spread the news to everyone. At 8 o\u2019clock tomorrow morning, at the entrance of the snack bar, I will personally teach you how to use the nutritional powder.\u201d Mu Yan said in a tone of wood. Said easily.\u201cLittle boss, is this true?\u201d After hearing this, several people were all surprised.\u201cOf course, so I need to trouble you.\u201d\u201cNo trouble, no trouble, but\u2026if everyone knows this method, won\u2019t there be fewer customers in the store in the future?\u201d Liu Hu raised everyone\u2019s concerns and questions.;Hmm\u2026 Probably not, we will continue to launch stir-fry series in the future, I think everyone will come to join us. \u201cMu Yan thought for a while and said.Most of the recipes I redeemed before were stir-fried dishes. They introduced one or two dishes before, and the results were not bad. If everyone only eats staple food in the future, you can still come to eat stir-fried vegetables.Hearing this, everyone really showed a relieved smile on their faces.\u201cLittle boss, you are amazing.\u201d Tao Qingran suddenly praisedIn the store, Tao Qingran was always aloof and silent, it was definitely rare to be able to speak up and praise someone like this.Mu Chen did not speak from the beginning to the end, letting Mu Yan decide. After the two bosses entered, the others discussed again, but the tone was not as heavy as before.\u201cMice, at least there was no loss this time, but you must remember in the future that you can\u2019t tell anyone about the store, including our family members.\u201d Zhang Mingfei said seriously.\u201c\u4ee5\u540e\u4f60\u82e5\u662f\u518d\u88ab\u7231\u60c5\u51b2\u660f\u5934\u8111\uff0c\u6211\u80af\u5b9a\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u63cd\u4f60\u3002\u201d\u8d75\u701a\u5143\u626c\u626c\u62f3\u5934\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u9053\u3002\u201cWell, I will definitely not make the same mistake again.\u201d Li Hao also saidSeriously guaranteed.Tao Qingran also spoke again in a rare way: \u201cThe little boss got through this crisis by himself.\u201d\u201cQing Ran, what does this mean?\u201d\u201cDo you really think that the boss\u2019s sudden desire to teach everyone about nutrition powder is a whim? If he doesn\u2019t teach you, everyone will only be more wary of the snack bar, and it will be even more detrimental to the snack bar. , On the contrary, if I teach it to everyone, everyone will have a better impression of the snack bar, and when the stir-fried dish series is launched, everyone will be more willing to come and join in.\u201d Tao Qingran rarely said so much at once, but after finishing speaking, he walked to the back Cook, help the two bosses prepare breakfast.It took the others to think for a long time before they understood the meaning. Especially for Li Hao, he was even more grateful and touched by the two bosses. After that, he naturally became more attentive and serious in doing things. Of course, all these That\u2019s another story.The little boss\u2019s order has already come down, and everyone will naturally go all out to help spread the word, not to mention that this is a matter that is beneficial to everyone. It takes almost no effort from a few people. Those who know the news will spread the word ten to ten Word spread, and in less than a day, everyone in Taohua Village knew that Mu Yan was going to teach everyone how to use nutritional powder to make delicious food.On the second day, countless people moved their small benches to the door of the snack bar early, waiting for Mu Yan and Mu Chen to arrive.Everyone sat together in twos and threes, and the topics of discussion were all about nutrition powder.\u201cMuyan is such a nice kid. He even took the initiative to teach us how to make nutrition powder. I went to their store to eat steamed buns before. The taste was really delicious.\u201d\u201cYeah, Mu Yan is such a good kid. I heard that the store was in crisis a few days ago. I don\u2019t know who leaked the nutrition powder. It\u2019s really wicked.\u201d\u201cThat is, since Mrs. Muyan came, our village has changed so much. Just eating, it is unprecedented. If it weren\u2019t for them, I don\u2019t know that there are so many delicious things in this world. .\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know what the little Boss Muyan thinks in his head to make such delicious buns with the simplest nutritional powder. I never knew that nutritional powder can be used in this way.Everyone was discussing in a hurry, with bright smiles on their faces, except for a few people.Yang Ping was one of them. She followed her family to wait outside the snack bar, but her pretty face was clouded.This time the matter was planned well, but unexpectedly, there was a change in the middle. First, Li Hao suspected her, and then Mu Yan spread such news, so that the snack bar and their reputation crisis went smoothly. It made her very unhappy.It was obvious that the goal would be achieved immediately, but unexpectedly, it would still fall short.The delicate little face became distorted due to anger and resentment, but at the next moment, an evil smile suddenly appeared.It\u2019s not a complete failure, is it?In the end, this recipe still has to be revealed to let everyone know, isn\u2019t it? She didn\u2019t believe it, if everyone learned it, would they still go to his snack bar to buy more expensive ones?Ah! Mu Yan is so naive, he gave this recipe to everyone, and everyone will make it by themselves, and it is definitely impossible to go to his snack bar. Although the reputation is preserved, the crisis is obviously bigger.It was so stupid, she wanted to see how he killed himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although Mu Yan said that he will teach everyone sooner or later, it is obvious that there may be his reasons for this ahead of time, so he blames himself very much.But except for these few people, everyone else is happy.As soon as eight o\u2019clock arrived, Mu Yan and Mu Chen appeared at the entrance of the snack bar on time, opened the snack bar, and took out a bag of nutritional powder and a large basin.Seeing the crowds of people outside, Mu Yan couldn\u2019t help being a little timid. Although he knew most of the villagers in Taohua Village, and he was very slick in greeting, he still felt a little shy when facing so many people at once.\u201cAh Chen\u2026\u201d Mu Yan gently tugged at the corner of Mu Chen\u2019s clothes, a trace of timidity appeared in his big eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, just pretend it\u2019s Ming Fei and the others sitting below.\u201d Mu Chen stroked Mu Yan\u2019s small head and comforted him.\u201cLittle boss, we are all by your side, and we will support you.\u201d Zhang Mingfei said immediately.\u201cLittle boss, don\u2019t worry, you can leave all trivial matters to me, and you just have to meet with me.\u201d Zhao Hanyuan smiled brilliantly, showing his white teeth.\u201cLittle boss, come on!\u201d\u201cLittle boss, come on!\u201d Everyone encouraged Mu YanCheer up.Mu Yan looked at everyone, looked at Mu Chen, and felt that his heart was filled with courage immediately, and walked out of the store with a little determination on his face, but when he saw everyone, his courage leaked a little bit.Mu Chen stepped forward, stood beside Mu Yan, and said, \u201cI believe everyone has heard about the nutrition powder some time ago. Since you want to know, we will teach you.\u201dMu Chen\u2019s cold words made some people blush immediately, wishing to hide behind their family and friends, not to let everyone see, especially those regular customers who haven\u2019t come these days.However, Mu Chen didn\u2019t care about other people\u2019s reactions. After speaking, he stood a little behind Mu Yan and accompanied Mu Yan in the posture of a guardian.With Ah Chen by his side, Mu Yan felt that he was braver, and then said: \u201cBefore making bun skins and scallion pancakes, you need to knead the dough first, pour an appropriate amount of nutritional powder into the basin, and then slowly add water to it , don\u2019t add too much at one time, or it will be too thin, and you won\u2019t be able to condense into a dough. Of course, if you accidentally add too much water, you can also add some nutrition powder into it.\u201d\u201cWait to this extent,\u201d Mu Yan tilted the basin and showed it to everyone. There are already condensed nutrient powders and some nutrient powders scattered in it, and continued: \u201cAt this time, all the Knead all the nutrition powder together, and try to let the scattered nutrition powder stick to it, if there is too much scattered, you can add some water until it is all kneaded into a ball, which is basically completed. \u201cMu Yan skillfully and quickly kneaded the nutrient powder into a dough, and the washbasin, which was still stained with a lot of nutrient powder just now, became smooth and clean, and could be put away without cleaning.Everyone looked very seriously below, especially those housewives who were not even willing to blink their eyes. They couldn\u2019t wait to write down every word Mu Yan said.\u201cAfter kneading the dough in the basin, you need to continue kneading on the panel, so that the air in the dough can be kneaded out, making the dough stronger.\u201d Mu Yan kneaded the dough very skillfully and quickly. His hands are like obedient children, allowing him to flatten and round them.\u201cMu Yan, can you move a little slower? Auntie is getting old, and her eyes can\u2019t keep up.\u201d An aunt in her fifties said with a smile. \u201cOkay, then I will slow down.\u201d Mu Yan smiled shyly, slowed down the kneading movement, and explained to everyone the small details that need to be paid attention to in detail every time.\u201cIs this the prototype of the steamed stuffed bun? But it doesn\u2019t look like it. Isn\u2019t the steamed stuffed bun filled with stuffing?\u201d There was an abrupt voice in the crowd, and the natural questioning voice instantly caused many people to frown and frown. with displeasure.\u201cBaozi still needs some other steps, and I will show it to you later.\u201d Mu Yan said calmly.During this process, he gradually became more confident, perhaps because he had achieved what he was good at, and he was no longer as timid as he was at the beginning.\u201cThe dough is kneaded. This is the most basic step in making all kinds of pasta. Next, I will show you how to make scallion pancakes.\u201d Mu Yan divided the dough into two equal parts, planning to use one to make scallion pancakes. One serving is for buns.The method of scallion pancakes is relatively simple. You only need to divide the dough into equal parts, spread them flat, add some seasonings, and then spread them on the pan.\u201cIs scallion pancakes that simple?\u201d\u201cIt turns out that the scallion pancakes are actually made this way. It seems quite simple.\u201d\u201cMuyan is really amazing. If you don\u2019t show it to us, we don\u2019t even know that nutrition powder can be eaten like this.\u201d\u201cHeh, you are really amazing. How dare you cheat everyone out of so much money with such a simple thing that everyone can do?\u201d Another discordant voice came from the crowd, full of sarcasm.\u201cIf the little boss doesn\u2019t show it to you, do you know that nutrition powder can still be done in this way? If you are not convinced, then don\u2019t come and see it. You should also try to make it yourself. While enjoying the fruits of other people\u2019s labor, you can\u2019t help it. Willing to pay the price, how can there be such a good thing in the world.\u201d Zhao Hanyuan directly sarcastically said.Because there were too many people below, everyone was trying to get close to Mu Yan and the others, and wanted to see the steps carefully. Therefore, everyone couldn\u2019t identify who the person who just spoke was for a while.\u201cThat is, the little boss can think that this is worth rewarding in itself, and if he is not willing to pay, then don\u2019t come to eat in the future, and don\u2019t come to see it now.\u201d\u201cNow the forest is really big and there are all kinds of birds. This kind of lazy temperament, you can tell that he is not a good person at a glance.\u201dSome villagers also started talking, obviously feeling bad about the person who spoke.That person didn\u2019t speak anymore, probably because he was worried that he would be recognized when he was speaking, and he would definitely not get any good fruit.\u201cLittle boss, don\u2019t pay attention to those people. We all support you. These results are all your research. As a result, we are now enjoying your efforts for no reason. I am really ashamed.\u201dEveryone heard this person\u2019s words, and the scene suddenly fell silent. Before, everyone was excited because they were about to learn the method of eating nutrition powder, but they forgot how much energy it takes to study these methods, and they just like this This result was accepted as a matter of course.Now that I think about it, I really feel guilty.Most of the people in Taohua Village are simple and kind. They can\u2019t do this kind of things that they take for granted, but they are not willing to give up learning how to make steamed stuffed buns and scallion pancakes. They are a little entangled for a while.However, there are also many people who secretly made up their minds that they must visit the snack bar more and bring business to the snack bar in the future, and as long as Mu Yan Muchen needs help, they will definitely not refuse, and they will go back to see if there is any help. There is nothing to return the gift.After all, this gift is too great.\u201cI am very happy that everyone can eat delicious food and know how to make their own food. After all, it is better for everyone to enjoy good things together.\u201d Mu Yan said sincerely, because he really thought so, and the purpose of the system This is also the case, and it does not conflict with his ideas and practices.But in everyone\u2019s ears, it was shocked and moved.\u201cThe little boss is so kind. I thought the little boss sold cheap nutrition powder at a high price before, and I blamed him. Now that I think about it, I\u2019m so ashamed that I want to crawl into the cracks in the ground.\u201d A young man suddenly covered his face. , said embarrassingly.Immediately afterwards, one after another, people began to confess with dry faces. Most of them were young people, and they were also regular customers of the snack bar, but they rarely appeared these days.But what do the people below think, Mu Yan continued his presentation, the scallion pancakes have been displayed, and the steamed buns are next.\u201cThe making of steamed stuffed buns is more complicated than that of scallion pancakes. The dough needs to be smaller, and then the skin should be rolled out. The skin should not be too thin, so that it is easy to break when stuffing, but it should not be too thick. It is best to be thick in the middle and thin on both sides. That\u2019s it.\u201d Mu Yan said while doing a demonstration, rolling out one and showing it to everyone.\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t prepare the stuffing today, I\u2019ll use this whole piece to demonstrate to everyone.\u201d Mu Yan picked up the radish that Mu Chen had just cut casually and said, then put the radish in the middle of the bun skin, pinched the edges skillfully, Soon a white and fat cute bun was completed.This is the first time for everyone to see the production process of buns and scallion pancakes with their own eyes. During this period, there will be a burst of exclamation from time to time.Obviously it looks like such a simple nutrition powder, but in Mu Yan\u2019s hands, it turns into something completely different in minutes, and they have tried these steamed buns and scallion pancakes, and the taste is better than pure nutrition powder It\u2019s really amazing to eat so much.Zhao Hanyuan and others looked at the amazed expressions of the people below, and a sense of superiority rose from their hearts.They have been watching the two bosses make buns in the kitchen every day these days, and the speed of their hands is definitely not comparable to today\u2019s.Under the operation of the nimble fingers, the gentle bun skin quickly turned into beautiful folds. With a turn of the hand, beautiful and lovely buns were produced one after another. Watching the two bosses making buns was almost like It\u2019s like enjoying an art performance.What\u2019s wrong with today\u2019s performances? Unfortunately, these people are destined to not be able to see the little boss\u2019s performance.So how lucky they are.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look difficult.\u201d Another discordant voice sounded, and everyone ignored that person directly, staring closely at the stage.When Zhao Hanyuan and the others heard this sentence, they couldn\u2019t help pulling the corners of their mouths and revealing a mocking smile.not difficult? It\u2019s really not difficult to watch the little boss do it, but when you really do it yourself, you will know the difficulty. Just putting stuff on the side can drive people crazy.They\u2019ve been in the kitchen for several days, and they still can\u2019t pinch the edges well. They should really let these people come up and try to see if they can still stand and talk so calmly without back pain!\u201cLittle boss, you are so amazing. I don\u2019t know how to praise you anymore. Please take my knee. From now on, I will be your brainless fan.\u201d A young man suddenly said loudly, even really single He got down on his knees, with fanatical admiration on his face.There was a sudden burst of booing from the crowd.Seeing this, Mu Yan was a little at a loss, while Mu Chen\u2019s entire face was darkened, and he walked off the stage holding Mu Yan\u2019s hand without even saying a word.\u201cThat\u2019s it for today, everyone can go back and practice on their own.\u201d Tao Qingran had no choice but to step forward and say, it\u2019s not good to keep all these people here.Several other people were not idle either, they were busy packing up those nutritional powders and potsThe two bosses left directly, and they could only clean up the mess.The villagers are all immersed in the joy of learning steamed stuffed buns and scallion pancakes at the moment, and they don\u2019t mind Mu Chen and Mu Yan\u2019s last impolite behavior. After Tao Qingran announced the end, they couldn\u2019t wait to rush home, wanting to Hurry up and try it yourself.This is a move of great significance to them, to Taohua Village, and even to the whole world!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you think no one will come to the store today?\u201d Zhao Hanyuan asked worriedly.He never thought that one day he would worry about having no customers in the store.You know, in the past, they never worried about no customers in their store, only worried about too many customers.\u201cShould\u2026 no?\u201d Zhang Mingfei obviously lacked confidence in what he said.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s all my fault.\u201d Li Hao said with his head down, feeling extremely guilty.\u201cThe matter has not been investigated clearly, and it may not be Yang Ping who said it. Don\u2019t always blame yourself.\u201d Zhang Mingfei comforted his friend.Although the facts have not been clarified now, Yang Ping\u2019s suspicion is probably the biggest. After all, except for Li Hao who told Yang Ping, no one else has ever told anyone about it.\u201cSince the boss has figured out this method to solve it, what we have to do is not to feel guilty, but to work harder to repay the boss.\u201d Tao Qingran said coldly, his voice was like jade beads falling on a plate, clear and sweet.\u201cYes, it\u2019s useless to blame yourself now, we must find a way to make up for the lost customers.\u201d Zhang Mingfei also said.\u201cI\u2019m a stupid person, and I can\u2019t think of any good methods, but if you think about it, I will definitely work hard to do it.\u201d Liu Hu scratched his head and said naively.It was almost time for the store to open, and the five of them looked at the empty store entrance, feeling very uncomfortable.\u201cWhy are you standing here?\u201d When Mu Yan came over, he happened to see Tao Qingran and the other five standing at the door, as if they were welcoming guests.\u201cLittle boss, good morning.\u201d Everyone greeted Mu Yan.\u201cGood morning.\u201d Mu Yan also replied with a smile, and then took the lead to enter the shop, as if he didn\u2019t notice that the shop was empty.Several people looked at me and I looked at you, all hesitating and not knowing how to comfort the little boss.\u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten breakfast yet, let me make it for you, a new breakfast.\u201cMu Yan said with a playful smile, and then walked into the back kitchen.\u201cDid the little boss talk about a new breakfast just now? Did the little boss come up with a new breakfast?\u201d Zhang Mingfei asked hastily.\u201cI heard it just now. I don\u2019t know what the new breakfast is like. The new food that the little boss comes up with is always very delicious, and it refreshes my knowledge every time.\u201d Zhao Hanyuan also said.\u201cIf there is a new breakfast, the previous customers will definitely come to taste it if they know about it. Even if they know how to make buns and scallion pancakes, they will definitely want to try the new food.\u201dAs soon as Zhang Mingfei said these words, the eyes of the others lit up immediately, and the expressions of worry all morning finally cleared up.\u201cI said, why does the little boss suddenly want to disclose the matter of nutrition powder? It turns out that he has planned it for a long time. The little boss is really awesome!\u201d Zhao Hanyuan couldn\u2019t help but admire.Tao Qingran couldn\u2019t help but gave him a big roll of eyes.Here, the atmosphere among the five people became more and more lively, while in the kitchen, Mu Yan clicked on the system page, and then called up a new food recipe, counting the ingredients according to the above.Just when Mu Yan decided to disclose the methods of making steamed stuffed buns and scallion pancakes, system upgrade reminders and rewards followed. The new recipes made him very excited, and he became more determined to disclose the methods of using the nutrition powder.\u201cYanyan, let\u2019s make it with flour today, and make sure to surprise those customers and let them know that flour is still the most authentic way to make steamed stuffed buns and scallion pancakes.\u201d No. 5 said passionately. A little brooding.Although it is a matter of time before these recipes are published, it is very uncomfortable to be forced to publish them for other reasons!\u201cThe amount of flour is limited. Use it after the next wheat harvest. The remaining flour will be made for you to eat.\u201d Mu Yan comforted with a smile.No. 5 was really happy when he heard the words, and kept circling around Mu YanAfter Mu Yan prepared the ingredients, he took a look at the recipe and was ready to start cooking.\u201cAdd yeast powder to the milk first, and stir well.\u201d No. 5\u2019s tender voice sounded, helping Mu Yan read the steps in the recipe.There is no milk for the time being, but Mu Yan asked Mu Chen to catch a creature similar to a cow, and then squeezed out its milk to use as milkHeat the milk until lukewarm, then add the yeast powder and stir.\u201cIn the second step, add the milk to the flour, stir as you add it, and knead the dough by hand.\u201dThis step should not be too proficient for Mu Yan, it will be done in minutes, because milk is added to the dough, there is a faint milky smell, and the dough is also milky white, which makes people unable to help but move their index fingers.Looking at the dough, No. 5 swallowed quietly, and tried to turn his eyes back to the recipe, \u201cStep 3, cover the dough with a damp cloth and ferment until it doubles in size.\u201d\u201cLet it ferment first, let\u2019s do other things.\u201d Mu Yan put the dough aside, then opened the bag he brought, and inside was the familiar white rice.\u201cYanyan, what shall we do next?\u201d No. 5 looked at Rice and asked curiously.It knows that this is obtained after planting the rice they discovered before, but it doesn\u2019t know what delicious food it can make, and now it is very much looking forward to it.\u201cIt\u2019s morning, let\u2019s make porridge.\u201d Mu Yan said.Because the amount of rice is limited and there are many people, it is the most cost-effective to make porridge to drink.Mu Yan looked at the rice with keen eyes. He hasn\u2019t eaten rice for a long time. Even in their world, he rarely had the opportunity to eat white rice. After all, the price of rice is still very expensive. Generally, people in the village eat brown rice, and those who are a little richer will mix some rice.It is completely fine rice like now, this is definitely the first time Mu Yan has the opportunity to eat it.Mu Yan carefully scooped out the rice, not wasting a single grain of rice, then put an appropriate amount of water on it, and put it on the stove to boil over low heat.Afterwards, I took the time to make some porridge-friendly side dishes. At this time, the fermented dough has almost doubled in size.\u201cYanyan, the dough is fermented, we can continue.\u201d No. 5 looked at the dough and said to Mu Yan, and then continued to read the fourth step of the recipe, \u201cStir the lye with salt, dip your hands in the lye, Dip it and knead the dough until it is fully kneaded, then cover it with a damp cloth again, and wait for the dough to double in size after the second proofing.\u201d\u201cI have to wake up again, when will I be able to eat it?\u201d No. 5 stared at the recipe resentfully.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Chen and Qiuqiu haven\u2019t come yet, and the porridge isn\u2019t ready yet, it will be soon.\u201d Mu Yan comforted the other party.The water in the pot gradually boiled, and the aroma of rice porridge slowly spread out, permeating the entire kitchen, and even wafting into the hall outsideThere is nothing added to the porridge, only rice, even so, for those who have never eaten rice, the fragrance of rice is enough to arouse people\u2019s appetite.\u201cIt smells so good, what on earth is the little boss doing? How can it be so fragrant?\u201d Zhao Hanyuan stared at the kitchen door eagerly, with an expression of wishing he could get smaller and get in to see what\u2019s going on, which made people laugh.\u201cIt smells so good, it must be very delicious.\u201d Liu Hu sniffed vigorously intoxicated to capture the faint fragrance.\u201cThe little boss must have discovered new ingredients. This smell has never been smelled before.\u201d Zhang Mingfei also said.\u201cThe little boss is really amazing.\u201d After so many days, Li Hao finally showed a smile on his face.Although Tao Qingran said nothing coldly, his softened expression had already betrayed his thoughts at the moment.Mu Yan didn\u2019t know how intoxicated the outsiders were. After the dough woke up for the second time, he could continue with the next steps.Mu Yan brushed a thin layer of oil on the stove to prevent the dough from sticking to it later, then rolled the dough on the operating table into strips about 5 cm wide, then cut them into pieces about 1 cm long, and then Superimpose the two doses and press the middle with chopsticks.Pour the oil into the pot, heat it well, turn the heat to medium heat, and when the oil in the pot is 50% hot, twist the agent several times and put it into the pot, turn it over with chopsticks, and deep-fry until golden brown Ready to serve.The long and fat one is obviously the most popular fried dough stick in the earth age.Golden in color, oily but not greasy, with a little milky aromaJust smelling it makes my mouth water.\u201cLittle boss, what are you doing, why is it so fragrant?\u201cZhao Hanyuan\u2019s slightly eager voice sounded outside the door, even mixed with the sound of swallowing saliva.Originally, when the faint fragrance wafted in, everyone felt hungry, but the little boss didn\u2019t come out, and it was not easy for them to go in. As a result, when the smell of fried dough sticks came out, their stomachs began to growl in protest. The saliva couldn\u2019t help swallowing one mouthful after another.They could barely hold back the fragrance of the porridge, but the deep-fried dough sticks had a unique aroma, which was really hard to hold back.\u201cIt will be ready soon.\u201d Mu Yan responded, while frying the fritters quickly and skillfully, even though it was the first time, it was as skillful as if he had done it many times.Mu Yan found that his current level of cooking has improved a lot compared to the beginning, and he doesn\u2019t know whether it is because he has done too much or because of systematic bonuses.\u201cNo, I have to go outside and stay, otherwise I\u2019m really worried that I can\u2019t help but rush in.\u201d After turning N circles in place, Zhao Hanyuan began to walk towards the outside of the store at an increasingly faster speed, as if there was someone behind him. Something is chasing him.\u201cI\u2019m going too, wait for me.\u201d Zhang Mingfei couldn\u2019t control himself anymore, and immediately followed him out, and the others followed one after another.The five people looked at each other, and they all saw covetousness and excitement in each other\u2019s eyes, and they no longer had any worries before.\u201cHuh? Why are you all outside? Is the snack bar closed today?\u201d Seeing Zhang Mingfei and the others, a middle-aged man asked puzzledly, with a hint of anxiety in his tone.Before the five people answered, a few more people came over one after another, and all of them were regular customers of the snack bar, and they came in the direction of the snack bar.\u201cAre the two bosses here today? What are you selling for breakfast today?\u201d A regular customer asked, and the others couldn\u2019t help but crane their necks to look inside, only to find that there was no one inside.\u201cIt\u2019s not really closed today, is it? I haven\u2019t eaten breakfast yet, so I\u2019m waiting to come over to eat.\u201d Someone was anxious.\u201cMe too, the store is closed, so I\u2019m going to be hungry.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Are the two bosses busy today?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Everyone talked in a hurry, not giving Zhang Mingfei and others a chance to speak.Of course, these five people were also a little confused.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Interstellar Cute Little HusbandChapter 101 - substantive grievancesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt\u2019s been half an hour since the business hours, but not a single customer came. Everyone thought that there were no customers today, but so many came all at once, as if they had negotiated.\u201cWhat\u2019s the smell? It smells so good!\u201d Suddenly, a customer with a sharper nose sniffled, and the strong fragrance kept surrounding him, seducing him.Afterwards, one after another, everyone smelled the smell, and couldn\u2019t help but walk along the smell, and found that the smell came from the store, and they were overjoyed, rushing to the store, the scene was more than before. Even more hot.\u201cHey, don\u2019t squeeze, the door will be damaged by you.\u201d Li Hao looked at the fragile door worriedly and reminded.It\u2019s a pity that the customers who were tempted by the fragrance didn\u2019t have time to pay him any attention, they just wanted to go in quickly, and then see the source of the fragrance, it\u2019s best to be able to eat it.Seeing the customers swarming outside, Tao Qingran and the others were dumbfounded.If they didn\u2019t know that Little Boss\u2019s new food hadn\u2019t been officially released, they would have thought that these people came to the snack bar with such a tacit understanding because of the news of the new food.\u201cWhat should I do? I thought there would be no customers coming today, so the little boss might not have prepared enough?\u201d Liu Hu said worriedly.\u201cOops, what the little boss is doing now is for us!\u201d Zhao Hanyuan suddenly shouted.The five people looked at each other, woke up suddenly, and immediately squeezed in.These customers are really disgusting. Why don\u2019t you come earlier or later? It\u2019s too much to rush to come at this time!So, after Mu Yan made the porridge and deep-fried dough sticks, he walked out of the kitchen, and this was what he saw.Everyone crowded at the door, desperately trying to squeeze in, but because there were too many people and everyone refused to give in to each other, they could only squeeze together, and everyone was squeezed until their faces were red and their necks were thick.\u201cBoss, we\u2019re here for breakfast. What did you make just now? It smells so good!\u201d The customers who squeezed in front saw Mu Yan, their eyes lit up, and they shouted vigorously. It\u2019s like swallowing wooden words.Both Mu Yan and Number Five couldn\u2019t help but took a step back.Words, words, these people are scary, we\u2026\u201d Looking at the excited customers, No. 5 immediately thought of a man-eating monster. I couldn\u2019t help shivering.\u201cNo. 5, No. 5, what should we do?\u201d Mu Yan was obviously also frightened by this scene, retreated into the kitchen, and closed the kitchen door firmly, but the voice continued to come in through the door.\u201cI, I don\u2019t know either.\u201d\u201cIt would be great if Ah Chen was here.\u201d Mu Yan thought of Ah Chen\u2019s broad chest and tall figure, and he always felt particularly safe by his side.When No. 5 heard the words, he immediately said: \u201cYanyan, hold on first, I\u2019ll go find that big villain.\u201dAfter finishing speaking, No. 5 flew out of the window directly, leaving Mu Yan completely unresponsive.The battle at the gate was obviously getting more and more intense. Everyone was squeezing hard, and everyone was blushing and thick-necked. People who didn\u2019t know thought that these were Mu Yan\u2019s enemies who came to seek revenge.\u201cLittle boss, open the door, what delicious food did you make, quickly take it out, I want to buy it!\u201d The customer who finally squeezed in ahead immediately ran to the place where the kitchen and the hall are connected, and patted them vigorously.\u201cLittle boss, you can\u2019t hide your secrets. We haven\u2019t had breakfast yet.\u201d\u201cLittle boss\u2026\u201dA few people in front of them started to beat the door, but they didn\u2019t notice that the noisy voice behind them gradually disappeared, and there was nothing else around except their voices.\u201cLittle boss, ah!\u201d A customer screamed, feeling his whole body vacated, and flew straight back.The other excited people froze subconsciously when they heard the words, and looked around in a daze, and then saw Mu Chen\u2019s cold and temperatureless face, they fell silent immediately, and didn\u2019t even dare to move .Mu Chen didn\u2019t stop because of their \u201cknowledge\u201d. The few people in front who managed to squeeze in were thrown out by Mu Chen in an instant like a chicken.And those who were guarding the door consciously gave way to these people, and then blocked the door again, but this time no one dared to push forward.The five of Zhang Mingfei finally squeezed into the shop out of breath, holding the table with their hands and gasping for breath. It was the first time they had seen a scene like today, and it was even crazier than when the snack bar opened on the first day.\u201c\u549a\u549a\u549a\u201d sounded knocking on the door, and Mu Yan\u2019s body became stiffer immediately, and his alert state had reached the highest level. However, the sound he heard at the next moment made him immediately lose all his strength. If Mu Chen hadn\u2019t just come in After catching the falling body, I am afraid that I will have an intimate contact with the earth.\u201cAchen\u2026\u201d Mu Yan called out weakly, this time he was obviously quite frightened.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m here.\u201d Mu Chen hugged him into his arms, comforting him in a warm voice, but his gaze towards the customers behind him was extremely cold, full of thick threats, completely different from his gentle tone at the moment. match.The customers were like well-behaved quails, and they no longer had the excitement and drive they had before. After calming down, seeing Mu Yan was frightened, they were filled with self-blame and guilt.\u201cCome in and take these out.\u201d Mu Chen said to Tao Qingran and the others.The five of them had to enter the kitchen immediately, not daring to look carelessly, and could only secretly watch the two kinds of food on the stove that had never been seen before, which has always been the culprit for such scenes.The warm porridge and deep-fried dough sticks, the aroma has not yet dissipated, constantly lingering on the tip of the nose, constantly tempting them.Tao Qingran and the others kept hinting to themselves in their hearts and tried their best to control themselves, so they reluctantly didn\u2019t pounce on them, but took out the porridge and fried dough sticks.The moment the other customers came out of the food, their gazes were fixed on it. The salivating expression and the wolf-like eyes simply took a toll on their image.Although everyone can\u2019t wait to taste it, but because Mu Chen is here, no one dares to go forward.\u201cThis, is this today\u2019s breakfast?\u201d A bold customer asked tremblingly, while the others pricked up their ears and listened carefully.The hall was extremely quiet, except for the sound of someone swallowing saliva from time to time.Zhang Mingfei and the others couldn\u2019t decide whether they would be sold or not, so they had to look at Mu Chen.\u201cTwenty credits for a bowl, twenty credits for a stick.\u201d Mu Chen said in a cold voice, ignoring the wailing voices of those customers after hearing the price.Seeing Mu Chen\u2019s determination to not change, everyone knew that the other party was still angry, and these prices were raised in a fit of anger. The original price must not have been so much, but no one dared to express their inner feelings. dissatisfied.Look at Mu Chen, look at Mu Yan, look at the deep-fried dough sticks and porridge that kept tempting them, and finally had to accept being slaughtered willingly, who made them scare the little boss, who made the big boss a madman protecting his wife Woolen clothEveryone can only regret their previous impulses in their hearts.However, after Zhen gritted his teeth and bought the porridge and fried dough sticks, and tasted the taste, the regrets and dissatisfaction in everyone\u2019s hearts disappeared, and only the sound of drinking porridge and fried dough sticks remained.Zhang Mingfei and the others saw that their breakfast was snatched away by these uninvited guests, and the resentment in their hearts almost turned into substance.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious. It\u2019s better than all the ones I\u2019ve eaten before. It\u2019s so delicious! A customer took a bite of the fried dough sticks, and there was a scent of oil.The taste exploded in the mouth in an instant. After taking a sip of the porridge, the combination of strong aroma and lightness made it so delicious that I wanted to swallow it with my tongue.\u201cThis porridge is eaten with side dishes. It really whets my appetite. I think if you give me another ten bowls, I can eat them all.\u201d Another customer couldn\u2019t help but praise.Hearing that the other customers who failed to grab it, they wished they could step forward and tear him up.\u201cIf you don\u2019t hurry up, I\u2019ll grab it.\u201d A customer who didn\u2019t buy breakfast said sinisterly, and the others were also staring at those lucky customers.And the customers who were lucky enough to buy breakfast didn\u2019t bother to express their opinions at the moment, and hurriedly stuffed the porridge and fried dough sticks into their mouths, for fear that those people really couldn\u2019t help but come forward to grab them. This kind of thing may happen in other people\u2019s stores. It won\u2019t happen, but here, there is nothing they dare not do if they can\u2019t think of itIn Mu Chen\u2019s warm and familiar embrace, and under the soft and gentle comfort of the other party, Mu Yan finally recovered. Only then did he realize that he was hugging Ah Chen in front of a large crowd, and immediately retreated blushing. The heat on his face It has not been able to dissipate for a long time.\u201cBoss, do you still have porridge and fried dough sticks?\u201d Seeing that Mu Yan had recovered, a sharp-eyed customer asked tentatively.\u201cNo more.\u201d Mu Yan replied in a low voice.These were not planned to be launched so soon, especially the rice porridge. After all, there is not much rice. If it is released, it will probably be eaten up in a few days.That\u2019s because when he came here this morning, the five guys were obviously not in a good mood. In order to mobilize their emotions, he thought of doing this temporarily, but he didn\u2019t expect so many customers to come just after finishing it.\u201cLittle boss, this is not enough to eat. We still have so many people who haven\u2019t eaten it. Can you make some more? It\u2019s fine if it\u2019s more expensive.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, little boss, just make a little bit, at least let us all have a taste.\u201dSome customers who didn\u2019t eat it hurriedly echoed, seeing the look of those who had eaten so eager to lick their bowls clean, they felt that their mouths were flooding.Those who have eaten or are eating have also pricked up their ears. Although they didn\u2019t join in, they are also hoping that the little boss can make something. After all, they haven\u2019t eaten enough at all, and they are also turning quickly Brain, thinking about how to buy a copy later.Mu Chen stared over, those customers who wanted to say something at first shut up immediately, it was more effective than the words of the superiors at work.However, these wooden words did not notice, but said: \u201cRight now there are not enough raw materials, and there is only a little rice. We will not continue to make porridge until the next time the rice is ripe, but we can make some fried dough sticks.\u201dThe other customers heard that although they really wanted to drink some porridge, if they continued to entangle, they might lose even the fritters. The small boss is easy to talk to, but the big boss is not so easy to talk to.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
