    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 16 - One-horn (1)\u201c\u2026that\u2019s strange.\u201d\u201cI know, right.\u201d\u300eWhat\u2019s strange?\u300fThe Heavenly Demon slowly lifted his head up from his book, and Cha Jeong-woo nodded as if in agreement. Shanon gazed in their direction. Although he couldn\u2019t make a facial expression since he did not have a proper physical face, Shanon started firing out questions to seek clarity on the two\u2019s conversation. Moreover, based on Nocturne\u2019s facial expression, it seemed Nocturne knew something as well. The matter seemed to be serious, as everyone\u2019s expression hardened.\u201cYeah. Something\u2019s off.\u201d\u300eWait, something is off? Tell me, what\u2019s so strange?\u300fShanon looked towards Nocturne and asked, but Nocturne only looked back at the Heavenly Demon and Cha Jeong-woo with a serious expression.\u201cDid this ever happen in the previous \u2018wheel\u2019?\u201d\u201cNo. Absolutely not. This is a first.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026!\u201d\u201cCould it possibly be an aftereffect of me dividing the worlds?\u201d\u201cNo. Even if the worlds are divided, they are all still within the confines of the \u2018wheel\u2019. Thus, this anomaly phenomenon is specifically occurring within this unique context.\u201d\u201cI have no idea how this could happen\u2026\u201dThe Heavenly Demon, Cha Jeong-woo, and Nocturne were busy exchanging words with one another. In addition, they were using difficult terms that made it hard for Shanon to follow their conversation. Shanon was only able to pick up on the aforementioned quotes. For a moment, Shanon felt as though he was being singled out from the conversation.\u300eHey, tell me!\u300fThe three, who were in deep discussion, quickly swung their heads toward Shanon.\u300eTell me, too! I\u2019m so curious that I feel like I\u2019m going to go mad!\u300fShanon almost seemed to be begging. Based on his personality, Shanon\u2019s inability to intervene in their conversation was nothing less than psychological torture.Only after hearing Shanon\u2019s outburst did Cha Jeong-woo realize his mistake. Jeong-woo scratched his temple with his index finger. If one started a conversation while omitting the subject, it was obvious that most people would not be able to follow the conversation. And since the Heavenly Demon and himself were the librarians in charge of the Changgong Library, their understanding of the world was beyond the level of a creation god.On the other hand, Shanon had only lived as a familiar of the Black King. Moreover, Shanon was not interested in headache inducing issues, such as understanding the world or the secrets of the creation of the universe. Thus, it was easy for Jeong-woo to empathize that Shanon was getting frustrated by their seemingly convoluted conversation.Jeong-woo contemplated where he should start his explanation. While contemplating how to best explain the situation, Cha Jeong-woo decided to just state the main points. \u201cDo you know what emperors are?\u201d\u300eYeah, I know. I\u2019ve even used it in some of my tunes.\u300f Shanon answered proudly. Emperor Temper was one of his more upbeat and often sung songs.Cha Jeong-woo shook his head to shake off the strange feeling of the Emperor Temper's song\u2019s melody and lyrics creeping into his mind. An emperor is a being who is completely free from the countless iterations of the \u2018wheel\u2019 and freed from the laws of the world and the constraints of Ideas. No matter how the \u2018wheel\u2019 turns and no matter if another universe begins, the existence of an emperor does not disappear. This fact remains even though the \u00a0concept of the \u2018wheel\u2019 has largely disappeared and only the division of the worlds remains.\u201dThe division of the world could be understood as a multiverse or parallel universes. Assuming that there was a person, \u2018a\u2019, the universe in which \u2018a\u2019 exists could be expressed as \u2018A\u2019. Here, \u2018a\u2019 was placed in a relative context based on a certain point in time, and depending on the choices \u2018a\u2019 makes, the universe could take on a slightly different appearance. For convenience, let\u2019s call this alternate universe that appeared due to the choice \u2018a\u2019 makes as alternate A.Alternate A would have an appearance that\u2019s not significantly different from A. There was only a slight difference. However, when \u2018a\u2019 faced another moment of choice, another alternate A would arise, followed by another alternate universe and another. In this way, \u2018parallel universes\u2019 were established, exponentially growing into an innumerable number of alternate universes.Thus, the critical problem arose. If there was a parallel universe called A-10 that originated from a singular choice, followed by other successive choices, from the universe called A, could alternate A-10 still be called a parallel universe of A?The answer was \u2018no\u2019. The universe called A-10 would have a completely different appearance, as it would have undergone substantial transformation. It would be more appropriate to denote this universe as \u2018B\u2019.In other words, \u2018B\u2019 was a \u2018multiverse\u2019 that is different from A. Based on this line of reasoning, C would be created after B, and then D, E, F... They would be created successively. Thus, universes exponentially would grow in number, creating parallel universes and multiverses. Moreover, these universes repeatedly collapsed as well.Infinity (\u221e)... In the end, so many universes would fill up the \u2018wheel\u2019 and \u2018the world\u2019. Reaching the limitations of this constantly expanding number of universes was unavoidable, even for transcendent beings such as gods and demons. In the first place, the essential existence of gods and demons themselves were like \u2018laws\u2019 imprinted on the universe in which they existed. The gods and demons thus referred to their \u2018laws\u2019 as divine positions.These gods and demons called themselves \u2018transcendents\u2019. In Cha Jeong-woo\u2019s view, these so-called \u2018transcendents\u2019 were nothing more than blubbering idiots who self-restricted themselves to obtain a few abilities and skills. After all, if there was \u2018Zeus\u2019 in the world of A, there would also be a Zeus with a similar personality and divine position in alternate A.However, beings who deviated from even the laws of a world and achieved complete \u2018transcendence\u2019. These beings were freed from the limitations of parallel and multiple universes, and were fully independent. Even if one were able to observe all the universes, one would not be able to find them. Rather, the beings would be above all the universes. These beings were known as emperors.Throughout the long history of the \u2018wheel\u2019, there have only been a few beings who achieved the \u2018emperor status. They possessed omnipotence and omniscience. They were beings who had everything.However, one problem arose.\u201cWhat will happen after an emperor dies?\u201d\u300e\u2026uh?\u300f It was then that Shanon realized something was off. Having heard Jeong-woo\u2019s explanation, Shanon had an inkling of what logical conclusion Jeong-woo was alluding to.\u300eWell, in the Martial King\u2019s case\u2026\u300f\u201cYes, he did become an emperor. He attained the level as his powers dramatically increased, but his rising powers also reinforced and strengthened Gaia\u2019s curse, which eventually caused his demise.\u201d\u300eWait\u2026 Something is off!\u300f Shanon\u2019s voice quavered.\u300eDidn\u2019t you just explain that a transcendent being is above all else? You said they\u2019re fully independent! They\u2019re like a singularity! And since they\u2019re above the universes, their existence eventually becomes forgotten to the beings inhabiting each universe, no?\u300fShanon still vividly remembered the day when Yeon-woo became the complete Black King after slaying Sage/Yvlke and cleaning up all the associated legends. Shanon did not forget that Yeon-woo had to also face the unfortunate consequences of his actions\u2026That would be the dilemma of having to become a person who no longer existed in the world, as Yeon-woo was now completely free from the \u2018wheel\u2019. And because he loved his family more than anything, Yeon-woo chose to sacrifice himself to create a world where his family could live in peace, even if it meant that he would be completely forgotten. And it took Yeon-woo countless attempts and an absorbent amount of effort and time to return to this world.In that process, Cha Jeong-woo, following after the Heavenly Demon, became an official ambassador to manage the Changgong Library. Furthermore, only after Jeong-woo had acquired the ridiculous divine name of \u2018Deus Ex Machina\u2019 was he able to pull Yeon-woo out of the swamp of the abyss/void.In other words, though emperors denoted independence and uniqueness, it was more like a curse than a blessing. At least, this was what Shanon thought.In Shanon\u2019s eyes, the Martial King had been promoted to become such an emperor at least for a brief moment in time.\u300eTo become a being a unique being and then completely disappear\u2026 Doesn\u2019t that mean complete elimination? But, the Martial King\u2026\u300f\u201cHe existed. He even looked the same as he did right before he disappeared.\u201d\u300e\u2026\u300f\u201cOriginally, even if Hyung and Phante rewound the \u2018wheel\u2019, they shouldn\u2019t have been able to meet the Martial King. Moreover, those in the One-horned Tribe shouldn\u2019t have been able to possess their memories of the Martial King\u2026or he may have just been remembered as a great ancestor of theirs who passed long ago.\u201dWorshiping of the Heavenly Demon was common in many universes. However, the exact name and the legends that constituted him were different. The King of the Underworld, the Supreme Light, the light that defeats darkness, the messenger of civilization, the Heavenly Demon, the father of Day\u2026 These were all words and descriptions that alluded to either light or death.It was the same with the Black King. Each remained in a different form within each universe, so Jeong-woo had his hands full to try and find a \u2018Cha Yeon-woo\u2019 that most resembled his brother\u2026 Thus, it should have been the same case for the Martial King. However, the Martial King was present in the One-horned Tribe. Moreover, he was the exact same being as before.\u201cBut another issue here is that\u2026there is no way that Hyung is unaware of this discrepancy.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon nodded in agreement. Since Yeon-woo suffered so much, the Heavenly Demon believed that Yeon-woo absolutely knew what it meant to be an emperor. Thus, Yeon-woo must have already had some idea of why the Martial King existed as he did.\u300e\u2026this damn boss of mine.\u300fCrack.\u00a0Though Shanon apparently had no mouth, the sound of grinding teeth seemed to be coming from his being.\u300eHe\u2019s up to something again, right?\u300fCha Jeong-woo gave a bitter smile as he reluctantly nodded. They were all having a similar thought.\u201cHe always wanted to put everything back in its original place. He wanted to bring back all the beings and things that disappeared or suffered after everything went wrong. He probably also wanted to enjoy a bit of happiness.\u201dThe sudden disappearance of Yeon-woo was more likely an absence rather than a disappearance, and a voluntary absence at that.\u201cThe existence of the Martial King\u2026may be related to what he\u2019s doing right now.\u201dThe problem was no one had any idea how Yeon-woo was carrying out this plan. How was an eliminated being brought back? How was the Martial King returned back into the \u2018wheel\u2019? However, one could speculate that the method was not yet perfect, which was why the Psychic Medium\u2019s divination stated that the Martial King would be eliminated by a \u2018mortal\u2019. After all, the Martial King should not have even been able to exist.\u2018Damn it\u2026 Would it really hurt to give us a heads-up before going off?\u2019 Cha Jeong-woo mumbled while recalling his brother\u2019s stubborn and unyielding personality. No matter how old Yeon-woo became, no matter how many years had passed, it did not seem like his brother\u2019s personality or temper would ever change.***Going back to the book, the time zone zipped forward and stopped at the time just after Yeon-woo and the Martial King\u2019s reunion.\u201c\u2026Ugh! That guy! How could a disciple not understand his master\u2019s feelings?\u201d The Martial King was grumbling.Originally, the Martial King was looking forward to having a nice fight with Yeon-woo, not a duel with Phante. The way the Martial King saw it, Yeon-woo\u2019s understanding of martial arts was so deep that it was difficult for even the Martial King to measure or grasp. Not only was Yeon-woo\u2019s power level high, but his spirit awareness was also far beyond any general level. Yeon-woo had clearly reached a state that only beings who had been patiently and repeatedly experienced and learned for a long period of time.And to that extent, it seemed that Yeon-woo had already established his own path. The Martial King tried to recall what Yeon-woo had called his attack\u2026 Was it called Sword Thunder? Anyway, the Martial King was interested in the mechanics of Yeon-woo\u2019s attack since it seemed to utilize darkness with relative ease.However, the Martial King was not able to get what he wanted in the end. Whenever the Martial King launched an attack on Yeon-woo, Yeon-woo would just \u2018nullify\u2019 the Martial King\u2019s attacks.\u201cHey, fight properly!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not here to fight.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you know that I\u2019m a peace-loving being?\u201d\u201cScrew you\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201dThe Martial King was dumbfounded at his disciple\u2019s nerve and brazenness to babble such nonsense with a straight face.\u201cHow could I, a disciple of yours, ever consider raising a hand towards such an\u2026 Ahem\u2026 Esteemed master\u2026 Ahem\u2026 Hahaha. Ah, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cWhether to be truly sorry or laugh\u2026 You should choose one.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 I\u2019ll just laugh\u2026 Hahaha.\u201d\u201cThis little turd.\u201d\u201cIf you want to reach my level, master, you\u2019ll have to live another million years at least.\u201dHearing the same line that he previously used to always tell Yeon-woo spoken back to him by none other than Yeon-woo, the Martial King could not help but make a stupefied expression. Shitty luck\u2026 This was the first thought that popped into the Martial King\u2019s mind. The problem was that he knew his other disciples, his children, and the members of his tribe must have felt the exact same way whenever he stated that line. But still. Even though he made others feel this way, he was not willing to be on the receiving end.\u300eDo you know what a hypocrite is?\u300f\u201cI know. It\u2019s what I am.\u201d\u300e\u2026Well, I guess it\u2019s good that you know.\u300fThe Psychic Medium could only laugh at the Martial King\u2019s frank answer. What other answer was she supposed to expect from her husband? He could do it, but others could not\u2026 This was what her husband had always said. At the same time, she admired how her husband did not waver or concern himself too much with her divination.Although he seemed overly arrogant and petty sometimes, the Martial King was very wise. This was probably why the Martial King looked so free and unencumbered. And this was the quality that made the Psychic Medium fall in love with the Martial King during their youth.\u300eStill\u2026 If only he could be a bit more reflective and understanding\u2026\u300f\u201cHuh? Did you say something?\u201d\u300eNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u300f***\u201cPlease come in.\u201d\u201cUh, yeah\u2026\u201dWith a nervous expression, Yeon-woo followed a shy Edora to her room. However, Yeon-woo soon stopped in his tracks.\u00a0Whoosh!\u00a0The moment he took a whiff of a peppermint smell, which was coming through Edora\u2019s bedroom door, Yeon-woo\u2019s mind went blank.\u00a0Gulp.\u00a0Yeon-woo audibly gulped.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 23 - One-horn (8)In fact, as Yeon-woo stated at the beginning, he had no desire to fight with the Martial King. No matter how great the Martial King was, since he had not achieved exuviation and transcendence, he would be no match for Yeon-woo. Moreover, as long as he was \u2018subordinated\u2019 to this world and subjected to the restrictions of all entities within a universe, the Martial King could not surpass Yeon-woo.However, Yeon-woo did not want to see the others see the Martial King being defeated, so Yeon-woo had avoided conflict as much as possible.\u2018Still.\u2019 There was one thing that Yeon-woo had overlooked about his own resolve. \u2018I\u2019m curious.\u2019After all, before becoming the Black King, Yeon-woo was a martial artist by trade. Although he learned martial arts to avenge his younger brother, he found the craft fun, so he was able to develop to where he was now. Moreover, after the Martial King was annihilated, Yeon-woo used to play numerous imaginative battles with the Martial King in his mind. As far as he knew, the strongest being in the world of this Tower was the Martial King.Perhaps that was why a lingering thought stuck in Yeon-woo\u2019s mind. If only his real master had remained alive, if Yeon-woo had a chance to compete with him in martial arts\u2026 Yeon-woo would be able to know where he stood in terms of martial arts ability. What would the result have been?***\u201cMaster.\u201dRumble!\u00a0Yeon-woo lightly waved his hand in the air, then he erected a light pillar that stretched from the ground to the sky. A swarm of lights soared up into the air with a colossal roar, seemingly shattering the space. It was such a dazzling sight that it seemed as if a star had fallen from the sky. However, the Martial King did not so much as bat an eyelid.At the same time, a strange thing occurred. Two voices could be heard very clearly, despite the many roars that resounded in succession around them. They were probably still able to clearly communicate because the two had reached a point where they were no longer restricted by space.\u201cWhy are you calling me suddenly? What? Are you going to ask me to go easy on you?\u201d Thinking this was nonsense, the Martial King snorted and avoided the pillar of light. He rushed towards Yeon-woo with a single breath. Raising his hand high into the air, the Martial King made a slashing move. However, unlike the simple movement of his hand, the attack was anything but \u2018simple\u2019 and \u2018light\u2019.Break Heaven. While chasing after Shaohao Jintian, the Martial King had created his own martial art, the eight Extreme Fists. Break Heaven was the first of the eight fists, and it was imbued within the Martial King\u2019s current attack. Yeon-woo had personally seen the move cut the sun in half in the past.If he were to be hit by the attack, his head would be split in half.Sensing danger, Yeon-woo contorted his body to the side to avoid the oncoming attack. However, the word \u2018heaven\u2019 in Break Heaven did not simply mean the \u2018sky\u2019. It included the physical rules surrounding the space and the providence of the world beyond it. Break Heaven contained the power to cut off all these principles. In fact, beyond the torn space, Yeon-woo could see Idea rapidly disintegrating and cracks spreading in all directions.\u2018You\u2019re so good at doing such unspeakable things.\u2019 Yeon-woo was careful and mindful of the attack. He did not take it lightly. If he were to be hit by the attack, he would get hurt. This was because his true body, not just the one that he used to descend to this world, would be affected by the attack. Thus, it was natural that Yeon-woo felt a cool tingle run up his spine. Still, Yeon-woo could not help a smile from forming on his lips.This\u2026was the true power of the Martial King. It was completely different from the technique that Yeon-woo had seen in his previous battles with the Martial King. The Martial King was doing his best\u2026 He was going all out. This meant that he had begun to regard his disciple as an equal.Such a fact made Yeon-woo very happy. Having run in circles, but finally, he gained the \u2018recognition\u2019 he long sought after from his master. It was a very precious personal joy that could be replaced with anything else.Of course, this did not mean that Yeon-woo would commit the mistake of being swayed by his emotions. He did not want to waste this precious opportunity and he knew very well that, if there was one thing he had neglected, he had not been polite to his master. Therefore, Yeon-woo wanted to show the Martial King the martial arts that he had accumulated so far. He could not draw out all his power, as the Tower would collapse. However, it was possible to extract a singular part of a legend and implement it in the form of an ideology.[Most of your powers are locked!][The legend of the Black King has fallen into a light sleep.][Data related to martial arts is loading.]Boom! Boom! Boom! Whoosh!\u00a0Yeon-woo and the Martial King exchanged blows at a fast pace. Their attacks and counters were at a speed that could not be followed by an ordinary person\u2019s eyesight. Though they had spent their entire lives practicing martial arts, even the tribe members found it impossible to follow the progression of attacks.Yeon-woo could not be happier with the pain that rang out every time he bumped into the Martial King\u2019s limbs. His mind had been released. It felt like all the senses that had been dormant since Yeon-woo began to be recognized by the world had been newly awakened.The Martial King forcibly pulled out every drop of his martial arts prowess. Thanks to this, Yeon-woo was able to clearly see the shape of the Martial King\u2019s martial arts. Yeon-woo was able to peer into the Martial King\u2019s past and observe the latent potential within the Martial King. It was like a lesson for Yeon-woo. The ideas and theories that he had of certain martials art principles were cleared away in an instant.Bam!\u00a0Yeon-woo\u2019s movements, which seemed completely different, soon became very similar to that of the Martial King\u2019s. If the Martial King stretched out his hand, Yeon-woo would follow suit and strike with the same attack. If the Martial King kicked with his leg, Yeon-woo would also use his leg in the same way to interrupt the attack. It was as if a mirror had been placed between the two.At this moment, Yeon-woo was completely engrossed in the martial arts he practiced and the martial arts the Martial King was showing. However, the Martial King felt a little different. Surprisingly, the Martial King continued to smile leisurely even as he was bumping into Yeon-woo with all his might. Not only that, but he also had the wherewithal to joke around. He was not pretending to be strong. This was just the beginning.Yeon-woo also smiled, expressing utter bliss. \u201cSurely, you don\u2019t think I\u2019d come all the way here and ask you to go easy on me, right?\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cI am speaking for Edora\u2019s sake.\u201dThe Martial King frowned. \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about?\u201d\u201cAfter I get married, master will have cute grandchildren\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t it be a bit embarrassing if you greet your grandchildren with a few missing teeth during the holidays?\u201d\u201cHmpf!\u201dYeon-woo continued to pour out provocation after provocation. The Martial King was not amused. Though Yeon-woo had initially joked around to rile him up, now, it was getting to the point of dragging the Martial King\u2019s entire image down.\u201cDisciple. Has your bad temper gotten even nastier? Your every word is filled with such poison.\u201d\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t thought about that. But do you know something?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBefore, there were a lot of things I wanted to say to you, but I suppressed those urges. Now, it\u2019s all just exploding out.\u201d\u201cSo, you feel comfortable enough to speak freely now, huh?\u201dWhoosh!\u00a0The Martial King fell silent for a moment. The offensive, which had been continually coming out like water falling from a waterfall, abruptly stopped. Suddenly everything fell silent, as if a mute button had been pressed. Just a moment ago, the loud noises were so great that one would have thought one\u2019s hearing might have been lost forever.Though it fell quiet, Yeon-woo knew that this was just the calm before the storm. Thus, he mentally prepared for what was to come. Yeon-woo mirrored the Martial King\u2019s next move.Actually, it was not an exact mirroring. Until now, Yeon-woo had focused on bringing out his own martial art senses from copying the Martial King\u2019s moves, but now, Yeon-woo had reached a level where he now wanted to organize and refine those martial art principles. Thus\u2026he brought out the only martial arts principle that he had created, \u2018Eight Extremes of Sword Thunder.\u2019Crackle!\u00a0Black and red flames jumped out like sparks from the tip of his index finger. Yeon-woo clenched his fists with only the index and middle fingers open.This was Finger Sword Art, a method that Yeon-woo had created to replace a sword when there was no sword in his hand. Since Vigrid was the only sword that Yeon-woo found suitable for his hands, Yeon-woo had created this method to replace Vigrid when he did not have it in his possession, as Yeon-woo had no plan to utilize any other sword.Crackle.\u00a0The lightning started sparking all over the place. Yeon-woo crossed his arms as he held his finger sword. The world was engulfed in darkness by an explosion of power that was incomparable to what the Monkey King\u2019s exuviate had once shown.[Using the authority of the super administrator to completely separate the surrounding space from the Tower!]However, before detonating the sword thunder, Yeon-woo cut off the space where he and the Martial King were fighting from the outside world. He did not want the One-horned Tribe\u2019s village to be damaged.Rumble!\u2018Will master be able to stop this attack?\u2019 Yeon-woo thought that the Martial King would be able to parry the sword thunder strike. The Martial King was a being who led Asgard to destruction, even while he was under the influence of Gaia\u2019s curse. Thus, Yeon-woo was confident that his master would be able to block his attack. As expected\u2026Boom! Boom!\u00a0The moment the Martial King stepped on the ground, waves spread out in concentric circles, shaking the surrounding area violently. The sword thunder strikes that were flying towards him disappeared mid-air. While neutralizing the attack, the Martial King had sent out his own crushing attack.On the surface, the attack looked like a simple stab, but in Yeon-woo\u2019s eyes, the oncoming attack looked like a ferocious beast with its teeth angrily exposed. Yeon-woo was surprised. Although he expected the Martial King to parry the sword thunder strike without much difficulty, his master had done so with utter ease.Moreover, using the Crushing skill with his left hand, the Martial King seemed to have increased his power by swallowing up the remaining energy left by the first extreme sword thunder strike.Seeing this, Yeon-woo turned his finger sword in another direction and started his second extreme sword thunder strike. It was an attack equivalent to twice the power of the first extreme. With this attack, Yeon-woo felt confident that Crushing would no longer be a viable counter for the Martial King.Boom!\u00a0However, it seemed that Yeon-woo had been mistaken. Even with the second extreme, the power of Crushing did not diminish, let alone the speed, so Yeon-woo was once again surprised. He soon unloaded with third and fourth extreme attacks in succession.Boom! Boom! Whoosh!\u00a0Yeon-woo was only able to neutralize Crushing once he threw out the fifth extreme. At that moment, Yeon-woo felt an eerie feeling. Even if most of his powers had been locked, a power level of the fifth extreme was enough to shake Asgard to its foundations, but how was the Martial King able to\u2026? Before Yeon-woo could complete his thoughts\u2026\u201cIf you turn an eye during a fight, you know you\u2019ll get hurt, right?\u201d The Martial King suddenly appeared behind Yeon-woo and smiled coldly.\u2018Were my senses fooled?\u2019 Yeon-woo opened his eyes wide and quickly turned his body. His finger sword flared and crackled with lightning. The sixth extreme was enough to collapse an entire stage, nay, it would be able to cause a significant crack on the Tower.Boom!\u00a0The Martial King did not avoid the explosion. Rather, he reached out with his hand. He pierced through the lightning without hesitation and grabbed Yeon-woo\u2019s right wrist.Yeon-woo would be on the losing end of this fight if he had his wrist caught. In order to ward off the Martial King\u2019s hand, Yeon-woo used the blade of his relatively free left hand to stab down on the Martial King\u2019s hand. However, rather than avoid the attack, the Martial King pushed himself closer to Yeon-woo, stubbornly digging into Yeon-woo\u2019s side.Boom! Boom!\u00a0In the blink of an eye, the hands and arms of the two people got entangled, as limbs started colliding all over the place. Then, when Yeon-woo detonated another sword thunder strike, the Martial King released all the magic energy in his body at once, creating a self-defense force and repelling Yeon-woo\u2019s offensive attack.Boom! Rumble! Rumble! Crackle!\u00a0The flames surrounding the two soared high into the air before swirling around like a tornado and disappearing. It was a true battle, not a spar.Yeon-woo instantly understood something. \u2018Master\u2026is still making progress.\u2019The Martial King\u2019s attack a moment ago would have overpowered the previous emperor-level Martial King who had driven Asgard to their end many years ago. Though the Martial King was showing signs of struggle, he was still able to repel Yeon-woo\u2019s attack.How could this be possible? The Martial King in front of Yeon-woo was the Martial King, but he was also not the Martial King. The existence in front of him was an imperfect existence. Nevertheless, the Martial King persevered, and soon, he devised a counterattack.The counterattack was something Yeon-woo had seen once before. On the twenty-first floor. It was the same attack the Martial King\u2019s copy had used in the \u2018Shadow Dojo\u2019. Although the Martial King in the Shadow Dojo was just composed of past data within the Tower\u2019s system, the Martial King copy had exhibited signs of transcending existing restrictions and conditions from its existing data. Such was the case here as well.At this very moment, the Martial King was getting stronger at a very fast rate. An imperfect being? What did that mean? In the end, he was still the Martial King, the king of martial arts. He was overcoming all the restrictions and limitations that should have been placed on him. He was born with so many talents that he could not possibly have been a mortal, but those innate talents had been forcefully suppressed by an immovable wall, Allforone. The Martial King\u2019s potential was only allowed to explode because he met a stimulant named \u2018Yeon-woo\u2019.Having met a being greater than Allforone, the Martial King was starting to open his eyes. His past common sense and worldview, which had set Allforone as an existence that could not be overcome, collapsed at once, and as he acquired a new perspective, his innate talents were also expanding at an exponential rate.It was like how Yeon-woo was bringing out his martial art achievements while fighting against the Martial King. The Martial King was expanding his achievements, which had previously been suppressed, while fighting with Yeon-woo. If he had been born in a different world, this would have likely been his true image!Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh![Player \u2018Nayu\u2019 is changing!]Escape. Trance. Rising in the world. Reaching one\u2019s top line. Nirvana. All these expressions fit the description for what the Martial King was currently achieving. The Martial King was immersed in a form of trance as he entered a completely different world.\u2018That\u2019s why.\u2019 Yeon-woo was able to intuitively realize what position he should take. Originally, the purpose would have been to compete using martial arts, but this only suited the Martial King\u2019s position. If Yeon-woo were to happen to lose, he thought he may truly lose his mind\u2026 At least, this was what Yeon-woo thought.\u2018Ugh\u2026 People with talent. Tsk.\u2019Some beings lived life overcoming hardship after hardship to acquire what they needed while others were born with a silver spoon, or few, in their mouth. Yeon-woo smiled brightly, spread his hands wide, and covered the Martial King. The eighth extreme of\u2026\u00a0Rumble.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He felt as though it would have been easier fighting against Sage/Yvlke in the swamp of the abyss/void than to be in his current situation. It was not like he had never dated before\u2026 If others were to know how he felt at this moment, they might think that he had never been in a relationship.Although Yeon-woo had already shared a deep relationship with Edora, that was a long time ago. Yeon-woo had long forgotten how it felt at that time. Or perhaps, he felt that it was more difficult this time around because of his previous experience, as his relationship with Edora was cherished and precious. Yeon-woo had been yearning for this moment for so long. Essentially, this was why Yeon-woo felt so nervous.Yeon-woo was afraid to touch Edora, as he felt he might somehow hurt her. He was afraid that Edora might crumble like a sandcastle and disappear, as if all this was just a mirage or dream. He was scared that he would lose Edora once more. This ordinary happiness, something he had always longed for\u2026 At the moment, everything felt a bit much for Yeon-woo to handle.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026a little cluttered in here, huh? I was in a hurry to tidy things up\u2026but it hasn\u2019t been easy. Hahaha\u2026\u201d Edora also seemed to be nervous. It was the first time she had invited Yeon-woo into her own bedroom. If Yeon-woo had pretended as if everything was alright, Edora felt she would be able to act comfortably as well, but Yeon-woo\u2019s face had turned beet red the moment he met her, so she felt the same awkward nervousness.Edora saw her worn socks peeking underneath the bed, so she hastily kicked them further in. She did not want to present anything unsightly. She did not want to show her lover anything that might seem crass or cluttered.\u201cUm, uh, um\u2026! My, why is it so hot in here. May I bring you something to drink? Oh right. What was I thinking? I prepared some fruit beforehand. I\u2019ll bring some over right now.\u201d \u00a0If she stayed in the room any longer, Edora felt like she would explode. While constantly chattering, not knowing what she was talking about, Edora was about to leave the room to go get something. She seemed to have thought that the awkwardness would disappear if she brought something to eat.\u201c\u2026Yeon-woo?\u201d Edora spoke as she tried to pass by Yeon-woo. But before she could get past him, Yeon-woo had extended his hand and grabbed Edora\u2019s wrist. Edora looked up at Yeon-woo with a perplexed gaze but soon found herself taking in a sharp breath.Yeon-woo had pulled on Edora\u2019s wrist and brought her into his arms.\u00a0Whoosh. Her face fell against his chest. Yeon-woo\u2019s chest was as hard as a wall, but Edora somehow felt that the embrace was soft and warm. And moments later\u2026she regained clarity.Edora was in Yeon-woo\u2019s embrace. At that moment, Edora recalled that Yeon-woo was a head taller than herself, and his broad shoulders and long-reaching arms held her in his embrace easily. His breath was ticklish and warm.\u201cI missed you.\u201d Yeon-woo\u2019s voice came through with so much warmth that Edora felt it had reached the deepest regions of her heart. No other words were necessary. Yeon-woo\u2019s three words conveyed the sincerity that was deeply buried within him. Yeon-woo had fought day after day just for the chance to stand next to Edora, so he had rushed over to see her as soon as he could.\u201cMe too. I missed you as well.\u201d Edora felt the same. No other words were needed. She raised her face, which was deeply buried in his chest, and looked up at Yeon-woo. She reached out and gently stroked his face. Every time her fingertips caressed his eyes, nose, lips, cheeks, chin, and ears, Yeon-woo felt his heart pounding heavier.\u201cAt first, I resented you a lot. How could you just walk away without a word? I wondered how you could just leave me hanging. What girl in today\u2019s modern world just waits for someone\u2026so I constantly thought about you and what may be happening to you several times a day.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cShould I just give up on this relationship? Maybe waiting was just stupid. I wondered if it had become a habit and lifestyle choice to just keep waiting all the time. Perhaps I was just repeating a meaningless daily life. However\u2026\u201d Edora\u2019s expression relaxed as she broke into a smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to give up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSometimes, when I thought of you, I felt annoyed and wanted to meet you at least one last time to express my anger\u2026 But after that time passed, I just longed to see your face.\u201d Edora wanted to see Yeon-woo, and that hope was the driving force that kept her going. \u201cHaving you right in front of me has dispelled all the anger that I previously carried. This is probably why they say one should not like the other more in a relationship. A couple needs to push and pull evenly.\u201d\u201c\u2026if we did that, it would break my heart. I don\u2019t think I could be as strong as you.\u201d\u201cI know it probably hasn\u2019t been easy for you as well, but you know that I\u2019ve stewed inside for a long time, right? Now that we\u2019ve gotten this out, maybe we should spar and release our anger a little\u2026\u201d\u201cWait, that\u2019s\u2026!\u201d Yeon-woo did not immediately respond as he wondered if Edora was serious. Though he wanted to stop her, Yeon-woo felt that he owed Edora whatever she wanted if she truly wanted to do something.Seeing Yeon-woo act this way, Edora smiled. Though she heard about his outside actions, such as becoming the Black King, stabbing people in the back, showing his temperamental side, and all kinds of other news, Yeon-woo had always acted weak in front of her. Edora felt that Yeon-woo looked too cute, so she decided to forgive him this one time. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to go off somewhere again, right?\u201d\u201cOf course not. I have nowhere else to go anyway.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d As the mood and tension had been released, Edora started chattering in a relaxed manner. Or perhaps it was because she knew she possessed the initiative between the two.At that moment, as he looked into Edora\u2019s eyes, Yeon-woo discovered a mischievous side that he had never seen in Edora before. It was as if she was a little devil trying to play a funny prank.Edora grabbed Yeon-woo by the collar and pulled him in towards her. His face got close enough to hers that he could feel her breath. Yeon-woo blushed, feeling embarrassed. And the more Yeon-woo acted this way, the more brazen Edora became.\u201cSince you\u2019re finally here\u2026\u201dWhile saying this, Edora pushed Yeon-woo with all her might.\u00a0Plop. Yeon-woo landed on Edora\u2019s soft bed.\u201cE-Edora?\u201d Yeon-woo was at a loss for words. If Yeon-woo did not want to fall backwards, he could have regained his balance with ease. However, Yeon-woo felt that he should not attempt to go against Edora\u2019s lead. No, it was probably more accurate to say that he did not have the wherewithal to even consider any thoughts or actions. And without realizing what was going on, Edora had taken the upper hand and had plopped herself atop Yeon-woo.Yeon-woo felt that Edora\u2019s face, as she looked down on him, seemed to reflect a more wicked, devilish side of her. It was as if she was a starved person in front of a delicious dinner. Yeon-woo, who was essentially as helpless as a lamb, was driven into a corner. Edora had become the salivating wolf.\u201cI\u2019m going to tightly tie your hands and feet so you can\u2019t go anywhere anymore.\u201d Edora foretold the fate and future that Yeon-woo had no choice but to go along with, and a seemingly endless and sleepless night had begun.***\u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wanting to ask.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAfter that one moment that seemed to have no end in sight, Yeon-woo and Edora had a whispered conversation as they continued to embrace each other tightly under the sheets. They talked about what they had been through and shared their thoughts. As a result, naturally, the topic of conversation focused on the memories the two shared.\u201cWhen we first met.\u201d\u201cOh, in the tutorial?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cWhat about then?\u201d\u201cWere you interested in me from back then?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeon-woo.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re acting like you were such a dashing figure that was the center of everyone\u2019s attention. Ugh.\u201d\u201cWait, that\u2019s not it\u2026\u201d\u201cHahaha. I\u2019m just joking.\u201dYeon-woo could not help but sigh lightly as he watched Edora, who seemed to be having a lot of fun at his expense. If this kept going, Yeon-woo felt that he would have to go through the same treatment that he dished out to Henova\u2026 Now that he was on the receiving end, Yeon-woo truly felt the constricting feeling around his neck. In an instant, Yeon-woo could picture how his life would be with Edora.\u201cI was a little curious about you back then.\u201d\u201cCurious?\u201d\u201cYeah. It was the first time I saw someone my age who could overwhelmingly beat me and my idiot brother, Phante. Moreover\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cThough you met me for the first time, you didn\u2019t seem agitated or wary at all.\u201d\u201c\u2026you know that you\u2019re\u2026\u201d\u201cActing like I\u2019m a little weird? Yeah, I know that I was and still am weird. But you must admit, I\u2019m also a steal.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Since Edora admitted it so outright, Yeon-woo was left speechless.\u201cIsn\u2019t it the case that my appearance and my pedigree is top notch? I have a pretty face, my skin is good, my hair is excellent, my father is the Martial King, and my mother is a Psychic Medium. Furthermore, I possess the status as a princess of a tribe\u2026 Plus, I\u2019m strong and possess a lot of money. What\u2019s there not to like?\u201d Everything she said was true. Edora kept speaking as she twirled her hair with her index finger. \u201cHowever, after seeing a mysterious person roll in, wearing a mask for god\u2019s sake, causing a ruckus, and then just coolly leaving\u2026 It does make one wonder about such a person.\u201dYeon-woo somehow remembered a phrase he often heard in Korean morning dramas back on Earth. \u2018You\u2019re the only one who has done this to me.\u2019 It was a clich\u00e9\u2026but it rang true for him at this moment.\u201cWell, in fact, the most important thing in our tribe is ability rather than looks. Anyway\u2026after our first encounter, I went and looked for you while dragging around Phante\u2026 That\u2019s when I found a lot of positives about you. You didn\u2019t forget about us either, right?\u201dIf Yeon-woo never encountered Phante and Edora during that time in the tutorial, would things have worked out as they did? Would Yeon-woo have had the resolve to escape from the swamp of the abyss/void? The first thought that came to his mind was \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019. No matter how he looked at it, their influence was undeniably strong. This was also why Yeon-woo could not let this chance slip by. Was it because of that thought? Yeon-woo tightened his embrace around Edora.***Tweet!\u00a0Through the curtains, the sun\u2019s rays came in. Edora slowly opened her eyes to the sound of birds chirping. When did she fall asleep? Looking at the bright sun\u2019s rays flowing in, it seemed that morning had already passed\u2026 Edora broke out into a smile.As she chatted happily all night with Yeon-woo, Edora did not realize how much time had passed. It was not just continuous idle chatter throughout the night. As they began talking and looking into each other\u2019s eyes, sparks would fly, causing them to rush into another passionate, crazy exchange. Thus, time flew by.As Edora recalled what happened last night, she blushed and scratched her cheek. Then, she realized that Yeon-woo was not beside her. Where did he go? Edora jumped out of her bed in surprise and looked around quickly. Then, belatedly, she found a note lying at her bedside.I\u2019ll be back. I\u2019m going to go out for a walk.It was only then that Edora was able to breathe a sigh of relief. She then broke out into another smile. Yeon-woo always left without a word, so she had momentarily been concerned that he had done the same thing this time as well. Though he had said he would not be leaving like that anymore, she was still concerned\u2026In hindsight, Yeon-woo had made Edora like this. If he did not leave all the time without saying a word, she would not be feeling so nervous all the time\u2026! Edora pouted. She couldn\u2019t help but pout at the predicament that she, a well-mannered, well brought-up, rich, and pretty maiden had to be in.\u2018Well, since he took the time to write a note this time around\u2026 I\u2019ll let him off this time.\u2019 Concerned that she might be worried, Yeon-woo had taken the time to write her a note. His crooked handwriting was ugly, but he was good-looking, so Edora decided that the two qualities canceled each other out.The whole time she touched the note, Edora smiled. Then, she suddenly had a thought. Was this a place where he could relaxedly walk around?***Outside the Tower, there were many merchant areas where blacksmiths and vendors gathered. Yeon-woo was currently in a crowded place, one as crowded as he recalled in the past. Not knowing that Allforone on the seventy-seventh floor had disappeared or that the gods and demons on the ninety-eighth floor had been imprisoned, the people\u2019s faces were full of enthusiasm and vitality as they were all seemingly starting their day as usual.Yeon-woo occasionally glanced at their faces, and eventually got on a familiar road. He eventually made his way to a certain blacksmith shop that had stopped at some point\u2026 He looked up at the shop\u2019s signboard for a moment. Was it because he remembered the first time he visited this place? Yeon-woo had trouble moving his rooted feet.\u201cWhat are you doing, standing with such a dumb look on your face?\u201dYeon-woo heard someone murmur from behind him. Wasn\u2019t he supposed to be inside? Yeon-woo hurriedly turned his head. Like Edora\u2019s, it was the voice Yeon-woo had longed to hear. As he looked back, Yeon-woo saw a frowning Henova carrying a bunch of materials in his arms.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a completely different feeling from when he met Edora again after turning back the \u2018wheel\u2019. This was a sense of longing and sorrow.\u201cHenova\u2026? Umm. How should I explain this\u2026\u201dBefore turning the \u2018wheel\u2019, Yeon-woo spoke with Phante, who was reluctant to talk about Henova. Rather than trying to hide something, Phante seemed more worried that Yeon-woo would feel hurt. It was weird that Phante, who was largely indifferent in most matters, showed such a reaction.\u201cTo be honest\u2026he missed you a lot. Umm, how should I explain this\u2026 He didn\u2019t seem to recall you, yet he seemed to be missing you.\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cAs much as Henova missed you, he seemed to have felt an emptiness. I often saw him reminiscing in front of the anvil he brought out from the Tower, throwing things in anger into his furnace for no apparent reason\u2026 You know, those kinds of things.\u201dHearing Phante\u2019s explanation, Yeon-woo remained quiet for a long time. Just like when Cha Jeong-woo disappeared, Henova seemed to have missed Yeon-woo\u2019s presence. And though Henova seemed to know of Yeon-woo\u2019s existence and identity, he did not show it outwardly. Did Henova sulk like when Cha Jeong-woo disappeared? It was a bit hard for Yeon-woo to imagine.\u201cHowever, I can tell you one thing for sure.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhen Henova closed his eyes for the last time, the name he called out was yours.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dYeon-woo had been thrown into a state of confusion after hearing those words. Kronos and Rhea later remembered his existence as well, but it took them a lot of time to fully remember his \u2018name\u2019. How was Henova able to recall his name so quickly? It seemed to mean that Henova had been very concerned about Yeon-woo.That day, Yeon-woo cried for a long time. Phante, unable to read the temperature of the room, started snickering at Yeon-woo when Yeon-woo started crying, which left Phante with a snowball-sized bruise on his face.However, after that day, Yeon-woo found himself immersed in thought while feeling various complicated emotions. And now\u2026Henova stood in front of him, possessing the same looks that Yeon-woo recalled in his memories. He recognized the constantly irritable face, an always angry tone, an ungroomed bushy beard, a filthy mustache\u2026 Everything was the same.However, this reminiscing feeling was short-lived. Yeon-woo did not want to reveal his inner emotions, so he responded nonchalantly. \u201cI was wondering where you were. It\u2019s hard to find you because of your short height.\u201d\u201cWhat, bastard?\u201d One of Henova\u2019s eyebrows nervously wriggled as he quickly glanced up and down at Yeon-woo.\u201cWhy are you giving me that look, Henova?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m wondering what broken thing you\u2019re bringing me this time around.\u201d\u201cDo I only come when something is broken?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cPerhaps I just came by to say hi? No?\u201dHenova snorted as his facial expression seemed to state that Yeon-woo\u2019s response was absurd. \u201cSure\u2026 This coming from someone who I never hear from unless something is wrong\u2026\u201d It was a constant outpour of grumbling and mumbling. As if Henova wanted to shed all the anger he had accumulated with Yeon-woo, he continued to pour out a bunch of nasty words.While listening to Henova\u2019s explanation of him, Yeon-woo could not help but flinch. He wondered if there was such an evil person in the world. \u2018\u2026Was I aloof to that extent?\u2019Surely, now that Yeon-woo thought about it, he must have came across as an evil person to Henova. No, it was not just Henova. Phante, Edora, the Martial King, and Yeon-woo\u2019s familiars\u2026 Maybe Khan and Doyle felt the same way as well. Yeon-woo always lived as if he was being chased by something, and because of that, he often did not take good care of the people around him. Yeon-woo felt that he could have momentarily stopped and looked around occasionally. After all, what was always so urgent at that time?\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d So, Yeon-woo bowed his head to Henova, who was still passionately blabbering on.For a moment, Henova stopped his grumbling and blinked his eyes. He wondered why Yeon-woo was acting unlike himself. \u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really sorry for upsetting you all this time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThough such an apology did not fully convey his feelings, Yeon-woo still hoped that Henova\u2019s anger would subside, even just a little\u2026\u201cHey, who are you?\u201dApparently, the words were not able to convey Yeon-woo\u2019s feelings.\u201cThe Cain I know would never say such sappy things. Are you a doppelganger or something? Where did that shitty temper go? Are you trying to trick me?\u201d Henova dropped whatever he held in his arms onto the floor, pulled out a halberd that was much bigger than his body, and aimed it at Yeon-woo. It seemed Henova was ready to launch a full-on assault at any moment. The killing intent he exuded was no joke.\u201c\u2026\u201d Yeon-woo blinked his eyes in surprise for a long time, not knowing how to explain the situation.***\u201cReally, it\u2019s you?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes, really.\u201d\u201c\u2026that can\u2019t be. You\u2019re too weird.\u201d\u201c\u2026What can I do to gain your trust?\u201dThe task of convincing Henova took a much longer time than Yeon-woo expected. No matter how many times Yeon-woo asserted that he was in fact himself, and provided supporting evidence, Henova\u2019s eyes only filled with greater doubt.\u2018That bastard can never be this polite,\u2019 or \u2018It\u2019s as believable as a bald person growing hair overnight?\u2019 or \u2018One\u2019s temper and personality can\u2019t be improved overnight\u2019... It was only after a lot of evaluation, using harsh and somewhat abusive words, that Henova\u2019s suspicions seemed to somewhat subside. However, what followed was an entirely different suspicion.\u201cAre you sick?\u201d\u201c\u2026Do I look like a sick person to you?\u201d\u201cI guess, if it really is you, you\u2019re stubborn enough to be sent to the underworld and proclaim to the devil that you\u2019re not supposed to be there.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Though Yeon-woo wanted to state that he possessed the divine position of death\u2026he decided to remain quiet.\u201cWell, actually, if one thinks about it, there\u2019s no one in this Tower who has been scorned and cursed as much as you\u2026 If one were to listen to all of it, one could possibly live an eternal life.\u201dHearing this, Yeon-woo had all kinds of thoughts. Should he fight back? He had been quiet because of the regret he felt towards Henova, but as Henova continued to scratch his sore spots, Yeon-woo\u2019s original personality kept trying to rear its head.However, just when Yeon-woo was just having these thoughts, Henova stopped pouring out curses towards Yeon-woo. Henova crossed his arms and had a sullen expression on his face. \u201cThen why did you really come here?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? I just came to see you.\u201d\u201cSo? Do you really have no other business?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 There is something small.\u201d\u201cHmpf! I knew it!\u201d Henova could read Yeon-woo inside and out. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cCan I borrow your anvil and hammer?\u201d\u201cMy anvil and hammer? Are you going to make something?\u201d Henova tilted his head, wondering what kind of grand artifact Yeon-woo wanted to forge. The Yeon-woo he knew has already received the title of \u2018master crafter\u2019. In terms of crafting skills, Yeon-woo was not far behind Henova. In other words, Yeon-woo could easily create something no matter where he was and whatever tools he used. There was no specific need to come to Henova\u2019s place.And yet, Yeon-woo had come to Henova\u2019s workshop. Was Yeon-woo planning on making something tremendous? Henova\u2019s back shot up as he thought that Yeon-woo was planning to make something as grand as the Philosopher\u2019s Stone. He recalled how grueling and difficult it was at that time, so he was concerned that Yeon-woo would drag him into another grueling project.\u2018\u2026Hmm?\u2019Yeon-woo\u2019s nose turned slightly red. Yeon-woo was also respectfully bowing his head\u2026 This was something Henova saw for the first time in his life. Henova\u2019s expression seemed to state, \u2018He must have eaten something wrong\u2019. However, the surprises did not end there.\u201cI want to make a ring.\u201d\u201cA ring? You\u2026 Perhaps?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cAn engagement ring\u2026 Huh? What?\u201d Yeon-woo blinked his eyes in surprise and stopped speaking about his engagement ring when he processed Henova\u2019s outburst.However, Henova had a serious expression on his face. \u201cEdora, such a kind and pretty child\u2026 How can I approve of such a person being married to a bastard like you? Never! Even when the dirt hits my eyes when I\u2019m dead and being buried\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d For the first time in his life, Yeon-woo felt a sense of hate towards Henova.***Whoosh! Bang! Bang!\u00a0Yeon-woo pounded the hammer in front of a blazing furnace. A small ring was taking shape. Compared to the other rings Yeon-woo possessed, this ring did not seem to possess any special features at all.Yeon-woo continued to pound down with the hammer.\u00a0Whoosh! Bang!\u00a0Henova looked at Yeon-woo\u2019s back from a distance. As the fire was stoked, smoke spread thickly throughout the workshop.\u2018What kind of nonsense got into him?\u2019 Thinking about marriage, Henova muttered to himself. It was a word that did not seem to fit his image. Unsurprisingly, it was because to Henova, marriage felt like another world.The people who flowed into the Tower were usually those who possessed bitterness in their hearts or had strong ideals. As a result, it was very rare for a player to meet a partner and start a family. Starting a family would usually be looked upon as putting a chain around one\u2019s personal goals. This was what Henova thought.Henova himself had never even thought of getting married. The main reason was that the number of female dwarves that he could be matched with in the Tower was extremely few, and like other players, he was concerned that a partner would only get in his way. Or, perhaps, Henova thought of marriage the way he did because of his experience of being married once before.He never confided in others, but before Henova entered the Tower, he had a family. Although he had no children, he had a loving wife, someone he loved immensely. But what was married life? Married life was a completely different concept from the love he had for his wife. If one was not able to be responsible for oneself, how was one supposed to responsibly care for two? Henova, during his youth, was unaware of this fact, so he had married his wife without thinking much of this sense of responsibility and ended up breaking up with his wife.And now, to see and hear such an immature guy suddenly stating that he was planning to get married, Henova felt the wind was blowing from the wrong direction. Maybe it was because Yeon-woo had a strong desire to have children after going through a death crisis, stirring up his paternal feelings\u2026or it could be that Yeon-woo was so exhausted that he suddenly wanted to settle down somewhere. Or maybe he had some strong emotional connection with Edora\u2026Whatever the reason, it was clear to Henova that some motive had greatly changed Yeon-woo\u2019s mind.\u2018Perhaps something in the future\u2026has something to do with it?\u2019Even though Henova did not express it, he had already guessed that the Yeon-woo in front of him was very different from the Yeon-woo he knew. Others would say that Yeon-woo was deceitful and deceiving, but even though Yeon-woo could deceive the eyes of others, he could not trick Henova\u2019s eyes.Power, the strength in his eyes, posture, skill, way of speaking\u2026 Everything was now different from the previous Yeon-woo. The Yeon-woo in front of Henova now exuded a depth that seemed to have been accumulated over decades or even a few hundred years.\u2018I don\u2019t know how you came back, but the fact that you came means that you\u2019ve probably achieved everything you wanted.\u2019 Henova had no idea what Yeon-woo obtained at the end of his journey. He was unable to look that far, unlike Edora with her discerning eyes, but that did not matter. Henova was truly proud of Yeon-woo\u2019s pursuit and effort to find happiness.\u2018Let\u2019s see\u2026 If those two get married, what should I get them?\u2019 Since he was largely known as one of the four master craftsmen, and since he was largely considered as the best among them, Henova had to put a lot of thought on what gift he should give the couple. He wanted to get something that would surprise even Yeon-woo, Edora, and the Martial King.In a moment\u2026\u2018Oh! I know exactly what to gift them.\u2019 Henova immediately thought of a good idea and smiled happily. Then, the smile slowly turned into a mischievous one. It was because he would finally be able to see an embarrassed expression on that shameless Yeon-woo\u2019s face. \u201cUh-huh!\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dWhen Henova let out a gloomy laugh, Yeon-woo stopped hammering momentarily and looked back.Looking at Henova\u2019s gaze, Yeon-woo sensed something ominous.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was complicated. Allforone was the reason why his family had been scattered, and Allforone was the enemy who blocked him several times. Yeon-woo still resented him, but he also pitied him.Yeon-woo had glimpsed into\u00a0Allforone\u2019s\u00a0past memories after absorbing him through Hades\u2019 Spirit Eating Sword. He knew what kind of life Allforone had lived, what ideals he had fought for, and how much he had been hurt in that process. His lover had also been one of the causes of his pain.\u2018A monster swallowed by his ideals.\u2019 Yeon-woo thought Allforone was a monster swallowed by himself\u2014a man who had gone far beyond the point of return. The problem was that Allforone also knew he had become a monster.Allforone and Yeon-woo were like twins in how they were so similar, but they were also exact opposites. They were the same in that they readily sacrificed themselves for their goals. However, while Yeon-woo continued to give his everything for his family despite facing endless despair, Allforone had a happy childhood but felt something was missing and sacrificed himself for his own definition of justice.Yeon-woo started out with nothing, whereas Allforone started out having everything. Yeon-woo wished to walk the path of darkness and be forgotten, while Allforne wished to become a bright light and fade away within it. At the same time, the two desperately desired to be acknowledged by their fathers, and they had struggled as a result of it.It was impossible to measure which life was more honorable and worthy. However, one thing was clear. What they each wanted was different, but Yeon-woo succeeded in getting what he wanted while Allforone didn\u2019t.Many thoughts flashed in Yeon-woo\u2019s mind at that moment. What should he do about that pitiful being in front of him? The poor ascetic who didn\u2019t live a life for himself could be destroyed with just a touch of Yeon-woo\u2019s fingertips.\u300eThe energy I feel is definitely Cha Yeon-woo\u2019s\u2026but you intensely give off the aura of the Black King. I see\u2026 You are\u2026 Yes. You\u2019ve succeeded in obtaining what you want.\u300fAllforone\u2019s\u00a0quavering voice suddenly turned low. He seemed to have realized something. He knew the secrets of this world\u2019s \u2018Day\u2019 and \u2018Night.\u2019 He most likely also knew of the long conflict between the Heavenly Demon and the Black King. Allforone seemed to have a grasp on what happened.\u300eThe fact that this dream wasn\u2019t awakened even after you took darkness\u2026must mean you became darkness itself. I did think it was strange player Cha Yeon-woo disappeared a while ago.\u300fDuring this time, Allforone had been carefully observing Yeon-woo\u2019s every movement. He had watched Yeon-woo escape Thanatos and attempt to exuviate in the Changgong Library. Since then, Yeon-woo had been marked by Allforone as a problematic player.But Yeon-woo had suddenly disappeared and was now right in front of Allforone. His appearance was the same, but he was of a level that made him seem like an entirely different person. It was a level that Allforone couldn\u2019t dare to grasp the strength of, even though he was the strongest in the Tower. When he realized Yeon-woo had a strength that was equal to the Heavenly Demon, he knew that Yeon-woo had already reached the emperor level.\u300eIn the end\u2026 I failed?\u300fKnowing that could only mean one thing, bitterness and remorse filled\u00a0Allforone\u2019s\u00a0voice.\u300eSo Father didn\u2019t watch over me even in the end. How very like him.\u300fHow would someone react when they learned of their future? And if that future wasn\u2019t a good one? No matter how firm their beliefs were, they\u2019d likely feel defeated and give up.An Allforone who gave up\u2026seemed bizarre. The Allforone who Yeon-woo knew all this time wasn\u2019t someone to ever do such a thing. However,\u00a0Allforone\u2019s\u00a0ideals would probably be broken more easily due to the reason that they were so steadfast. Then, who knew what he would become then?Chk!\u201c\u2026Hm?\u201dBut contrary to Yeon-woo\u2019s concerns, Allforone just clapped his hands together in front of him with a face that was no different from normal.\u300eThat does not mean anything.\u300fEach letter and word Allforone spoke was powerful. There was still some remorse, but there was a power that surpassed the remorse.\u300eI wouldn\u2019t have started if I was going to give up here.\u300fThe light around Allforone shone brighter than ever. This wasn\u2019t the faith sent by the people in the Tower. It was a power that originated from his own beliefs. This belief was turning into a great faith to radiate.\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d Yeon-woo smiled lightly. It appeared he was wrong. Allforone was Allforone, Vivasvat. Like the name of the sun god, Allforone shone brightly even in front of a future full of despair. Yes. This was one worthy of being called Yeon-woo\u2019s\u2026rival.\u201cHowever.\u201d A smirk formed on Yeon-woo\u2019s lips. \u201cYou aren\u2019t strong enough.\u201d Just because Yeon-woo understood Allforone didn\u2019t mean the resentment toward him was gone. Moreover, Yeon-woo had come to this timeline as a trip. He didn\u2019t want to become involved in bothersome matters.[The system is activated with the authority of a High Guardian!][Please give the command.]Clunk.\u00a0The sound of machinery that was invisible from this world rang out.\u201cTarget \u2018Vivasvat.\u2019\u201d\u300eWhat\u2026!\u300fAllforone quickly tried to step back but emptiness opened in front of him before he could. Chains soared out toward him.Clatter. Clang, clang!\u00a0Great Handprint was activated in the air. Each attack was powerful enough to easily destroy a stage, but the chains easily evaded the Great Handprint to reach Allforone. Yeon-woo\u2019s will and the system\u2019s direct management allowed the chains to be extremely durable. They were the laws of causality itself.\u00a0Whoosh! Whoosh!\u00a0Allforone struggled to escape from the chains.<Thousand Li Eyes><Shukuchi><Great Handprint>Allforone focused the eyes that observed the Tower onto the chains to predict their path and moved to where the chains wouldn\u2019t reach him. When there was a spot he missed, he exploded light to change the chain\u2019s direction. However, despite all his fancy tricks, the chains continue to close their distance.\u00a0Clatter!\u00a0Then, one of them succeeded in wrapping around his right ankle. And that was it.\u201cSeal.\u201d When Yeon-woo spoke a new command, another chain dashed forward and tightened around\u00a0Allforone\u2019s\u00a0limbs. Due to this, Allforone wasn\u2019t able to activate the Great Handprint for his powers anymore. The moment the seal took place, the light around him was extinguished like a candle in front of the wind.And the subsequently exposed face\u2026was very similar to the Heavenly Demon. However, while the Heavenly Demon looked mischievous and friendly, Allforone had an indifferent and firm gaze.\u201cLet go of\u2026!\u201d Allforone was cut off mid-sentence by the chains.Clatter!\u00a0Allforone was powerlessly absorbed into the emptiness. Yeon-woo could feel him thrashing about, but even Allforone couldn\u2019t resist the chains of laws of causality.\u2018What should I do about him?\u2019 Yeon-woo contemplated what to do about Allforone, to seal him off or kill him like before. Their relationship was like a problem that could never be solved. Even now, Yeon-woo felt the urge to pay him back. However, he contained his anger and quietly closed the door to emptiness. \u2018I\u2019ll just take him to the Heavenly Demon later.\u2019It would be simplest to let the Heavenly Demon take care of it. Of course, the Heavenly Demon would probably be taken aback.\u2018That\u2019ll be a sight to see.\u2019 Yeon-woo smiled, imagining the Heavenly Demon feeling conflicted over Allforone. Then, he thought, \u2018Of course, I can\u2019t let these creatures act up either.\u2019[The gods of the ninety-eighth floor shout at the sudden occurrence!][The demons of the ninety-eighth floor consider this their only chance to finally descend to the lower floors!]Yeon-woo could see the gods and demons Allforone had been blocking from the seventy-seventh floor\u00a0start\u00a0to get louder. It was quite like the heavenly world to become excited rather than wary of seeing Allforone being defeated so easily.\u201cClose.\u201d[The ninety-eighth floor is closed off from the other floors!]Clunk!\u00a0The Tower rumbled once again.[The gods of the ninety-eighth floor are shocked at the fact they cannot move out of their stage anymore!][The demons of the ninety-eighth floor look at you in fear!]It must\u2019ve come as a shock to the heavenly world to see Yeon-woo control the Tower with just a single command. To them, it was the appearance of someone worse than the Heavenly Demon.Yeon-woo could feel all the gazes of the ninety-eighth floor focused on him. He grinned at them, making them boil with frustration.* * *\u201cHehehe. I feel better after letting loose for the first time in a while.\u201d Phante returned, swinging his arms. He had a refreshed expression on his face.\u201cThat was fast.\u201d\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t anything difficult.\u201d Phante tossed the sword in his hand in the air and caught it. It was Gungnir. Phante had succeeded in eliminating Faceless. However, he acted as if it had only been a light jog in the park. Considering that Faceless was the Martial King\u2019s first disciple\u2026Phante had really become stronger during that time.\u2018But he\u2019s still Phante.\u2019 Yeon-woo brightened, thinking of how Phante\u2019s expression would be crumpled soon.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s with that face? Your expression is making me uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cSo where\u2019s the arm?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026?\u201d Phante\u2019s expression slowly froze. Yeon-woo\u2019s words from before he left to take care of Faceless flashed in his head.Leave an arm for me. You\u2019re gonna have him to yourself?Yeon-woo didn\u2019t miss the flustered face Phante quickly smoothened out and narrowed his eyes. The excitement on Phante\u2019s face faded away. Yeon-woo said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t leave anything behind?\u201d\u201c\u2026So you weren\u2019t joking?\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dSwish!\u00a0The air surrounding Yeon-woo changed.Flinch!\u00a0Phante paused and tried to retreat, but it wasn\u2019t an easy feat.\u201cI guess my words aren\u2019t that important anymore, hm?\u201d\u201cUgh, fuck! I didn\u2019t know you were being serious\u2026!\u201d\u201cFuck?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re swearing at me now? Now that I think about it, it\u2019s been a while since we established our hierarchy. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026! That isn\u2019t it!\u201d Phante expressed how wronged he felt while summoning his magic power. A small part of him was curious about how much stronger Yeon-woo was, and he wanted to test him out of curiosity.\u201cIgnorance.\u201dFwoosh!\u00a0Yeon-woo was in front of Phante before he could take up a defensive stance.\u201cNeeds to be beaten out.\u201d\u201cW-Wait\u2026!\u201d Phante shouted desperately, but Yeon-woo\u2019s fist was already speeding toward his eye.Pow!inyourgalaxy's ThoughtsI'm really sorry for the late chapter everyone!

At the same time, he was pleased that a guest had come to visit him for the first time in ages because he was feeling very bored. On top of that, he knew who this visitor was. There was only one person he knew in this entire world who sang foul songs like that. \u201cWhat are you singing this time?\u201dShanon paused his singing to answer the obvious question.\u300eThe second verse.\u300f\u201cSecond verse? That song has more lyrics?\u201d\u300eI made them recently. It\u2019s no fun to sing the first verse over and over again.\u300f\u201cWon\u2019t Hyung be angry if he knows?\u201d\u300eIt\u2019d be tough living, having to walk on eggshells around a man who\u2019s gone away on a trip leaving all his annoying subordinates behind.\u300f\u201cYou\u2019re probably the only person who can talk to Hyung that way.\u201d Cha Jeong-woo shook his head. He supposed this was Shanon\u2019s charm. It was ironic that such a mischievous and amiable guy was the Black King\u2019s first sword and had the domain of domination. He was grateful Shanon was the same as ever despite his upgraded position and all the time that had passed\u2026 Of course, he was more pleased that he had a comrade to tease his brother with. That was most likely the reason why the two had become such good friends.\u300eWhat are you saying? There were a lot.\u300f\u201cHuh? Really?\u201d\u300eEmphasis on\u00a0were.\u300f\u201c\u2026Past-tense?\u201d\u300eI\u2019m saying there are a lot of people who have gone missing after stabbing my owner in the back.\u300fShanon wasn\u2019t wrong, so Cha Jeong-woo couldn\u2019t help but laugh loudly. Then, it suddenly occurred to him that he shouldn\u2019t be laughing like this. No matter how far away Yeon-woo was, Yeon-woo could be observing them if he wanted to. \u2018So annoying. I have to be wary of my brother whenever I\u2019m trying to do something.\u2019While Cha Jeong-woo thought to himself, Shanon looked around the holy territory and stopped when he saw a particular person.\u300eHm\u2026? That\u2019s an unfamiliar face.\u300f\u201cAh! Is that so?\u201dShanon\u2019s gaze was on a beautiful boy who had white hair that reached his waist. He looked to be in his teens, but his dark eyes made him seem like an aged man. It was impossible to tell his age. The boy wearing a large-fitting training dobok was staring so intently at a sword planted in the ground that it almost felt rude to walk up and disrupt him.Shanon recognized the sword the boy was glaring at. It was Dragon Slayer, Cha Jeong-woo\u2019s divine artifact, but he had no idea who that boy was to be glowering at the Dragon Slayer like that.\u201cMy disciple.\u201d\u300eOho! So then he\u2019s the one\u2026?\u300fCha Jeong-woo nodded, and Shanon exclaimed in astonishment. Jeong-woo had told him about taking a disciple in passing, back in the past when the entire world had forgotten about the Black King. He had said there was a child he coincidentally came to meet while roaming the many world lines to search for Yeon-woo.If Shanon remembered correctly, Jeong-woo had said he met his disciple when meeting a remnant of a beast. Jeong-woo had been pitiful of the boy who had outstanding potential and a brilliant nature but was waiting for his fated death, and Jeong-woo ultimately took him in.But Shanon hadn\u2019t expected the boy to be here. He was already interested in the boy. As he stroked his chin, he asked a question.\u300eDidn\u2019t you say he\u2019s human?\u300f\u201cHe grew up quite a bit in the time that I hadn\u2019t seen him. He\u2019s almost ascended to being an immortal, so I\u2019m thinking of leaving him the Jinmu Cabinet.\u201d\u300eIs that so?\u300fCha Jeong-woo created many legends while he wandered the countless world lines. Because of this, he had various divine titles other than \u2018Deus Ex Machina.\u2019 One of those was Jinmu Emperor, also known as True Martial Emperor. Jinmu Cabinet was an organization named after this title.Jeong-woo had succeeded the Heavenly Demon\u2019s Changgong Library librarian position. There were so many duties to organize the shelves that he had created the Jinmu Cabinet to work for him.The Jinmu Cabinet belonged to neither absolute good nor absolute evil. They played the role of keeping the balance, so they had to be martially and militarily powerful.Jeong-woo said he\u2019d leave the cabinet leader position to Jeong-hyun. He didn\u2019t choose him merely because he was his disciple, but he thought Jeong-hyun truly had the abilities that fit the position. Jeong-hyun was strong enough to stand above most lower-level gods, and he would most likely become the center of power in the heavenly world. The cabinet leader had to have a firm deposition to deny all requests and bribes.\u2018This\u2019ll be amusing.\u2019 Shanon\u2019s gaze on Jeong-hyun turned from curiosity to wanting to fight. After becoming completely \u201cindependent\u201d from Yeon-woo, he became the Black King\u2019s first sword, but many people avoided him because of this reason. Shanon was excited at the thought of finally having someone to spar. He wondered what the boy\u2019s name was\u2026\u300eJeong\u2026hyun\u300fSwish!\u00a0The white-haired boy who had been glaring at the Dragon Slayer turned to Shanon. He looked as if he was asking who dared to say his name.\u201c\u2026Haa. So much for reading.\u201d Jeong-woo felt the tension and lightly tossed his book aside. Then, he took a few steps back. Shanon wasn\u2019t someone who could be dissuaded, and his disciple wasn\u2019t someone who avoided anyone who picked a fight.Shanon waved his finger at Jeong-hyun to come closer, and Jeong-hyun raised his eyebrows.\u00a0Whoosh!\u00a0Jeong-hyun suddenly disappeared with the Dragon Slayer planted in the ground. Then, suddenly, a sharp blade was at Shanon\u2019s neck.\u300eNice spirit!\u300fClang!\u00a0Shanon pushed the Dragon Slayer back with his Sword Breaker and shouted. He could already tell this was going to be a fun fight from the way his blade was shaking.Clang! Clang clang! Rumble, rumble!\u00a0The holy territory Jeong-woo created as a getaway instantly became turned over with explosions.* * *\u300eHegh\u2026 Hegh\u2026!\u300f\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026!\u201dShanon and Jeong-hyun lay on the ground wearily, panting roughly.\u300eYou\u2019re\u2026pretty good\u2026!\u300f\u201cAnd\u2026you\u2026!\u201dShanon knew the battle would be over instantly if he used his domains too, so he fought Jeong-hyun with just the sword. And what he felt as a result of his fight was that Jeong-woo had every right to be proud.Even Shanon, who had sharpened his sword-wielding skills for hundreds of years in the lower year, thought Jeong-hyun was quite the opponent. The outcome of the sparring was a tie. Yeon-woo would\u2019ve been surprised to hear of this result. However, Jeong-hyun seemed dissatisfied with himself by this, and he responded curtly.Smirk!\u00a0Shanon was amused by Jeong-hyun\u2019s reaction. He wanted to fight him again.\u201cYou done now?\u201d Jeong-woo looked down at them from where he was sitting on a tree, the only intact thing in the holy territory.\u300eOf course not. We don\u2019t even have a victor yet. Isn\u2019t that right?\u300f\u201cOf course.\u201d Jeong-hyun responded as if that was obvious.Jeong-woo made a fatigued expression. \u201cThis is enough, causing a mess in someone else\u2019s house for today. Anyway, what\u2019s the real reason you\u2019re here? Didn\u2019t you have something to ask?\u201d\u300e\u2026Hm? Oh! Right.\u300fShanon belatedly remembered why he came visiting and scratched the back of his head. He\u2019d forgotten it while sparring with Jeong-hyun.\u201cSo there really is something?\u201dShanon nodded.\u300eYeah. I was wondering if there\u2019s anything you\u2019ve heard from our Emperor Temper.\u300f\u201cMy brother? What about him?\u201d\u300eI suddenly can\u2019t reach him. To be exact, my Channel to him has been dysfunctional for several months now.\u300f\u201cIsn\u2019t that because he rewound the wheel?\u201dShanon shook his head.\u300eNo. Even if he\u2019s in another timeline or world line, our Channel to him is always connected. We communicate through it if there\u2019s ever need.\u300fCha Jeong-woo nodded, knowing that Shanon was right.The same gods with the same name and ability had their own personalities and identities in parallel universes or other universes. It was because only their soul was the same, and their lives were all unique.However, emperors like the Heavenly Demon, Black King, and Jeong-woo were different. Emperors were the only one of their kind throughout all the universes and worlds, with their distinct identity and body.That was why although Yeon-woo rewound the wheel and went to another world line, it was only his ego that was there. His body existed the same in all other world lines and timelines. That meant his connection with his subordinates could never be disconnected. But\u2026Shanon\u2019s connection with Yeon-woo being gone was strange.\u300eSo I was wondering if you\u2019re contacting master separately.\u300f\u201cNo. I figured he\u2019s doing fine on his own. It\u2019d be weird to take interest in every little thing he\u2019s doing too.\u201dEven the closest of brothers didn\u2019t share every little detail, and Jeong-woo and Yeon-woo tried to respect each other\u2019s privacy.Thinking something was really strange, Jeong-woo opened his palm. A circle made of light grew and grew until it became a book.[You are browsing for information in the library with your qualification as first-class librarian!][Keyword: Darkness, Cha Yeon-woo, Location]Flutter!\u00a0The pages quickly turned over. This browsing feature was one the librarian of the Changgong Library had. However, because of the vast amount of information, it took some time.Jeong-hyun felt the tense atmosphere and took a step back from the two.Looking at the book with half its pages turned, Jeong-woo asked, \u201cWhat about Hanryeong or Rebecca? Nothing?\u201d\u300eHanryeong has been unreachable for a while because he\u2019s traveling with his son\u2026and Rebecca has returned to Cernunnos, and she\u2019s started going into intense training, so there\u2019s no way to contact her.\u300fShanon had come here thinking the situation wasn\u2019t too serious and that Jeong-woo would definitely know of Yeon-woo\u2019s whereabouts. However, his voice turned grave when he realized that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201cAnd Boo?\u201d\u300eHe was the one who asked about master.\u300f\u201cWhat?\u201d Jeong-woo wrinkled his forehead.Just then, the last page turned over and the cover was shut.[The Black King is currently asleep on Earth with R'lyeh.][No other information can be found.]Jeong-woo quickly added other keywords.[The keywords \u2018Main Ego,\u2019 \u2018Location,\u2019 and \u2018Whereabouts\u2019 have been added to the search.]\u2026[Cannot be found.][The keywords \u2018Wheel,\u2019 \u2018Phante,\u2019 and \u2018Edora\u2019 have been added to the search.]\u2026[Cannot be found.]\u2026[Cannot be found.]\u2026[No information has been yielded.][You require higher clearance to search for more information.]Snap!\u00a0Jeong-woo closed the book of light. His face was now stiff. It occurred to him that a greater danger from when the entire world forgot about Yeon-woo had come about.\u201cLet\u2019s go see Mr. Heavenly Demon first.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Heavenly Demon had fought against the Black King for eons over the wheel, but that had occurred when the Black King\u2019s main ego was Yvlke. It didn\u2019t apply to the present, with Yeon-woo having taken over that spot, absorbing all the egos to become the complete Black King.The Heavenly Demon wondered if someone or something was hurting the current Black King. \u2018Impossible.\u2019 Incidents took place when the strings of laws of causality through space became twisted. But since the Black King himself was the laws of causality, there was no way something could surpass him.\u2018Or is there someone else?\u2019The otherworld gods who followed the Black King, for example. Although most of them acknowledged Yeon-woo was their father, there were some who weren't completely bound to him, like the Resident of the Border. However, considering how loyal the Resident of the Border was to the Black King, it was impossible for him to be the cause of this situation.\u2018If not that\u2026\u2019 The Heavenly Demon narrowed his eyes. \u2018It might be a beast that\u2019s still roaming outside the wheel.\u2019Still, that left some questions unanswered. Beasts were also ultimately unable to transcend the limits of the wheel. They were beings who failed to become emperors and were eventually flung out. How could such creatures touch the Black King? None of the Heavenly Demon\u2019s guesses seemed plausible.\u201cI also tried to come up with ideas, but nothing came to mind.\u201d Cha Jeong-woo scratched the back of his head as if he understood what the Heavenly Demon was thinking.The Heavenly Demon nodded. He had chosen Jeong-woo to be the Changgong Library\u2019s librarian and the balance of the wheel. There was no way he wouldn\u2019t be able to think of something Jeong-woo did.\u201cLet\u2019s search a bit first.\u201d The Heavenly Demon looked up.[The Changgong Library reacts to the authority and clearance of the special-class librarian.]The library was already a part of the Heavenly Demon. All of its knowledge was in his palm.\u201cBring me everything related to the keyword \u2018Cha Yeon-woo.\u2019\u201d[Deriving search results.]Chwa chwa chwa!\u00a0Light flashed all around them and countless books floated in the air. They spun in the air toward the Heavenly Demon. At a single glance, there seemed to be about a thousand of them.There was a lot of time between when Yeon-woo was born to when he became the Black King. On top of that, when taking into consideration the amount of data on the Black King, the books being summoned were nothing.The Heavenly Demon removed a majority of the books with specific filters, and about a hundred books were left. \u201cIn chronological order.\u201d The books mixed and spun, then stood in a single line in front of the Heavenly Demon.Jeong-woo and Nocturne looked on with interest. Because of how high the levels of their souls were, it was amazing to them how freely the Heavenly Demon was able to control the records of the Changgong Library.Only Shanon, who didn\u2019t understand how incredible it was, was indifferent.\u300eThere was something Master said about you, Heavenly Demon. I now see why he said that.\u300fThe Heavenly Demon stopped extending his hand toward the first book and turned back at Shanon with curiosity. Finding Yeon-woo was important, but he was interested in what Yeon-woo had said about him. Nocturne and Cha Jeong-woo also looked at Shanon with curiosity, wondering what did one of the most powerful beings say about another powerful existence. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\u300eThat you like showing off.\u300f\u201c\u2026What?\u201dIt was like time stopped.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNocturne and Jeong-woo were at a loss for words. It seemed best just to stay quiet. At the same time, the Heavenly Demon furrowed his eyebrows.\u300eAnd he said you\u2019re an attention seeker. I can see why he said that.\u300fShanon crossed his arms and nodded in understanding. He felt it was unnecessary to pull out a bunch of books and make them stand in a line.\u201cHa. Hahaha. He really said that?\u201d The Heavenly Demon chuckled like a third-rate villain and glowered. \u201cI\u2019ll show you how an attention-seeker does things to garner more attention!\u201dFlutter!\u00a0The Heavenly Demon roughly turned the pages, and the pages moved with vigor. The Heavenly Demon\u2019s eyes were blazing.Jeong-woo watched the Heavenly Demon flabbergasted and spoke to Shanon in his mind.\u300e\u2026Hyung really said that?\u300f\u300eOf course not. I just said that because I felt like the Heavenly Demon work harder to find Master if I said that.\u300f\u300eHa, hahaha. Of course.\u300fJeong-woo was inwardly in awe of Shanon. Finding Yeon-woo\u00a0was\u00a0important, but he was still surprised how Shanon mustered the courage to touch the Heavenly Demon\u2019s pride. Jeong-woo could never. Shanon really had guts.Just then, Shanon spoke up with a laugh.\u300eBut I didn\u2019t make things up.\u300f\u300e\u2026What did he say exactly?\u300f\u300eHe said the Heavenly Demon likes attention so much that he acts deranged and frenzied if he receive any.\u300f\u300e\u2026\u300f\u300eI figured I shouldn\u2019t say that much.\u300f\u300e\u2026Good job.\u300fJeong-woo nodded at Shanon\u2019s response. He felt it\u2019d be best to keep this to himself to the grave.Just then, one of the flapping pages suddenly stopped rigidly.\u201cThis is\u2026?\u201d Jeong-woo ran over urgently.\u201cYou said you couldn\u2019t find any information, right? So I\u2019m going to go over time in order from when your brother rewound the wheel. This page has that recorded.\u201dJeong-woo swallowed. Information related to the Heavenly Demon and the Black King were related to the secrets of the creation of the universe, so he couldn\u2019t see it even though he was a first-class librarian. His heart beat faster at the fact that he was able to see this right now, but at the same time, he felt a thrill because it was as if he was reading his brother\u2019s hidden diary.Flutter.\u00a0The Heavenly Demon began to flip the pages.* * *[The \u2018Large Wheel\u2019 is rewound.]Chrrrk.\u00a0Like the rewind button on a VCR had been pressed, the world began to flow backwards. Only Yeon-woo and Phante remained normal.\u201cHehe. I\u2019m already itching for a fight. I can\u2019t endure it any longer\u2026\u201d Although there was an almost impossible miracle occurring in front of him, Phante didn\u2019t seem to care. He was busy warming himself up in preparation for his reunion with his father.Pfft.\u00a0Yeon-woo couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Quite a long time had passed and many things had changed, but in some ways, he found that Phante\u2019s innocence was the same.[The rate of change of darkness is in progress. 58%\u2026]\u2018It doesn\u2019t seem to be affecting my transcendence.\u2019 Yeon-woo narrowed his eyes. \u2018Rather, it\u2019s sped it up.\u2019It had been 57% just a few moments ago, and while the wheel was being rewound, it increased by a percent. This was an incredible speed compared to how slow it had been changing recently.\u2018The closer I am to the world\u2019s activation\u2026 The closer I am to omniscience and omnipotence, the more it\u2019s affected\u2026 Is that it?\u2019While Yeon-woo made his conjectures, the Earth became stained with darkness.\u00a0Chwa chwa chwa.\u00a0Above the exposed otherworld, pieces of the toppled Tower were assembled. People who had been escaping the falling Tower were sucked back in, and R'lyeh who had tried to come out of Earth sank slowly back down into it.\u2018I\u2019m essentially building the Ruyi Bang to press down on my own stomach.\u2019No one had probably ever inflicted pain on themselves on a scale like this.Just then, Phante spoke up. \u201cBut what time period are we returning to?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll have to be when Seseungnim was intact\u2026so I\u2019m thinking about a few months before the incident happened.\u201d\u201cUgh! Can I go and punch in that damned bastard\u2019s face before going to the village?\u201d Phante was speaking about Faceless, the main culprit behind the people who endangered the Martial King. If Phante could eliminate Faceless and steal Gungnir, Asgard wouldn\u2019t interfere like before. Nocturne was also a problem, but they probably didn\u2019t have to worry about him. They could just return to a time before Faceless met and persuaded him.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhy!\u201d\u201cLeave an arm for me. You\u2019re gonna have him to yourself?\u201d\u201cHehehe. True. I wasn\u2019t thinking things through.\u201d Phante started laughing.[The rewinding is complete!]Slam!\u00a0Phante dashed forward without looking back. He didn\u2019t seem to care what floor they were on or what was around them. Yeon-woo inwardly clicked his tongue. It seemed there was another side of Phante that time wasn\u2019t able to change.[The visit of an unidentified player has been discerned![[His identity is being read.][He is extremely similar to the player \u2018Phante.\u2019 However, there is a great difference with the stored data and the decision is delayed.]\u2026[It has been confirmed that player \u2018Phante\u2019 is currently residing in the Tower\u2019s Outer District.][It has been ruled this player is another player.][Attempting to export trespassing player.]The system discovered Phante and activated its defense system. This was due to the fact that there was already a being called \u2018Phante\u2019 in this world line. However, this Phante and that Phante were clearly different. Their resolve and abilities were just the beginning.\u2018I can\u2019t believe that idiot was considered to be a chief who continued the golden age of the One-horned tribe after succeeding his father\u2019s position\u2026\u2019Phante would probably get mad if he knew Yeon-woo was concerned about the safety of the tribe as soon as he heard that. Yeon-woo tapped the air in front of him to ensure Phante wasn\u2019t kicked out.[You are connected to the system.]\u2026[Your identity as High Guardian has been confirmed.][Will you register a new player?]Yeon-woo successfully registered his Phante as a new player. He also gave him the ability to freely move between all floors except for the hundredth floor in case of future problems.[The Bureau searches for the cause of the sudden change.][The gods of the ninety-eighth floor sense your presence.][The demons of the ninety-eighth floor perceive your existence and become wary.]\u2018They finally caught on.\u2019 Yeon-woo wondered how he appeared to the beings of the heavenly world. Putting the thought aside, he began to search for the location of Faceless, when\u2026\u2018Yup.\u2019 Yeon-woo raised a corner of his mouth. \u2018He\u2019s here.\u2019[Allforone descends!]Krrrrrng!\u00a0White lightning fell in front of Yeon-woo and Allforone appeared. The light surrounding him shone more brilliantly than ever. Shock. Disbelief. Wariness\u2026 All kinds of emotions were whirling.\u300eSo much darkness.

I think he\u2019s asking if this is all a dream. No, how do you even know that, Shanon?\u201d Jeong-woo asked. He was surprised that someone who\u2019d never lived on Earth knew such trends.\u300eIs that what\u2019s important right now?! Say something! Is this really a dream? Did my damned master completely assimilate with the Black King and start to play the dream?\u300fThe currently developing universe was all the Black King\u2019s dream and technically, the Black King was always asleep. However, Yeon-woo was able to roam around freely because the dream\u2019s owner was identifying himself with an ego in his dream. That meant the Black King was traveling in this dream with the identity of Yeon-woo, and that dream was the original worldline.So technically, Shanon was right. However, that wasn\u2019t what he was asking. He was demanding to know if Yeon-woo had been fully synchronized with the Black King and turned back the dream to make all the events they were watching something that had never happened. Then, it made sense that the Heavenly Demon and Jeong-woo weren\u2019t able to observe them happening and that only Yeon-woo\u2019s records were the ones missing.Emperors were distinctly separate from the dreams of the Black King. Even if dreams were wound back to never have happened, they would never suffer the consequences. But\u2026\u201cI think\u2026so. Mm. How do I put this?\u201d Jeong-woo scratched the back of his head and smiled wryly. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bit different. Right?\u201dThe Heavenly Demon nodded.\u300eSo what\u2019s going on?! By the look on your faces, you obviously know something is going on!\u300fPft. Smirk.However, the Heavenly Demon and Jeong-woo just made mysterious smiles. Shanon scowled at the foreboding atmosphere\u2015although he didn\u2019t really have a face.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t be fun if we tell him already, would it?\u201d\u201cOf course. The wise men of the past once said you shouldn\u2019t give fish to hungry people, but teach them how to fish instead. So figure it out on your own! Heehee!\u201d\u300e\u2026!\u300fShanon looked back and forth between the two in disbelief, but they had no indication of telling him the answer easily. Still, they were talking bullshit about fishing or whatever, perhaps it actually wasn\u2019t that grave a situation.\u300e\u2026Damn it. How did I get involved with these people?\u300fShanon was flabbergasted, but he knew he would only be made fun of if he asked again. \u2018I guess I\u2019ll know if I finish this book.\u2019 As of this moment, there were only two things he could do. One was to finish reading this book until the end, and the second was to desperately hope everything really was fine.* * *The wedding ceremony of the One-horned tribe was further divided into more steps.First travel.This was the groom\u2019s first time going to see his bride, and this step described the procession of the groom\u2019s side traveling to the bride.Actually, the palace was a place Yeon-woo was well-acquainted with, but everything felt foreign today. It felt like he was walking this path as a different person.\u2018\u2026So that\u2019s what this means.\u2019 Yeon-woo finally realized the meaning of the word \u201cfirst.\u201d No matter how familiar this path was, it felt different because his mindset before marriage and after marriage wasn\u2019t going to be the same. Until now, they were lovers, but they were going to become a real couple now. His mindset and steps as he walked down the path were naturally different.First travel was the first step Yeon-woo\u2019d take toward becoming a couple. And when Yeon-woo finally arrived at the palace\u2026\u201cWoooooh!\u201d\u201cWhat a good-looking groom!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s super tall too!\u201d\u201cKya! I was wondering who would take our lofty princess\u2026but she really did have a pair! Well, even shoes come in pairs, I suppose. Of course.\u201d\u201cBut why don\u2019t you have one?\u201d\u201cAre you picking a fight with me? Do you want your teeth to be knocked out on a fine day like this?\u201d\u201cCan you even do it?\u201d\u2019\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat, you punk?\u201dThe noisy tribe members, guests, and onlookers are cheered at the top of their lungs. It was truly a festival.Congratulations\u2605Emperor Temper\u2019s Marriage!When will he return~ if he goes now?~ He\u2019ll come right away~ when he\u2019s ready to stab people in the back~\u266cOppa yesterday, honey tomorrow\u2665Banners with strange messages flapped in the wind above the guests\u2019 heads, but Yeon-woo pretended not to see them. Nothing good would come out of paying attention to them. No, to be exact, he didn\u2019t even have the mind to pay attention.Gulp!\u00a0Yeon-woo swallowed in front of the door to the palace. The nervousness he\u2019d managed to ease was starting to come back up again.After taking in a few deep breaths, Yeon-woo opened the door with a newfound resolve.\u00a0Creak.\u00a0The large door was opened wide, and there was a red silk carpet down the center, with guests filling the seats on the carpet\u2019s left and right. At the front, the parents of both families were proudly looking down at the scene.However, Yeon-woo saw none of that. The only thing that entered his vision was Edora, who was in front of a traditional wedding table. Her face was slightly covered by the luscious sleeves of her clothing. It was the first time in days he\u2019d seen Edora. Now, she was dressed as the main character of this festival.Beautiful, stunning, amazing\u2026 That was what Yeon-woo thought he\u2019d think of when he saw Edora, but standing here, none of those thoughts came to mind. He was just\u2026happy. She was shining so brightly, so he was just happy.\u300eOhohoho. The groom is obviously very nervous! Now, we\u2019ll invite the groom to the front. Then\u2026 Groom, please make your entrance!\u300fLaplace, who was officiating the wedding, shouted into the microphone.Bam ba ba bam.\u00a0Yeon-woo began to walk forward like he was possessed.* * *\u201cHohoho.\u201d\u201cHahaha! It seems he doesn\u2019t know what kind of face he\u2019s making right now.\u201d\u201cRight?\u201dThe guests burst out laughing.Yeon-woo had tried to fix his expression, but his face as he walked down the silk path was still quite a sight to see. The man who was always indifferent and merciless in front of enemies had a face that was stiff as stone, and his movements were jerky and awkward. His hands and feet both moved out at the same time. He looked like a machine that would start creaking because its joints were oiled. The people who knew Yeon-woo well couldn\u2019t stop laughing.\u201cWell, he probably can\u2019t even hear us laughing.\u201d\u201cGood times, good times. He doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s in store for him after today. Whew\u2026!\u201d\u201cOh my, what are you talking about? Are you saying you regret marrying me?\u201d\u201cN-No, wife\u2026 that\u2019s not what I meant\u2026!\u201dThe guests took trips down the memory lane and bickered. But Baal, who was with the demons of L\u2019Infernal in the guest seats, frowned. \u201c\u2026It\u2019s strange how it\u2019s so quiet.\u201dMetatron, who was clapping enthusiastically next to him, turned to Baal and tilted his head. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s just weird.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cI thought that bastard Odin would try something.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d Metatron nodded in understanding. As Baal said, Odin was definitely strangely quiet these last few days. He should\u2019ve been searching for opportunities to get on Yeon-woo and the Martial King\u2019s nerves.\u201cDo you think he\u2019d try to make trouble during the ceremony?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Although Odin is reckless, ruining this ceremony means he's declaring a war of life and death to the tribe, and the other guests won\u2019t just stay still either\u2026 He probably knows better than anyone it\u2019ll just be an act of suicide.\u201d Metatron glanced at where Asgard was. Aside from Olympus, they had the greatest numbers, so it was easy to find where they were.Odin must\u2019ve felt the gaze on him because he turned his one eye to where Metatron was. He looked at Metatron as if asking what his matter was. He even exuded a murderous intent, ready for a fight. It was so very fitting of this title as the Father of the Battlefield. His aura didn\u2019t lack anything compared to a demon\u2019s.Metatron shook his head, signifying it was nothing. Odin\u2019s eyebrows twitched in displeasure, but he didn\u2019t make a scene.\u201cLook. It doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s going to make a fuss. If he does pick a fight, it\u2019ll probably be after the ceremony.\u201dIt was true Odin was pompous, but if that was all there was to him, he wouldn\u2019t have created the society that was Asgard today.\u201cWell, that\u2019s true.\u201d Baal nodded, pulling out a cookie and taking a bite.\u00a0Crunch!\u201cI\u2019m more worried about a certain demon, actually, \u201d Metatron said as he politely denied a cookie Baal offered him.Suddenly, Baal paused eating his cookies, and glared at Metatron with narrowed eyes. He looked like he was telling Metatron to stop speaking immediately, but Metatron wasn\u2019t as benevolent as he looked.\u201cA\u2014!\u201dWhen Metatron opened his mouth again, Baal clapped his hands over his ears and began to make bizarre noises. \u201cBlah blah blah! Blah blah blah!\u201d\u201c\u2014gares\u2026.\u201d\u201cBlah blah! Blah blah blah! That\u2019s weird. Hm? Huh? Why can\u2019t I hear anything? There must be a ringing in my ears. I don\u2019t hear anything! Blah blah blah! Bah bah bah bah!\u201d\u201cWhen is he coming?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t hear you! I said I don\u2019t hear you! Bah bah bah bah!\u201d Baal firmly resisted thinking or hearing of the demon.\u201cIsn\u2019t it about time for him to appear now? Niflheim actually asked if we knew anything about their first lord.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t want to know! I don\u2019t!\u201d Baal was just about to shout at Metatron, who just wouldn\u2019t let the subject go, when he frantically turned around at the ominous feeling that made chills run down his back. \u201cDid this punk\u2026\u201dMetatron also turned around in amusement.On the wall that was surrounding the garden of the palace, which was currently habited by onlookers, something suddenly dropped from the sky.\u00a0Thump!\u201cAhhhhhhh!\u201d\u201cW-What is this?!\u201dThe people around the spot of landing fell from the impact, and all the guests in the vicinity looked toward the crash. The being in question had an aura that stood out among all the gods and demons, so they wondered who it was. No, the\u00a0beings, were\u2026\u201c\u2026A puppy?\u201dWoof!\u00a0Fenrir, who was panting with a cute smile, and Agares, who was transformed into a five-year-old boy.\u201cYou dare! Getting married without my permission! I objeeeeeeeeeect!\u201dAt that moment, the only thought in Metatron\u2019s head was to go hide in a holePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had to bring me in front of the First Star of all beings\u2026!\u2019As an energy source that shone most brilliantly across all worldlines and had near unlimited potential\u2026star fragments were the greatest nourishment for food. So the stars couldn\u2019t help but be curious who the original being who left behind all these fragments were. Many stars called this original the \u201cfirst star,\u201d and they began to investigate it. Then, when they came to a conclusion, they discovered unbelievable accomplishments.A descendant of Shaohao Jintian, the strongest being in the Tower, the king of the One-horned tribe, the destroyer of Asgard, and the Black King\u2019s teacher\u2026 Each achievement was incredible, but this being possessed all of them. Especially the fact that he was the Black King\u2019s teacher was the most shocking.The Black King\u2026in particular, the main ego, Yeon-woo, and the Heavenly Demon, were the two beings the stars avoided the most. The stars had been evading the two because they thought they were ready to stand against them yet, but if the first star was the Black King\u2019s teacher, they were destined to be involved somehow.On one hand, they were fearful of how powerful the first star must be to have created such a monster. And now\u2026Tigris was facing a very powerful being\u2014the first star!\u2018He was destroyed! I heard he was destroyed with the end of Asgard after he became emperor\u2026! Just how\u2026!\u2019The reason the star fragments were able to have such unlimited energy was because of the heights of power the Martial King had reached when he was alive. He was an emperor. It was a level the stars found unimaginable, which was why the fragments were so incredible, but it appeared Yeon-woo had restored the\u00a0emperor.Was that possible? Even if the Black King was the universe itself and had omnipotent power\u2026 Although Tigris was doubtful of how that was possible, he couldn\u2019t refute it because there was a being who was proving the very fact in front of him.Of course, the Martial King wasn\u2019t on the \u201cemperor\u201d level. He was a star, a star who had just realized what he was. His starlight didn\u2019t even reach as far as Tigris\u2019s, but that made Tigris even more scared of him. The Martial King, whose starlight wasn\u2019t even that bright, looked as if he could easily swallow Tigris.Tigris felt like a criminal standing in front of a guillotine. However, he could not even dream of running away. Half of his body was trapped in Yeon-woo\u2019s shadow, and the Divine Iron was tightly bound around his limbs.\u201cHm\u2026\u201d The Martial King seemed blind to Tigris\u2019 feelings as he examined Tigris for a while. \u201cDisciple.\u201d\u201cYes, Seseung-nim.\u201d\u201cThis thing really came from me?\u201d\u201cTo be exact, this guy swallowed something that came from you.\u201d\u201cTomato, tomahto. And he destroyed an entire world?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBut why does he seem so dumb?\u201d\u201cBecause he is.\u201d\u2026Although they were openly mocking him, Tigris couldn\u2019t say anything. No, to be exact, he didn\u2019t even hear it.\u201cNo, that\u2019s why he seems even dumber.\u201d\u201cIn what way?\u201d\u201cWell, duh. If he took something that was from me, even if it was my shit, this guy should look a lot more brave! Musly! Handsome! But this is\u2026\u201d The Martial King trailed off and scanned Tigris again. \u201cThis is just an idiot.\u201d\u201cHmm. I see.\u201d\u201cRight? You agree with my disciple, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cNo. It just occurred to me that there\u2019s a very great disparity between how you really are and what you think of yourself.\u201d\u201cWhat, you punk? Do you wanna get beat up by this teacher of yours with a\u00a0great disparity\u00a0before your wedding?\u201d\u201cStop with the nonsense. You\u2019re going to have to walk the bride in with makeup on your face to cover your bruises.\u201d\u201cHa! Look at you. You\u2019re blatantly being impudent now? They say a teacher is like a father! On top of that, I\u2019m your father-in-law now, so I\u2019m really like another father to you!\u201d\u201cWell, children always take after their parents.\u201d\u201cYou punk!\u201d\u201cDo you really wanna go at it?\u201d\u201cFine. Let\u2019s do it!\u201dThe Martial King lifted his sleeves and Yeon-woo got into stance. They growled at each other.Tigris, who was stuck in between them, continued to tremble. When he turned to the left, Yeon-woo was there, and the Martial King was to his left. This was definitely what it meant to be caught in a crossfire. \u2018Just kill me instead\u2026!\u2019 \u00a0The star who wanted to survive more than anything else just wanted to become free now.* * *Tigris\u2019 wish was accomplished soon enough.\u300eHow old are you to be fighting with your disciple?! Grow up!\u300fThe weary Psychic Medium, who was waiting for Yeon-woo and the Martial King to come out, disrupted them.The Martial King flinched. \u201cNo, the thing is\u2026 This punk keeps on getting on my nerves\u2026!\u201d\u300eNow Cain is your son-in-law, not just your disciple! He is the husband of your\u00a0daughter! We\u2019re family now! Until when are you going to call him \u2018punk?\u2019\u300f\u201cB-But\u2026he was my disciple first\u2026!\u201d\u300eHe was Edora\u2019s acquaintance first! Also! Stop talking back!\u300f\u201cS-Sorry.\u201d The Martial King attempted to counter her, but he ended up being scolded by the Psychic Medium and had to surrender.\u300eJust hurry up and finish!\u300f\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d\u300eAre you okay, son-in-law? You\u2019re not hurt anywhere?\u300f\u201cSob. Sob. My heart was very hurt.\u201d It obviously sounded like Yeon-woo was reading from a book, but it didn\u2019t appear that way to his mother-in-law. And they said taking care of the son-in-law was the mother-in-law\u2019s duty.\u300eOh dear\u2026! Why would someone bother such a kind child like you?!\u300f\u201cI\u2019m all right. I should listen obediently to what my teacher says.\u201d\u300eAnd you\u2019re so humble too\u2026!\u300f\u201cThank you.\u201d Yeon-woo was acting like he was going to jump into his mother-in-law\u2019s arms if she was actually here.The Martial King looked at Yeon-woo in disbelief, but he couldn\u2019t do anything further than that because the Psychic Medium was probably glaring at him. He just beat his chest in frustration.And after that, Yeon-woo and the Martial King returned to the subject at hand.\u201c\u2026So you want me to take this guy\u2019s fragment?\u201d\u201cYes. You need to be complete.\u201dAlthough the Martial King had gained transcendence as a star, he didn\u2019t have a soul, so it wasn\u2019t weird for him to collapse at any moment. The only reason why he still maintained his existence was because of how powerful his conscious ego was.\u201cUhrrm!\u201dTremble, tremble!\u00a0Tigris wanted to scream at the fact that he was going to be offered as a live sacrifice, but his vocal cords were closed off due to fear.\u201cWhat could ever come out of this idiot\u2026? Oh well.\u201dIn all actuality, Yeon-woo didn\u2019t have any reason to keep Tigris alive. It was easier for him to kill the guy and keep it in his soul collection. The collection would keep the soul bound more tightly. But he had brought him alive here to hand over the fragment to the Martial King.Slice![The constellation \u2018Tigris\u2019 has died!]The Martial King swung his hand and Tigris\u2019 head flew in the air.[The star fragment is revealed.]Something floated above the fallen body.\u00a0Whoosh!\u00a0It released a stunning light. It was a light that kept anyone who watched it rapt. Its limitless and warm power had a charm that would naturally pull any human toward it. Even Yeon-woo was surprised by it, so it was likely no one would be free from this magic power.\u201cSo this is a piece of my soul.\u201d No, there was one person: the Martial King. He was looking at the fragment strangely. It was only the Martial King\u2019s existence that had been awakened, so he still didn\u2019t have a soul. He should\u2019ve been pulled toward the fragment more than anybody else, but he was busy observing the fragment.\u201cI suppose the me who died before was really quite incredible. Just a tiny piece is this much. Hahaha!\u201d The Martial King seemed to have mixed feelings as he chuckled. Although he was acting calmly, he had seen something that was nearly his corpse, so it made sense he was feeling strange. \u201cBut can I really eat this? I feel like something bad might happen because there\u2019s a bunch of dirty stuff on it.\u201dTigris\u2019 fragment wasn\u2019t pure in the slightest. Every part of Tigris' life was on it. It was contaminated. Moreover, Tigris had even swallowed the Sagitta and Solarium. There were many other stars he had swallowed somewhere in there as well.The fragment didn\u2019t look too appealing to the Martial King. Even though he wanted to find his soul again, if he swallowed this, the basis of his existence could be ruined.\u201cNo. You don\u2019t need to worry. I\u2019ve already cleaned everything off.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d The Martial King dubiously crossed his arms. The way he was acting was foreign to Yeon-woo.\u2018Is he afraid\u2026?\u2019The Martial King Yeon-woo knew was confident in everything, but he was showing his weak side for what might be the first time. Yeon-woo didn\u2019t know exactly what the Martial King was afraid of. Perhaps it was because of the fear that he might become someone different after swallowing the fragment, or the fact that he had to accept he wasn\u2019t the real Martial King.So Yeon-woo decided to patiently wait for the Martial King to decide. The Martial King was the only one who could empower himself.\u300eHusband.\u300fReading her husband\u2019s mind, the Psychic Medium spoke softly to him.\u300eI want to live until I become a grandma with you.\u300fThe words moved the Martial King, and he uncrossed his arms and stretched a hand out for the fragment. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d His eyes were more determined than ever.Whoosh!\u00a0The absorption of the fragment was rather anticlimactic. When the Martial King\u2019s fingertips touched the piece, the light was sucked into his hand.\u201c\u2026What, that\u2019s it?\u201d It was so unimpressive that the Martial King wondered what he\u2019d been hesitating for. He blinked for a while after it was over.\u201cI told you, sir. You don\u2019t need to worry because I already purified it.\u201d\u201cYeah, I guess. If I knew this was how it\u2019s gonna be\u2026 uh.\u201d\u201cYou were scared.\u201d\u201c\u2026No, I wasn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cI understand. Of course.\u201d\u201cI said I wasn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cHey!\u201d\u300eYou\u2019re at it again?! I said just moments ago to be nice to our son-in-law!\u300f\u201cNo, he keeps on getting on my\u2026\u201d\u300eAgain!\u300f\u201cHe just\u2026!\u201d\u300eAre you okay, son-in-law?\u300f\u201cMy heart just hurt a little more.\u201d\u300eOh, dear!\u300f\u201cArgh\u2026!\u201d The Martial King felt so wronged by this unending cycle of events. He simmered with anger when Yeon-woo smirked at him while pretending to sniff.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 - Allforone (10)And thus, ten years passed.***[A brilliant light distribution fills the space.][Many people admire the dazzling light and naturally bow their heads.][You are gathering faith!][A divine being is being created!]\u2026[Caution! Your spirit power has reached a maximum volume. You cannot retain or collect any further faith. You must grow your maximum levels through exuviation and transcendence.]\u2026[Exuviation was forcibly canceled.][Transcendence was forcibly canceled.]\u2026[Your spirit remains in its original state.][You can no longer accumulate divinity, so it starts to be discharged.][Your light distribution becomes brighter!]\u2026[More followers are praying for you.][More faith is gathered. A divine being is created.]\u2026.[Exuviation has been canceled.]\u2026It was like an endless loop. Over the past ten years, Vivasvat\u2019s performance in the world of the Tower while leading Allforone, influenced countless others and made the gods and demons hostile towards him. Thus, many people started to recognize and place their faith in him. Mortals looked up to him as a savior. They prayed for his victories, and when word of his successive triumphs came, they worshiped with greater fervor.On the other hand, the gods were jealous of Vivasvat. They despised and hated his existence. They felt great indignation at the fact that they could not deal with a mere mortal. Furthermore, they considered Vivasvat\u2019s existence itself as a mockery towards them, as Vivasvat continually accumulated achievements while maintaining his status as a mortal. Whether liked or hated, Vivasvat arguably became the most important figure in the world of the Tower. However, that fact put Vivasvat in even greater danger.Bam!\u201c\u2026It\u2019s this again?\u201d\u300e\u2026It\u2019s this again?\u300fVivasvat muttered in frustration as he stopped meditating and slowly opened his eyes. Along with his physical voice, divine speech also rang out. It was as if several people, not just one, were speaking in unison. It was further proof that he had reached the limits of a mortal and was suppressing his transformation into a god.In fact, it was difficult to say that Vivasvat\u2019s current appearance was absolutely \u2018human\u2019 though he looked the part. The light distribution that had symbolized him even before he entered the Tower was now endlessly radiating around him. He was now immersed in the constant halo of light because he continued to radiate divine power to avoid exuviation and transcendence.The problem was that Vivasvat\u2019s appearance evoked a sense of mystery and almightiness, so the people that previously supported him had now moved to place their absolute faith in him. As a result, Vivasvat gathered greater amounts of faith, and the light distribution became ever brighter.Because of this, even within Allforone, there were many people who had a hard time approaching or relating to Vivasvat. And as the organization grew, a greater number of people started to blindly follow Vivasvat, and those concerned about this were naturally pushed out of Allforone\u2019s leadership. Among those who were pushed out were Garmr and the members of Bifrost, who had always referred to Vivasvat as the \u2018youngest\u2019.[The faith flowing into you has reached another all-time high!]\u2026[The law of causality highly rates your potential.][The current system has designated those who want to interfere with the smooth execution of the floor\u2019s missions as viruses. To resolve this issue, the system is planning to deploy a vaccine program.][Are you willing to accept the system\u2019s suggestion and act as the vaccine program?]Clank. Clank.\u00a0Vivasvat hated the restricting sounds that came from his body. System access, creation of antivirus programs\u2026 Vivasvat knew it would give him the power he needed. Every time he accepted the system\u2019s proposal, he gained unparalleled power\u2026 No, it was more appropriate to state that he was reaching a level of omnipotence.Thanks to this, from a certain point, Vivasvat was no longer being chased. He was now launching massive counterattacks and starting to win. He succeeded in driving out all divine societies from the lower floors.And thanks to that, all the lower floors up to the twentieth floor were now Allforone\u2019s territory. Actually, it was probably more appropriate to state that it was Vivasvat\u2019s territory. Furthermore, his advancement into the twenty-first floor was just around the corner.Vivasvat had essentially acquired the power he had longed for\u2026 But the problem was that, in the process of acquiring this power, many people had drifted away from him, leaving him in isolation. Vivasvat struggled with utter loneliness.Clank.\u00a0At that moment, Vivasvat was pulled from his thoughts when a door opened. The figure who emerged looked at Vivasvat and his light distribution with a face full of rapture. He hurriedly bowed his head when Vivasvat turned his gaze towards him. That action of utter obedience annoyed Vivasvat, who noticed that the man\u2019s expression was closer to worship than respect. Vivasvat could not see an inkling of the man seeing Vivasvat as a fellow comrade. Only these types of people were left in Allforone.\u201cEverything you have ordered has been completed.\u201d\u201c\u2026Everything?\u201d\u300e\u2026Everything?\u300fA strange voice that arose after mixing a physical voice with divine speech.The man\u2019s eyes widened even more. \u201cI ordered their execution, and the executions were finalized a moment ago.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u300eIs that so?\u300f Vivasvat muttered a reply and then fell silent. Execution was a word carved onto his heart like a scar.\u201cWhy? Why did you betray me, Garmr!\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking why\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf we left things as they were, you alone would become Allforone.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026!\u201d\u201cYou know this to be true as well, right? Allforone has become a religious cult organization that centers around you. Of course, if one were to ask the clan members, they\u2019d state that they\u2019re fighting for their freedom and beliefs\u2026 But you know that\u2019s not true, right?\u201d\u201cBut!\u201d\u201cI know. I know what you\u2019re thinking. I know that your heart is in the right place. However, all your actions will eventually lead to a dictatorship and singular power structure\u2026 That eventuality would become a poison for our ultimate endeavors. No, to be frank, it will poison you as well. Your objectives will eventually imprison you and only cause a reiteration of subjugation. That\u2019s why.\u201d\u00a0Garmr\u2019s voice rang clearly in Vivasvat\u2019s ears.\u00a0\u201cPlease open your eyes and see the truth, Vivasvat. That\u2019s my last request.\u201dVivasvat felt fortunate that his figure was covered by his light distribution. He did not have to show his subordinates the tears that flowed down his cheeks. Having come to a state where he was no longer able to properly express his emotions, Garmr\u2019s last words echoed in his mind like a prophecy.\u201cVivasvat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u300eIt\u2019s nothing.\u300fVivasvat slowly got up and shook his head. His recent tears had already evaporated from the heat he was radiating. His trembling gaze had already steadied. The tears he shed just a moment ago were to be the last signs of emotion that exhibited as a \u2018mortal\u2019 being.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u300eLet\u2019s go.\u300fVivasvat had wavered for only the briefest of moments. It was not too late to reflect and possibly regret once he achieved his ultimate objective. The power he currently possessed came after various sacrifices, like the execution of his former colleagues. Thus, Vivasvat was adamant to continue progressing forward.***Time flowed on. Years passed.\u2018Father.\u2019The actions and steps Vivasvat took to find the Heavenly Demon were now cumbersome and weighing down on him. He was going in a slightly different direction from where the Heavenly Demon was.\u2018Where are you?\u2019Vivasvat had reached an age where he had now spent more time in the world of the Tower than when he lived as Son Jae-won. After he met the elder gods and so on, Vivasvat began to vaguely piece together the existence of things like Day and Night. Thus, Vivasvat knew where the Heavenly Demon was. He also knew that the Heavenly Demon was constantly observing him.The system had long ago recognized Vivasvat\u2019s existence as an antivirus. Vivasvat knew this was all the Heavenly Demon\u2019s intention. Nevertheless, he still hated his father for not replying to his call.\u201cIf you can\u2019t come down\u2026\u201d Vivasvat clenched his teeth. \u201c\u2026I\u2019ll go up.\u201dThe Ascent\u2014this was what Vivasvat\u2019s actions came to be called.***\u300eDid you ever have any regrets?\u300fOn the twentieth floor, inside a hidden stage within the floor, Vivasvat was reunited with an old acquaintance. His constricted and hardened heart softened in an instant.Sun Wukong was his father\u2019s friend, who once guided Vivasvat to the world of the Tower. Of course, it was not the real Sun Wukong that Vivasvat had fatefully met outside the Tower. It was Sun Wukong\u2019s exuviate. Still, just seeing the presence of an old acquaintance was enough to please Vivasvat.However\u2026Vivasvat was immediately met with a somewhat heavy line of questioning from Sun Wukong\u2019s exuviate. Sun Wukong exuviate\u2019s golden eyes, which shone bright like jewels, were full of playfulness, but somehow, Vivasvat felt that his soul was being penetrated.\u300eWhat\u2026do you mean?\u300f Vivasvat was now fully in command of his voice. He abandoned his physical voice and only utilized divine speech. To be more precise, he invented a new mode of communication, thought voice. He invented a way to convey his intentions.\u300eDon\u2019t dilly-dally. The question is as it is posed. Do you not regret anything? In my view, you\u2019re doing such nonsensical things.\u300f\u300e\u2026\u300f\u300eTo be honest\u2026you\u2019re making your current actions because you\u2019re rebelling against your father, right?\u300f\u300eWhat\u2026!\u300f\u300eI\u2019m right, huh? Dividing the Heavens and the Earth. Literally dividing the heavenly world from the lower floors\u2026to liberate mortals from divine interference. It\u2019s the same principle and belief that your father and I, another \u2018face\u2019 of him, had long pursued. You\u2019ve just copied us.\u300f\u300e\u2026!\u300f Vivasvat felt that Sun Wukong\u2019s exuviate seemed to smirk.\u300eEven if you lay out a plethora of different reasons, in the end, you\u2019re ultimately just rebelling against your father. You\u2019re suffering this much\u2026 You\u2019re doing this much\u2026 But why is your father not showering you with attention, right? You\u2019re just acting up for attention. Am I wrong?\u300f\u300e\u2026I will not listen any further.\u300f Vivasvat got up from his seat with a look of displeasure. He soon felt a cooling sensation in his heart. The ideal and goal that was the driving force behind his actions and decision\u2026 Vivasvat was faced with an alternative interpretation that what he thought may not be what it seemed. He wondered if his emotions, which had not made an appearance since he shed his last tears, reappeared.\u300eYou won\u2019t be able to go too far. Anyway, stop wandering around like a rebellious teenager and go home. Your father is well aware that you\u2019ve suffered.\u300f\u300e\u2026\u300fVivasvat silently exited the hidden stage\u2019s cave with his mouth tightly shut.***\u201cPlease open your eyes and see the truth, Vivasvat. That\u2019s my last request.\u201d\u00a0Garmr\u2019s last words kept echoing in Vivasvat\u2019s mind like a mantra. After executing his last remaining followers, Vivasvat started dry heaving. His new reality seemed to be haunting him. The thought that his past actions, killing off his lover and colleagues, over the past few decades had all originated from a sense of rebellion\u2026However\u2026 \u2018No. That\u2019s not true. It\u2019s different.\u2019 After reflecting for a long time, Vivasvat regained his senses. \u2018I may have acted that way in the beginning, but now, it\u2019s different.\u2019Vivasvat could not forget the utter elation that he saw in the eyes of the captives who were liberated from the lower floor\u2019s many farms. They cheered at their newfound freedom and their capability to become players. The sensations he felt then remained within him. Furthermore, his actions were not something anyone could do.\u2018Father\u2026 Father just ended up just keeping the gods and demons in one place\u2026but not me. The people here are also important to me.\u2019 Vivasvat clenched his jaw. \u2018No matter how other people see me\u2026 I will protect my people.\u2019Being alone was beneficial. Vivasvat did not care if others called him a loner. Even if other people pointed fingers, even if he was misunderstood, even if he perished without anyone understanding his selfless purpose\u2026Vivasvat was determined to continue. He had no idea what his father was thinking or doing, but Vivasvat felt sure that he would meet his father once more if he continued onward.[It turns out that the law of causality and your will are the same. You have become more tightly coupled to the system.][The antivirus program is being updated.]\u2026\u2018Thus\u2026\u2019 Vivasvat clenched his teeth. \u2018Let\u2019s get rid of everything that is causing me mental anguish\u2026 Cast it all away.\u2019There was a place where he could do this.[You are moving into the twenty-first floor.]***\u2026reminiscing about the past ended here.\u201cIf it is the physical body that gives rise to anguish, wouldn\u2019t casting off one\u2019s physical body, with all of its useless thoughts, onto an illusion on the twenty-first floor be okay? That\u2019s what you thought.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe Heavenly Demon took a sip of his drink as he continued speaking calmly. Nocturne fell silent while looking at the glass.\u201cYou have always been troubled. You were always deep in thought. And, whenever you came out from your thoughts, you moved once more with purpose. There were people who followed you and people who had their hopes on you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSun Wukong called your actions a childish rebellion\u2026 No matter if your initial intentions were based on a sense of rebelliousness, if it becomes your belief, I thought that it would become your path.\u201dAfter stating these words, the Heavenly Demon stopped speaking. A long silence ensued before Nocturne spoke up.\u201c\u2026During all that, when I was eagerly searching for you and awaiting your response\u2026 Why didn\u2019t you reply?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll sound like an excuse\u2026 Ah\u2026\u201d The Heavenly Demon sighed as he crossed his arms. His sigh was full of bitterness and sorrow. \u201cAt the time, I did not have the mental capacity to think of anything else. I was vaguely aware that you came into the Tower looking for me, but my body was already exhausted from the long battle I had with the Black King, so I fell into a deep slumber\u2026 Within this library, my mind did not operate normally. Moreover, I was already overwhelmed just maintaining the Tower\u2026\u201dNocturne now knew the fact that the Ruyi Bang had been utilized to create the Tower to suppress the Black King from awakening from his \u2018dream\u2019. By imprisoning the gods and heroes within the Tower, a greater suppressing weight would weigh down on the Black King.\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d Just when the Heavenly Demon was about to continue speaking\u2026[Another librarian has entered the Changgong Library.]\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt your conversation.\u201dHearing the sudden voice, the Heavenly Demon and Nocturne\u2019s eyes turned towards the speaker. Nocturne looked slightly startled at seeing the figure\u2019s face, but Nocturne soon realized that the temperament exuded from this newcomer was quite different from the figure he had previously met. Nocturne nodded his head.It was Deus Ex Machina, Cha Jeong-woo, appointed by the Heavenly Demon as the new librarian of the Changgong Library. For whatever reason, Jeong-woo\u2019s expression did not look good.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why are you wearing such a downcast expression? Did something happen?\u201d The Heavenly Demon tilted his head, wondering what was wrong. Now that the long battle over the \u2018wheel\u2019 and \u2018dream\u2019 with the Black King was over, the Heavenly Demon felt that there was no longer cause for any large concern.However, after hearing Cha Jeong-woo\u2019s words, the Heavenly Demon and Nocturne\u2019s expressions hardened.\u201cMy brother.\u201d Cha Jeong-woo\u2019s voice quavered. \u201cMy brother\u2026disappeared after rewinding the \u2018wheel\u2019.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ahem.\u201d Kronos bit his lower lip to stop laughing, but he couldn\u2019t stop the corners of his mouth from twitching. Sesha vented to Kronos about how wronged she felt about what happened in the morning, but the way she spoke was too cute.If Kronos had to pick the greatest joys of his life these days, it would be the growth of his youngest daughter and his adolescent granddaughter. His life hadn\u2019t been the smoothest, and he wasn\u2019t able to love and pamper his children. So, now, he was giving all the love he missed out on to these children.Of course, raising children wasn\u2019t easy. Playing with kids was more exhausting than expected. And when the kids entered the period of being troublemakers\u2026 It was an understatement to say it was tiring. Still, they grew up a little every day, and it was adorable to watch.This child, Sesha, who was just a tiny six-year-old was now on the verge of becoming an adult. It felt quite strange.\u201cHumph.\u201dEven now, the way Sesha turned around and pouted angrily was adorable. It seemed like yesterday she followed Kronos around saying \u201cGrandpa, Grandpa,\u201d but she had grown up so much.\u201cOur princess is angry again, I see.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d Sesha\u2019s words clearly didn\u2019t match her actions.\u201cI wonder what I should do to appease our princess?\u201d\u201cHumph.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026\u201d Kronos stepped on the brakes when the traffic light turned red and began to rummage around the backseats. Sesha pretended not to care, but she peeked glances behind her. A slight smile appeared on Kronos\u2019 face as he added, \u201cI think a new model of that tablet came out recently\u2026\u201dTwitch.\u201cI must be getting old. I bought this because someone said they wanted it, but I can\u2019t seem to remember who.\u201dTwitch, twitch!\u201cShould I just give it to Ye-eun? It seems like kids these days watch stuff on their tablets\u2026\u201d\u201cHehehehe. Grandpa, the light turned green. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Sesha intertwined an arm around Kronos\u2019 right arm and beamed. From her mini tantrum to a wide smile, it was a rapid transformation. Kronos chuckled at her obvious actions.\u201cYup, let\u2019s go.\u201dThe car began to move again.\u201cBut really, who should I give this to\u2026?\u201d\u201cGrandpa, Grandpa.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cAs you know, I started a new semester recently. But trying to take notes on all my subjects is hard. Sometimes I forget a notebook, and sometimes I get confused and write in the wrong one, so I have to do it twice. Sounds difficult, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cOh my, nothing should come in between my princess and her studies! Should I get you a recording machine then? Or maybe a package of notebooks?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. It\u2019s the twenty-first century on Earth right now and the period of electrical advancement. Should our tools also change to match? And I can watch online lectures too, hm?\u201d\u201cOh, so you want to take lectures at a cram school. Is there a particular one you want to attend? I heard once that Daechi-dong is well known for\u2014\u201d\u201cGrandpa!\u201d Sesha became upset as Kronos danced around the subject.\u201cGoodness, that surprised me. You're going to give me a heart attack. My heart\u2019s already weak enough.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s hard to believe coming from someone who has divinity!\u201d\u201cHehe. You got me.\u201d\u201cTsk. You\u2019re just like Dad sometimes!\u201d Even so, Sesha was smiling. \u201cAnyway, please? Can you give it to me as a present for starting high school?\u201d\u201cI remember getting you a game console for that, no?\u201d\u201cNope, that was my birthday present. And I need the tablet for studying. Please?\u201dKronos was about to remind Sesha he gifted her clothes on her birthday, but he surrendered when he saw her shining eyes. He had gotten the tablet for Sesha anyway. \u201cAll right, you have it.\u201d\u201cYes! You\u2019re the best, Grandpa. Thank you.\u201d Sesha hugged the tablet to her chest and excitedly kissed Kronos on the cheek. She said she wouldn\u2019t kiss him on the cheek anymore since she was older, but it seemed the present was quite effective.* * *Sesha sat on the edge of her seat as she hummed. There couldn\u2019t be a greater joy than organizing and downloading necessary applications on her new tablet.\u201cOoh! Newbie! Who gave that to you? Your boyfriend?\u201dJust then, someone popped out from behind the tablet. It was Park Yoo-min, Sesha\u2019s desk partner who had become her best friend.\u201cA boyfriend? Please.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cMy grandfather,\u201d Sesha said proudly.\u201cWhoa! Your grandpa gets you stuff like this?\u201d\u201cI said I wanted this in passing some time ago, and he must\u2019ve remembered.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s meticulous too! It isn\u2019t easy for grandfathers to be like that. Must be because he lives young.\u201dPark Yoo-min once happened to see Kronos as he dropped Sesha off to school. Kronos looked so young that she thought he was an older brother or uncle. She remembered being surprised when Sesha told her he was her grandfather. The same went with Sesha\u2019s mom, Ananta. She knew Ananta had been on television a few times back when Sesha was a player, but she really was beautiful and looked young enough to be Sesha\u2019s older sister. And even Sesha\u2019s father, who came by the front of the school to give Sesha the lunchbox she left at home.Yoo-min didn\u2019t think there could be any parents more beautiful than Sesha's. Rumors spread around the entire school that there was a reason why Sesha became famous as a pretty player. It was the power of genes.\u201cMy Grandpa\u2019s just attentive.\u201d Sesha looked happy boasting about her grandfather.\u201cMy grandfather just scolds me about my grades\u2026\u201d Yoo-min grumbled, then looked at the clock on the wall, calculating how much time they had left before class started. \u201cWanna go to the school store?\u201dGrowl.\u00a0Sesha was about to decline, but the rumble in her stomach told her not to.Park Yoo-min giggled. \u201cWanna go?\u201dSesha started to nod when she suddenly recalled the breakfast Ananta told her to eat before leaving. She had grumbled and left without eating any of the food her mom woke up early to prepare for her. What did her mom do about it? Did she throw it away? Or did she finish the leftovers because she didn\u2019t want them to go to waste?\u2018\u2026I hope she didn\u2019t.\u2019 Sesha\u2019s head was cramped with all kinds of questions.\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cO\u2026kay, then.\u201d Sesha nodded absently. She felt a bit apologetic to her mom.* * *The student store was located behind the school building. Chatting with Yoo-min about what kinds of snacks to eat today, Sesha headed down the stairs and saw the store was busier than normal. \u201cArgh! Why are there so many people today?\u201d\u201cYeah, maybe there\u2019s some new menu item?\u201dThey neared the store, but the crowd didn\u2019t become any smaller. They wondered if they should just return at a later time.Sesha had been through all kinds of dangerous situations growing up, and her life had been in the spotlight even on Earth, so she didn\u2019t enjoy places that bustled with people. She was about to suggest they go back to Yoo-min, but Yoo-min stood on her toes and nodded in understanding at what she saw.\u201cOh! Sung-chan\u2019s over there.\u201d\u201cSung-chan? Who\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cHuh? You don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cWho is he?\u201d\u201c\u2026Wow. So clueless to the things around you. This is the problem with popular kids. Don\u2019t say that in front of Sung-chan, \u2018kay? He\u2019ll probably be hurt.\u201d\u201cSo, who is he?\u201d\u201cYou really don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t remember the kid who confessed to you last month?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just one or two people.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, yes, yes. Of course.\u201dPark Yoo-min shook her head in mock disgust. Yoo-min liked Sesha, and they were good friends. Sesha was pretty on the outside, and she\u00a0was\u00a0actually a bit picky. But she was extremely generous to those close to her, and she cared so much for her friends that she was almost intrusive. However, toward those she didn\u2019t care for or weren\u2019t in her circle, she was ruthlessly indifferent. She didn\u2019t care what they said or did, and when Yoo-min asked her about it, she just replied half-heartedly. Then, she would forget about it.Sesha had clear likes and dislikes, and she despised doing things she didn\u2019t want to. Even for the things that weren\u2019t much trouble, she would straight-up say no or distance herself from them. This was why many of the people who first approached Sesha for her fame didn\u2019t attempt to befriend her, and Sesha only had about five or six people who were actually friends, including Yoo-min.It wasn\u2019t all too different for the guys who confessed to her. There was at least one boy in every class who was turned down by Sesha\u2019s indifference, and if you counted those who had crushes on her, they would probably fill one entire truck.\u201cAnyway, so Sung-chan? Chan-sung? Who is he, and why are there so many people?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s an idol.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNot you, silly. He\u2019s the idol that sings.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d\u201cYou might not know it, but he\u2019s super famous. I heard he\u2019s filming something at school before he goes on his tour for North America. Maybe this is because of that?\u201dSesha used her abilities to sense inside the store. There really was some boy making small talk to a camera while surrounded by students. She asked, \u201cHow do\u00a0you\u00a0know so well?\u201d\u201cHeehee. My bias is a member of that group. I asked Sung-chan for a signature, I hope he didn\u2019t forget.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s a bias?\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you a grandma?\u201d Yoo-min then explained \u201cbias\u201d meant one\u2019s favorite member in a group or band, even giving examples.\u201cWhy\u2019s there so much slang? Last time you confused me with all those acronyms or something.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re OOTL.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cOut of the loop. Geez. It\u2019s been a long time since that one\u2019s been out. They don\u2019t even use it anymore.\u201d Then, Yoo-min grinned as she pulled her phone out. \u201cDo you wanna see my bias?\u201d\u201cNo. Hey! I said no!\u201d\u201cC\u2019mon, just once.\u201dSesha was about to push the phone aside, but Yoo-min already started a video. There was nothing that made a fan more passionate than spreading word about their bias. In the end, Sesha was forced to watch a video she didn\u2019t want to. It was a recorded video of a live session of a guy interacting with fans.\u201cHuh\u2026? Him?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think? So cute, isn\u2019t he? Eeek! Our Jin-ho oppa just looks icy on the outside, he\u2019s actually super sweet and\u2014\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this Lee Jin-ho?\u201d\u201cOh, so even you know him! Of course. Everyone knows our Jin-ho oppa\u2014\u201d\u201cI met him last year when I was on TV.\u201dPark Yoo-min\u2019s eyes started to sparkle. \u201cA-A-A-re you close?\u201d\u201cNo. I don\u2019t even know his number. I guess his surgery went well.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cHis surgery went well. He said he was going to do his nose last time, and he really did. Looks like he touched his eyes too. He looked better before, if you ask me. What happened?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?! My oppa was born this way!\u201d\u201cBorn that way? He was made that way. Do you want to know where else he did? Last year, he did surgery on\u2026\u201dYoo-min unwittingly heard her bias\u2019 weakness and her gaze began to shake more tumultuously.\u00a0Crash!\u00a0The fantasies in her head came crashing down.Sesha didn\u2019t notice. She found it interesting that someone she was on TV with last year and someone who confessed to her\u2015although she didn\u2019t remember\u2015were in the same group. The world really was a small place.\u201cLet\u2019s go back up since we\u2019re not gonna be able to get anything\u2026!\u201dSesha pulled Yoo-min\u2019s park to go up to their class, but the crowd suddenly split like the Red Sea and the male student and cameraman Sesha sensed earlier came running her way. Shin Sung-chan waved with a smile at Sesha. \u201cHey! You\u2019re here! Hi, So-young! Are you here to see me?\u201dThe camera turned to Sesha, who furrowed her eyebrows. She wondered what this bastard was planning to do.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Clamor, clamor.\u00a0The wedding ceremony instantly turned into chaos.\u201cW-What\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cExactly. That\u2019s what I want to ask.\u201dJ\u00f6rmungandr had a dumbfounded expression. He\u2019d had a feeling Fenrir might be up to something since he hadn\u2019t seen him in a while\u2026but to think he\u2019d create this big a problem! J\u00f6rmungandr wanted to hide in a hole. He also wanted to shut his ears, but his damned perception senses didn\u2019t miss what the guests were muttering among themselves.\u201cHuh! Disrupting an event of Arthia and the One-horned tribe! What are they thinking?\u2019\u2018They\u2019re probably not thinking at all.\u2019\u201cBut isn\u2019t that Agares and Fenrir?\u201d\u2018Please don\u2019t recognize them\u2026\u2019\u201cThey\u2019re not just anyone, but they\u2019re well-known transcendents\u2026! Was there some secret negotiation we don\u2019t know about with this wedding and Arthia and the One-horned? Something that could potentially affect the entire Tower\u2026?\u201d\u2018They\u2019re just fools who don\u2019t think\u2026\u2019The murmuring guests were starting to make conspiracies now. J\u00f6rmungandr wanted to go and answer each of the guests\u2019 questions, but he didn\u2019t have the mind to.\u300eSo cool\u2026!\u300fJust then, J\u00f6rmungandr heard a crazy statement. He spun to the side, and Hel\u2019s eyes were sparkling as she clasped her hands together. She looked like a young girl who was looking at some beautiful story in a fairy tale.J\u00f6rmungandr\u2019s face crumpled.\u300eWhat do you mean \u2018cool?!\u2019\u300f\u300eThat resistance against fate! Strong determination to get one\u2019s love back! How could I not be touched?\u300f\u300eWhat kind of bullshit is that?!\u300fHel blinked at J\u00f6rmungandr\u2019s shout.\u300eYou mean, dog, not bull? Oldest brother is a dog.\u300f\u300e\u2026You mean wolf! Anyway, he\u2019s just making a scene for the fun of it!\u300fIt was obvious based on how Fenrir\u2019s tail was spinning like a propeller. Fenrir was just enjoying causing a fuss. He was receiving attention, and he could also receive Yeon-woo\u2019s attention\u2026 Fenrir was as much of an attention-seeker as Hel. Perhaps it was a sibling trait.\u2018Niflheim will be ruined at this rate! I somehow need to get my troublemaker brother out of there.\u2019 Once again, the idea that J\u00f6rmungandr needed to end this situation strongly occurred to him. However, because Fenrir had been resolved to create a mess, J\u00f6rmungandr had no way of stopping him. In terms of brute strength, Fenrir was the greatest in their society. Still, there was one person who could stop Fenrir. It was the prince of Niflheim, and the father of the siblings, Loki\u2026\u300eHahaha! As expected of my son! Yes! I was worried that it might end only being boring like this!\u300fHowever, Loki was keeling over in laughter. He was chewing on a piece of calamari, and his legs were outstretched hanging on the chair in front of him. He clearly did not have any intention of stepping up and stopping this situation.\u2018Fuck.\u2019 J\u00f6rmungandr was flabbergasted \u2018We\u2019re done for. We\u2019re all done for. Our society will be destroyed soon\u2026 Destroyed\u2026 Ha, hahaha\u2026\u2019While J\u00f6rmungandr laughed in disbelief, having given up\u2026\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d Yeon-woo crumpled his face and glared at Agares and Fenrir. He was smiling widely at how pretty Edora was, but the two had come and ruined it. He wanted to kick them far away, but he stopped himself since today was a special day. He didn\u2019t want to create greater chaos either. Still, he glared at them in annoyance.Of course, neither Agares nor Fenrir seemed afraid of Yeon-woo in the slightest.\u201cDuh! I object! To this marriage!\u201dWoof! Woof woof!Agares put his hand on his hips and bellowed. He seemed to be trying to make a threatening face, but there was a limit to how scary and dignified he could look as a little child. The same went with Fenrir, who was in his puppy form. Why was his tail wagging so excitedly\u2026?\u201cExactly, why?\u201d\u201cJust cause! I\u2019m just objecting!\u201dWoof woof woof!Fenrir nodded in agreement. Yeon-woo opened his Fiery Golden Eyes and narrowed his eyes at the two. As he did, he could read Fenrir\u2019s mind.If he gets married, he can\u2019t play with me! So of course I should object!\u201c\u2026\u201d Yeon-woo looked at them in disbelief. Agares\u2019 thoughts probably weren\u2019t too different from Fenrir\u2019s either.\u2018Causing a fuss at my wedding just so they can play with me, those ruffians\u2026 I should just send them flying away.\u2019 It was Yeon-woo\u2019s fault for thinking perhaps there was a legitimate reason. Yeon-woo lifted his long sleeves up and pulled out his right hand, thinking it would be best to just get rid of them.\u201cDamn it! Puppy! Careful! It seems that punk is trying to censor the media!\u201dWoof!Agares and Fenrir attempted to escape, sensing their failure at how Yeon-woo was coming out. They weren\u2019t quick to catch on, unfortunately.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll show you what it really means to censor the media.\u201d Yeon-woo glowered.But just then, Baal appeared behind Agares and snatched his collar. \u201cStop, you crazy bastards! This is so embarrassing!\u201d\u201cBaal! What are you doing! Let go!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s everyone in L\u2019Infernal doing! Hurry and get rid of this damned bastard!\u201d Baal ignored Agares\u2019 resistance and tossed him to where the demon kings of L\u2019Infernal were.\u201cLet\u2026 Uuumph! Urmrrmrh!\u201d Agares kicked and struggled, but the demon kings quickly tied Agares up and gagged him, then left in a hurry. Even the demon kings, who were confident in how brazen they were, were so embarrassed at this situation that they quickly wanted to get out of here.The same went with Niflheim.Woof! Grrrrr.Fenrir, who attempted to quickly escape outside of the wall, was faced by a barricade created by J\u00f6rmungandr and his subordinates\u2026 No, it was a barricade of demons. They looked hilarious, each of them holding a butterfly net or dog chew toy in their hands. However, their faces were more grave than ever. A few of them swallowed in nervousness.Fenrir growled at them to get out of the way. He looked adorable in a way, but J\u00f6rmungandr\u2019s face was nothing but one of annoyance.\u300eGo get that son of a\u2026 I mean, that dog of a brother here.\u300f\u300eYes, sir!\u300f\u300eWill do!\u300fWoof! Woof!\u300eAnd make that damned barking stop! Why the heck is he keeping up that concept and not talking?\u300fFenrir and the demons clashed.\u00a0Crash, rumble!\u201c\u2026\u201d Seeing the scene, Yeon-woo let his sleeves back down again. Then, he pressed his throbbing temples.* * *\u201c\u2026What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWhat a shitshow.\u201d\u201cI have no idea what\u2019s going on.\u201dWhile Agares and Fenrir\u2019s rebellion was quickly suppressed, the guests all looked dumbstruck or confused. Based on what they saw, the conspiracies that were brought up seemed to be wrong.\u300eAll right, ladies and gentlemen! Please focus over here again! There was a small problem, but it has successfully been suppressed! The wedding will begin again!\u300fThe guests tiled their heads, but they focused on the wedding again under Laplace\u2019s guidance. Something was definitely strange, but this was an event of the One-horned tribe anyway. Considering their peculiarity, this was nothing.Moreover, the eldest couple here, Kronos and Rhea, and the Martial King and Psychic Medium were busy laughing. They didn\u2019t seem too concerned.\u300eAll right, then we will now begin the bowing of the groom and bride\u2026!\u300fLaplace moved the mic to his mouth and was about to continue with the ceremony, when something suddenly flashed from the guests\u2019 seats.\u00a0Fwoosh! Slice!\u00a0And before he could finish, his entire body was split in half. Black shadows spurted out like blood. It was such a sudden occurrence that the guests thought they were all seeing things for a moment.\u201cKyaaak!\u201d\u201cWhat is it this time\u2026?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an attack! It\u2019s an attack!\u201dWith the shouts of those who quickly recollected their bearings, another flash of light fell above the guests. Heimdall, Thor, Frigg, T\u00fdr\u2026 They were the gods of Asgard.\u201cEveryone.\u201d Odin sat alone, legs-crossed, in the section where all the gods of Asgard had been sitting. \u201cKill them all. Every single one of them.\u201d[Asgard\u2019s divine punishment has commenced!]Kraaaa! Crash, rumble! Kra kra kra!\u00a0The aura that spread from Odin became a storm and instantly covered the garden and the palace. An eerie cry rang in the air, and lightning poured down between the powerful winds.Odin\u2019s domain was a rainstorm of death. Its level of destructiveness couldn\u2019t be put in words.\u201cI had my doubts, but you really\u2026!\u201d Baal paused from taking care of Agares and widened his eyes at the pandemonium Odin caused.What Agares had done could be reduced to a thoughtless accident, but Odin and Asgard\u2019s actions were the very opposite of that. It was a declaration of war on Arthia and the One-horned tribe, and it was tarnishing the reputation of Malach, L\u2019Infernal, and countless other societies. Asgard was declaring war on the entire heavenly world!\u300eDemons of L\u2019Infernal!\u300fBaal\u2019s voice was angrier than ever. Demonic energy echoed as he spoke in his true voice. His bellow rang loud and clear in the sky.All the demon kings looked up. At that moment, even the struggling Agares looked up at Baal unblinking and obediently. A command from their leader Baal was absolute. So even if Agares had caused much trouble in the past, he never evaded his duties.\u300eDaring to create a mess in a location where we are present is a mockery of L\u2019Infernal!\u300fBaal\u2019s eyes flashed murderously.\u300eTear apart the gods of Asgard.\u300f\u300eYes, sir!\u300f\u300eYes, sir!\u300fPaat! Whoosh!\u00a0The demon kings dashed forward toward the gods of Asgard, and Agares returned to his original form, unfurling his tens of pairs of black wings.\u300eYou dare attempt to touch me?\u300fAgares\u2019 eyes flashed dangerously.[Agrares\u2019 power, Wicked Evil, is revealed!]\u300eI\u2019ll do more than tear you apart. I\u2019ll rip you to shreds.\u300fOoooo.\u00a0With Agares at the lead, the demons of L'Infernal followed closely after the gods of Asgard and began their attack.\u00a0Pow pow pow.\u201cArchangels of Malach, assist L\u2019Infernal!\u201dOn Metatron\u2019s command, Michael and the other archangels quickly got to action. However, unlike Baal, who was blinded by hury, Metatron\u2019s eyes were silent as the sea. \u2018Something is strange. I don\u2019t feel any will from the eyes of the gods of Asgard.\u2019Although Odin was arrogant, it didn\u2019t make sense that he was acting out so recklessly.\u00a0Crash!\u00a0Regardless, the chaos became bigger. The palace quaked as if it would fall any moment.\u201cHaha. Shall we leave now?\u201d Leo slowly stood up from where he was with his subordinates and began to walk through the storm. Slowly, like he was out for a stroll.\u00a0Step, step\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Edora was someone he couldn\u2019t help but feel apologetic to\u2014a lover he had made to wait for years. Also, she was someone he had also yearned for a long time. He was always next to Edora and wished her happiness.Yeon-woo did pray she would stop waiting for him to return and find someone else. Even if she forgot him, Yeon-woo would\u2019ve encouraged her instead of resenting her. When they met later, he planned on thanking her for everything. Because of Edora, because of the woman who always smiled peacefully, he was able to endure the lonely years he had to spend alone. He felt his mind being refreshed just by looking at her face, and he was able to bear the wait.However, even in the end, Edora didn\u2019t move on for her happiness. She waited for Yeon-woo, and she was able to hold his hand right before her end.Yeon-woo would be eternally grateful to Edora. Although she wouldn\u2019t know what happened then, that didn\u2019t matter. Rather, he was grateful she didn\u2019t know. The long wait must've been a repetition of pain for her.Pause!\u00a0But Edora suddenly stopped running toward Yeon-woo. Her eyes were trembling as she looked into his eyes.Yeon-woo wondered what was the matter and belatedly realized the reason. \u2018Insight!\u2019 He hadn\u2019t thought about her skill. They were the eyes that uncovered all shrouds to see the truth that lay beyond. Edora\u2019s Insight was attempting to look deep into Yeon-woo\u2019s existence.Yeon-woo belatedly summoned his magic power to block Edora\u2019s skill, but she had already read a vast amount of information. It showed her enough of what she needed to know. However, the problem was that it was too much for a mortal like Edora to handle.Drip.\u201cOra\u2026boni\u2026 Just how\u2026\u201dTears fell down Edora\u2019s cheeks. She didn\u2019t even have the mind to wipe them. Her unfocused eyes were quickly scanning the reality that had been. The Edora who existed before the wheel was rewound now overlapped with her. After Yeon-woo\u2019s loneliness swept past, the pain and sadness she experienced settled over her.A moment later, Edora slowly began to walk to Yeon-woo. Then, she opened her arms and pulled him close, as if he didn\u2019t need to explain anything. Yeon-woo ended up staying in her arms, but he didn\u2019t push her away. He just closed his eyes.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBetween the two lovers, no other conversation was necessary. They could communicate enough with just silence. It was possible because they both knew how the other felt.Then, Yeon-woo slowly removed his face from Edora\u2019s embrace. When they met each other\u2019s eyes, a smile appeared on both their faces. It was so comical that they both laughed. Then, when they met each other\u2019s eyes again, their faces moved slowly toward each other.Yeon-woo\u2019s eyes naturally closed and the sound of Edora\u2019s breathing became closer. Edora\u2026smelled like mint. It was a fresh and light scent. Reveling in her scent, he moved his lips toward Edora\u2019s. But before their lips could touch\u2026Boom!\u00a0A sudden explosion rang out and intense heat storms swept past them. Phante and the Martial King had already begun their fight. It was impossible to kiss Edora, let alone stay standing amidst all the sand and pebbles raining down.\u2018Damn it.\u2019 Yeon-woo narrowed his eyes at the two who had disrupted his reunion with his lover. Phante and the Martial King didn\u2019t even care what Yeon-woo and Edora were doing. They were just busy trying to fight each other.Haa!\u00a0Phante shouted with a gust of wind, and the Martial King stomped the ground with a snort. The earth rose up to a wall that was tens of meters high and blocked the consecutive Myriad Lightning.\u00a0Krrrr.\u00a0As the mountain was destroyed, rocks fell atop the Martial King\u2019s head.\u2018Phante, you\u2019ll pay for this later.\u2019 Yeon-woo determined he\u2019d make another black eye on Phante\u2019s face as he waved his hand in the air. The atmosphere shifted to erect a barrier. He separated the space from Phante and the Martial King, and it was just Edora and Yeon-woo here now.\u201cLet\u2019s do it again.\u201d Yeon-woo looked at Edora with blazing eyes. Edora flushed, feeling slightly shy, but she nodded and closed her eyes, saying she was ready. She looked beautiful.Gulp.\u00a0Yeon-woo subconsciously swallowed from nervousness. It wasn\u2019t the first time he was seeing Edora\u2019s face this close, but his heart pumped faster as if it was.\u00a0Thump. Thump. Thump.\u00a0No, it was beating faster than their first time. His body gave off heat because his blood began to circulate faster. He thought he might breathe out steam if he opened his mouth.\u2018But my real body is a dragon\u2019s\u2026\u2019Yeon-woo\u2019s real body was a dragon that was as large as a galaxy. Was his real body\u2019s heart beating this fast? Then how fast was his blood circulating for his body to feel so hot? All kinds of unnecessary thoughts swept past his mind. It was probably because he was more nervous than when they first confirmed each other\u2019s feelings on their way to save Kalatus.Yeon-woo mustered the courage and moved his lips toward Edora\u2019s.Krrrrng! Urrrr, crash! Krrr, kra, kra, kra! Du du du\u2026\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe explosions that boomed without rest didn\u2019t provide them a good atmosphere. How recklessly were they fighting for the explosions to be heard through the barrier? Yeon-woo was starting to feel annoyed. Just then\u2026\u00a0Bam! Crack.\u00a0Suddenly, something fell atop the barrier. As a result, the barrier cracked like glass, and a large object divided Yeon-woo and Edora.\u201cShucks\u2026! Why can\u2019t I even lay a finger on him though I\u2019m doing this much\u2026? What\u2019s he eating to make him so strong at that age?\u201d Phante, who was covered in dust, forced himself up while gritting his teeth. Far up in the sky, he could see the Martial King arrogantly looking down at him. The idol Phante tried to surpass for the last tens, no, hundreds of years, was too strong. He wondered if it was possible for someone to be that powerful. He even awakened divinity, so he couldn\u2019t believe he was losing so badly.Phante understood why the elders of the tribe described his father as a monster, and why his master, the Head Elder, looked at him with pity in his eyes up until his last moments. The Head Elder and the adults all knew that no matter how much Phante kicked and struggled, he would never escape the shadow of the Martial King.That was how amazing the Martial King was. In fact, it was obvious when you looked at his name. He was the king of martial arts. Ordinary players easily resorted to calling him that, since the tribe chief position of the One-horned tribe was truly great.However, what was important was that even the tribe members\u2014the lofty people who were very prideful of martial arts and didn\u2019t even dare joke about it\u2014didn\u2019t hesitate to call him by this moniker. However\u2014Crackle!\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s more fun.\u201d The fire inside Phante grew bigger. The moment he released the power he\u2019d been saving for last resort, his entire body was covered with blood-red lightning, and thunder boomed throughout the atmosphere because of him. Lightning God, or Blood God\u2026 Phante\u2019s current prowess could be described by such monikers. He was a god who looked invincible, a god who stood above all else.The Martial King made a strange expression as he looked at his son and wagged his finger. \u2018Come.\u2019 The Martial King was accepting the challenge thrown to him by the challenger who was trying desperately to escape his shadow.\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll be scared if you do that? Bring it on!\u201d Phante flashed a wide vicious smile and was about to kick off from the ground.\u201cPhante.\u201d At the voice that suddenly called his name, Phante turned around. Yeon-woo was glaring at him with Edora held tight in his arms. Edora\u2019s face was also filled with annoyance. Hadn\u2019t they gone elsewhere? Phante was about to ask why the two were still here, when\u2026\u201cBite down.\u201d\u201c\u2026?!\u201d Before Phante could say anything, Yeon-woo\u2019s fist flew toward him. It was directly on the other eye opposite of where he\u2019d been punched earlier.\u00a0Craaack!\u00a0The sound was a lot louder too.* * *\u201cOho.\u201d The Martial King looked down at where Phante was quite literally being stepped on.Phante was in the middle of using his lightning to try and resist, but everytime Yeon-woo kicked him it fizzled out. Yeon-woo wasn\u2019t using an efficient martial art or displaying spectacular enlightenment. He was just \u201cpushing down\u201d Phante with his overwhelming difference in strength.\u2018Even though Phante seems to have transcended long ago.\u2019 The Martial King didn\u2019t know what happened in the future, but it was clear Allforone was gone from that world, and Yeon-woo and Phante must have suffered from the chaos that ensued. The fact that Phante was able to transcend meant Allforone had been absent. \u2018No. It seems like he\u2019s already disappeared from here too.\u2019The disappearance of Allforone, who had always been a large mountain blocking the Martial King, came as quite a surprise to him.\u2018And\u2026I\u2019m gone from that future too.\u2019 The Martial King was certain that there had been no spot of his in the world of Yeon-woo and Phante. If there was, the two wouldn\u2019t have come to see him like this. He probably hadn\u2019t merely retired, either.The Martial King he knew\u2014the man named Nayu\u2014was someone who would be fighting on the battlefield to his last days, standing shoulder to shoulder and laughing and drinking with his tribe members. That meant not too far into the future, he was going to die.Absolute. Death.\u00a0The divination the Martial King\u2019s wife had seen popped into his head. Was it related to that? He thought it did. He might seem like he was bragging about his wife, but his wife\u2019s skill was truly amazing.Another question arose from there. With Yeon-woo and Phante having rewound the wheel to return to the present, where was this newly spinning world headed? Did fate, his damned divination, change?\u201cWifey.\u201d\u300e\u2026I\u2019m looking right now.\u300fIt seemed the couple was really connected somehow after being together for so long. The Psychic Medium replied immediately in a grumbling tone. She had reached the same conclusion and was seeing into the future.\u300eJust a moment.\u300fAnd in her words, the Martial King was able to tell her certain voice wasn\u2019t so certain this time. That could only mean one thing. \u201cThe divination\u2019s the same, huh?\u201d\u300e\u2026\u300fThere was no response.Psh!\u00a0The Martial King smirked. He could picture what expression his wife was making, as well as the results of the divination in front of her. His damned fate hadn\u2019t changed yet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Second Life RankerCH ss - 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySide Story Chapter 25 - One-horn (10)\u201cSomething similar\u2026to what I did?\u201d\u00a0The Martial King did not say anything for a long time after hearing Yeon-woo\u2019s explanation. Later, he came to understand what Yeon-woo meant. The Psychic Medium, never thinking of such a solution, had remained silent as well.When he finally opened his mouth to speak, the Martial King could tell that his voice was trembling.He had pretended to be okay until now. He, too, had inevitably been shaken by Yeon-woo\u2019s explanation. However, he was not agitated by his existence.It was because of Nocturne. It was because of the wounds Nocturne had suffered. Nocturne\u2019s origin was something that the Martial King wanted to hide no matter what. Or perhaps, it was the greatest mistake that the Martial King regretted. The fact that his disciple found out about his mistakes, which he had made while he was half crazy due to resentment against Allforone, made his heart throb. He felt shame towards Yeon-woo, and he felt sorry for Nocturne.Nocturne eventually found out about his true identity, and his intense resentment had driven him to annihilate the Martial King, who could not fathom a guess on the extent of Nocturne\u2019s resentment.\u201cYes. I brought the shadow that master left in the \u2018Shadow Dojo\u2019 on the twenty-first floor. And\u2026I backed up the records and data that were engraved on Idea and overlaid it into this world\u2019s data.\u201dYeon-woo could be called the ruler of the entire world. Since all the foundations of this universe were derived from the Black King\u2019s \u2018dream\u2019, it was not difficult for Yeon-woo to deal with Idea. Thus, he succeeded in finding all the records and data left behind by the Martial King. The records and data had been deleted from the Changgong Library once he was annihilated, but the traces left in the Idea did not completely disappear.Of course, that data was corrupted and fragmented all over the place due to his annihilation. Still, Yeon-woo was able to activate his power of omniscience, gather all the information, convert it into data, and plant it all in the Martial King\u2019s illusion. It was the closest version of the Martial King that existed in this time period, as it was created during this time period from the original source.This was a being who thinks \u2018the same\u2019 and acts \u2018the same\u2019. Even he recognized himself as the original \u2018Martial King.It could be understood as the rebirth of thoughts onto a relatively blank canvas. Yeon-woo had come up with the idea after learning how the Martial King pulled out the records of Allforone/Vivasvat, which Vivasvat had left on the twenty-first floor, which was the same mechanism as how Cha Jeong-woo left his Consciousness on the pocket watch.If there was a slight difference, it would be that Cha Jeong-woo\u2019s vestige thought-form existed only in the pocket watch, limiting his movements, while the Martial King was relatively freer.Of course, these new external factors may ultimately cause the Martial King\u2019s demise, so he would have to consider exuviation and transcendence to stop any issues from arising. Once he reached that level, his existence would be more established and firmer.The Martial King never thought that he would become a transcendent in a completely different form, something called a <Star>.\u201cA vestige form\u2026 But if I dig into it, it\u2019s probably not a stable form. It\u2019s not the vestige thoughts that were left from my original existence, but data that was compiled from various sources.\u201dThe Martial King predicted that, even if he achieved transcendence, his existence would be very insecure. In the end, the root of his \u2018existence\u2019 lay in the soul. Without a soul, would he not be just an empty doll? To put it simply, he was essentially a mechanical device created by Yeon-woo.No matter how much effort Yeon-woo had expended in creating his existence, it was bound to be unstable. This was the Martial King\u2019s current state.Regarding this, Yeon-woo had said,\u201cSo, I\u2019m planning on recreating master\u2019s soul.\u201d\u201cMy soul? How do you recreate something that has been annihilated? You\u2019re planning on creating one?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure I can. I\u2019ll try and make a soul as close to the one you possessed originally\u2026 It should essentially be the same.\u201d\u201cBut that wouldn\u2019t be the true me.\u201d\u201cYeah. It would be remarkably similar, but essentially different.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cThe good news is, or at least fortunately\u2026 Master\u2019s soul wasn\u2019t completely annihilated.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026?\u201dAs the Martial King made a puzzled look, Yeon-woo explained in a serious tone of voice.\u201cYour soul wasn\u2019t completely annihilated. It became fragmented into pieces.\u201d\u201cBut that wouldn\u2019t\u2026!\u201d\u201cNo. Your case is different. Your soul obtained the level of emperor, so your soul still exists, albeit in fragments.\u201dUnable to understand Yeon-woo\u2019s explanation, the Martial King tilted his head. He lacked knowledge related to metaphysics, as he had concentrated on martial arts all his life. He was able to follow Yeon-woo\u2019s explanation this far thanks to his deep awareness of the world, but beyond that, it was very unfamiliar territory.However, the Psychic Medium was different. She dealt with metaphysics all her life, and she was a wise philosopher who had peered into the deepest secrets of the world.\u201cYou\u2019re alluding to the division of the worlds through the world line\u2026!\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure when Jeong-woo created it, he wasn\u2019t thinking of this use. Regardless, the divisions are happening even as we speak. Parallel and multiple universes\u2026 there are so many that I can\u2019t even count them.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cIn the parallel and multiple universes, there are probably many different versions of the Martial King.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe Martial King tilted his head with his arms crossed. He was belatedly starting to understand the meaning of \u2018division\u2019. The fragments of his soul, which had attained an emperor level, had been copied within the various other parallel and multiple universes after the implementation of the world line. Hence, pieces of his soul existed in every single iteration of these parallel and multiple universes.\u201cI need to gather all those pieces and unify them together.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf I can do that, though I may not be able to give you the emperor level soul that you attained in the past, I\u2019ll at least be able to give you a soul that is appropriate for your current level.\u201dThe Martial King could not help but laugh. His disciple, Yeon-woo, truly knew how to game the system.Though Yeon-woo was explaining everything as if it could be so simple, how long had he spent trying to find this solution? And how much effort did he expend to check the possibility? The Martial King was grateful toward Yeon-woo, and he also felt a bit sorry. Why was he causing his disciple so much suffering?Fragments\u2026 The Martial King relaxed and muttered softly as he had fallen half-asleep in his chair when Yeon-woo was giving his explanation. The Psychic Medium had taken that opportunity to urgently ask Yeon-woo a question\u2026\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t the essence of those fragments change as the world line divided the universes? Is it really possible to create a whole from all those fragments? Furthermore, do you think they\u2019ll be compatible?\u201dOf course, Yeon-woo was not sure whether his plan would work perfectly.Fragments of a soul left by emperor level being\u2026 Though they were being referred to as fragments, they were probably far larger than any mortal\u2019s soul.Furthermore, it was unclear in what form they would exist. Some may have undergone reincarnation. The fragments possessed such outstanding talents and potential that they would be deemed geniuses from heavens, so they could be active existences. Perhaps one or some of them had already attained exuviation and transcendence, reigning as the singular supreme god in another universe. Some fragments may have turned into disasters, devouring the entire civilization. If the fragments kept evolving, they may even turn into a beast that brings the end of days, terminating whatever universe they were originally located in.They may transform into a weapon and become a divine item, or they may not have an existence at all, scattering throughout the world and becoming a non-living material, like a spirit vein. The fragments may try to become a new emperor level being by mixing with some other transcendent beings, or they may be buried very deep and do nothing.What form would the fragments take? What kind of tendencies would they have? What characteristics would they possess? There was no way to know. The fragments of the soul were, after all, close to a gigantic mass of energy without an ego.The Psychic Medium was alluding to this point.The fragments that undergo such mutations may have completely different appearances and identities from the current Martial King.Would it be possible to have them forfeit their existence to become a part of another Martial King?Was that really possible?Yeon-woo was adamant that he would make it possible. Yeon-woo had already obtained omnipotence.However, the crux of the issue was whether he could properly amalgamate the fragments. Even if they were reinserted into the Martial King, Yeon-woo thought that the fragments, which had already been filled with other thoughts, may actually cause harm to the Martial King\u2019s existence.\u201cThat\u2026!\u201dWhen Yeon-woo was about to say something to reply to the Psychic Medium\u2019s line of questioning, the Martial King suddenly stretched out his hand and interrupted Yeon-woo from speaking.\u201cWife, stop.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve heard all that we need to hear. If we ask any further, we\u2019re questioning the process and the intention of the person bringing us the process.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cMy disciple said he\u2019ll handle it, right? For his beloved master. Shouldn\u2019t I just hang back and see how things go?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s already attained such great things without our help. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll do what\u2019s necessary and figure things out for himself.\u201dYeon-woo looked at the Martial King quietly and bowed his head. Whether the existence sitting in front of him was real or not, for Yeon-woo, the Martial King felt real. The way the Martial King spoke to how he carried himself\u2026this Martial King was still the Martial King.\u300eHusband.\u300fWhile the Martial King was reminiscing about the conversation he had with Yeon-woo at that time, the Psychic Medium called out to him in the present.\u201cYes wife?\u201d\u300eIf you cry again, you know I\u2019ll kill you, right?\u300fFlinch!\u00a0The Martial King unconsciously trembled.The Psychic Medium\u2019s tone was very cold.\u300eYou are my husband, full stop. No one else. You\u2019re the man I chose. No matter what you look like, no matter what form you are, if you can laugh and talk with me like this, you are my husband. Okay?\u300f\u201cUh-huh\u2026\u201d\u300eUgh, you\u2019re acting like Phante, who always needs someone to compliment or comfort him. Are you a kid? Tsk.\u300f\u201cStill\u2026\u201dTo compare him with Phante\u2026\u300eShush.\u300f\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d\u300eIt\u2019s the same as last time. I kept telling you not to do it, but you wouldn\u2019t hear me out. Eventually\u2026\u300fThe Martial King became a deaf mute in front of the nagging words pouring out from the Psychic Medium. He wondered if he had to get up from his bed and get down on his knees as punishment.The Martial King. He was considered one of the strongest in the world of the Tower, and he also served as Yeon-woo\u2019s spiritual supporter. He was the quintessential husband of this age, a person bound to his wife and made infinitely small.***\u201cThen let me ask you another question. What fragments of mine will be in this world line?\u201dWhen Yeon-woo\u2019s explanation was over, the Martial King had asked this question.Yeon-woo replied: \u201cAren\u2019t you here now?\u201dThat answer was enough. Fortunately, he was not just an illusion in this world. That\u2019s what the Martial King thought. \u00a0He\u2026 Nayu\u2026 was breathing and alive in this world.***One chapter in the book ended like this.\u201c\u2026so that\u2019s how it happened.\u201d\u201cRecently, I had a feeling that the world lines were dividing at a faster pace\u2026 I didn\u2019t even consider such an explanation.\u201dCha Jeong-woo nodded as the Heavenly Demon stated his thoughts.The division of the world line, and countless fragments of emperors... This was something neither the Heavenly Demon nor Cha Jeong-woo, who led the division of the world line, had considered at all.No matter how omniscient they may be, unless they focused on these narrow areas and explored them further, it was bound to slip under their radar until they belatedly \u2018noticed\u2019 them.Perhaps Yeon-woo had come up with the idea as he dealt with soul matters throughout the time he spent swimming through the swamp of the abyss/void.\u300eThen, our Emperor Temper, went to seek the fragments of his temper master and must find the temperamental pieces in all these different worlds? All this to recreate his temper master?\u300fWhat the hell was the world going to be like\u2026! Shanon muttered in a quavering voice. Shanon could easily imagine the mass-producing of existences as long as Yeon-woo set his mind to it.The problem was that, in this world, was there anyone who could stop Yeon-woo? Shanon trembled in fear as if the god of disaster had descended.Cha Jeong-woo laughed at Shanon\u2019s exaggerated gestures and said: \u201cThe chapter mentioned that Yeon-woo went to visit our parents first, so let\u2019s start there. I don\u2019t know what happened because I haven\u2019t been on Earth very much these days.\u201dCha Jeong-woo nodded before turning to the next chapter. And then he saw\u2026a blank white page with nothing written on it.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If he didn\u2019t, Yeon-woo would most definitely do something to him. Tigris had swallowed the southern arrow and a piece of the sundial, but he knew he could never reach Yeon-woo\u2019s level.Pride? What use was that if he was dead? Tigris wanted to live, and that was the only thought in his mind. Thus, he spilled every detail he knew to the point of telling his entire life story.At that point, Yeon-woo silently raised a hand. Tigris quickly shut his mouth and simply moved his eyes around.\u00a0Thump, thump!\u00a0Depending on what Yeon-woo did now, the fate of his life would be determined. Sweat dripped down his face.Unaware of Tigris\u2019 anxiousness, Kronos and Rhea were deep in thought. Then, Kronos asked, \u201c\u2026So the stars or whatever are working together to gather the fragments, is that it?\u201dYeon-woo nodded at Kronos\u2019 words. \u201cFor now.\u201d\u201cAnd you were trying to catch them all, but they kept disappearing into the Unreal World so you couldn't.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026We just finished taking care of that Day and Night business, but something else is amiss now.\u201d Kronos shook his head in exhaustion. But after hearing everything, he was sure of one thing. Yeon-woo was going to get busier now. Kronos\u2019 eyes darkened. \u201cSo you\u2019re planning on going to this place called the Unreal World.\u201dYeon-woo nodded and glanced next to him. \u201cI have a guide dog to take me there too.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d Tigris realized what Yeon-woo was talking about and lifted his head with a bright expression. He was relieved he was going to stay alive, but he also paled at the thought of having to be pulled around like this.* * *Yeon-woo tied Tigris as he had with Allforone and stuck him in emptiness. Tigris struggled and resisted, but Yeon-woo paid him no mind.\u201cT-That\u2019s\u2026\u201d Kronos looked into the emptiness without much thought and widened his eyes at what he saw. A face he never thought he\u2019d see again was halfway buried in darkness. It was Allforone, Vivasvat.Kronos, who had been confined in the Tower because of Allforone, couldn\u2019t help but be surprised. However, he soon nodded in understanding.Since Yeon-woo visited the Martial King and rewound the small wheel, he must have naturally met with Allforone. Moreover, Kronos and Yeon-woo had already defeated Allforone once, so Kronos\u2019 resentment of Allforone wasn\u2019t as great as it once was. But of course, that didn\u2019t mean he had any reason to pity him either.\u201cWhy did you stick him in there?\u201d\u201cI had no reason to eliminate it.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cAnd Allforone is also the original of a shadow from the twenty-first floor like the Martial King. But he\u2019s managed to maintain his identity without becoming lost once, so I wanted to take a closer look.\u201dAllforone was definitely too powerful to be a mere shadow. Still, Kronos couldn\u2019t help but feel something was off.Rhea looked at Allforone with concern. She knew all the bad things he\u2019d done to their family, but her heart went out to him after seeing him tied up. A part of her also wondered what the relative of someone so great as the Heavenly Demon could wish for to make a decision as he had.\u201c\u2026Hm?\u201d Rhea tilted her head while examining Allforone\u2019s face.The emptiness swallowed the light that always surrounded Allforone, so his real body was exposed. He looked young, almost babyish. Even younger than Yeon-woo.Yeon-woo and Kronos turned to Rhea.\u201cWhat is it, Mother?\u201d\u201cWhy? Is something wrong?\u201d\u201cThat child\u2026! Wait.\u201d Rhea dug through the documents on a table.Yeon-woo looked at his mother questioningly, but Kronos\u2019 eyes also widened in realization. Kronos said, \u201cThe guy?\u201d\u201cYeah. I thought they looked similar\u2026\u201d Rhea subtly nodded. In Rhea\u2019s hand was a document of Son Jae-won\u2019s profile. At the top right was a photo that closely resembled Allforone.\u201c\u2026Argh.\u201d Just then, Allforone woke up and groaned, slowly lifting his head. His blinking eyes were still unfocused, but that was enough. His face was exactly the same as the picture.\u201cThe last name \u2018Son\u2019\u2026?\u201dSun Wu-kong, who was one of the Heavenly Demon\u2019s more well-known faces, and got along well with the Heavenly Demon, was also a \u201cSon,\u201d wasn\u2019t he? Kronos could be wrong, but his instincts were telling him he was right. A being of his level had instincts that shouldn\u2019t be disregarded. Suddenly, the face of the Band Wheel\u2019s vocal, which had always been foggy in his memory, cleared up to show Son Ji-ho\u2019s face. It was the Heavenly Demon grinning widely!\u201cHuh, huuuuuh?\u201d Kronos paled. Just like how Tigris sweated in fear from Yeon-woo, Kronos was in the same position in front of the Heavenly Demon. \u2018The Heavenly Demon might be seeing this\u2026!\u2019It wasn\u2019t strange at all for the Heavenly Demon to make a fuss for not recognizing him. Kronos quickly racked his brain thinking of what he could do. His gaze landed on Allforone, who had regained his consciousness.\u201c\u2026What do you plan on doing with me?\u201d Allforone\u2019s deep eyes looked at Yeon-woo. His voice was low and emotionless as if he had given up on resisting and was awaiting his sentence.However, Yeon-woo knew different. The guy was searching for the next opportunity to leave this place. \u2018That\u2019s what I would do.\u2019 He and Allforone were different but also similar in more ways than one.Instead of answering Allforone\u2019s question, he turned to Rhea. \u201cMother, why were you searching for him?\u201d Yeon-woo had absorbed Allforone in the Tower, so he had some of his memories. He knew Allforone was also from Earth like the Heavenly Demon, and his real name was Son Jae-won.\u201cHe\u2019s the child Chae-young was looking for.\u201d\u201cThat girl earlier?\u201d Yeon-woo felt something click and sent a message to Sesha upstairs.\u300eCan you bring that girl named Min Chae-young down here?\u300f\u300eChae-young? Is something the matter?\u300f\u300eNot exactly.\u300f\u300eUhhhh\u2026\u300f\u300eWhat is it? Did something happen?\u300fYeon-woo felt Sesha was hesitant to bring Min Chae-young down.\u300e\u2026Well, the thing is, I think Chae-young is uncomfortable around you.\u300f\u300eI see. It must be because her senses are delicate, so don\u2019t worry about that. I have something to show her.\u300f\u300eGot it. Okay.\u300fThere was a noise upstairs and Sesha soon brought Min Chae-young to the first floor.\u300cHuh\u2026?\u300d\u201cAre you\u2026?\u201dThe slightly scared Min Chae-young and the exhausted Allforone met eyes. The two stood there shocked and speechless.* * *Yeon-woo didn\u2019t know exactly how the laws of causality worked, even though he had become the Black King, who was the universe itself. They were laws that his brother managed, so he didn't know exactly the mechanisms behind them.No, well technically, Yeon-woo did know. But he didn\u2019t know if the results known as \u201ccoincidence\u201d or \u201cfate\u201d were natural, or if they were a consequence of someone\u2019s joke. If not that, maybe they really were events that happened with less than a thousandth of a thousandth percent chance. However, Yeon-woo was certain that Cha Jeong-woo probably didn\u2019t know either.\u2018Allforone/Son Jae-won and Min Chae-young\u2019s reunion\u2026 Can this really simply be coincidence or fate?\u2019 After recalling a part of Son Jae-won\u2019s memory that he\u2019d buried in a deep part of his mind, Yeon-woo belatedly remembered Min Chae-young was a very precious part of it.Maybe this was the butterfly effect. The godly being, Son Jae-won, subconsciously longed for Min Chae-young, and that had influenced the laws of causality for the star fragment to reach her. Or maybe it was the other way around. Min Chae-young obtained the star fragment, and she had wished to see Son Jae-won, so they had ended up meeting like this through Yeon-woo, who rewound the wheel. Whatever it was, the two were blind to others\u2019 gazes and just stared at each other.Yeon-woo let Allforone free from all the binds he was in. He had already retrieved most of Allforone\u2019s power anyway, and he had a strong feeling Allforone wouldn\u2019t create a scene in front of Min Chae-young. Even if he was wrong, he was confident he could easily take care of it.Yeon-woo, Kronos, Rhea, and Sesha left so the two could have some time to themselves.\u201cHuh\u2026! That inhumane bastard in love?\u201d Kronos snorted in disbelief. The Allforone he remembered was a sage who\u2019d lost all humanity and only sought justice. \u2018Sage is just a nice way of putting it. He was practically a robot of justice. Ugh.\u2019It was strange seeing such a guy showing a humane side. But with this, Kronos could no longer resent Allforone. The way Allforone had been reunited with his old lover, and the longing for his lover that death couldn\u2019t rid him of\u2026reminded Kronos of how he\u2019d been born again hundreds and thousands of times for the chance to see Rhea just once more, as well of how Rhea decided to leave the heavenly world for him.Rhea looked adoringly at Min Chae-young, who was crying tears of happiness and nodded.\u201cI will rewind the wheel now.\u201d Yeon-woo gripped the air. Time was of no matter to them, so they could arrange a meeting for the wedding once both sides were prepared.Clank![Will you rewind the wheel?]Creak!\u00a0The wheel began to spin.\u201cBut can I really go?\u201d Sesha carefully asked. Her departure was decided rather suddenly.Rhea smiled warmly and stroked her granddaughter\u2019s head. \u201cYou said you wanted to see Edora unnie, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not unnie anymore, she\u2019s my aunt! Heehee. Yes. I really do want to see her again.\u201dAs Sesha had told Min Chae-young, Edora had stayed with Sesha as a good memory. She was pretty, kind, and confident. If someone asked Sesha who she wanted to be like, she would immediately state Edora as her role model.While the scenery around them rapidly changed, Yeon-woo suddenly remembered something and spoke up. \u201c\u2026If you happen to see something strange upon arriving at the village, don\u2019t be too surprised.\u201d\u201cSomething strange? It takes a lot to surprise me. You know, you tend to underestimate the lives your mom and dad have lived.\u201d Kronos had experienced all kinds of things during his long life. He spoke with assurance, but Yeon-woo still looked unsure. Then, when the wheel was done spinning, Kronos understood why Yeon-woo had been concerned.\u201cHuh\u2026? What\u2019s that\u2026?\u201dRhea and Sesha also widened their eyes in surprise. In the middle of the One-horned tribe\u2019s village was a statue of Yeon-woo and Edora.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe three were speechless for a while.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This side of you might be genetic too.\u201d Rhea was the first to break the silence. She covered her mouth as she chuckled, looking at Kronos for some reason.Kronos turned away as if trying to avoid his wife\u2019s gaze. Yeon-woo became suspicious, speaking up, \u201cDid you\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026No. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything yet.\u201d\u201cYou were about to.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYou punk\u2026!\u201dAs Kronos frowned, Yeon-woo slowly crept behind Rhea. \u201cMother.\u201d\u201cHahaha. Actually, when your father was younger\u2014\u201d\u201cAhhh! No! Don\u2019t tell him!\u201d\u201cHe had such a big head. So he\u2026\u201d\u201cAhhhhh! Can\u2019t hear you!\u201d Kronos jumped around, trying to stop Rhea, but of course it didn\u2019t work.* * *Another rumor soon spread throughout the village.\u201cDid you hear?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cCain brought his parents.\u201d\u201cOh? Oooooooh! Ooh!\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s not just one or two people who have seen this.\u201dThere was a rumor that Yeon-woo had appeared in the middle of the village with his parents and niece in tow and went to where the Martial King resided. It was definitely not just a silly rumor to gloss over. The current hottest button issue in the village was of Yeon-woo and Edora\u2019s marriage. No tribe member was going to miss out on this big news.\u201cLet\u2019s go see!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s watch!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s goooooo!\u201dAnd like that, the Martial King\u2019s residence was filled with countless members of the tribe. Each of them had mischievous smiles, and they didn\u2019t hide the reason why they were there.\u201cYou know\u2026 I heard this is the first time our princess is meeting her in-laws.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201d\u201cYeah. Cain\u2019s family had some stuff going on. It\u2019s because of that.\u201d\u201cHer father-in-law is Kronos, and her mother-in-law is Rhea. Then it\u2019s understandable. Regardless\u2026it\u2019s going to be amusing.\u201d\u201cRight? Hehehe.\u201dWould the aloof Edora be shy in front of the in-laws she was meeting for the first time, or would she be the same? It was a very amusing subject for the tribe. And that wasn\u2019t all of it.\u201cBut I\u2019m also curious about that.\u201d\u201cOoh! Is there another topic to be interested in?\u201d\u201cYou know. Cain always acts up and talks back to our king, but he\u2019d do anything the princess wants.\u201d\u201cYeah. He had trouble bringing up the wedding too.\u201d\u201cHow do you think the first meeting between the families is gonna go?\u201d\u201cA nervous Cain\u2026 I can\u2019t imagine.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why we should go and watch!\u201dThe members of the tribe all agreed.Bustle! Clamor!\u00a0The Martial King\u2019s residence was chaotic because of the people who were trying to peek inside. A few of them even attempted to use their martial arts to sneak inside, but it was impossible to enter because of a barrier.\u201cWow, he made a barrier like this just by projecting his personal defense art. He really is a monster.\u201dThe tribe members were astonished at how strong the barrier was, but they still attempted to find its weakness. The One-horned tribe consisted of people who were united with their challenging and adventurous spirits anyway. Having a barrier like this would only encourage their competitive side.\u201cOur martial arts to sneak inside won\u2019t work! What should we do?\u201d\u201cShould we just break it down?\u201d\u201cHow? That inhumane monster even transcended this time!\u201d\u201cShould I use sword energy?\u201d\u201cYeah! It won\u2019t hurt to try. We\u2019re going to die from frustration at this rate!\u201dThere were a few tribe members attempting to break the barrier with brute strength.\u00a0Pow, pow, pow! Du du du.\u00a0But of course, when they did, opposing energy was created and they were flung back with an impact that was multiple times stronger than what they had inflicted.\u201cOwwww\u2026!\u201d\u201cKegh!\u201d\u201cAs expected\u2026this isn\u2019t easy!\u201d\u201cStill!\u201d\u201cNothing can stop me!\u201d\u201cLike always, I\u2019ll find a way to climb over this obstacle! Hiya!\u201dThe tribe members spoke like they were mercenaries trying to invade a demon king\u2019s castle, and crashed against the barrier. A few of them spoke victoriously of how they managed to last a few seconds longer or leave a minuscule crack.The competition among the tribe members pulled them to the Martial King\u2019s residence like a magnet, and the barrier was like a great mountain that had to be overcome.\u201c\u2026They\u2019re all idiots.\u201d The Head Elder shook his head in disbelief as he watched. Old and young people alike were wasting time on such a futile act.Was this tribe really going to be okay? The Head Elder genuinely was concerned about the tribe\u2019s future. \u201c\u2026\u201d But of course, the greater concern was inside of the barrier.* * *Thump. Boom.\u00a0No matter how many layers were combined to create the barrier, it was impossible to completely eliminate the minor noise without using magic. Faint shaking could be easily felt by beings like the Martial King and Kronos. Moreover, the tribe members seemed to be making a new attempt because the quaking was becoming worse. It appeared they\u2019d found some method.The Martial King was incredulous of his own tribe. \u201cHahaha. They\u2019re quite loud, aren\u2019t they? I hope you understand. They tend to be really noisy\u2026\u201dKronos lightly waved his hand from where he was sitting opposite the chuckling Martial King. \u201cIt\u2019s better they\u2019re active than staying silent. And I\u2019m used to atmospheres like this.\u201dKronos took a liking to the One-horned tribe. It reminded him of Olympus from when he was younger. Back during Uranus\u2019 rule, when it hadn\u2019t been that long since all the forces were united, there was never a silent day. There was never a civil war thanks to Uranus, but small conflicts often occurred. Uranus used this in a positive way to raise Olympus\u2019 morale.The reasons might be different, but Olympus and the One-horned tribe were similar. Hot-blooded tribe members, a competitive atmosphere, and a free-spirited society\u2026 Kronos liked it all. If Rhea and Yeon-woo weren\u2019t here, he\u2019d forget about acting polite and go hang out with the tribe members.\u2018This guy seems to have become different too.\u2019 Kronos felt the competitive spirit sleeping inside of him slowly waking up. He still remembered the man who didn\u2019t even blink in front of the armies of Asgard and defeated them all with a laugh. As a fellow martial artist, he naturally felt respect. Of course, the Martial King here was more a vestige than the real Martial King, but he still seemed like the Martial King to Kronos\u2019 eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s a celebratory day. Would you like a drink?\u201d\u201cOoh, do you have nice liquor?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s some I\u2019ve been saving for days like this. Hehehe.\u201d\u201cIs that\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou have a good eye, in-law. Yes. It\u2019s monkey wine.\u201d\u201cHuh! Such a precious drink\u2026!\u201dPop!\u00a0The moment the bottle was opened, a thick fruity scent was released. The Martial King smiled confidently, and Kronos swallowed. The two began to engage in animated conversation, and Rhea and the Psychic Medium sat politely and spoke of their children\u2019s marriage.\u201cWhen should the wedding be?\u201d\u201cAn auspicious day would be suitable.\u201d\u201cWhat days are auspicious for the One-horned tribe?\u201dThey spoke of setting the date, the newlywed house, the dowry and jewelry\u2026 Yeon-woo and Edora had a hard time keeping up. Since it was both their first time getting married, they had to leave everything to their parents. To be exact, their mothers would be taking care of everything.In fact, Yeon-woo and Edora just wanted to have a simple wedding, but since this was also a union of Olympus and the One-horned tribe, they couldn\u2019t gloss over this large event.\u201cYou raised such a beautiful daughter. How is she so pretty and kind?\u201d When the conversation was about wrapped up, Rhea looked at Edora with warm eyes. She looked like she adored her future daughter-in-law. Rhea had already given her silently permission to marry the moment she saw Edora politely greet them immediately after they entered the village.Of course, since Yeon-woo said he liked Edora, Rhea didn\u2019t have any intention of suggesting against it even if she wasn\u2019t satisfied. However, it was clear how kind Edora was and how well she was raised from her attitude to the adults, so Rhea was able to continue the wedding planning more delightedly than expected.But every time Rhea looked at Edora, Edora looked down.Thump, thump, thump!\u00a0The previous day, Edora had been determined to be warm and polite to her in-laws, no matter how nervous she was. It had been going fine when she met them, but the moment they sat down, everything in her head flew away.\u2018\u2026What should I do?\u2019 Edora thanked them, but it was difficult to say anything else. She questioned whether or not what she said might be offensive to her in-laws, and she repeated everything in her head multiple times so as not to say anything that tarnished the reputation of her parents. She was tense from nervousness. \u2018But\u2026Oraboni doesn\u2019t seem affected in the slightest.\u2019Yeon-woo was sitting with a composed face. He didn\u2019t jump into the conversation so as not to get in the way of the parents\u2019 discussions, but every time the atmosphere became awkward, he brought up an appropriate conversation starter to make the talks flow naturally.\u2018He\u2019s amazing.\u2019He didn\u2019t appear nervous at all. Before today, he had seemed anxious, but did he feel more at ease now that they were doing the real thing? Edora nodded, thinking of how like Yeon-woo that was.\u2018Huh\u2026?\u2019 But then Edora saw how Yeon-woo\u2019s hand was trembling slightly. The water in his cup was faintly rippling. He just seemed normal on the outside, but he was actually more nervous than her. Edora grinned, thinking him adorable for trying not to show his anxiety. Thanks to him, Edora felt less nervous, and she joined their conversation more comfortably.Yeon-woo\u2019s hand continued to tremble until the end.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He should\u2019ve stepped up to help the awkward atmosphere flow naturally, but Edora had taken care of everything. He hoped she wouldn\u2019t be disappointed in him after this\u2026Just then, a hand touched his shoulder, and Yeon-woo turned around. Edora was grinning at him, and she said, \u201cGood job, oraboni.\u201d\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? If you weren\u2019t here, it really would\u2019ve been awkward. Good job.\u201d Yeon-woo almost teared up from the way Edora was trying to cheer him up. It continually occurred to him that he\u2019d made a brilliant choice with this marriage.\u201cOh, my!\u201d Yeon-woo couldn\u2019t stop himself from pulling Edora to him because of how beautiful she was. Edora slapped Yeon-woo in surprise, but she didn\u2019t try to escape his embrace. Rather, she patted Yeon-woo\u2019s back with his slender hand. \u201cI wonder when our oraboni became such a softie? You turn into more of a baby every day.\u201dPat, pat.\u00a0At her soothing warm touch, Yeon-woo\u2019s tense muscles began to relax.\u2018He really does need me,\u2019 Edora thought to herself. At the same time, she found it adorable that Yeon-woo only showed this side of him to her, and she smiled widely.Just then, Edora discovered a wide smile like her own was looking at them. No, it was more of a devilish grin than a smile\u2026!Snicker!Edora had no idea when he had appeared, but the Martial King was watching them with an amused gaze from where he was leaning on the doorframe with his arms crossed. Edora felt chills run down her spine from how mischievous he looked.\u201cWhat\u2026is it?\u201d Feeling Edora\u2019s body stiffen, Yeon-woo raised his head from Edora\u2019s chest. The Martial King was using his powers to the best of his ability to hide, and Yeon-woo hadn\u2019t been able to feel him because of how taxed his nervousness.The Martial King silently mouthed words at a flushed Edora.\u00a0Oraboni.\u2665 Hee hee.\u2661\u00a0Somehow, he even managed to mouth a heart.Edora\u2019s face turned redder. \u2018I-I\u2019m going to kill hiiiiiiim!\u2019 Now, her face was on the verge of exploding.Tremble, tremble!\u201cEdora?\u201d Yeon-woo began to turn his head at the strange feeling.\u201cYou idiot, you\u2019re at it again.\u201d\u201cHm? Hmmmmm? Wife? Why don\u2019t we talk after you let go of this\u2026?! Ahhhhh!\u201dThe Psychic Medium suddenly appeared and pulled the Martial King into the hallway by his ear.Yeon-woo realized his teacher had seen the position he and Edora were in, and his face slightly turned red. \u201c\u2026We\u2019re gonna be teased anyway.\u201d But then he changed his mind. \u201cLet\u2019s stay like this a while longer.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dYeon-woo and Edora held each other tight again.* * *\u201cExtra, extra, read all about it!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a wedding! A wedding!\u201d\u201cCain and Princess Edora are getting married!\u201d\u201cKyahahahaha! You know, back in my days, I sparred against Cain\u2026!\u201dThe wedding date was set! As the news spread, the village turned into chaos\u2026 It was pandemonium\u2026before becoming a shitshow. The tribe members began to run around busily at the good news. They spread the news to their acquaintances or clans they were close with. To the clans involved, they sent extravagantly decorated invitations.The invitation was filled with flowery words and messages, but their contents could be reduced to two main points.\u2015Don\u2019t come empty-handed.\u2015Bring good presents.There was a subtle threat that the guests should congratulate the couple properly\u00a0or else.\u00a0It was understandable, however, because of the importance of this marriage. The groom, Cain, was the Martial King\u2019s disciple and the current strongest being in the Tower. The bride, Edora, was the child of the Martial King and the Psychic Medium, and she was designated to become the next Psychic Medium.In the village, the Psychic Medium\u2019s status was equal to the Martial King\u2019s. At times, she was even more important. This event was no simple event indeed.But of course, there were many people who were not happy with their marriage, especially the groups that were on bad terms with Arthia.* * *\u201c\u2026It\u2019s clear they\u2019re mocking us.\u201dOnce upon a time, the Devil Army sought the Heavenly Demon\u2019s attention and love, but they had grown frustrated with him and changed the god they served.The Head Bishop, who was catching his breath in the magic region, smiled wryly at the invitation his subordinate brought him. The court dress he used to wear was gone, and he was wearing frayed clothes that a farmer might wear. It was hard to think he was the Head Bishop of the Devil Army. Moreover, the aura and fierceness he used to exude were missing as well. His pupils that were dark with demonic energy and chaotic energy had turned clear like glass.A magic region was a world that was darker than an abyss and nastier than hell. However, the magic region Hughl and the followers of the Devil Army arrived at was nothing like any other magic region.The sun rose in the morning, and it set at night. The soil was very arable, crops grew as they were planted, and the flowing river was so clear that fish swam in them. There weren\u2019t any societies or civilizations, so there was no need for them to fight or compete with others. Even if one wanted to do something evil, their resolve would be weakened after feeling the warm sun and breezy wind.The Devil Army repeatedly lived through battles and chaos, but everything they could ever wish for was here. A few of the bishops said this place shouldn\u2019t be called a magic region, but \u201cheaven\u201d or \u201cparadise.\u201dHowever, the owner of this region, the Bull Demon King, denied it. He always said the same thing.\u00a0This land, this world. It\u2019s a place where those abandoned by the world have come to with their last hopes. What better word to describe this place than magic region?It was a magic region because those abandoned by the world had come here. Those living in this magic region called where they currently lived the Northern Magic Temple.Hughl appreciated these words very much. He felt what the Bull Demon King said aptly described him and the followers. Perhaps they were the most suited for this magic region, since magic and devil could mean the same thing. They were able to find the peace they had wanted in this place.Of course, they had found peace, but that didn\u2019t mean they were cut off from news from the outside. Peace was also a pause between war and chaos. To continue to have peace, one needed to be stronger than all others, and they had to be sensitive to everything that was happening in the world\u2026 Hughl was aware of this. He didn\u2019t have to look far to find an example.The One-horned tribe declared themselves separated from the world, but they were able to keep their high status due to their strength. So most of the bishops acted as spies outside of the magic region, and they delivered necessary news. The problem was that this time, the One-horned tribe had delivered the news themselves.\u201c\u2026They personally gave the invitation to our best-hidden spy.\u201d Hughl flipped the invitation in his hand and smiled bitterly. The Devil Army had evaded persecution and hid in the deepest crevices of the world, but the One-horned tribe approached them easily. He knew they had the Psychic Medium, but he wondered \u00a0just how far their eyes did reach.\u201cSecond bishop. What do you think of this?\u201d Hughl wanted to know what Kindred thought. Considering how much the Devil Army had suffered because of Yeon-woo, this invitation should never have come here. However, there was no one in the Devil Army who had the worst relationship with Yeon-woo than Kindred.Hughl guessed that Kindred probably was displeased. Or he might postpone his response and tell him to ask the Bull Demon King or any of the other Demon Kings.\u201c\u2026I think we should go.\u201dKindred\u2019s answer was unexpected. Hughl raised an eyebrow, asking, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI believe we should separate work and personal matters.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s work, and what\u2019s personal?\u201d\u201cWork is how strong the One-horned tribe is, and the personal matter is our bad relationship with Yeon-woo.\u201cYou\u2019re saying there\u2019s no need to distance ourselves from strong people?\u201d\u201cI am aware there are many rumors and assumptions about our clan in the Tower. But if we appear at the event\u2026\u201d\u201cWe can show them the Devil Army is still powerful. No, we can show them we\u2019re even better off. Good thinking.\u201d\u201cIt was nothing.\u201d\u201cNo. I was having very mixed feelings, but you helped me to organize my thoughts.\u201d Hughl folded his hands behind his back and lifted his head. After he arrived at the magic region, he had more opportunities to look up at the sky like this. When he watched the moving white clouds, he thought of many things. This was also a blessing of such a lax lifestyle.\u201c\u2026We still have a long way to go to speak about returning to our glory days. But taking a break isn\u2019t bad.\u201d Hughl muttered to himself and turned around. \u201cI must meet with the Bull Demon King. Tell him I wish to make an appointment.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dHughl\u2019s eyes flashed as he watched Kindred disappear with a swish.\u201cThe clouds above continue to move like any other day\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Maybe it\u2019s because there have been many changes in my life since then.I\u2019ve lived in the countryside my whole life, but I moved to Seoul, got an office with my friends, wrote stories, and started a business. I met my partner in life and got married, and I went from my late twenties to my thirties.I also received so much love to the extent I wondered if I would ever be received like this again. Thank you, readers, once more.When I planned Second Life Ranker, the theme was \u201cfamily love\u201d (it\u2019s not how bad-tempered Yeon-woo is T_T). The main character who\u2019s kept his heart closed off his entire life uncovers a secret related to his brother\u2019s death, and he makes many new relationships in the process of revenge\u2026 That was the main plot. I wanted to go in detail about how he finds his dispersed family and his heart is mended.However, the story became longer than expected. There were some sections that were dragged out and episodes I wasn\u2019t able to express properly. I most regret not delving deeply into Allforone\u2019s past. That aside, I tried many things and attempted to make the story amusing and interesting for everyone. I hope this could be felt through my writing.With this, Second Life Ranker has finally come to the end of its journey over four years and ninety-nine arcs. Still, I plan on continuing to write, and Yeon-woo\u2019s story will go on for some time. The uncompleted transcendence, secret of the 8th-step Awakening, R'lyeh asleep on Earth, plot of the world points and world lines, Hou Yi\u2019s purpose, Agares\u2019 past\u2026 I intend on slowly unfolding these events.I am preparing side stories along with my next novel. I cannot give you any determined date, but I can say it\u2019ll be coming soon. Also, some of you may have caught on already, but my next novel will share the same world as Second Life Ranker and my other novels.Like my previous works, I planned it so you can enjoy it without having read any of the other novels\u2014or if you\u2019ve read my other works, it\u2019ll be even more entertaining. Please continue to send your love and support in the future.The weather has started to become hotter again. Please take care, and I\u2019ll return when the heat has subsided.With much thanks,\u671f\u9053?\u7de3 (Sadoyeon)If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Second Life RankerCH ss - 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySide Story Chapter 26 - Sesha (1)At this moment, the person who had the most mixed feelings was probably Nocturne, who now knew his identity. \u2018My teacher\u2019s\u2026shadow.\u2019Nocturne wasn\u2019t a shadow from the twenty-first floor but a real being. However, he still identified as Nocturne, and not Son Jae-won/Vivasvat. The memories and emotions he\u2019d experienced until now left too strong an impression on him. Thus, he could understand how the Martial King was feeling inside right now.The Martial King was probably despairing and wanted to give up on everything. He might want to flip everything over. Perhaps he was angry that all his emotions and memories were false. He couldn\u2019t die even if he wanted to, nor was he able to be angry. He needed someone to let out his anger on, but after that was done, all that awaited him was emptiness\u2026And Nocturne knew this all too well. Still, his teacher was able to endure this because he was the Martial King. Nocturne and the Martial King were on entirely different levels.\u201c\u2026\u201d Nocturne silently closed his eyes. He wanted to descend to where the Martial King was and ask if he was okay. He used to admire the Martial King, and he also resented and despised him. But right now, he just wanted to stay by the Martial King\u2019s side. However, the reason why he wasn\u2019t able to do so\u2026\u2018It\u2019s because I still lack the courage.\u2019Nocturne\u2019s father, the Heavenly Demon, said misunderstandings and hurt feelings should be resolved instead of being kept tucked away. People who believed they would be solved and forgotten over time were fools, and these feelings could unknowingly build up inside of you and suddenly explode. It was important to clear any misunderstandings, and for that, one needed to have a conversation face to face and listen to what the other was thinking. Only then would there be no regret.Nocturne knew what he had to do, but he found it difficult to step up to the task. He was hesitant because he thought it might make his teacher more upset if he showed up now. All kinds of thoughts swept through his mind. \u2018\u2026I suppose I should still go.\u2019 He needed to go talk to the Martial King. If he kept postponing it, there would be nothing left in the end.Nocturne slowly stood up, and everyone turned to look at him. They had all been wondering what to do after seeing the blank white page, and they tilted their heads in confusion, not understanding what Nocturne was doing.The Heavenly Demon smiled faintly, as if he was the only one to know. \u201cHave you decided?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon\u2019s smile deepened. He looked proud of his son. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown up.\u201dNocturne thanked the Heavenly Demon with a bow and left. The moment he stepped forward, a portal opened and swallowed him up.Cha Jeong-woo and Shanon didn\u2019t know what had happened between the father and son, but they could tell some of the awkwardness in their relationship had eased and that they had become closer. The two who were traveling along parallel lines that couldn\u2019t overlap had finally changed directions to meet.Jeong-woo didn\u2019t ask what happened between them. It was enough that the distrust between the two had disappeared, and he knew the situation with the Martial King brought about their reconciliation. What happened between the father and son was between them, so Jeong-woo left their business to them and focused on Yeon-woo\u2019s life again. If Yeon-woo had gone to collect these fragments of stars, was it necessary for him to leave without a word to him or the Heavenly Demon?\u2018Wouldn\u2019t it have been easier to collect the fragments with my help?\u2019Jeong-woo was called \u201cMaster of All Laws\u201d across multiple world lines. As Deus Ex Machina, he was the god of the wheel that ruled and controlled over everything, and he was a manifestation of the laws of causality. Just with his mere will, he could probably gather the scattered pieces of the Martial King. There must\u2019ve been a reason why Yeon-woo had to hide it.\u2018Where do I start?\u2019There were no books that had records of Yeon-woo, the Black King\u2019s will and conscious. That meant Yeon-woo cut off his connection with his real body so there would be no traces of his whereabouts. He had gone independent.Of course, if Yeon-woo wished, he could recover the connection to his real body. The problem was that when he was disconnected, he was pretty much without his omniscience and omnipotence, so it would be dangerous if something happened.Wondering about the possible reason and if something bad had actually happened, Jeong-woo couldn\u2019t help but feel anxious.\u2018Well\u2026 He did say he was going to speak to our parents.\u2019Jeong-woo was about to look into Kronos and Rhea\u2019s conversation with Yeon-woo but realized they might not have realized what he was up to. Their gazes when looking at their son was probably only filled with love. He needed a third party, someone who was very close to Yeon-woo, and there was a particular someone that came to mind\u2026\u2018Sesha.\u2019 But Jeong-woo wondered if he could take a peek at Sesha\u2019s records, because it would be like sneaking a look at his daughter\u2019s hidden diary. He was hesitant. It wasn\u2019t like he could look at his daughter\u2019s private life with the Heavenly Demon and Shanon.\u2018I have no choice.\u2019Unfortunately, Jeong-woo truly had no other choice. He would just close the book after skimming to see if there was anything about Yeon-woo. And he would never speak of what he saw. If his daughter had a boyfriend?\u2018I\u2019ll just have to kill him.\u2019 Cha Jeong-woo\u2019s eyes glinted dangerously.[Would you like to attempt another search?]Gulp!\u00a0Jeong-woo swallowed and extended his hand in the air.* * *B-Beep! Beep, beep!\u00a0An alarm blared, screaming at Sesha to wake up.\u201cUghhh\u2026\u201d Sesha, who was wearing pajamas with adorable bears and a pink bunny sleeping mask, groaned. She didn\u2019t want to wake up. That was the only thought in her mind.This was an event that took place every morning, so Sesha wondered why she couldn\u2019t just get used to it. To her, school was a prison that kept in students who needed to be free! This was a conspiracy created by society so that they could create dull human beings who would be slaves! She wanted to shout these statements at the top of her lungs.\u300cHohohu! Instead of thinking such peculiar things, don\u2019t you think it would be best to wake up and stretch? Like me, huhu.\u300d\u2018You don\u2019t sleep!\u2019\u300cNah, of course not! I try to sleep at least eight hours a day. The secret to my flawless skin is sleep.\u300d\u2018I\u2019m not curious about the skin of a perverted skinhead who likes bunny girl hats!\u2019\u300cAw. Our little miss Sesha is being shy again.\u300d\u2018I\u2019m not!\u2019Sesha wanted to tell Laplace, the creature who kept on blabbering nonsense in her shadows, to shut up. But Laplace didn\u2019t even pretend to listen to her. He just continued to speak gibberish 24/7. She was going to go crazy because of him.\u2018I want to sleep for just five more minutes but you always wake me up!\u2019\u201cCha So-young!\u201d Just then, the door burst open with a shout. It was Ananta, wearing an apron while holding a ladle in her right hand. \u201cGet up! You need to eat before going to school!\u201dSesha brought her blankets over her head. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna eat\u2026 So just ten more minutes\u2026 No, just five more\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? You\u2019re not going to have enough strength if you don\u2019t eat. How are you going to study?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, so\u2014\u201d\u201cThe soup\u2019s going to get cold! Hurry and get up!\u201d\u201cArrrgh! I don\u2019t want toooooooooo!\u201d Sesha showed no indication of getting up. She was seventeen this year, an adolescent who didn\u2019t listen to her parents.The problem was that Ananta was just as fiery as Sesha. Displeased, an eyebrow twitched on Ananta\u2019s face. \u201cGet up this instant.\u201d\u201cUgh, whatever! Whatever, whatever.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Laplace!\u201d\u300cYes, ma\u2019am! I\u2019ve been waiting for you to say that!\u300dSuddenly, Sesha\u2019s shadow expanded and something large popped out. It was a man who was at least two meters tall with very bulky and burdensome-to-see muscles. His shirt was who-knew-where, and his chest muscles heaved shinly. On his smooth head were his trademark bunny ears.\u300cThe cute and adorable bunny is hereeeeeee!\u300dLaplace lifted Sesha, blankets and all, as if it was a familiar routine.\u201cAhhhhhhh! Let me go, you perverted bunny!\u201d\u300cOooh! Very good. Please continue to insult me like that. Haa, haa.\u300dNo matter how much Sesha kicked and struggled, Laplace didn\u2019t even blink. In this household, Ananta was higher on the hierarchy than Jeong-woo, so it was obvious who Laplace needed to obey. Laplace forced the blankets away from Sesha and pushed her into the bathroom. Even the sleepiest of people would have woken up by now.\u201cUgh!\u201d Sesha glowered at Laplace.\u300cHohohu. I love it. Very good. Please continue to despise me like that.\u300d\u201c\u2026!\u201dHowever, Laplace was a step above Sesha.* * *After Yeon-woo took care of all the dungeons, society returned to before the \u201cday of the beginning.\u201d Of course, it wasn\u2019t a complete recovery. It wasn\u2019t possible to return the developed society back to normal in the span of a day.However, society continued to move forward, and Sesha turned seventeen and entered high school. As one of the most powerful players, she was so famous that she was called a celebrity, but she wanted to live normally like the other children her age. And her wishes\u2026quickly turned to regret not a month after she started school.\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have said I\u2019m going to school.\u2019 Sesha thought to herself with a petulant expression as she chewed her food. \u2018Who knew you had to get up so early?!\u2019Sesha didn\u2019t used to have trouble waking up early when she was a player. It was strange. But because she had aged, her stamina wasn\u2019t like before, and she disliked the strict rules enforced by school. School life was definitely enjoyable. She liked learning things she didn\u2019t know, and she had a lot of friends. But she could never get used to this battle in the mornings\u2026 If only she could sleep a little more. And her mom was too much, forcing her to eat breakfast before sending her off.\u201cThank you for the meal.\u201d Sesha set her chopsticks down and stood up, hoisting her backpack on her shoulder.Ananta looked down at the table and frantically chased after Sesha, putting down the dishes she was doing. Sesha\u2019s soup was nearly untouched, and she\u2019d only had a few spoonfuls of rice. \u201cWhy are you getting up already? You should eat more.\u201d\u201cWhatever. I don\u2019t feel like it.\u201dBam!\u00a0Sesha slammed the door as she left. It was a small rebellion for forcing her to get up.Ananta sighed, left alone at the door. \u201cWho does she take after?\u201d She was thankful her weak daughter had grown up to be healthy, but she was sad about Sesha becoming more fiery-tempered by the day.* * *\u201cGrandpaaaaa!\u201d\u201cOh my! Why is our little princess so angry?\u201dKronos always drove Sesha to school because their house was located in a quiet place slightly farther away from Seoul.Kronos greeted his adorable granddaughter with a smile and chuckled at her pouting lips. He knew his granddaughter was upset and wanted to vent to him about fighting with her mom. He could tell just from the way she spoke.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A devastating scene was revealed after the dust cloud settled down.\u201cThe heck?!\u201d\u201cHe can explode a god\u2026?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s gonna be another explosion! Watch out!\u201dThe problem was that it didn\u2019t stop there. The archangels and demon kings who barely managed to escape from the explosion frantically scattered at the consecutive bursts of light.\u00a0Crash! Crash! Crash! Boom! Rumble!\u00a0The gods of light were all bathed in light, causing continuous explosions.\u201cAhhhh!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your body?!\u201d\u201cH-Huh\u2026? What\u2019s wrong with me?!\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201d\u201cD-Don\u2019t run away! Save me before you leave! P-Please\u2026! Ahhhh!\u201dThe onlookers and the invited guests all escaped the palace. The archangels and demon kings who were fighting against Asgard and those on bad relations with Yeon-woo all left. The same went with the One-horned tribe.While on the run, the guests suspected each other. A few in the group had suddenly exploded like the gods of Asgard. As a result, the damage that was done couldn\u2019t be put in words. It was an utter mess. Everyone doubted each other, and it was a pandemonium where no one was able to bless Yeon-woo\u2019s marriage.\u201cPahaha! How is this? I took special care in preparing this for you, who\u2019s called the father of all worlds!\u201d Leo sounded like he was having the time of his life. From what he had investigated, Yeon-woo was very weak toward those he loved.From when he was a human, Yeon-woo took up the sword for his brother\u2019s revenge, and he even traveled down the path to becoming the Black King to save his family. At the end of all his unprecedented actions were his family and friends\u2026 That meant he was going to be the most sensitive to the harm done to his acquaintances. Leo had no way of knowing, but Yeon-woo\u2019s heart was probably being crushed.Leo was aiming for a time when Yeon-woo would be unsettled. Then, Yeon-woo would finally show his weakness. If the channel that connected the Black King\u2019s manifestation and his true body was shaken turbulently, Leo would be able to see it. At that moment, he would tear into the channel and climb up to beat up the Black King\u2019s true body.Yeon-woo scanned his surroundings. There was no emotion in his eyes as he looked around himself. Leo thought Yeon-woo was just acting tough, but Yeon-woo then asked, \u201cI suppose you approached the gods in advance?\u201d\u201cOdin was a great help. Did you know one of the eyes he has is this thing called the Wise Eye? It\u2019s very useful. Suggestions and brainwashing work very well on it. It was useful to shake his soul.\u201d\u00a0Hehehe.\u00a0Leo\u2019s laughter became louder.Yeon-woo turned in another direction. It was where Odin was in the middle of battling the Martial King.\u201cI thought he was a useless lower god, but he was useful for something like this. When you get the chance, you should try it sometime later. Although I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be able to.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t think I will.\u201d\u201cHa! Why? Are you scared?\u201d\u201cNo. All I have to do is rewind it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Leo frowned, not understanding, and a message popped up right in front of him.[According to the request of the user, the world of the dream is paused!]Leo squinted to read the message, then flinched. \u2018\u2026It paused?\u2019 Leo saw everything around him suddenly freeze except for him, and his heart turned cold. Those who were running away, the explosion of the gods, the dust clouds, the flying pieces of rocks\u2026 They were all paused.It wasn\u2019t that Yeon-woo stopped time with his ability, but the wheel of time itself was stopped. Leo looked at Yeon-woo with disbelief, and Yeon-woo snickered.[The dream is rewound.]The moment Yeon-woo twisted his right hand in the air, the world began to reverse. The flying pieces of rock returned to where they had been and became normal tiles again. The expanding dust clouds and heat took human shape again, and those who were swept away by the explosions came back to life.The scattered guests returned to where they were to congratulate the wedding of Yeon-woo and Edora, and the gods of Asgard were sitting down quietly in the guest area.The archangels, demon kings, and One-horned tribe no longer rushed around the battlefield. Even Agares and Fenrir were flung outside the wall. And\u2026the rewinding didn\u2019t stop there. Time was spun back and forth until the day before the wedding ceremony, to a month before all the wedding processes took place, to before Yeon-woo proposed to Edora\u2026 It continued to spin back before Yeon-woo even arrived at this time period and entered the previous time.The Tower crumbled, and R'lyeh squirmed then fell back asleep. Then\u2026it became a universe where nothing existed. It was the universe with only darkness and emptiness, the time of the beginning. The rewinding stopped there.\u201c\u2026!\u201d Leo\u2019s gaze trembled from shock. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. That\u2019s too much laws of causality\u2026\u201dThe reason why Leo decided to pick a fight with Yeon-woo was that, although Yeon-woo was the Black King\u2019s main ego, he wasn\u2019t the Black King. The Black King\u2019s true body was asleep in R'lyeh, which meant there had to be a limit to Yeon-woo\u2019s powers.If Yeon-woo tried to force the true body to move, the true body would wake up from his dream and the world would be destroyed. Leo thought Yeon-woo\u2019s moves would be limited because trying to go against the real body was going against the laws of causality\u2026 But from what he was seeing now, Yeon-woo was so free from the laws of causality that he was able to rewind time back to the very beginning of the wheel of time.\u201cSorry, but I didn\u2019t even use laws of causality.\u201d Yeon-woo smirked.\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026?!\u201d\u201cI told you. You\u2019re a wedding present for my teacher.\u201dLeo straightened his back at the sudden sense of incongruity. He looked around him. It was a universe where everything was dark. Just based on this, it looked like the universe of the beginning, but when he took a closer look, the substances of darkness weren\u2019t the same.The sides of the dimensions looked like they were being stretched out. It was something that shouldn\u2019t be happening. As long as the law of the Heavenly Demon\u2019s light was active, even the Black King wouldn\u2019t be able to adjust the fixed law\u2019s of the world according to his will since this wasn\u2019t his domain!\u2018Domain\u2026!\u2019 Only then did Leo realize why he was feeling a sense of incongruity. This world wasn\u2019t created naturally. It wasn\u2019t the original worldline, nor was it another worldline. It was a dream, a dream that the Black King was simply dreaming because he was bored\u2026Fwoosh!\u00a0Leo quickly distanced himself from Yeon-woo. Since he knew he was currently in a trap, the only thing he could do was run away.\u201cToo slow.\u201d However, Yeon-woo scoffed at Leo and stretched a hand toward him. He didn\u2019t even think to chase after him. This entire world was a temporary stage he created, so why should he do the bothersome act of running?Swish!\u00a0The world twisted, and laws moved. Dark substances were gathered into one and transformed into chains that shot toward Leo.\u00a0Clatter.\u201cDamn it!\u201d Leo was disbelieving of everything that was going on. He\u2019d confirmed this world was the original several times coming over from the Unreal World. Who would\u2019ve imagined the world he thought was an original was actually a trap? It was something only the Black King would have thought of.\u201cDon\u2019t come here!\u201d Leo crumpled his face at the chains that followed closely at his heels.\u00a0Pow, pow, pow! Crash!\u00a0He punched the air in front of him, and space was twisted and destroyed as the chains were deflected. But the chains started to chase after his weak spot again.\u00a0Kra, kra, Kra! Swish!\u00a0Leo frustratedly kicked the chains coming for his ankles and shouted, \u201cWhy won\u2019t it open?!\u201dFrom a while ago, Leo\u2019d been trying to open a door that led to the Unreal World. But strangely, he couldn\u2019t connect to the outside at all. It felt like he was blocked by something firm.\u201cOh, sorry, but you won't be able to return to where you came from. This world is already isolated from the others and is being managed separately.\u201dThat meant this world was pretty much like a closed jail cell.\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201dThe longer Leo\u2019s scream went on, the deeper Yeon-woo\u2019s smile became. \u2018I knew this method was right. I\u2019ve managed to trap a big fly.\u2019After capturing Tigris, Yeon-woo became certain the stars would somehow attempt to attack him or the Martial King. Their end goal was to obtain the other star fragments and obtain the omniscience that composed the world to be the one and the only true god of the new world.So, to catch the big fish, Yeon-woo used himself as bait and began to dream a new dream. While he created a dream that was exactly like the original worldline to attract the stars, he moved in this dream like it was reality.The Martial King\u2019s resurrection, the meeting between the two families, getting married to Edora\u2026 This was a part of the history that was used in the original worldline and a part of the true dream he was dreaming.In the end, Yeon-woo had managed to catch the lion constellation, so Yeon-woo was in good spirits. One part of him also wondered how he should make this bastard who dared to ruin his wedding, even if it hadn\u2019t been real.Yeon-woo\u2019s anger wouldn\u2019t be sated simply by capturing Leo. He had to force the star to give up all information by twisting and squeezing his soul. From the way to approach the Unreal World to how to find the bastards\u2026 Everything.\u201cDamn it! Dieeeeee!\u201d The growing amount of chains must\u2019ve been too much for Leo to deal with because he just dashed directly toward Yeon-woo. Based on the veins that popped out of his forehead, it seemed he was resentful at the fact that he was played by Yeon-woo.Of course, Yeon-woo just scoffed. Did that idiot not even remember how he picked a fight first? It was hilarious how he was acting like the victim.Clatter!\u00a0The chains took over Leo like an arrow lying in wait. Leo\u2019s fist was stopped right in front of Yeon-woo. He stiffened and trembled. His fist that wanted to shred Yeon-woo\u2019s face apart shook precariously. But as he was bound by Divine Iron, it was almost impossible for him to activate his holy power.Leo was already bound in chains like a cocoon, and only one of his eyes could be seen. \u201cYou\u2026fucking\u2026bastard\u2026!\u201d Leo\u2019s furious eyes were bloodshot.\u201cThank you for the compliment.\u201d With a cold smile, Yeon-woo tightly shut the lock around the chains and opened emptiness.Clatter. Clank, clank, clank!\u00a0The emptiness opened wide like a beast going after a delicious meal.\u201cI\u2019ll have to move you as carefully as possible. I can\u2019t let there be anything wrong with my gift.\u201d Yeon-woo\u2019s smirk finally turned into a smile.* * *Tak!\u00a0Jeong-woo shut the book he was reading and shook his head. His eyes were empty, like those of a dead fish\u2019s. \u201cWho exactly is good and evil here\u2026\u201d\u300eBam, bam, babam, bam! In the four beats~\u266c there\u2019s temper, backstabbing, and Yeon-woo~\u266a\u300fBehind Jeong-woo, Shanon was singing at the top of his lungs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 21": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Second Life RankerCH ss - 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySide Story Chapter 37 - Star Fragment (3)\u2018What can I do?\u2019 Sesha\u2019s mind became filled with complicated thoughts.Southern Arrow, Tigris, and Solarium\u2026 Each existence was strong enough to bring the world to an end. In fact, they were beings close to resembling \u2018beasts\u2019. No, they were more monstrous existences.The ability to devour a world meant that an existence possessed an exceedingly large legend, which meant that the existence could do many things. Considering that one\u2019s legend equated to a divine being\u2019s \u2018potential\u2019, these legend-possessing existences had many things they could do and could continue developing.Since Laplace was a being from \u2018outside\u2019 world, he may possess a level of strength comparable to these beings, but it was unclear whether he would be able to deal with three at once. In fact, Laplace\u2019s absence in this illusory world meant that he had faced some trouble back on Earth while contending against the middle-aged man.\u2018What shall I do\u2026?!\u2019\u201cYour expression seems complicated. Maybe we should help you ease it a little bit?\u201d Southern Arrow smiled coldly and took a step forward.Thud!\u00a0The Darkness Sphere trembled.Sesha\u2019s complexion turned pale. The spirit pressure was so immense that she felt as though her body and soul were being torn apart.\u00a0Whoosh!\u00a0Still, Sesha made every effort to protect Min Chae-young.And the more Sesha acted this way, the more Southern Arrow\u2019s cold smile grew wider. He acted like a cat who was playing around with its prey.\u201cHey. Stop playing around. Let\u2019s hurry this up. We still have a long road ahead of us. If the other group wins, will you take responsibility?\u201d Solarium grumbled as she looked at the Southern Arrow. She did not seem to like being in this area too long.The alliance they belonged to was in the process of collecting Star fragments while rapidly crossing various world lines. However, crossing a world line was not an easy task, and they needed to move carefully so as not to be noticed by \u2018Deus Ex Machina\u2019, the existence in charge of the law of causality. In fact, by staying in one world for a long time, beings of their size would easily be \u2018observed\u2019 by Deus Ex Machina, so they were under a time constraint and had to leave as soon as possible.However, the Southern Arrow was annoyed at Solarium because he wanted to enjoy some fun, even though he also knew they were under the clock.\u201cEh. I see, I get it. It\u2019ll be over soon.\u201d Southern Arrow gave a sinister smile with his white shiny teeth fully exposed. \u201cI wanted to watch you guys squirm a bit longer, but this granny is making it hard. Regrettably, I\u2019ll have to get rid of you now. For a brief moment, you\u2019ve made me happy, so I\u2019ll send you off without too much pain.\u201dSouthern Arrow reached out towards Sesha and Min Chae-young. To Sesha, the gesture seemed slow. She felt as if the world around her had slowed down. Sesha could see Southern Arrow\u2019s hand movement and spirit pressure, and even the expression on his face in detail\u2026 The problem was that her movements had slowed to match the slowed world. Essentially, she could not move. There was only one thing Sesha could do\u2026 Ignite Nephilim\u2019s Flame.The brilliance of Nephilim\u2019s Flame was so great and unexpected that Southern Arrow\u2019s smile widened. But that reaction only lasted for a moment, as he was determined to make quick work of both girls. Right then\u2026Boom!\u00a0Suddenly, a huge shockwave shook the illusory world, the Darkness Sphere. Southern Arrow directed his gaze upward. Solarium\u2019s eyes grew wide. The shockwave\u2019s impact on the illusory world alluded to the great power of the outside existence.Just as expected\u2026 From where the shockwave originated, a man appeared.\u201cGrandfather!\u201d Sesha shouted with a delighted expression.Southern Arrow had clearly stated that the Darkness Sphere was clearly cut off from observation. But then, how did Sesha\u2019s grandfather find this place?Kronos looked down with a hardened face. \u201cI wondered why I wasn\u2019t getting a signal on the magic field\u2026 How dare you bastards touch my granddaughter?\u201dIt was only then that Sesha knew how Kronos had found her. The tablet PC he gave her as a present. It seemed that Kronos had put a tracking magic field device on it. The tracking magic field device would normally be off when she was nearby but turn on automatically if she was not near it. And once that tracking device turned on, Kronos found out that Sesha had disappeared from Earth.\u201cThe king of gods\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt seems to be the Kronos of this world line. No matter which world line we go to, he\u2019s always been a nuisance\u2026 I didn\u2019t expect to meet him in this world line as well.\u201d\u201cPlease, take care of him.\u201d\u201cSure, but hurry. The longer you take, the more annoying this situation will become.\u201dBam!\u00a0Solarium smiled and flew toward Kronos. One of Kronos\u2019 eyebrows twitched. Though he had no idea who these beings were, Kronos did not appreciate their laid-back attitude and how they dared to comfortably converse amongst themselves while he was present.\u201cI don\u2019t know who you all are, but I\u2019ll make sure to rip off a pair of limbs on each of you before allowing you to speak again.\u201d Kronos stretched his hand forward. Then, as the space twisted and his divine power condensed, a huge scythe appeared.Scythe\u2026 Originally, it was Kronos\u2019 main body when he was resurrected, but now it was separate from his soul. Scythe had become a divine weapon that contained his powers. Since Pneuma\u2019s Sky was contained within, Scythe could control time. Yeon-woo always handled Scythe in the form of a sword, but for Kronos, the scythe form was the most comfortable for him to handle.The power to wind time and bring death to life. The concept of the Grim Reaper, who symbolized the concept of \u2018harvesting death from life\u2019, originated from Kronos in the first place.Whoosh!\u00a0Kronos swung Scythe down vigorously. He was planning on splitting Solarium and reaping her soul.Seeing Kronos\u2019 movement, Solarium snorted. Even in the world line where she originally inhabited, Kronos existed. And whenever she crossed each world line to retrieve the Star fragments, she met countless versions of Kronos, who looked more or less like the one in front of her. Though most of them were once strong enough to earn the title of king of gods\u2026\u2018In the end, your powers are limited.\u2019The existence of a \u2018star\u2019 meant that a being had already annihilated a world line and devoured its powers. This meant that the being would be close to an \u2018emperor\u2019 level being, which meant it had acquired a uniqueness that transcended the world lines. Thus, in Solarium\u2019s mind, it did not make sense that a being that lived within a world line could confront her, no matter how strong of a being it was. Could they block a \u2018star\u2019? Was this not the same as a frog that lived down in the well talking about how great it was without knowing how wide the world is?Kronos\u2019 threatening words were just a joke for Solarium. Thus, she planned on showing this version of Kronos just how wide the gap was between them\u2026!\u2018What is this\u2026?\u2019 As Solarium approached Kronos with confidence and flashed around her powers, she soon started frowning. Her powers\u2026had suddenly stopped shining. They had become non-operational.\u201cIdiot.\u201d Kronos smiled coldly. That smile conveyed a lot to Solarium. \u201cI don\u2019t know what or who you are, but if I cut the progress of time to a time before you can bring out your powers, then you\u2019ll essentially be powerless, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d Only then did Solarium realize what Kronos had done. Kronos had forcibly cut off time to a point before she released her powers! Solarium wondered if this type of attack was even possible, and she grew fearful of the being that stated he cut off time in such a nonchalant way.[Pneuma\u2019s Sky \u2013 Cutting Off Power]\u2018This world line\u2019s Kronos is different from the other Kronos I\u2019ve come across!\u2019 However, when Solarium realized this, it was already too late. Scythe tore through her, from the nape of her left neck to her right waist. That was how her life ended, the star constellation known as Solarium.Though he had made a great achievement, Kronos did not stop to appreciate his work. As soon as he sliced through Solarium, Kronos flew toward Sesha.Boom!***Like Solarium, the Southern Arrow had to contend with another being. \u2018How could this be\u2026?!\u2019 The being in front of him seemed to show no interest in him, as he stood in place, frozen like a block of ice.Rhea was hugging Sesha and saying that everything was fine.\u201cGrandmother\u2026!\u201d\u201cAre you okay? Did you injure yourself anywhere?\u201dNod!\u00a0Sesha went into her grandmother\u2019s arms and nodded vigorously. She wept and wailed. When her grandfather and grandmother suddenly appeared, Sesha unwittingly let go of the tension that she was holding on to, so tears had welled up and burst out from her eyes.\u201cMy child, you must have been very surprised. Who the hell did this to you? Who tormented our dear grandchild? Who made you cry, child?\u201dSesha pointed at Southern Arrow. \u201cThat bastard!\u201d\u201cOkay. So, it\u2019s him. Perhaps this grandmother of yours should teach him a lesson?\u201d Rhea smiled kindly before gently pushing Sesha and Min Chae-young behind her.At that moment, Min Chae-young looked at Rhea with complicated emotions reflected in her eyes. It was because Min Chae-young recalled her mother, who left her alone with her stepfather one day before running away.Step!\u00a0Rhea moved towards Southern Arrow. It was a light step, but the result was anything but that. The constricting force Southern Arrow felt increased with every step Rhea took.[Quirinale\u2019s World \u2013 Absolute Realm]\u201cThis\u2026!\u201d Southern Arrow\u2019s eyes were bloodshot. He felt as if the space around him, or the entire Darkness Sphere, had been frozen. An unbelievable, unfathomable scene was unfolding. Someone else was taking control of his holy territory! One\u2019s holy territory was based on one\u2019s legends, so it should only be controllable by the owner of the illusory world. It should have been impossible for another being to occupy and control one\u2019s illusory world without permission. For that to be possible, either the owner of the holy territory had to be killed or the associated legends devoured.However, Rhea had skipped over these assumed requirements. And she did it in a very matter-of-fact way. She had easily entered and appeared inside the Darkness Sphere, as if she had come to visit her own house. She was now extending her hand towards Southern Arrow.Rhea also lacked the quality of uniqueness, so she also existed in other world lines. In the other world lines, she was also the last descendant of the Quirinale and dealt with space. However, there was no version of Rhea who handled the concept of \u2018space\u2019 as freely as the one in front of Southern Arrow. This was the first time he had met such an omnipotent version of Rhea.Kronos, and now Rhea\u2026 Southern Arrow wondered what the hell happened on this world line that made it so different from the Kronos and Rhea\u2019s of the other world lines.\u201cAre you curious about what happened to my husband and I?\u201d\u2018\u2026!\u2019\u201cWell, even if I told you, you wouldn\u2019t be able to comprehend.\u201dStep. Step.\u00a0Rhea approached Southern Arrow. The closer she came, the more the Southern Arrow\u2019s complexion turned pale. It did not end with the simple transfer of ownership of his holy territory. Rhea was now looking deep into his Consciousness, which made up the holy territory! This meant that Rhea had not only taken control of his holy territory, but she had made Dark Sphere completely her own.\u2018I have to tell this fact to the others\u2026 I need to somehow let them know\u2026!\u2019 Southern Arrow was thrown into a sense of crisis, a feeling he had not felt in a long time. He wanted to let the alliance know that this world line was dangerous. If he did so, considering his merits and good deeds, perhaps they would resurrect him? However, Southern Arrow\u2019s thoughts were easily read by Rhea.\u201cIn the old days, I used to go here and there because of that immature husband of mine, but now my husband and I are not interested in going anywhere else.\u201d Rhea stopped right in front of Southern Arrow and stared coolly into his eyes. \u201cSo, don\u2019t even think about coming near us again. If you come, even after this warning\u2026\u201dRhea\u2019s hand gradually covered Southern Arrow\u2019s face. \u201cI won\u2019t leave you guys alone.\u201dBoom!\u00a0Rhea tapped Southern Arrow\u2019s forehead very lightly with her index finger. It was a simple move. However, the result was unimaginably destructive.Whoosh!\u00a0As the entire Darkness Sphere sank down, all the powers that Southern Arrow possessed collapsed and formed into tiny pieces of sand on the ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Boom! Whoosh!\u00a0The grass shook from the surrounding fields, and soldiers soon appeared everywhere. They had expressionless faces as if they were wearing a mask, but Vivasvat sensed that they were feeling unsettled. They seemed to have been rattled, fearing a mere mortal. Some of the forces had reached low-level divine status, but none of them seemed to think they could \u2018beat\u2019 Vivasvat.\u2018Then there\u2019s nothing more to see or think about.\u2019 Vivasvat smiled coldly and started to recharge his Great Handprint.Rumble.\u00a0Thunder roared incessantly as a palm formation wind swept through the enemy camp like lightning. Eventually, when his opponent\u2019s advances were slowed, Vivasvat turned his attention and senses to Garmr. She was still fighting with Urd.Clash! Clash! Boom!\u00a0It was a\u00a0fierce fight that did not offer either opponent an inch to breathe. Garmr fought with a ferocity and power that Vivasvat had not seen in the past year he served under her command. The sight of explosions, exploding one after another, occurring every time she swung her ax-like sword was enough to make every observer\u2019s spine chill.Urd, who was fighting with all her might, seemed to show why she was considered the best among the Valkyries. However, for some reason, Urd showed signs of impatience. She must have been wary of Vivasvat joining the fight, as her two trusted sisters had easily succumbed to his attacks just moments ago. In the end, no matter how good or accomplished a warrior was, it seemed inevitable that one would always seek to retain one\u2019s precious life.Reading the situation, Vivasvat was about to enter the fray and help Garmr.\u300eDon\u2019t join.\u300f Vivasvat heard Garmr\u2019s voice ring in his ear. Though Vivasvat frowned, Garmr\u2019s voice was firm.\u300eYou have some work to do.\u300f\u300eWhat work\u2026?\u300f\u300eRescue the villagers. They\u2019re probably detained somewhere around here. If the battle continues like this, all the villagers will be killed, as they\u2019ll just weigh the enemy down. So, move!\u300fVivasvat clenched his jaw. He hesitated as he pondered what he should do. He wondered whether he should listen to Garmr or not.\u300eHurry!\u300fHowever, due to Garmr\u2019s continued requests, Vivasvat forced himself to move in the opposite direction.\u300e\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u300f\u300eFor what?\u300f\u300eTo put you in this position because of me\u2026!\u300f Vivasvat bit down on his lower lip. At the thought that all the things befalling on Bifrost was due to him, Vivasvat felt a sense of guilt, which weighed down heavily on his heart.\u300eWhat the hell are you talking about? So self-centered. Why is this all because of you?\u300f Rather than any rebuke or concern, Garmr responded back with a smile.Vivasvat opened his eyes wide, not understanding what Garmr was saying. Garmr suddenly gathered her magic energy and let out a Lion\u2019s Roar. \u201cBifrost!\u201d Her voice reverberated and echoed out loudly.Urd, who was facing Garmr, as well as everyone else on the battlefield, was startled and hurriedly turned to her. However, only the members of Bifrost showed an unwavering response.\u201cEveryone, open a path for the youngest to pass!\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201d\u201cFinally! I was wondering when an order would be issued! Hmpf!\u201dThe Bifrost members began to move in unison as they answered loudly. They no longer just stood their ground against the rushing enemies but started pushing back.Bam! Bam!\u00a0Any outside observer would have marveled at the formation that allowed Vivasvat to move forward without much deterrence. Of course, the damage suffered by the troop members increased because of that, but they did not seem to care very much.\u201cHurry!\u201d\u201cHurry up, youngest! Your brethren are strong, but not that strong!\u201d\u201cYeah! Run like your life depends on it!\u201dVivasvat could not help but feel confused. The way everyone moved without hesitation after receiving Garmr\u2019s order made his heart ache. On the other hand, he wondered what problem awaited them for disobeying Asgard\u2019s command.\u300eMove to Zone Z19. If you go there, the reinforcement unit should be waiting for you. But be careful, if you don\u2019t arrive on time, they\u2019ll leave you behind without looking back.\u300f\u300eWhat\u2019s the meaning of this\u2026!\u300f\u300eWhat\u2019s happening? Is that what you\u2019re asking?\u300f There seemed to be some laughter in Garmr\u2019s voice.\u300eSurely, you didn\u2019t think that you were the only one who detested the gods, right?\u300f\u300eThen\u2026?\u300f\u300eSuffice it to say that we all have similar thoughts as you do. You\u2019re the Heavenly Demon\u2019s son, right? You and your past is quite popular amongst the members. It seems you wreaked havoc in the outside world.\u300f\u300e\u2026!\u300f\u300eStill, one can\u2019t believe all the rumors, so I was planning on testing your mettle one way or another\u2026 Too bad things happened as they did before that.\u300fIn Garmr\u2019s voice, Vivasvat could feel a sense of peace and calm. It seemed she was happy to finally speak out about the secrets that she had to keep within herself.\u300eAnyway, run. You can do it right? The situation isn\u2019t great, but you can probably do it.\u300fVivasvat nodded heavily.\u300eOf course.\u300f He knew that was enough small talk.Bam!<Shukuchi>Vivasvat followed the path made by his colleagues and activated his skills one after another. A call to grab him quickly rang out from everywhere, but there was no one who could stop him.\u00a0Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u00a0The gusts that arose whenever he stepped on the ground soon turned into violent typhoons and covered the entire mountainside and valley. Additionally, the flashes of light that occurred within this realm moved with a ferocious sharpness.As if slashed with a sharpened sword, the enemies who attacked Vivasvat fell one after another while vomiting blood. Moreover, the Bifrost attacks were already wreaking havoc on their enemies. The enemies had lost the momentum a long time ago.One Against a Thousand Enemies\u2026 Unmoving Against Ten Thousand Opponents\u2026 These maxims all seemed to refer to them.[The Asgard forces in hiding have made their appearance!]In the end, the Olympus forces alone were not enough to stop Vivasvat, so the Asgard forces, who had been on standby as auxiliary forces, poured into the battlefield. But even they fell helplessly like dominoes.Suddenly, Vivasvat lifted his head up to the sky instead of running forward. He felt an unusual energy. He saw a group of black, dark clouds gathering. \u2018A great god!\u2019Though the level of the being was termed \u2018great\u2019, the intensity and power possessed by gods at that level could not easily be expressed in words. Even if all the lesser gods of a society banded together, they would not be able to muster a challenge against a single great god. A great god was like a vast sky. With its will, a great god seemed to be able to move the world.[Odin is descending!][Zeus is descending!]Though he possessed calm eyes, Odin exhibited a force that flowed like a bloody storm. Meanwhile, Zeus exuded a strong sense of force like lightning. The appearance of these two people was bound to cause tension for Vivasvat.\u300eHahaha. I was wondering who was causing all this ruckus. I guess the Heavenly Demon\u2019s son is truly the Heavenly Demon\u2019s son?\u300f\u300e\u2026\u300fWhenever Zeus burst out into laughter, the entire stage, no, seemingly the entire world shook. It felt as if the Tower would collapse at any moment.\u2018How the hell did father manage to entrap these guys here?\u2019 Unconsciously, Vivasvat tensed up. Although he knew that these main great gods were strong, he thought he had largely caught up to them after honing his skills for the past year within the Tower. However, at this moment, Vivasvat knew that he would be fighting an uphill battle.Vivasvat was especially wary of Odin, more so than the laughing Zeus. The figure of Odin, who showed no emotion as if he was wearing a mask, was terrifying. He somehow felt that Odin was an arch nemesis. There was no particular reason. It was just an intuition. However, that was enough to keep him on edge. Vivasvat\u2019s sense of intuition surpassed most people\u2019s ability to see into the future.\u2018Rescuing the villagers may not be easy\u2026\u2019With such a thought, Vivasvat smacked his lips. And then\u2026\u00a0Boom!\u00a0Without further delay, he flung himself forward.***Bam!\u201cDo you recall up to here?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Nocturne slowly tilted his drink and nodded in response to the question that the Heavenly Demon asked after putting down his drink. These memories were already in his mind, but they felt far away, as if he was viewing them through an old television set.When the Heavenly Demon personally offered him a drink, everything came to life as if Nocturne had truly returned to that time. It was a feeling that could only be recalled by those who had experienced those things \u2018directly\u2019, experiences that had \u2018actually\u2019 happened in that bloody place. Thus, Nocturne was sure that his memories were \u2018real\u2019.\u201cAt that time, you really went through a lot of struggles. Even though Zeus and Odin were somewhat hindered with the Heavenly Demon disease, they still weren\u2019t pushovers.\u201d The Heavenly Demon scratched his cheek with his index finger, apparently because he was unfamiliar with verbalizing \u2018Heavenly Demon\u2019 when referring to himself. \u201cOdin was especially persistent. He wanted to catch you somehow at all costs.\u201dNocturne quietly nodded his head.After the clash with Zeus and Odin, Vivasvat had to fight off a relentless pursuit. He had to safely rescue the hostages while fending against the two gods. No matter how much Bifrost helped, he was in a disadvantaged situation. As a result, considerable sacrifices and damage ensued.Among his troubles, Odin caused Vivasvat the greatest headache. Odin ran rampant in his storm with an expressionless face\u2026 He was fear itself. Underneath Odin\u2019s expressionless face, which Vivasvat could not fathom, Odin\u2019s cruel hands unleashed relentless magic spells and attacks.\u201cI can understand why he was so persistent. Odin had a different purpose than that of Zeus.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d As Nocturne was hearing this for the first time, he had no choice but to open his eyes wide.\u201cZeus was going to catch you and use you as bait to lure me out. However, Odin was concerned that you might be the one that appeared in their great prophecy.\u201d\u201cThe Great Prophecy\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s like the curse that Odin received after defeating the colossus Bestla, before his ascension as a creation god\u2026 One day, when a wildly burning star arises, the sun and moon will be devoured, and the age of wolves will come, and the world will be drenched in darkness. You gods will be drawn together into the setting twilight.\u201d The Heavenly Demon laughed as he recited the great prophecy, which was once popular and all-consuming within Asgard.\u201cTwilight\u2026 Curse\u2026\u201d Nocturne mumbled the two words as if he understood. It was Ragnar\u00f6k. The great prophecy, meaning \u2018the fate of the gods\u2019 or the \u2018Twilight of the gods\u2019, was something that he certainly heard.Various societies speculated that the prophecy referred to the impending great war that would inevitably happen between Asgard and their arch enemy, Niflheim. But in the end, before even approaching anything like Ragnar\u00f6k, Asgard had been put in their place by Nocturne\u2019s master. If one thought about it that way, one would end up dismissing the great prophecy as being something insignificant, but it seemed that it was very important and all-consuming for Odin.\u201cOdin had been collecting all kinds of prophecies for a very long time. Even when he was unconscious and asleep. Then, he saw you suddenly appear, a wildly rising star. He put two and two together and concluded that you must be the rising star in the great prophecy.\u201dThe name Vivasvat referred to the sun god. It literally meant \u2018star\u2019. Besides, Vivasvat at that time must have looked especially splendid since he always emanated a dazzling light distribution around his body.Moreover, the being was already contending against gods, so it was natural for Odin to assume that Vivasvat was the being stated in the great prophecy.\u201cThen, was the great prophecy incorrect?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dNocturne frowned as if he did not appreciate the Heavenly Demon\u2019s non-committal answer. He felt frustrated at looking at the Heavenly Demon\u2019s seemingly smug, omniscient expression.\u201cRegardless.\u201d As if there was no need to talk about the great prophecy anymore, the Heavenly Demon continued the conversation\u2019s topic to something else. \u201cYou managed to escape from the sixteenth floor with the hostages after evading their relentless pursuit, and thus your name became very popular in the Tower. And then you became the singular Resistance within the Tower. You carried the name\u2026\u201dThe Heavenly Demon paused and smiled, and Nocturne had to forcefully suppress his curses. It was a name that would always make one\u2019s heart flutter, and a being that served mortals rather than the gods. It was someone fighting for the individual rather than a society, for freedom rather than oppression, and a name created to serve the mortal rather than the immortal.\u201c\u2026Allforone.\u201dIt was not Vivasvat/Nocturne\u2019s original name.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It also contained the principles of the Bright Tai Chi Pangu Sword.It was what Yeon-woo utilized when he tore down the Tower, and he had completed it after repeating countless mistakes in the darkness.Slip.\u00a0Yeon-woo slowly moved his finger sword downward. It was so slow that it would make any observer yawn. Moreover, it seemed as if time had slowed down. However, this was just what it seemed. The reality was that nothing had changed.The Martial King remained motionless while Yeon-woo\u2019s fingers moved downwards atop his head.From the movement, the Martial king saw another universe within. Life and death. Positive and negative. Light and darkness. Fire and water. Above and below. Left and right\u2026 He saw opposite properties, like two sides of a coin, but they were also inseparable. Tai Chi was the mixing of two opposing forces and turning them around, and Bright Pangu was the act of breaking free from this cycle.The realization of the Bright Tai Chi Pangu Sword started from there. One must throw away the preconceived notions one had and escape from the overarching providence by untangling oneself from the superstructure.However, despite his achievements and realization, the Martial King had not been able to obtain the Bright Tai Chi Pangu Sword until the end because his very existence was completely entangled in providence. It was a limitation that one had since birth, and it was also a weakness that every existence possessed.Even though Yeon-woo knew this, he hoped he could provide the Martial King with the hope of one day breaking through and acquiring the Bright Tai Chi Pangu Sword principle.The Martial King\u2019s attention was completely captured. This was the best time to get a clue, while he was immensely focused and wandering in the swamp of enlightenment.Of course, in the end, the Martial King may never be able to attain the Bright Tai Chi Pangu Sword. It may remain forever as just a seed in his heart, or it may just pass by his consciousness like an afterimage.However, Yeon-woo had no doubts that the Martial King would succeed at one time or another. This was because he knew that the Martial King was a monster. \u2018That monster-like quality goes for this version of my master as well.\u2019Just as expected, Yeon-woo could see the various brilliant lights flickering within the Martial King\u2019s eyes. Those lights flickered repeatedly. Just as a wildly burning star breaks down to become a nebula and mixes with other nebulae to form a new star\u2026 The epiphanies and enlightenment that the Martial King was obtaining twinkled like stars. They would soon collapse and be re-established.Enlightenment was the light, and the light was the star. And that light had escaped the Martial King\u2019s eyes and was now radiating from his body.\u00a0Whoosh!\u00a0Like fine snow falling, particles of light rose and sank downwards. It was similar to, but different from, the light that transcendent beings usually emanated. The light distribution of the other transcendent beings had a solemn quality, but his master\u2019s light distribution seemed dazzling and warm.Yeon-woo knew. If his master\u2019s light were to ever burn wildly with anger, it would become a huge flame that would engulf the world.The sun from afar was very beautiful and warm, but when anything got close, it disintegrated, disappearing without a trace. The Martial King was becoming such a being.<Star>.This was what Yeon-woo wanted to call the Martial King. God. Demon. Giant. Draconic. The Martial King was walking down a path that was entirely different from those beings.\u2018Dang.\u2019 Yeon-woo could not help but smile when he saw this. \u2018You really do have a knack at doing absurd things.\u2019Although Yeon-woo had only shown a principle, the Martial King was able to gain enlightenment, and based on that, he would probably be able to find a new path towards exuviation and transcendence. Yeon-woo thought that this was great. And for that reason, he had no choice but to acknowledge the Martial King. His master had essentially raised him and was the father of his one and only wife.As Yeon-woo was having such thoughts\u2026\u00a0Boom!\u00a0The eighth extreme of sword thunder strike covered the starlight that the <Star> proudly emanated, and the Bright Tai Chi Pangu Sword swept the space.***\u201cW-What was that?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWho won?\u201d\u201cDamn it, I feel so dizzy. Please tell me the results!\u201dThe members of the tribe, who were watching the match between Yeon-woo and the Martial King, grew restless. They had been observing a fierce battle that they could barely keep up with, and then a barrier had suddenly appeared around the two combatants. However, at some point, only flickering lights could be seen.Even so, the tribe members who were quite talented burst into admiration as they quickly followed the traces of the two combatants. It was exactly what they had hoped for!Not to mention the Martial King, Yeon-woo exhibited a power level and skill set that rivaled, if not surpassing, the Martial King. Moreover, as they continued to observe the battle, they each gained a sense of enlightenment on their own path. In other words, their eyes had been opened.Then, Yeon-woo came out with the Bright Tai Chi Pangu Sowrd. All the members of the tribe jumped up from their seats.Edora also jumped up in surprise. It was the overbearing and seemingly immovable wall that she so desperately wanted to break through but never could. The essence of what the tribe had been trying to overcome for hundreds of years was being exhibited by Yeon-woo.And then, an explosion. A swarm of lights filled the inside of the barrier, and the subsequent harsh vibrations even reached the observers. The barrier shook violently as if it would break at any moment.Some of the tribe members tried to approach the barrier, fearing that something wrong may have happened within.\u201cEveryone, clear away from the barrier!\u201d The head elder hastily blocked his tribe members\u2019 approach. If the barrier exploded, a crisis would befall the entire Tower, as well as their village. Everything might be blown away. Even though the attacks had been contained within the barrier, the aftershock forces felt outside the barrier were strong enough to make one\u2019s hair stand upright.Then, suddenly, the barrier disappeared. The collection of lights, which seemed to want to explode at any moment, faded away, and instead, only the two, Yeon-woo and the Martial King, appeared.\u201cUh, uh\u2026?\u201d\u201cDid they really fight properly?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t we all see the same thing? How come they both look okay?\u201dThe members of the tribe widened their eyes as they looked at the two. Even though the two had obviously been in a fierce battle, the two of them stood without showing any signs of being greatly exhausted, let alone injured.Rather, the Martial King had a cheerful grin on his face. It was a face that seemed to suggest that he had realized something. There was warmth in his gaze as he looked at Yeon-woo. \u201cQuite good.\u201dThe Martial King no longer emanated the bright halo of light that Yeon-woo referred to as \u2018starlight\u2019. This was because the Martial King had used up all the light to parry the Bright Tai Chi Pangu Sword strike.\u201cYou\u2019ve grown a lot.\u201dDrip!\u00a0In an instant, the Martial King, who had been smiling and laughing heartily, collapsed onto the ground with blood dripping from the side of his lip.Plop!\u00a0When the powerless sound rang out, everyone fell into a long silence. It was the first time anyone had seen the Martial King fall onto the ground. Up to now, the Martial King had always been a supreme figure who had never been defeated within the tribe. It was shocking for every member of the tribe as it shattered all of their common sense.\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cNice!\u201d\u201cFinally! The chieftain has fallen!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dAt the same time, the tribe members felt a collective exhilarating feeling after seeing their \u2018evil\u2019 chieftain, who had tormented them so badly, collapse. They felt a strong vicarious satisfaction through Yeon-woo, who had defeated their monster-like chieftain in their stead.\u00a0Cheer!\u00a0The village shook with cheers.***\u201cYou\u2019re coming back as soon as you can, right?\u201d\u201cI really am. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d Yeon-woo looked at himself with a little pity. He smiled bitterly as he looked at Edora, who was looking at him with concern. Yeon-woo was able to feel the torment and pain that Edora had suffered while waiting for him all this time. Thus, Yeon-woo reached out with his hand and gently stroked Edora\u2019s purple hair.Like a cat savoring another\u2019s touch, Edora\u2019s face grew languid as she took it all in.\u201cIn your perspective, I\u2019ll only be disappearing for a very short time. You\u2019ll see me back in no time.\u201dYeon-woo was about to turn the \u2018wheel\u2019 to a time where he could visit his parents, Kronos and Rhea. He needed to bring the two of them to the parent meet-and-greet event. And although he did not say anything to Edora, when he had time, he was thinking about looking for the Martial King\u2019s remaining \u2018pieces\u2019 in his spare time.The present Martial King was still incomplete. Yeon-woo had somehow managed to resurrect him with the omnipotence he possessed, but he was not sure how long this version of the Martial King would last.The Martial King was like a brittle glass bowl that could break and spill what it contained at any moment. Fortunately, once the Martial King was able to give off his own light and became a transcendent <Star>, his identity was completely established and imprinted into an Idea, so there was no need to worry about the Martial King disappearing for the time being.\u2018But the sooner I resolve everything, the better.\u2019In the end, an imperfect existence was just that, imperfect. The Martial King was aware of this fact, which led Yeon-woo to become more in awe at how the Martial King was taking everything in stride.If he were in his master\u2019s position, would he be that calm? Yeon-woo recalled wandering in the darkness for what seemed like an eternity, so he appreciated the Martial King\u2019s attitude even more.\u2018Well. He\u2019s also not a stranger.\u2019 A slight smile crept onto Yeon-woo\u2019s lips. \u2018Family.\u2019The Martial King was now part of Yeon-woo\u2019s family. In the social, outer world, the Martial King was his teacher, and publicly, his master was an expert martial artist. But to Yeon-woo, he would now become his father. And helping his father was the right thing to do as a son.\u201cHmm\u2026 I wish you\u2019d go after father awakes.\u201d Edora did not want to let go of Yeon-woo. She spoke with a voice full of regret as she grabbed Yeon-woo\u2019s hem.Yeon-woo hugged Edora. \u201cWhat do you think he\u2019ll say when he wakes up and sees me?\u201dHaving said that, Edora could not respond. As Yeon-woo mentioned, if the Martial King woke up and saw Yeon-woo, her father would probably want to go another round. He would probably keep fighting until he got the match he wanted. Edora knew that her father would do so.In the end, it was as if Yeon-woo was running away while the Martial King passed out.Ah!\u00a0Edora let out a long sigh. Even now, her father was grabbing onto her ankles. However, understanding this and truly being sad were two different things. Edora groaned and pouted her lips.\u201cReally, really, really, really\u2026 You have to come back soon.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d Yeon-woo smiled lightly and hugged Edora tighter.[The \u2018wheel\u2019 is turning and fast-forwarding!]Yeon-woo quietly disappeared from the spot. Edora was left all alone. She sighed once more.***The Martial King, who was lying in bed, slowly opened his eyes. The moment his eyes opened\u2026\u201c\u2026he left.\u201d The Martial King knew that Yeon-woo would leave while he was asleep. However, he did not bother to catch his disciple. As Yeon-woo said, his master would want to hold him down persistently, asking for another match. However, the Martial King could not do what he truly wanted, as he knew what lay in front of Yeon-woo.The Martial King slowly raised his hands which were filled with hard calluses. His hands, which were much larger than the other tribe members\u2019, was proof of how much training he had done and how strong his enemies were when he defeated them.For the Martial King, who preferred to fight head-on by bumping bodies with his opponent without using any special weapons, his two hands were his sword and his shield. And a little while ago, it was also a hand that had finally competed with a disciple who surpassed his master.It was his life and his path. It represented his achievements. It was the result of everything that comprised him.Thus, the Martial King always loved his two hands. Even if he was given another heavenly or divine treasure, he would not trade away his two hands. All the memories were vividly contained within them. They were completely and wholly his. When he became a <Star>\u2026 the ecstasy he felt when he saw the truth of the Bright Tai Chi Pangu Sword was also clearly \u2018real\u2019.However\u2026the thought that maybe everything he observed was just an illusion and that it might be \u2018fake\u2019 made him a bit upset. Even though all his memories were clear and vivid, the thought that they might have all been \u2018manipulated\u2019 twisted his mind. He felt like it was unfair.\u201cHey, wife.\u201d\u300e\u2026\u300f\u201cCan you believe it?\u201d\u300e\u2026stop.\u300f\u201cI lost? Hahaha!\u201d\u300eDo you know how many times you\u2019ve said that already?\u300f\u201cI mean, it feels really weird. I feel perfectly fine here.\u201d\u300eAny passing person would probably think you\u2019re drunk. Why are you repeating the same words over and over?\u300f\u201cTo think, I\u2019m an illusion that doesn\u2019t really exist.\u201d\u300e\u2026\u300fThe Martial King let out a long sigh as he looked up at the ceiling. The \u2018truth\u2019 that Yeon-woo had told him flashed through his mind.\u201cMaster.\u201d\u00a0Yeon-woo\u2019s voice was deeply subdued when he spoke these lines.\u00a0\u201cI did unto you what you did with Nocturne.\u201dThe Martial King here was not the real Martial King. He was just an existence made up of traces his original self had left behind. He was a shadow. Yeon-woo had brought him out from the twenty-first floor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was as if he was speaking with an immature minor. However, Vivasvat did not object. Rather, he narrowed his eyes and observed his opponent.Vivasvat was wary of his opponent because of the rumors that preceded him. Even if most of the rumors were simple exaggerations, even if only some of them were true, Vivasvat knew that he currently did not have the power level to deal with Sun Wukong. Moreover, Vivasvat was scanning his surroundings to secure a way out in case things went south.\u201cOho? You\u2019re unlike what they say about Jiho\u2019s son. You\u2019re much calmer than I expected. Are you really Jiho\u2019s son?\u201d Sun Wukong was a little startled by Vivasvat\u2019s reaction. Based on the Heavenly Demon he knew, Sun Wukong expected that the Heavenly Demon\u2019s son would have already called him an idiot and rushed headfirst at him without thinking about the consequences. However, Vivasvat showed no signs of such agitation, let alone excitement.\u201cHmm, perhaps you resemble your mother?\u201d Sun Wukong grumpily muttered to himself as he hung the Ruyi Bang on his back. It seemed that Sun Wukong had been looking forward to a good spar.\u201cWell, it probably doesn\u2019t matter. Anyway, little boy, stop running around all over the place and go home. Your mom and dad are worried about you. Stop causing concern for them and return.\u201d Sun Wukong treated Vivasvat like a young boy who ran away from home. If Vivasvat did not follow his words, it seemed that Sun Wukong was planning on knocking Vivasvat out and dragging him back home.However, Vivasvat continued to look at Sun Wukong while having his Great Handprint skill readied. He remained quiet. As if he was about to die of frustration, Sun Wukong made a frustrated expression and was about to say something in annoyance. However, just at that moment, Vivasvat spoke up. \u201cWhere my father is\u2026 You seem to know.\u201d\u2018You.\u2019 Sun Wukong smiled. Even amid the countless iterations of the turning \u2018wheel\u2019, few people had ever referred to him as \u2018you.\u2019 \u201cAnd if I do?\u201d\u201cTell me where my father is. I must see my father.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t feel like telling you.\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m already tired and angry about having to come here, but now, you want me to get involved in a father and son quarrel? I will not.\u201d\u201c\u2026If that\u2019s the case, I guess there\u2019s only one action I can take.\u201d\u201cOh! Are you going to do something about it?\u201dPhew.\u00a0Vivasvat lightly sighed and cracked his neck.\u00a0Crack. \u00a0As his body relaxed, Vivasvat\u2019s magic powers began flowing smoothly. The aura of light that was wrapped around him began to shine brighter.\u201cI have no choice but to force you to speak.\u201dWhoosh!\u00a0A strong wind began to swirl around Vivasvat. The wind grew to become a great gust of wind, soon turning into a typhoon. It shook the entire planet, which was already perilously teetering. If things remained like this, it seemed like the planet would soon shatter into pieces.Amid a strong typhoon wind, Sun Wukong\u2019s long gray hair fluttered and swayed.\u00a0Smile.\u201cYou.\u201d Sun Wukong was smiling brightly as if he found the developing events immensely satisfying. \u201cSo, you are Jiho\u2019s son.\u201dAnd with those words\u2026\u00a0Bam!\u00a0A fierce battle between Vivasvat and Sun Wukong began.***After a while, the descriptive words to describe what went on changed. It was no more a \u2018fierce battle\u2019 as it was a one-sided beat down, an utterly one-sided beatdown. That was the most accurate way to describe what happened.\u201cHahaha! It\u2019ll still take you a million years for a kid like you to chase after this old man!\u201dRumble!\u00a0Sun Wukong literally slapped Vivasvat around. Whenever Vivasvat launched a Great Handprint attack, Sun Wukong would avoid it casually and then slap Vivasvat on the back of his head. And if Vivasvat tried to approach Sun Wukong from his blind spot using Shukuchi, Sun Wukong would use his illusionary and transformation magic skill to hide himself, and then hit Vivasvat from behind with Ruyi Bang.Vivasvat could not even touch Sun Wukong. It was an utter defeat and humiliation for Vivasvat. \u2018How\u2026 How come I can\u2019t get even a single hit in?\u2019 Vivasvat could not understand how he was being so thoroughly routed. Although he was not thinking of defeating Sun Wukong, Vivasvat had been confident that he would be able to at least put up a fight against him. Vivasvat had thought that, if he could put up a formidable performance, perhaps Sun Wukong would consider divulging the whereabouts of his father.However, as soon as the fight started, and the moment he had his head slapped silly, Vivasvat instantly realized that his initial thoughts and expectations were all in vain.\u201cHave you heard of that one saying?\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to say\u2026!\u201d\u201cEveryone has a plausible plan\u2026until one gets hit.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhile I was contemplating that saying, I got another idea.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat would happen if one didn\u2019t just get hit but was slapped silly?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cSo, let\u2019s go!\u201dBam! Bam! Bam! Bam!How long did the beatdown last? At some point, Vivasvat felt like the world was spinning.Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!\u201cAck\u2026 No\u2026!\u201dBam! Bam! Bam! Bam!\u201cI need to know where my father is\u2026!\u201dBam! Bam! Bam! Bam!\u201cNo\u2026!\u201dVivasvat tried to hold on. He was determined to not lose his mind. If he were to lose his consciousness now, Vivasvat knew that he would find himself in front of his mother when he regained his consciousness. If that were to happen, Vivasvat was sure that he would not have an opportunity to look for his father again.Thus, Vivasvat clung on to Sun Wukong to not lose his consciousness. No matter what, Vivasvat was determined to find the whereabouts of his father. However, this was much easier said than done. It was already straining Vivasvat to the limit to maintain consciousness.Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!\u201cHey! This should be enough, so get off me. I don\u2019t like males clinging onto me! I don\u2019t swing that way!\u201dBam! Bam! Bam! Bam!\u201cHey, get off me\u2026!\u201dBam! Bam! Bam! Bam!\u201cArgh! You\u2019re driving me crazy!\u201dFortunately for Vivasvat, as time passed, Sun Wukong grew tired. Though he was excited to beat up his opponent in the beginning, that excitement could only last to a certain extent. Though Sun Wukong had stated that he would stop beating Vivasvat up, Vivasvat did not let go of Sun Wukong. Now, Sun Wukong was feeling frustrated and angry.If it was an enemy, Sun Wukong would have already annihilated his opponent. However, he could not do that to this child. If he inflicted a wound on Vivasvat beyond what he dished out, Sun Wukong knew that he would later get an earful from the Heavenly Demon. Slowly, Sun Wukong began to grow tired.Huff! Huff! Huff!\u00a0Breathing heavily, Sun Wukong tiredly looked at Vivasvat.\u201cIt\u2019s still\u2026a long way\u2026before it\u2019s over\u2026!\u201d It would not have been strange if Vivasvat collapsed immediately. His two eyes had been bruised black, and his entire body was covered in dust. One would scoff at the idea that such a being had moments ago defeated an elder god and blew away an entire planet with a single gesture. Regardless, Vivasvat trudged onward. His eyes, which shone through his shaggy and ragged hair, were still sharp and full of conviction.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201d Sun Wukong sighed heavily and ran his hand through his hair as he could not see an end to this tireless beatdown. Then, with narrowed eyes, he asked, \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201dVivasvat\u2019s reaction was incomprehensible to Sun Wukong. Vivasvat was the son of two beings who could be said to be the most important and precious existences in the vast, entire universe. Vivasvat had won the lottery of lotteries and could awaken as a god whenever he wished. Why was such a being living with such hardships? Why not just live a comfortable life?At first, Sun Wukong thought that the young boy was excited having wind in his lungs and was simply being ostentatious, but looking back on it now, it seemed that his initial assessment was not necessarily the case. There was a deep-seated emotion behind Vivasvat\u2019s actions. It was a very dark, deep emotion.\u2018What the hell happened to you?\u2019 That thought was stuck in Sun Wukong\u2019s mind.Noticing that Sun Wukong had momentarily stopped, Vivasvat thought that Sun Wukong would now listen to him properly, so Vivasvat squeaked out a few words. \u201cThere is something I really want to ask my father.\u201d\u201cYou want to ask him something?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to ask him?\u201dIn response to Sun Wukong\u2019s question, Vivasvat shut his mouth tightly. He was unwilling to divulge his inner thoughts. No matter what happened, Vivasvat would never divulge his question.Sun Wukong felt the sudden urge to slam this stubborn young kid\u2019s head once more, but then he shook his head. He knew well that no matter what he said, the kid\u2019s stubbornness would never be broken.\u2018How is it that this kid is a spitting image of his father\u2026 Ugh! This father and son pair are both bullying me!\u2019 Conveniently forgetting what he did to the Bull Demon King during his own youth, Sun Wukong finally put away the Ruyi Bang in his hands. \u2018I\u2019m going to get an earful from Jiho. I need to avoid his wife for the time being as well.\u2019It was Yama who had asked Sun Wukong to bring back Vivasvat. However, Sun Wukong changed his mind at this moment. He wanted to see for himself what kind of resentment this stubborn kid had and how the kid was going to solve it.\u201cTower.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d The word came out from nowhere, without context. Vivasvat looked at Sun Wukong to try and understand what he meant. Perhaps because he was too focused on a possible incoming fist from Sun Wukong, Vivasvat had not followed along with the context of the conversation.\u201cGo to the Tower.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dSun Wukong waved his hand lightly in the air. An effect fell on Vivasvat\u2019s head, and soon, all Vivasvat\u2019s wounds were healed at once. It was an amazing skill, but Vivasvat had no time to think about such things.\u201cIs my father really there?\u201d\u201cYour father is not there.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026?\u201d\u201cYour father is the one who built that damn Tower.\u201dPound! Pound!\u00a0Vivasvat\u2019s heart raced after hearing about his father. This was the first substantial information that he had come across regarding his father\u2019s whereabouts, which Vivasvat had been tirelessly searching for.Sun Wukong kept his arms crossed and continued his explanation in an annoyed tone. \u201cAnd to clear up a misunderstanding, your father is absolutely not avoiding you. It\u2019s just that he has his hands full with other things at the moment.\u201dThese were completely unexpected words for Vivasvat, who widened his eyes in surprise. \u201cOh, has father gotten injured or something\u2026?\u201d\u201cHahaha! What? Is your father hurt? In this universe? Who the hell would be able to do that? If there\u2019s anyone who can do that, please introduce me to that being. What I would give to see that smug guy have his head cracked open.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s fallen asleep.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026 \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0\u2026 Goddammit! What \u2018leaking the profound secrets of the heavens\u2019 did I say to be censored? Ugh\u2026!\u201dVivasvat could not understand Sun Wukong\u2019s explanation as sudden, static-like noise seemed to disrupt his voice. Sun Wukong was thoroughly indignant at the fact that he was disturbed, but Vivasvat was able to reclaim his calm.Leaking the profound secrets of the heavens\u2026 Among the legends surrounding divine beings, there were some legends that were considered taboos for the wider public, as it may cause chaos and confusion. These taboos were protected by the law of causality and could never be disclosed. Thus, by having his words censored, it meant that the reason why Vivasvat\u2019s father was asleep was shrouded by a great secret.\u2018What could possibly\u2026!\u2019 Vivasvat could not understand what was going on. Judging by Sun Wukong\u2019s words, it seemed that even he, Sun Wukong, who was considered the strongest among the many faces of the Heavenly Demon, could not do anything for Vivasvat\u2019s father\u2026 What the hell happened to Vivasvat\u2019s father?\u2018First\u2026 If I go to the Tower and do some digging around, I should be able to find something.\u2019 Since he found a clue about his father, Vivasvat was determined to act immediately. With that thought, Vivasvat recalled the messages he had received earlier and pinned them at the top of his status window.[Another \u2018Invitation to the Tower\u2019 has been received. Do you agree?][Accepted.][The invitation process shall begin.]Whoosh!\u00a0Vivasvat\u2019s entire body was immersed in light for a moment. Just before being sucked in somewhere, Vivasvat thanked Sun Wukong. \u201cThank you for your help.\u201dSun Wukong, as if he felt annoyed to utter another word to Vivasvat, shook his hand lightly and turned his body in the opposite direction.\u201cCan I ask you one more thing?\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to ask this time?\u201d\u201cIf I climb to the top of the Tower, will I become as strong as you?\u201dInitially, Sun Wukong had an expression of thorough annoyance, but after hearing Vivasvat\u2019s question, Sun Wukong widened his eyes, as if he had been asked a question he had never thought of. Then he smiled lightly and shrugged his shoulders. \u201cHow can a kid like you become like me? It would take you at least a million years.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that I need to invest that amount of time, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026What? Ha! This brazen bastard!\u201d Sun Wukong smirked. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ll be fooling around in the meantime?\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you spend a million years\u2026you\u2019ll probably be able to put up a bit of a fight.\u201d\u201cI see. Thank you.\u201d Vivasvat smiled lightly and lowered his head.And then\u2026\u00a0Poof!\u00a0Along with a burst of light, Vivasvat completely disappeared.Sun Wukong was left all alone. He had his arms crossed as he shook his head. \u201cUgh. I don\u2019t know anymore. You two should clean up your own messy internal quarrels.\u201d Sun Wukong disappeared after murmuring the words to himself.***Since the start of the tutorial, Vivasvat has caused a sensation. Since he was already able to deal with gods easily, the tutorials and lower floor sections designed to match the level of mortal heroes did not offer him much of a challenge. As a result, he recorded overwhelming results on every floor.These feats and facts spread rapidly through the various godly and demonic societies in the heavenly world.\u201cA player named Vivasvat? Ah, you\u2019re talking about the guy who passed the tutorial with overwhelming grades?\u201d\u201cHmpf! Such an arrogant being who dares to use the same name as Deva\u2019s sun god!\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 I heard that he might become a god soon.\u201d\u201cIs he really that talented?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s such a shortage of talented people these days\u2026 If that player really is that talented, you should bring him by.\u201dAs things were rapidly occurring all around him, Vivasvat was more focused on the world spread out in the Tower than anything else. \u2018I wonder\u2026 The dragons and giants\u2026 Existences I thought were extinct still exist in this place.\u2019The world of the Tower could already be called another new universe in itself. Each of the floors had a stage that was so huge that it was impossible to guess the floor\u2019s boundaries, and the beings that flowed in and out of these floors were living in different complex societies.However, this reality also brought up many questions. Weren\u2019t all these divine beings referred to as absolute beings in their respective legends? Among them were some beings who Vivasvat never found or located in the outside world, even though Vivasvat had traveled to so many universes to find them.No matter how wide the world of the Tower was, it was inevitably very cramped to be able to accommodate all the beings who once ruled over the entire universe. Thus, Vivasvat could not help but think\u2026\u2018It\u2019s like they\u2019ve all been locked up here on purpose\u2026\u2019 Thus, instead of slaying the gods right away, Vivasvat tried to find out why they had been imprisoned in the Tower. One had to know one\u2019s opponent and his possible weaknesses to formulate a plan.Even for Vivasvat, it would be suicidal to charge the hundreds of thousands of societies within the Tower. No matter how deep his resentment towards transcendent beings, Vivasvat was not foolish enough to lose his sensibility.\u2018Or I could just avoid them altogether until I meet father\u2026\u2019 In any case, Vivasvat hid his skills as much as possible and only performed as an outstanding rookie player, and soon after, he was able to resolve some of his questions. The reasons were simpler than he initially thought. \u2018They were imprisoned in this place by father.\u2019All beings, from divine gods and demons to dragons and giants all detested the existence of the \u2018Heavenly Demon\u2019. What would happen to Vivasvat if they were to ever find out that the Heavenly Demon\u2019s blood flowed in him? Just thinking about it in this way, Vivasvat felt a chill run down his spine. \u2018\u2026I\u2019ll have to be careful.\u2019That was the first decision Vivasvat made in the Tower.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A visit from the Heavenly Demon\u2019s son. Sun Wukong has done a truly worthless deed.\u201d In a dark place, a goblin in a suit with a monocle in one eye reviewed numerous screens that were floating in front of him. He was Yvlke, the first and oldest Guardian who had existed since the creation of the Tower. Everything regarding the goblin\u2019s background was shrouded in secrecy.Recently, Yvlke was focusing his attention on the player whose real name was \u2018Son Jae-Won\u2019. All the data of players entering the Tower were stored separately in the Tower\u2019s cloud system. Although the Tower\u2019s cloud system was managed with a strict security system that did not allow anyone to access it, the top Guardian, Yvlke, was an exception.Thus, Yvlke knew that Vivasvat shared the same bloodline as the Heavenly Demon, the entity that Yvlke hated yet also wanted to become close to. No, before checking on the cloud system, Yvlke already \u2018intuitively\u2019 knew Vivasvat\u2019s background when he met him in the tutorial. Checking the player\u2019s data in the cloud system was just for confirmation. Moreover, as if to prove his royal bloodline, Vivasvat showed an outstanding, exceptional performance that no one had ever seen before.Throughout all this, Yvlke noticed early on that Vivasvat was hiding the extent of his skills and powers. Of course, Yvlke had no intention of exposing this fact to the outside world. Even if he did not know Vivasvat\u2019s ultimate purpose or goal, Yvlke was not going to miss this interesting sight.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a good opportunity to see what the hell the Heavenly Demon is up to.\u201dEven if nothing was revealed, it was clear that Vivasvat\u2019s presence would cause some fuss in the Tower, where there was not a single day of silence with so many transcendent beings vying for something or another. Yvlke knew that there was nothing more terrifying than a teenage kid acting out his pubescent angst and dissatisfaction against his parents.\u201cOhyohyo, Ohyohyo!\u201d Yvlke\u2019s laughter echoed through the dark interior of the Central Bureau\u2019s Administrative office.***Vivasvat was showered with interest from the heavenly world, lower world associations, and various guilds. He had made quite the name for himself as a super rookie player.\u201cCome to Olympus. Then, I promise to place you at the top seat.\u201dAfter bringing down Kronos, Olympus was in the process of forming a new organization under the three existing Olympian gods.\u201cI sense the aura of a leader from you. Additionally, your name has a relationship to our past.\u201dThere was an Olympian elder named Vivasvat, who was once also a part of Deva.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to learn the true aesthetics and nature of death? Come to us.\u201dMemphis called out to Vivasvat as well.\u201cHahaha! There\u2019s nothing wrong with being a demon. Do you have any desires? Let me make your desires a reality.\u201dThere were love calls from L\u2019Infernal and Niflheim as well. Other than these major heavenly world societies, various other godly and demonic societies, large and small, all attempted to connect with Vivasvat. Also\u2026\u201cDo you yearn to fight? I can see it in your eyes. If you feel this way, I think we would be the best fit for you.\u201dThe place that Vivasvat ultimately chose was a surprise to everyone: Asgard. It was a place where infinite, perpetual fighting was the supreme value, and a place that always prepared for the ultimate war in the great prophecy, the \u2018Twilight of the Gods (Ragnar\u00f6k)\u2019. \u2018I can continue to develop my skills here.\u2019As soon as Vivasvat entered the Tower, the first thing he felt was that he could not freely act as he did in the outside world. There were just too many strong divine beings. If he happened to make any missteps, there was a high chance that he would die before even having the chance to meet his father.Though Vivasvat felt that he made the right choice in choosing Asgard, he was not completely at ease.\u2018It\u2019s the same here\u2026 Just like the outside world.\u2019Could it be that the fate of mortals under the rule of transcendent beings was inevitable? The sights Vivasvat had seen since coming into this universe flashed past his eyes. As he saw the many sights of mortals succumbing to divine beings, Vivasvat could not help but feel a pain in his heart.Asgard treated mortals much more harshly than the other heavenly world societies. It was in Asgard where developing players with excellent power were treated as kings while those who did not rise to the top were all treated as beings that were inferior to slaves.\u2018As long as one has skill and power, one can move up the ranks faster\u2026 So it\u2019ll be easier for me to get to the central leadership of the society.\u2019 Vivasvat planned to win the favor of Asgard soon and ultimately enter \u2018Valhalla\u2019. \u2018Once I become an Einheri, I\u2019ll be able to gather more information on Odin\u2019s state.\u2019Einheri, meaning \u2018one who fights alone\u2019 or \u2018one who cannot die\u2019, was the highest honor an Asgard warrior could attain. The Einheri only followed the instructions of Odin, the main god of Asgard. They had such high powers and positions that even other society\u2019s gods could not treat an Einheri rudely.Valhalla was the hall where such Einheri were gathered, so Vivasvat intended to enter Valhalla and confirm Odin\u2019s condition, as Odin had not made a public appearance in a very long time.\u2018Based on the circulating rumors, it seems that something critical is happening behind the scenes.\u2019Vivasvat had heard that Odin had fallen asleep due to something called the Heavenly Demon disease. Not only that, but rumors had spread among the mortals in the lower world that a significant number of the main divine beings of each heavenly world society had been forced into a deep sleep after they used up their powers to attack the Heavenly Demon, who had imprisoned them in the Tower.Of course, the heavenly world societies did not say much about this topic, so many players and beings within the Tower dismissed the rumors as just fanciful thoughts. However, Vivasvat had a slightly different idea. \u2018It makes sense. Based on father\u2019s personality and temper, he would definitely target all the annoying guys first so that they can\u2019t talk anymore.\u2019 It was a conclusion that could only be drawn from someone who knew the true character and personality of the Heavenly Demon.Therefore, by choosing to join Asgard, Vivasvat was not only preparing to develop his skills but also quickly rise through Asgard\u2019s ranks.\u2018I was told that someone would come to get me. How come they\u2019re so late?\u2019 Since the promised time had passed, Vivasvat could not help but grimace, as no one showed up to the meeting spot. Could it be that something went wrong and that his admission into Asgard was rejected? As he thought that this might be the case, Vivasvat was about to come up with some alternative options\u2026\u201cUgh! Oh! He really is here. You!\u00a0Hiccup!\u00a0Are you the player named Vivasvat?\u00a0Hiccup!\u201d A woman suddenly spoke to Vivasvat with a reddened face.Vivasvat frowned. The woman must have been drinking alcohol during broad daylight, as the smell of alcohol drenched the surrounding air and pierced his nose. She even held a large glass bottle in one hand. \u2018What the hell is this\u2026!\u2019 Vivasvat could not help but feel taken aback by the situation.However, whether she knew what he was thinking or not, the woman started poking and prodding Vivasvat all over while chuckling. \u201cEven though you look small like a dwarf, your muscles are quite strong and developed. Oh, there\u2019s calluses on your hands too. You must have had a relatively easy childhood? Even your face is nice and handsome\u2026 Hey, you\u2019re my type.\u201dVivasvat could not stand the woman\u2019s smiles and giggles. Suppressing his displeasure, Vivasvat asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cMe? Uhm\u2026? Have you gotten the news? You\u2019re being assigned to a unit immediately, so I was sent to come get you.\u201d\u201cThen you\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. My name is Garmr. I\u2019m your direct superior, so let\u2019s work well together.\u201d Garmr extended her hand toward Vivasvat. However, since she constantly swayed because she could not control her body, Vivasvat could only stare at the wavering hand.Vivasvat was torn as to whether he should grab Garmr\u2019s hand or not. From the looks of it, it seemed that this Garmr was going to be his direct superior and the commander of the unit he would have to serve before rising through the society\u2019s ranks\u2026 Vivasvat was unsure whether he could trust the woman in front of him. \u2018A person who has been drinking in broad daylight and openly made inappropriate comments to a subordinate\u2026 It\u2019s hard for me to place any faith in her.\u2019If it was any other occasion, Vivasvat would have gotten up from his seat and walked away without having another thought. Even if Asgard possessed something that he wanted, it was not as if Vivasvat could not find another society with a main god suffering from the Heavenly Demon disease. Although it would take time to rise through any society\u2019s ranks, Vivasvat was confident that he could one day reach the upper levels no matter where he decided to go. However, the reason why Vivasvat did not immediately leave\u2026\u2018There\u2019s something in her eyes.\u2019Though Garmr\u2019s eyes were arced, as she was smiling broadly, and even though her eyes were bloodshot red from drinking, there was a deepness in her eyes. Vivasvat knew that this meant she possessed a tremendous amount of inner strength and power. This observation and realization made it difficult for Vivasvat to leave.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSo, while Vivasvat was mulling over what he should do\u2026\u201cYou don\u2019t want to come? I guess there\u2019s nothing I can do about that.\u201dAs Garmr was about to pull her hand away with a sullen face, Vivasvat quickly caught her retreating hand. He said, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t change my mind. I was just a little preoccupied with other thoughts. Yes, let\u2019s work hard and well together.\u201dSmile!\u00a0Garmr laughed out loud once more. The stench of alcohol drenched the surrounding air once more, and Vivasvat once again contemplated whether he should back out from joining Asgard.***[This is the eleventh floor, the Gate to the Dream World.]\u201cSo, the fact that the Olympians were forced to take the scraps from the beginner section below the tenth floor was all thanks to my performance\u2026!\u201d\u2018I\u2019ve lost count on how many times she\u2019s repeated the same story. Where the hell is this city called Kuram?\u2019In Vivasvat\u2019s eyes, Garmr seemed to have an unreliable personality. She constantly wanted to retell stories of her prosperous years \u2018back in my day\u2019. Vivasvat wondered if even those stories could be trusted to be true.Based on Garmr\u2019s retelling, ten years ago, there was a very big clash between Asgard and Olympus, where Asgard obtained a big victory, which ultimately forced Olympus to recruit players in the beginner\u2019s area, from the tenth floor and below. The beginner area did not present many interesting opportunities. On the other hand, Asgard was able to acquire a vast area, and the ability to recruit from the eleventh to the thirtieth floor.Also based on Garmr\u2019s retelling, the deciding factor that tipped the scales towards Asgard\u2019s favor was all thanks to the performance of Garmr and her unit \u2018Bifrost\u2019, in which she was the commander\u2026Vivasvat let her words go into one ear and out the other. If he responded to her, Vivasvat knew that there would be no end to her story. However, though one could possibly ignore something if it was told once or twice, with the sheer number of times Garmr brought up the story, Vivasvat could not help but memorize the entire story down to the nitty gritty details.\u2018Anyway\u2026\u2019 Vivasvat ignored Garmr, who was trying to go back and retell her story once more and focused on their surroundings. \u2018\u2026even though it\u2019s a mess here, it\u2019s a bit too messy.\u2019Vivasvat knew that Asgard had a particularly strong disregard for mortals in comparison to other societies, but the moment he saw the disheveled and messy situation, his anger naturally started piling up.Possessing an innumerable number of mythical beasts, the eleventh floor boasted a very beautiful stage. Furthermore, there were many outstanding resources on the floor, so many \u2018slaves\u2019 could be seen in every part of the floor. On the arable farmlands, skinny farmers were tirelessly plowing the land. With the danger of not knowing when an explosion would occur, people were constantly being put into a mine to bring out each mine\u2019s resources. In one village, Vivasvat even saw people trying to forcibly drag a young child away from his family, saying that they were conscripting soldiers.In all these scenes of abuse, low-level gods and servants, who all seemed to be affiliated with Asgard, were tightly intertwined. To see such lowly ranked Asgard affiliates act like kings in front of the weak\u2026 If Vivasvat had not made a firm commitment to control his temper before meeting his father, he would have already blown up.\u2018Sorry\u2026 Just a bit longer\u2026 Please wait and be patient a bit longer.\u2019Persecution and exploitation. Oppression and violence. The world of the Tower was a savage world where only the law of strong over the weak prevailed. It was like a house of maggots\u2026 If things continued down this path, Vivasvat was certain that something explosive would occur. Vivasvat even thought that he would probably have to flip everything upside down and tear down the entire Tower\u2026\u2018Father\u2026 What were you thinking when you created this place? I have no clue.\u2019What was the significance of this Tower\u2019s existence? If his father simply needed a prison to keep the damned transcendent beings all in one place, the Heavenly Demon could have just imprisoned the divine beings. Why did he have to bring mortals into the Tower with an \u2018invitation\u2019? Vivasvat felt his heart become heavier the more he thought about it, and the more he thought, the more he sighed.\u201c\u2026At that critical moment, I stood up and then\u2026 Huh? Hey, are you listening to me?\u201dAs soon as Vivasvat suddenly stopped, Garmr stopped her nonstop chattering and frowned as she looked towards Vivasvat. She did not know why Vivasvat was exhibiting such abnormal behavior. Then, she noticed that Vivasvat\u2019s gaze was fixed on a field in the distance.There was a being named Grani in that field. He possessed a cruel personality, as he liked to bully the weak and torture his prisoners. Garmr did not care much for Grani. Still, he possessed some unique skills, and his background was great, so people around Grani could not treat him badly. Grani was about to whip a girl who had fallen to the ground. Judging by Grani\u2019s stained clothes and the intense anger on his face, it seemed that the girl had made some mistake and was about to be punished for it. It would be impossible for any mortal human to survive such a whipping.\u2018This guy, is he really planning on jumping into the fray?\u2019As if attempting to save the girl, Vivasvat was about to extend a helping hand. The coldness in his eyes were so sharp that Garmr could not help but feel her drunkenness instantly disappear.\u00a0Bam!\u00a0Garmr reflexively grabbed onto Vivasvat\u2019s wrist.Vivasvat\u2019s sharp gaze turned toward Garmr. \u201cLet go of this hand.\u201dRespectful, but obviously a warning. Garmr could make out a hint of murderous killing intent in Vivasvat\u2019s eyes. Of course, the killing intent was pointed towards Grani. Realizing this, Garmr could not let go of Vivasvat\u2019s hand. With a distorted expression, she asked Vivasvat, \u201cIf I don\u2019t let you go, what will you do?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The ice clinked together.\u201cYou.\u201d\u201cYes, Father.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did you find another girl?\u201dYeon-woo stared at Kronos for a moment.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dA heavy silence filled the room.\u201c\u2026Wait, so that wasn\u2019t a joke, Father?\u201d Yeon-woo made a dumbfounded face seeing Kronos\u2019 solemn gaze.However, Kronos was still serious. He said, \u201cSon, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking, but loyalty is part of love. How could you toss away a girl who\u2019s waited for you for so long\u2026.!\u201d\u201cFather.\u201d\u201cYes, son.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re going to say nonsense, you can go to Timbuktu and do it.\u201dKronos scratched his cheek awkwardly. \u201c\u2026So you didn\u2019t find someone else?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want Edora pulling my hair out. Also, I don\u2019t need any other woman.\u201d\u201cThen how\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhere else would I use my ability to turn back the wheel?\u2019\u201cOh\u2026? Right.\u201d\u201cMother. Father\u2019s thinking in such an old-fashioned way now that he\u2019s retired.\u201d\u201cIndeed. He keeps on forgetting things these days. You should be understanding, Yeon-woo. I think his hair is starting to become thinner too\u2026\u201dKronos burst up at Rhea\u2019s sigh. \u201cWhat?! My hair\u2019s fine!\u201d\u201cShould I look for a good hair growth cream?\u201d\u201cI can do that myself!\u201d\u201cThey say angry outbursts mean you\u2019re subconsciously thinking it\u2019s true\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201dYeon-woo and Rhea continued to tease Kronos for a while after that. Kronos had a sullen face, and Rhea smiled as she looked at him like he was adorable. Looking at his parents, the faint trace of a smile appeared on Yeon-woo\u2019s face. This was the kind of relationship he wanted.Yeon-woo began to speak of the reason why he decided to get married, and Kronos stayed sour, but he brightened upon hearing of the girl he had taken a liking to. Rhea chimed in occasionally with \u201creally\u201d and \u201coh, my,\u201d curious about the daughter-in-law she hadn\u2019t met yet. She had only heard about Edora from Kronos, so she was most curious.\u201cSo I think we\u2019ll have to have a meeting between the parents.\u201d\u201cOh my! Honey, we\u2019re going to have a meeting between parents. So exciting.\u201dRhea giggled like a young girl. They\u2019d had many children, but they had never attended their children\u2019s weddings. Kronos had become absorbed by Demonisms before that could happen, and he was chased away from the throne by Zeus. And after he was resurrected, he had Yeon-woo and Jeong-woo, but Jeong-woo had already met Ananta, so they had no opportunity. They didn\u2019t have any in-laws with Ananta either.Yeon-woo\u2019s marriage was very new to both Rhea and Kronos. It was something that was natural for others. Kronos smiled wryly at the fact that they hadn\u2019t been able to enjoy such pleasures. He was apologetic toward Rhea, seeing her so happy.\u201cThen, the in-laws\u2026 It\u2019ll just be the Psychic Medium?\u201d Kronos trailed off at \u201cin-laws\u201d because of how awkward it fell off his tongue.\u201cNo. Seseung-nim will come too.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026?\u201d Kronos didn\u2019t understand when he heard \u201cSeseung.\u201d He soon widened his eyes. \u201cBut that man is\u2026!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s alive.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Kronos knew that the Martial King had awakened as an emperor, then was scattered because of Gaia\u2019s Curse\u2026 Then, Kronos came to a realization. \u201cYou did something.\u201dYeon-woo looked up, and Kronos and Rhea followed his gaze. They were looking at the second-floor banister, where Min Chae-young was. Yeon-woo said, \u201cI saw the ghost girl a moment ago, and the energy I felt from her was familiar.\u201d\u201cFamiliar?\u201dYeon-woo nodded at Kronos\u2019 question. \u201cThat child has something called the \u2018star fragment,\u2019 doesn\u2019t she?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dKronos and Rhea widened their eyes.\u201cSo she does.\u201d Kronos collected his bearings first. \u201cSo this is related to the Martial King\u2026 I mean our in-law?\u201dYeon-woo nodded. \u201cThe star fragments are pieces of Seseung-nim\u2019s soul that he left behind after he ascended.\u201dKronos and Rhea finally understood why creatures outside of their domain of perception were able to exist. In Kronos\u2019 memory, the Martial King was a monster. He was a monster of monsters who\u2019d destroyed Asgard alone and become an emperor solely with his will. If there was no such thing as a system in the Tower, Allforone would never have been able to handle him. The same went for the other beings of the heavenly world.The Martial King was an outlier who was so powerful even the former god of kings didn\u2019t know what his limits were. The pieces left behind when such a being became an emperor\u2026\u2018Merely possessing a piece could make you into a monster.\u2019 Kronos had only met three stars, but each of them was as powerful as a beast. It made sense since they were beings who swallowed all the legends in a world line after erasing it, but it made even better sense after hearing it was pieces of the Martial King that allowed such evolution to occur.\u201cThen\u2026what happens to that child?\u201d Kronos looked at Yeon-woo anxiously. There were only two paths a being with a star fragment could take. They could either be eaten by another star who crossed over from another world line, or they could completely digest the fragment and become a true star.If Yeon-woo declared he\u2019d forcefully retrieve the fragment from Min Chae-young, there was no way to stop him, even if it meant Min Chae-young would get hurt in the process. Kronos and Rhea would probably attempt to stop him, since they now thought of her as a daughter despite only having known her for a short while\u2026Yeon-woo made a disbelieving face after reading Kronos\u2019 expression. \u201c\u2026Father, I\u2019m not that reckless.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cWhat exactly do you think of me?\u201d\u201cEmperor Temper?\u201d\u201cHasn\u2019t it ever occurred to you that the temper\u2019s genetic?\u201d\u201cApologize now.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about\u2026?!\u201d\u201cHow dare you speak to your mother that way when she\u2019s sacrificed everything for you both?\u201dYeon-woo looked at Kronos with an appalled face, as if he was questioning Kronos\u2019 conscience, and Rhea shook her head at her preposterous husband.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not that difficult to retrieve the fragments. I\u2019ve already collected a few on the way here.\u201d\u201cWhat about the stars?\u201d\u201cI met them.\u201d\u201cHow pitiful for them.\u201d\u201cBut a few are definitely not to be disregarded. There are some that have even left the universe and the world lines.\u201d\u201cOutside? Are you talking about the otherworld? I\u2019m talking about Night here.\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s a bit different\u2026 Mm, it\u2019s kind of hard to explain.\u201d A thought occurred to Yeon-woo mid-sentence, and he suddenly turned his head. \u201cIt\u2019ll be easier for you to hear for yourself.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dKronos and Rhea were about to ask him what that meant when Yeon-woo suddenly dashed forward.Flash!* * *\u2018\u2026Dim-witted Darkness! I had my doubts, but why is he\u2026?!\u201dThere was a thing called the Unreal World. Just as there were two sides to a coin, there was another side to the existing reality. It originated from the eggshell Pangu had come from. It was a world that wanted to become real but could never attain that dream.Stars had the ability to enter and exit this Unreal World. This world was also the third zone the Heavenly Demon had mentioned.Tigris was currently hiding in the Unreal World, looking at what was reflected through the mirror. This was how they weren\u2019t able to be caught by beings like Kronos and Rhea until now. He was carefully observing Kronos and Rhea through the Unreal World to somehow kidnap Min Chae-young to this place as soon as the opportunity arose\u2026 But then, he\u2019d seen something unexpected\u2014the ego of the Dim-witted Darkness, the Black King!Along with the Heavenly Demon, also known as the Sacred Light, the Black King was considered to be someone who was a top priority to avoid. A few of Tigris\u2019 companions had been erased after accidentally coming into contact with the Black King.It seemed the Heavenly Demon still hadn\u2019t caught onto their presence because he was cooped up in the Changgong Library, but the Black King was currently retrieving star fragments, so they needed to take special care.Tigris attempted to leave right away. A part of him wanted to stay and observe Yeon-woo a while longer, but he didn\u2019t want to be a cat that died from curiosity. \u2018Thankfully, I haven\u2019t heard anything about the Black King being able to touch the Unreal World yet\u2026!\u2019Fortunately, the Black King himself was the universe and the world. That meant it was impossible for him to interfere in the Unreal World.However, Tigris wasn\u2019t able to continue his thoughts any longer. The space in front of him suddenly divided, and a strong force suddenly began to pull his body.\u00a0Crash!\u00a0Before he could resist, Tigris was sucked forward like his collars were tightly being held by someone.\u201cKegh!\u201d When Tigris came to, he paled. Yeon-woo was looking down at him from right in front of him. The moment Tigris saw those pitch-black eyes, he trembled in fear, unable to utter anything. Like a mouse in front of a snake, all his instincts were telling him not to clash with the being in front of him.\u201cIf I can\u2019t interfere in your world, all I have to do is force you over here. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d Tigris\u2019 mind went blank after seeing Yeon-woo\u2019s cold smile. Yeon-woo\u2019s smirk only deepened. \u201cYou know why I brought you here, right? You can start talking now.\u201dNod.\u00a0Tigris nodded frantically in case Yeon-woo suddenly decided to kill him. To live, he needed to ask \u201chow high\u201d if he was ordered to jump.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He continued to pose like he was competing in a bodybuilder competition. The muscles beneath his copper skin squirmed like keys on a piano.Clap clap clap!\u00a0The dolls and statues clapped wildly like they were fans who were meeting their favorite star. They weren\u2019t able to cheer because they lacked vocal cords, but some of them gestured as if they were shouting.What was Sesha supposed to do with that attention-seeking pervert? She wanted to find a hole and hide. If someone else saw him\u2026!\u201c\u2026So-yeong?\u201d At the sudden voice, Sesha straightened her back like a cat and turned around. Park Yoo-min was looking at the pervert bunny and ghosts with a mystified expression.\u2018O-Oh right\u2026\u2019 Sesha had forgotten about it because of the pervert bunny, but Park Yoo-min was very fearless for a normal human being, and she was a very curious person. While Sesha had the upper hand over others, in front of Park Yoo-min, she was always the weaker one. She had been victim to Yoo-min\u2019s mischief too many times to count.\u201cThat guy\u2026!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know him!\u201d\u201cWhat? But your shadow\u2014\u201d\u201cHa, hahaha. I-I-I d-don\u2019t know what you\u2019re t-talking about. Y-Y-You must be s-s-seeing things. Ha, ha, haha.\u201d Before Park Yoo-min could say anything, Sesha quickly cut her off. Then, she began to ramble like a mindless robot. She was incredulous at how bad her own acting was.\u2018I\u2019m done for. My life is over because of that pervert bunny.\u2019 Sesha\u2019s heart sank as she saw Yoo-min\u2019s eyes narrow. Park Yoo-min\u2019s expression was full of interest and amusement, and it was when she was making faces like these that she was scariest. No matter what excuse Sesha made, it wouldn\u2019t work.\u300eSob, sob.\u300fThe pervert bunny was fanning the blazing red flames on top of that. \u300eYou're too cruel, hubby. You said you loved me, but you\u2019re tossing me aside because you\u2019re tired of having me around now?\u300fLaplace put his hands behind his head, showing off the clear lines of his abs while speaking utter nonsense. Listening to him attempt to speak in a high-pitched tone in that low and rough voice\u2026 Sesha felt like she was going to go mad. She yelled, \u201cShut the fuck up!\u201d\u300eSob sob. You\u2019re swearing at me now too? My girlish and delicate heart is hurt.\u300fLaplace\u2019s words weren\u2019t convincing at all with the veins and muscles nearly popping through his skin.\u201cShut up! Who are you calling girlish and delicate?! You look like you chew bones for fun! You don\u2019t even have a gender!\u201d\u300eOh my. This is what an appearance-based society has come to. This girlish heart is pained. I didn\u2019t raise you that way, hubby.\u300f\u201cAhhhhh! Stop calling me \u2018hubby!\u2019\u201d Sesha tore her hair out and shouted.\u201cW-What is that\u2026?\u201d\u201cEeeek! G-Ghosts!\u201d\u201cThere are so many ghosts!\u201d\u201cI-Isn\u2019t that a pervert?\u201dShin Sung-chan and the staff members belatedly ran out into the hallway and turned surprised.After a moment later, Shin Sung-chan gathered his bearings and quickly stepped forward. \u2018I have to save So-yeong!\u2019 His only thought was that these mysterious ghosts might try to harm Sesha. The bald foreigner with bunny ears looked especially dangerous.Dash!\u00a0Shin Sung-chan swallowed and moved in front of Sesha.\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dSesha and Park Yoo-min tilted their heads in confusion.\u201cS-So-yeong! I-I-I\u2019ll block them off, s-s-so run away!\u201d Shin Sung-chan shouted with a tense expression.\u00a0Tremble, tremble.\u00a0His legs wobbled as if he would topple over if left alone. But it was as if Sung-chan was filming some action movie on his own.The problem was that Producer Kim and the other staff were busily recording everything on the cameras. \u201cQuick, roll the cameras! Those things are definitely monsters! This is a rare moment when we can see the Idol fighting up close! We\u2019re going to get a bunch of good scenes!\u201dThere was an apt word for situations like this: shitshow.\u2018I want to cry.\u2019 Sesha covered her face with her hands. She didn\u2019t think she could show her face in public anymore because of the embarrassment. That damned pervert bunny ruined her life. An \u201cIdol\u201d who raised a perverted creature\u2026 She had maintained her indifferent and cold attitude to keep away the people who tried to take advantage of her young age, but it seemed she\u2019d have to change her plans.Just then, Park Yoo-min, who had been looking at Sesha mischievously, started pushing the staff back. \u201cPlease step away, as it can be dangerous.\u201d\u201cHuh? Wait! But we need to film the monsters\u2026!\u201d\u201cDo you want to get hurt? There are even laws that civilians are forbidden from going near raids. You might be penalized for breaking the law\u2026 Is that okay?\u201d\u201cT-That\u2019s\u2026!\u201d\u201cHey! Shin Sung-chan! You come over here too!\u201d\u201cBut So-yeong is\u2026!\u201d\u201cA truckload of you couldn\u2019t protect So-yeong! You\u2019re just getting in the way, so get out of there! Or I\u2019m really not gonna help you anymore!\u201dShin Sung-chan hesitantly looked at Sesha and the statues. But when Park Yoo-min narrowed her eyes, he retreated. Realizing they might become injured by the monsters, the staff also began to move as Yoo-min ordered them to.Park Yoo-min winked at Sesha.\u2018Y-Yoo-min\u2026!\u201d Sesha started to tear up because she was touched.But Yoo-min suddenly began to mouth something.\u00a0Ice cream. One month.\u00a0Yoo-min wasn\u2019t doing this for free.Sesha smiled bitterly. But to be honest, she could buy Yoo-min as much of anything she wanted until she became sick of it.While the people began to return to the music room, Sesha whipped back to Laplace with a glowering expression. \u2018You\u2019re dead, pervert bunny.\u2019Swish!\u00a0Sesha pulled out the weapon her father had gifted her some time ago. The bracelet she always wore on her right arm unraveled like silk and fell to the floor. It was a longsword that was two meters long.This weapon was infamous for being uncontrollable due to its elasticity that made it hard to predict the trajectory. However, Sesha already learned the skills for this weapon from Ananta, and this longsword was made of the same material as her father\u2019s trademark, the Dragon Slayer, which was adept at reading its owner\u2019s intent.That meant others could have trouble using this sword, but for Sesha, it was just an easily-commanded weapon. Today, she was going to dismember that perverted bunny with this sword. With blazing eyes, Sesha flourished the longsword in Laplace\u2019s direction. \u201cDie!\u201dSwish. Kashing, kashing!\u300eEeeeeeee!\u300fA high-pitched scream echoed.* * *\u300eHaa, haa, haa. Please continue to whip me like that. Please, please, please\u2026!\u300f\u201cAhhhh! Go away! Go awaaaay!\u201dUnfortunately, no matter what Sesha did, it didn\u2019t affect Laplace. Rather, Laplace stuck to her, begging her to punish him more, so she struggled with getting him off of her.The dolls and statues all ran away, scared. They escaped into their respective classrooms and peeked out with concern. It seemed they\u2019d become friends with Laplace in that short while.\u300eKyahaha! No need to be so scared! Our little miss Sesha is a great person!\u300fAt that, the statues and dolls peeked out further, but they didn\u2019t dare approach.\u201cHaa, haa, haa\u2026! Dammit!\u201d Sesha gasped for breath and gritted her teeth furiously.\u300eOh my, little miss. How are you so weak?\u300fSesha wanted to slap Laplace properly on the face just once. Laplace winked at the steaming Sesha.\u300eAnyhow, please tell them, little miss. You don\u2019t have any plans of hurting them, right?\u300fSesha frowned. She couldn\u2019t tell what Laplace was trying to do.\u300ePlease, come this way everyone. She may look like this on the outside, but she\u2019s actually quite nice. She\u2019ll play with us.\u300fAt the word \u2018play,\u2019 the statues and dolls brightened. Now, their entire faces were peeking out.Sesha realized what Laplace was saying. \u2018They\u2026just wanted to play?\u2019 Now that she thought about it, she didn\u2019t recall hearing of anyone who was ever hurt in the stories of the school\u2019s mystery. Usually, ghosts held grudges toward humans and tried to harm them. \u2018The statue of King Sejong seemed to be happy to see us at first, then it was upset when we were surprised\u2026\u2019The statues and dolls appeared to be busy playing among themselves. The sounds of the piano weren\u2019t intended to scare people, but it was for the creatures to enjoy while having fun. Laplace was able to easily join them too.Sesha could feel the statues and dolls looking expectantly at her. In particular, the dolls seemed to be looking at her with sparkling eyes, as if asking how she was going to play with them. With all the gazes on her, there was only one thing Sesha could do here. \u00a0\u201c\u2026Haa.\u201d She had come here to solve a mystery\u2026 Sesha sighed.* * *\u2018So these guys just wanted to play?\u2019\u300eHuhuhu. Yes. I\u2019m just playing along with them.\u300f\u2018You seem to be enjoying yourself too much for that.\u2019\u300eGoodness. You should do things properly if you\u2019re going to do them at all.\u300f\u2018Geez! Whatever, shut up and clean up the mess you caused.\u2019\u300eHuhuhu. Your friends are already all asleep. When they wake up, they\u2019ll forget everything that happened here, so don\u2019t worry.\u300fSesha rubbed her throbbing temples. She felt like she aged ten years today because of that smarmy pervert bunny.\u300eYou know you shouldn\u2019t talk about age in front of me, right?\u300fSesha was so tired that she couldn\u2019t even muster the strength to tell Laplace to shut up.Tap tap.\u00a0Sesha turned around with agitation wondering who was trying to bother her this time.The bear doll that was perched on her shoulder jumped in surprise and fell to the ground. Sesha frantically caught the bear. The bear doll smiled in gratitude and held something out. It was a yellow handkerchief.\u201c\u2026For me?\u201dNod nod.\u00a0The bear doll nodded. It seemed like it was telling Sesha to wipe her sweat.\u201cThank you.\u201dShake shake.\u00a0The bear doll shook its head from side to side, saying it was fine, and hopped down to the ground.Sesha felt strange wiping her sweat with the handkerchief the bear doll gave her, but still. \u2018They really are all nice.\u2019Laplace said they should \u201cplay together,\u201d but Sesha hadn\u2019t really done anything. She just let herself be pulled away by the dolls and moved her upper body awkward in front of the dancing statues. But the creatures still enjoyed it a lot.With that, Sesha was able to realize they might seem like they were possessed by ghosts, but they were all very innocent and nice.\u2018And there\u2019s someone who\u2019s pulling the strings from behind.\u2019\u300eIt seems there\u2019s one very vengeful ghost at this school.\u300fLaplace\u2019s voice was solemn unlike before.\u201cA ghost\u2026?\u201d\u300eYes. According to our friends here, the ghost is a victim of bullying. The ghost was tormented by its classmates, and when it became severe, the few friends it had started to avoid it too\u2026 It has a grudge for not being able to play properly at school, so these children all became its friend.\u300f\u201c\u2026\u201d Sesha pressed her lips together. This was something that shouldn\u2019t be glossed over.\u300eThe problem is, although it has many friends now, it still suffers from the trauma from back then and doesn\u2019t come out easily. How about it? Will you meet with this ghost?\u300fSesha immediately nodded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After the \u201cday of the beginning,\u201d there were many people on Earth with pitiful situations, and Sesha always stood on the frontlines listening to their stories. If there was anything she learned, it was that those people shouldn\u2019t be neglected just because you were busy.Moreover, the cause behind this phenomenon was someone who was around Sesha\u2019s age. Her heart went out to the ghost. But strangely, Laplace was grinning widely, as if he was proud of her.\u201c\u2026What? Why are you smiling so pervertedly again?\u201d\u300ePerverted? I\u2019m smiling because I\u2019m veeeeery proud of your pity.\u300f\u201cBeing complimented by you doesn\u2019t make me happy at all.\u201d\u300eHuhuhu! So shy.\u300f\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d\u300eHuhuhu!\u300f\u201cHey!\u201d Sesha only became angrier after hearing the laughter of the pervert bunny.Of course, Laplace didn\u2019t seem affected at all.\u300eThese friends will guide us. Please wait a moment.\u300fHe smiled and began to whisper something to the skeleton and dolls. It was a language Sesha didn\u2019t understand.However, the skeleton and dolls seemed to have understood, because they all made surprised faces\u2015the skeleton just widened its jaw\u2015and waved at Sesha.Rattle, rattle!\u300eThey say this is the first time someone\u2019s been so nice, and that they\u2019re grateful someone so generous is their friend. Huhuhu.\u300f\u201c\u2026I get it. Just tell them to lead the way.\u201d\u300eSo very shy.\u300f\u201cHaa.\u201d\u300eThen friends, please begin.\u300fRattle, rattle!\u00a0The skeleton nodded first and stepped forward. The statues of King Sejong and Yi Sun-sin followed him.\u2018Hm? They\u2019re all coming?\u2019 Didn\u2019t the ghost stay hidden even though it had a lot of friends? Wasn\u2019t it staying hidden because it didn\u2019t like being around too many people? Was it okay to go in a horde like this? Wouldn\u2019t it just hide deeper? All kinds of thoughts filled Sesha\u2019s head. However, she had no choice but to follow them as they pulled her along. The dolls around her legs looked at her expectantly with sparkling eyes, urging her to move.Sesha smiled wryly. Moving statues and a skeleton that was alive was something straight out of a mystery horror story, but with these cute dolls, she was reminded of\u00a0Toy Story.The ghost kid, a victim of school bullying, would probably be nice if these dolls were its friends.\u2018No. This is probably\u00a0Night at the Museum, not\u00a0Toy Story\u2026?\u2019While Sesha followed her train of thought, the skeleton walked forward confidently. They climbed several flights of stairs and passed through hallways to arrive at the third floor, which was mostly used by the second-years.\u2018Was the ghost a second-year?\u2019 Sesha was able to glean more information from Laplace about the ghost as they continued forward.\u300eAccording to our friends here, the ghost has a very pure soul.\u300f\u300eHer name is Min Chae-young.\u300f\u300eOur friends say their standards for beauty are different from humans so they can\u2019t tell, but according to what the other humans said, she was very pretty too. Of course, it was nothing compared to her inner beauty.\u300fWhen the school bell rang at midnight, the ghost always appeared at the same place and moved to a specific classroom. She stayed inside the classroom and only came out when it was six in the morning. It had been several months since she started this routine.This was probably the reason why there were so many witnesses. But the horror stories hadn\u2019t been spread too far because it had been summer vacation and school only started back up recently. However, the statues and dolls agreed that the rumors would become more widespread at this rate.\u300eOur ghost friend was apparently a student who attended this school. But she was always gloomy, so she didn\u2019t have many friends. And the few friends she had were kids who had other intentions in mind. After the bullying started, she practically had no one\u2026 none of the teachers stepped up despite knowing. Even her parents were trash. Her mom remarried, but then she ran away, so Chae-young was left with her step-father\u2026 I suppose it was very hard for her in many aspects.\u300fSesha\u2019s eyes darkened as Laplace continued. \u2018We\u2019re in the twenty-first century too!\u2019 Sesha didn\u2019t usually get mad and could care less about what happened in the world, but everything about Chae-young\u2019s story frustrated her. Chae-young had no one on her side and no one to depend on. The entire world must\u2019ve seemed like a cage to her.Sesha knew too well what that was like. However, at the very least, she had a family. She had her mother and grandfather, to whom she was very grateful, and her dependable father and uncle. Her grandmother too\u2026 They were all the fences who kept her safe. Sesha had been hurt so many times when she was young, but she was able to stand tall again thanks to her family. That was what a family was. A place where you could always come back to rest after being torn and shredded by rough waves and winds.But if your family was the cause of the pain, what were you supposed to do then? That was Min Chae-young\u2019s situation. She probably felt like she was alone in the world without anywhere to depend on. She likely felt like she was pushed toward the edge of a psychological cliff. And in the end, she wasn\u2019t able to take it anymore\u2026A part of Sesha wondered if it was okay for her to be listening to this. This might be a part of Chae-young\u2019s past that she didn\u2019t want to reveal. No, it definitely was. Sesha hadn\u2019t told Park Yoo-min about her past either. Someday\u2026 If a time came when she and Park Yoo-min could share everything, she would do it then. Right now, she couldn\u2019t muster the courage to do so. After all, she didn\u2019t like expressing herself.However, Laplace was very firm in response to Sesha\u2019s question, which was out of character for him.\u300eNo. You must know. Even if you end up forgetting, you need to know a part of it.\u300f\u201cWhy?\u201d\u300eBecause then, you\u2019ll be able to understand.\u300f\u201cUnderstand\u2026?\u201d\u300eDo you remember what I said? About how horror stories come to be.\u300f\u201cYou said peoples\u2019 vestiges come together.\u201d\u300eVestiges are toxic poisons. If they aren\u2019t detoxified, they'll just result in innocent victims. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying you need to understand. Vestiges are created when hate and resentment continue to stack up without being vented anywhere.\u300f\u201c\u2026\u201d\u300eIt might be hypocritical, but those people probably just want to hear kind words and receive warm embraces. Genuine words.\u300f\u201c\u2026That\u2019s true.\u201d\u300eOf course, even if you step up now, you won\u2019t be able to satisfy her grudges. She might even be angry that you know her embarrassing past. Still, you need to hug her. Most people like her are people who wanted to receive help but can\u2019t bring themselves to ask for it.\u300fLaplace\u2019s words were deep and made Sesha think. She nodded and looked at Laplace strangely, which made Laplace chuckle.\u300eHuhuhu. Why are you looking at me like that?\u300f\u201cJust cause. This is the first time you said something normal.\u201d\u300eWhat are you talking about? You won\u2019t find a more normal cute and adorable bunny like me.\u300f\u201cYou mean perverted bunny.\u201d\u300eHaa, haa, haa.\u300f\u201c\u2026\u201d Sesha erased the brownie points she had given Laplace.\u300eOh right, there\u2019s something you must beware of when meeting our ghost friend.\u300f\u201cWhat?\u201d\u300eThere are two, in fact. First, they say she\u2019s scared of thunder and lightning.\u300fSesha nodded but didn\u2019t ask why. The ghost probably had some trauma related to it. \u201cAnd the other?\u201d\u300eThey say it\u2019s as if she\u2019s waiting for someone.\u300f\u201cWho?\u201d\u300eOur friends don\u2019t know. She just sits in the dark room alone, looking outside. She looks like she\u2019s longing for something or waiting for someone to come find her, according to our friends.\u300fSesha nodded silently. She thought the ghost was probably waiting for a friend. The ghost had made the school into a playground because she wanted friends in the first place. It was possible she was waiting for that friend to come back so they could hang out together. \u2018I wonder who it is?\u2019Just then, the skeleton stopped walking. It was class six of the second-years.\u00a0Rattle, rattle!\u00a0The creature shook its hands and feet as if it wanted to say something.Fortunately, Laplace interpreted for the skeleton.\u300eIt says it can\u2019t go in from here.\u300f\u201cWhy?\u201d\u300eShe doesn\u2019t mind when our friends wander around near here, but she hides when they try to meet her. Huhuhu. She must be a shy friend like you.\u300fSesha ignored Laplace because nothing good would come out of refuting him anyway. Instead, she approached the classroom and stood on her toes to peek through the windows of the class. \u2018There she is.\u2019There really was a student wearing a school uniform inside the class. She was a short and lithe child. Her hair was covered with messy short hair that obscured her face. And like Laplace said, she was looking out the window, as if she was waiting for someone.\u2018She looks like any other high schooler. I don\u2019t feel anything from her in particular.\u2019 Sesha thought this ghost might have something special about it since it had managed to hide from Laplace, but she looked just like any other human being. Her paranormal energy was normal too. Rather, she seemed like she would easily be blown away by the wind.Sesha looked at her for a while like that, and the ghost turned to her, feeling her gaze. Sesha flinched in surprise, but she didn\u2019t hide. She wanted to observe the ghost a while longer. However, the ghost uncomfortably tried to get up and disappear.Sesha couldn\u2019t lose the ghost. She quickly opened the door and shouted, \u201cWait!\u201dFlinch.\u00a0The ghost trembled in surprise and looked at Sesha with shaking eyes. She slowly crept behind the desks.\u2018She\u2019s scared of me\u2026\u2019 Sesha realized why the ghost disappeared when statues and dolls approached her. She was scared. She thought the creatures might try to hurt her.Sesha bit her lower lip. The ghost was a grade higher than her, but she was so thin. It was hard to fathom everything she had been through. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you. Really.\u201d\u2026\u201cThere\u2019s just something I want to ask you.\u201d Sesha attempted to take a few steps forward, but she stopped when she saw the ghost slowly inching back. Instead, she tried to persuade her. \u201cI heard you come here every night. Can I ask why?\u201d\u2026\u201cI understand it might be hard for you to talk to me since you\u2019ve never seen me before, but I want to help.\u201d\u2026The ghost was silent for a moment. She just looked at Sesha, ready to escape at a moment\u2019s notice.Sesha just thought it was a relief that the ghost wasn\u2019t escaping. It was their first time meeting anyway. It was more important to slowly close the distance.Plop!\u00a0Sesha sat down on the floor, surprising the ghost. Sesha grinned. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna sit here, so pretend I\u2019m not here and do your thing. Tell me when you want to talk. Okay?\u201d\u2026\u201cThen I\u2019ll take it, you're okay with this. Thanks.\u201dThey had all the time in the world anyway. Sesha intended on staying here the entire night until the ghost opened her mouth. If not today, then tomorrow. If not tomorrow, then the day after that. One month, one year\u2026 If she continued to come to find her like this every day, the ghost would gradually open up. The goodwill of other people was probably foreign to the ghost anyway. Her heart was frozen even to the adorable dolls. To melt, it would require a lot of time.\u2018Good thing I have that spell I learned from Grandpa last time. I can spend time researching that.\u2019 Sesha drew a magic circle in the air and began to fiddle with it.The ghost\u2026 Min Chae-young stared at Sesha. Sesha reminded her of someone who used to come to school at six in the morning and say hi to her.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)\u201cStill, with this, now I have a grasp of what happened.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon nodded at Jeong-woo\u2019s words. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he\u2019d create a trap this way.\u201dThey now knew why Yeon-woo\u2019s records didn\u2019t exist. Everything they\u2019d seen was fake. It was a dream that wasn\u2019t recorded as reality. And because they were untrue, they weren\u2019t recorded in the Changgong Library.\u201cUtilizing the original worldline and a fake dream\u2026 It\u2019s definitely something only the Black King would think of doing.\u201dThe Black King\u2019s dream could cause ripples in other worldlines. It was something that influenced the entire universe, and if he accidentally were to blink his eyes open, it could bring forth the end of the entire world.So Yeon-woo had tried not to show his powers as the Black King too much. However, it was different this time. He moved between the fake dream and the original, acting sincerely in both of them, and he changed directions at the last minute. In that process, no other worldlines were influenced. Yeon-woo had become more familiar with the Black King\u2019s abilities now.\u2018He\u2019s definitely fast. If I think of how long it took me to perfectly learn how to use the Heavenly Demon\u2019s power\u2026\u2019The Heavenly Demon could only say with confidence that he understood his full powers after the wheel was spun about four or five times. He was quite annoyed at the endless battle with the Black King, and he\u2019d been contemplating how he could put him to sleep forever. In the process, after much training, he was finally able to reach his full potential.Of course, the Black King was motivated to wake up faster because the Heavenly Demon became stronger, so it was pretty futile.Anyhow, Yeon-woo was rapidly learning his powers compared to the centuries the Heavenly Demon had required.\u2018That means he\u2019s almost finished with transcending too, I suppose?\u2019 The Heavenly Demon stroked his chin and searched up the rate of progress Yeon-woo had achieved in the book they just read.[Rate of Change: 61%]\u2018As expected. He\u2019s picked up the pace.\u2019The rate of change that was only fast in the beginning and began to slow down had sped up again. This wasn\u2019t an event that should be glossed over.\u2018If the Black King\u2019s transcendence is complete\u2026 What\u2019ll happen then?\u2019The Heavenly Demon and Black King\u2019s longtime battle was finished, and a new era had opened. Now, the Black King was preparing his new comeback. No one, not even the Heavenly Demon, who transcended all eras, knew what it would result in.\u2018Well, it\u2019s obvious those stars over there will be used as sacrifices.\u2019However, there were still questions left unanswered.\u201cHow many pages are left?\u201d\u201cThis is the last page.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon nodded at Jeong-woo to quickly open it. Jeong-woo swallowed the flipped the last page.* * *Yeon-woo waved his hand in the air as he looked at Leo, who was glowering at him.\u00a0Clatter.\u00a0The chains that bound Leo became tighter.\u201cBlack\u2026King\u2026!\u201dChwak!\u201cI will\u2026repay this humiliation\u2026 No matter what\u2026!\u201dYeon-woo ignored Leo\u2019s bullshit and proceeded to tear his spiritual body apart. There were no screams. It was a futile end for the lion constellation who was called the leader of the stars.\u00a0Fwoosh\u2026[Leo has died!][You have obtained a star fragment.]A shining object floated above where Leo was torn apart. It was the star fragment, similar to what Yeon-woo had given to the Martial King before. When Yeon-woo extended his hand for it, it came whirling inside his palm.[The dream world is fading!]Krrrr\u2026.!\u00a0The world surrounding Yeon-woo began to collapse. Since it had served its purpose, he stopped dreaming. What appeared instead of the destroyed world was a world where all time was paused, the original worldline. It was paused exactly at the highlight of the wedding, the bowing of the groom and bride. The world was separated exactly from when Leo stood up to where he was.Yeon-woo looked fondly at Edora, who was bowing with traditional rouge applied on her cheeks, and he sighed, then turned in the opposite direction. But just then\u2026\u201cWhy are you sighing on a good day like this? You\u2019re still mad?\u201d Yeon-woo jumped in surprise. The Martial King was clicking his tongue at him as he picked his ear with his pinkie. The Martial King added, \u201cWhy are you so surprised? What? Are you shocked that your great teacher is moving?\u201dYeon-woo found himself nodding before he knew it. He hadn\u2019t artificially paused the world, and even the expansion of the world had stopped. No matter how incredible you were, unless you were an emperor, it was impossible for you to move independently. However, the Martial King didn\u2019t look like he was experiencing any discomfort at all.\u2018The level of his soul still isn\u2019t complete\u2026!\u2019Considering that the Martial King was currently a vestige body without a soul, he truly had an incredible determination. He must\u2019ve felt Yeon-woo\u2019s surprise because he smirked and shrugged his shoulders. \u201cWhat are you so surprised about? It\u2019s like not doing amazing things is a rare occurrence for me. Hahaha!\u201dThe Martial King burst out laughing for a while, but then he suddenly stopped and looked at Yeon-woo. His silent gaze created a sad and bitter atmosphere. \u201cThe thing in your hand. You were going to give it to me and leave right away, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re like a ghost, knowing everything.\u201d Yeon-woo smiled wryly.\u201cI am a ghost though, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m leaving so you don\u2019t have to stay like that forever.\u201dYeon-woo had already read all the thoughts in Leo\u2019s mind while obtaining his star fragment. As a result, he was able to learn how to enter the Unreal World, the world where the stars resided. He could open the door.However, this required a substantial amount of preparation. The Unreal World was a completely different world where the laws of the Heavenly Demon and Black King didn\u2019t work. To enter it, he had no choice but to seal most of his power as the Black King. He would only enter with his consciousness as Cha Yeon-woo.Yeon-woo might have to start from scratch in that world. And if he died? His body as the Black King would remain, but his ego as Cha Yeon-woo would be deleted. Then, everything would return to the old days of reincarnation, when the wheel was spun endlessly.And since he was trying to fight a war against the stars, who most definitely had it out for him\u2026 It was practically a suicide mission. Still, Yeon-woo was going to enter the Unreal World. Like he\u2019d told the Martial King, he needed to collect all the star fragments for the Martial King\u2019s resurrection to be complete. However, he\u2019d been planning on hiding how dangerous it was as much as possible and returning before the Martial King and Edora caught on.If Yeon-woo left with the time of this world forced frozen and went to the Unreal World, it would only be a short blip for them. They wouldn\u2019t have to worry about him. But his plan to return as quietly as possible was ruined from the start. It was very much like his teacher to do so. Logic didn\u2019t apply to the Martial King.\u201cSince you say you\u2019re going, I won\u2019t stop you. I\u2019m sure you have your plans too.\u201d The Martial King didn\u2019t try to stop Yeon-woo from leaving. No, in the first place, he never intended to. It wasn\u2019t because of his personal greed to be resurrected, but because he trusted his disciple. He had absolute faith that Yeon-woo would return without getting hurt.Yeon-woo could feel the trust in him and nodded solemnly. He gave the star fragment in his hand to the Martial King. From Leo to the subordinates he\u2019d brought along, Denebola and Algieba, the total of three fragments transformed into rays of light and were absorbed by the Martial King.Chht!\u00a0While the Martial King closed his eyes to absorb all the energy, Yeon-woo bowed at Kronos, who had silently been watching them from some point. Although later than the Martial King, his father had also woken up from the restriction of time.\u201cI\u2019ll return, Father.\u201d\u201c\u2026You don\u2019t need me to come with you?\u201d\u201cI can do it perfectly fine on my own.\u201d\u201cAll right. I understand. Take care. I\u2019ll watch over my daughter-in-law too.\u201d Kronos turned to the side and wiped his eyes that were slowly turning red. He was trying to act as dignified as possible, but it wasn\u2019t easy for him to reign in the emotions.And like that, Yeon-woo closed his eyes after finishing his goodbyes to his teacher and father. After entering the Unreal World, the restrictions of time set on Metatron and Baal would also be released. The two would return to the Tower with the Eight Gods of Disorder as they\u2019d promised.Yeon-woo would provide a trap there and capture all the stars who came after R'lyeh. Even without it, though, he wasn\u2019t too worried about this world. His other self, the same blood and flesh as him, would be here.\u201cJeong-woo, you\u2019re watching this, right?\u201d Yeon-woo thought of the face of his brother, who would be or was watching this from the Changgong Library.\u201cKeep this place safe until I come back. And make sure no one hits on your sister-in-law.\u201d With a mischievous last smile, Yeon-woo\u2019s body disappeared in light, as if he had never existed in this world.* * *\u201c\u2026He does everything his way, always. Geez.\u201dTak!\u00a0Jeong-woo snapped shut the cover of the book and sighed. From the moment he couldn\u2019t find Yeon-woo and Yeon-woo started his wedding without him, he\u2019d had his doubts\u2026but it seemed like his doubts were becoming true.Yeon-woo was essentially telling Jeong-woo to clean up after his mess. The reason why he hadn\u2019t invited him to the wedding was because he knew Jeong-woo would try to stop him if he said he was entering the Unreal World.How was someone so unchanging? Jeong-woo pressed his throbbing temples and organized his thoughts.\u2018The water\u2019s already spilled\u2026 It\u2019s not like I can force him out either, so I should do what I can for now.\u2019 Jeong-woo\u2019s eyes turned contemplative. \u2018There\u2019s two things Hyung\u2019s aiming for with this.\u2019Jeong-woo\u2019s mind spun quickly. \u2018First is to collect all the star fragments, and second\u2026\u2019 His eyes flashed coldly. \u2018To complete transcending.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let\u2019s resume after editing this part out.\u201dOn Producer Kim\u2019s orders, the cameramen and staff moved busily. Shin Sung-chan scratched the back of his head and sidled next to Producer Kim, asking, \u201cIt\u2019s not going well, is it?\u201d\u201cWell, we can cut out the odd bits, and the episode doesn\u2019t need to be too long, so we\u2019ll get a good chunk. Since it\u2019s for Youtube, it can be more raw, but\u2026you seem pretty nervous today.\u201d\u201cReally? Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve come to school.\u201dAs Producer Kim said, idol variety shows these days were about ten to fifteen minutes per episode, and no more than thirty. It wasn\u2019t that difficult to film a full-length episode. Also, it wasn\u2019t that worrisome that the filming wasn\u2019t going smoothly because fans actually liked it when their celebrities seemed nervous. It was the type of raw emotion that wasn\u2019t shown on public TV channels.However, neither Shin Sung-chan nor Producer Kim looked satisfied. Shin Sung-chan had two years of idol experience under his belt, so he knew that there wasn\u2019t much that could really be salvaged from today. Producer Kim had gone freelance after quitting a pretty well-known TV station, so he was anxious not to fail.Shin Sung-chan and Producer Kim racked their brains to think of a solution. They looked through the script and contemplated whether they should prepare another corner or not. But there wasn\u2019t anything interesting in particular that could be filmed with the school or the store as the background\u2026 Or they could ask for permission from the school and film him hanging out with his friends. That might be better. There were many fans who wanted to know about Shin Sung-chan\u2019s school life too.Just as Producer Kim was wondering what direction they needed to take this in, one scriptwriter came up to him and said something.\u201cWhat? Really?\u201dThe scriptwriter nodded, saying it had been confirmed just moments ago, and Producer Kim brightened. Then, he looked toward Shin Sung-chan mischievously, as if asking why he had kept such an item hidden.Shin Sung-chan got an ominous feeling. All of their group members had suffered whenever Producer Kim made that smile.\u201cI just heard the \u2018Idol\u2019 attends your school? And she\u2019s in the same class as you. Why did you hide something so interesting?\u201d\u2018N-No!\u2019 Shin Sung-chan barely stopped himself from shouting. He was an idol too, but he knew too well who the \u201cIdol\u201d Producer Kim was speaking about was: Cha So-yeong. The girl was famous for being the youngest S-class player when there were dungeons and gates. She was well-known internationally, and she had many fans due to her cold and arrogant expression despite her age.However, after all the dungeons and gates were closed, Cha So-yeong retired and didn\u2019t make any public appearances. The mystery of it all made people curious about how Cha so-yeong was doing these days.Cha So-yeong recently garnered attention after articles about her entering high school made waves, but to think that it was the school that Shin Sung-chan attended! On top of that, she was his classmate. Producer Kim\u2019s eyes blazed.On the other hand, Shin Sung-chan had difficulty controlling his expression as the name he wanted to avoid came up. It wasn\u2019t like he could say it was awkward to see her because she rejected him either. He could trust Producer Kim, but if the other staff got wind of this\u2026 his face might be on the front page of tomorrow\u2019s newspaper.<Sung-chan of \u2018Bad Boys\u2019 rejected by \u2018Idol\u2019?><How Sung-chan of \u2018Bad Boys\u2019 became a sad boy>These would probably be the main headlines, and as a seventeen year old, Shin Sung-chan didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed on a national level when he had just become an adolescent. \u2018I have to stop him!\u2019 Shin Sung-chan was about to say anything but Cha So-yeong, when\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re close, right?\u201d Producer Kim grinned and spoke first.\u201cThe thing is\u2026\u201d\u201cGoodness, Producer Kim. That\u2019s such an obvious question.\u201dShin Sung-chan was about to hint why he couldn\u2019t do it when the scriptwriter jumped into their conversation.\u201cRight?\u201d\u201cOf course. They call her an Idol and all that, but our Sung-chan is famous too. Famous people have that connection with each other, don\u2019t they, Sung-chan?\u201d\u201cU-Uh\u2026\u201d\u201cOoh. That\u2019s nice. So how\u2019s the Idol\u2019s personality? Is she really as arrogant as they say? I also heard she\u2019s quite mature for her age.\u201d\u201cOh my. Then she must be close to Sung-chan. Sung-chan\u2019s also like that. It must be because they\u2019ve been in society from a young age.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSo? You\u2019re close, right?\u201dIt was hard to say no since they said that. Shin Sung-chan couldn\u2019t refuse the producer and scriptwriter\u2019s expectant faces. On top of that, the other staff were murmuring excitedly about seeing the Idol, so he couldn\u2019t decline them and say he wasn\u2019t close\u2026 He was a people pleaser, and his pride as a young boy didn\u2019t allow him to say he didn\u2019t know the girl.Shin Sung-chan swallowed and nodded. \u201cO-Of course\u2026!\u201d Shin Sung-chan felt like he was digging his own grave.* * *Usually, Sung-chan was right when he received an ominous feeling, and this very moment was no exception. He greeted Sesha when she was pushed to the store by the crowd, but her face looked as if she was asking him what he was doing. It was the expression she made when her classmates or seniors who weren\u2019t close to her spoke to her. Many male students had fallen for that icy gaze.\u2018Well, I was among them too.\u2019Cha So-yeong was very pretty. She was as pretty or even prettier than the female celebrities Sung-chan has met during his career.\u2018But what should I do now\u2026?\u2019 Sung-chan\u2019s heart raced when she didn\u2019t answer him.\u00a0Thump, thump, thump.\u00a0He got chills running down his back, because he thought that the lie he told would be revealed. Producer Kim and the scriptwriter seemed to notice something was off too. His heart pumped faster as if he ran straight for two hundred meters.\u201cYeah. Hi.\u201d Sesha waved and walked back up the stairs. Her best friend Park Yoo-min smiled awkwardly and followed her.\u201cWow\u2026 I heard even adults have a hard time speaking to her, so it was true! Yoon-hu, did you get that just now?\u201d\u201cYes, I got it clear and well. She really is different.\u201dFortunately, Producer Kim didn\u2019t think it was strange. He was more interested in how much of Sesha was recorded.Haaa!\u00a0Shin Sung-chan breathed out in relief.\u00a0Thump, thump, thump.\u00a0His heart slowed down, but it was still beating fast. However, the reason for this thumping was different from before.\u201c\u2026\u201d Shin Sung-chan stared at the stairs where Sesha had just been.* * *\u201cYou know that?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThey say you\u2019re indifferent, but I think you\u2019re just super cynical.\u201d\u201cNonsense.\u201dSesha chatted with Park Yoo-min as she walked back to class.\u201cI\u2019m right. Only you could treat Sung-chan so coldly.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d\u201cSee? But you\u2019re really not interested in boys?\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201d\u201cStrange.\u201dDidn\u2019t girls usually dream of having boyfriends at this age? At this age, girls had lots of dreams and things they liked. They would gossip with their friends about who was good-looking, who was cute, and who was their ideal type.The same went for Park Yoo-min. She was determined to get a boyfriend this spring and go to the cherry flower festival with him. If that didn\u2019t happen, she would get a boyfriend before June and go to the Yeouido Festival then. If she couldn\u2019t do either before she graduated high school, her high school life would be too sad.But thinking about it, Park Yoo-min didn\u2019t remember Sesha ever talking about boys. When they were talking about it with their friend group on the way home, she was just listening. She only spoke up to give advice.That was why Yoo-min was curious as to whether or not Sesha was interested in boys or not. She never looked at the boys who were always chasing her around. It couldn\u2019t hurt to take a slight peek, could it?And the Bad Boys were one of the top three boy bands these days, with Shin Sung-chan being the most popular and youngest. He probably had many individual fans. And the way he looked at Sesha\u2026 From a third-party\u2019s point of view, he looked like he still cared very much.\u201cSure, very strange.\u201d Sesha just responded with an uncaring face. To be honest, she wanted to say \u201cif you went through those things in the Tower, you wouldn\u2019t be interested in boys either.\u201d She spent a childhood most people couldn\u2019t even imagine, and she had matured psychologically unwittingly. Of course the boys her age wouldn\u2019t meet her standards. They just seemed like immature little children to her.Sesha\u2019s surroundings didn\u2019t do any good for her either. Kronos, Cha Jeong-woo, and Yeon-woo\u2026 All of them were men who were at the top of what they did. Moreover, they were lookers too.\u201cStill, our So-yeong\u2019s grown up, huh? You responded to him since there was a camera rolling?\u201d\u201cStop hugging me. It\u2019s hot.\u201d\u201cThat only makes me wanna do it more!\u201d\u201cHey!\u201d* * *Class began, and they were on their second break period.Growl.\u00a0Sesha hugged her starved stomach. \u2018So hungry\u2026\u2019 She should\u2019ve eaten the breakfast her mom prepared for her. Strangely, she was feeling even hungrier today. She rested her head on her desk, not wanting to do anything in particular.Plop!\u00a0Suddenly, something fell next to her. Sesha opened her eyes and saw a plastic bag filled with bread sitting on her desk.Park Yoo-min looked at Sesha like she was pathetic. \u201cYou should go to the store if you\u2019re hungry. What are you doing lying over your desk like that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m too lazy.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re not too lazy to breathe too?\u201d\u201cI am. But not anymore!\u201d Sesha jumped up and dug through the bag. Yoo-min had brought many kinds of bread, even the bean jam buns Sesha enjoyed.\u201cSheesh. And they call you Idol.\u201d Park Yoo-min shook her head from side to side. Starving out of laziness? Yoo-min detested being hungry more than anything, so she didn\u2019t understand. But Sesha still enjoyed eating what Yoo-min brought her. She looked like a squirrel eating an acorn as she carefully tore open the cover and chewed the bun.\u201cBe neater when you eat, geez.\u201d Park Yoo-min pulled out a wet tissue and wiped the jam and sugar that was on Sesha\u2019s face. Sesha squeezed her eyes together and began to eat her bread again when Yoo-min removed the tissue. Yoo-min muttered, \u201cHow did you become the Idol when you require so much care?\u201d\u201cHumph. I can take care of myself.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Sure.\u201d Park Yoo-min shook her head and spoke as she pulled a bun out of the bag for herself. \u201cOh right. You know the filming from this morning.\u201d\u201cChan-sung? That thing he was filming?\u201d\u201c\u2026it\u2019s Sung-chan.\u201d\u201cSame thing.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t ever say that in front of his fans. They\u2019re gonna crush your head in.\u201d\u201cSheesh. Anyway, what about it? They\u2019re still filming it?\u201d\u201cYeah. They\u2019re probably filming until the after-school study session is done.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to film?\u201d\u201cThey said they\u2019re going to film our school\u2019s mystery.\u201dHearing about the school\u2019s mystery, Sesha had an odd feeling and tilted her head inquiringly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(2)Collecting the star fragments was to complete the existence of the unstable Martial King as well as prevent the stars from wreaking havoc on multiple worldlines. From Jeong-woo\u2019s perspective, stars were nothing more than pests. However, due to their traits, it was difficult to eradicate them, and there were many things he had to be worried about.So Jeong-woo understood why Yeon-woo jumped directly into the source of it all. However, Jeong-woo thought that Yeon-woo\u2019s biggest objective was the second reason, which was complete transcendence.Technically, Yeon-woo was currently in a cocoon-like state. He was a caterpillar growing inside its hard cocoon, desperately wishing to wake up someday. And when he managed to pierce through his shell, even Jeong-woo couldn\u2019t imagine what Yeon-woo would look like.Yeon-woo probably didn\u2019t know either. No one in this world had ever stepped foot inside the territory that was beyond emperor. The result could be good, or it could be bad. It was a case of Schr\u00f6dinger's cat. No one knew what the condition of the cat trapped inside the box would be before the lid was opened.\u2018So he probably wants to increase the chances of things turning out the way he wants them to.\u2019No one knew what Yeon-woo would be like after he broke out of the shell. However, it was definitely predictable that his existence would surpass the current universe\u2019s system. And his consciousness could probably reach the Unreal World too.\u2018He wants to experience the Unreal World before his transcendence is complete and become familiar with his transcendence through it. If he has the experience, he\u2019ll be able to control whatever shape the transcendence takes after.\u2019There was also the benefit that Yeon-woo could dramatically speed up the rate of progress through the new stimulation.\u2018Or he could slowly stain the Unreal World with the color of the Black King.\u2019Of course, it was that much riskier as well. Until he could stain the Unreal World with darkness and somewhat be able to pull from that power, Yeon-woo\u2019s actions would be limited.\u2018In the end, the Unreal World is the territory of the stars.\u2019Tossing aside the omniscience and omnipotence Yeon-woo\u2019d obtained so far and starting from scratch in the Unreal World again? It was nonsense. But Yeon-woo was truly attempting to do it.\u201cDo whatever you want, sheesh.\u201d Cha Jeong-woo let out a deep sigh. Yeon-woo left without a word to him, so he couldn\u2019t do much right now. All he could do from here was pray desperately for Yeon-woo to return safely. Now, he could start searching if there was any other way he could help.\u201cMr. Heavenly Demon.\u201d Jeong-woo turned to look at the Heavenly Demon.The Heavenly Demon made a mysterious smile as if he already knew what Jeong-woo was thinking. \u201cYou want to ask me if there\u2019s a way to confirm the events going on in the Unreal World, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, sir.\u201d Jeong-woo nodded gravely. \u201cDarkness will increasingly stain the world the more my brother causes trouble over there. Then that must mean that the chances of being able to see him will be higher\u2026!\u201d\u201cAnd then the events will be automatically recorded in the Changgong Library, is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d\u201cIs that possible?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon nodded. Cha Jeong-woo sighed in disappointment.\u300eExcuse me, Mr. Heavenly Demon! Why are you saying we can\u2019t?! I may not have completely understood before because I\u2019m dumb, but wouldn\u2019t the dream naturally be incorporated over there if our Emperor Temper starts making tides?\u300f\u201cThat\u2019s true. However, the Changgong Library only records events from within boundaries that \u201cI\u201d know. I\u2019m saying\u00a0I\u2019m\u00a0the principal agent.\u201d\u300e\u2026Then that means it\u2019s impossible to find out anything about the Unreal World unless you enter it yourself?\u300f\u201cYes.\u201d\u300eThen if you could help master from there\u2026!\u300fShanon pressed his lips together when he saw the Heavenly Demon\u2019s steady gaze on him. The Heavenly Demon\u2019s Fiery Golden Eyes contained no emotion. It was as if the light banter they\u2019d been exchanging only moments ago was all a lie. Shanon belatedly realized his mistake.I apologize. That was rude of me. I was hasty and\u2026\u201cLet\u2019s not cross the line.\u201d\u201cI apologize if you were offended. I will apologize in his stead.\u201dOnly after Jeong-woo stepped in did the Heavenly Demon relax his Fiery Golden Eyes. He scratched the back of his head, muttering, \u201cI know how both of you feel, but who will manage this place if I leave too? I\u2019m already overburdened as it is.\u201dIt was true the Heavenly Demo was assisting them greatly, and that he was treating them with goodwill. However, the Black King and the Heavenly Demon were like two sides of a coin that could never coexist. They had fought for eons, spinning the wheel endlessly, until just recently.But to ask the Heavenly Demon for help in saving the Black King? They would be putting the Heavenly Demon in the same danger. If something were to go wrong with the both of them, the creation of the universe would be finished.From then, the stars would start to roam wild without having to worry about anyone stopping them. It would be the beginning of true hell. That was why the Heavenly Demon denied Shanon\u2019s suggestion.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Just then, the Heavenly Demon smiled roguishly. \u201cI suppose it would be weird to sit still and do nothing, huh?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u300e\u2026?\u300fJeong-woo and Shanon turned to the Heavenly Demon simultaneously, and the Heavenly Demon waved his hand in the air.\u00a0Whoosh!\u00a0System messages popped up consecutively in the air.[The Changgong Library\u2019s control system commences operation with the authority of the special administrator!][The Changgong Library\u2019s jurisdiction is expanded.][Expanded territory: Unreal World.][The territory is a new domain that hasn\u2019t been reached by light. More data is required for an update.][New search modules are designed for a smoother search.][A new algorithm is adopted.]\u2026[Warning! This is an attempt that is beyond the authority of the special administrator! A forced request may cause a bad influence on your domain. Would you still like to proceed?][You have chosen to proceed.][The operation is resumed.]\u2026Looking at the onslaught of new messages, Jeong-woo and Shanon realized the Heavenly Demon was taking a risk to help them. They didn\u2019t know how dangerous the attempt was, but based on the contents of the messages, it definitely wasn\u2019t something simple. Still, they didn\u2019t try to stop him. That would\u2019ve been an act of disgracing him.[Efficient modules cannot be designed. More data is necessary.][The search range is minimized.][An observer is designated to collect the data.]\u2026Jeong-woo stretched his hand out in the air as he saw the messages. Light shone as a new book appeared. It was an empty book, but that wouldn\u2019t be the case a few moments later. Events centered around Yeon-woo would soon be written in this book.Jeong-woo\u2019s divine name was Deus Ex Machina. He was the god of mechanics to mechanically record and interpret all information. In this field, he was better than the Heavenly Demon. At this moment, Jeong-woo\u2019s full attention and consciousness was focused on the book. A short while later\u2026!\u00a0Fwoosh!The characters \u201cCha Yeon-woo\u201d were written on the cover of the book. Not Black King, but Cha Yeon-woo. It meant a module based on the information Yeon-woo collected in the Unreal World was completed.The Heavenly Demon had the control system of the Changgong Library focused on Yeon-woo, and Jeong-woo was in charge of recording the collected information.\u00a0Flutter!\u00a0The book opened and the pages flipped over as words were written on the white paper.This place\u2026Like an essay or a diary, Yeon-woo\u2019s thoughts were starting to be recorded. It felt strange for Jeong-woo, as he had once left a diary behind for Yeon-woo, but their places were switched now.Is a lot different than what I thought.That was the very first sentence of Yeon-woo\u2019s diary.* * *The modern universe was created when a very small light suddenly exploded in a world filled only with darkness. The rapidly expanded universe resulted in both matter and antimatter. Most of the antimatter was transformed into matter and used for the expansion of the universe, but what wasn\u2019t used simply bounced somewhere out of the universe.The antimatter and other waste that wasn\u2019t used in the creation of the universe combined together to create a new world: the Unreal World. And since it was a world created by the scattered pieces of the egg Pangu broke out of, Yeon-woo thought it was only a \u201cworld\u201d in name. It couldn\u2019t be a proper world.\u2018But I was wrong.\u2019 Yeon-woo laughed in disbelief as he looked over the information from Leo. \u2018This place has its own laws of nature as well.\u2019 In fact, this world was operating pretty similarly to the real world Yeon-woo had been in. \u2018It\u2019s like it was copied from the real world\u2026 Like a reflection in the mirror.\u2019Mirrors reflected the world. The contents inside a mirror were exactly the same as what it was reflecting. However, it was only a reflection, and it could never be the real thing. That was what the Unreal World was like. It was reflecting the wheel spun by cogs, the Black King and the Heavenly Demon.And that was what the stars wanted. Creation was the ultimate purpose they wished to achieve. They had created the Unreal World in this manner so they could practice. \u2018They also want to destroy the wheel completely and keep their world as the real one.\u2019 There was nothing that great about the cogs of the wheel or creation, but it seemed these stars wanted to reach it.Yeon-woo scoffed, but he also thought it was for the better. \u2018I\u2019ll retrieve all the fragments here and complete my transcendence.\u2019 He specified his purpose and searched for a way to manifest himself first. \u2018I have to hide my existence here for now, so I should use a body that\u2019s already active\u2026\u2019If it was someone already living in the Unreal World, there was no way the stars would know even if Yeon-woo projected his identity on the being. In other words, he needed to find a vessel to possess\u2026 He couldn\u2019t steal the body of someone who was perfectly alive and well, so it needed to be someone who was on the verge of death or had recently died. The being also needed to be strong to hold Yeon-woo\u2019s identity.\u2018If the being\u2019s synchronization rate with the Black King is naturally high, there won\u2019t be any issues when I summon my powers from my true body.\u2019 Yeon-woo wondered if there would be a vessel that could satisfy all these particular conditions, but it was a body he needed to use for a while with all his powers sealed, so he needed to choose well.Whoosh.\u00a0After closely examining every crevice of the world, Yeon-woo was finally able to find a soul that resonated well with darkness. Of course, that didn\u2019t mean he could just possess the body. Just when he was about to confirm the condition of the vessel\u2026[Someone has sensed your consciousness!]\u2018Already?\u2019 Yeon-woo jolted at the warning message. He did expect one of the stars would discover his invading consciousness, but he didn\u2019t know it would be this quick. Had they already learned of Leo\u2019s disappearance? Or did they coincidentally happen to find him? Yeon-woo didn\u2019t know what the reason was, but he was certain of one thing. If he was caught, things would be\u00a0really\u00a0bad.\u2018I have no choice.\u2019 Yeon-woo decided to risk it and moved toward the being he found moments earlier.[Your consciousness invades the being. You are attempting to possess this human!][Checking the conditions of the being\u2026]\u2026[The one who has discovered you is approaching your vicinity.]Yeon-woo started to become anxious.[They are closing in!][Warning! They are becoming closer!]\u2026Just before the star\u2019s gaze reached Yeon-woo\u2019s consciousness, Yeon-woo felt his consciousness swept elsewhere.[You have successfully possessed the being!]The first thing that came to mind was how uncomfortable it was. It was like a prison that was too small to even stand.[The particular someone did not find you!][The star scratches their head in confusion and leaves the territory.]It didn\u2019t feel all too good to return to living as a normal human when Yeon-woo\u2019d been the omniscient Black King.

Hurry up and move along!\u201dIt was a whip with sharp thorns embedded into it.Side Story Part 1 Complete-------------------------------------------Author\u2019s AfterwordThe side stories started in January have already come to an end. There are many sections I regret not delivering properly, but I will make sure to continue telling the story in season two.Since the brainstorming process, I have already decided to split the side stories into two seasons. The first season would contain more of the epilogue of the main story, and the second season was to show the various facets of the worldline.However, I was having difficulties managing my work schedule between both my new novel <\ubd80\uc11c\uc9c4 \uc131\uc88c\uc758 \ud68c\uadc0(official title: The Divine Twilight's Return)> and this epilogue. I took over one month to catch up, and I was frequently on hiatus.It was all due to how inexperienced I was and my lack of sufficient preparations, and I want to take this opportunity to apologize to my readers once more.That is why the season two of the epilogue, in which a new story will begin, will begin after much more preparation. I cannot guarantee any dates, but I\u2019ll carefully estimate it to be maybe around the time when I\u2019ve finished <The Divine Twilight's Return> and the universe (worldline) I am writing is somewhat better developed (of course, I don\u2019t plan on being irresponsible and taking more than a year).The works that are a part of the <Second Life Ranker> universe are as follows:<\uc2e0\uc138\uae30\uc804> (unofficial title: Tales From a New Age)<Second Life Ranker><\uac80\uc2e0\uad11\ub8e1> (unofficial title: Sword God, Light Dragon)<\uc7ac\ub2a5 \uc0bc\ud0a8 \ub9c8\ubc95\uc0ac> (unofficial title: Talent-Swallowing Magician)In the case of <Talent-Swallowing Magician>, it is a work I directed (I didn\u2019t write it personally!), and its mobile game and webtoon are planned for launch in the latter half of this year.Aside from that, I am planning various works with a few brilliant writers who will make this universe shine.The Sadoyeon Universe (this is a temporary name. I haven't chosen a specific name yet^^) won\u2019t be restricted to webnovels, but it will be shown through several forms of media, so please look forward to it (on a side note, the universe will be prepared in a way that makes it approachable without having to read any of the other mentioned works. But of course, you\u2019ll be able to find fun Easter Eggs if you\u2019ve read the other works)I will return with more fun side stories! The hot summer has gone by, and autumn is now coming. I hope you all take care not to become sick while the seasons change.Thank you,\u65af\u9053\u2027\u7de3 (Sadoyeon)inyourgalaxy's ThoughtsThe author\u2019s afterword was published in August of 2021, so there have been a few updates since then.The webtoon and game for Talent-Swallowing Magician have already been launched. The game is only available in Korea as of now.<The Divine Twilight's Return> webtoon will be officially launched soon on Tapas.<The Divine Twilight's Return> novel will be officially translated soon on Wuxiaworld.It's been quite the journey coming with all of you up to this point, Thank you all so much, and an especially big thanks to Plumpcat, my co-translator. See you all soon when part two of the side stories is released, and until next time!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They themselves could not recall when they started calling each other by these names. They called themselves with these names ever since they realized that they were different from others. Like the star lights that filled the evening sky, they said that they also shined brightly. Moreover, they were such shining existences.***The Southern Arrow was one such star. He was originally a chieftain who ruled over a primitive tribe. He lived in a jungle where the trees were so dense that it was hard to tell what was ahead, and every step one took, one would only see muddy swampland. From an early age, he boasted unparalleled strength, agility, and a physical build with innate muscles that were incomparable to others. Because of this, all those he faced as enemies were steeped in fear and trembled when they confronted him.In battle, he would suddenly disappear. He would torment enemies by shooting out poisoned stingers between large boulders, whipping with vines from the tops of trees, and setting traps on the ground, where an enemy would fall and be pierced by spears.For this reason, everyone was reluctant to confront the tribe whose chieftain was known as the southern arrow. No, it was more correct to say that there was no confrontation at all. His enemies knew that once they collided, only death would welcome them.\u201cThe southern arrow is always followed, like a person\u2019s shadow, by the god of death.\u201d\u00a0It was not unreasonable that such rumors circulated. The jungle\u2019s various tribes, who feared spirits and gods, were naturally fearful of such an existence, and within a few years, the hundreds of jungle tribes were soon united into one under the Southern Arrow.Once united, an empire was born. The empire terrorized the civilized people living in the southern regions for decades. Southern Arrow\u2019s vigorous conquest did not stop there. As if conquest was his fate, the Southern Arrow constantly sent out his tribesmen to the outside to expand his empire\u2019s territory. They moved out of the jungle, into the grasslands, into the deserts, and even into the glacial territories. They consolidated the area where the so-called non-civilized people lived and crossed the \u2018barrier\u2019 that had previously restricted them.Countless civilizations collapsed. Many kings\u2019 heads were snagged, palaces burnt, and screams and groans echoed throughout the plundered capitals. Many tried to block the Southern Arrow, but no one was able to stop him. Then, he took over the last capital of the last remaining empire.In the end, Southern Arrow sat down on the throne, which was made from the corpses of the previous emperor and imperial family who claimed that they were descendants of heaven and who had looked down on everything in the whole world.Then, the Southern Arrow had stumbled upon a treasure that the previous emperor cherished. It was an imperial jade seal. The jade seal was as white as snow, sparkled like gold, and contained a blood-like red hue. It was a royal seal that contained all the attributes of omen, ecstasy, and sacredness. The previous emperor had said that it was an ornament that symbolized the imperial family from generation to generation.The story was that one day, the founder of the empire had a dream, and a mysterious old man appeared and disappeared, leaving behind only the words, \u2018Your hand will restore the light of the world.\u2019The founder, who woke up from the strange dream, felt that something was off, so he went outside and saw a meteor fall from the night sky. He decided that he had received a heavenly command, so he made a seal from the piece of fallen meteor and began to gather soldiers as a gift for the sacred object. This was the creation legend of how the empire originated. Moreover, the jade seal possessed indescribable qualities and accomplished various miracles, such as healing the wounded, allowing the lame to walk, and opening the eyes of the blind.However, the Southern Arrow realized something as soon as he saw the jade seal.\u00a0\u201cStupid people. This jade seal was like pearls on a swine in their hands. How could they not know what treasure they possessed?\u201dThe jade seal was being misused. It had to be used for something bigger, a larger purpose, not as a charm to heal people and keep the royal family healthy. It had to be used for something greater. It was a treasure that must be used to reach heights that seemed impossible for humans and their limitations.Thus, Southern Arrow killed all the members of the royal family who shouted for the imperial jade seal to be returned and took over the royal throne within a day. Rather than simply carrying the jade seal around, and in order to fully digest the power contained within the jade seal, Southern Arrow put the jade seal in the safest place he knew, his own stomach.The Southern Arrow\u2019s judgment proved to be accurate. His eyes opened. He was able to see not only the great empire he had built, but also the realms beyond his territories. There were all kinds of rare things in the world. He learned about the existence of a huge salt lake and the existence of other continents that were as big as the continent he ruled over. It was only then that Southern Arrow realized, for the first time, that if he went to the endless north, a night as white as broad daylight would appear.Southern Arrow also realized that he was on a planet called \u2018Kwan\u2019, a speck of dust in a seemingly endless expanse of darkness. The sensation that came after realizing all this was\u2026pure bliss. It was only then that he realized how narrow he had viewed the world. His vision and his thoughts had been limited. Ordinary people would feel frustrated or helpless at the fact that they were insignificant in such a situation.However, the Southern Arrow had smacked his lips and thought,\u00a0\u201cI want all of it. Like the stars that shine brightly in the sky, I want to shine. No matter where anyone is, I want them to look up and see my majesty.\u201dWhat Southern Arrow wanted was not a hopeless dream. If he were able to fully consume the jade seal, the realization of his dream seemed to be a real possibility. Though he had only swallowed the jade-seal, his vision and senses had expanded to this extent. So, from then on, Southern Arrow conquered the planet Kwan, and referred to himself as the incarnation of a god.Southern Arrow instructed all the people to call him by that title. The people, servants, and the various monarchs all knelt and bowed their heads to him. And they prayed. In their eyes, Southern Arrow was like the second coming of god, who had descended upon their planet. If the great man who accomplished such great achievements, which had never before been seen, was not a god, then who or what could be called a god?Southern Arrow became a being with a divine legend. None of the other legends on planet Kwan stacked up to Southern Arrow\u2019s. He was already the only god who ruled over civilization and planets.With such a legend, Southern Arrow closed his eyes at the age of sixty-five. He was respected, awed, and feared. And, as he continued to gain faith\u2026***When Southern Arrow opened his eyes again, he knew he was no longer human. The body was but a prison and shackle that limited one\u2019s soul. Having shaken it off, he was now truly free. He shone brilliantly. He became a constellation that filled the night sky. The people who mourned or rejoiced over his death named the new constellation of stars \u2018Sagitta\u2019.\u201cI have become a star.\u201d\u00a0Southern Arrow knew that he had become a divine being. Just before closing his eyes, he digested the last part of the jade seal and became the jade seal itself.The jade seal was originally a meteorite, or a shooting star. It could also be seen as the corpse of a star. Southern Arrow succeeded in absorbing and inheriting this corpse, resulting in a resurrection. His soul merged with the meteorite to evolve into a new being, and now, he could emit light like a star!So, Southern Arrow referred to himself as a \u2018star\u2019. Most of the beings who were called gods, demons, dragons, and giants were born with those titles and powers. They lucked into a good ancestry and birth. Only a few had gained those titles or powers by proving their worth.Of course, there were also those who accumulated achievements and legends and achieved exuviation and transcendence. However, Southern Arrow felt that he was different from these beings. No matter how hard they tried to fly or run, in the end, they could not escape the category of lower gods of a heavenly society, and it was virtually impossible for them to become stronger. On the other hand, how about Southern Arrow? He had no title or power from birth. He was born as an illegitimate child in a small tribe in the jungle which civilized people dismissed them as backcountry, so even non-civilized people had looked down on him. Fortunately, he was born with some talent, so he had sharpened his teeth, and thanks to that, he was able to succeed in proving himself to the world.At the same time, Southern Arrow had ascended to the heavens through the meteor that had fallen from the sky. Thus, he did not like the concepts of exuviation or transcendence. Unlike those who exuviated or transcended, Southern Arrow had ascended to the heavens and became a constellation all on his own. Thus, he felt that word \u2018ascension\u2019 was more appropriate in describing himself. Hence, he decided to call himself an Ascendant. He had proven himself on earth and was chosen by the heavens. If this was not evidence that indicated his difference from others and his specialness, what could?Having thought this far, Southern Arrow thought,\u00a0\u201cNow that I\u2019ve become a constellation, I want to become the most brilliantly shining star in the night sky. A gigantic star that shines so bright that no other stars compare! Like the sun that turns the night sky into day, if the dark universe becomes filled with my light, what could be greater?\u201dSouthern Arrow acted once he organized his thoughts. By devouring all the remaining stars, he succeeded not only in dyeing the sky\u2019s starlight with his own light, but he also encroached on the universe with his light. And then, his world, which Cha Jeong-woo referred to as #136,888,994,312,545,479, came to an end. His world line had been deleted.***\u2018\u2026What the hell is this?\u2019 Sesha couldn\u2019t help but take a few unconscious steps back as various scenes flashed past her mind.\u00a0Shake\u2026\u00a0Though it was a very brief moment, she had seen many things.The gods and demons that were rapidly annihilated whenever Southern Arrow spread his light, as were various planets and civilizations. Those caught up in this annihilation screamed in confusion. All attempts to resist were in vain. In the end, all of them became raw materials. They were raw material that made the constellation called Southern Arrow more radiant. They had essentially become firewood for Southern Arrow. The baby universe had become a victim of Southern Arrow\u2019s greed even before it had a chance to fully bloom.\u201cHmm\u2026? Hahaha. It seems you\u2019ve seen. You must possess a special \u2018eye\u2019.\u201d Momentarily, Southern Arrow was bewildered when Sesha\u2019s complexion had suddenly turned pale, but he soon realized the reason and burst into laughter.Sesha was terrified of Southern Arrow\u2019s unusually white teeth, which clashed sharply with his dark black face. It seemed that she would be torn apart by those teeth at any moment.Darkness Sphere was Southern Arrow\u2019s illusory world. Naturally, Southern Arrow\u2019s countless legends floated around like spirits in this space, and Sesha happened to glimpse into one of them. Even though she only peeked at some very \u2018minor\u2019 thing, she could tell Southern Arrow\u2019s ruthlessness. She also could tell what would probably happen to her.\u2018The meteorite that allowed the Southern Arrow to become a star\u2026 There was only one fragment that had entered each world line. It seems he\u2019s crossing the world line and entering other universes to swallow the fragments.\u2019And in the process of doing just this, Southern Arrow had learned that there were other \u2018Ascendants\u2019 who were in a similar situation as him. In fact, this should be expected. In the myriad world lines that numbered near infinity, there was no way to stop everyone from realizing the value of these fragments.However, when Southern Arrow met these other Ascendants, he did not try to kill them. He tried to work together with them.Each of them boasted tremendous strength, so if they every fought each other, they would undoubtedly cause tremendous damage to each other. This damage would only hurt them when other Ascendants appeared and hunted them down. Thus, the Ascendants made a non-aggression pact with each other, formed an alliance, and launched a joint operation to find other fragment pieces.There were meteorites all over the place. Some had not yet been found and were ownerless, and even if they had an owner, there was hardly anyone who could defy the Ascendant alliance.The middle-aged man who had chased after Min Chae-young and entrapped Sesha in this place was Southern Arrow. Additionally, the man and woman who appeared with him in Sesha\u2019s school were Ascendants who belonged to the same alliance\u2026 In other words, they were also \u2018stars\u2019. They bore the names Tigris and Solarium respectively.Meteor, a mass of energy that transformed a single mortal into an Ascendant. An almighty being who was reborn as a star to devour the world. Southern Arrow and the other stars and constellations called these meteorites \u2018Star fragments\u2019.Sesha clenched her jaw. \u2018They crossed different dimensions in search of it\u2026so they infiltrated my world line.\u2019The \u2018Star fragment\u2019 that these beings desired was standing next to Sesha. The Star fragment was Min Chae-young.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Soon, Laplace appeared in front of the three.\u300eOhoho, who is this? If it isn\u2019t my master\u2019s father and mother! Laplace humbly greets both\u2026!\u300fLaplace threw his body onto the ground to respectfully greet his master\u2019s parents, but suddenly, the \u2018little wheel\u2019 turned, so he was thrown back in his standing motion. Laplace blinked his eyes. With a tired expression, Kronos spoke aloud while holding onto Scythe. \u201cStop doing that weird stuff! I saw you this morning, so you don\u2019t have to greet me like that!\u201d\u300eOhoho. As expected of our gracious master\u2019s father. You are too considerate and shy.\u300f\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it!\u201dIf he had to pick the being who hated his bizarre behavior the most, Laplace would undoubtedly state Kronos. Ever since he was with Yeon-woo, Kronos wondered why Laplace acted so weird. But recently, it seemed that Laplace was acting more bizarre. And since Yeon-woo was the only one who could rein in Laplace, it seemed Kronos\u2019 son\u2019s absence had given Laplace confidence to act himself. Kronos seriously considered asking Yeon-woo to get rid of Laplace when he returned.\u300eHahaha. Our Kronos-sama is just as kawaii as Sesha-chan.\u300f While saying this, Laplace gave a playful wink\u2026\u201cHusband, stop! Calm down!\u201d\u201cLet go of me! I\u2019m going to kill that bastard today!\u201dKronos lifted Scythe and acted as if he was going to strike Laplace. However, Rhea grabbed him before he could do anything. The more anger Kronos showed, the more Laplace winked, alternating between both eyes. Laplace also started speaking with a lisp.\u300eOoh. I just adore strong men who act manly. Were you trying to run into my arms just a moment ago? Are you sure it\u2019s okay to do so in front of your wife, Rhea?\u300f\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d Kronos swung Scythe back and forth.\u2018\u2026what a shit show.\u2019 Sesha pressed her temple with her index fingers. After meeting Kronos and Rhea, all the tension she had felt before was relieved, but because of Laplace, Sesha started feeling annoyed. It was always like this. Whenever Laplace appeared, it felt like something was being twisted.\u201cUgh\u2026! How did you come here anyway? What happened to the guy you were facing?\u201dLaplace had clearly been facing another being. Fearing that Earth might be adversely affected by their fight, Kronos and Rhea had rushed over to help him out. However, Laplace had come to them, so they wondered what had happened.Laplace groaned as he tightened his pectoral muscles.\u300eAhem! I exemplified my greatness once more!\u300f\u201c\u2026Just state the truth.\u201d\u300eHahaha! Was it that obvious?\u300f\u201cDon\u2019t laugh like that. It\u2019s creepy.\u201d\u300eFufufu?\u300f Laplace winked as he brought his index and middle finger up to the corner of his eye.Sesha\u2019s eyes soon turned lifeless, like a fish\u2019s eyes. \u201c\u2026Grandfather.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIs it possible to kill him?\u201d\u201cIt is possible!\u201d Kronos immediately lifted Scythe high above him and slammed it down on the crown of Laplace\u2019s head. But before the strike was completed, Laplace had zipped back into Sesha\u2019s shadow. Scythe swung harmlessly in the space where Laplace was just a moment ago.Seeing her granddaughter and husband\u2019s defeated look, Rhea sighed. It was only then that Rhea noticed that Min Chae-young was blankly staring at Sesha and Kronos. \u2018Her gaze is full of envy. There are a variety of other emotions mixed in as well. Relief, anxiety, nervousness, concern\u2026 Although she feels relieved to have escaped the enemies\u2019 grasp, she seems worried that Kronos and I might blame her for what happened.\u2019\u2018No one was injured. Thank goodness\u2026 But, all of this happened because of me, right? What will they do to me? I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to say something bad. A monster appeared and did all this. I had nothing to do with it. These people almost got hurt because of me, so they\u2019ll probably hate me\u2026 Probably more than hate. They\u2019ll detest and be resentful of me. They\u2019ll avoid me from now on, right? They\u2019ll probably scold me first. I was just getting to know the others and becoming friends with them\u2026 but I\u2019ve lost everyone once more. Still, it\u2019s nice to see that they all have a good relationship with each other. Is that what it means to be a family? Only if I had such a family\u2026 That would have been nice.\u2019 Min Chae-young\u2019s vestige thoughts rushed out and were felt by the others.As she looked at Sesha and her family with a somewhat jealous gaze, Min Chae-young belatedly realized Rhea\u2019s gaze. Min Chae-young was startled and hurriedly turned her head to the side to avoid eye contact. Trembling, as if she had made a big mistake, Min Chae-young cautiously glanced at Rhea.\u2018\u2026This child.' Rhea seemed to understand why Min Chae-young was reacting as she was. Rhea bit her lower lip, quietly reached out her hand, and pulled Min Chae-young in for a hug. Min Chae-young was startled.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u300c\u2026!\u300d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u300c\u2026\u300dMin Chae-young soon regained her composure after being startled by Rhea\u2019s warm touch. Then, after a while\u2026 Min Chae-young pursed her lips. While carefully looking at Rhea, Min Chae-young asked,\u300cYou\u2019re\u2026not planning on scolding me?\u300d\u201cHuh? Me? Why would I scold you?\u201d\u300cBecause, those monsters came because of me\u2026!\u300d\u201cWhy is it because of you? If anyone is in the wrong, it\u2019s those monsters. You did nothing wrong. They were the bad guys.\u201d\u300c\u2026!\u300dMin Chae-young\u2019s eyes widened to the size of large saucers. She did not expect such a response. Min Chae-young had lived a life where she was always resented by her family members. She had always been told that everything bad that happened occurred because of her. Chae-young had never heard a response like the one Rhea just gave.\u201cYou\u2019re so pretty, how can I scold you? Actually, I wanted to thank you for helping to protect my granddaughter.\u201dDrop. Drop.\u00a0Tears flowed down from the corners of Min Chae-young\u2019s eyes. As if the winter snow was melting in the spring, the tears that she had been holding back for so long rushed out. Empathizing, Rhea cried as well.* * *After Sesha\u2019s group left, a dark shadow quietly approached the school. Originally, it was a place that was almost destroyed by the three Stars\u2019 attack. But since Kronos rewound the \u2018little wheel\u2019 and restored the school to its original state, the school stood as if nothing had happened. The shadow stood at the place where a fierce battle had just taken place a few moments ago.Sss\u2026\u00a0The shadow slowly took shape, Tigris. After quarreling with Laplace, Kronos and Rhea had appeared, and once Kronos had rewound the \u2018little wheel\u2019, he was rematerialized in this place.\u201cStupid bastards.\u201dTsk!\u00a0Tigris clicked his tongue. His mocking words were directed at the dead Southern Arrow and Solarium.\u201cI explained to them many times that this world line is dangerous. Well, their low intelligence was why they couldn\u2019t enter the top eighty-eight ranking Stars.\u201dMultiple and parallel universes were not all the same. There were also ratings of world lines. Deus Ex Machina numbered the world lines according to the order in which each world line was differentiated or born, and the ranks tended to decrease as the number progressed. Of course, even in the latter numbered world lines, there were many cases where a special mutation occurred in that universe and outperformed the previous numbered world lines, but most of the time, the rating sequence usually corresponded to a world line\u2019s number.Therefore, the place designated as \u2018#0\u2019, which was the source of all world lines, was a place that even the Stars could not easily reach. This world line, otherwise called the \u2018original\u2019, was where the universe originally existed in the form of a \u2018wheel\u2019. This \u2018#0\u2019 world line contained the Tower, and the Heavenly Demon and Black King, who vied against each other over the control of the entire universe. It was also the place where the Black King took on his present identity and where the nonsensical being called Deus Ex Machina was born. Kronos and Rhea were the parents of two such twins.\u201cEven though I explained to them that it wasn\u2019t the time to reveal our identities to Deus Ex Machina\u2026 Did they think it would be easy to defeat Kronos and Rhea? What the hell happened to the Stars?\u201dTigris marveled at the idiocy of the defeated Stars. The two stars went up against the parents who gave birth to the Black King and Deus Ex Machina. If one had any common sense, one would have avoided these beings. No, they probably did have such thoughts.However, they had become drunk with the confidence of being a \u2018Star\u2019, so their pride blinded them from the obvious. In the beginning, the Stars were like that. They were beings who could not distinguish between bravery, generosity, and pride. Their confidence was a part of their being, as they grew up being victorious in all their pursuits, ever since they were mortals to their positions as Stars.\u201cWell, thanks to their idiocy, I was able to survive.\u201dTigris felt confident that, if the Stars could become more focused and discerning, they would have a chance to become greater beings. Even now, unexpectedly, he would be able to devour a delicious delicacy.Sss\u2026!\u00a0Tigris waved his hand in the air. Then, a gust of wind blew and swept past the entire school, revealing various vestiges that were forced to reveal themselves as they slumped onto the ground.\u2018Tigris\u2026! You\u2019re alive! Hurry! Come save us!\u2019Stars did not easily become annihilated. When their starlight dimmed, the sparks of their starlight remained. Thus, they could be resurrected at any time. It was because their foundation was rooted in the \u2018Star Fragments\u2019. They shone light with those fragments. This was why they called themselves the Stars.It was a different concept of existence when compared to gods, who derived their power based on faith. These gods were destined to disappear if there were no followers or believers remaining. Gods could not shine or exist on their own. This was why the Stars referred to gods and demons as parasites that lived trivial lives. However, if one\u2019s Star Fragments were taken away, the Star would disappear as well.Tigris looked at Southern Arrow and Solarium, who were begging him to save them quickly, but did not respond to them. Tigris just opened his mouth wide. The corners of his mouth seemingly rose to his ears as he lowered his chin. His serrated, sharp teeth could clearly be seen.\u2018You\u2026 You\u2026!\u2019\u2018Ack! No\u2026 No\u2026!\u2019Southern Arrow and Solarium\u2019s expressions turned pale. Belatedly, they realized what Tigris was trying to do. They tried to run away, but they could not. Kronos and Rhea had nearly snuffed out their starlight, so their ability to do something was greatly restricted.Gulp!\u00a0Tigris swallowed both at once. Tearing screams could be heard echoing in the background. Tigris could feel the two vestiges wriggling in his mouth, but he did not care. Tigris was just happy to have acquired two additional Star Fragments. Instead of immediately swallowing, he savored the Star Fragments in his mouth. Taste, satiety, and satisfaction\u2026 The Star Fragments fulfilled all these qualities.For a moment, Tigris seemed to understand why the top eighty-eight ranking Stars devoured other Star Fragments whenever they had the chance. \u2018I think I may become addicted to this feeling\u2026 Hahaha!\u2019If one only devoured the Star Fragment, then only one\u2019s light would brighten, but if one devoured the entire constellation, as Tigris did, one would consume the legends that the constellation had developed and gathered over the years, so the feeling of euphoria was that much greater.Currently, Tigris was peering into snippets of Southern Arrow and the Solarium\u2019s past experiences, and he started acquiring all the powers they had built up over the years. As their souls were assimilating into one\u2026 Tigris became the Southern Arrow and Solarium. And after returning to his state as Tigris, he became a Tigris with a higher rank. The present Tigris was a completely different entity from the Tigris of the past.Tigris was now a Large Star. He had not become a Great Star, but he had now gained the capability to stand shoulder to shoulder with the top eighty-eight ranking Stars. He felt an infinite sense of omnipotence in his fingertips.\u201cThe alliance sent us here to collect the Star Fragment, but they also wanted us to take a closer look at the state of the world line\u2026 I must fulfill my duty as a forward scout.\u201d Tigris did not allow himself to feel intoxicated with a sense of omnipotence. Instead, he tried to restrict the feeling as much as possible. It was because he did not know when Kronos and Rhea would appear, and it was still necessary to hide his newfound powers from other Stars. And, if possible\u2026 Tigris also wanted to somehow get his hands on the Star Fragment within this world line.A Star Fragment from the original world line\u2026 If he could somehow get his hands on that, Tigris would almost certainly stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the other Great Stars. Perhaps, if he could somehow devour Kronos and Rhea as well, Tigris could aim for an even higher perch. Of course, this was just fanciful daydreaming, as Tigris did not intend to search for the two existences. However, that did not stop him from thinking of the \u2018if\u2019.In this respect, Tigris was a natural hunter who knew the importance of waiting better than anyone else.Sss\u2026\u00a0Tigris seeped into the shadows again. Like a shark moving quietly from the depths to snatch its prey, he moved carefully under the shadows.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although their numbers were fewer than dwarves, elves, and other races, each member was a powerful player that allowed the tribe to overcome its disadvantage in numbers.Even large clans did not try to clash with the One-horned tribe, and the One-horned tribe chose to be neutral in the policies of the Tower, so they distanced themselves from the player world. In short, the One-horned tribe was always peaceful.\u201cSo that\u2019s why we should\u2026!\u201d\u201cArgh, let\u2019s just raise it! Why do none of you listen! This is why you shouldn\u2019t speak to boomers!\u201d\u201cWhat, punk? Boomer? I\u2019m the one who changed your diapers because you couldn\u2019t use the toilet until you were five, and you dare to say that?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bring up the past! Or else I\u2019m going to tell everyone how you confessed to my Aunt Bruna twenty years ago and cried for days after being rejected!\u201d\u201cYou son of a bitch!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m my mother and father\u2019s son!\u201dAgain, the One-horned tribe was a peaceful group. They fought often amongst each other because they were all warlike, but although the village was loud, it was peaceful.\u201cYou punk, get out here! I\u2019ll fix your manners today.\u201d\u201cHa. You think I\u2019m scared of you? I\u2019m going to cut off your horn and make it into a flute, so stay warned!\u201d\u201cOoh. Looks like those two are finally gonna throw punches!\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing, guys! Hurry up and get up! And you, wipe your drool! Let\u2019s go to the training grounds!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a fight!\u201d\u201cAnother fight!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s pandemonium!\u201dIt had been a conference discussing important matters of the village until just moments ago, but it soon turned into a battle of honor between two of the elders who had the most conflicting ideas.\u2018\u2026Is this really okay?\u2019 Edora watched the tribe members run out of the conference area kicking up dust clouds, and she sighed.In truth, there wasn\u2019t actually really much of a reason why they started fighting. When they had village conferences, the agenda items were about how many puppies there were in the newest litter, needing more fertilizer because of a drought, or holding a rain ceremony because there had been light rain days before. They were all common matters that could be seen in the countryside. There was nothing for them to do, so the only source of fun was tossing punches at each other.Edora firmly believed the One-horned tribe was so advanced in martial arts because they had nothing to do. She felt exasperated on too often an occasion seeing the careless and simple way of life actually worked.\u2018Father sets the prime example.\u2019 Edora narrowed her eyes and glared at the Martial King, Nayu, who was sitting in a corner of the conference room.Zzzzz, phooo. Zzzzz.\u00a0The Martial King was sleeping blatantly. He impressively managed to keep himself upright in the chair, but the way he snored with his arms crossed\u2026 Edora couldn\u2019t help but furrow her eyebrows. Moreover, on his nose, there was a snot bubble that shrank and grew as he breathed.The Head Elder, who was standing next to him, looked at the Martial King with an irked expression. \u201cHey, hey, Chief. Chief!\u201d\u201cH-Huhhh? Is something happening\u2026?\u201dIt was only after someone on his way out of the conference room shook the Martial King that he finally woke up. The Martial King blinked as he looked around in confusion.\u201cThere\u2019s a fight going on. You\u2019re not going?\u201d\u201cHm? A fight?\u201d\u201cDuh, that\u2019s what I said. Pacho and Desley are going at it.\u201d\u201cOho? Oooh. I\u2019m not one to miss such an amusing event.\u201d\u2018You can surely afford to miss such things, can\u2019t you?\u2019 Edora barely contained herself from speaking her thoughts. A tribal chief who was more interested in a fight than the matters of the tribe\u2026 She couldn\u2019t believe that the Martial King was considered to be leading the One-horned tribe\u2019s new golden age.The Head Elder, also unable to take it any longer, was about to say something and took a deep breath. \u201c\u2026Hm?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d The Martial King giggled and stood up to go to the training grounds when he suddenly turned in a different direction with a stiff face. The Head Elder became grave, also feeling something odd.\u201c\u2026?\u201d Edora tilted her head, not understanding.Phoosh! Pat.\u00a0The Martial King and the Head Elder suddenly disappeared together.Just then, the Psychic Medium\u2019s voice rang in Edora\u2019s ears.\u300eFollow your father.\u300f\u201cMom? What\u2019s\u2026?\u201d\u300eThe heavens are changing. Something has definitely happened\u2026 I can\u2019t see what it is from here.\u300fEdora\u00a0widened her eyes, surprised that there was something her mother didn\u2019t know. Her mother was able to reach the laws of causality because she was blessed by Shaojao Jintian, and she could extract any information she wanted from it. She was the closest to omniscience in the lower world\u2026 No, even in the heavenly world. But now that her mother didn\u2019t know something, Edora felt chills run down her spine.\u300eAnd\u2026\u300fThere was something else?\u300eFrom some time ago, I haven't felt Kahn. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s disappeared.\u300f\u201c\u2026!\u201dAnd that was enough.\u2018Just what\u2026\u2019 Edora dashed to where the Martial King and the Head Elder were. Her mind was filled with anxious thoughts. \u2018Just what did you do this time to make me so anxious again, oraboni?\u2019* * *\u201cOoh. Oooooh! They\u2019re coming!\u201d Phante, to be exact, the Phante who came from the \u201cfuture\u201d became excited as he felt a powerful energy speed toward him. It was almost comical the way he cheered with a black eye, but Phante was more joyful and serious than ever. This would be a reunion with his father he never thought he\u2019d see again! It was the moment he had been waiting for so long.After the Tower was toppled, Phante naturally became the king of the One-horned tribe amid all the confusion. He had gone through many hurdles in the process of establishing a new village. Ultimately, everything was settled well, and the One-horned quickly returned to their glory days, but the shadow of the Martial King always followed Phante around. Due to this, he developed both love and hate for the Martial King.Phante truly loved and respected his father, but the Martial King was also an irresponsible king who left after putting such a large burden on his shoulders. Even though it was said Phante led the One-horned tribe into a new age, he wasn\u2019t able to surpass the Martial King. And so, Phante wanted to prove that he was greater than his father. The path he walked on until now was different and better than his father\u2019s!Crackle, crackle! Krrrr\u2026!\u00a0The blood-red lightning that began to appear from Phante\u2019s feet immediately covered his entire body. It was Blood Lightning, a skill the Head Elder had created. After Phante developed it, it became a more advanced version of the One-horned tribe\u2019s greatest martial art. Phante wanted to review powers one more time before facing the Martial King.\u201c\u2026Hmm?\u201d The Martial King made a strange expression after arriving where Yeon-woo and Phante were.The Head Elder had a similar reaction. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026!\u201d\u201cSeems like your martial art, old man.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t just seem like it\u2026 It\u00a0is\u00a0Blood Lightning. But\u2026! It\u2019s more advanced. Myriad Lightning\u2026 I\u2019ve envisioned it in my head, but I never imagined I\u2019d actually see it.\u201dMyriad Lightning was the greatest secret weapon of Blood Lightning. It was a power that covered the entire world with blood-red lightning. The moment the ability meant to destroy was activated, a great disaster would befall the world. Right now, the lightning surrounding Phante wasn\u2019t Myriad Lightning. However, the trigger to activate it was prepared.The Head Elder was surprised the final skill he had always pictured in his mind was materialized in front of him. At the same time, he questioned whether the person in front of him was really a human. There was definitely no such powerful person in their tribe\u2026 He wondered if this person had developed this ability outside of the village, but he didn\u2019t see how that was possible. Such a powerful player would\u2019ve already become famous in the Tower.However, if the young Phante grew up, he would probably look like that. Then\u2026it seemed the person had some blood relation to the Martial King. The Head Elder also didn\u2019t understand how someone he didn\u2019t know had so perfectly mastered Blood Lightning. \u201cSomeone like that should be known in one way or the other, but I have no idea who he is. Is he my senior who retired in the past? But\u2026\u201d\u201cOld man. Have you lost your sight with your age?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you tell just by looking? That\u2019s\u2026\u201d A corner of the Martial King\u2019s mouth lifted.Krrrrr.\u00a0At the same time, the ground quaked violently. The laws of gravity were canceled as the Martial King raised his power. Rocks on the ground began to float.\u201cPhante.\u201d\u201cPhante\u2026? What are you talking about? They might look similar, but that man is\u2026!\u201d\u201cStrong, yes. But that\u2019s Phante. The brat at our village will probably be like that when he\u2019s grown up.\u201d\u201c\u2026Does that mean the wheel\u2019s been turned?\u201d\u201cProbably?\u201d\u201cHuh!\u201d The Head Elder laughed in disbelief. The wheel was a concept he had only heard about. Only heavenly beings who were supreme gods or creators could attempt to touch it, but the future Phante had used it to come here\u2026 Wondering what he was supposed to make of this, the Head Elder was at a loss for words.However, as if he already realized what had happened, the Martial King looked past the crackling Phante at the being standing quietly behind him and smirked. Yeon-woo, his disciple, was there. However, he was entirely different from the Yeon-woo he knew.Even the Martial King couldn\u2019t approximate how powerful his disciple was. The Psychic Medium said Yeon-woo suddenly disappeared, but she was wrong. He hadn\u2019t disappeared; he\u2019d just grown too large to be perceived\u2026 Just as people didn\u2019t perceive the air around them because it was such a natural occurrence, Yeon-woo wasn\u2019t able to be perceived.\u2018No. To be exact, he\u2019s something more fundamental than air. He\u2019s\u2026the world itself.\u2019 The Martial King couldn\u2019t help but laugh since his disciple had returned so differently in the span of a day. \u201cI have no way of knowing what the two of you went through.\u201dSwish.\u00a0The aura around the Martial King began to whirl. The blood-red lightning that sizzled like it was going to burn him has pushed away.The Head Elder moved back far away, clicking his tongue and thinking of how messy this place would become. Phante itched for a fight again when he realized his father was more powerful than he realized.\u201cYou must\u2019ve gone through a lot.\u201d Even so, the Martial King\u2019s words sent ripples through Phante and Yeon-woo\u2019s hearts. Although the Martial King always had to have his way and made them frustrated, they had missed his warm words. The Martial King added, \u201cAnd thank you. For not forgetting about me and coming to see me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNeither Yeon-woo nor Phante could say anything. The Martial King\u2019s smile widened, saying, \u201cSo I\u2019ll fight you with everything I have, son. Disciple. This is what you wanted, isn\u2019t it? As a welcoming greeting, I\u2019ll have you rolling around on the ground.\u201dWith that, the Martial King dashed forward. Phante also pulled the trigger for his Myriad Lighting.\u00a0Rumble! Krrr, kra, kra, kra.\u00a0Instantly, their surroundings were destroyed. Just then\u2026\u201cOraboni!\u201d Yeon-woo whipped his head in the direction of the voice, one that he missed as much as the Martial King\u2019s. The face he so desperately wanted to see was there. It was Edora.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 35": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Second Life RankerCH ss - 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 31 - Sesha (6)\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s really music playing!\u201d\u201cDid anyone see anyone go inside the school?\u201d\u201cN-No, sir!\u201dThe staff members began to murmur. Before the camera started rolling, they had confirmed that there was no one left on campus aside from the teacher who was on guard duty. To get inside the school from the front entrance, people had to walk through the field, so it was impossible to get inside without being seen by the staff. Also, the school was located on a hill, so it wasn\u2019t possible to climb over the back gates and sneak in.\u201cMove the camera! Zoom! Zoom in!\u201d Even with the creepy situation, Producer Kim realized that this was an opportunity. It didn\u2019t matter whether or not there was a real ghost. He only knew that a big hit was right in front of him.There was a saying among singers that their song would be a big hit when the sound of a ghost was recorded during their session. It was unlikely the same jinx existed with idol reality shows, but everything depended on how Producer Kim wrapped this up\u2026 Exploring a scary school with famous idols Shin Sung-chan and Cha So-yeong! He could already smell the money rolling in.The cameraman swallowed and zoomed in to the music room as Producer Kim ordered. The soft chords of a piano from the illuminated classroom were carried by the wind. F\u00fcr Elise\u2026was a piano composition written by Beethoven in 1810. It was a soft melody that everyone was familiar with, but the cameraman couldn\u2019t help but shiver. \u201c\u2026Hup!\u201d Then, he unintentionally gasped. He could see a human figure passing through the curtained window. \u201cP-Person!\u201d\u201cSomeone\u2019s\u2026 really there?\u201dThe issue was that the visible human shadow was walking differently from how normal people did. Usually, when people walked, their heads slightly bobbed up and down. However, the shadow\u2019s head was unmoving while walking, as if sliding across ice. It looked like it had no legs.\u201cI-It\u2019s looking this way.\u201dGulp.\u00a0Shin Sung-chan swallowed. Just a few moments ago, he had been determined to score points with Sesha by showing his impressive side, but he looked extremely pale now. A drop of sweat dripped down his forehead.Cameraman number one, who was filming Shin Sung-chan, didn\u2019t miss how his eyelids trembled. It was well-known that Sung-chan was the youngest in his group, but it was also common knowledge that he was a scaredy-cat. Apparently, he hated ghosts the most in the world.According to what the other members said, they had all gone to an amusement park together once, and Sung-chan was the only one to sit out the horror house. They wanted to force him inside, but their youngest looked as if was going to faint, so they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to do it.Producer Kim hadn\u2019t chosen the topic of this episode as exploring the school\u2019s mystery for nothing. \u201cFilming Sung-chan\u2019s daily school life\u201d was only a ploy. And just as the producer predicted, Sung-chan was noticeably shaking to the point that the cameraman wondered if he should stop filming.\u201c\u2026Hmm?\u201d Cameraman number one made an inquisitive sound.Sesha was striding by Sung-chan. She was calm, not looking scared in the slightest.Producer Kim spun his finger in the air, telling Sesha\u2019s cameraman and scriptwriter to quickly follow her.\u201cYou\u2019re not coming?\u201dSung-chan jumped to attention at Sesha\u2019s question. Behind Sesha, Park Yoo-min was grinning like a cat who got the cream. She looked like she was asking him if he could still score points in this situation.\u2018Hey, don\u2019t show your weak side!\u2019 Sung-chan steeled his resolve and straightened his back. \u201cO-Of course not. I am. That\u2019s probably just a trick the staff is playing on us to scare us. Ha, hahaha.\u201d He was laughing, but his voice was shaking.Tremble, tremble.* * *Tap, tap.\u00a0Only the sound of footsteps could be heard in the dark and quiet hallway. Students had been bustling in here just hours ago, but it was now silent as if that had only been a dream.Sesha stood at the front, with Yoo-min following her, and Sung-chan was at the very end. Sung-chan wanted to power forward confidently, but he couldn\u2019t because his legs were shaking too much. The act of entering this place alone required a lot from him. On the other hand, Sesha looked unaffected. The three were all being filmed in the camera as they moved forward.\u2018Today\u2019s filming is gonna be incredible.\u2019 Producer Kim was confident.Sesha, who looked as if nothing could faze her and was cool and collected even in this scary situation, Sung-chan, who was passionate on stage but awkward and clumsy at school, and Yoo-min, who was watching the other two with amusement\u2026 The combination of the three was brilliant. And the friend Sesha had brought along looked good in the camera, and she was witty. She would probably be scouted by a bunch of places after this episode was broadcast.\u201cWhoa.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Sesha tilted her head at Yoo-min\u2019s random exclamation.\u201cBecause you look cool.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not scared of ghosts?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m more scared of monsters.\u201dIt was an answer that only players could give.\u201cHa. I bet the monsters were more scared of you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why?\u201dAs they chattered, they soon arrived at the music room. F\u00fcr Elise was now over, and the piano was now playing\u00a0Piano Concerto No. 5.\u00a0Apparently, the ghost enjoyed Beethoven.\u2018Do you sense anything?\u2019\u300cHuhuhuhu. No,\u300d\u2018The shadow from earlier, could it just be a trick by the staff?\u2019\u300cI would\u2019ve told you then.\u300dLaplace sighed.\u300cWell, I\u2019ll be able to closely scan the music room, so even if the creature runs away I can catch him right away.\u300dSesha nodded slightly so Laplace could see and put her hand on the handle to the music room. \u201cI\u2019m opening it now.\u201dPark Yoo-min nodded, and Shin Sung-chan swallowed.Creak.\u00a0The door opened. However\u2026\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026?\u201d\u201cHeeek!\u201dSesha and Park Yoo-min widened their eyes. Sung-chan gasped and closed his eyes. When the other two stayed quiet, Sung-chan peeked open an eye and turned surprised.\u201cT-There\u2019s no one here\u2026?\u201dThe music room was bright, and the piano cover was open as if someone had just been playing it.\u2018Check the back door carefully.\u2019\u300cHaa, haa, haa! Such a cold voice\u2026 Commands\u2026 I\u2019m so happy.\u300dCrack!\u00a0Sesha gritted her teeth at Laplace, who was clearly unable to read the room. She urgently felt the desire to beg her grandfather to get rid of him when she returned home.Sesha and her friends carefully examined the music room. The music had stopped the moment they reached the door. Only silence filled the room now, but the suspense that something might suddenly pop out kept the atmosphere tense. The staff members who followed them swallowed nervously.\u201cThere really isn\u2019t anything?\u201d Sesha wrinkled her forehead and became deep in thought. She had looked in every nook and cranny in the cubbies and beneath all the desks, even looking behind the TV, but there was nothing there. Not a single speck of dust. She wondered if something had left the classroom, but Laplace informed her there wasn\u2019t. Just then\u2026\u201cA-Ahhhhh!\u201d Shin Sung-chan suddenly screamed and fell backward. Sesha, Park Yoo-min, and all the staff turned to him. He yelled, \u201cO-O-O-Over there\u2026!\u201dShin Sung-chan trembled and pointed his index finger. Beyond the window that looked out into the hallway, something was slowly moving.\u00a0Thump! Thump!\u00a0Each step it took made the hallway quake.\u201cAaack!\u201d\u201cEeeeek!\u201d\u201cW-What is that?\u201d\u201cIs it really a ghost\u2026?!\u201dThe staff, who were supposed to stay quiet, began to clamor in surprise. What was passing by the hallway was the statue of King Sejong, which should\u2019ve been standing dignified in the middle of the schoolyard.The statue of King Sejong that was looking through the book of Hunminjeongeum paused in its steps. Then, it slowly turned its head toward the music room. The people all looked at the statue.\u00a0Grin!\u00a0The statue of King Sejong raised a corner of its mouth as if it found the people cute.But to the people, the statue just looked unsettling.\u00a0Eeeek! Ahhhh!\u00a0Gasps and screams could be heard throughout the room. The filming was nearly forgotten.The statue of King Sejong made a sad face, upset that the people were scared of it, then it turned back to its book and continued walking.\u00a0Thump! Thump!\u00a0Contrary to its confident self earlier, it now looked like a wet dog standing in rain. The statue was quite expressive with its emotions.\u2018Pervert bunny!\u2019\u300cHaa, haa, haa. Roger that! Cute and adorable bunny to the rescue!\u300dWith a shout that sounded like it came from the anime he was watching these days, Laplace separated from Sesha\u2019s shadow and quickly slid under the door.Sesha quickly burst open the door and stepped into the hallway. Then, she saw it\u2014the many statues that filled the hallway.Thump, thump. Clunk, clunk. Kiaaak! Kaaak!\u00a0It wasn\u2019t just the statue of King Sejong. The statue of Yi Sun-sin was training his sword skills, repeatedly striking down its sword from where it was standing, and two skeletons from the science labs were in the middle of a bizarre dance battle\u2026 Sesha questioned whether she was dreaming or not.And that wasn\u2019t all of it. There was a bony skeleton singing with a microphone it got from who-knew-where, and in front of it, dolls that the students had brought were jumping up and down like fans at a concert. Model archaeopteryxes that used to decorate the ceiling powerfully thrust their wings.There was nothing normal about the scene. Wasn\u2019t there a word for situations like this? Shitshow.\u300cWhoaaaa. What a shitshow.\u300dIf even Laplace was calling this a shitshow, this was really bad.\u2018You said you didn\u2019t feel anything. How could you not know when they\u2019re all gathered like that?\u2019\u300cRight. I really didn\u2019t feel anything.\u300dLaplace laughed in disbelief.\u300cThe problem is\u2026 Even with all this ruckus, I still don\u2019t sense anything.\u300d\u2018What?\u2019 Sesha wondered if that was even possible.\u300cIt\u2019s completely out of my range of recognition\u2026 Hmm.\u300dLaplace was silent. It seemed like his pride was hurt. The shadow that used to be shaped like Sesha was now shaped like a bunny.\u300cOh well.\u300dSuddenly, from what appeared to be Laplace\u2019s eyes, red lights flashed.\u00a0Flinch!\u00a0Sesha subconsciously stepped backward. This was it\u2014the reason Laplace wasn\u2019t someone to be looked down upon. He was probably trying to conceal his power to the best of his abilities, but a god of disorder that could easily swallow the entire Earth could make living beings shake in fear just by existing.\u300cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll learn something after eating them all up, right?\u300dKeekeekee.\u00a0Laplace\u2019s sharp canines glinted from his open mouth. Sesha swallowed. Something bad was on the verge of happening.* * *Then, a moment later\u2026\u300cEveryone, may I have your attention, please! Please look at the cute and adorable bunny! This is my lovely breakdance!\u300dA topless copper-skinned middle-aged man with bunny ears on his sparkling bald head was showing off his dance moves in the festival of statues, flexing his chest and biceps.\u201c\u2026I shouldn\u2019t have believed in that idiot.\u201d Sesha covered her face with her hand.Meanwhile, the copper-skinned man\u2019s dance continued, chests and biceps still flexing.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever seen such a wonderful statue!\u201d\u201cI put some effort behind it.\u201dIn a conference room located inside the village hall of the One-horn Tribe, there was a long table extending in the center of the hall. The Martial King and Henova were laughing out loud as they found everything so much fun.\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cCould you also\u2026\u201dHenova tilted his head with a curious expression, causing the Martial King to let his voice trail off. But soon, Henova realized the meaning of the Martial King\u2019s words and smiled broadly. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d\u201cOh! Our esteemed Henova is so skilled and thoughtful.\u201d\u201cIt should be bigger and grander in scale than the groom and bride\u2019s statue, no?\u201d\u201cThen, if possible, it should be about one or three times larger. Place it in the tribe\u2019s central area and set up a monument and a fountain next to it\u2026!\u201d\u201cFather! Please stop!\u201d While listening to their conversation, Edora was unable to bear the shame any longer. She screamed out and cut off her father. Her face had already turned beet red.From wedding invitations to statues, her clan members\u2019 efforts and commemoration of her wedding drove Edora crazy. If they were going to play a prank, then they should know how far they should go, but what the heck is this\u2026! The problem for Edora was that no one seemed to share her concern.On the contrary, everyone justified their nonsensical conclusions and actions by stating that \u2018good things are good\u2019, \u2018the princess is just shy\u2019, and \u2018we\u2019re doing what you would want us to do\u2019. And it was the same with the Martial King. He was not only pleased with the events that were taking place, but he was also fanning the flames.Just seeing the embarrassing statue being erected made Edora\u2019s skin crawl, but now her father wanted to erect an even larger statue! No matter how great a person was, how could one be so arrogant and self-centered? Just the idea of another statue was driving her nuts, but now he was going on about building a fountain and memorial park\u2026Shatter. Edora felt as though the sky would soon collapse on her.\u2018I\u2019m going to break it! Every statue will be destroyed\u2026!\u2019 Edora grasped Divine Evil tightly. She was ready to jump out from her seat at any moment and destroy all the damn statues.Of course, the Martial King did not become fazed from his daughter\u2019s sudden outburst.\u2018Do something!\u2019 With a burning gaze, Edora looked towards Yeon-woo.However, Yeon-woo was in a blank state of mind, as if he had given up. No, to be precise, his eyes were completely unfocused. Perhaps it was because he was still processing the psychological shock he had just experienced.\u2018Should I wind up the \u2018wheel\u2019 and propose again? Or perhaps, I should just descend in my true form and destroy the entire Tower\u2026!\u2019 Yeon-woo had managed to suppress the urge to flip everything over several times already that day. If it had not been for the considerable magic power and law of causality to turn the \u2018wheel\u2019, he would have already gone back and changed everything.\u2018\u2026if I make a mistake while turning the \u2018wheel\u2019, I might negatively affect the Martial King\u2019s existence as well\u2026\u2019 Yeon-woo knew that his hands were tied. For this reason, Yeon-woo had no choice but to put up with the situation.While he was brewing inside, Henova and the Martial King continued their merry chatter.\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that everyone likes it. In fact, I was worried that I might not be able to meet the deadline.\u201d\u201cHmm? Deadline? I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve even set a date yet.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t they? Haven\u2019t the wedding invitations already been sent out?\u201d\u201cThat was just the first wave.\u201d\u201cThe first wave? There\u2019s going to be a second and third wave?\u201d\u201cOf course! We\u2019re talking about Nayu\u2019s daughter and my disciple marrying each other! The first meeting will be a short get-together with the intention that everyone should prepare bridal gifts. The second meeting will be the engagement ceremony, and the third meeting will be\u2026!\u201d\u201cFather! Are you really going to be like this\u2026?!\u201d Wondering just how many more shameful acts her father was planning, Edora had already placed one foot on the table and had half pulled out Divine Evil. Her sharpened eyes, filled with anger and embarrassment, warned her father that she was willing to swing her sword immediately if he spoke any further.When the Martial King saw the reaction of his daughter, he burst into laughter. Every time he took a stab at her, Edora reacted so violently that he could not help himself from continuing. The Martial King\u2019s secret hobby was to playfully bully his own daughter. The Psychic Medium shook her head and muttered underneath her breath that her husband was acting immature, but the Martial King still found it hard to stop teasing his daughter.Still, if he continued, the Martial King felt he may go beyond a sense of teasing and really hurt his daughter\u2019s feelings. Thinking this far, the Martial King took a step back. He was remarkably adept at knowing the boundaries.\u201cAnyway, my disciple.\u201d The Martial King glanced toward his disciple, Yeon-woo, who quietly nodded in acknowledgement. \u201cWhen are you going to introduce your parents? Shouldn\u2019t we have a meeting?\u201dA meet-and-greet between parents\u2026 Hearing these words, Edora quietly lowered her feet from the table and sat back in her chair. For some reason, she felt that her father was not going to create any further commotion.Edora looked toward Yeon-woo as well. As she came to think of it, Edora had never properly greeted Yeon-woo\u2019s parents or met his family. She had met his father, Kronos, as they shared a conversation when Kronos was Vigrid. However, she had never had a proper conversation with Yeon-woo\u2019s mother or younger brother. Of course, she knew that the two had passed away, but knowing that Yeon-woo was trying to save them, she wondered if that purpose had already been achieved.\u2018Besides, the gods of Olympus are also part of his family\u2026 Hmm\u2026 If we\u2019re going to do a meet-and-greet\u2026\u2019 When Edora remembered where Yeon-woo was originally from, she fell silent. For some reason, Edora felt that this \u2018meet-and-greet\u2019 would not simply end with a meeting between the adults of the two families. The One-horned Tribe and Olympus were the two leading forces that ruled over the Tower.\u201cOnly the parents of the bride and groom should meet for a \u2018meet-and-greet\u2019, right?\u201d Yeon-woo thought about it for a moment and then spoke out. If he were to bring along Cha Jeong-woo, then he would also have to bring his other siblings\u2026 And there were quite a few older siblings, and he still had a bad relationship with some of them. This was especially the case for Zeus, who was probably running wild at the moment.\u2018Also, bringing over father and mother\u2026\u2019 Also, Yeon-woo thought about how his parents would possibly react to his sudden announcement of getting married. \u2018I\u2019m sure father will playfully say, \u2018Why are you digging your own grave\u2019\u2019.At the same time, if Yeon-woo\u2019s parents met Edora, it was obvious how the two of them would react.They would laugh and smile with glee. They would love Edora. They would probably welcome her more than himself. His father had already hinted that he really liked Edora.\u201cOkay. We\u2019ll keep it formal and small. Bring only your parents. Or shall I go and get them?\u201dFortunately, the Martial King did not seem too concerned about Yeon-woo\u2019s suggestion.\u201cNo. I\u2019ll bring them over.\u201d\u201cGood. Then do it. We\u2019ll have to prepare the wedding studio for photos, pick out our clothes, make an appointment at salons\u2026 What?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dYeon-woo and the Martial King quickly decided on the wedding preparations.***Beyond the walls of the conference hall, in the next room, there was a person secretly overhearing the conversation.\u201cThe dress is the most important choice. Edora, do you have any good ideas?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it okay if I wear your wedding dress?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea, but there\u2019ll be two weddings, one with outside people and one within our tribe\u2026!\u201d\u201cDo you really want to see me draw my sword!\u201d\u201cOh! Why is my lovely daughter so strung up? This is unavoidable. I\u2019m not kidding, we need to also consider how this will look for the tribe. We must hold a separate tribe ceremony.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 I need two dresses?\u201d\u201cYou could use mine for one, so we just need another. Hmm! We can\u2019t just choose anything. It needs to be something nice and very special.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cOho! It seems you already have something in mind?\u201dThe man, who overheard the entire conversation, slowly removed his ear from the wall.\u201cHahaha!\u201d Phante evilly grinned. In order to not bump into the Phante of this period, this Phante, who came through the turning of the \u2018wheel\u2019, had put his head down and stayed quiet.\u201cWhat I couldn\u2019t do in the previous \u2018wheel\u2019, I\u2019ll do this time.\u201d If he could bring his sister the dress she wanted, Phante\u2019d probably gain some points from Edora in the future. His eyes shone as he became determined to act like a proper older brother.\u201cWait, sister! This older brother of yours shall help you!\u201d***\u201cHow is it?\u201d\u201cThe tea\u2019s scent is very clear.\u201d\u201cIt also has a very refreshing effect on one\u2019s mind. I enjoy it whenever I can.\u201dAfter concluding the preparation planning, Edora left to talk further with her mother, and Henova went back to the blacksmith to make a statue of the Martial King.\u201cHahaha! How do you like my wedding present?\u201dSuddenly, at the end, Yeon-woo remembered what Henova had said with a sly smile. At that time, Yeon-woo pretended not to hear and ignored Henova.Yeon-woo had already made up his mind to destroy all the statues in the middle of the night when there were fewer people around. Since Henova made the statue with his own hands, Yeon-woo thought he might hesitate to destroy it, so Yeon-woo decided that, if he could not destroy it, he would bury it under a mountain somewhere. Such a monstrous thing should not have to exist in this world.After Edora and Henova left, only Yeon-woo and the Martial King remained in the meeting room. When their planning was over, Yeon-woo planned to follow Edora, but Yeon-woo sensed that the Martial King had something to say, so he stayed back. Yeon-woo tilted his head, wondering what the Martial King had to say, and quietly put down the teacup that the Martial King offered him.At that moment, Yeon-woo saw the Martial King\u2019s eyes sharpen. It was different from the playfulness that had filled his eyes earlier. The Martial King seemed to be deep in thought. Was it because of that? Yeon-woo seemed to know what the Martial King was going to say.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you tell me now?\u201dThe Martial King still spoke in a light tone. However, Yeon-woo was able to read the weight contained in those few words. Just as Yeon-woo expected, it was about \u2018that\u2019.\u201cIf you ask without properly introducing the subject matter\u2026\u201dStill, Yeon-woo pretended to be confused.Laugh.\u00a0The Martial King smirked as if Yeon-woo\u2019s response was ridiculous. \u201cIt\u2019s written all over your face\u2026 Do you think I\u2019ll be deceived if you say that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYesterday, the Psychic Medium stated a new divination.\u201dYeon-woo shut his mouth, as he expected what would come next.\u201cElimination. No matter how many times we reviewed the divination, we came to that singular message. Nothing has changed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I say this, you may think I\u2019m whipped, but I have absolute confidence in my wife\u2019s skills. The divination is most likely correct. Why? Because she\u2019s the one I love and trust the most.\u201dThe One-horned Tribe consisted of a total of fifty families and clans united into one \u2018tribe\u2019. At that time, a person who was appointed as a patriarch or king had to marry the wives from each of those fifty families and clans in turn. Furthermore, the patriarch or king had the duty to have at least one child in his relationship with each of them. In this way, the children born would fight for the next kingship.This meant that the Martial King had several wives, and that he had many children besides Phante and Edora. In fact, long ago, Yeon-woo had even competed with one of the Martial King\u2019s other sons, Jang.Although Yeon-woo had known the Martial King for such a long time, he had never heard him talk about his other wives.There was only one person who the Martial King called his \u2018wife\u2019, the Psychic Medium. She was the only person he truly loved and trusted. Therefore, the Martial King unconditionally trusted the Psychic Medium\u2019s divination. He never had any distrust or doubts.\u201cBy the way. The divination did not state \u2018death\u2019, which simply means death, but \u2018elimination\u2019, which means disappearing forever. It means that I\u2019ll disappear without leaving even a speck of dust in this world. I won\u2019t even be able to reincarnate.\u201d The Martial King\u2019s eyes drooped. \u201cThat probably means I\u2019ll suffer something beyond death, total annihilation. My existence and soul will completely disappear. But ironically, you came here after turning your \u2018wheel\u2019, and I\u2019m still here like this.\u201dWhile the Martial King spoke, Yeon-woo remained silent. Seeing that, the Martial King seemed convinced about something. There was some connection between his existence and Yeon-woo. \u201cWhat have you done to me, disciple?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the One-horned tribe, red lines were said to have been used by matchmakers to connect the ankles of a man and a woman. A couple that was connected in this way would never split up, and they would stay together for eternity.Kronos unwittingly teared up when he saw it. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to untie the red string. His hands trembled. \u201c\u2026Wife.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t do it\u2026\u201d\u201cGoodness. You\u2019re so extra.\u201d Rhea chuckled at her husband. Her husband was so ferocious when he was the king of gods, and he was infamous for being cold-hearted among his subordinates. But he was so sensitive with anything relating to his children, so she couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Perhaps she loved him so much because of how much of a family man he was. Rhea comforted Kronos, \u201cLook, honey. It\u2019s not like our son is going anywhere. If anyone saw, they\u2019d think he\u2019s going somewhere far away. You can see him whenever you want.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026!\u00a0Hicc.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s lived well without us. So don\u2019t think of him as a child anymore. We should let him out of our arms so he can fly.\u201d\u201cI know. He\u2019s our son, so he\u2019ll do perfectly well on his own without me worrying about him\u2026 But still\u2026!\u201d\u201cGoodness! They say men cry more as they get older, and it looks like that really is the case for you. You\u2019re acting like this when our son is getting married, I can\u2019t even imagine how you\u2019ll act when our youngest\u2014\u201d\u201cNooooo!\u201d Kronos burst up.Rhea looked at Kronos with a dumbfounded face. She questioned if this really was the same man who was wiping his face with a handkerchief moments ago. His face was crumpled like a napkin. It was like the king of gods from the golden age had returned.\u201cI don\u2019t know who it\u2019ll be, but I\u2019m gonna kill them! I\u2019m gonna kill theeeeeem! No, no. Let\u2019s get rid of them before they meet our youngest. If we tell Yeon-woo and pull the wheel forward a bit, we can see what kind of punk it\u2019ll be!\u201d Kronos\u2019 eyes blazed as he declared, and Rhea shook her head from side to side. Then, she untied the red string and read the content of the letter. She compared it to the dates they had already chosen.Napgil was the process of the groom\u2019s side choosing an acceptable date and sending the bride\u2019s side a reply.Rhea ignored Kronos, who was muttering to himself and planning the assassination of his youngest daughter\u2019s future husband. She carefully wrote a date on the letter and tied it up again with the red string. \u201cLaplace.\u201d\u300eYes, sir! I mean, yas queen!\u300fA shadow rose next to Rhea and Laplace appeared with a salute. He had come so fast it was hard to believe he had just been with the other Eight Gods of Disorder. Laplace knew very well who held the power in this household.\u201cI\u2019ll leave this to you.\u201d\u300eEven if my body is destroyed from the hard work just like a few moments ago, I will complete this task no matter what happens!\u300fLaplace blabbered on and moved to accept the letter, but Rhea suddenly took the letter back with a stiff face. She said, \u201cNo. Don\u2019t do that.\u201d\u300eH-Huh\u2026?\u300f\u201cNo matter what happens, do not get hurt under any circumstances. Even if it\u2019s important, there\u2019s nothing more important than your health and safety, Laplace.\u201d\u300eM-Madam\u2026!\u300fLaplace suddenly teared up. No one had ever scolded him so warmly in the eons of his life! His heart was beating fast\u2015although it wasn\u2019t easily visible because it was covered by a lot of muscle.\u201cUnderstood?\u201dRhea continued to speak solemnly as if she was going to wait to hear Laplace\u2019s answer until the end.\u300eU-Understood!\u300fLaplace stood straight and saluted again.Rhea grinned. \u201cYup. That\u2019s our good boy, Laplace.\u201d She pat Laplace\u2019s head. Her hand was so warm that Laplace felt like he was going to melt on the spot.\u300eI, Laplace! Will continue to be your faithful bunny forever for the rest of my life! No, for all of eternity!\u300f\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go that far. Just protect our family as you have so far.\u201d\u300eYes, ma\u2019am! Then I, Laplace, will go and carry out your command! Forward! Swish!\u300fLaplace made exaggerated movements again and left.Rhea continued to wave until Laplace went out the door. Then, she realized her husband was looking at her with a face of respect and tilted her head. \u201cYes?\u201d\u201cMy wife\u2026is so incredible. How do you have him wrapped around your finger like that? What\u2019s the secret?\u201d\u201cSecret, my foot. He just acts a little different from other people. He\u2019s very nice on the inside.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe acted a\u00a0little\u00a0differently? Who?\u00a0Laplace? The bald punk who wore bunny ears on his head? Really? Kronos wondered if the meaning of the word \u201clittle\u201d had changed. But when he saw Rhea\u2019s eyes were still pure, he nodded hesitantly. He realized Rhea wasn\u2019t joking, and she had been genuine. Perhaps she was able to control such a monstrous guy because of how nice she was\u2026 Kronos thought about how great Rhea was again.* * *Fourth, napjing. Fifth, cheonggi.Napgil was when the groom\u2019s side informed the bride\u2019s side of when the marriage would be, and napjing was the exchange of gifts between the families now that the wedding date was confirmed. Cheonggi was the process of once again reviewing the permission to marry and the wedding date now that the families were closer. However, as all three were similar, the One-horned tribe did them all together.While Kronos and the Martial King exchanged greetings again and again, the festival continued. Because each of the six steps of the wedding ceremony was being commenced, it took a while. It was even said the wedding ceremonies of the royal tribe members took over a month, so there was no set end date for when the festival was going to be finished.The guests who initially said they weren\u2019t going to be able to visit the village managed to clear up their schedules to come at some point. And since the village was open, those who had been curious about the One-horned tribe but hadn\u2019t received invitations had come to the village as well. As a result, the palace of the Martial King and the annex where Kronos was staying bustled with people.The return of the legendary Kronos and Rhea had spread in the Tower, and this was also where Yeon-woo, the ruler of the Tower, was staying. The main gods of Olympus also stayed near the annex as Yeon-woo\u2019s family, and the members of Arthia were given rooms along the outer territory as Yeon-woo\u2019s \u201cclose friends.\u201dKronos was so busy greeting the gods of Olympus that he didn\u2019t have the time to greet any of the other guests. Those who came in hopes of seeing Kronos and Yeon-woo from afar had to leave the annex without any success.However, there were still beings who came to see the annex, and one of them was Leo, the lion constellation.\u201cThere\u2019s not much to it.\u201dLeo had a unique appearance with his lion\u2019s mane-like hair, but there wasn\u2019t anything special about him. He just looked like a well-built player from the rookie floors. This was a result of one of his traits as the lion constellation, Stealth, having been activated. He was like a waiting lion before the hunt. A lion\u2019s giant body didn\u2019t make any sound before it went in for the killing blow.Stealth was the trait that made Leo into an outstanding predator, and the same went for the subordinates who stood by his side. Lions moved in prides, and the female lionesses under the lion were all outstanding hunters. They were all able to arrive at the village hiding their abilities.Leo knew Yeon-woo had started targeting the stars, but he\u2019d come under his nose without any fear. And after Leo observed Yeon-woo and the people around him, he came to a conclusion. Yeon-woo wasn\u2019t anything to be scared of.The subordinates Leo brought, Denebola and Algieba, nodded in agreement. They had seen many beings so far. The gods of Olympus, the members of Arthia, Metatron and Baal\u2026but none of them stood out to Leo. Maybe Athena would be hard to handle for Denebola and Algieba, but definitely not for Leo. Or maybe the Eight Gods of Disorder from Night\u2026but most likely not.\u2018I was looking forward to them because of their great legends. But none of them stood out in particular.\u2019 If Leo had to choose someone who concerned him, he\u2019d choose the Resident of the Border. No, he could add one more being\u2014Kronos. Kronos was already as strong, if not stronger, than his prime. However, he still didn\u2019t make Leo feel threatened or wary.Because of this, Leo was able to realize how much stronger he was than he thought. He was also brimming with confidence at this point. \u2018The Black King might not be much since he just rules over these small fish.\u2019Of course, the Black King and the Heavenly Demon weren\u2019t beings to disregard. To settle things with them, Leo needed more time and power. However, he had come to the conclusion that he wouldn\u2019t need too much time.\u201cHmm, it seems a bit of a shame to return so early.\u201dLeo\u2019s original purpose, feeling out the enemy, was completed. But the mission had been finished so easily, and he wanted to do something more stimulating. If he went back to the Unreal World, all he could do was sleep for a while.Since he was already out, Leo wanted to do\u00a0something. Even better if he could see the face of the Black King\u2019s main ego. He also wanted to see what the resurrected first star looked like. He asked, \u201cHow many steps are left in the wedding process?\u201dDenebola responded with a bow at his question. \u201cI heard only the last step is left now.\u201d\u201cThe last step\u2026 That\u2019s where the ceremony will be, right?\u201d Leo lifted a corner of his mouth. \u201cI wonder how angry the new groom will look and how angry he\u2019ll be when the wedding\u2019s ruined. Huhu.\u201d\u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d\u201cYour wish is my command.\u201dDenebola and Algierba quietly disappeared without having to listen for any specific directions. Leo\u2019s smile deepened as he looked at the annex. \u201cI wonder, I wonder\u2026\u201d* * *\u201cYour Highness.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dFwip.\u00a0Edora paused from where she was turning the page of her book and lifted her head at the butler\u2019s summons. She currently had very deep dark circles under her eyes.The Psychic Medium told Edora she wasn\u2019t allowed to meet Yeon-woo before the ceremony, so she was trying to contain her frustrations and anger somehow. Yeon-woo was already skilled at making people wait, and she was annoyed that she couldn\u2019t see him when they were so close.\u201cA guest told me to deliver this to you, Your Highness.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cThey said you\u2019d know what it was after opening it\u2026.\u201d The butler held out a wide but thin box as he spoke. Edora tilted her head, wondering if someone was trying to bribe her. When she opened the box, she was taken aback. There was a prettily written letter inside.\u2015From the third president of ###\u2019s fanclub \u2018Temper Cult,\u2019 to the new bride.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019re coming back from where?\u300fThe long-haired man, J\u00f6rmungandr, wondered if he was hearing things right. He was already feeling quite uncomfortable having polymorphed into a human form, which he wasn't familiar with, but the words of his little sister, Hel, made him dumbfounded for a moment.\u300eBrother.\u300fUnaffected, Hel was sitting on a sofa with her feet on the table as she applied nail polish to her fingernails.\u300eWhat\u2026?\u300f\u300eAre your eardrums blocked?\u300f\u300e\u2026\u300f\u300eSo annoying. Why do you keep making me repeat myself?\u300fJ\u00f6rmungandr had a strong urge to smack the back of the head of this troublemaker. Hel was unaware of his feelings, busy examining her nails. Her index fingernail was sparkling more brilliantly than usual, most likely because she had used a polish that was made of finely grated rubies.\u300eI went to that princess palace or whatever it\u2019s called.\u300f\u300eExactly, why did you\u2026!\u300f\u300eDuh. I went to give her a letter.\u300fJ\u00f6rmungandr barely contained the curses that were about to pour out.\u300eYou don\u2019t know me? I\u2019m Hel. The third president of the Temper Cult. I should do at least this for my oraboni, who\u2019s going on a long trip.\u300fJ\u00f6rmungandr rubbed his throbbing temples. He should\u2019ve known from the moment Hel insisted on coming along. His foolish little sister had finally done it.This place was none other than the One-horned tribe\u2019s village. Monsters who considered the godly and demonic societies to be beneath them in terms of strength lived here. It wasn\u2019t an understatement to say this was the inside of a lion\u2019s den, no, a dragon\u2019s den.But his fool of a sister climbed over the walls and visited the princess\u2019 palace, the place where the very bride of this wedding was staying! It was true she had only pretended to be the princess\u2019 guest and given a letter to one of the guards, but roaming around without any permission was an act of looking down on the One-horned tribe.What would happen if the One-horned tribe decided to make an issue out of this? They were as famous for their stubbornness as they were for their strength. J\u00f6rmungandr felt dizzy from trying to figure out what he was going to do if the One-horned tribe called them out for this. But the troublemaker behind all this was composed as ever. What should he do about this?\u2018I\u2019m already feeling like I\u2019m going to lose my mind after my brother's disappearance. Argh\u2026!\u2019 J\u00f6rmungandr didn\u2019t know why his brother and little sister ended up in this state whenever Yeon-woo was involved. He didn\u2019t want to think of this any longer.\u2669\u266a\u266c~\u266a While he was deep in a pit of despair, Hel was busy humming to herself as she applied a new layer of nail polish.* * *Our oraboni, he\u2019s has a very beautiful temper.That was how the letter began.He stabs anyone he doesn\u2019t like in the back without any hesitation, and when he likes someone, he hits them in the front. You won\u2019t find anyone as unchanging as him.Edora had a hard time understanding if this letter was praising or criticizing Yeon-woo. The letter\u2019s tone seemed very respectful, but the content suggested otherwise.\u2018No. I think she is a fan.\u2019 Based on how well the writer knew Yeon-woo, it seemed to be a positive letter. However, Edora wasn\u2019t jealous or anything. Rather, she was grateful that there was someone who cared for Yeon-woo this much.Edora somewhat felt her frustrations from not being able to see Yeon-woo alleviate. At the same time, one part of her was concerned. She\u2019d heard about how celebrities received pictures with their eyes scratched out or cursing letters written in blood when it was rumored they were going out with someone\u2026 She wondered if this letter was going to be something like this. The first sentence didn\u2019t seem indicative of anything horrendous, but there could always be a twist.Still, Edora carefully treaded on. Fortunately, the sentence after that didn\u2019t have anything that she was worried about either.Since you\u2019re someone such an unchanging person has chosen, I\u2019m sure you must be an incredible person too.Actually, it was completely the opposite.He\u2019s someone who has always fought alone\u2026 I hope he no longer has to walk such a path. I hope you always stay by ###\u2019s side.The entire letter was filled with blessings for Yeon-woo and Edora\u2019s future. Hel was genuinely happy and relieved that Yeon-woo wasn\u2019t going to be lonely anymore. Edora could easily picture how Hel looked as she wrote this letter\u2015she had probably been smiling.I was very encouraged seeing him steadily walk forward on his own path. Through cheering him on, I was able to escape from the limits I placed on myself, and\u2026After that, Hel wrote about why she liked Yeon-woo, and how she came to cheer him on. She laughed with him, cried for him, and chatted with him\u2026 It seemed she had been living vicariously through Yeon-woo\u2019s travels.So I hope very much that you two are happy. Although I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t happen, on the veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeery off hand that it might happen, if he makes you cry unnie, come to Niflheim right away! I\u2019ll welcome you with both arms and fight against him on your side!Edora found herself smiling as she read the letter. She had never met Hel, but it felt like she\u2019d gained another ally.\u2018\u2026Wait. But why is she calling me unnie?\u2019 Remembering that Hel was a demon who was at least thousands of years old, Edora straightened her back and stiffened.P.S. Don\u2019t think too deeply about the minor details! Ohohohoho!\u201c\u2026\u201dAs if Hel had read Edora\u2019s mind, she had left a plausible postscript.\u00a0Psh.\u00a0Edora grinned. She carefully folded the letter and placed it back in the envelope. She probably would remember this letter for a long time.\u2018I\u2019m going to cherish it and keep it safe.\u2019 Edora stood up, her heart feeling warmed. But suddenly, a question occurred to her. Hel called herself the third president of the Temper Cult. Then\u2026 \u2018Who\u2019s the first and second\u2026?\u2019* * *Lastly, chinyeong.Finally, the day of the ceremony\u2019s last step arrived. On this day, the groom would head to the bride\u2019s house and greet her, and the wedding could commence. That meant\u2026today was the wedding day!Bustle, bustle. Clamor, clamor!\u00a0It was beyond noisy outside. Not only had the guests who were staying in the village come in front of the annex, but even those who were here to watch the wedding were gathered in front of the annex. There was an endless buzz thrumming from the people who were here to watch Yeon-woo bring his bride.However, Yeon-woo didn\u2019t hear any of it. From early in the morning, he had to get dressed in ceremonial clothing, brush his hair, apply light makeup, and brush his eyebrows. He was so out of it that he didn\u2019t even remember everything. \u201cWhew\u2026!\u201dAfter a busy morning, it was now almost time to leave, and Yeon-woo\u2019s heart was beating faster than ever.\u00a0Thump, thump. What if his heart actually jumped out of his chest at this rate? He already had cheongsimhwan and sleeping pills to calm down, but he didn\u2019t get a single wink of sleep last night. It was evident how nervous he was from his face.Just then, Rhea carefully approached with a smile. \u201cAre you that nervous?\u201d\u201cM\u2026other.\u201d Yeon-woo awkwardly turned his head toward Rhea. He opened his mouth to say something, but his voice wasn\u2019t leaving his throat.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so nervous. Everyone goes through it at least once.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cOhoho. You\u2019ll be fine. You know, on the morning of our wedding, your dad\u2014\u201d\u201cStooop! Wife! What are you saying?!\u201d Kronos frantically ran in and cut Rhea off.\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. I\u2019ll tell you next time.\u201dKronos waved his hand. \u201cNothing happened!\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to hear this embarrassing bit of history sometime.\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\u201cArrrghhh!\u201dYeon-woo cracked a faint smile seeing Kronos pull out his hair. Thankfully, he could feel his nervousness easing. His father and mother had probably come here for that very purpose. He was always grateful toward them.Whew\u2026!\u00a0After letting out another deep breath, Yeon-woo slowly stood up. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d* * *Buuuuu.\u00a0With the toot of a horn that was reminiscent of a boat\u2019s whistle, the process began.\u00a0Click, clack. Thum, thum, thum.\u00a0Yeon-woo left the annex for the palace with daechwita music, the sound of traditional winds and percussions, following him.The onlookers all moved forward.\u201cO-Ooooh!\u201d\u201cFinally!\u201d\u201cThe groom\u2019s walking!\u201dThe guests had only seen Laplace\u2019s procession before, so the appearance of the real groom was quite the spectacle. On top of that, Yeon-woo wearing the imposing traditional clothing of the One-horned tribe was a sacred sight to see. Nobody would think he was nervous based on his appearance.\u201cDang! He\u2019s definitely a looker.\u201d\u201cWell, Heaven Wing was always famous for his looks!\u201d\u201cHe did make a lot of female players cry\u2026\u201dA few players who lost their first loves to Heaven Wing recalled their painful past and cried tears of blood. Just then, someone brought up a question. \u201cHuh? Speaking of Heaven Wing, where is he?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right! I haven\u2019t seen him.\u201d\u201cHuh? Huuuh? Me neither! I haven\u2019t even seen anyone who resembles him.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t they twins? His parents, niece, and friends are all here, but does it make sense for his little brother not to be?\u201d\u201cDid\u2026something happen?\u201d\u201cYou idiot! He\u2019s the leader of Arthia and there are the gods of Olympus to help him. What could possibly happen?\u201d\u201cR-Right! Haha, hahaha!\u201dA conversation filled with anxiety was brought up, but it was soon buried under the cheering. And as the two strangers said, the twin brother who didn\u2019t attend his sibling\u2019s wedding was watching the ceremony from a book, high above the clouds.\u300e\u2026Something\u2019s a bit weird.\u300fAfter a moment of silence, the first person to speak was Shanon.\u300eA wedding? Neither me nor Hanryeong have heard anything about this! Neither did Boo\u2026!\u300fShanon also went on and on about that song about Yeon-woo\u2019s temper, but Yeon-woo wasn\u2019t someone to forget those closest to him. He would never have become the main ego of the Black King if he was.The issue was that Sesha, Kronos, and Rhea could see Yeon-woo\u2019s wedding, but the emperors, Cha Jeong-woo and Heavenly Demon, could not see it. It didn\u2019t make sense\u2026 Shanon and the others turned toward Jeong-woo and the Heavenly Demon.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dCha Jeong-woo and the Heavenly Demon pressed their lips tight without saying anything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Second Life RankerCH ss - 07Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySide Story Chapter 7 - Allforone (7)[This is the sixteenth floor, the gate of the \u2018Wheel of Life\u2019.]On the sixteenth floor, there were a total of three forks in the road. Though it was widely known that each fork in the road represented different characteristics, except for the numerous holy temples along the road and the large farms attached to them, there were no other particularly outstanding characteristics. Based on the floor\u2019s original premise, it was a place that presented a future pathway and fate for players challenging the stage.However, neither Vivasvat, the other troop members in Bifrost, nor the other warriors of Asgard ever received a fate or pathway from the floor.\u2018However, this moment is one that can change the fate of the people living here.\u2019 Vivasvat clenched his jaw. Though Garmr had her reserves, she continued the operation. Depending on what happened here, a huge disaster would befall those who lived on the sixteenth floor.\u300eThirteen minutes before midnight.\u300f \u00a0On a mountainside perched atop a sheer cliff, Urd smiled coldly as she looked down at the town spread out below her. Since her voice could travel, she opted to use a telepathic mode of communication.The village was built on one side of a large farm, which stretched out along the horizon. Since it was already well into the evening, all the lights in the village were turned off. There was only silence. The residents were probably fast asleep so that they could get up early tomorrow morning and go to work.Seeing this scene, it was hard for Vivasvat to believe that Olympus soldiers were secretly hiding within the village.\u300eAs soon as the hour marking the beginning of the great war is struck, we will launch our offensive. So\u2026get ready.\u300fClank!\u00a0As soon as Urd gave her order, the other two Valkyries, as well as the members of Bifrost, all drew their weapons and narrowed their eyes. Even if one did not approve of massacring civilians, orders were orders. As an elite foot soldier who abided by a tight military standard, one should show no hesitation to act.Among the gathered group was Vivasvat. Since he raised his magic power along with everyone else, no one doubted his intentions. However, his internal intentions were drastically different from what he projected outwards.\u201cBy the way, commander.\u201d\u201cUgh, what? Are you going to say something weird again?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. I apologize again for what happened a while ago. Those words came out impulsively\u2026 I\u2019ll be more careful next time.\u201d\u201cWhatever. What do you want to say?\u201d\u201cAre you going to leave things as they are?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re against this order, so you voiced your dissent to the Valkyries, right? Are you just planning on executing the order?\u201d\u201cAn order is an order. Why? Are you going to revolt?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Vivasvat recalled the conversation he had with Garmr earlier.When Vivasvat was not able to respond, Garmr silently looked upon him. Eventually, Garmr let out a sigh and asked, \u201c\u2026can I really trust you?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026?\u201d\u201cCan I really trust you? A guy who talks without thinking of the repercussions.\u201d The glint in Garmr\u2019s eyes was much different than at any other time Vivasvat could recall. It was not the lifeless eyes of a drunkard but infinitely cold and sharp.Vivasvat thought that those eyes were Garmr\u2019s \u2018original\u2019 eyes, the eyes she had when she was a Valkyrie. However, after realizing that there was a huge gap between ideal and reality, those eyes became lost. Vivasvat said, \u201cCommander.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhy would I ever forsake someone I like?\u201dVivasvat was beaten once more by Garmr, but in the end, he had gained Garmr\u2019s trust. As he expected, Garmr had prepared her own strategy. \u2018She said that she planned on rescuing the civilians. There\u2019s a high possibility that the Olympus people are separately detaining them or holding them hostage and threatening them. If we can save those who are detained before anything serious happens\u2026then the odds of success are quite high.\u2019If the Olympus forces were removed quickly, the overall damage that the large farm would receive could be reduced. Of course, the three Valkyries may order the massacre of the entire large farm, marking everyone within as rebels, but if the Olympus faction was quickly recognized and gotten rid of, Garmr said that she would have enough leverage to save the large farm.Thus, as soon as the operation started, Vivasvat was planning to quickly find the hostages\u2019 location. He thought it would not be too difficult. He had been put into this type of situation many times when he was planet hopping in the past.\u300eFive minutes remaining.\u300fAt that moment, hearing Urd\u2019s voice, Vivasvat snapped back to the present.\u300eThree minutes.\u300fHis hand tightened.\u300eOne minute.\u300fAt that moment, the other Valkyries and those of Bifrost were preparing to launch off the ground towards the village.\u300eMidnight! Shoot!\u300f \u00a0Urd waved her hand violently about her, and Verdandi and Skuld, who had been waiting, moved in unison. As soon as the two of them released their bowstrings, which were pointed downward at the village, arrows of light split into tens and hundreds of beams, all streaming down onto the village.\u2018I have to hurry!\u2019Whoosh!\u00a0Vivasvat quickly sprinted down the cliff and raised his senses to the limit. As the bombardment continued, the damage to the village increased.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhy is he in such a hurry?\u201d\u201cHey, what are you all doing? Hurry up and go!\u201d\u201cShit! I was going to wait and see what happened before rushing in\u2026!\u201dThe members of Bifrost, who were scheduled to move in only after the bombing was over, stood dazed and perplexed for a moment, but they soon followed after Vivasvat without much fuss.Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Rumble!\u00a0The bombardment continued without pause. It was a dangerous environment, as one could fall victim to the strikes and die without warning. Still, Vivasvat did not hesitate to enter the now burning village. However\u2026\u2018\u2026there\u2019s no one here?\u2019 Vivasvat felt a strange sensation even before setting foot in the village. Obviously, once people recognized that they were being bombarded, they would have run out of their homes. However, no one came out. According to Urd, this place was under the control of Olympus troops with all the villagers corralled together in one place.However, Vivasvat could not sense any lifeforms. It was as if he entered an abandoned ghost town. All he could see were magic circles installed everywhere that emitted magical fields to deceive one\u2019s senses. At that moment, a thought popped up in Vivasvat\u2019s mind. \u2018It\u2019s a trap!\u2019Vivasvat was about to shout at the Bifrost members behind him to stop their approach. But before he could do so, lightning bolts poured down nonstop from the dark clouds in the sky.[The divine punishment of Olympus is executed!]Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Rumble!\u00a0Thunderbolts of fire ripped through the sky and shook the earth as they hit the ground one after another.\u201cWhat the hell is this\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhy do those Valhalla bastards have such shotty intel!\u201dThe troop members unleashed their magic powers as much as they could all at once and hit the sides of the falling lightning bolts. Although they were annoyed at having fallen into a trap, they did not lose their cool. They had been in many different types of battlefields, and although things like this did not happen often, they had occasionally come across similar scenarios.\u201cWell, the Valkyries should find the magic core soon and\u2026 What the hell, why are they running this way?\u201dSince they had three Valkyrie, who Odin cherished, on their side, they expected that Olympus\u2019 attack would somehow be prevented\u2026 However, something strange was going on. Rather than trying to find the hidden Olympus camp of magic core, the three Valkyries were running towards the members of Bifrost with evil grins on their faces! Carrying a variety of different weapons, it was easy to tell that they were approaching the Bifrost members as enemies rather than friends.\u201cAre those bitches serious\u2026?\u201d\u201cSars! Devon! Avoid the incoming attacks!\u201dSars and Devan, who were closest to the three Valkyries, tried to react after hearing the urgent cries of their colleagues.Boom! Whoosh!\u00a0Urd, who was in the lead, wielded her spear relentlessly. Once her spear flashed past them, the two members burst into blood and dispersed. All that was left were pools of blood and bits of flesh on the ground.\u201cUrd!\u201d Garmr screamed and jumped forward in an instant. Vivasvat saw Garmr release an enormous amount of divine power, something he had not seen in the past year, as she fiercely wielded her ax-like sword and crashed against Urd\u2019s spear blade. The clash sent shockwaves everywhere.Rumble!\u00a0Garmr\u2019s ax-like sword and Urd\u2019s spear blade did not give up an inch after their initial contact. A tight battle began. However, unlike Garmr, who was visibly very angry, Urd had a smirk on her face.\u201cSo, how many times have I told you? Why not hurry up and take the seat you vacated? All this happened because you wasted your time and procrastinated on your true responsibilities.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d\u201cThat may have been possible in the past.\u201d Urd\u2019s smirk grew into a smile. \u201cBut now, your ability to wield divine power seems to have rusted, so I don\u2019t think you can do as you say, no?\u201dBoom! Boom! Boom!\u00a0While Garmr and Urd continued to clash fiercely\u2026\u2018What the hell is this\u2026!\u2019 Vivasvat was thrown into a chaotic situation. Olympus and Asgard joined hands because they wanted to eliminate Bifrost, but Vivasvat had no idea why they were doing this. Olympus had a grudge against Bifrost, so their intentions were apparent, but Asgard had no reason to attack Bifrost.\u2018Maybe it\u2019s because of me?\u2019 At that instant, an assumption flashed past Vivasvat\u2019s mind. Maybe his identity was discovered. It might be that his secret was found out, and all the things he had committed in the outside world had entered the ears of Valhalla. Then, it was understandable as to why Asgard was taking such drastic action.\u2018But even so\u2026 Why are they targeting the entire Bifrost troop\u2026!\u2019 Vivasvat did not have time to ponder. The other two Valkyries, Verdandi and Skuld, were rushing towards him.\u201cTarget, the son of the Heavenly Demon.\u201d\u201cI prophesied that your future is marked with \u2018death\u2019, and that death will be made final here!\u201d\u2018Is it because of father?\u2019Although the \u2018prophecy\u2019 uttered by Skuld troubled Vivasvat, he no longer deemed it necessary to hide his powers.\u201cYoungest! Hurry and avoid\u2026!\u201d The troop members stopped in their tracks as they looked dumbfoundedly at the gorgeous display of light that suddenly started revolving around Vivasvat.Whoosh!\u00a0A divine light. This was the first thought that passed through all the troop members\u2019 minds.Divine and virtuous\u2026 They could feel these qualities as well. That was why, at this moment, they stood in awe at Vivasvat\u2019s splendid and magnificent appearance. Even the veteran members who had seen countless gods while clashing against Asgard\u2019s enemies had never seen such a pure light distribution before. Thus, it was natural that the troop members felt that Vivasvat\u2019s appearance was the true descent of a god.And what happened afterward\u2026\u00a0Boom!\u00a0It was as if a real god was dishing out divine punishment! The moment Vivasvat spread his hands out and scattered his light roughly in the air, the light distribution flashed more brilliantly. Elongated halos of light covered the two Valkyries. And then\u2026\u201c\u2026huh?\u201d Skuld, who could no longer advance towards Vivasvat, made a stupid sounding comment without realizing it herself. She was running just a moment ago\u2026but her body was no longer moving.\u201cYou\u2019ve seen my future, but have you seen yours?\u201dIt was then that Skuld could see Vivasvat sneering at her. \u201cAh, ah! Aaaaah! My leg!\u201d She later realized that her upper body had been separated from her lower body when her field of vision started tilting backwards.Plop.\u00a0Skuld\u2019s upper body splattered on the ground while it profusely squirted out blood. Her scream rang out loudly. Even though she tried to restore her body using her powers, she strangely could not recuperate. The magic power left behind by Vivasvat was interfering with the movement and flow of her divine power.Bam!\u00a0Vivasvat did not stop there. He immediately ran towards Verdandi.Verdandi tried to put up a defense, as she saw how easily Skuld had been dealt with, but she could no longer track Vivasvat, who had seemingly disappeared.<Shukuchi><Great Handprint>\u201c\u2026where are you?\u201d\u201cI thought you could see the present\u2026 Do you see what\u2019s in store for you in the present?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d When Verdandi tried to turn her body towards the sound of Vivasvat\u2019s voice from behind her, she soon felt a light burst impact her back.Boom! Crack!\u201cUgh!\u201d Verdandi's spine snapped as she rolled helplessly on the ground. Covered in dust, she vomited blood. It did not seem that she could move her body.\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe members of the Bifrost who were watching the scene, and even the \u2018eyes of Olympus\u2019 hanging from the sky, were all in shock. There was no being who had taken care of a Valkyrie, let alone two, with such ease ever!\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell is going on.\u201d After linking a pillar of light, which extended from the earth to the sky, Vivasvat roared out. \u201cI want all you hiding bastards to come out.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Second Life RankerCH ss - 06Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySide Story Chapter 6 - Allforone (6)This was a\u00a0world where nothing existed. A man stepped into a place that anyone else would call an utter emptiness. A man with long, dazzling golden hair, woke up with a temper\u2014Zeus. The king of Olympus, the ruler of the \u2018sky\u2019, and the one who had dragged down the almighty Kronos from the throne.This was Zeus\u2019 illusory world. In other words, an illusory world that represented one of his holy territories. He could do whatever he wanted in this space, but he showed no signs of doing anything. Even though he possessed the divine domain of \u2018creation\u2019, he did not seem particularly interested in creating anything. It was as if he had just appeared here because he was waiting for something.[A new entity attempts to invade your space.][Odin is entering!]Rumble!\u00a0Just then, a thunderbolt fell in front of Zeus as if to threaten him. The aftershock was strong enough to cause him injury, but Zeus did not blink.Then, a being with a ferocious temperament and angered expression appeared. Contrary to Zeus\u2019 laid-back temperament, the newly arrived being exuded the odor of a battlefield. It seemed this unauthorized being was looking to destroy everything in front of him. The being was Odin, the main god of Asgard.If anyone else were to see this scene, they would have been terribly surprised. The heads of both societies who had just declared war against each other were now present in one place. However, although the two showed hostility towards each other, it did not seem like they would clash anytime soon.\u201cI thought you were just passing time by sleeping. It seems that you weren\u2019t just wasting time, huh?\u201d Zeus glanced at Odin up and down, and lightly smirked. Though he was still under the Heavenly Demon disease, he noticed that Odin\u2019s aura did not seem weaker than before Odin contracted the disease. No, on the contrary, Odin\u2019s divine power seemed to be stronger.\u201cWho said I was just passing time?\u201d\u201cSo, that wasn\u2019t the case?\u201d\u201cFor me, the war in my dreams is also a war.\u201dIn addition to his divine domain of \u2018storm/tempest\u2019, Odin possessed two other divine domains: war and twilight. Since he was born, Odin\u2019s life was filled with war. While progressing through the wars, Odin had reflected on the reason for life and the value of his existence. All the while, with his \u2018twilight\u2019 divine domain, he often felt that he was on the cusp of attaining a new ego.This was why Odin continued waging and participating in wars. It made no difference whether his eyes were open or closed. Even if he died, nothing would change. This was the approach that Odin had taken to face the coming great prophecy, the Twilight of the Gods (Ragnar\u00f6k).\u201cWell, if you say so.\u201d Zeus shrugged his shoulders and coldly stared at Odin. He knew that continuing to argue with Odin was like talking to a wall. Only Zeus' jaws would hurt. \u201cAnyway, the desired chessboard has been set, and the son of the Heavenly Demon has been placed as a chess piece atop the chessboard. Do you think it\u2019s really possible to attract the Heavenly Demon\u2019s attention with this?\u201d\u201cWe have to.\u201d\u201cOkay, so how exactly?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Odin bit his lip and did not say anything. It seemed he was unwilling to divulge anything more.Zeus did not pursue his line of questioning. He knew that Odin would never reply even if Zeus used force, unless Odin wanted to speak first.\u201cFine. Well, anyway, the fact that the son of the Heavenly Demon would enter the Tower and enter Asgard are all things you have \u2018seen\u2019, so I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve \u2018seen\u2019 what will happen in the future.\u201dOdin\u2019s ability to see into the future was different from other transcendent beings that utilized the law of causality to peer into the future. He was able to glimpse into a cross section of the \u2018wheel\u2019. Furthermore, the vision would be corroborated, as details were overlaid and reviewed with those from the three goddesses of fate placed under his command.Wasn\u2019t the fact that the son of the Heavenly Demon entered Asgard and eventually fell into their hands proof that Odin had successfully looked into the future? It was not a coincidence that Odin opened his eyes at this very moment, even though the Heavenly Demon disease was still weighing heavily on him.\u201cAnyway, there\u2019s a lot at stake this time around\u2026 Let\u2019s make sure we reel that damn Heavenly Demon in this time.\u201dZeus laughed heartily at the thought of smashing the Heavenly Demon, the being who had imprisoned all of them in the Tower. Even if they failed in killing the Heavenly Demon, Zeus felt that they would deal a blow to the Heavenly Demon if he saw his son get hurt. Thus, how could Zeus not be in high spirits?\u2018According to how this war is progressing, other main gods will also start participating.\u2019On the surface, this great war was only between Olympus and Asgard, but many other main gods were also involved behind the scenes. It was a big event that would shake the world of the Tower. It was the first time that the heavenly world, which never seemed able to unite, would join hands.While Zeus was happily contemplating the unfolding developments\u2026\u201c\u2026\u201d Odin was expressionless, as if he had been drained of all emotion and had become a lifeless doll.***\u201cLet\u2019s skip the background information and get right to the main point.\u201d Urd did not introduce herself. Her choice of words made it obvious that any member of Asgard should know who she was. \u201cThe place we are going to attack is the sixteenth floor.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that part of our territory?\u201d Feeling that something was off, one of the crew members tilted his head and asked a question. They understood that the lower floors, from tenth floor and below, were Olympus\u2019 areas. Wasn\u2019t the eleventh through thirtieth floors all under Asgard\u2019s rule? In particular, the sixteenth floor was a place where many holy temples, belonging to Asgard gods, were located. It did not make much sense to \u2018attack\u2019 such a floor.\u201cWhen the news of the Great War came out, we received a tip that a large farm on the sixteenth floor would rebel and join up with Olympus. We expect that they\u2019ve already joined Olympus\u2019 side.\u201dThe \u2018large farm\u2019 referred to the land owned by the holy temple and the surrounding villages where the workers who served the holy temple resided. The term \u2018large farm\u2019 was a derogatory term to describe the place where people not only did chores for the gods of the temple but also gathered and offered their faith.And, of course, humans living on these large farms were not treated as proper humans. They were essentially slaves or livestock. That was all. To be put into such a place\u2026the troop members felt as if they could already smell the stench of thick blood piercing their noses.\u201cWe leave at midnight. We\u2019re going to make a surprise attack, so be prepared.\u201d Urd finished all she had to say and left with the other two Valkyries.***Even after the three Valkyries left, none of the Bifrost members stood up from their seats.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201d\u201cDamn it.\u201d\u201cAre they planning on using us like dogs? Fuck.\u201dAll the members were busy venting their disappointment and swearing. Even though they may be dealing with revolting beings, they were going to have to deal with common, mortal people. Though it was called an attack, it was nothing more than a one-sided slaughter. For those who considered themselves warriors, it was a difficult operation to comprehend. However, the order had already been issued. It was impossible to go against the top-to-bottom chain of command within Asgard.At that moment, Vivasvat, who had been sitting silently, jumped up from his seat. The startled troop members around him quickly turned to him. The face of the youngest, who was usually quiet and blunt, was immensely cold.\u201cHey, you\u2026!\u201d Everyone tried to stop Vivasvat because they knew he would turn into a real madman when his eyes turned like this. However, before anyone could stop him, Vivasvat had already passed by the troop members.Garmr had left with the three Valkyrie sisters to see them off. Vivasvat was planning on catching up to them and speaking his mind. Just then\u2026\u201cHa! Are you three really going to act this way?\u201dFor some reason, it sounded like Garmr and the three Valkyrie sisters were arguing. Wondering what was going on, Vivasvat suddenly stopped his steps and hid in the shade of a tree.\u201cHmm. I don\u2019t know what you mean. Rather than that, do you think it is appropriate for a battle unit commander to speak freely with a Valhalla Valkyrie?\u201dUnlike the impression she left while speaking to Bifrost, Urd chuckled and egged Garmr on. Verdandi and Skuld looked as if they were enjoying the scene. It was as if they were originally acquaintances.\u201cIf you are going to use rank as an excuse, put it away. If it\u2019s a Valkyrie medal, I still have mine.\u201d\u201cOh! Did you feel belittled? Why are you so worked up? We\u2019re colleagues after all.\u201dWhile suppressing her anger, which reddened her face, Garmr spoke, \u201cThe members of Olympus that flowed into the sixteenth floor\u2026you guys knew they infiltrated the place but pretended not to know, right?\u201d\u201cHmm? I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re trying to use the crackdown on the large farm as an example before the start of the great war so that no one within Asgard\u2019s ranks dare think of getting out of line. It\u2019s an often-used technique that Valhalla utilizes to avoid getting stabbed in the back.\u201d\u201cHahaha. Because of your inability to reconcile the use of these tactics, you left your former glorious position and the many powers you were promised and decided to become a simple low-level commander, no?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dUrd smiled while holding her chin with her index finger and thumb. \u201cMy sweet and cute sister, Garmr. When will you mature? To be honest, the seat I\u2019m sitting in right now was yours, right? If you want, you can have it back right now.\u201dSlap!\u00a0Garmr swept away Urd\u2019s extended hand. \u201cI don\u2019t need that seat, so take it for yourself.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to take back what was once yours, then I guess there\u2019s nothing else that can be done.\u201d Urd shrugged her shoulders lightly. \u201cAnyway, whatever you choose to do is fine. If you\u2019re thinking of disobeying your superior\u2019s orders, please do not delay and tell us as soon as possible. Then I can finally stab my beloved sister\u2019s beautiful back, right? Hahaha.\u201dUrd let out such a shrill laugh and deliberately struck Garmr\u2019s shoulder with her own as she passed by. Verdandi and Skuld, who followed close behind, were also laughing out loud.Clasp!\u00a0Even after the three Valkyries had left, Garmr felt so indignant that she stood still in place for a long time.Vivasvat knew that there might be some secret between Garmr and the three Valkyries. He fell into thought. \u2018Should I comfort her?\u2019 Seeing Garmr calming her anger, Vivasvat felt that it might help her if he was beside her to comfort her, but then again, Garmr may become angry at the fact that he has observed a scene that Garmr would not want to show as the unit\u2019s commander. While he was still contemplating on what he should do\u2026\u201c\u2026Phew! You can come out now.\u201d Garmr sighed deeply and suddenly spoke in a blunt voice. Vivasvat trembled involuntarily before Garmr added, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to come out?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you want me to throw my ax-like sword in your direction?\u201d\u201c\u2026Did you know I was here the entire time?\u201d Vivasvat appeared with a sullen face.Garmr lightly snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re releasing killing intent so unabatedly, only an idiot wouldn\u2019t notice your presence.\u201d\u201cIs that\u2026so.\u201d Vivasvat scratched his cheek. Even though he was being talked down to, Vivasvat felt that the appearance of Garmr grumbling looked somewhat cute.\u2018\u2026wow, I must have truly lost my marbles.\u2019 To think that his commander, the Mad Dog of the battlefield, was cute\u2026 Vivasvat felt that his year in Asgard must have messed with his brain\u2019s inner circuitry. However, as Vivasvat looked at Garmr, he felt his own anger slowly subside. It was a strange feeling.\u201cPretend you didn\u2019t hear or see anything here. It\u2019s a secret that shouldn\u2019t be said to others. Then I\u2019ll forgive you.\u201d\u201cYes. Alright.\u201d\u201cI need to organize my thoughts, so you should leave.\u201d As if she did not have the energy to speak any more, Garmr lightly waved her hand and turned in the opposite direction.Vivasvat somehow got the feeling that Garmr\u2019s back seemed to slump and get smaller. Perhaps the questions and challenges that he was currently struggling with were the same things that had festered Garmr for a long time. Maybe that was why Vivasvat felt a sense of kinship with Garmr.Garmr was resentful at the fact that ordinary mortals would get hurt and protested against Valhalla\u2019s dirty tricks internally.Perhaps it was because of that that Vivasvat wanted to support Garmr. He wanted to give his support for her struggle, which she kept hidden away deep within herself. \u201cCommander.\u201d\u201c\u2026What else do you have to say?\u201dSo Vivasvat called out to Garmr, who looked back at him annoyingly.\u201cThe place where the commander's morals stem from will alight the path.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d\u201cAnd there\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026I will be with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d Garmr was momentarily stunned, but as soon as she understood the meaning of his words, her eyes grew wide. After leaving Valhalla, it was the first time anyone had read her thoughts so directly and sympathized with her. \u201cYou\u2026!\u201d\u201cSo, can I kiss you? I think I\u2019ve fallen in love with you.\u201dIn an instant, Garmr\u2019s face, which had been filled with an expression of annoyance, hardened.\u00a0Step. Step.\u00a0She approached Vivasvat quietly.\u00a0Bam!\u00a0She kicked Vivasvat\u2019s shin hard.\u201cThat\u2019s sexual harassment, you bastard!\u201d\u201cOuch!\u201d Vivasvat\u2019s screams rang out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He wondered if he could really trust the Heavenly Demon. Nocturne did not know if he could believe the Heavenly Demon\u2019s words.However, Nocturne could not help but follow along. Everything that the Heavenly Demon had stated shook Nocturne to the core. He did not know to what extent he should trust the Heavenly Demon\u2019s words. He was also unsure if the Heavenly Demon was deceiving himself and suppressing his pain of losing his son.In particular, the Heavenly Demon that appeared in the memories that Nocturne had \u2018lost\u2019 was always distrustful, so it was hard for Nocturne to fully trust the Heavenly Demon.The Heavenly Demon knew of Nocturne\u2019s wariness and thoughts. Seeing Nocturne just standing at the entrance of the portal without moving forward, the Heavenly Demon could not help but give a bitter smile.The Heavenly Demon was always a confident being. Even in the face of countless gods and demons, the Heavenly Demon never lost his composure. He had maintained his smile and pleasant temperament even when turning the \u2018wheel\u2019 during the entire duration of facing off against the Black King. Thus, it was uncharacteristic of him to make such an expression.Whoosh.\u00a0Then, Nocturne sensed a feeling welling up from his chest. Though his mind was operating in a logical fashion, it seemed his emotions still wanted to trust his own flesh and blood.\u201cDo you still\u2026hate me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWell. I understand. In your memory, I was nothing but a terrible father.\u201d The Heavenly Demon let out a long sigh as he scratched the back of his head. The current situation was difficult for him to wade through as well. If it was the Day or Night, they would have used force to make Nocturne submit, but the Heavenly Demon could not do that to Nocturne.\u201cBefore anything, I want to ask you something.\u201d Nocturne spoke slowly.The Heavenly Demon nodded his head to state that Nocturne should continue.\u201cIs what you said true?\u201d\u201cWhich part?\u201d\u201cThat I am \u2018real\u2019.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon smiled bitterly and nodded.Nocturne felt a heaviness in his chest. His voice quavered. \u201cThen\u2026what or who was Allforone?\u201d\u201cThat child was\u2026\u201d The Heavenly Demon took a deep breath before continuing his words. He spoke only after some time had passed. \u201cHe was also my son.\u201dThat answer was enough. It was a roundabout, general answer.\u201cTell me what happened.\u201dThanks to the Heavenly Demon unlocking his memories, Nocturne was able to recall some of his memories. Therefore, Nocturne was able to understand what happened to \u2018himself\u2019 and what had happened to Nocturne and Allforone.However, for some reason, to Nocturne, all those memories seemed distant, as if they belonged to a completely different person. It was as if he was a bystander watching a TV show or movie. Nocturne did not feel anything special or close to his memories. This was probably because his current identity was stronger than that of \u2018Son Jae-won\u2019 or \u2018Vivasvat\u2019. Although the time he had spent being \u2018Nocturne\u2019 was relatively short compared to the other two identities, Nocturne still felt that his identity as \u2018Nocturne\u2019 was more precious.Thus, Nocturne wanted to hear the story of his past directly from the Heavenly Demon. If he were to hear the entire story \u2018directly\u2019 from the Heavenly Demon, Nocturne felt that he would be able to tease the truth.As if he had read Nocturne\u2019s thoughts, the Heavenly Demon smiled bitterly and decided to grant his son\u2019s request. \u201cWhere should I start\u2026?\u201d Unlike his normal self, the Heavenly Demon\u2019s voice trailed off. He did not know where to start. The past encompassed stories related to \u2018Son Jae-won\u2019 and \u2018Vivasvat\u2019 as well as incidents related to himself. There was a lot to sort out.Then, suddenly, an incident popped into the Heavenly Demon\u2019s mind. It was the time when his \u2018son\u2019 ignored his warning and followed him into the Tower. The Heavenly Demon felt that this would be an appropriate starting point.The Heavenly Demon had to take a few deep breaths. It was painful for him to bring up the past, which he had been neglecting to speak of for a long time. However, at some point, he knew he had to retrace his steps, and it was something he had to do to resolve his relationship with his son. Hiding and running away from speaking of the past would no longer serve anyone, and it would not be good for his son. No, it would only hurt his \u2018son\u2019.In the end, as if he could no longer avoid the inevitable, the Heavenly Demon lowered himself in place. Then, he gently waved his hand in the air and pulled a vial out from his personal space. It was Hua Zhu, an alcoholic drink made from ripe fruits picked by monkeys from the crevice of rocks and then fermented. In the past, Hua Zhu was the drink of choice between the Heavenly Demon and Sun Wukong, the other face of himself and who also became his mentor.The Heavenly Demon only had a few Hua Zhus left now, but he thought it would be okay to share a drink with his \u2018son\u2019. No, in truth, he could not think of any better time to share the drink. \u201cWould you like a drink?\u201dNocturne wanted to ask if it was okay to drink something in such an airy, old-fashioned library, but he realized that his \u2018father\u2019 was serious in contrast to his laidback tone of voice. Nocturne nodded and sat down across from the Heavenly Demon. \u2018I\u2019m not the kind of person who cares about conventions anyway.\u2019Perhaps Nocturne\u2019s \u2018father\u2019 wanted to borrow the energy of alcohol to freely speak. Of course, there was no chance that the Heavenly Demon would get drunk, but the simple act of drinking would be enough to relieve some of his emotions.The Heavenly Demon quietly handed Nocturne a cup, and Nocturne took it carefully.\u00a0Plop. Plop.\u00a0With a pleasant sound, a sweet fruity scent spread out. And then\u2026\u201c\u2026back then\u2026\u201d The Heavenly Demon slowly began to speak. He was speaking of a time so long ago that it took him a moment to clearly recall everything that had happened.***Vivasvat was a name Son Jae-won started using from a certain point. It was a name that his mother used to call him in passing, like a pet name. If such a thing as a \u2018previous life\u2019 existed, she said that his father would have been called \u2018Vivasvat\u2019.Son Jae-won\u2019s mother played a lot of mischievous pranks, so Son Jae-won did not seriously consider his mother\u2019s words at the time. However, now, Son Jae-won knew that his mother was speaking the truth. His mother was just as mysterious a figure as his father. \u2018The first human to set foot in the underworld and the original existence of the god of death and the underworld. Yama.\u2019Son Jae-won, who had lived an ordinary life, realized that he was a special being, as he was born from a father who had all but created the universe and a mother who was a god of death and the underworld.Thus, since he was born with such a special bloodline, Son Jae-won was always confident that he could achieve whatever he wanted if he was willing to pursue it. He was probably an existence that all beings in the world looked up to, even gods. Even the highest-ranking supreme gods. However\u2026\u2018I will not become a god.\u2019 Son Jae-won, no, Vivasvat, drew a clear line in his growth and development. He vowed to never become a god.A god was something unacceptable for Vivasvat. This was because all the gods that Son Jae-won came across were all terrible beings. The gods treated mortals like livestock just because mortals were smaller and weaker than them. Mortals were often only kept around as slaves to be enjoyed in order to gather faith, the origin and source of their continued strength.Of course, there were also good gods, but roughly eight out of ten were terrible. Even if a god could be classified as a good god, that god would never resort to him or herself to get too close to mortals. No matter how good-hearted a person may be, he or she would not want to seriously understand the psychology of mere ants. Ants were useful for research purposes only. This was what gods thought of mortals. Therefore, Vivasvat did not attempt to transcend nor exuviate, even though he had already obtained the power to defeat most gods with ease.To achieve a legend meant to break free from one\u2019s limits and be reborn as a new being, a new \u2018me\u2019. In other words, a different \u2018me\u2019 was created instead of the \u2018me\u2019 that one currently perceived. However, could that new \u2018me\u2019 really be one\u2019s true identity? Vivasvat was certain that it was not. For him, a recreated self through achieving legends was simply deceiving oneself. The new re-creation would possess the name of Vivasvat and his memories, but a completely new identity would come into existence.Of course, even if Vivasvat did not actively seek out to achieve a legend, his achievements piled up, creating a new legend. \u2018That should be fine. The new power that originates from my achievements will come in handy.\u2019In the end, for Vivasvat, everything he achieved was nothing more than a \u2018tool\u2019 to kill gods and demons. Thus, he killed and dealt with the gods one by one. One day, gods and demons would disappear completely from the vast universe. Then, the nonsense that mocks and drives mortals into misery would no longer exist.\u201cIf you meet Buddha, kill Buddha; if you meet a monk, kill the monk. Thus, if I don\u2019t go to hell, whoever will?\u201d Vivasvat recalled the words he heard from a high priest who he had met one day in passing. He walked down this path, over and over again, silently and by himself.***Vivasvat traversed various worlds and universes to defeat gods, and at the same time, he tried to find the whereabouts of one person\u2014the Heavenly Demon. There was so much he wanted to hear from his father, who created this damn, forsaken universe.Vivasvat wanted to know why his father created such an absurd world. Thus, he wandered around the world chasing after the traces left by the Heavenly Demon, but none of the traces led him anywhere. However, Vivasvat became certain of one thing. \u2018My father\u2019s legends are slowly disappearing from people\u2019s minds.\u2019The legends of the Heavenly Demon had not completely disappeared. In every corner of the world, there were always a group or two who knew of and followed the Heavenly Demons. But in the various creation legends understood across the universe, the ratio of the Heavenly Demon\u2019s legends kept decreasing. In some places, the Heavenly Demon was called by other names and his feats were often minimized, and in some cases, the Heavenly Demon was described as an evil being that was associated with evil spirits and death.Such convoluted legends were usually fatal blows for ordinary gods, so there were many cases where gods would try to \u2018correct\u2019 these misunderstandings directly. However, the Heavenly Demon showed no sign of taking any similar action. It was as if the Heavenly Demon did not care at all. Although he seemed to be meticulously planning things, it seemed as though he did not bother with the little things.This was just like the father that Vivasvat knew. Whenever he had this thought, Vivasvat could not help but give a bitter laugh. At the same time, Vivasvat wondered if it was okay to let things progress as they were. If things continued down this path, the prestige and power of the Heavenly Demon would inevitably be destroyed.Regardless of what went on, the Heavenly Demon never showed up. No, the Heavenly Demon\u2019s inactions had led to a seemingly unfathomable result. His traces had largely disappeared from a certain point forward. It was almost impossible to see anything related to the Heavenly Demon. He had essentially disappeared, as if he had gone into hiding.\u2018Did he get in an argument and lose to someone? Is he being stuffed into a corner that he can\u2019t get out from?\u2019 Based on what Vivasvat recollected about his father, it was not a far-fetched idea that his father, who had a significant temper, would piss off the wrong people and be put in an unenviable situation.One day, Vivasvat opened a portal in search of a new civilization, hoping to somehow find traces of the Heavenly Demon.[An \u2018Invitation to the Tower\u2019 has arrived.]\u2018\u2026Tower?\u2019 Vivasvat received a message, one that would change his fate.inyourgalaxy's ThoughtsThe author's afterword is now up!

Any observer could easily tell that she was trying to calm her seething anger. \u201cThis was all for me, huh?\u201dPhante had laid out the various baskets of \u2018goods\u2019 in front of Edora. Each basket was large enough to hold Edora and then some, carrying piles of \u2018goods\u2019 within them. They were the materials for the dress she half-jokingly stated to her mother in private.\u2018Is this guy crazy\u2026? Who the hell takes that seriously?!\u2019All the things Phante brought back were, at one time, from terrifying existences. The thick branches of the divine cedar wood, the spinnerets of the Arachne, the pearls from the giant black clam located in the deep waters of the Sea of Death\u2026 Fine. This much could be understood as gathering materials. However, the triple-headed ogre\u2019s eyeballs\u2026or the desert worm\u2019s thorny slime\u2026 These were not things that anyone would consider appropriate to create a beautiful wedding dress!\u2018Well, if this guy had that much common sense, he wouldn\u2019t have acted like this in the first place\u2026 Ugh.\u2019Phante, who had no common sense to begin with, had no way of knowing that Edora had been joking with her mother. Having lived a life wherein he was always respected and adored by others, he had long ago lost any sense of basic logic.Rather, even now, Phante was expecting Edora to shower him with praise. He was seemingly stating that he had done everything for his dear sister and brother-in-law. He expected to be showered with praise and adoration! He wanted his greatness as a brother to be praised\u2026!\u201cYou fool.\u201d\u2018\u2026eh? Huh? No praise?\u2019\u201cIf you were going to bring something, you should have done it properly.\u201d Edora crossed her arms and spoke in a sullen tone. As Phante\u2019s gaze trembled wildly, she continued, \u201cDivine cedar wood twigs\u2026 You successfully attained them, but why are they all broken? You didn\u2019t preserve them well\u2026 Look, all the bark has been skinned off. Since the twigs are defective, both the appearance and the divine power that once resided in the twigs are all gone, and it\u2019s impossible to turn it into a laurel wreath.\u201d\u201cArgh\u2026!\u201d\u201cAnd these spinnerets\u2026. Ugh\u2026! You didn't seriously think that this raw material could easily be converted for weaving material, right? Are you dumb?\u201dIt was true that Arachne\u2019s thread was classified as a high-quality material. However, since the position of the spinneret on the Arachne was where it was, a timely and professional process was necessary to properly separate the spinneret to convert into thread. Otherwise\u2026the spinnerets, and the threads within them, would become useless as they were all stewing in secretion. Moreover, there was a poisonous gland in Arachne\u2019s body, so the thread would often melt within the spinneret before one could extract it out. These were the type of spinnerets Phante had brought. Even if the poison did not melt the thread first, the stench of secretion on any potential thread would put off any desire for one to use it as dress material.\u201cOh, no\u2026!\u201d After hearing Edora\u2019s explanation, Phante\u2019s complexion started to turn white. The reality of the situation was dawning on him.\u201cAnd these feathers\u2026 Ugh! Where do I start? You brought the entire bird? Did you think you could just bring the whole thing? Moreover, you\u2019ve handled it so roughly that only the bird\u2019s leather is intact, all the feathers have already fallen off. There\u2019s no use for this carcass you asshole!\u201d Edora\u2019s fact bombing continued without a break. \u201cThe pearls are scratched all over\u2026 What the hell were you thinking?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dPlop!\u00a0Phante slumped onto the ground in frustration. All the while, Edora constantly poured out insult after insult such as \u2018idiot\u2019, \u2018dumb\u2019, \u2018muscle head\u2019\u2026 There was no appreciation or praise for the suffering and effort he had gone through and endured. His daydream of gaining respect from Edora and Yeon-woo respectfully calling him brother-in-law\u2026 All of it became a mirage.\u201cAnd above all else.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d Wondering what else was there, Phante raised his head in a daze. He saw Edora stare back at him with her chin raised high.\u201cYou\u2019ve been causing trouble everywhere you\u2019ve gone\u2026 Do you think my wedding can be properly blessed? I\u2019d be thankful if I wasn\u2019t hexed with a bunch of curses!\u201dA wedding was a once-in-a-lifetime event, so it was more important than most other things in one\u2019s life. To make a hundred-year covenant with the one you love while receiving blessings and congratulations from everyone\u2026 That was the ideal that any bride would want before a marriage\u2026 However, Phante had overturned everything. Edora\u2019s anger flared up once more at the thought that few people would be present at her wedding, so she seethed.Phante, trembling under the aura that was emanating from his sister, could not help but take a few steps backwards. However\u2026\u00a0Bam!\u00a0Before he could even take a few steps back, he bumped into something. Once he stopped, he turned around and saw Yeon-woo standing, hands behind his back, with an angered expression on his face. Yeon-woo\u2019s face was so contorted that Phante could not imagine the amount of inner anger Yeon-woo was holding back.Whoosh!\u00a0The overwhelming aura spreading out from Yeon-woo was making the situation even more scary for Phante.\u201cShall we have a talk?\u201dA little while ago, Yeon-woo had finalized the calculation of compensation for the places that suffered damage due to Phante\u2019s escapade. Although the exact amount had not been finalized with the other parties, Yeon-woo was able to come down with a rough estimate. And the result was\u2026 Even if Yeon-woo tore Phante to shreds and sold off all his organs and all Phante\u2019s possessions, the gathered amount would fall pitifully short.Phante\u2019s face turned even more pale as he recalled the trauma he experienced when he learned how to use Blood Lightning from the head elder long ago\u2026 \u201cLearned\u201d might be a misleading term. Perhaps a better term would be that he was subjected to Blood Lightning strikes until he could endure it and learn how to use the skill himself.Argh!\u00a0Phante\u2019s screams filled the village.***Argh\u2026\u201cHmm? Is that Phante? Looks like he\u2019s gone and done something again. No matter how old he gets, he\u2019s always causing trouble\u2026 When will he ever mature? Tsk.\u201dPhante\u2019s desperate screams could be heard clearly all the way to where Yeon-woo and the Martial King were. The Martial King only seemed a bit more mature outwardly, but on the inside, he was similar to Phante in every way. Thus, seeing the Martial King state such words, Yeon-woo could not help but frown.\u201cWhy are you looking at me with such respectful eyes, disciple?\u201d\u201c\u2026does this look like respect?\u201d\u201cThen worship?\u201d\u201cIt seems that master has not really changed.\u201d\u201cOf course. A person cannot change overnight. If someone does change that quickly, one should be skeptical. One doesn\u2019t know what that person is up to.\u201dChuckle.\u00a0The Martial King burst out laughing in the meeting room, and Yeon-woo shook his head. There was no way to overcome his master\u2019s audacity.\u201cMore than that.\u201dThen, with a bright smile, the Martial King changed the subject. In fact, the atmosphere in the meeting room had been quite heavy just a moment earlier. This was because Yeon-woo had answered the Martial King\u2019s question on how he was revived.\u300e\u2026\u300fThe Psychic Medium had stayed silent throughout Yeon-woo\u2019s explanation. She must have been in shock.On the other hand, the Martial King did not seem to care at all. No, in some respect, he seemed quite refreshed.\u201cOkay. Then afterwards? What are your plans now?\u201d\u201cSomehow, I have to bring my parents to this time period, so I\u2019m going to wander around outside for a while.\u201d\u201cThat means\u2026you\u2019ll be disappearing again? Are you serious? You\u2019re going to leave my daughter all alone again? Are you going to make my daughter wait for you all her life?\u201d In an instant, the smile disappeared from the Martial King\u2019s face. \u201cEven if you\u2019re my disciple, I won\u2019t stay still.\u201dWhoosh!\u00a0A strong air current circulated throughout the meeting room. The killing intent was enough to make Yeon-woo\u2019s skin tingle. Behind the Martial King, something like an invisible shadow seemed to expose its ferocious teeth.\u2018It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen that.\u2019 Yeon-woo felt a strange feeling when he saw the shadow. It was the same feeling he felt when he first met the Martial King. This felt like meeting a ferocious beast.When Yeon-woo witnessed it, the Martial King had laughed at meeting such a peculiar fellow.The Martial King probably accepted Yeon-woo as a disciple because he saw potential in Yeon-woo.\u2018If I can also fully resurrect master\u2026 If he can become a permanent existence\u2026 If there\u2019s even the slightest possibility of that\u2026 I\u2019ll do it.\u2019 This was the future that Yeon-woo envisioned. The image that Brahm and Athena had seen with their foresight, Yeon-woo wanted to make that image a reality. No, to be frank, he wanted to do more. The people who were lost, the people who he had to lose, the people who he missed, the people who passed by during his travels\u2026 All the people who made \u2018Cha Yeon-woo\u2019 who he was today\u2026 If he had assembled all the legends on the ninety-ninth floor and completed \u2018me\u2019\u2026From now on, it was necessary to put together the numerous pieces of law of causality that made \u2018me\u2019 and return to his original shape. Yeon-woo thought that this was the last act he had left to do. Perhaps he was at the stage of completing his transcendence, which was still ongoing\u2026 This was a \u2018transcendence\u2019 to be born in a completely new form, surpassing everything one was. It had to be completed. Having organized his thoughts\u2026Chuckle.\u00a0Yeon-woo burst out laughing.\u201cYou laugh?\u201d One of the Martial King\u2019s eyebrows twitched, as if he did not appreciate Yeon-woo\u2019s response. Since he did not know what Yeon-woo was thinking, the Martial King thought that Yeon-woo was laughing at him.\u201cYes. I laughed.\u201d However, Yeon-woo did not try to correct the Martial King\u2019s misunderstanding right away. Yeon-woo was having too much fun. Every second he spent with the Martial King was enjoyable.\u201cReally\u2026 Has living been too boring for you recently?\u201d\u201cIf you can do it, try.\u201d\u201cYou think I can\u2019t?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYou egged me on yesterday as well\u2026 Are you arguing with your master now that you\u2019ve gained a bit of strength?\u201d\u201cMaster.\u201d Yeon-woo cut off the Martial King\u2019s words and brought himself closer to the Martial King in a sign of provocation. A sneer hung over Yeon-woo\u2019s lips. Even though he called the Martial King master, his master was no longer someone who could challenge him. At least, this was what Yeon-woo\u2019s actions seem to be stating. \u201cSince when have you been so long winded with your words?\u201dCrackle!\u00a0Veins started popping up from the Martial King\u2019s forehead.\u201cThis bastard\u2026?!\u201dThe Martial King made his move.\u00a0Boom!\u00a0At that moment, the meeting room, no, the entire building itself including the meeting room, exploded.Ring! Ring! Ring!\u00a0As an alarm rang, commotion spread throughout the village in an instant.\u201cW-What is it this time?\u201d\u201cDid an enemy appear?\u201d\u201cWhat brainless opponent would dare to raid our village with a large event looming in the horizon\u2026 huh?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that, you idiot!\u201d\u201cThen\u2026?\u201d\u201cCain and the chieftain are butting heads!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cOh! That sounds like loads of fun!\u201d\u201cOh, I can\u2019t miss this. Where are they? Where!\u201dAll the members of the tribe rushed to the place where Yeon-woo and the Martial King were fighting. They had already been excited about the wedding preparations, so their enthusiasm shot through the moon when they heard about this unexpected but welcomed event. After all, the most entertaining sight in the world was to watch others butt heads and fight!\u201cBut who do you think will win? The chief is a little stronger, right?\u201d\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily the case? Cain is also very strong. I think it\u2019ll be close.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cReally!\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 Today, it\u2019ll finally be settled\u2026!\u201d\u201cWe might finally be able to see our chieftain\u2019s eyebrow turn black!\u201d\u201cWoohoo!\u201dThe fact that the chieftain of the tribe, who was always busy harassing the members of the tribe and who acted inhumane, would be put in his place\u2026 The members of the tribe became ecstatic. And just like their expectations of being able to watch a fight\u2026Boom! Boom! Boom! Rumble!\u00a0Yeon-woo and the Martial King fought fiercely at a vacant lot that was immediately created by the various tribe members.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He felt that Olympus would be able to chase after him and throw him into another crisis at any moment.However, Garmr, who escaped with Vivasvat, did not fret. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. They say that it\u2019s darkest underneath the lamp. They won\u2019t find us very easily here.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dVivasvat, who was puzzled by what Garmr said, soon figured out the exact meaning of her words. It was a place that even ordinary players would not expect anyone to be in. It was a place where waste was collected, often referred to as a \u2018garbage dump\u2019. It was an inter-floor world that existed in the stairway that connected the nineteenth to the twentieth floor.There were barriers in place to hide the stairway, and though the garbage dump was organized to some extent, it was still a very disorganized and cluttered place. Vivasvat wondered if people could really live in a place like this.\u201cWow! Sister!\u201d\u201cDid you bring some sweets? Where are the sweets?\u201dWhen Garmr appeared, little children who appeared to be about five or six years old, jumped out and surrounded her in a circle.The Bifrost members seemed to be familiar with this kind of scene, so they did not seem to mind or give any special attention to the matter. Some Bifrost members even ran around and started actively playing with the children, flipping the children in the air or giving them piggy-back rides. Even the reinforcement group that assisted Vivasvat and the others on the sixteenth floor observed everything as if it was natural.\u201cWho is that guy?\u201d\u201cIs he another older brother?\u201dThe children were extremely interested in Vivasvat. Their faces were full of curiosity rather than wariness.Vivasvat, who did not know how to deal with children, found this sudden attention awkward. Furthermore, he was currently covered in blood and dust, having dealt with various gods. Vivasvat felt it was impossible for him to play with the children in such a state. However\u2026\u201cHmm? Ah, that uncle has a bunch of toys for you guys. Why don\u2019t you guys ask him for some?\u201d\u201cC-Captain?\u201d After hearing his captain\u2019s words, Vivasvat whipped his head towards Garmr to try and understand what she meant. But instead of getting any answer, he could see Garmr smirking.The children started clinging onto Vivasvat while he tried to explain to them that he did not have any toys.\u00a0Sparkle!\u00a0The children\u2019s eyes grew wide and twinkled. They looked like baby birds awaiting food from their mother.\u201cUmm\u2026 Well\u2026!\u201d Startled, Vivasvat stuttered about.\u201cHave you come, Garmr?\u201d Suddenly, adult voices rang out. The voices were filled with a sense of thorough exhaustion. They wore plain, sparse clothing and carried rudimentary weaponry. Vivasvat wondered if they were capable of properly fighting with those types of weapons. Strangely, unlike their outward shabby appearance, their eyes were full of life. Considering that people who were \u201cowned\u201d by holy temples or farms looked healthy on the outside but possessed lifeless eyes, these people were the exact opposite. Vivasvat felt that he was seeing those whose eyes stemmed from a sense of \u2018freedom\u2019 and \u2018belief\u2019.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Falar.\u201d Garmr lightly waved her hand to greet the young man called Falar, who had a charming smile. Apparently, he was the leader of this village. Garmr then said, \u201cVivasvat, this is Falar. Falar, this is Vivasvat. You guys should introduce yourselves. You\u2019ll be colleagues who will work together in the future.\u201dIn an instant, Falar\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cThen this person\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah. He\u2019s the one I spoke of before.\u201d\u201cI see. Nice to meet you. My name is Falar.\u201dVivasvat grabbed and shook Falar\u2019s outstretched hand. \u2018Hmm\u2026?\u2019 Though it was just a handshake, Vivasvat felt a tingling sensation run down his spine. However, the fleeting feeling was brief, so Vivasvat questioned if he had even felt something off at all. When Vivasvat looked up, he saw Falar\u2019s bright smile and eyes full of energy.\u2018Were my senses off?\u2019 Feeling uneasy, Vivasvat silently nodded his head rather than brightly greeting Falar.\u201cWelcome to Allforone.\u201d Falar did not seem to notice Vivasvat\u2019s hesitation, as he continued to smile brightly.***Allforone was the name Resistance had given themselves. This was a group of people who were willing to sacrifice everything for freedom. They expressed this belief and said that their goal was to resist the oppression of the gods.\u201cAlthough we try to engage in resistance activities, in the end, when considering the influence of divine societies, we\u2019re just a flickering candlelight before the almighty wind. For that reason, Garmr and her comrades have been serving Asgard in order to obtain resources and information.\u201dThe members of Allforone started explaining how they had infiltrated several divine societies. Asgard\u2019s Bifrost was just one of many infiltrating groups. There were many more hidden members of Allforone in various divine societies, Falar explained, and thanks to their active cooperation, many mortals had been saved.\u201cHowever, it may be difficult for us to be active for a while. Because of this incident, Asgard and Olympus seem to have been put on edge.\u201dVivasvat had a feeling that Falar gaze was fixed on him, so he wondered how he was supposed to interpret that.\u201cSo, for the time being, we should refrain from conducting outside activities and largely wait until their search efforts calm down.\u201dVivasvat did not ignore the sense of wariness and distance that Falar gave off. However, Vivasvat did not show any outward reaction towards it. In any organization, there was bound to be a feeling of exclusion for any new incoming member, and in fact, the largest reason why Asgard and Olympus were so thoroughly conducting their search efforts was because of him.Nevertheless, Falar and Allforone did not reject Vivasvat\u2019s entrance into their organization because of his power and fame. In fact, when the villagers found out that Vivasvat was the \u2018god killer of the outside world\u2019, whom they had only heard of through rumors, the villagers had gathered to observe him from afar.Falar seemed to have been wary that Vivasvat may become the new center and leadership of the organization. Furthermore, Vivasvat had already heard about this possibility from Garmr.\u201cThus, I implore you to be as careful as possible.\u201dEven though Vivasvat told Falar that he would be careful, Vivasvat could not shrug away the oddly anxious and uncomfortable aura he felt from Falar.***It soon became clear that Vivasvat\u2019s feeling of anxiousness was a premonition.\u300eInsignificant insects were gathered and living in this place. Eliminate them all.\u300fAsgard and Olympus chased after them all the way to the nineteenth-floor stairwell. Though no one knew how their location was leaked, the village that had been shrouded in secrecy and had been quiet for the past ten years was finally exposed\u2026 Actually, to be precise, the two societies knew of the village\u2019s existence but had just allowed it to continue until the time was right.\u201cEveryone, run away!\u201d\u201cGet the kids out of here! Anyone who can fight, stop them!\u201d[A battle breaks out!]The village was devastated by a few lightning bolts, which were thrown by Odin. A hot thermal storm swept past the village one after another with tremendous destructive power. It seemed as though the stage would collapse at any moment.Even in such a crisis, Allforone\u2019s response was brilliant. They clearly showed how they had managed to organize an organization in the face of so many threats and became a focal point for mortals who dreamed of freedom. The members of Allforone divided into several groups and garnered the attention of the incoming Asgard and Olympus troops, thus allowing the children and elderly to escape and get to safety.Although significant damage was incurred on the village, fortunately, the retreat was successful. However\u2026\u300eKeep chasing after them. I don\u2019t care if you all have to die\u2026 I want you to bring me the Heavenly Demon\u2019s son.\u300fAsgard and Olympus\u2019 pursuit was just the beginning.***A month soon passed. Nearly forty percent of Allforone\u2019s forces suffered damage because of the various traps and offenses that Asgard and Olympus deployed.Vivasvat did what he could to save as many of them as possible, but he could not prevent their constant losses. For the first time, a sense of gloom started to cast over those within Allforone, which had up to then not lost its laughter despite the continuous chase.***Four months passed. Damage was steadily accumulating, and more than sixty percent of Allforone\u2019s forces were either dead or injured.The gloom that lingered inside Allforone continued to snowball and began to corrode the hearts of its members. They became tired and easily fatigued. Some had no more hope and attempted to escape at night. To re-establish discipline within Allforone, some of the deserters were caught and beaten back into submission, but once their hearts were shaken, they could not easily rejoin the group wholeheartedly.Occasionally, Olympus and Asgard sent messages encouraging Allforone to surrender. Whenever these messages came, the resolve of the members of Allforone shook.It was only thanks to the existence of Vivasvat and Bifrost that Allforone was able to endure this much. If it was not for Vivasvat and Bifrost, Allforone would have been eliminated long ago. Near the end, Allforone became a place that was mainly of the old and infirm.***By the time a year had passed, Allforone had become just a shadow of its previous self. Moreover, as rumors started to spread about the existence of the Heavenly Demon\u2019s son within the heavenly world, other divine societies also started joining the fray. Memphis, Dilmun, Vedas, Chan Sect\u2026Allforone was no longer being chased by a few societies but by virtually all the top societies and forces that existed within the Tower.Because of this, Allforone was pushed to the brink of collapse. However, this did not mean that Allforone was taking on damage without dishing out their own. Utilizing infiltrators they had in various societies to stir up rebellions, Allforone successfully raided several farms on each floor and rescued a large number of enslaved mortals.And, of course, in the center of such great feats was Vivasvat! For that reason, at some point, the name Vivasvat began to be identified with Allforone.\u201cIt is said that at the places where Vivasvat descends, Allforone appears, and the gods become frightened.\u201d\u201cThose who live in Allforone\u2019s care can live a free life, not as slaves. Our future lies there.\u201d\u201cWe must free ourselves from oppression. The world of the Tower is the world of beings who want and strive to ascend to a higher place. We never came here to be slaves.\u201dThe names Allforone and Vivasvat soon entered everyone\u2019s lexicon.\u201cDid you hear the news?\u201d\u201cAbout them recapturing the twentieth floor?\u201d\u201cYeah. I heard that Memphis was thoroughly routed. Because of that, those on the thirtieth floor and beyond are all in emergency mode right now.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026!

We\u2019re also \u2018players\u2019 who came into the Tower after receiving invitations, so why can\u2019t we also achieve what Allforone is achieving?\u201dThose who were locked up in farms as slaves began to have hope in their hearts. Even if their various divine societies still enslaved them, they started holding out hope that they would soon be freed by Allforone.In the end, people with a similar vision and willpower began to join Allforone. They began to regain the courage and motivation necessary to climb the Tower.[A legend related to \u2018Vivasvat\u2019 has been created.

The three parts of his soul, the body, energy, and consciousness, felt like they weren\u2019t synchronized. These three were the main components of martial arts, so if they weren't in harmony, it would take a toll on his soul\u2026 If only his consciousness grew, his body might not be able to follow, and he could fall into a coma. If his body and energy became too great, he could lose control of his consciousness and become insane.The Martial King\u2019s body was currently unsynchronized. The three parts of his soul weren\u2019t connected properly. The links from his body to his energy, his energy to his mind, and his mind to his body were blocked by something. Most of this disharmony was eliminated after he transcended, but he was still lacking in many ways. However, as the system message said, the rate of discrepancy had decreased greatly.\u2018If I\u2026can gather more\u2026\u2019 The Martial King muttered to himself and clenched his fists. \u2018I will become closer to being complete.\u2019There was a height of strength the Martial King dreamed of for a long time. It was known as the highest peak that even his ancestor, Shaohao Jintian, wasn\u2019t able to reach. This was a peak that any martial artist, anyone who dedicated his life to the arts\u2014anyone who\u00a0gave\u00a0his life to the arts\u2014wanted to reach: the peak of life and death.The Martial King didn\u2019t know what the boundary between life and death felt like. He could only assume it was complete and without any imperfection. But if he could find all the fragments and complete his soul, becoming the true \u201cfirst star,\u201d if he could become an emperor like the real Martial King that Yeon-woo knew\u2026he could learn what the boundary was like.No. Even if he couldn\u2019t step onto that peak himself, the Martial King could see its shape. It was his greed and long-time yearning. When he believed his future was bright, he guaranteed himself that he\u2019d reach this peak someday, but he\u2019d forgotten this passion after facing the giant wall of Allforone. Now, the passion blazed inside of him again. He wanted to live for a long long time\u2026\u2018I thought I was free from worldly desires.\u2019 The Martial King reflected on himself. \u2018This damned disciple of mine has set fire to my passion again.\u2019 He had awakened. It was the awakening of the man with the title of Martial King and the name Nayu. A man who wanted to rise again.Swish![The level of your existence becomes more prominent!]\u300eHoney, you\u2026?\u300fThe Psychic Medium was surprised after reading her husband\u2019s resolve.Yeon-woo smiled faintly. He was relieved.Determination, greed, and passion, these were the emotions that moved life. Since the Martial King was determined to live anew, the Tower would be shaken due to his actions.And Asgard? No matter how they tried to stop the Martial King, how would they be able to handle the man who desperately desired to become stronger? In the past, they were able to endanger the Martial King with a cheat trick, but there was no need to worry about the current Martial King, who had transcended and awakened. Most great divine beings wouldn\u2019t be able to defeat the Martial Kings.What of the gods and demons? The same went for them. Even if the heavenly world all worked together because they thought the Martial King might become the new Allforone, even if they tried to create another massive wall, the Martial King would eagerly try and overcome it. Then, he could continue to overcome the hurdles again and again to reach the one-hundredth floor that no one had reached. This was the future Yeon-woo saw\u2018I can open it back up without any concern now.\u2019 Yeon-woo finally decided to open up the door to the heavenly world and he looked up at the sky. He had locked the ninety-eighth floor because he thought the divine beings would become wild after Allforone\u2019s absence, and he didn\u2019t want the Martial King to be harmed due to it.However, now, he could unlock the door without any worries. Of course, most of the gods and demons would descend to the lower world, and the conflict between mortals and transcendents would become worse. This would result in great chaos.\u2018But that\u2019s what the world of the Tower was intended to be like.\u2019 Yeon-woo believed such chaos would only be positive in the long run. It was true that Allforone\u2019s ideals were valid too. The difference between the mortals and transcendents was too large, and such chaos could result in exploitation by the transcendents.However, that would only be the case if mortals couldn\u2019t grow. The world of the Tower was different. There were various trials throughout the floors, and mortals could improve their strength through them. With talent and effort, they could hope to someday become transcendent too.Yeon-woo planned on ensuring their hopes could be attained, and he also intended on having the transcendents continue to improve themselves as well with the threat that they could someday be overtaken by the mortals.There would be no quiet day with all the battles and fights, but what did that matter? This was the world of the Tower. The best was contested at each civilization and planet, and those who wanted to reach higher pinnacles were invited to this world. That was what the Tower was.[You have accessed the \u2018system settings and controls\u2019 with your authority as High Guardian.][What will you change?]\u2018Release the lock on the ninety-eighth floor.\u2019[Starting your command.][In progress\u2026]Clunk!\u00a0The tightly shut lock in the sky began to open.\u00a0Creak, creak.\u00a0The cogwheels were forced to spin, and the sleeping mechanisms awoke again.\u00a0Urrrrng.[All the locking mechanisms on the ninety-eight floor have been released!]The invisible barrier that shut the sky was freed. At the same time, the disconnected channels were all connected, and all kinds of messages were delivered at once.[The godly society <Olympus> is taken aback at the sudden system unlock!][The godly society <Chan Sect> expresses curiosity about your authority!][The godly society <Asgard> looks for a way to transport to the lower world!]\u2026[The demonic society <Jie Sect> is confused at the absence of the seventy-seventh floor!][The demonic society <Niflheim> is surprised by you!]\u2026[All gods and demons of death are flustered by the intense connection they feel to you!]\u2026[Metatron, the celestial scribe of <Malach>, adjusts his glasses and sends you a message.][Message: I did suspect it, but are you\u2026 Has the battle of the Heavenly Demon and the Black King ended in the future?][Baal, the leader of <L\u2019Infernal>, quietly puts down the strawberry cake he was eating and sends you a message.][Message: I see. I\u2019ll have much to talk to you about when I head down this time.]Baal and Metatron were unforgettable beings to Yeon-woo. They ruled over absolute good and absolute evil, but they were actually pulling the strings from behind so the order of the heavenly world could be kept. They were also Uranus\u2019 companions and had attempted to protect his universe for a long time, and they were the guardians who tried to save people even while the Tower was collapsing.Yeon-woo also had many things he wanted to speak to them about like Baal said.[You send a message to Metatron and Baal with your authority as High Guardian.][Message: Please come visit anytime. I will accommodate you both as my grandfather\u2019s friends.][Metatron flinches in surprise.][Baal hums while preparing cookie sets that you might enjoy.]* * *\u201cOpening the heavenly world means those who were stuck on the seventy-sixth floor can also ascend, right?\u201d The Martial King was ever the same. The moment the entrance to the ninety-eighth floor was opened, he saw what Yeon-woo\u2019s plans were.\u201cWasn\u2019t this what you wanted?\u201d\u201cIs the sky blue?\u201d The Martial King grinned widely with crossed arms. \u201cI did. Very desperately.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI am the king of martial arts. I didn\u2019t credit myself with this title. It\u2019s something everyone in the Tower calls me as a sign of respect.\u201d The Martial King\u2019s eyes blazed with life.Yeon-woo could see the \u201cbeast\u201d he saw within the Martial King the first time they met begin to move. It was the Martial King\u2019s other ego and mirror of himself.\u201cBut I still haven\u2019t reached the end of martial arts. I haven\u2019t dominated this Tower that\u2019s made of martial arts. I\u2019ve been stuck in this countryside because of a colossal wall. How can I be the king of martial arts when I\u2019m so pathetic?\u201d The sleeping beast began to wake very slowly. \u201cBut a new path has opened now. If I sit back and do nothing, I should just throw away that title and remain as an old neighborhood man, shouldn't I?\u201dThere was an old adage, peng cheng wan li. The legendary dapeng bird stayed in its nest and never left it, so it was difficult to imagine what it looked like. However, once the bird spread its wings wide, that wasn\u2019t the case at all. Its wings were so wide that human eyes could not capture them all, and they covered the entire sky like clouds. Each flap of its wings caused waves of three thousand li to soar up, and the bird was able to fly ninety thousand li forward.\u201cSo I will climb to dominate. I will reach a higher peak than my ancestor, Shaohao Jintian, and speak of how low the Tower is.\u201dThe Martial King\u2019s beast was this dapeng bird.\u201cBut before that, there\u2019s something I must do.\u201dHowever, the bird wished to take care of something before spreading its wings.\u201cI still haven\u2019t properly overcome the wall that\u2019s blocked me until now.\u201dThe chains that tied the bird\u2019s feet had disappeared. However, the bird was not accepting of that fact. It wanted to find the owner of the chains.\u201cI can take the path my disciple has paved for me. It will be comfortable and easy. But as your teacher, I don\u2019t wish to show such a pathetic side of myself.\u201dIf not, the bird could be chained again.\u201cYou want me to overcome a new obstacle when I still haven\u2019t overcome the old one? Bullshit. How is that possible? I haven\u2019t taken the first step, so it\u2019s impossible for me to take the second. I\u2019ll only fall.\u201dThe dapeng bird wanted to be free of everything before flapping its wings.\u201cSo\u2026\u201dThe bird would brush off everything that tied it down and fly so high no one could reach it.\u201cIt may be a burden for you, but won\u2019t you help your teacher to properly take the first step while you\u2019re already lending a hand?\u201dThe bird wanted to meet Allforone and have the final showdown.Yeon-woo realized what the Martial King meant, and he nodded in understanding. \u201cI will help you. He\u2019ll come over here soon with Sesha, so I will prepare a meeting then.\u201dNow, it was time to cleanse the Martial King of his last regrets.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What does that mean\u2026?\u300fThe Psychic Medium\u2019s eye was restricted to the Tower. Her eye originated from the blessing of the young Shaohao Jintian, and it was closely related to the system. Her near-omniscience didn\u2019t apply to the stars, who were located outside of the Tower.She had been wondering what needed to be done to complete her husband\u2019s soul, so she couldn\u2019t help but be curious about what the Martial King was suddenly talking about. Yeon-woo and Edora\u2019s wedding was coming up soon too. Yeon-woo was going to be a newlywed, so it didn\u2019t make sense he was leaving home\u2026! Then, Psychic Medium closed her mouth when she realized Yeon-woo\u2019s perception of time was very different from theirs.Emperors were freed from the limits of time and space, and they were the only unique versions of themselves anywhere. Yeon-woo might be here now, but the Black King could be looking elsewhere. The world they lived in was only a dream that Black King was dreaming of. It wasn\u2019t strange for him to be looking down on the world from a third-party perspective, or an omniscient viewpoint. And most likely\u2026\u2018He\u2019s already examining all the worldlines and their respective eras.\u2019The fact that Yeon-woo was only able to bring Tigris\u2019 fragment so far could only mean one thing.\u2018The stars must be hiding in a third zone that even the Black King couldn\u2019t sense.\u2019The Heavenly Demon and the Black King were omniscient, and there was a place they couldn\u2019t see? Did such a place really exist? The existence of multiple worldlines, parallel universes, and multiverses was already hard to fathom for the Psychic Medium. But she had no choice but to accept them since they were really happening. It almost meant Yeon-woo had to take action himself to find the hidden stars.\u2018Another adventure\u2026\u2019 The Psychic Medium bit her lower lip. Why couldn\u2019t this child rest in peace and happiness? He was probably already exhausted mentally, so she felt apologetic at the way he was stepping up for his teacher. However, she was also eternally grateful.\u300e\u2026\u300fThe Psychic Medium couldn\u2019t speak because she was choked up.None of them would know even if Yeon-woo\u2019s trip took a while. Since he wasn\u2019t restricted by time, he would likely return to a point when not much time had passed for the rest of them. Then, he would say it hadn\u2019t been too difficult. He would never express how hard it had been. That was just the kind of child he was.Yeon-woo smiled faintly, reading the Psychic Medium\u2019s gaze, and nodded. He would be absent for a while to search for the stars.\u201cWhen will you leave?\u201d\u201cWell, we should have the wedding first. And I have to watch you getting beat up by Allforone.\u201dPulse!\u00a0Veins popped on the Martial King\u2019s forehead. \u201cWho\u2019s getting beat up by who?\u201d\u201cIs your age already catching up to you? I didn\u2019t even say it that quietly, but you can\u2019t hear me?\u201d\u201cWhat, punk?\u201dThe Martial King frowned in dissatisfaction as he looked at the smiling Yeon-woo. In the past, even if Yeon-woo acted up, he was still somewhat obedient. But now, he was treating his teacher like some neighborhood dog. If he knew Yeon-woo was this much of an impudent bastard, he would\u2019ve taught him a lesson before he grew so strong. These were the sorrows of a teacher.\u201cAnyway, if you make my daughter cry again, I\u2019ll crush both your legs to bits. Understood?\u201dYeon-woo smiled at the Martial King\u2019s warning. \u201cObviously.\u201d* * *The Tower was a place where efficiency and practicality were most prioritized, so the customs of the One-horned tribe were similar to that. The traditional wedding ritual was shortened as much as possible, and most tribe members just invited their family and friends to a banquet. That was it. In some cases, ceremonies ended with just the couple drinking water from an alcohol glass.However, this was only something that applied to the tribe members. If the groom or bride in question was family to the king, the ceremony was vastly different. Moreover, Edora wasn\u2019t merely a princess. She was the daughter of the Psychic Medium and was considered to be the next Psychic Medium. Of course, her wedding would be conducted with all the bells and whistles.A traditional wedding in the One-horned tribe commenced in six stages.First, the napchae.In the tribe, a wedding symbolized the promise between the couple, but it also symbolized the union of two families. So to demonstrate the solidarity of the families, both families took action first. The napchae was the wedding presents and proposal sent from the groom\u2019s family to the bride\u2019s family.The proposal letter would have in detail the birth date and time of the groom so his luck and fate could divination.Then, the bride\u2019s house would compare the groom\u2019s divination with the bride\u2019s to see if they were compatible or not. If they were, they accepted the marriage.\u201cHuh? Shouldn\u2019t Jeong-woo be the one to do this stuff?\u201dThe problem was that there wasn\u2019t anyone to send the proposal letter in Yeon-woo\u2019s family. They couldn\u2019t exactly summon Olympus because their relationship with them was awkward and it had been a while since they had any contact.So Kronos suggested bringing Jeong-woo, but he was immediately smacked on the back by Rhea, who said, \u201cYou fool! You know how busy he is! He\u2019s probably busy enough learning the duties of a librarian\u2026 We\u2019ll have him come when everything is done.\u201d\u201cThen who\u2026?\u201d\u201cWe have someone.\u201d\u201cWho\u2026?! H-Honey! No! Not him!\u201d\u201cDear. Although that child, Laplace, is quite mischievous, he won\u2019t cause mischief with something like this.\u201d\u201cNo, he definitely will!\u201d\u300eHuhuhu! I, Laplace, am honored by your faith in me, Madam!\u300fKronos tore his hair out and continued to argue that it shouldn\u2019t be Laplace, but he couldn\u2019t change Rhea\u2019s mind. In the end, Laplace was the one to send the proposal letter.\u201cN-Nooo\u2026\u201dFortunately, Laplace was different from his usual self as he carried the chest containing the proposal letter out of the house. His trait of being a muscly skinhead didn\u2019t change, but the bunny ear headband disappeared, and he wore the traditional loose clothing of the One-horned tribe. Because he was tall and fit, he looked very reliable and imposing.\u300eHuhuhuhu! It\u2019s very very good to wear these clothes sometimes to have a change in mood! I feel like doing the bunny breakdance in these!\u300f\u2026If only Laplace could shut his mouth too.Kronos covered his face and sighed, then spoke with a solemn face. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do the bunny breakdance or whatever it\u2019s called.\u201d\u300eHuhuhu. Don\u2019t worry.\u300f\u201cDon\u2019t stray from the path on your way.\u201d\u300eHuhu. Of course!\u300f\u201cDon\u2019t suddenly rip your clothes off because you\u2019re excited. Don\u2019t do a random muscle show either.\u201d\u300eAw. Do you really think I\u2019d do that, Grandmaster?\u300f\u201cPolitely, and modestly. Don\u2019t act rambunctiously. Walk with slow but wide steps. Keep your words to a minimum, and look focused. Don\u2019t make facial expressions. And\u2026!\u201d\u300eHuhuhu! My goodness, Grandmaster. You sure do have a lot of unnecessary concern for someone who was the king of gods.\u300f\u201c\u2026You should know best why I\u2019m so worried.\u201d Kronos sighed even more deeply as Laplace brushed it off as a joke. \u201cHaaa\u2026! Anyway, look serious, solemn, and strict. Don\u2019t forget these three!\u201d\u300eYes, sir! Roger that!\u300fLaplace exaggeratedly saluted with a shout. It only made Kronos even more anxious. But what could he do? Rhea was looking at Laplace adorably. He added.\u300eThen Laplace will be on his way now! Swish!\u300f\u201cHey! Don\u2019t run!\u201d Kronos let out a shout as he watched Laplace run out with his hands held out to his sides like an airplane.Second is the munmyung, the requesting of horoscopes from the bride\u2019s family.\u201cThe husband\u2019s side of the procession is on his way!\u201dLaplace carried the chest containing the proposal letter and walked past the main path in the center of the building.\u201cIf you leave today~\u266a\u201d\u201cWhen will you return~\u2669\u266a\u266c\u201d\u201cWho will take you~\u2669\u201d\u201cAway from us~\u266c\u201d\u201cHm? Something\u2019s weird. Isn\u2019t this song usually sung at funerals?\u201d\u201cWho cares! What\u2019s good is good! Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cHeehee! You\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cOkay, then with more of a beat this time!\u201d\u201cThe one who left in the flower carriage~\u2669\u266a\u201d\u201cFell asleep while leaving~ ulsoo~\u266c\u201d\u201cUlsoo!\u201d\u201cUlsooo!\u201dThe tribe members were eager onlookers as they watched the procession of the groom\u2019s family. It was every day they got to see something like this. People gathered behind Laplace\u2019s procession and made a crowd of people.Soon, Laplace arrived at the palace where Edora and the Martial King resided. It was a palace that only the tribal kings stayed in after the One-horned tribe came over to the Tower.Actually, it wasn\u2019t really large enough to be called a palace. Estate would be more apt, but the decorations left by time on the building made it seem ancient and venerable, so it had a castle-like atmosphere.\u201cOlympus\u2015 the former king of gods\u2015 Kronos and Rhea\u2015 the youngest son between them\u2015 Cha Yeon-woo\u2015 the One-horned tribe\u2015 the Martial King, the leader\u2015 Nayu and the Psychic Medium\u2015 their daughter\u2015 the princess of the Cheongram family\u2015 Edora\u2015 please\u2015 give your response\u2015 to this marriage\u2015!\u201d Everyone\u2019s gaze was fixed on Laplace, who raised the chest high in front of the tightly shut palace and squared his shoulders as he shouted.The munmyung was an event where someone from the husband\u2019s side asked the bride\u2019s side about the bride\u2019s birth date. It was their response to the proposal letter.The bride\u2019s side would include a date in the response letter that was acceptable for the wedding ceremony and the nappa (the groom presenting the gifts) and the jeonan (the groom taking a pair of ducks to the bride\u2019s house and bowing across from each other).If the bride\u2019s side opened the door wide and gave the response letter, it meant they accepted the marriage, and if the door wasn\u2019t opened, it meant the groom\u2019s side should return because they had no intention of sending their daughter away.Of course, this was just to keep up with appearances. The talks were already complete between the families. However, opening the door right away was an act that sullied the name of the bride\u2019s side, so it was customary for the groom\u2019s side to wait in front of the door for at least half a day.Due to this, Laplace stood in front of the door for a long time. He was still acting gravely, contrary to Kronos\u2019 concerns. \u2018Haha! So many people are looking at me! I love receiving people\u2019s attentive looks! I wish this moment would last forever. Huhuhu!\u2019 Although on the inside, he wasn\u2019t calm at all. Anyhow, he looked fine on the outside.Creak!\u00a0And soon, the door to the palace opened wide.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It may feel awkward at first, but just think of it as your own home.\u201dAfter Kronos opened the front door, Rhea waved her inside. Min Chae-young paused in front of the front door\u2019s mantle. Her two eyes grew round. \u2018This\u2026is cramped?\u2019 Min Chae-young felt that the world\u2019s interpretation of small or cramped had changed greatly since she last ventured out into the world.Sesha\u2019s house was, actually, very large. The front lawn was vast, with green grass and various plants planted everywhere. The home itself was three-stories tall and looked as if it had come out from a drama. For Min Chae-young, who had lived in a cramped studio with her mother and stepfather, the size of the house and lot seemed unbelievable. The opening foyer itself was larger than the studio she had lived in previously.\u2018Well\u2026 They are such great people, so of course they must be rich. They\u2019re probably very well off.\u2019However, Min Chae-young soon understood the meaning of Rhea\u2019s words. Since Chae-young had not experienced the day of the beginning, she did not really understand what it meant, but she knew that Kronos and Rhea were figures who played a large part in it. Was it because they were so powerful and strong that they possessed such a relaxed and calm outlook on everything? Or did their relaxed and calming attitudes allow them to become powerful and strong?Though she did not know the details of the family, Min Chae-young could see that the family was very tight-knit, so she could not help but feel a bit envious. Her own parents had always been strapped for cash and lived very tense lives. And since her parents were always tired and high-strung, if anything got on their nerves, they would instantly explode and shout out in anger. Domestic violence was a given, and the house was always filled with empty bottles of alcohol.There must have been many reasons for Min Chae-young\u2019s mother to abandon her and leave. This did not mean that Min Chae-young forgave her mother, just that she understood the situation. If she was ever put in her mother\u2019s shoes, Chae-young did not know what she would have done. Her mother was always abused by her ever-drunk husband and probably felt stress from the thought of having to provide for her daughter, who would soon enter university. Her mother had chosen to escape from all this.Thus, Min Chae-young could not help but think, if her mother was a bit more relaxed and calmer, if she had a bit of spare money, would Min Chae-young herself then have lived a normal life? These thoughts swirled in Min Chae-young\u2019s mind as she stood in front of the open front door. She felt that she would be unable to return to the past if she stepped past the door\u2019s mantle. Was it okay for her to live a normal life? Was it truly fine for her to live a different life?At that moment\u2026\u201cMin Chae-young.\u201d\u300c\u2026?\u300dSesha, who had gone in before Chae-young, reached her hand out to Chae-young. \u201cYou\u2019re visiting a friend\u2019s house. Don\u2019t think too hard about it.\u201d\u300c\u2026!\u300dAs if she read Chae-young\u2019s mind, Sesha smiled brightly. Min Chae-young nodded.\u300cUhm\u2026 Thanks!\u300dFor the first time in a long while, a smile formed on Chae-young\u2019s lips.***\u201cYou\u2019re not hurt anywhere, right? You\u2019re okay, right?\u201d\u201cOf course, mother. Don\u2019t nag, my friend\u2019s here.\u201dAnanta ran over to Kronos\u2019 house after hearing the news of her daughter. She was caught off guard when she heard her daughter had fallen into danger. Ananta took the time to look over her daughter a few times, just to make sure her daughter was truly okay.Though she felt guilty about worrying her mother, Sesha also felt embarrassed at her mother\u2019s actions, which were being observed by her grandfather, grandmother, and friend.However, regardless of her daughter\u2019s position, Ananta thoroughly looked at every inch of her daughter\u2019s body before sighing in relief. And then, with sharpened eyes\u2026\u00a0Bam!\u00a0Ananta smashed her daughter\u2019s back.Flinch.\u00a0The sound of the back smash was so loud that Min Chae-young could not help but flinch.\u201cAck! Mom! That hurts!\u201d\u201cOf course it hurts, do you think I hit you so that it wouldn\u2019t hurt?\u201dBam! Bam!\u201cAck! Stop it!\u201dSesha tried to get away from her mother\u2019s hand, but her mother, who was a well-known high ranker in the Tower, was not planning on letting her daughter off easy.\u201cYou only pick the most dangerous things to do, don\u2019t you? If something ever happens, I told you to use a teleport scroll or call on me!\u201dOther than Nephilim\u2019s Fire, there were many other options that Sesha could have chosen. From an early age, Sesha had garnered a lot of unwanted attention, and if the truth of her being a dragon species ever got out, she would fall into more trouble. Thus, Sesha and the others around her had made many preparations.Even with Earth\u2019s system down, these other options were available for Sesha, but she had decided not to use any of them. This was what enraged Ananta.Sesha felt wronged as she also had a lot to say about this matter. Having had an argument with her mother a couple weeks ago, Sesha had not yet apologized to her mother. Her dumb pride had stopped her from apologizing to her mother, even though she knew that her mother would accept the apology without another word. This was why Sesha had hesitated in calling her mother and how she found herself trapped within the Darkness Sphere.\u201cChae-young!\u201d\u300cUh, hmm?\u300d\u201cRun!\u201dNot waiting for a reply, Sesha grabbed onto Chae-young\u2019s wrist and dragged her up to the second floor.\u201cThat girl!\u201d With an exasperated expression, Ananta stared at the scurrying figure of her daughter. Ananta then plopped lifelessly onto a sofa. She felt as though she had lived through a few decades within the last few hours.\u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on her. It wasn\u2019t like Sesha wanted anything to happen.\u201d Kronos, who had read into Sesha\u2019s thoughts, spoke calmly with a smile.Ananta nodded as she continued to sigh. \u201cWell, I was just frustrated out of my mind\u2026 I\u2019m sorry to have acted so shamefully in front of both of you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. What mother wouldn\u2019t feel frustrated?\u201d Kronos, who still felt guilty about what position he had put his offspring in, knew the frustration that Ananta was feeling. Then, Kronos\u2019 expression became serious. \u201cAnyway\u2026 I\u2019ll need to have a talk about those beings called \u2018Stars\u2019. Do you know anything about them?\u201dAnanta saw the god of king\u2019s serious expression for the first time in a while. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t have any clue. I\u2019ve seen gods and demons with divine positions related to stars and constellations before\u2026 But I\u2019ve never heard of beings who referred to themselves as Stars.\u201d Within gods and demons, there was the Chan Sect\u2019s Big Dipper and Little Dipper, Memphis\u2019 Taweret, and even Olympus\u2019 Krios. However, none of these existences had referred to themselves as a Star. Thus, Ananta logically concluded that these Stars were their own species\u2026but Ananta had no clue where they originated or how they came to be.\u201cDid they possess a soul?\u201dKronos ruled over time and death. Ananta was asking if Kronos could call upon their souls and investigate further, but Kronos responded to Ananta\u2019s question with a shake of his head.\u201cNo, and I found that odd as well.\u201d\u201cOdd\u2026 Meaning\u2026?\u201d\u201cI sliced them clean through with Scythe, an instrument that is essentially made of time. They should have met their deaths, but they possessed no souls.\u201d Kronos\u2019 eyes narrowed. \u201cIt was as if they had wafted off into the air. Or perhaps rejoined their true bodies. They possessed existences, achievements, and legends\u2026but they didn\u2019t possess a soul. I have no clue what this means. In the beginning, I thought I was being tricked somehow.\u201dAnanta could not understand Kronos\u2019 explanation. Were there existences that did not possess a soul? That would mean the beings were like Cha Jeong-woo\u2019s previous vestige state of being\u2026but how were they able to hold onto their legends?Like a material, one\u2019s legends reinforced one\u2019s soul. Thus, it was nearly impossible for a soulless existence to hold onto legends. Cha Jeong-woo, who had acquired power through various iterations of the \u2018wheel\u2019, was an exception to this rule. These existences did not seem to possess life or death. Kronos felt that these existences, who called themselves Stars, were irregulars, beings that existed outside of the normal universe.\u201cPerhaps the Star Fragment that makes up the Stars consists of a soul? That\u2019s the definition of a fragment anyway, right? They\u2019re not complete.\u201d Rhea cautiously stated her opinion.Hearing this, Kronos' eyes popped open. \u201cThey\u2019re incomplete, so the fragments devour the host\u2019s soul and move using their host\u2019s physical forms?\u201d\u201cYes. However, it seems they allow the host\u2019s soul to survive and think that it is moving of its own free will and accord.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a frightening thought. It sounds plausible as well.\u201d Kronos could not help but let out an exasperated chuckle. He had recalled that the Stars had acted as if they were existences that possessed free will. However, based on Rhea\u2019s assessment, they may just be Star Fragments that manifested in being-form to search and acquire other fragment pieces. The beings themselves might not even know that they were being controlled by the Star Fragments.\u201cThen that means that the girl named Min Chae-young\u2026!\u201d\u300eDon\u2019t you think it would be best to stop conducting your conversation through physical voice?\u300fA shadow shot up amongst them with its index finger on its lips. It was Laplace. Kronos quickly realized that he almost made a mistake, but he still glared at Laplace. Was this perverted rabbit always this quick thinking?\u300eOhoho! Why are you looking at me so lovingly?\u300f\u201cFor a moment, I thought too highly of you.\u201d Kronos decided to give up on formulating any conclusion about Laplace. The more he tried to understand Laplace, the bigger the headache he incurred.\u201cAnyway, we\u2019re lacking information. We don\u2019t know where they\u2019re from, and it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s just a few of them either. First off, we should call on Jeong-woo.\u201d Kronos then crossed his arms across his chest and sighed heavily. \u201cDaughter-in-law, are you able to get a hold of Jeong-woo?\u201dAnanta gave a bitter smile as she shook her head. \u201cIt seems like he\u2019s having a hard time with the rapidly expanding world lines. Even if I send him a message, it\u2019ll be a while before he responds.\u201d\u201cIt seems there might be a connection between the rapidly expanding world lines and these Star fellows. The more world lines there are, the greater the number of crazy mutations.\u201dThe universe was probably not the same as what they once remembered. This was what Kronos was saying. Moreover, this was something that Jeong-woo had told his family members multiple times before.To find the form known as \u2018Cha Yeon-woo\u2019, Jeong-woo had started the division of world lines. However, the more this went on, the greater the stress Jeong-woo felt in handling the rapidly growing world lines. By utilizing his divine domain of law of causality, Jeong-woo was able to somewhat control what was happening in the world lines, but it would not have been weird if something had slipped by his notice. Moreover, since there were more world lines, there was a greater chance of \u2018emperor\u2019 level figures appearing\u2026Regardless, one thing was for sure. As long as Min Chae-young was present, those figures known as Stars or whatever would continue coming. It seemed that the family may be thrown into a more complicated situation than what they faced within the Tower.\u201cFirst, why don\u2019t we conduct further investigation into the Stars and try and find the person Chae-young is trying to find? Perhaps the person she\u2019s trying to find is related to what\u2019s going on here.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do that. For a girl who hasn\u2019t opened her eyes in ten years to suddenly open her eyes\u2026 Something must be up.\u201dThe gathered had already heard about Min Chae-young\u2019s background from Sesha. They were all in agreement that something would come about if they granted Chae-young\u2019s wish.\u201cWhat was the name of the person she\u2019s looking for?\u201d\u201cSon Jae-won. Fourteen years ago, he attended the same school that Sesha is currently attending. She also mentioned that he was relatively quiet.\u201d\u201cDo we know anything about his parents or if he had any relatives or siblings? Do we know anything else about him?\u201d\u201cHe always arrived early to school\u2026 He wasn\u2019t very eye-catching, but he seemed to shine, at least in her eyes.\u201d\u201cI guess he was her first love?\u201d\u201cHusband, why are you interested in such things?\u201d Rhea lightly swiped at Kronos.\u201cI must be getting old. Whenever I hear of youngsters and their love stories, my insides become scratchy. Perhaps it\u2019s because it reminds me of our own youth?\u201d\u201cUgh, this old man.\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201dRhea narrowed her eyes, but it did not seem she was too bothered by what Kronos said. Kronos lightly chuckled.\u201cAnyway, Son Jae-won\u2026 Son Jae-won\u2026 Hmm!\u201d Kronos chuckled as he rubbed his chin.\u201cWhat? Does the name ring a bell?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201d Kronos scratched the back of his head. \u201cIt\u2019s because another \u2018Son\u2019 has come up. I\u2019m pretty sure this \u2018Son\u2019 has no relation to the other \u2018Son\u2019\u2026 Hmpf! It seems I\u2019m becoming worried over everything as I\u2019m getting older.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dNot understanding what Kronos was saying, Rhea and Ananta tilted their heads in confusion. Kronos waved his hands and chuckled as he spoke.\u201cThere\u2019s something like that\u2026 Something like that\u2026\u201dThere were many Korean people with the surname \u2018Son\u2019. Since this \u2018Son\u2019 was a student studying in Korea, the chances were high that he was Korean, but if that was not a restriction, there could be thousands of people with the surname \u2018Son\u2019 in the world. Though it seemed like a simple coincidence for Kronos\u2026 Kronos could not help but feel a bit worried about the connection.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s so cute to see you so anxious. How could I not laugh?\u201dYeon-woo let out a deep sigh. It was painstakingly clear his mother was definitely a part of the Cha family at times like this. \u2018She\u2019s having such a good time that I can\u2019t even say anything\u2026 Great.\u2019While Laplace was visiting the palace as an envoy representing the groom\u2019s family, Yeon-woo was restless. It was Laplace, of all people, who was acting as the envoy! The most disobedient troublemaker of all his subordinates. Yeon-woo had wanted to give the job to Shanon or Hanryeong, or even Boo or Rebecca. \u2018But Shanon is with Jeong-woo. He\u2019s probably busy right now.\u2019Yeon-woo knew the reason why they didn\u2019t call Jeong-woo here was because it was one of the busiest times for him.The Changgong Library was where the history of the entire world was recorded. Moreover, the universe had recently been expanding with parallel universes and multiverses, so the scale of the library was becoming larger by day. It was a result created by the universe slowly taking its place with the battle between the Heavenly Demon and Black King paused.Yeon-woo didn\u2019t want Jeong-woo to be bothered with other things. He planned on calling him over when the actual wedding ceremony took place, not during its preparation stages. Although if Jeong-woo knew, he would be upset that he was excluded\u2026 Anyhow, that was why Yeon-woo didn\u2019t call Jeong-woo, and he couldn\u2019t summon Shanon either since Shanon was helping Jeong-woo.\u2018Hanryeong is traveling with his son, and Rebecca is with Cernunnos.\u2019Hanryeong and Rebecca were both spending time with beings special to them.\u2018Boo is\u2026a man of few words.\u2019 Yeon-woo felt apologetic to Boo, but he questioned whether Boo could really act out the duties of an envoy with how silent he was. \u2018\u2026And it\u2019s not like I can ask the otherworld gods or Olympus either.\u2019The Resident of the Border and other otherworld gods didn\u2019t know the customs of this \u201cinside world,\u201d so it was likely they\u2019d just be standing around with blank expressions. Yeon-woo hadn\u2019t had any contact with Olympus in a while either, so it was awkward to ask them.On the other hand, Laplace wasn\u2019t busy doing anything in particular, and he knew of the Tower\u2019s customs and the current situation, so he was a perfect fit\u2026 And so for all these complicated and annoying reasons, Laplace ended up being the envoy in the end.Yeon-woo couldn\u2019t help but worry about the trouble Laplace might cause on the way, so he had kept open their channel of communication.\u300eI\u2019m so excited to be receiving all this attention and affection!\u300fBut Yeon-woo desperately wanted to shut it off. Fortunately, Laplace didn\u2019t make any scenes, probably because of Yeon-woo warning that he\u2019d keep him locked in the middle of emptiness for at least ten thousand years if he caused any mischief\u2026 Yeon-woo muttered to himself that Laplace better keep up what he was doing.\u201cSon, can I hug you?\u201d Yeon-woo nodded as Rhea asked with a smile. She gripped him tight. She held her son who was at least a head taller than her in her arms and stroked the back of his head proudly. \u201cToday will be the last day of you just being my son.\u201d\u201c\u2026Mother.\u201d\u201cIt was really hard for you all this time, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou always made sacrifices for our family\u2026 Both your dad and I are apologetic and grateful to you. Always.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNow, you can put down all the heavy burdens weighing down your shoulders.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, my son.\u201dYeon-woo couldn\u2019t say anything for a while. If he opened his mouth, the emotions he\u2019d managed to keep down would suddenly pour out.\u201cThank you for being born as my son.\u201dBut it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201c\u2026Thank you for being my mother.\u201d Yeon-woo was only able to speak a long moment later.Rhea kept her son in a tight embrace. She hoped with all her heart that her son could finally be free and live happily a life of his own.* * *[This is the \u2018One-horned Tribe\u2019s Village!\u2019][There is currently a big festival happening in the village. The One-horned tribe has made an announcement regarding this festival to all participants.][The announcement is all follows.][Announcement][1. Festivals are sacred.][2. Any act of disrupting this sacred festival will be seen as a challenge to the One-horned tribe.][3. You are forbidden from causing any incident while the festival is taking place.][4. The village takes a neutral stance on all things political, and personal grudges between outsiders while in the village won\u2019t be permitted.][5. Stay well behaved with the other minor rules. If you don\u2019t listen, just know you\u2019ll die.]Frankly, the announcement could be summed up by the fifth point. It was a violent threat that anyone who disrupted the festival or got on the tribe\u2019s bad side would end up dead.It was a blunt message that didn\u2019t take into consideration the reputation of clans who read it, so there were many who talked behind the tribe\u2019s back. But this was commonly how the One-horned tribe acted, so no one openly complained.As a result, despite the great number of clans, groups, players, and rankers in the tribe, nothing too eventful happened.To be honest, even if it wasn\u2019t the threat of the One-horned tribe, no one would do anything that would get the supreme god of Olympus, the king of gods and demons of death, ruler of the dragons of death and Ghost Giants, and the system's highest administrator mad.\u201cWhoa!\u201d Thanks to this, Sesha was able to enjoy the festival to her heart\u2019s content. \u201cThis is delicious!\u201dSesha took a big bite of a skewer she purchased from a street vendor and let out an exclamation of astonishment. A festival of flavor exploded in her mouth from the burst of meat and vegetables with special sauce and the taste of fire.\u201cThis is good too!\u201dShe was captured by dumplings filled with meat juice.\u201cAnd so is this!\u201dThe churros filled with chocolate were delicious as well.\u201cIs this\u2026heaven?!\u201dSesha had experienced many things in her life, so she didn\u2019t make any expression of emotions easily, but she was excited to return to her home, the Tower.Ananta followed her daughter with a smile and was surprised the Tower, a place constantly filled with wars, could give off such an atmosphere. On the way here, they had seen many people and processions, but there was no fight. Ananta saw the flags waving in the air and was taken aback by how many clans were in the Tower.On the other hand, Min Chae-young, who wasn\u2019t used to seeing crowds of people, was feeling very timid. This was her first time traveling to an \u201cotherworld,\u201d so everything was foreign. The group had found out later, but Min Chae-young had never flown in an airplane either. She had never left South Korea, so it was probably even more shocking to see this world.Still, Ananta was protecting Min Chae-young by her side, and Sesha dragged her along to see this and that, so her tensions eased. After a day or two, she\u2019d probably get used to it, wouldn\u2019t she?\u2018I hope she only sees the good things before she leaves.\u2019 Ananta knew of how gruesome the Tower could be, so she hoped Min Chae-young didn\u2019t have to know the pain in the Tower until the end.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u2018\u2026Fortunately, he\u2019s staying quiet too.\u2019 Ananta smiled wryly looking at the hooded man who stayed close behind Min Chae-young: Allforone. He was the man who had Vivasvat\u2019s identity and Son Jae-won\u2019s memories at the same time. Right now, most of his powers were sealed due to Yeon-woo, so he looked normal, without any light coming off of him. No one would think he was Allforone from how he looked now.Still, Ananta knew of his hostility toward the transcendents and resentment of the world, so she was concerned he might cause trouble. Fortunately, Allforone just looked around with emotionless eyes, not showing any reaction.Under normal circumstances, Allforone would\u2019ve tried to carry out his will even if Yeon-woo had sealed his abilities, but reuniting with Min Chae-young must have influenced him greatly, because he was still keeping quiet obediently.Ananta was curious about Allforone and Min Chae-young\u2019s relationship. \u2018Do they try and complete each other because they\u2019re both imperfect?\u2019 They were both missing something for a long time, so Ananta wondered if they were trying to fill each other\u2019s existences. There were many forms of love.\u2018Just like me and my husband.\u2019 Upon that thought, Ananta hoped their relationship turned out well, although they were both hanging on dangerously by threads.\u201cChae-young.\u201dFortunately, it didn\u2019t look like Ananta had to worry about Min Chae-young too much. She wasn\u2019t alone anymore. Chae-young looked around like a scared meerkat, but Sesha tightly gripped her hand.\u300cH-Hmm\u2026?\u300d\u201cI think they\u2019re putting on a performance there. Let\u2019s go see it.\u201d\u300cHm? I\u2026!\u300d\u201cCome on.\u201d Sesha pulled Chae-young along before she could say anything. She wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer. Min Chae-young stuttered and was dragged through the crowd of people.\u201cSesha! Look where you\u2019re going!\u201d Ananta and Allforone followed behind them. Ananta knew nothing could stop her daughter when she was acting this way, so she was anxious that something might happen.Soon enough, the running Sesha slightly bumped into an elderly man\u2019s shoulder. He had gray hair and was wearing a blindfold. He had a distinct appearance with the large crow on one of his shoulders.\u201cOh! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Sesha quickly bowed. Although it was only a soft bump, it was only right she apologized since it was her mistake, and the man might be mad.\u201c\u2026\u201d However, the one-eyed man just glanced at his shoulder and didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cGoodness! I told you not to run\u2026! I\u2019ll apologize instead. Are you all right?\u201d Ananta arrived a moment later and bowed. The atmosphere was tense.\u201c\u2026\u201d However, the man just looked between Sesha and Ananta with his one eye. He stayed silent for so long that they wondered if he was unable to speak.Caaw! Caaaaw!\u00a0Just then, the crow flapped its wings and let out a queer cry. It was such a loud noise that the people walking by quickly distanced themselves from the old man and glanced at him.Ananta strangely received an ominous feeling. Something she couldn\u2019t explain in words, the aura of death\u2014something that would be felt from a battlefield\u2014was being exuded from the man. \u201cIf you\u2019re hurt anywhere, please let me\u2026!\u201d She was about to say something, but the man suddenly stretched a hand toward her. It was such a natural movement that Ananta didn\u2019t realize something was wrong. She didn\u2019t feel any murderous intent or emotion from him.\u201cMom!\u201dAnanta only realized the ominous energy wrapped around the old man\u2019s after Sesha called for her. \u2018A skill of high level\u2026!\u2019 She frantically tried to summon her magic power but the old man\u2019s hand was already inches from her face. The fact that she might die took over her head, but another arm suddenly stretched out and annoyingly snatched the old man\u2019s hand away.Ananta turned toward the direction the hand came from, and she saw a familiar face. The new leader of Olympus, Athena, glowered at the old man with a stiff face. \u201cDid you already forget trouble won\u2019t be permitted at this place, Odin?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was a friend who lived her entire life while being used and hurt by others. Vivasvat, who was usually indifferent to worldly affairs, felt a swell of emotion when he recalled his past friend\u2019s image. It had been a traumatic event for him.\u201cIf you don\u2019t let go\u2026\u201d Vivasvat\u2019s eyes shone with a ferocity. \u201c\u2026you\u2019ll die.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d Garmr could not help but flinch. She became startled at the sudden overwhelming pressure that Vivasvat exuded. Although Vivasvat was not directing any of his ferocity towards her, a sense of dread steeped within her, a chill running down her entire spine. Her drunken stupor immediately evaporated.At that moment, Garmr understood that Vivasvat had been hiding his powers. Though she did not know what type of life he had led outside the Tower, she knew that it could not have been an easy one.However, Garmr had also lived a tumultuous life filled with bloodshed and difficulties. Although surprised by the momentary overwhelming pressure, Garmr spoke to Vivasvat in a cold tone without any hesitation. \u201cFine. Let\u2019s say I let you go, and you help her, like you said. What will happen afterwards? All the troops stationed on this floor will be after you, no?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll wipe them away.\u201d\u201cThen what about after that? Wouldn\u2019t the prideful Asgard come after you? Are you going to wipe them all away as well?\u201d\u201cIf I must\u2026!\u201d\u201cThen what about after that? You\u2019re planning on dealing with the other gods on every floor? And then? Face against the demons? The dragons as well? Why? Are you saying that you are going to deal with all societies?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Vivasvat wasn\u2019t an idiot. He understood Garmr\u2019s explanation, so he could only stay quiet. Garmr was stating that things would only go downhill for Vivasvat if he acted as he pleased.\u201cAre you planning on taking responsibility for everything? That kid and everyone else associated with her will get hurt beyond what you can currently comprehend because of you\u2026 Can you handle that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWith power comes responsibilities. Don\u2019t make foolish moves just because something does not please you. Even if you have good intentions, you may put others at greater risk.\u201dVivasvat\u2019s anger slowly dissipated. However, his tightly sealed lips remained.\u201cThe situation sucks. He\u2019s doing whatever he wants because he\u2019s relying on his background. I want to gather the bastards who rely on their bloodline to treat mortals as livestock and shred them into pieces as well. Not just me, but a lot of other people feel that way, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut do you know why I\u2019m not acting out? It\u2019s because I don\u2019t have the strength. Because I can\u2019t afford to take responsibility for my actions. If I do what I please, I know what those people will experience afterwards.\u201d Garmr narrowed her eyes. \u201cSo, what are you going to do? Are you still going to act?\u201dA long silence ensued. Vivasvat eventually retreated. He glared at Garmr with eyes full of dissatisfaction. Vivasvat realized that Garmr had her own code and goal. She was not just another drunkard, so he wondered what she was really after.***Bifrost was literally translated to mean a \u2018three-colored rainbow bridge\u2019.\u201cCheers to our new member, Vivasvat!\u201d\u201cCheers!\u201dIt was truly a shitshow. It seemed that the members of the unit were all alcoholics, much like their leading commander. Vivasvat wondered how they could all be so similar, and whether they were all inflicted with a disease that would kill them unless they consumed alcohol. Vivasvat\u2019s entrance celebration was just an excuse to drink. Even before Vivasvat arrived, they had been drinking. \u2018\u2026I was wrong to expect something more substantive.\u2019Pour and drink. As soon as Vivasvat came into the unit\u2019s station, he heard those two words the most.Vivasvat tried to avoid drinking as much as possible, but every time he tried to slip away, his other crew members clung to him like ghosts and said, \u2018Drink! Drink! Down the chute!\u2019 They merrily watched him down a glass while they sang strange songs. If Vivasvat tried to clear his impending stupor and drunkenness by bringing out his magic powers, the others would rebuke him and say, \u2018Oh! Don\u2019t shrug off such a nice thing! Why waste alcohol!\u2019 Vivasvat heard this wherever he went. Eventually\u2026\u201cUgh!\u201d A few hours later, Vivasvat remained silent and still. He had completely emptied out everything inside his stomach long ago.\u201cHuh? What is this? Has our youngest vomited already?\u201d\u201cOh dear. He\u2019s a lightweight, no? We can\u2019t let him be so weak, right?\u201d\u201cThis can\u2019t do. Shouldn\u2019t we make sure that he toughens up?\u201d\u201cCome here, youngest! These upstanding colleagues of yours will help you.\u201d\u201cSince you\u2019ve already vomited, your stomach must be empty, right? Then you can drink some more! Down the chute! Bottoms up!\u201d\u2018These crazy bastards! Let me be!\u2019It made no sense that these people\u2019s logic told them that an empty stomach needed to be filled with more alcohol. However, Vivasvat could not scream out what he thought internally. Even if they knew what he was thinking, they would not change and just ignore him. \u2018Someone, help me!\u2019 For the first time since Vivasvat realized his power, he was gripped with a sense of crisis. He felt that he might really die.***\u2018\u2026are they really people?\u2019 The next day, when Vivasvat opened his eyes, he was horrified at the fact that he had no memory or recollection of how he passed out. He fell silent as he watched his colleagues walking around shirtless while conducting their morning routines.Vivasvat felt that he was on the verge of dying, as he was having a particularly bad hangover. However, his other colleagues had woken up in the morning and were conducting their duties without a hitch. Vivasvat wondered if they were the same people. Obviously, there was no sign of any of them utilizing their magic power to disperse the previous night\u2019s alcohol.\u201cOh! Has our youngest sleeping beauty awakened?\u201d\u201cHahaha. He has black bags under his eyes. So weak\u2026 How do you expect to get any work done being so weak?\u201dSeeing the other members of the unit treating him like a child, Vivasvat felt his insides boil. Though Vivasvat did not consider himself as someone special, he had always been in the spotlight wherever he went. He never thought that he would feel and be so thoroughly humiliated.Vivasvat would show them that he was not weak. Reluctant to lose out to his colleagues, Vivasvat was about to respond, but he soon felt a splitting headache and his insides churning once more. \u201cUgh.\u201d Without even taking a few steps, Vivasvat threw up, emptying his stomach once more.***\u201cHahaha! Why did you drink everything that was offered to you? You need to learn how to fend for yourself.\u201d\u2018These crazy bastards were the ones who forcibly fed me\u2026!\u2019\u201cThat\u2019s right. If you get too emotional, you\u2019ll get hurt.\u201d\u2018I wasn\u2019t planning on drinking!\u2019The first impression that Vivasvat had of Bifrost was that it was the \u2018worst\u2019 troop and environment. It was a group of drunkards who only liked to drink. If he stayed in this place a few more days, Vivasvat was unsure if he would be able to survive. However, Vivasvat could not easily leave. \u2018What is it about her?\u2019It was because Vivasvat\u2019s commander, Garmr, was always on his mind. \u2018With power comes responsibilities. Even if one has good intentions, the moment one acts, the impact on others follows.\u2019 Vivasvat could still recall the intense gaze that Garmr had when she conveyed this message.What\u2019s more, there were others in the troop who seemed to have quite good skills despite their ragged appearance. Even if they entered another society, they would be treated with respect. It seemed that many were already at a low-level god state, but they were choosing not to exuviate and transcend.Everything was full of mysteries for Vivasvat, so he wondered what the hell was going on. However, his questions were quickly resolved within a few days.\u201cCommander, if we enter, we might be annihilated, no?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll take time for reinforcements to arrive. Let\u2019s start with suppression.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThe troop members\u2019 actions and tones of voice may seem frivolous, but they were exact and calculative when conducting their missions. If they needed to act, they acted boldly. When facing the enemy on the battlefield, they would absolutely give their all. Sometimes, even Vivasvat felt his spine tingle. It was only later that Vivasvat learned that the nickname given to Bifrost from other societies was \u2018Crazy Whirlwind\u2019.\u201cCrazy Whirlwind! The Crazy Whirlwind has appeared! Argh!\u201d\u201cRun away! Just run\u2026 Ugh!\u201dIn particular, Garmr did not hesitate to stand at the forefront even though she was the commander of the unit. When she danced with her two ax-like swords, her enemy\u2019s heads tumbled like falling leaves in autumn. Her nickname \u2018Mad Dog\u2019 suited her well. Garmr had constantly stated that she had made the greatest contribution for Asgard when they defeated Olympus and gained their present-day prestige, after all.Of course, Vivasvat also possessed the power, so he often played a large role. Madman. He had acquired the nickname \u2018Madman\u2019 some time ago. He was known for being polite during normal times but losing his marbles and fighting like a madman during fights.Crazy Whirlwind. Mad Dog. Madman\u2026 It did not take long for rumors of these three to spread across the floors. Whenever people heard these words on the battlefield, they started running away without looking back. The achievements of the three soon spread throughout the Tower\u2019s world.***\u201cHahaha! Hey, I said it, right? I\u2019m right, no? When our youngest first appeared\u2026 I told you he shined with a bit of craziness, right? I thought I was blinded by the light of his madness\u2026!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re spewing bullshit again. He\u2019s a weakling who couldn\u2019t even hold down his drink properly. Weren\u2019t you saying that he was useless?\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s because I was concerned about feeding his ego\u2026!\u201dIt was one year later. Time went by very quickly, and Vivasvat was able to fully adapt to Bifrost during that time. For starters, his troop members were free-spirited, so they were not wary of Vivasvat\u2019s development. Now, if the members were to choose who the strongest and most needed person in the unit was, except for Garmr, everyone would, without hesitation, state Vivasvat.\u2018\u2026of course, they\u2019re still abusing me with alcohol.\u2019 But for whatever reason, Vivasvat could not hold down his liquor or showed any improvement in that department.\u2018I guess I\u2019m fortunate that they\u2019re relatively good-natured people.\u2019 Vivasvat now understood that he was amongst good people. Even if they brought fear to their enemies, they were respectful of each other. The unit had a good reputation in Asgard, and thus, they were treated with greater courtesy and respect than mere \u2018slaves\u2019 or \u2018captives\u2019.At some point, when Vivasvat was beginning to fully assimilate and get along with his unit\u2026 Vivasvat started feeling a heaviness in his heart. One day, when he would have to eventually turn away from Asgard. If he encountered Bifrost as an enemy, what would he do? Would he have to raise his hand against them? Would he even be able to fight against them properly?During his time in Asgard, Vivasvat clearly realized that not all \u2018gods\u2019 were the same. They, too, had friendships, loves, and possessed feelings of compassion and sympathy\u2026\u201cEveryone, quiet!\u201d Just as Vivasvat was deep in thought, Garmr suddenly slammed her hand down on the tabletop. She spoke in a serious manner, contrary to her usual pretentious manner of speech. Without further fuss, the troop members focused their attention on her.Vivasvat put aside his thoughts and focused on Garmr as well. It appeared that something serious had happened.\u201cA divine message was sent down from Valhalla a moment ago.\u201dIn an instant, all the troop members, including Vivasvat, gulped. A divine message from Valhalla. It was a simple yet heavy occurrence. \u2018Odin has awakened!\u2019Valhalla was the city where Odin resided. The doors to Valhalla were firmly closed while Odin was asleep, but whenever the doors were opened, Asgard was tossed into a frenzy. And at that time, like the main god who was in charge of the \u2018storm\u2019, a violent storm raged throughout the world of the Tower.\u201cIf I skip to the main point\u2026 They\u2019re saying that they\u2019re going to start recruiting an Einheri after not doing so for the past hundreds of years.\u201dMuffled exclamations erupted everywhere. Some even clenched their fists. Being able to become an Einheri as a member of Asgard was unquestionably a glory that any member wanted to achieve. By entering Valhalla and serving as Odin\u2019s servant, an Einheri would be able to develop and cultivate one\u2019s skills and powers in preparation for the coming \u2018Twilight of the Gods (Ragnar\u00f6k)\u2019. One would be able to dream and possibly reach the highest levels of society.Vivasvat was also excited with the news. His eyes lit up because he felt that his long-awaited opportunity had come much sooner than expected.\u201cOf course, there\u2019re conditions. First, one must pass an exam.\u201d\u201cWhat is the exam about?\u201d An impatient unit member blurted out a question with a serious expression.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been announced yet, but last night, I heard through the grapevine that Olympus declared war on Asgard.\u201d\u201c\u2026what?\u201d\u201cThose crazy bastards!\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re just itching for a beatdown!\u201d\u201cWait a minute. War is an opportunity to obtain great achievements, right?\u201dAlthough the troops were resentful at Olympus, who had not come to their senses even after having been beaten down continuously by them in the recent past, the troop members were able to realize that the coming war was a special opportunity.Garmr nodded heavily. \u201cAs you all can guess, it is Odin\u2019s will to select a warrior who has made great achievements in the all-out war against Olympus and welcome him or her to Valhalla. And to properly determine this, \u2018Valkyries\u2019 will be sent down to each unit.\u201dA Valkyrie was a special messenger between Valhalla and Asgard. Along with the Einheri, the Valkyries were the main forces that supported Odin. They were not known to show themselves much in public, but when the occasion arose, they stirred up a storm of chaos.Was Odin planning on participating in the war against Olympus? If so, this upcoming war would not end at the level of a minor dispute. Both Olympus and Asgard were large societies that made up the lion\u2019s share of the godly society. It was clear that there was going to be a great war. The social structure would be turned upside down.\u2018If I take advantage of this opportunity, I\u2019ll be able to gain access to many things.\u2019 Vivasvat felt a little excited at the thought of not only whittling down both godly societies through a war of attrition but also having the opportunity to observe firsthand the legends of the high-ranking gods on both sides. The more information he gathered on them, the more effectively he could move in the future. However\u2026\u2018Huh\u2026?\u2019 Vivasvat did not miss the look of displeasure that crossed Garmr\u2019s eyes, which was in stark contrast with the overwhelming enthusiasm coming from all the other troop members. He wondered what made Garmr so displeased.\u201cSo, let me introduce the Valkyrie who will be accompanying us in the future\u2026!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll introduce myself.\u201d At that moment, a woman cut Garmr off after pushing open the doors of the unit\u2019s building. She had steps filled with pride and arrogant eyes. The armor she wore shone brilliantly with a golden light. Just by looking at her, one could tell that she was a female warrior who possessed tremendous power.And with the woman\u2019s appearance, Garmr\u2019s expression hardened. Some members of the unit, noticing the identity of the Valkyrie who appeared, burst out with admiring gasps.The Valkyrie was known as the greatest amongst all the Valkyries\u2014Urd. Possessing excellent swordsmanship skills and having an eye that could glimpse into the past, she was said to be a gift of great knowledge for Odin! Additionally, the other two Valkyries that followed her were also widely known beings.\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cTo think that all three sisters would come here together\u2026!\u201dVerdandi, who could see the present, and Skuld, who could see the future. The three goddesses of fate who could see and predict the entire span of time of any existence. The three, who would later be better known as the \u2018three crippled goddesses\u2019 in the lower world, made their appearance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seriously, why was he always weak-hearted when it came to things related to Edora when he managed to do other things so well? He held a small wooden box in his right hand.If anyone else were to see Yeon-woo\u2019s creation, they would have burst out in admiration the moment they laid eyes on it. The wood, the main material used, was a hardwood that came from the roots of an ebony tree, which descended its roots deep into the lava fields and was exposed to heat for hundreds of years. The patterns engraved on the box were two geese so vividly sculpted that they seemed to be ready to take off at any moment. The life-like quality of the sculpted creatures just added to the box\u2019s splendor.The One-horned Tribe traditionally regarded the wild goose, along with the mandarin duck, as an animal that symbolized a couple\u2019s faithful affection. This was because geese lived for several decades while not giving up their monogamous lifestyle, always staying true to their single partner. Actually, if it was not for Henova\u2019s previous words, Yeon-woo would probably not have added this feature.\u201cWhat? You\u2019re only going to bring a ring?\u201d\u201cYeah, and maybe something to carry it in\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that enough?\u201d\u201cIdiot! How can you only bring those things?! What woman would appreciate a guy bringing just a pitiful ring while asking her to share her entire life with him?! Furthermore, don\u2019t you think Edora will know that you\u2019re about to propose if you act differently than usual? I\u2019m pretty sure she already has an idea, no?\u201d\u201cThen, what shall I do\u2026!\u201d\u201cYou must make a ring box that rivals the ring! You must pay attention to those finer details so that she\u2019ll be able to trust you as a provider and partner. If you just take a ring out of your pocket, do you think she\u2019ll feel that it\u2019s a special occasion? Don\u2019t you have a mind of your own? Think!\u201d\u201c\u2026You may be right.\u201d\u201cUgh! This idiot. All these spring chickens all think the same. How are you so insensitive? Tsk.\u201d\u201cThen, what shall I do?\u201d\u201cStay there for a second! An idea just came to mind.\u201dHenova slapped Yeon-woo, who was restless because he didn't know what to do, on the back of the head several times, and gave him some advice. Everything Henova mentioned sounded logical, so Yeon-woo had no choice but to admire Henova\u2019s breadth of knowledge. Henova was able to guide Yeon-woo to understand the nuances that he would have never thought of himself. In fact, Yeon-woo wondered if Henova, not Yeon-woo himself, was preparing to get married.\u201cDid you prepare a message? A proposal message?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cYou really are an idiot, or are you just plain stupid? Get your head on straight! Also, how are you planning to set the tone?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a secret.\u201d\u201cWhat? Secret? Why?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to tell you.\u201d\u201cHahaha. So, you do feel a little embarrassed, huh? Anyway, whatever, tell me! I\u2019m pretty sure you have some stupid plan that matches your idiocy. Wait, you\u2019re not planning to do it in a public place with other tribe members around, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026I was going to propose in the evening, when we\u2019re out for a walk.\u201d\u201cOho! It seems you saw something like that somewhere. What event do you have planned?\u201dAfter listening to Yeon-woo\u2019s pitiful response\u2026\u201cNo! You\u2019ll make her so embarrassed that she\u2019ll never be able to answer! A proposal needs to be swift with purpose and manliness! Not the flowery crap you have planned. Why is your head so far into the gutter? You must set the mood. The mood is key! Do you hear what I\u2019m saying?\u201dAfter giving Yeon-woo some pointers\u2026\u2018\u2026I\u2019ve already explained this much, this guy better pull this off. And he better not even think of blaming me if anything goes wrong!\u2019Yeon-woo could not help but chuckle while watching Henova jump up and down with fervor. He knew that, no matter how spiteful Henova\u2019s words seemed, they were all things that were said to benefit him. Among the people around him, Yeon-woo knew that Henova wanted the best for him and Edora.To Henova, Yeon-woo was like a son, and Edora was a child he grew to love while interacting with the One-horned Tribe over all these years. Even the sword she held and used was created by Henova. Thus, this occasion was very personal for Henova. Fortunately, not every word from Henova was a scolding word.\u201cWell, it\u2019s good that you thought of creating a ring yourself.\u201dIt took a lot longer than Yeon-woo expected to finish the casting, as each iteration did not seem to come out in the shape he desired. Still, in the end, Yeon-woo held a pair of beautiful rings.Grasp!\u00a0Yeon-woo tightened his hold around the wooden box.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dAfter taking a breath, the tension seemed to have eased a little.\u201cBy the way, Henova\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHow is someone who\u2019s so well versed in what women like still a solo?\u201d\u201cThis bastard\u2026\u201dWhen Yeon-woo recalled what had happened just before he left the smithy, he burst into laughter. It was always enjoyable for Yeon-woo to see Henova all worked up. Though he should not joke around with someone at Henova\u2019s advanced age and increase his blood pressure, Yeon-woo could not help the sly remarks and replies from coming out. It seemed Yeon-woo was truly comfortable around Henova.\u2018Thank you, Henova.\u2019 Yeon-woo quietly expressed his deepest gratitude to a man who was like his father.\u00a0Step. Step.\u00a0He began to move his steps to where Edora was.***\u201cYeon-woo, are you here?\u201dEdora was watering a flower bed. She looked very pretty in a white dress with frills as she hummed about and watered the flowers. So, without realizing it, Yeon-woo stood tall and stared blankly at the scene for a long time.Originally, Yeon-woo was going to surprise her by sneaking up carefully from behind\u2026but he could not. And, feeling someone around, Edora had called out. She turned around to look at Yeon-woo when he did not immediately answer.Yeon-woo regained his senses, but his full reasoning ability did not. It was because the scent of flowers and Edora\u2019s scent mixed in the breeze blew in his direction, and there was a mint scent that made his heart pound\u2026 It drove him crazy.At that moment, Yeon-woo\u2019s proposal plan, which he had come up with Henova, was instantly blown away. It was as if a small demon resembling Edora had appeared and shattered his detailed plan with a large hammer. Hence\u2026\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dYeon-woo walked closer to Edora, as if possessed by something.Edora tried to ask Yeon-woo where he had been, but when she saw his hardened expression, she made a similar expression. She wondered if something wrong had happened while she was asleep in bed.\u201cEdora.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dYeon-woo knelt on one knee in front of Edora. \u201cWill you marry me?\u201dYeon-woo rummaged inside his pockets and pulled out a small wooden box, then quietly opened the lid.\u00a0Click.\u00a0Inside the wooden box, two rings could be seen side by side on a soft cotton pad. There were no special patterns or decorations, but the rings sparkled beautifully. The lack of lavish adornments made the ring seem to sparkle and catch one\u2019s eye even more.Edora was in a daze after she heard Yeon-woo\u2019s words and saw the rings being pulled out. The words \u201cwill you marry me\u2026\u201d stuck in her chest.On the other hand, still down on one knee and watching the startled and unresponsive Edora, Yeon-woo felt as if he was splashed with cold water. He instantly recovered his reasoning and consciousness. It was then that he realized how stupid and rash he had been. It was an impulsive proposal\u2026 He did not even set the mood or even present the event he had planned.Now that he was in this predicament, Yeon-woo wondered how he strayed so far from what he had planned. He knew that Henova would have a field day with his arrogance and aloofness. \u201cSo, um, I mean\u2026 Let\u2019s be together\u2026\u201d Yeon-woo was trying to salvage his mistake.\u201cYes.\u201d Edora snatched the box that was in Yeon-woo\u2019s hand. Her face was flushed red, and tears welled up in the corners of her eyes. \u201cWill you place the ring on my finger?\u201dEdora looked so pretty at that moment that Yeon-woo was left staring blankly. Belatedly, he regained his footing and hastily got up to put the ring on Edora\u2019s ring finger. Edora\u2019s fingers were slender, but her hands were full of calluses from years of martial arts training. However, for Yeon-woo, her fingers and hands could not look more beautiful.The ring was a perfect fit. Edora touched it carefully and smiled broadly. \u201cI love you.\u201d***\u201cCain proposed to Edora!\u201dThe news of Yeon-woo and Edora quickly spread throughout the village. It spread so quickly that the two were unable to take any action.\u201cWhat? Is that true?\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s true! You know that youngest son of the Nen family\u2026 The one who often cuts grass, right?\u201d\u201cOh, you mean the idiot who doesn\u2019t listen to anyone? What about him?\u201d\u201cHe was scheduled to cut the grass on the princess\u2019 property, so when he got there, he saw the whole thing go down. At first, Cain\u2019s expression was so serious that he wondered if something had happened to Cain and Edora\u2026 But then he saw the rings!\u201d\u201cUgh! I wish I had been there, too!\u201d\u201cRight! I\u2019m so curious about what expression our beloved and proud little princess made!\u201dEdora and Cain were so absorbed in the proposal that they did not pay attention to their surroundings.Originally, Yeon-woo was planning on gaining the blessings from the Martial King and Psychic Medium before proposing. However, now that the rumors were spreading like wildfire, it seemed that the Martial King and Psychic Medium would hear the news before he could deliver it. Moreover, Edora also did not want the whole village to know of the proposal, which she had an inkling of, but things just happened to progress in an unexpected way.\u201cOur ice princess is getting married!\u201d\u201cWe cannot stay still!\u201d\u201cWhat shall we start with, what do we do first?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018what should we start with\u2019? There\u2019s only one thing.\u201dThe members of the tribe were already rapidly discussing among themselves. After all, this was a village where there was nothing interesting to do except to practice martial arts. So, for them, the marriage of Yeon-woo and Edora was an event worth celebrating together, but it was also a plaything for them to clear their heads and work together.\u201cFirst, we need to build something to honor the groom and bride. A marriage between a disciple of the Tribal chief and his princess! Shouldn\u2019t the rest of the Tower, no, everyone in the world, know about it!\u201d\u201cOoh!\u201d\u201cCome on! Let\u2019s start with the wedding invitations!\u201dThe tribe members first selected the finest silk as the material for the wedding invitations, saying that the value of the tribe should not be seen as low. The silk they chose was made from silkworms that had slept for over a hundred years. Furthermore, these silkworms were said to be born only after receiving the aura of the moonlight for several hundreds of years. For this reason, the silk made from these silkworms was very precious as it possessed the qualities of \u2018poison immunity and general indestructibility\u2019. It was also a useful material to create outstanding artifacts.However, the members of the tribe did not hesitate to pull out a great amount of this silk, which they had grown and held onto, to print wedding invitations. In addition, they also went to absurd lengths of coating the invitations with gold leafing and sprinkling them with precious scenting oils. They then sent these invitations to all the major clans in the Tower.Edora said she felt embarrassed and tried to stop the others from taking these dramatic actions, but she could not stop her tribe members, especially since they were already on a roll. It also did not help Edora that her tribe members were all skilled in martial arts, making the preparation, creation, and dissemination of such extravagant invitations a breeze.The contents of the wedding invitation were as follows\u2026If you don\u2019t come to the wedding, you\u2019ll be thoroughly trampled on.When the Red Dragon clan collapsed, no one in the world could ignore the One-horned Tribe, who had taken over the seat as the most powerful force in the Tower. Though Allforone\u2019s sudden disappearance threw a wrench in the power dynamics, the One-horned Tribe members did not give this any thought.\u201cI\u2019ve handed out all the wedding invitations. What\u2019s next?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s set up a monument to celebrate the groom and bride!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s start with the statues of Cain and Edora, who have brought glory to our tribe! Really large, humongous statues!\u201dAt those words, all the eyes of the members of the tribe twinkled.\u201cWhere should we make the statues?\u201d\u201cThey should be very flamboyant and flashy! But\u2026we\u2019re not capable of that.\u201dAlthough the tribe members were lost in thought for a moment\u2026\u201cWhew! Don\u2019t worry about those details. I\u2019ve already got everything ready.\u201dAs if waiting for his time to speak, someone shouted in a confident tone. The members of the tribe turned their heads to see who spoke up, and when they saw the face of the person who was shouting at the top of his lungs, the color soon drained from their faces.***\u201cPull it right, One! Two! Three!\u201d\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cHey, you idiots! Pull correctly? At this rate, the statues will fall backwards!\u201d\u201cOkay! Everyone, repeat after me! Pull!\u201d\u201cPull!\u201dDozens of members of the tribe were standing next to each other and pulling a rope, and a huge statue, which seemed to be about thirty meters tall, was slowly rising. Henova had his arms crossed and looked at the developments with great delight.Slap!\u201c\u2026I felt something ominous brewing.\u201d Yeon-woo covered his face with his hands. He wondered if he might have to bring out his mask and wear it. Edora had already run off somewhere, stating that she did not want to be present.A statue was going up. It was a statue of Yeon-woo holding Vigrid high with a dignified face and Edora smiling with an elegant posture next to him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Second Life RankerCH ss - 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySide Story Chapter 21 - One-horn (6)Wouldn\u2019t a laurel wreath with twigs from divine cedar look pretty?Phante started running around the Tower to make what Edora had called the most suitable and \u2018best dress\u2019. The floors? The tests? What was the use of those things? Phante was just going to ram past everything.\u201cAha!\u201dDivine cedar was a tree said to be blessed by the gods and demons who resided on the ninety-eighth floor. For this reason, among the players living in the Tower, the people of faith tended to visit this place the most. They hoped that their voices would be better delivered, even just a little better, to the gods and demons that they worshiped. The rumor was that the divine cedar originated from a fallen branch of the World Tree.So, the moment Phante appeared on top of such a tree and did something unspeakable, all the gathered players, who had been praying with reverence, screamed aloud.\u201cW-What is that\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhy is the One-horned Tribe over there\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell is that madman doing?!\u201d\u201cAck! No!\u201dWhen Phante first appeared atop the divine cedar tree, the gathered players did not take him too seriously, saying, \u2018Another One-horned Tribe member doing something One-horned\u2019. They did not appreciate that a being was sullying the sacred tree by standing atop of it, but they were unable to do anything since they were not confident in fighting against such a fierce foe, especially one from the One-horned Tribe. They just hoped that he would get bored of playing around and leave. However, the man suddenly grabbed the trunk of the divine cedar and shook it recklessly!They questioned whether the large divine cedar tree would bend just because this crazy guy grabbed it and shook it, but the divine cedar tree swayed and creaked very loudly. It was as if it were a bamboo tree that was being hit by the wind and rain. Thanks to this, the tree\u2019s leaves started to fall like raindrops and several small and large branches started to pour down non-stop.The gathered players, who were praying in the shade of the tree, had no choice but to run out. If they remained under the tree, the falling matter might break their heads. The fleeing players and those observing the scene from afar all turned pale.Not caring about what others were thinking, Phante shook the divine cedar tree for a long time until he gathered as many branches as he wanted. \u201cHmm\u2026 Is this more than I need?\u201d The basket that Phante was carrying on his back was bursting with divine cedar branches.\u201cIt probably doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Phante wanted to err on the safe side, so he decided that he would rather have more branches than not enough. After getting what he wanted, Phante quickly left the scene. In the place where he disappeared\u2026Whoosh!\u201cAh, ah, ah\u2026!\u201d\u201cThe d-divine cedar\u2026!\u201d\u201cGod, oh my god!\u201d\u201cWhy is this happening to us\u2026!\u201dAll the leaves had fallen off and only a few bare branches remained.***\u201cArachne\u2019s thread! I\u2019ve heard that dresses made from it sparkle beautifully, like finely ground gemstones.\u201dArachne was a being known for its exceptional skill in handling threads. It was to the extent that there were legends of how it competed evenly with Athena, a major god of Olympus. But, according to the legends, Arachne believed so firmly in its own abilities that it became arrogant and slandered the gods. This led to it being cursed by the gods and forced to live as a spider species, both for Arachne and her offspring.This was why it was difficult to deal with monsters with the name \u2018Arachne\u2019. The Arachne, who took on the form of a spider, spewed its thread from someplace near its butt region. The thread that came out was very sticky, full of viscosity, and so elastic that it could not be cut easily, no matter how sharp one\u2019s knife or sword.Since the Arachne lived in groups, their threads were always used in their nests, creating a natural trap from which intruders could not escape. That's why even high-ranking players tended to avoid the Arachne\u2019s nests.\u201cGive it up.\u201dAlong the pathway where Phante had burst across, the bodies of dead Arachne littered the ground, with their bodies flipped over and their spider legs crumbled inward. As a bonus, Phante was able to secure several ejection organs near the corpses\u2019 buttocks. He piled the loot into the basket on his back.\u201cGive it up!\u201dThe ejection organ was the anus through which the Arachne excreted waste. Because of this, in the eyes of the Arachne who were still in their nests, Phante was seen as a rampaging pervert who was ginning for their butts, literally.\u201cGive it to me!\u201dEvery time their eyes met with Phante\u2019s, like a madman, Phante would shout out \u2018Give it up! Give it to me! Gimme it!\u2019 The scene of such a crazed, shouting character induced fear for the Arachne. Furthermore, the Arachne could not properly understand human speech. However, without understanding what he was saying, they knew what he was after with fanatical obsession and greed! Their asses!Phante\u2019s roars made their nests shake and thump, inducing greater terror and fear for all the Arachne.The Arachne were reputed to be the apex predators around this region, but this newly arrived player was way above their heads, no, their asses!Kee!Kee! Kee! Kee!The butt pervert has appeared! You must protect your asses!The Arachne scattered all over the place to avoid Phante. They ran awkwardly with several of their legs covering their rears, trying to protect their butts from being exposed.\u201cHey! Give it to me! Give it! Hahaha! Butts everywhere! Ass here! Ass there! Hahaha\u2026!\u201dKee!\u00a0The Arachne nests filled with cries as Phante\u2019s deranged shouts got louder. And then\u2026Kee\u2026\u00a0Arachne, the boss who was at the innermost part of the nest, trembled and closed its eyes tightly. It possessed the largest ass. It was obvious what fate would soon befall it.***\u201cOn the thirtieth floor, in the Sea of Death, the pearls that are at the bottom of the sea\u2026\u201dSince Edora stated that she wanted pearls to decorate her dress, Phante had overturned the entire Sea of Death, which boasted an enormous size that covered an entire three floors.Because of this, natural disasters occurred one after another, such as storm surges and volcanic eruptions\u2026 But Phante paid no attention. He was beyond a nuisance. He had become a moving disaster zone.***\u201cOn the forty-first floor, there\u2019s a bird called Heavenly Stork\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm, I raced out so quickly to gather the materials that I didn\u2019t quite hear what type of feather she wanted.\u201dWhen he listened to his sister\u2019s words, Phante thought it would not be too difficult to gather the bird\u2019s feathers, but the bird, the Heavenly Stork, that Edora spoke of boasted a formidable size, exceeding twenty meters in height.Even though the Heavenly Stork possessed so many different feathers that Phante could not tell exactly which one was needed. The more gorgeous feathers were limited to the area around the bird\u2019s tail, but Phante, who did not possess an ounce of aesthetic taste, was unable to recognize it.\u201d\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Phante smiled broadly. \u201cI\u2019ll just kill them off and take them all with me.\u201dBoom!\u00a0And on that day, a mountain range that occupied more than half of the stage on the forty-first floor completely collapsed.***In a short time, Phante roamed the Tower\u2019s world. Who else\u2019s older brother would work so hard for his precious sister?\u2018Hahaha. I hope she doesn\u2019t cry too much from appreciation.\u2019 Phante envisioned Edora weeping from appreciation, so his shoulders naturally became broader, and subsequently, he carried himself with greater confidence.Edora, from the previous time period, always told Phante that, \u2018as you get older, your brain is turning more into pure muscle\u2019.Phante was adamant to change that sentiment during this time period. Rather, he would make sure that Edora looked up to him with eyes full of respect and admiration!\u2018If I can make that happen\u2026! If I can get her onto my side, and since she has a hold on Yeon-woo, I\u2019ll finally be able to escape that tyrant\u2019s grasp! Then, I\u2019ll be able to throw my weight around as his brother-in-law!\u2019 In fact, this was the secret motivation that spurred Phante into action. Did it matter what motivated him? If he could act like a good older brother and gain some benefits at the same time\u2026Phante was already imagining a world where Yeon-woo was calling him \u2018brother-in-law\u2019 with a respectful face. In the One-horned Tribe, who followed tradition strictly, these titles and manners carried great weight. \u2018Very good. Very good. Hahaha!\u2019 His happiness was shooting upwards to the moon.***\u201c\u2026What is all this?\u201d After leaving Yeon-woo and the Martial King in the meeting room, who both said they had something to share with each other, Edora frowned. She was concerned that her father was going to ask Yeon-woo to do something absurd\u2026 However, Edora was soon ambushed from an unexpected place\u2026\u201cThey\u2019re\u2026formal complaints.\u201d The head elder pressed his fingers against his stinging temples. Edora could feel the head elder\u2019s deep anger as he continued to speak through clenched teeth.Scrolls were piled high enough to fill one wall of the hallway. The problem was that other members of the tribe continued to bring out and pile on more scrolls.\u201cLetters of complaint\u2026 Huh?\u201d Edora felt a chill running up her spine.\u201cYes. Phante! That idiotic bastard is running around wreaking havoc everywhere.\u201dThe head elder tossed the scrolls he held in his hand as he ground his teeth.\u201cThis complaint states that the divine cedar tree has become barren, as all of its leaves and most of its branches have been torn off. It has completely lost its divine ability and connection to the heavenly world.\u201dPlop.\u201cThis complaint is from the Tower\u2019s administrative branch office. They\u2019re saying that the Sea of Death on the twenty-eighth floor has suddenly dried up, rendering it impossible to operate the stage any longer.\u201dPlop.\u201cThis complaint is about something being burned in the river on the eleventh floor. All those who drink from the river have gotten excruciating stomach aches.\u201dPlop...\u201cThe whole forty-first floor\u2019s mountain range was blown away, so there are no mobs that allow players to raise their stats. And this complaint\u2026\u201dPlop. Plop. Plop.\u00a0As the scrolls fell one by one, Edora\u2019s expression changed moment by moment. All this destruction could not be considered trivial. Natural disasters, desolate winds\u2026 Phante was leaving a wake of destruction as he tore across the Tower\u2019s floors. The damage went far beyond affecting just one or two players or clans. Phante\u2019s actions had stopped the operation of several stages on different floors.If Phante was left alone, the accumulated damage may become irreversible, so despite the fear of the One-horned Tribe, the players had sent complaints as a collective group. Even the Tower\u2019s administrative office asked what the heck was going on\u2026 Truly, the entire ecosystem of the Tower was being messed up because of Phante.\u2018What the hell is that idiot brother of mine doing?\u2019 Edora understood that the only person who could do such a thing was the Phante who came from the future with Yeon-woo. She thought he would be old enough to know better\u2026! Somehow, it did not seem like age corresponded with wisdom or intelligence for her brother. No, in many ways, he seemed to be getting younger. Edora felt a massive headache coming on.\u2018How is his head only full of muscles!\u2019 This was not in reference to Phante\u2019s anatomy, wherein the brain was essentially a muscle, biologically. Edora felt that Phante\u2019s soul was ruled by reincarnated muscle. Even after getting married, she was worried that Phante would continue causing accidents like this and drag Yeon-woo down with him.\u00a0Tremble. Tremble.\u00a0Edora\u2019s insides boiled.\u201cAnd do you know what this is?\u201d\u201c\u2026What is it?\u201dSomehow, Edora\u2019s anxiety grew.\u201cPhante beat down the advance squad on the seventy-seventh floor, which was dispatched to investigate the disappearance of Allforone, because they were making too much noise.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnyway, as if he\u2019s not Nayu\u2019s son\u2026!\u201dThe head elder frowned as he remembered the Martial King\u2019s youth. The Martial King used to fight all the time and caused accident after accident when he was young. For some reason, the head elder\u2019s anger grew as he recalled the headaches he had to face during that time. At that moment\u2026\u201cI! I have been wronged!\u201d Someone shouted from outside. It was Phante\u2026 The Phante of the current time period was caught and dragged by various tribe members. Phante had drool all over his mouth as he screamed bloody murder. He was passionately stating the injustice of his incrimination. It seemed that he was suffering harm due to the actions of the Phante from the future.\u2018Such a troublemaker\u2026\u2019 Edora had to press her forehead with her index fingers. She had an ominous feeling that sooner or later, she would become as wrinkly as the head elder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 51": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Second Life RankerCH ss - 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySide Story Chapter 42 - The Third Zone (2)\u2018That person\u2026 is So-yeong\u2019s uncle?\u2019 From behind the second-floor banister, Min Chae-young peeked out with wide eyes. She looked at the man with eyes and hair as dark as the night sky, and a composed attitude and walk. The man looked indifferent, but he was good-looking. He closely resembled Sesha, who appeared cold on the outside but was actually the nicest person ever.Well, it made sense they resembled each other. Chase-young had heard Sesha\u2019s dad and uncle were identical twins. A part of Chae-young had always wanted to meet Yeon-woo because Sesha spoke about him so much. He was someone who sacrificed his entire life for his family. Sesha said without him, nor she, her mother, grandmother, and grandfather would be able to live the lives they did today.Chae-young didn\u2019t know the specifics, but Yeon-woo seemed to be outstanding as a player too. So when Sesha called out \u201cuncle\u201d in a bright voice, Chae-young realized it was Yeon-woo and snuck expectant glances at him. Even if she wanted to say hi, he probably didn\u2019t know her at all. But\u2026\u2018\u2026He\u2019s scary.\u2019 That was the first thing that popped into Min Chae-young\u2019s head. No, actually, it wasn\u2019t enough to express what she felt. Yeon-woo felt so far like he was something she would never be able to reach. It wasn\u2019t possible to describe him as being vast either. He was just so colossal it was hard to see his limits.Once, Chae-young had seen a video that explained Earth\u2019s size. She saw how small Earth was when it was compared to other planets, and how many galaxies with larger planets there were\u2026she felt dizzy just by looking at it.That was how she felt looking at Yeon-woo. No, it was even more than that. With Earth, she was able to grasp sizes, but with Yeon-woo, she could\u00a0feel\u00a0it. Something in her head shook. It was like a spool of thread she didn\u2019t even know existed had been unraveled. Min Chae-young flinched, not understanding what it was.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u300c\u2026\u300dThen, Min Chae-young made eye contact with Yeon-woo, who turned in her direction. Min Chae-young jumped in surprise and hid behind the banister again.\u00a0Thump, thump, thump!\u00a0However, her surprised heart wouldn\u2019t calm down\u2014as if it was still alive.* * *\u300eHubby! Sob, sob. You\u2019re too cruel. How could you! How could you leave me! What did a poor girl like me do for you to leave\u2026 You\u2019re so mean\u2026!\u300fIf someone heard this, they\u2019d think it was a pitiful young wife resenting her old lover for leaving. However, the voice was husky and rough, and the person pretending to be a pitiful young lady was a skinhead with copper skin.\u201c\u2026I wish I was blind.\u201d Sesha seriously contemplated poking her eyes with her fingers. That idiot, Laplace, stopped at nothing. Where did he find the courage to act like that while she was in the middle of tattling on him? Did he lose all sense of fear because he\u2019d already died once? Or did he really just enjoy being beaten up? She didn\u2019t understand. To be precise, she didn\u2019t even want to understand.Kronos, who had seen Laplace\u2019s absurd actions as much as Sesha had, looked disgusted too. Only Rhea was smiling, her hand covering her mouth with an \u201coh, dear\u201d motion. Sesha felt like her grandmother was too kind to Laplace. She said something about how Laplace was very cute or something. It was an insight Sesha didn\u2019t want to have.\u201c\u2026Laplace.\u201d Yeon-woo covered his face with a palm, as if he felt a migraine coming on, and sighed. Laplace had been like that in the Tower, and apparently, he was\u00a0still\u00a0like that.\u300eYes, Master! Please speak! Is there anything you\u2019d like to order me to do? Perhaps a warm bath? Lunch? Or\u2026!\u300fLaplace paused his pitiful wife act and suddenly spun like a top. Then, the clothes he was wearing made popping noises and transformed into a maid outfit\u2015he was copying the \u201cmagical girl\u201d outfits from the tv shows Sesha watched when she was younger. He slightly lifted his skirts and made a high-pitched squeal. It was an instant transformation. The dark legs showing from beneath the short dress were thick and hairy.Sesha and Kronos had dumbfounded expressions. All emotion disappeared from Yeon-woo\u2019s face as well. His face didn\u2019t seem to have any blood.\u201cGet down on your head.\u201d\u300eOh my, so dirty. Can\u2019t you see I\u2019m wearing a dress?\u300fBased on how Laplace winked, it was clear he still wasn\u2019t in his right mind.\u201c\u2026Sesha.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. Uncle.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201c\u2026No. I\u2019m u-used to it\u2026now. Ha, hahaha\u2026!\u201d The joy was absent from Sesha\u2019s laughter.Laplace seemed to be in even higher spirits now that Yeon-woo had returned.\u201cDo you have any carrots at home?\u201d\u201cCarrots?\u201d Sesha tilted her head at Yeon-woo\u2019s random question. But just then, Laplace visibly flinched, and Sesha\u2019s gaze whipped toward him. Laplace whistled, pretending as if nothing happened, but he couldn\u2019t avoid Sesha\u2019s sharp eyes. She narrowed her eyes at him and asked, \u201cHey, pervert bunny.\u201d\u300eHuhuhu. What is it?\u300f\u201cYou\u2019re sweating.\u201d\u300eI-I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u2026! Huhuhu!\u300f\u201cUncle, carrots, right?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cJust a minute. We have some left over from last night.\u201d Sesha didn\u2019t know what it was, but it was related to that perverted bunny\u2019s weakness! She made a dash to the kitchen, and Laplace hurled his body at her with wide eyes.\u300eMiss Sesha! Stooooop!\u300fHowever, the shadow moved before Laplace\u2019s large body was airborne. The shadow let out tens of tentacles and left him tied on the ground.\u300eNoooooo!\u300fFor the first time, Laplace, the creature who panted no matter how hard he was beaten, was crying out for real. In the meantime, Sesha quickly brought a carrot from the fridge and waved it in front of Laplace.\u300eEeeeek!\u300fLaplace screamed, twisting to move away from the carrot.\u300eGet it away! Please! Pleasepleaseplease\u2026.! To somewhere I can\u2019t see it\u2026! Ahhhhhh! The juice from the carrot is falling\u2026! Ahhhhhhh! It touched me! My skin! My milky skin is rotting! Rotting! Ahhhhh!\u300f\u201c\u2026\u201dThe pale Laplace was really terrified of the carrot, and when water drops remaining from washing the carrot fell on his foot\u2026he made a ruckus. It was as if he touched something no being should ever touch.Sesha looked at Laplace\u2019s foot to see if his skin was really melting as he screamed, but the water just dripped down his leg normally. He was completely fine. However, he rolled around the middle of the living room in fear.When Sesha and Kronos looked at Yeon-woo with speechless faces, Yeon-woo responded with a shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know either. But that punk is strangely terrified of carrots. Oh, he hated onions too. Try using that next time.\u201dSesha had a dumbfounded expression again. Although it was due to a different reason than before, Laplace was the cause of both. \u2018A carrot-hating bunny\u2026\u2019The idea that bunnies loved carrots was actually only something that originated from a famous portrayal of an animated bunny, but bunnies didn\u2019t hate carrots either. However, that didn\u2019t seem to be the case for Laplace. Logic went out of the window with this perverted bunny.\u2018\u2026I see.\u2019Smirk!\u00a0However, none of that was important. Sesha had a huge grin as she looked at the carrot. To Laplace, she seemed like a vicious predator who\u2019d discovered her prey. She said, \u201cUncle, hold tight to him please.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d More shadow tentacles soared out and wrapped around Laplace when Yeon-woo replied. It cocooned Laplace, making it impossible for him to move.\u201cHa\u2026haha! Hahahahaha!\u201d Sesha couldn\u2019t contain the laughter that came from deep within. Her bizarre laughter only increased in volume as she strode toward Laplace.\u00a0Thump! Thump!\u00a0Each of her footsteps echoed in Laplace\u2019s ear like she was an executioner coming to finish him off. \u201cHehehehe.\u201d\u300eM-Miss Sesha! W-W-Why don\u2019t we c-calm down first?\u300f\u201cCalm down? Calm downnnnn?!\u201d Sesha\u2019s neck twisted at an odd angle.Sweat beaded on Laplace\u2019s copper skin.\u300eY-Y-Yes. P-Please calm down. O-Our cute and a-adorable Miss S-Sesha is someone who k-knows how to be k-kind to others. S\u2013S-So please put that horrifying object d-down and\u2026!\u300f\u201cSure. I\u2019ll put it down. Here.\u201dThe location Sesha was speaking about was on Laplace\u2019s knee.\u300eN-N-N\u2026!\u300f\u201cUncle, please shut this guy\u2019s mouth!\u201d\u300eUrp! Urrrrrp, urp!\u300fLaplace continued to make a ruckus even while tied up, but he couldn\u2019t resist Yeon-woo\u2019s binds.\u00a0Tak!\u00a0The moment the carrot landed on his knee, he let out a pitched scream.\u300eEeeeeeek!\u300fIt was an unspoken secret that Laplace fainted for the first time in his life that day. Of course, no one pitied him.* * *\u300e\u2026H-hegh. I\u2019ve been dirtied. I\u2019ve been dirtied, I tell you.\u300fLaplace sniffed despondently.Yeon-woo, Sesha, and the rest of the family paid Laplace no mind as they began to speak.\u201cAnyhow, what\u2019s with the sudden visit? I was thinking of going to see you actually.\u201d\u201cDid something happen?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later since it\u2019s a rather long story. More importantly, why are you here?\u201dYeon-woo realized Kronos\u2019 voice was slightly somber, and he looked at the banister. He could feel a familiar energy\u2026something similar to the Martial King\u2019s. He thought that might have to do with why Kronos sought him out.So like Kronos asked, Yeon-woo wanted to explain the reason for his visit first. \u201cFather, Mother.\u201d\u201cWhy are you being so serious? You\u2019re making me worry.\u201d\u201cOf course, go ahead, son.\u201dYeon-woo nodded heavily at Kronos and Rhea\u2019s responses. \u201cI\u2019m going to get married.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was a bolt from the blue. Kronos, Rhea, and Sesha all dropped their mouths open. Kronos, who was the most surprised, chuckled in disbelief and stood up. \u201c\u2026It seems like this conversation will get much longer, so I\u2019ll go bring us some drinks.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All the students had left to go home, and the school was quiet. Amid the busily moving staff members, Shin Sung-chan saw Cha So-yeong from far away. She was drinking warm tea given to her by some staff member. The hazy face behind the white steam from the tea was beautiful. Shin Sung-chan felt his back straighten. He was being pathetic.The small demon inside Shin Sung-chan that always gave him courage began to shout in his ear.\u00a0So-yeong is here to see you, you fool! So get yourself together, Shin Sung-chan! Straighten your shoulders and walk confidently!\u2018Yeah! So-yeong is here to see me! So act manly and confident! Muster the courage and go talk to her\u2026!\u2019 Sung-chan quickly recalled a phrase, saying that only the brave got the beautiful women.Sesha would\u2019ve looked at him more icily if she knew what he was thinking\u2015she hated it when people she didn\u2019t even like pushed themselves at her.Shin Sung-chan slapped himself on the cheeks.\u00a0Thwak! Thwak!\u00a0His manager looked at him with a \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with him now?\u201d expression. Shin Sung-chan was fine in all aspects, but a fault of his was that he often counted his chickens before they hatched, and he ended up digging his own grave. The manager always had to keep a close eye on him.Shin Sung-chan strided toward where Sesha was. In his head, he repeated to himself \u201cbe natural\u201d again and again. He intended on walking toward her naturally and nonchalantly starting up a conversation. However, contrary to his wishes, he was acting noticeably nervous. His movements were jerky like a broken robot.The first to notice Shin Sung-chan were Sesha and Park Yoo-min, who had been chatting with each other. Park Yoo-min narrowed her eyes at the sweating Shin Sung-chan. She could easily tell why he had come here and what he was thinking.\u2018So many fun things happen with So-yeong around!\u2019 Park Yoo-min enjoyed observing who broke down and stuttered in front of Sesha. It was also fun to watch Sesha\u2019s indifferent attitude toward them even though Sesha disapproved of Yoo-min\u2019s cruel hobby.\u201cOh, Sung-chan. Hi.\u201d\u201cU-Uh yeah\u2026 H-Hi?\u201d Sung-chan jerked his hand in a wave. His eyes weren\u2019t focused on Yoo-min, who greeted him, but he kept peeking at Sesha.Sesha continued to sip her tea with an indifferent expression. She hadn\u2019t drank tea in a long time, and it was nice and warm.\u201cS-So-young.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cH-Hi.\u201d\u201cYeah. Hi.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSesha continued to drink her tea again, and Sung-chan\u2019s expression turned glum. The conversation starters he\u2019d thought about before walking over had all left his head, and he couldn\u2019t come up with anything. His mind turned blank in front of Sesha. The only thought that came to mind was \u2018she looks pretty drinking tea too.\u2019\u201c\u2026\u201d Shin Sung-chan turned to ice, and Sesha was uncaring.Tsk, tsk.\u00a0Park Yoo-min internally clicked her tongue. At this rate, they\u2019d just be wasting time. She decided to help Sung-chan a bit for her own amusement. \u201cHey, what about the thing I asked for last time?\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026? What thing?\u201dPark Yoo-min wrinkled her forehead. \u201cHm? You didn\u2019t forget, did you? I asked you to get me Jin-ho oppa\u2019s signature!\u201d\u201cOh, that? Of course. How many do you need?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want signatures that were written like they\u2019re factory-made. My name\u2019s on there too, right?\u201d\u201cO-Of course\u2026\u201d Shin Sung-chan nodded frantically. How could he not listen to Yoo-min\u2019s request when she was the best friend of his crush? If he couldn\u2019t get to Sesha, Sung-chan needed to gain the hearts of the people around her.Thanks to Yoo-min, Sung-chan was able to start a conversation about a member in his group, and Sesha occasionally joined in.Sung-chan clenched his fists. Tonight, he\u2019d show an impressive side of himself and score points that way! Although he didn\u2019t know if things would go the way he wanted\u2026* * *\u201cWow, it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve remained at school for this long.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re sure it\u2019s not your first time?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll seem like a slacker if I say that.\u201dWith Producer Kim\u2019s signal, the cameras began to roll. It was only for a short moment, but Sung-chan\u2019s face was filled with happiness at having spoken to Sesha. Thanks to this, Sung-chan\u2019s speech throughout the recording was very smooth and natural.\u201cI like him because he\u2019s so simple-minded.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Sesha tilted her head at Yoo-min.\u201cNothing. It\u2019s just something little kids wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d Sesha furrowed her eyebrows at what her demon-like friend was scheming this time, but Yoo-min just smiled. \u2018How smart of me to think she\u2019ll tell me.\u2019Sesha turned back to the shadows. \u2018Hey, pervert bunny.\u2019\u300cHaa haa! Please continue to hurt me like that! I love it so much! From Master to you\u2026! The Cha family is inviting me to a world of endorphins and adrenaline with all the pain! Haa, haa, haa.\u300dSesha realized she made a mistake. It was best to quickly change the subject during times like this. \u2018It\u2019s not you, is it?\u2019\u300cHuhuhuhu! It\u2019s true I\u2019m a pervert, and I did consider antagonizing the school, but I\u2019ve never left your shadow. If Master catches me, he will erase me immediately.\u300dLaplace was saying he wouldn\u2019t be idle in his duties to protect Sesha since it was Yeon-woo\u2019s command.\u2018You don\u2019t feel anything out of the ordinary?\u2019\u300cActually, I looked around carefully after what you said.\u300d\u2018And?\u2019\u300cNada. It\u2019s verrrrry clean.\u300d\u2018\u2026Really?\u2019 Sesha thought that the news was just rumors then. It was likely there was no such thing as a mystery if Laplace hadn\u2019t been able to find anything either. Laplace always acted dumb in front of Sesha, but he was one of the eight beings who ruled over the Night. With all the otherworld gods bound to Yeon-woo, there was nothing in this world that could hide from his senses.\u300cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s strange.\u300dSesha felt like she was splashed with cold water at Laplace\u2019s next words. \u2018What? What do you mean? You said it\u2019s clean.\u2019\u300cHuhuhuhu. So innocent and naive. Like I said, it\u2019s clean\u2026 As if someone\u2019s cleaned it up intentionally.\u300d\u2018\u2026!\u2019\u300cIt\u2019s impossible for something to be that clean. Even if there aren\u2019t any dungeons, mana still flows everywhere, and peoples\u2019 vestiges remain. Do you think it makes sense that there\u2019s nothing left behind in a place where hundreds of students spend half of their lives?\u300d\u2018\u2026\u2019\u300cThe vestiges that humans release tend to clump together. The positive emotions like happiness and love combine, and the negative emotions like rage or depression combine. They all become a \u2018seed.\u2019 Of those, we eat the negative emotions.\u300dLaplace added.\u300cBefore the \u2018day of the beginning,\u2019 each school had similar yet different horror stories, didn\u2019t they? \u300d\u2018\u2026Yeah.\u2019\u300cThose were probably all real. The vestiges of students tend to be very intense. And considering the Korean education system\u2026 It\u2019s even more intense.\u300dSesha almost spent no time studying, so she couldn\u2019t relate, but there were definitely many flaws in South Korea\u2019s educational system. The gray concrete buildings, forced uniforms and strict rules, systems that made it difficult for students to be free\u2026 After-school study sessions that kept students at school until night. The college admissions process. Entrance exams. Studying. Stress.There were sometimes school violence cases that resulted from hierarchy among students. Strength and grades, or socioeconomic status, with ranks being divided according to these standards.It was fun hanging out with friends the same age, but that was a joy barely found beneath all the pressure. Everything else was dark and cold.The vestiges released in such an atmosphere couldn\u2019t be positive. Anxiety, confusion, depression, rage, fury, sadness\u2026 All these negative emotions combined to become a negative vestige. The heavier vestiges weren\u2019t able to ascend and continued to sink. They built up at the bottom and spread throughout entire schools. That was how school horror stories came to be. The resentment and anger students weren\u2019t able to release were projected onto their schools.\u300cWhat do you think of when you picture preschools or daycares? Happy and fun images. But what about school?\u300d\u2018The opposite.\u2019\u300cExactly. There are reasons why all these horror stories are made. The problem is that the stories don\u2019t just end as that, and when students start to believe they\u2019re real\u2026\u300d\u2018They become faiths?\u2019\u300cYes! That\u2019s it. Faiths start from a tiiiiiny place like that. Of course, most faiths like that quickly disappear, but if that faith continues to grow and becomes holy\u2026\u300dLaplace\u2019s voice trailed off and he giggled.Shivers ran down Sesha\u2019s back. It felt as if she had taken a peek into the wickedness inside of Laplace. Sesha\u2019s shadow transformed into a bunny that revealed its sharp and gruesome teeth.\u300cThe subject of the story will obtain an ego, and that\u2019s when they start acting out.\u300dFortunately, the bunny shadow that scared Sesha quickly returned to normal.\u2018But it doesn\u2019t make sense that it could hide from you.\u2019\u300cRight. That\u2019s the issue. Hmmm.\u300dLaplace thought for a moment.\u300cA newly born story\u2026 I mean, a monster is controlled by instinct rather than intellect. I would know even if it ran away after seeing it. It\u2019s impossible that it can hide its presence perfectly.\u300d\u2018So you\u2019re saying what\u2019s here might not be a horror story?\u2019\u300cThere are two possibilities. A monster made from someplace else might\u2019ve come here for the vestiges, or something could\u2019ve happened to a young monster that was made here\u2026\u300dLaplace\u2019s voice turned sharp.\u300cAnd it could\u2019ve evolved.\u300d\u2018Evolved? How?\u2019\u300cI don\u2019t know. I wouldn\u2019t know. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here to find out, isn\u2019t it?\u300dSesha nodded. Laplace was correct. She was here to confirm the news, so she needed to see for herself. A part of her was also relieved that she wasn\u2019t here at this time for nothing.However, it was impossible to know what this monster\u2019s purpose was. If there were some traces of the monster left behind, they could guess what it was, but there wasn\u2019t anything here, so it was difficult to prepare.\u300cHuhuhu. Still, don't worry. Even if it\u2019s a special guy, it won\u2019t be able to hurt you. You can just believe in this cute and adorable bunny.\u300d\u2018You mean weird and perverted bunny.\u2019\u300cHaa, haa, haa, haa! Again! Please say the same thing one more time in that cold voice!\u300d\u2018\u2026No.\u2019\u300cPleeeeease! Hm? Hm? Hmmmmm?\u300dSesha couldn\u2019t focus on the school because of the panting sounds in her ear. Her only thought was that she was going to ask her grandfather or dad to get rid of Laplace after this was over.Ding, ding, ding.\u00a0Just then, the bell signaling it struck midnight began to ring.\u00a0Click!\u00a0And\u2026the lights near the music room suddenly switched on.Sesha, Shin Sung-chan, and the rest of the staff who were filming turned in that direction.\u266c\u266a\u266a\u266cIt was very faint, but the sound of a piano could be heard. It was F\u00fcr Elise.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although Sesha had told her not to mind what she was doing, she noticed that Sesha was extremely focused on something.\u00a0Fwoosh!\u00a0A magic circle floated at her fingers and a fire was created.Min Chae-young subconsciously flinched at the fire, in case it would suddenly be directed at her. However, the orange flame continued to change from blue, white, yellow, black, and a bunch of other colors in Sesha\u2019s hands. It was so pretty that Chae-young unwittingly felt herself being pulled toward it.Belatedly, Min Chae-young caught her mistake and shook her head from side to side, turning back to looking at the window again. \u2018It\u2019s so uncomfortable.\u2019 Usually, this classroom was a space of her own at night, but a stranger had suddenly burst in. Naturally, she couldn\u2019t help but be curious about what they were doing. Her own personal time had disappeared.\u2018\u2026So uncomfortable.\u2019 When she was alive, Min Chae-young found it uncomfortable and difficult to speak to other people. Her biological mother blamed her poor fate on her daughter, and her stepfather looked at her with dirty eyes and beat her up on the nights he returned home drunk.Growing up in such a family environment, Min Chae-young was always hurt somewhere, and she didn\u2019t want to show others her injured face, so she began to stay away from people. When she realized she also wanted to hang out with friends, it was too late. She couldn\u2019t approach them first, as she didn\u2019t know how to make friends, and she was being bullied at school, so she didn\u2019t have the opportunity.From then, Min Chae-young started becoming scared just to have someone in the same space as her. No one knew when they might suddenly change and start to attack. The world was filled with fearful and harmful things she needed to avoid. Then, when she opened her eyes as a ghost, she was happy that she didn\u2019t have to live in fear anymore.Min Chae-young\u2019s classmates, stepfather, and biological mother\u2026were still all alive in this world. However, they couldn\u2019t recognize her presence any longer, nor could they interfere in her life. She was separated from the rest of the world like some isolated island.Some people might think it lonely\u2026but it tasted like freedom to Min Chae-young. At first, she skipped around everywhere in joy, and she even roamed around the school at night. But after some time, a certain thought occurred to her. She wanted to see someone: the boy who always greeted her early in the morning, the boy who continued to say hi even though she never said hi back\u2026\u2018A friend\u2026\u2019Yes. He was her friend\u2014at least, to Min Chae-young.\u2018Would he remember me?\u2019 Min Chae-young didn\u2019t know how much time had passed since then. As a ghost, her sense of time was a lot different from people who were alive now. It seemed a lot of time had passed from the point in time when she died to when she turned into a ghost though.The \u201cday of the beginning,\u201d magic, and skills, were all alien to her. So her friend had probably forgotten about her at this point too. Unlike her, he worked hard in school, so he probably graduated, started college, got a job, and he might even have kids.\u2018Or maybe he\u2019s a grandfather\u2026?\u2019Perhaps he didn\u2019t consider Min Chae-young a friend and put her in his past the moment he graduated. Whatever the case, it was almost impossible for him to find her. Even if he happened to want to visit his old high school, he would probably come in the day, but she woke up at night, so it was unlikely for them to meet. Even if she was lucky and they did meet, there was a chance he couldn\u2019t recognize her since she was a ghost.\u2018The most likely option is that I\u2019ll never see him again.\u2019 Min Chae-young didn\u2019t get her hopes high from the beginning. Still, there was a single reason why she continued to stay here waiting for him. \u2018\u2026Since it\u2019s a good memory.\u2019 Even if time passed and she wasn\u2019t able to maintain her ghost body, she wanted to cherish this memory forever.\u2018And if possible\u2026\u2019 A small part of Min Chae-young continued to hope despite thinking it was impossible. \u2018I want to tell him no matter what.\u2019 There were words she wanted to say to him but wasn\u2019t able to.So although Sesha\u2019s actions were a bit uncomfortable, she reminded Min Chae-young of that boy, so she didn\u2019t dislike her.* * *\u2018Wow\u2026 This is really hard.\u2019 Sesha sweated the entire time she was researching the spell Kronos taught her. She was born with enormous potential to sense and control mana because she was born with dragon blood, but this spell was trickier than she thought. \u2018He said this is ancient magic that the Nephilim used in the golden ages\u2026 This is really beyond imagination.\u2019The Nephilim were an ancient race born between the first members of Malach and L\u2019Infernal and humans, but they were known to have disappeared. Their massive size was reminiscent of giants, but they had wings on their backs.The magic they used was entirely different from the magic of the dragons, so it was difficult to pick it up. However, after she fumbled around with it a bit, she could use the spell \u2018Nephilim\u2019s Spark\u2019 somewhat.\u2018I did spend an entire fortnight working on this, after all.\u2019It had already been two weeks since Sesha came to visit Min Chae-young at night. At first, Min Chae-young didn\u2019t seem to care that much because she didn't think Sesha would give up soon, but she was starting to seem affected.\u2018Yesterday, she seemed a bit upset when I was later than normal.\u2019Min Chae-young seemed to think she was keeping a poker face, but Sesha could read all her expressions. It was amusing watching all her actions and faces. She was so pure that Sesha thought her soul couldn\u2019t be any clearer.Sesha didn\u2019t understand why such a person had gone through so much pain. \u2018If that had happened to me, I wouldn\u2019t have left anyone untouched.\u2019The show that was being filmed when she first met Min Chae-young was now being finished up. Producer Kim and the staff wondered why they had suddenly fainted in the middle of the night, but they didn\u2019t seem to think too much about it with Laplace\u2019s magic.\u2018That pervert bunny is still the same as ever too.\u2019Laplace was now best friends with the statues and dolls. He was busily dancing with them every night, and sometimes he seemed sad not to be able to stay at school longer.\u300eKyahaha! Correct! You have to flex exactly at this position for my biceps to be shown clearer, and it\u2019s very cute this way. You try it too! One, two, one, two! Can the lighting team turn the lights brighter, and the music team play the piano faster? All right, everyone get sprayed with pop!\u300fAlthough Laplace\u2019s parties were a bit strange\u2026 Sesha had no intention of ever participating. \u2018But it\u2019s a bit weird.\u2019 Then, a question suddenly occurred to her. \u2018The reason why Laplace wasn\u2019t able to discover the strange phenomenon\u2026 Is it really because of Chae-young?\u2019Laplace said there were traces of something having cleaned the vestiges up. If they had managed to hide from him, it meant their actions were secretive\u2026 To accomplish such a thing, whoever did it had to be quite powerful.Based on what Sesha observed of Min Chae-young, she wasn\u2019t someone to be able to do such a thing. The mysterious being behind all this needed to be at least a ghost with some divinity, but Min Chae-young couldn\u2019t even transform into a common poltergeist.\u2018Is there something about Chae-young that even she doesn\u2019t know about? Or\u2026!\u2019 Just when Sesha was about to speculate deeper, she jumped at the sudden voice.\u300cThis is magic?\u300dMin Chae-young was slightly bent over, looking at the Nephilim Spark in Sesha\u2019s hands. Sesha couldn\u2019t tell if it was because of the fire, but her face seemed red. Was it difficult for her to start a conversation after pretending not to notice her all this time? Chae-young had an expressionless face, but she seemed to be taking peeks at how Sesha was reacting.\u2018S-So cute!\u2019 Sesha had to contain her laughter that was threatening to come out. For some reason, Chae-young reminded her of her youngest aunt, Ye-eun, who was now about a hundred days old. She knew if she said that though, the door that had barely opened would be shut again. Sesha nodded without looking at Chae-young, so she wouldn\u2019t feel uncomfortable. \u201cYep, it is.\u201d\u300cAre you a magician?\u300d\u201cSomething similar.\u201dTo be exact, Sesha wasn\u2019t a magician but a member of a magical race.\u300cAre you good at it?\u300d\u201cProbably?\u201d\u300cBy how much?\u300d\u201cI\u2019m probably one of the strongest in the world?\u201d\u300c\u2026Don\u2019t lie. It\u2019s not good to lie.\u300dMin Chae-young scolded Sesha. She hated lying the most in the world because her mother and stepfather had always lied to her.However, Sesha cleared her throat and stood taller. \u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d\u300cWhat?\u300d\u201cDo you know what players are?\u201d\u300c\u2026No.\u300d\u201cThere are these things called players, although it\u2019s pretty much nonexistent now. I was always in the top ten among them.\u201d\u300c\u2026Really?\u300dChae-young seemed disbelieving.\u201cReally.\u201d Technically, since her family members were diving beings and not players, Sesha wasn\u2019t wrong. As if to prove her point, Sesha flicked her finger in the air, and the world around them changed. They were in a hot desert, a cold ice cap, and then on a sea that reflected the galaxy.\u300cWhoa\u2026!\u300dThe beautiful scenes Min Chae-young used to see on television swept right in front of her. She couldn\u2019t believe this was real. No, she didn\u2019t mind even if this was an illusion. It was magical just to be able to experience this.\u201cDo you believe me now?\u201d\u300cYeah\u2026!\u300dMin Chae-young nodded like a possessed person, then saw Sesha beaming at her and she quickly spun around. Her flushed face indicated she realized how intense her reaction had been. She seemed to be embarrassed. Then, as if she suddenly thought of something, Chae-young glanced at Sesha and muttered quietly.\u300c\u2026too?\u300d\u201cHm?\u201d\u300cCould I\u2026do this too?\u300dSesha grinned. \u201cOf course. I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d\u300c\u2026Really?\u300d\u201cYep.\u201d\u300cWhy\u2026?\u300dMin Chae-young wanted to ask why Sesha was being so nice when they barely knew each other.\u201cHm? Why?\u201d\u300cYou\u2026have no reason to help me\u2026\u300d\u201cWhy don\u2019t I have a reason? Is it strange to want to teach my friend something?\u201dMin Chae-young turned surprised.\u300cA friend\u2026?\u300d\u201cYeah. Aren\u2019t we friends? We have been together for two weeks.\u201dMin Chae-young\u2019s pupils began to shake. What? Friends? Were they? They\u2019d been together? Since when? Was she talking about how they were together in the same space for two weeks? Chae-young couldn\u2019t organize her thoughts because of the confusing information.Min Chae-young was so cute and innocent that Sesha couldn\u2019t stop smiling. \u2018Is she really a year older than me? Why is she so naive?\u2019 Min Chae-young would\u2019ve turned even redder if she knew what Sesha was thinking. Sesha grinned.\u300cT-Then\u2026!\u300d\u201cYeah. Go on.\u201d\u300cI-If I learn this, can I\u2026 Him?\u300d\u201cI didn\u2019t catch all of that. Can you repeat yourself?\u201d\u300cI-If I learn this\u2026 Can I find him?\u300dFinally, now that Min Chae-young has opened her heart, Sesha smiled warmly. \u201cWho do you want to find? Your first crush?\u201d\u300c\u2026N-Nothing like that!\u300dMin Chae-young\u2019s face was on the verge of exploding now.\u201cThen?\u201d\u300cA-A friend\u2026\u300dMin Chae-young fiddled her fingers. Her voice became smaller and was pitiful at this point. Sesha felt like she was becoming more like Park Yoo-min.\u201cAnd his name?\u201d\u300cSon\u2026!\u300dJust when Min Chae-young hesitantly spoke up, Laplace suddenly shouted and broke down the door to get into the classroom.\u300eLittle miss, get down!\u300fSesha instinctively grabbed Min Chae-young\u2019s hand and pulled her deeper inside the classroom, looking out the window.\u00a0Crash!\u00a0Bright yellow lightning was suddenly falling from the dark sky. To be exact, it was falling exactly on the school. It wasn\u2019t a natural phenomenon at all.\u300cAhhhhh!\u300dOh right, there\u2019s something you must beware of when meeting our ghost friend.What?There are two, in fact. First, they say she\u2019s scared of thunder and lightning.Min Chae-young shut her eyes tight and screamed. The lightning struck down the school building and broke the glass windows and walls. The desks were blown back by the aftershocks. It was a great impact that almost destroyed the building, but Sesha and Min Chae-young were fine thanks to the barrier Laplace created.However, Min Chae-young was trembling. Sesha soothed her while shooting a sharp glance outside the window. She could see a man with long black hair standing in front of Laplace. His skin was very pale, and his narrowed eyes were reminiscent of a scorpion\u2019s.\u201cFinally found you.\u201d The man\u2019s gaze was fixed on Min Chae-young. \u201cStar fragment.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She did not understand what the man meant. However, she was sure that the man was after Min Chae-young. The issue was that the energy emanating from the man was formidable.\u2018Who is that person\u2026?\u2019After Yeon-woo took away the system on Earth, the players who derived their powers from the system had to return to their normal lives.Though, it was said that many divine beings still observed Earth with interest since the Black King\u2019s true body, R\u2019lyeh, was assumed to still be on the planet. Even so, with Yeon-woo observing everything, there was no divine being that was foolish enough to invade Earth. Apart from that fact, Kronos and Rhea were also present on Earth. The two had regained their powers of their glory years.Moreover, if anything should happen on Earth, Olympus would also mobilize, so Earth was essentially a neutral zone, or to be more exact, a protected magic realm. It may be easy for one to step in, but if one made a mistake, even a creation god or great god would perish.However, such an existence had made an appearance on Earth. And this existence was a black-haired man, who obviously exuded great power.For Sesha, who had not yet achieved exuviation, the man\u2019s pressure was suffocating. If Laplace had not stepped in to protect her, she would have likely fallen into danger. Moreover, the man had approached her so stealthily that Yeon-woo did not seem to even \u2018notice\u2019. The same went for Laplace and Kronos. The distance from Sesha\u2019s school to her home was quite a bit, but for Kronos, that should not have been much of a problem.Thus, Sesha knew. \u2018It\u2019s that man. The one who erased the vestiges at my school.\u2019It was clear that this man had deceived Laplace\u2019s senses.Shake.\u00a0And Min Chae-young, whom Sesha held in her arms, kept trembling like a baby bird shivering in the cold. What had happened to Chae-young on the day the thunder and lightning struck to make her react this way?However, without caring about Min Chae-young\u2019s reaction, the man reached out with his hand. He did not care that Sesha and Laplace were in his way.\u00a0Bam!\u00a0Just before a light started shining from the man\u2019s fingertips, Laplace grabbed the man\u2019s wrist with his large hand.The man quietly turned his gaze to Laplace. He glanced at his wrist and at Laplace while narrowing his eyes. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\u300eOhoho. You\u2019re asking the very question I want to ask you.\u300fSss.\u00a0Laplace was smiling, but Sesha knew that Laplace had gotten angry. Laplace\u2019s rabbit shadow had widened its mouth. The serrated teeth of Laplace\u2019s shadow could easily be seen.\u300eWho the hell are you to attack our cute little Sesha? Are you going to answer, you ugly man?\u300f\u201cI am the collector.\u201d The man\u2019s voice was calm. \u201cA person who collects fragments.\u201d\u300eHmpf! There\u2019re crazy people everywhere.\u300fAs soon as Laplace finished speaking\u2026\u00a0Rumble!\u00a0Laplace\u2019s shadow extended its black tentacles and swept a strong gale towards the man. The wind was like an interstellar wind that blew between the stars in the deep universe. The light contained within it was like the starlight embedded in the night sky.However, contrary to its beautiful appearance, the result of the collision was anything but beautiful. A powerful shockwave blew up the classroom in an instant.\u201cChae-young, run!\u201d Sesha knew what she had to do. She grabbed Min Chae-young\u2019s hand and dragged her down the hallway.Boom! Boom! Boom! Bam! Bam!\u00a0The clash between Laplace and the man shook the entire school. It seemed as if the school would collapse at any moment. A row of windows in the hallway shattered and broke one after another. The classroom door was swept away by the strong wind and smashed the window on the opposite-side of the classroom\u2019s hallway. As a result, pieces of desks and stools became deadly weapons as they started flying all over the place. The classroom\u2019s walls collapsed, and pieces of the ceiling started falling. It was as if a violent earthquake had wreaked havoc on the site.In addition, with strong winds constantly blowing out, Sesha found it difficult to run while holding onto Chae-young. However, Sesha knew that this level of wind and destruction was already lessened as a consideration for their safety.Originally, beings like Laplace and the man would not have cared about the school and would have blown it into pieces without a second thought. If they truly fought, a large part of Earth itself would have been destroyed.Of course, if that happened, Sesha and Min Chae-young would have disappeared without leaving a trace.Hence, Laplace was controlling his power level. One part of his power was used against the man while another was being used to protect Sesha and the others. Laplace did this because his mission was to protect Sesha.However, there was something that Sesha could not understand. Even if Laplace was dividing his power, he was still one of the Eight Gods of Disorder. However, Laplace was not able to easily kill the man. What the hell was the man\u2019s identity\u2026? Sesha was unable to continue with her train of thought for long.Rattle! Rattle!\u00a0The skeleton model in the hallway was waving its hand urgently and shouting something. At the same time, some statues were rushing towards this place.\u2018What\u2026?!\u2019 Sesha anxiously turned her head back.Sss.\u00a0Through the shattered and scattered rubble, Sesha saw two shadows quickly approaching her. She realized intuitively that they were not Laplace\u2019s shadows. Additionally, they were not the man\u2019s\u2026 They were separate beings.Thinking that she would be overtaken at this rate, Sesha tried to untie the Lotus Sword that was wrapped around her wrist. However, the statue of Yi Sun-sin and a stone statue of King Sejong quickly caught up to Sesha. For a brief moment, the two statues\u2019 eyes met Sesha\u2019s.\u201cYou guys\u2026!\u201d Sesha was able to hear the two\u2019s voices.\u2018Run away.\u2019\u2018We\u2019ll try to run interference.\u2019Sesha wanted to say that they would not be able to stop the man. No matter how mysterious an origin the two possessed, they were not divine beings. They were just monster existences that would be no match against the man.However, the Yi Sun-sin statue seemed to state that it was fine. It smiled brightly and pulled its sword out of its sheath. It was a mere stone sword, but for some mysterious reason, Sesha felt that the sword was swarmed in light.The Ruler\u2019s Heavenly Oath. Moving Mountains and Rivers.Clearing with One Move. Dyeing the Mountains and Rivers with Blood.The phrases written on the sword came into Sesha\u2019s eyes.\u201cI swear by this stone sword that the mountains and rivers shall tremble, and with one swing, I shall defeat my enemy and dye the mountains and rivers in blood!\u201dThe statue of Yi Sun-sin smashed the ground with his long sword.\u00a0Boom! Rumble\u2026\u00a0The explosion shook the school building once more.While Yi Sun-sin\u2019s statue was taking this action, the stone statue of King Sejong seemed to say \u2018Don\u2019t worry\u2019 as it winked. King Sejong\u2019s statue supported the statue of Yi Sun-sin, and subsequently, the many skeleton models and various lesser statues started piling up and creating an artificial wall.\u2018\u2026damn it!\u2019 Sesha clenched her jaw. She felt a scorching heat pierce the tip of his nose, and it was soon accompanied by a pungent smoke. The two statues had tried their best, but in the end, they were not able to hold out for long.\u300cNo\u2026!\u300d Min Chae-young clenched her jaw as she looked at the scene. The death of her friends, who she had befriended and wandered the hallway with together, awakened the consciousness she had been unable to regain due to her traumatic experience. She had not even had the opportunity to have a proper conversation with them. She would not be able to even thank them\u2026 Although being locked up in the classroom, the two statue existences had given their lives for her.\u300eIt\u2019s annoying that you\u2019re constantly running away.\u300fAt that time, Sesha and Min Chae-young abruptly stopped in the middle of the stairway as a shadow popped up in front of them. One of the two shadows that was chasing after them had just caught up with them. As the shadow lifted, a middle-aged man with red hair was revealed.\u300eHahaha. You have nowhere to go now.\u300fFrom behind, the second shadow arrived and lifted its veil. It turned into a woman with an alluring smile.\u201cChild.\u201d The woman spoke aloud like a human, and she gave a human-like smile. However, Sesha did not miss the chilling killing intent hidden in the woman\u2019s playful eyes. The woman spoke, \u201cGive me what you have in your hand. If you do that, I\u2019ll let you go. You\u2019re not our target in the first place.\u201d\u201cWe have no intention of making a fuss. You don\u2019t need to care for such a cumbersome and disturbing child, right? It\u2019s not even a living person.\u201dThe woman nodded after the middle-aged man spoke.Min Chae-young\u2019s gaze trembled. If she was in Sesha\u2019s shoes, she knew that she would choose to give her up. However\u2026\u00a0Whoosh!\u00a0Sesha untied her Lotus Sword from her wrist.The roughly two-and-a-half-meter Lotus Sword extended itself across the ground as Sesha firmly gripped its handle. With her other hand, Sesha held firmly onto Min Chae-young\u2019s hand. \u201cI won\u2019t leave you. I\u2019ll protect you somehow.\u201d\u300cBut\u2026!\u300d\u201cI\u2019ve already made up my mind. Don\u2019t say anything else.\u201dWhoosh!\u00a0A magic circle formed under Sesha\u2019s feet and shot up white flames that wrapped around her before clinging to her Lotus Sword. The flames were the \u2018Nephilim\u2019s Fire\u2019, a skill that she recently started learning from Kronos.\u2018I don\u2019t know if this\u2019ll work, but\u2026!\u2019It was Sesha\u2019s first time using the skill outside of practice, so she was not sure she could properly pull off the skill. However, in order to contend with the divine beings in front of her, she had to use the most effective magic skill she knew, and no matter how much she thought, this skill was the only thing that came to her mind.\u2018If I had known this would happen, I would have paid closer attention and learned it properly when grandfather tried to teach me\u2026!\u2019Sesha regretted neglecting to learn magic for the past year or so. She had thought that Earth would be relatively safe. Of course, even if she had trained properly, she probably would still be no match for the foes in front of her or reach exuviation from her training. However, at this moment, Sesha wanted whatever help she could get.\u201cSo, you\u2019re going to fight even though you don\u2019t have to.\u201d The middle-aged man smiled coldly. \u201cIf that\u2019s your wish, I will grant what you seek, foolish child.\u201dIn an instant, the world surrounding the middle-aged man changed. Sesha and Min Chae-young were also sucked into the middle-aged man\u2019s space.\u00a0Whoosh!\u00a0It was a world full of darkness. Not a single point of light could be seen.Sesha\u2019s expression hardened. She noticed that this was the man\u2019s illusory world, his holy territory.\u201cThis place again? Ugh. It\u2019s so dark and gloomy here. Can\u2019t you try to change it and make something else?\u201d The woman seemed to be very familiar with this place. She grumbled and complained as if she was sick of the space. Yet, a corner of her mouth rose, expressing her cruel thoughts and intentions.***Darkness Sphere was a place completely isolated from the outside, so whatever happened within could not be observed from outside. Sesha recognized that she was in a holy territory, but in fact, this space was slightly different from a normal holy territory.This holy territory was a Star Field. The starlight here shined brighter than starlight from anywhere else. Therefore, fighting outside the Star Field was burdensome for these two existences.As for Earth\u2026 If Earth was exposed to this starlight, it would melt away. Although Earth\u2019s solar system\u2019s sun was not the largest of all stars, if one got too close, the sun would eventually melt whatever came near, even a planet like Earth.However, there was no need to worry about that in the Star Field. Moreover, the two would not have to worry about the king of gods couple finding them.The middle-aged man, also known as the Southern Arrow, or Sagitta, smiled broadly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was known as a place where \u2018heroes\u2019 all over the universe entered to test their mettle. Each floor of the Tower had its own set of trials and difficulties under various scenario themes, and if one was able to rise through all ninety-nine floors, one could become a \u2018true\u2019 god.As someone who detested gods, Vivasvat felt that the Tower was a nonsensical concept, so he deliberately ignored anything to do with it. However, he had just received an invitation to enter. Of course, Vivasvat\u2019s answer was obvious.[Rejected.]\u2018I don\u2019t know who created such a useless thing, but if I find out who it is later, I\u2019ll have to give him or her a beat down.\u2019 If this kind of nonsense pathway for mortals continued, Vivasvat felt that something bad could happen in the future.While he was having these thoughts\u2026\u00a0Whoosh!\u00a0Vivasvat moved to the next place of interest in search of the Heavenly Demon.***[You have entered \u2018Planet Full of Nightmares\u2019!]\u2018\u2026the stench is overpowering.\u2019 Vivasvat squinted as soon as he crossed the portal. The stench that assaulted his nose made him nauseous. At times like this, Vivasvat did not appreciate his sensitive senses. The layout of the planet beneath his feet was filled with nothing but charred trees.\u2018Is there really an elder god in a place like this?\u2019 The reason Vivasvat chose to visit this planet was because traces of an existence that helped the Heavenly Demon create the universe were found here. \u2018I\u2019ve heard this elder god cares so much about mortals, as seen by his active service in assisting the Heavenly Demon create the laws and life of the world\u2026 But looking at this place, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.\u2019As he traveled around the universe and killed gods one after another, Vivasvat realized that the gods did not particularly care about the past. Though these elder gods constantly expounded on their good deeds and intentions in the past, they were only kidding themselves as they immersed and saw themselves based solely on their \u2018past\u2019. The noble ideals and splendid hopes they had in the past were all buried under the grab for power in the present.This planet illustrated that point. Vivasvat was half expecting a dignified presence on the planet, as it was essentially being ruled over by a creator god, but everything on the planet was so messed up that it seemed no better than hell. Along the entire surface of the planet, barren and withered trees, like thorns on a hedgehog, dotted the landscape, and from many of the trees, people could be seen hanging from them, wrapped in vines. The vine\u2019s spiky thorns dug deep into the humans\u2019 skins and sucked their bodily fluids. It looked unbearably painful.However, unlike how ghastly it looked externally, the people on the vine all had grinning expressions. A narcotic hormone seemed to be pumping into them through the thorns, allowing them to forget their physical pains. Seemingly having been under this parasitic state for a long time, the people seemed to have lost all ability to reason. Once the useful life of one human was depleted, the vine system probably just cast away the useless human like trash and seek a new prey.Vivasvat had seen this type of tree, Tree of the Dead, several times during his travels. The Tree of Death was used to capture mortals, forcibly make them feel happy and satisfied, and extract the faith that flowed out from them. Vivasvat knew that many of these \u2018fallen\u2019 gods would often take over a planet, privatize it for their own benefit, and mine mortals and their faith\u2026 \u00a0But he never thought an elder god would fall to such a low tactic.\u2018No. Rather, it may be that this is the norm. It\u2019s because of their illogic and nastiness that such an unfair universe was created.\u2019 Vivasvat\u2019s eyes twinkled coldly. \u2018I should get rid of him quickly.\u2019Vivasvat raised his magic power and gathered it in the center of his palm.[\u2018Great Handprint\u2019 explodes!]Using the martial art skill that he developed after visiting the One-horned Tribe, Vivasvat flicked his palm forward. Once he did so, a magic field expanded from his palm. It expanded hundreds of thousands of times and landed at the center of the planet\u2019s surface. It landed in the middle of the thickest part of the Tree of the Dead.Boom! Rumble. Rumble. Rumble\u2026\u00a0The skill that Vivasvat exhibited surpassed the level that a mere mortal could accomplish. A pit of immense depth was created in the place where the Great Handprint exploded, as if a meteorite with a diameter of several kilometers had crashed onto the surface. As a result, the surrounding landmass soared up more than tens of kilometers around the newly formed crater. Moreover, the earth that once made up the crater flew high up into the air.Making a parabolic shape, the earth spread out over a large range. The fallout was so widespread that it could be clearly seen from above the planet. Moreover, due to the sudden tectonic movement, the mantle flowing under the planet\u2019s surface reacted in unison and affected the entire planet\u2026 Cracks started spreading on the surface, and red lava began to shoot up at random. A black plume blanketed the entire surface of the planet in an instant, and a huge typhoon swept away all that remained on the planet\u2019s surface. It was such a catastrophe that one could not help but doubt if any living being could survive the aftermath.[The \u2018Planet Full of Nightmares\u2019 has met an apocalyptic end!][A shrouding, fiery wind engulfs the planet.][A fire sweeps through and shrouds the planet.] ...[Executor of the Apocalypse: Vivasvat][Your level of evil has risen dramatically!]Though he saw the messages appearing in his mind, Vivasvat did not blink. Since he had caused an immeasurable amount of death, the achievements accumulated in Vivasvat\u2019s soul were stained with evil. However, Vivasvat did not mind this penalty, as he felt this was the only way to clear away the evil doings of the gods.No, Vivasvat was sure that he was making the right choice. If he did not take this action, the souls of the enslaved mortal humans would belong to the gods even after the mortals died, so they would have to live a life of pain and imprisonment for eternity.\u300cThank you\u2026\u300d\u300cThank you for freeing us from the never-ending cycle of bondage and suffering\u2026\u300d\u300cNow, my people, my children\u2026\u300d\u300cMy parents will now be able to close their eyes in peace\u2026\u300dThese were the voices that reverberated around Vivasvat.[An innumerable amount of faith is being gathered!][Your spirit and soul are responding.][The evil achievements you acquired are being washed away.]\u2026[Your exuviation and transcendence, which was interrupted, shall resume.][Your light distribution shines out!]\u2026[You have forcibly canceled your exuviation and transcendence.]Vivasvat clenched his teeth and suppressed the light distribution emanating from his body. If he left the process alone, he would become a god, the same existence that he detested and fought against. However, his ability to forcibly stop the process was slowly reaching its limit. \u2018I don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold it back.\u2019In a situation where even the death of a god would be a tremendous achievement, the faith gained by saving the numerous beings detained by such an evil god would be enormous. Even at this moment, Vivasvat\u2019s powers were rapidly growing. He was beginning to hit his \u2018limit\u2019 in holding back the exuviation and transcendence process.Vivasvat thought that he would have to find a new way to forcibly stop his development into a god. While he was having this thought, something started to wriggle in the middle of the wasted planet\u2019s surface.[An ancient being who had been sleeping is awakening!]The evil, dark existence that had been secretly hidden in the inner core of the planet squirmed and then lifted his head upward. The being had eyes as cold as a snake as it had just awakened from a long hibernation.Who. Dares. Disturb. My. Sleep.Having been asleep for a long time, the being did not seem to be able to properly assess the situation, so it started speaking whatever gibberish came to its mind.Although the amount of information the being was emanating was enormous enough to paralyze any mortal, Vivasvat was largely unaffected and could roughly understand what the being was saying.The being\u2019s words made Vivasvat angrier. The being had no guilt about the sins he had committed. Rather, the being was angered at being woken up. Vivasvat muttered, \u201cI shall tear you apart and bring your death.\u201d[Your light distribution shines brilliantly!]Boom!\u00a0Vivasvat flew at the elder god, emitting a more splendid light than any sun.***\u300eThe Heavenly Demon\u2026 How could he do this to me?!\u300fThe elder god stated his divine name, The One Who Always Sleeps. However, Vivasvat did not care about the elder god\u2019s name. \u2018Is this guy really an elder god? Nonsense.\u2019According to what Vivasvat had heard so far in passing, all the elder gods were supposedly great beings. They were beings that existed before the present universe was even created, and they reigned with the Heavenly Demons based on their omnipotent powers.However, although many of these elder god\u2019s legends disappeared and melted into the laws of the world as the eons passed without the outward appearance of their existence, those beings who remembered these elder gods still considered them as \u2018great\u2019 beings.Even if some of the descriptions and achievements were exaggerated and a bit overblown, Vivasvat still thought it would be a challenge to confront the elder gods. However, in reality, Vivasvat dominated the confrontations one-sidedly.The powers the elder gods possessed were obviously great, but they were all just remnant traces of their past states. The elder gods\u2019 powers had been eroded to the point that it was nearly impossible for Vivasvat to feel any divinity stemming from them.To be precise, it was not an exaggeration to say that the elder gods were barely able to sustain their life by sucking up the nutrients of the planet they latched on to.\u2018No. To be precise, they\u2019re only a shell of their previous selves.\u2019It was as if their being had been thoroughly worn out, leaving behind only an empty husk of their former selves.\u300eThroughout the countless cycles of the \u2018wheel\u2019, though I lost my powers with each successive iteration, I still chose to serve you, Heavenly Demon\u2026! Heavenly Demon, why have you forsaken me! Are you planning to cast me away after using me as your faithful hound? How are you different from my foolish father, the Black King!\u300f\u2018Wheel? Lost powers? A hound? And what or who is this foolish father?\u2019 Vivasvat could not understand all the words of the being who cried out as he looked up at the sky, but Vivasvat could tell that the being\u2019s words had something to do with the \u2018secret\u2019 surrounding the creation of the universe. It seemed that this location would prove to be fruitful for Vivasvat. \u2018I think he sees me as a messenger sent by my father, so I might be able to figure something out if I slap him around a little.\u2019Fortunately or unfortunately, many of the powers that Vivasvat possessed resembled those of the Heavenly Demon.\u201cIt won\u2019t change anything to lament like that. You fled and veered away from the great will that founded the light of creation. Are those words the last things you want to leave behind?\u201dThe being, who had the head of a snake, quickly turned his head and glared at Vivasvat.\u300eYou\u2026 You\u2019re saying that I violated the will of the Heavenly Demon?\u300f\u201cHaven\u2019t you? Did he tell you to stay here and exploit innocent mortals?\u201d\u300eI have been wronged! Though I did not follow the Heavenly Demon\u2019s suggestions and ran away from him, I still tried not to interfere with the \u2018wheel\u2019 and live a quiet life! Even though I\u2019ve done this\u2026!\u300f\u2018Suggestion?\u2019 Vivasvat felt that he was on the cusp of understanding something. He spoke up again, \u201cYou should have known that the will of the creation light was not to live as you have, no?\u201d\u300eWill you only be satisfied once you\u2019ve used us until the end! Did you think I didn\u2019t notice that you\u2019ve corralled all of us together in this small place to take advantage of us?\u300f\u2018Corralled together\u2026\u2019 Vivasvat felt he had caught something important. \u201cIs that wrong?\u201d\u300eOf course it\u2019s wrong\u2026!\u300f The being stopped screaming, as if he realized something, and started narrowing his eyes.\u300eYou\u2026! You don\u2019t know anything! I thought you were another face of the Heavenly Demon, but you\u2019re not. You\u2019re like him, but also very different\u2026 Who the hell are you?\u300f\u2018Damn. Did he find out?\u2019 Vivasvat was a little disappointed, as he felt he was just about to gain the information that he wanted. If he could find out what the \u2018corralled area\u2019 the being was talking about was, Vivasvat felt he would be one step closer in finding the whereabouts of the Heavenly Demon. \u2018I could have also found out what the secret is about the creation of the universe.\u2019Whoosh![Fully releasing your powers.][Your light distribution is flowing outward!]Vivasvat, after releasing his powers, struck down on the being.Thud\u2026!\u300eArgh\u2026!\u300f\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know who I am. I want you to tell me what the Heavenly Demon\u2019s instructions were.\u201d\u300eI\u2026 I\u2026!\u300f\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re trying to buy some time to come up with a plausible excuse, but you better think against taking that type of action. I can tear you apart instantly if I want.\u201dVivasvat\u2019s light distribution suddenly covered his entire body, and Vivasvat\u2019s face was no longer visible. Moreover, Vivasvat\u2019s voice gradually became blunt, as if he had lost all his human emotions.\u201cOf course, even if you die here, if you have some faith stored away, you\u2019ll probably be able to resurrect after a long time. But, I promise, when that time comes, I will be the first to find you and kill you again. I will make sure that all your legends and faith are completely depleted. Once you die a few more times, your existence will disappear completely.\u201d\u300eDamn\u2026it!\u300f Having heard Vivasvat\u2019s words, the elder god could no longer resist. Eventually, the elder god raised his head and tried to tell the secret that Vivasvat was curious about. Until the end, the elder god never gave up hope that he might be able to live.Vivasvat\u2019s eyes twinkled at the thought that his dreadful pursuit of the Heavenly Demon might finally be over. However, his hopes were soon squashed.Black clouds gathered in the middle of the universe, where there was once nothing, and a golden thunderbolt shot out.\u00a0Rumble!\u00a0Without being able to make any move, Vivasvat could only watch helplessly as a golden thunderbolt smashed onto the planet, mercilessly crushing the being\u2019s snake-like head.Sss.\u00a0The fragments of the being\u2019s head, which exploded like pieces of sand from an exploding sandcastle, gathered onto the spot where the lightning bolt struck.[\u2018The One Who Always Sleeps\u2019 has been god sealed!]The god wasn\u2019t killed, just sealed. Vivasvat, well aware of what this meant, had no choice but to react with fury. \u2018God sealing\u2019 rather than \u2018god killing\u2019 meant that the existence was completely annihilated from the present universe. Only an absolute being could achieve this feat. The god sealing also required a unique material called divine iron. At present, even Vivasvat was not able to accomplish god sealing.In the present universe, there was only one type of being capable of this feat\u2014the faces of the Heavenly Demon. The incarnations and different faces of the Heavenly Demon, who were born from the great will of the creation light, appeared in different iterations of the universe.[Sun Wukong is descending!]Among these different incarnations and faces of the Heavenly Demon, the Great Sage, said to be one of the strongest beings, was making his appearance.\u201cWow, this guy. You sure have a face that I\u2019d like to punch a few times.\u201dWhoosh! Bam!Sun Wukong tilted his head as he looked over the thing that looked like the Ruyi Bang. \u201cAre you Jiho\u2019s son?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What\u2019s that?\u201d Sesha tilted her head because it was her first time hearing about such a thing.Everything related to the system was retrieved after Yeon-woo awoke, and all the dungeons and gates closed. Most mysterious and magical phenomena in the world had disappeared. Even if there were some remnants left, it was only the trivial objects, and they were currently being used for science. A \u201cmystery\u201d in present-day was most likely just another remnant.\u2018But there wasn\u2019t anything like that.\u2019 If there was a remnant at school, Sesha would\u2019ve noticed by now. She was born with dragon blood, and her perception of magic was far above everyone else\u2019s. Even with the system retrieved, Sesha would still use magic. Unlike the other players, who only used skills given by the system, she had learned how to control it from Ananta.Park Yoo-min nodded and moved closer to Sesha, whispering as if she was sharing a secret only for her ears. \u201cYup. You know the statue of King Sejong in the schoolyard?\u201d\u201cThe one in the middle?\u201d\u201cYeah. When the clock strikes midnight, apparently it starts moving.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dSesha blinked. The statue of King Sejong was something she was familiar with as well. Along with the statue of Yi Sun-sin, it was a statue that could be seen commonly at most schools. Beneath the stone statue where King Sejong was sitting with dignity was the Korean alphabet. But Sesha could guarantee the statue was just an ordinary factory-made object. There were no traces of magic to be found on it.\u201cAnd around that time, sounds of soft piano playing can be heard from the music room, and the lights of the seniors\u2019 classrooms on the third floor light up, and strange shadows\u2014\u201d\u201cHey.\u201d Sesha cut Yoo-min with a scowl. \u201cHow old are you again? Huh?\u201dYoo-min seemed to be describing a scene from a movie that came out when they were younger. Scary stories about schools were popular back then too, so Sesha remembered them very clearly.Park Yoo-min sighed. \u201cDarn it, you didn\u2019t fall for it\u2026\u201d\u201cPeople who fall for that are probably idiots.\u201d\u201cRight? But seriously, I know I sound ridiculous, but I\u2019m not lying.\u201d\u201cStop pulling my leg.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m being serious!\u201d Park Yoo-min wagged her index finger. \u201cThere are real eyewitnesses. Even in our class.\u201dSesha\u2019s unbelieving face turned into one of interest. \u201cEyewitnesses\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah. Our class president said she was going home after an after-school study session and then came back to school after remembering she forgot one of her books.\u201d\u201cOof.\u201d Sesha glanced to her side with a face that screamed \u201cyikes.\u201d At the end of her gaze was a glass-wearing girl solving math problems in the corner of the classroom. The girl always studied even when everyone else was chatting and playing around during their break time\u2026 She was truly amazing. Sesha could never do that, but that was probably because her grades were surprisingly good considering how much effort she put (or in this case, didn\u2019t put) into her studies.\u201cAnd when she returned, it was around midnight, and the lights were all off.\u201d\u201cShe has guts\u2026\u201d\u201cExactly. Anyway, she was going to her class when she suddenly started to hear piano sounds. F\u00fcr Elise or something like that.\u201d\u201cMaybe someone left their phone behind and that\u2019s where it was coming from?\u201d\u201cMaybe. But then the lights in another classroom suddenly switched on, and she saw shadows moving. Then she ran away because she was scared.\u201d\u201cMaybe it was just a thief?\u201d\u201cYou know how our class president is, sharp as a tack. So that\u2019s what she thought too at first, and she called the police the next day to check.\u201d\u201cWhen?\u201d\u201cThat day you were absent because you were at a photoshoot or something.\u201d\u201cOh, that day? And what was the result?\u201d\u201cNothing was stolen. And the classroom where the lights were turned on was closed with a lock, and there wasn\u2019t any indication of it being broken into.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s a bit strange. I hope it\u2019s not a pervert.\u201d\u201cApparently that wasn\u2019t it either.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s more?\u201dPark Yoo-min nodded and began to gush about what she\u2019d heard. A student-athlete who\u2019d been going home late from training, a neighborhood resident who\u2019d been walking her dog near the schoolyard, and even a teacher who had late night duties. It was strange that the rumors weren\u2019t further spread at this point.\u2018Is there a ghost or something?\u2019 Sesha tilted her head and heightened her senses, but she still didn\u2019t feel anything. Ghosts, spirits, phantoms\u2026 Nothing. There just wasn\u2019t anything at this school that was related to mana in general. \u201c\u2026How do you know all that?\u201d\u201cHeehee. It\u2019s interesting.\u201d\u201cYou should try studying with that passion.\u201d\u201cShut up. I\u2019m going my own way.\u201dSesha shook her head and became deep in thought for a moment. \u2018Should I go and check it later?\u2019 If there really was something left behind that she hadn\u2019t been able to sense, and if it was a remnant of a dungeon that Yeon-woo hadn\u2019t retrieved, it could end up being dangerous in the future.\u2018What should I do?\u2019 Sesha contemplated returning later alone in the evening. If she got a bad feeling about it, she could always call her family. She could probably take care of it herself, but if there really was a mystery, it could be dangerous since it was strong enough to go undetected by her senses.Of course, no matter how great the danger, Kronos would be able to take care of it with just a wave of one hand.\u2018But I can\u2019t request something from Mom and Grandpa with something that hasn\u2019t been confirmed.\u2019 Sesha needed to find out what the mystery was first. \u2018Ugh, what a bother.\u2019Sesha shivered at the thought of having to return to school so late, then remembered why they were on this subject. \u201cOh right, so they\u2019re gonna film experiencing this mystery for the show?\u201d\u201cYeah. It seems like the kids who are fans of Sung-chan are going to stay behind until then.\u201d\u201c\u2026They\u2019re probably going to be slapped on their backs by their moms.\u201dPark Yoo-min smiled mischievously at Sesha, who seemed contemplative. \u201cWhy? You\u2019re interested?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be dangerous if there really are monsters left.\u201d\u201cOoh! Idol.\u201d\u201c\u2026Can you please stop calling me that weird name?\u201d\u201cOoh! Hero of justice.\u201d\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have even tried\u2026\u201d\u201cIf the mystery is a monster, we\u2019ll be able to see the black dragon that\u2019s asleep in your arm, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026There\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d\u201cReally? They said on your fandom forum that \u2018our goddess is hiding wings beneath her clothes\u2019 and\u2014\u201d\u201cI said to stop!\u201d Sesha shouted because she felt like Yoo-min would continue to say weird things at this rate. But that didn\u2019t deter Yoo-min from teasing her.* * *Producer Kim brightened upon receiving good news from the scriptwriter. \u201cReally? Is that true?\u201d\u201cYup!\u201d\u201cWhew! Looks like everything\u2019s going smoothly from here!\u201dAll the staff members looked to Producer Kim after his loud reaction. They wondered why he was being so dramatic this time.Just then, Producer Kim burst up and walked toward Shin Sung-chan, who was getting his makeup retouched by his stylist.Shin Sung-chan looked at Producer Kim through the mirror when the producer suddenly grasped his hands.\u201cHey, Shin. Is there anything you want to eat later? You\u2019re not allowed to eat properly because your comeback date is coming close, right? Just give me the word, and I\u2019ll order you food when your manager isn\u2019t looking.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026You should say that when my manager is gone\u2026\u201dManager Kim Hyung-eun glared at Shin Sung-chan with crossed arms from far away.\u201cBut did something good happen?\u201d\u201cKya! I didn\u2019t know our Shin was so proactive with this show! Sorry for not realizing your genuineness earlier.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d Shin Sung-chan still looked confused, not understanding what Producer Kim was saying.Now, it was Producer Kim\u2019s turn to look confused. \u201cHm? It wasn\u2019t you who got the Idol to participate in our filming?\u201d\u201cSo-yeong is\u2026?\u201d Shin Sung-chan looked dumbfounded at the unexpected news, but he quickly cleared his throat and responded with composure when he spotted his manager glaring at him through the mirror. \u201cAhem, I just asked if she could help with our show. But I told her it was fine since she looked a bit uncomfortable\u2026 Haha. I guess So-yeong heeded my request without me knowing. It would\u2019ve been nice if she texted me about it, haha.\u201d\u201cShe probably wanted to surprise you. Very good, very good! You brought the Idol\u2026! Whew! Our Shin is so capable, huh?\u201d Producer Kim patted Shin Sung-chan\u2019s shoulders while he nodded. The stylist glared at him because the makeup brush missed its mark with every pat, but the producer didn\u2019t seem to notice. He was too overjoyed. It was harder than pulling a star down from the sky to cast the Idol in a show, but Shin Sung-chan had done it.The staff became much busier. Sesha\u2019s popularity was beyond comparison to Shin Sung-chan\u2019s. She was a star of stars who was famous globally. They had to give her their best treatment. The script writers also quickly revised the script while the cameramen called headquarters to request more staff. Shin Sung-chan\u2019s agency heard the news and said they would send more people as well.If this filming went well, Shin Sung-chan and his group\u2019s popularity and reputation would soar. Producer Kim and the rest of the staff, who were in charge of this show, would be able to add a spectacular project to their job experiences.However, Shin Sung-chan, who was at the center of it all, looked far from excited. \u2018So-yeong\u2026\u2019 The same thought repeated in his head over and over again. \u2018So-yeong is coming\u2026! To see me!\u2019Cherubs blew trumpets in Sung-chan\u2019s mind. In his imagination, he was already married to Sesha and had two children with her, and they were living close to his in-laws. But of course, it was all in his head. The greater the delusion, the greater the shock would be when it was broken.* * *Mom, go ahead and eat first. I think something similar to a dungeon appeared at the school.\u00a0Sesha was writing a message for her mom. She needed to tell her mom that she\u2019d be late today. However, she wasn\u2019t able to press the send button.Mom, go ahead and eat first. I think something similar to a dungeon appeared at the school. Also\u2026\u00a0Sesha typed an extra four letters. \u201cAlso.\u201d After biting her lip for a while, she pressed a few more letters.\u00a0Also, I\u2019m sorry about\u2026All Seshe had to write was \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d or \u201cI apologize.\u201d Why was it so hard? The prideful seventeen-year-old adolescent had difficulty being truthful to her mom. In the end, Sesha erased everything from the \u201calso\u201d and pressed send. For the next few moments, Sesha glared at her phone. After a while, the \u201cread\u201d appeared and Ananta\u2019s response arrived.Ding!Do you need me?After some deliberation, Sesha pressed the keys again.\u00a0I\u2019m fine.Okay. Don\u2019t worry about me, and take it easy. Eat something too. You know safety is more important, right? I love you.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201d After the conversation via messages was over, Sesha put her phone down and sighed. The last words echoed in her head.\u00a0I love you.\u00a0Her mom was worried about her instead of scolding her for this morning\u2019s actions, but why couldn\u2019t she apologize?\u201c\u2026I\u2019m so stupid.\u201d Sesha kicked the innocent floor again and again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When she heard about their story of a lover who waited for Yeon-woo until the very end\u2026Sesha had mixed feelings. Would she ever be able to find such a person? She found it difficult to ask that question. She herself agreed that she was a very prideful person, so she couldn\u2019t imagine ever waiting for someone that long.Based on how similar Yeon-woo\u2019s and her personalities were\u2026love could be something that was only attainable through killing one\u2019s self. Love seemed extremely difficult. Still, finding one\u2019s true love was something every teenage girl hoped for, and Sesha had no intention of giving up on it.Just then, it occurred to Sesha that Min Chae-young had been deep in thought for a while now. \u201c\u2026Chae-young?\u201d\u300cHmmm? Huh?\u300dMin Chae-young realized Sesha was staring at her and widened her eyes.Sesha asked with a face of concern, \u201cWhat is it? Is something wrong?\u201d\u300cNo, no\u2026! The thing is, well\u2026\u300dMin Chae-young stuttered, unable to respond properly, and she squeezed her eyes together when she knew she was going to have to give an answer.\u300cW-W-Well\u2026!\u300d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to be uncomfortable around me.\u201d\u300cThe thing is\u2026your\u2026uncle\u2026\u300d\u201cUncle? Uncle Yeon-woo?\u201dNod nod.\u201cWhat about him?\u201d\u300cI was\u2026wondering what kind of person he is\u2026\u300d\u201c\u2026?\u201d Sesha didn\u2019t understand what Min Chae-young was saying. Why was she suddenly asking about her uncle? Was she curious about him because it was the first time they met? Then, she recalled how Min Chae-young jumped in surprise and hid behind the banister when she met eyes with Yeon-woo. She seemed like she was\u2026shy.Even now, as she asked about Yeon-woo, Min Chae-young wasn\u2019t able to look Sesha in the eye. But she kept sneaking glances to see Sesha\u2019s reaction\u2026Sesha suddenly felt dizzy, as if she had been smacked on the back of her head. Of course, even Sesha herself agreed that Yeon-woo was handsome and tall. It was understandable he was popular. But still\u2026! Sesha tightly gripped Min Chae-young\u2019s shoulders. \u201cChae-young.\u201d\u300cHm?\u300dMin Chae-young blinked, taken aback.Sesha had a steeled gaze for some reason. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d\u300c\u2026?\u300d\u201cDo you know how much of an age difference there is between you and Uncle? What you\u2019re feeling is just an infatuation that a lot of teenage girls feel at that age.\u201d\u300c\u2026??\u300d\u201cYou still have a bright future in front of you! What I\u2019m saying is, there will be many people much better than my uncle.\u201d\u300c\u2026???\u300dMin Chae-young looked confused. She didn\u2019t understand what Sesha was getting at.Upon realizing this, Sesha bit her lower lip. Min Chae-young wouldn\u2019t understand if she kept on beating around the bush like this. She would have to use shock therapy on Chae-young. She only wanted her kind and soft friend to not get hurt. \u201cListen up, Chae-young.\u201d\u300cYeah\u2026\u300d\u201cSomeone\u2019s already staked a claim on my uncle.\u201d\u300c\u2026Huh?\u300d\u201cShe\u2019s very pretty. Veeeeeeery. So you should give up on\u2014\u201d\u300cT-That isn\u2019t it!\u300dMin Chae-young finally realized Sesha\u2019s misunderstanding and shouted with a red face.However, Sesha was still serious. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed of falling in love at first sight\u2026!\u201d\u300cIt\u2019s really not that!\u300d\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d\u300cYes!\u300d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201d\u300cYes!\u300d\u201cThen why did you\u2026\u201d\u300cI felt something strange from your uncle, so I was just wondering what that was!\u300d\u201cHm? You felt something\u2026?\u201d\u300cYeah\u2026\u300dMin Chae-young explained the strange sensation she had when she saw Yeon-woo. Her heart beat faster, and it felt like her blood was being slowly leached out\u2026\u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t those the symptoms of being lovesick?\u201d\u300cArgh, it\u2019s really not! It\u2019s like\u2026\u300dMin Chae-young debated her word choice and spoke carefully.\u300cMy eyes keep searching him..\u300d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u300cThen when I make eye contact, my heart throbbed.\u300d\u201cUmm\u2026?\u201d\u300cSo I can\u2019t get him off my mind\u2026\u300d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s love sickness though?\u201d\u300cIt\u2019s not!\u300dMin Chae-young punched her adorable fists in the air.\u300cI! Like someone else!\u300d\u201cWhat?\u201d Sesha looked beyond stunned, even more stunned from when she thought Min Chae-young liked Yeon-woo.\u300cT-That isn\u2019t something to be so shocked about!\u300d\u201cI don\u2019t you were so naive that you wouldn\u2019t have those kinds of feelings for anyone\u2026!\u201d\u300cYou\u2019re making fun of me right now, aren\u2019t you?!\u300d\u201cOops! You caught me.\u201d\u300cHey!\u300dMin Chae-young clenched her fists angrily, but Sesha just laughed louder. \u2018She\u2019s too cute. How can I not tease her?\u2019 Sesha suddenly realized this might be how Park Yoo-min felt, but she pushed that thought far into a deep crevice of her mind.\u201cThen can you speak in more detail? Exactly how did you feel after seeing Uncle? If you felt any magic power flowing, was it different than normal? Were you nervous, or did you feel repelled by him? Things like that.\u201d Sesha couldn\u2019t continue to tease her friend forever. At this rate, Min Chae-young might really get mad, so Sesha decided to lend a serious listening ear.Min Chae-young still looked sulky, but she nodded and continued.\u300cSo\u2026\u300d* * *\u201cIsn\u2019t that the thing called a \u2018fragment?\u201d\u300cFragment?\u300dAfter listening to Min Chae-young\u2019s explanation, Sesha concluded that the various emotions Chae-young felt wasn\u2019t from love sickness but nervousness. It was the same kind of nervousness a mouse felt in front of a snake.\u2018I made a mistake\u2026\u2019 Sesha apologized to Min Chae-young. She had teased Chae-young, but Chae-young had actually been feeling fear. She couldn\u2019t believe she teased a friend without properly knowing the situation first. She had no excuse even if Chae-young was mad.However, it seemed Chae-young didn\u2019t realize those emotions were nervousness and fear. If the level of her soul was any higher, she would\u2019ve felt threatened upon realizing Yeon-woo was a being who shouldn\u2019t be resisted. Right now, she just didn\u2019t feel the danger because there was too wide a gap between their strength.Just like how a blind man didn\u2019t know an elephant\u2019s leg even when touching it, Min Chae-young didn\u2019t take the danger for what it was. However, apparently, the star fragment had realized this. The fragment and her soul were somewhat synchronized, so those feelings had been conveyed to Chae-young.Min Chae-young told Sesha it was all right, but her head was still muddled. She was now able to start understanding what this star fragment was. \u2018Is the reason why I exist all because of this?\u2019 Min Chae-young rubbed the part of the chest where she could feel the throbbing. When she felt her heart beating earlier, that had been the star fragment. The thumping of her heart was just the fragment vibrating.Even now, because Yeon-woo was nearby, the star fragment was vibrating. When Min Chae-young closed her eyes and focused, she could feel the shape of the fragment, as well as the magic power slowly circling it.\u2018There\u2019s so much.\u2019 Min Chae-young was only a beginner, but as a result of a few magic lessons, she grasped how incredible the energy of this star fragment was. If she could digest it all, how powerful would she be? Could she really be one of those stars sparkling in the sky? After she digested it and more, could she reach the level of Sesha\u2019s grandparents, Kronos and Rhea? And if so\u2026\u2018\u2026Can I meet him?\u2019 At some point, after learning magic, Min Chae-young began to want to find the boy who had been her warm spring breeze. She was fine with seeing him from afar, and it was okay even if he had forgotten her. She just wanted to see him once.In the beginning, it was just a faint desire, but now she had hope that it might really be possible. Kronos and Rhea, who offered to help, weren\u2019t able to find him easily, however. But Min Chae-young thought that made sense.\u2018He was definitely different from other children.\u2019 At the time, Min Chae-young had been exhausted mentally and wasn\u2019t able to spare him much thought. In retrospect, he had definitely been a mysterious child. He was different from the other kids their age\u2026as if he was living in a different world by himself\u2026Even when Chae-young looked at it from a magical point of view, he was different from normal people. It was before dungeons and gates opened, but it was possible he was like Kronos and Rhea, a holy being who had been hiding his identity on Earth. Or perhaps he was closely related to one\u2026 Whatever he was, it was most important to Chae-young that she had hope. If she had some ability, even if Kronos and Rhea couldn\u2019t help, she could search for him around the universe.\u2018Of course, I\u2019ll have to learn how to control this fragment first\u2026\u2019 Min Chae-young clenched her fists. She decided to think optimistically. All her life, she had been on the receiving end of wrong treatment and lived passively. Even now, she was being chased by those stars or whatever, but she wanted to stand tall over it all.Unlike in the past, she now had Sesha, as well as Kronos and Rhea. She had these grateful family-like people by her side\u2026so she could do it. Her flow of thought turned to Yeon-woo again. The mere thought of him instilled fear in her. \u2018But wouldn\u2019t someone like him know how to control this fragment?\u2019\u201cBut you know\u2026\u201dMin Chae-young was broken out of her reverse as Sesha spoke up.\u300cHm?\u300d\u201cYou said there\u2019s a guy you like.\u201d\u300cT-T-That\u2019s\u2026!\u300dMin Chae-young\u2019s face flushed.\u201cIs that the guy you talked about before? That Son\u2014\u201d\u300cAhhhhhhh! Don\u2019t say it! I can\u2019t hear you! Ahhhh! Ahhhhhh! Ahhhhhhh!\u300dMin Chae-young covered her ears and paced around the room shouting in an attempt to block out Sesha.Sesha burst out laughing at her friend\u2019s cute reaction. At the same time, a part of her began to wonder. Yeon-woo and Edora, Jeong-woo and Ananta, Kronos and Rhea. And even Min Chae-young and the boy named\u2026Son Jae-won. What was love, and how did it feel? Sesha wanted to know.* * *Allforone\u2026 Vivasvat\u2026 Son Jae-won\u2026 No, the shell of all those beings\u2026was currently in the middle of the long dream tightly bound in emptiness that Yeon-woo had put him in. He was dreaming of the old days, the days when his mom and dad loved him dearly, the days he stressed them out because he didn\u2019t know those were the happy days, a time before stepping foot into this damned world filled with pain and suffering.\u2026Jae-won.\u00a0In the dream, he was listening to the voice of a friend who only smiled at him. The voice of the one he realized was his first love too late.\u2026Hi.\u00a0It was a short greeting he\u2019d wanted to hear but was never able to. The word was deeply imprinted in his heart.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 58": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Second Life RankerCH ss - 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySide Story Chapter 41 - The Third Zone (1)\u201cWhy\u2019s that guy suddenly coming out here?!\u201d Jeong-woo dropped the book he was reading in surprise and jumped up. He had finally found a clue to Yeon-woo\u2019s whereabouts. However, he questioned why he had appeared so late. The time gap was too wide.There was naturally a time difference in multiple universes and parallel universes, but there were limits to that difference. From when Yeon-woo appeared at the original world line\u2015world line #0\u2015there was a difference from when he learned of the dismantling of the First Star, the Martial King Nayu. There should be around\u2026ten thousand years in between. That was enough time for thousands of the beings who called themselves \u201cstars\u201d to be created. However, the problem was\u2026\u201c\u2026Where?!\u201dWhile all these beings were created, Jeong-woo hadn\u2019t sensed anything at all. Aside from being Deus Ex Machina, an omniscient being who ruled and controlled all the cogs known as the worlds, universes, \u00a0 \u00a0and laws, he was also a bookkeeper and librarian who organized and protected all the records produced by the cogs.Jeong-woo had magnified the trait he received from his mother, Quirinale, and synchronized it with the laws of the world. It was not a stretch to say Cha Jeong-woo was literally the laws of causality. He was also proud of his position, and he was certain he\u2019d upheld all the duties required of him.However, at this moment, Jeong-woo asked himself.\u00a0Was I really doing a proper job? Was I observing all the businesses of the world? Did I miss anything? Did I slack because I was busy? Did I not properly look into things that required a second look because I was out of it? Is it too late to fix my mistakes\u2015?!\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201dCha Jeong-woo suddenly heard a voice as he was wallowing around in shame. He quickly collected himself. The Heavenly Demon was watching him. The aura exuded by the Heavenly Demon had forced his shaking soul to get a grip.The Heavenly Demon could know anything he wanted, including the thoughts and feelings of mortals, transcendents, and even other emperors. The only one he wasn\u2019t able to watch was the Black King, who stood on equal ground to him.The Heavenly Demon had jolted Jeong-woo awake from being swallowed by the thoughts of what it was he had missed.\u2018\u2026I guess I went overboard.\u2019 Jeong-woo smiled wryly at Shanon and Nocturne, who were looking at him with concern.The Heavenly Demon crossed his arms and spoke in a standoffish tone. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, so don\u2019t worry. Technically, I was the slacker.\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon scratched his temples as he stalled for time. It didn\u2019t seem like it was because the situation was difficult to explain. Rather, he seemed to be uncomfortable at having to reveal something he\u2019d kept hidden.\u300eMan, if you know something, stop hiding it and\u2026. Hehehe. I\u2019m just saying. You don\u2019t have to frown like that. You\u2019ll only get wrinkles. Hehehe. Is there anything you need?\u300fWhen the Heavenly Demon raised a fist, Shanon bowed and rubbed his hands together. His forehead was going to touch the floor at this rate, and the Heavenly Demon looked at him with disbelief.Cha Jeong-woo\u2019s silent gaze continued to demand an answer from the Heavenly Demon, and the Heavenly Demon sighed. He spoke directly to Jeong-woo. \u201cThe knowledge in this library\u2026 You know what \u2018gnosis\u2019 is, right?\u201d\u201cYou taught me that it\u2019s the records created from what the many beings and their souls see and understand.\u201d\u201cRight. Mortals, transcendents\u2026 Gods, demons, dragons, giants\u2026 Any being that has a \u2018soul\u2019 is able to learn knowledge. They can gain enlightenment and twist the already existing laws to create new laws. And all these are only possible where light reaches.\u201dLight wasn\u2019t a simple matter. It made up the world and was always expanding. Its speed raced forward, faster than anything else, to establish time and history. Also, because it expanded the universe, it was the most necessary and basic material for creation.The creation of the universe and the world was still in progress. Space wasn\u2019t fixed; it continued to expand and create new planets and birthed civilizations. Naturally, the more the civilization, the more transcendents were born.Law was established where light reached, and universes were made. Moreover, the beings born in this area could only see where the light had reached. They could interpret the laws and learn knowledge from them. Like this, civilizations advanced, and more gnosis appeared in the library. That was what the phrase \u201clight is knowledge\u201d meant.Light was already stretching, the universe expanded, and gnosis was steadily stacked up. There was no concept of \u201ccompletion.\u201d It was a never-ending process. That was this universe\u2019s absolute truth, and this was what the Heavenly Demon was speaking about.\u201cThat light is me, so I become stronger even when I\u2019m doing nothing. The greater the universe expands, the wider the territory of light becomes. In the past, it was occasionally cut off when the Black King and I fought over the wheels and dreams, but I don\u2019t have to worry about that anymore.\u201d\u201cSir.\u201d\u201cYes? Well, I understand you admire me, but you don\u2019t need to\u2014\u201d\u201cPlease get to the point.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon looked dumbfounded. No one in this world spoke to him like that.\u00a0Crunch!\u00a0Belatedly, he realized what he\u2019d just heard and he gritted his teeth. \u201c\u2026You punk, you\u2019re exactly like your twin!\u201d\u201cBecause we\u2019re twins.\u201d\u201cI should set a day and beat you up\u2026\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019m going to quit.\u201d\u201c\u2026Dammit.\u201dIf Jeong-woo quit, the job would go back to the Heavenly Demon again, and the Heavenly Demon had resolved that such a thing should never happen. He knew better than anyone how hard the labor was\u2026! He had barely rid himself of the job to have some free time, but Jeong-woo quitting? Quitting?! Over his dead body!\u201cOkay, okay! I\u2019ll tell you, geez!\u201d The Heavenly Demon was put in the position of a powerless employer being bullied by a wicked employee. He quickly got to the point. He ignored how Shanon was looking at Cha Jeong-woo with admiring eyes. Everyone who associated with Yeon-woo had terrible personalities anyway. The Heavenly Demon asked, \u201cSo, then what do you think happens where it doesn't reach?\u201d\u201c\u2026it\u2019s where creation doesn\u2019t happen, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s where the concepts of Day and Night came from.\u201dJeong-woo didn\u2019t understand what the Heavenly Demon was getting at.The Eight Gods of Disorder and other otherworld gods were classified into Night (Nox) because their territories didn\u2019t receive any light, and their history wasn\u2019t recorded in the Changgong Library. It was impossible to observe them in the first place.Even the Heavenly Demon, who was omniscient and omnipotent in the territory of Day (Eros), didn\u2019t have a way to know much about them.Still, Jeong-woo wasn\u2019t worried. Yeon-woo had full control over the territory of Night. But just then, the Heavenly Demon grinned mischievously and asked, \u201cWhat if there\u2019s a third zone that\u2019s neither Day nor Night?\u201dJeong-woo stiffened, as did Shanon and Nocturne. They didn\u2019t understand; they had never heard of such a thing before.\u201cWhen light and darkness didn\u2019t exist yet, and only chaos reigned, the universe was only made up of the dream of the Black King\u2026 The being the creatures of the Night call \u2018dim-witted father.\u2019\u201dThis was the history before the beginning\u2026before the first wheel and dream even began. Now, the Heavenly Demon was likely the only being to know this story.\u201cIn the middle of a dream, a mysterious crack appeared, and when that became bigger, Pangu was born. The creation of the universe began as the egg of chaos cracked and light appeared.\u201d The Heavenly Demon\u2019s eyes darkened as he continued, \u201cThe light released from the cracked egg became Day, and the territories that weren\u2019t affected by this were called Night. I was lucky to take that Day in my hands, and I continued to fight the Black King, who wanted to repeat the Night.\u201dJeong-woo was familiar with this much. The Heavenly Demon absorbed the Pangu who was born from the egg of chaos and rose to his current position. His power to stand against the Black King originated from there.\u201cHowever, no one worried about the cracked eggshell.\u201dJeong-woo started to see what the Heavenly Demon was speaking about.\u201cReally, no one had the mind to. I was busy beating up the beings of Night to make the weak Day powerful, and the Black King didn\u2019t care because he was too busy snoring.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was too late when I realized creatures that didn\u2019t belong to either Day or Night were entering the world\u2019s backend\u2026and they had already become the foundation of Idea.\u201d The Heavenly Demon looked frustrated. \u201cIt had become a zone with entirely different compositions and laws to the extent that it was impossible to observe or interfere with it. It\u2019s a paradoxical zone that can exist theoretically but doesn\u2019t really exist.\u201dFor one to exist, two conditions had to be met. One, it had to have a soul, and two, it had to belong to either Day or Night. Only then could the being moved freely. It was impossible for a being to exist away from the worlds of the Black King and the Heavenly Demon. Souls could not take place. Even if something did exist, it was only a shell, and even if there was some truth, they were all lies. It didn\u2019t exist in the first place. That was why it was a paradox. A chaos more chaotic than chaos itself.\u201cEven I don\u2019t know what exists there. I wasn\u2019t interested, and there was no reason for me to be. So for creatures to have evaded the eyes of me, you, and Yeon-woo, this is the first thing that comes to mind. That\u2019s the only place that\u2019s hidden from our eyes.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026!\u201d Jeong-woo unwittingly exclaimed in shock a while later. His expression was one of bitterness. \u201c\u2026I thought I was starting to understand now, but this world is still filled with things I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s arrogant to think you know something. We\u2019re free from it, but as long as the universe and world exist, it\u2019ll continue to change. There are still things I don\u2019t know too. No one knows what the eggshell of chaos that\u2019s at the bottom of Idea looks like. Something I don\u2019t know about could pop up suddenly anytime anywhere.\u201dThe sentence echoed in Jeong-woo\u2019s head.\u00a0Something I don\u2019t know about could pop up suddenly anytime anywhere.\u00a0Jeong-woo felt like his vision widened. Once again, he was able to realize this world was really full of mysteries.\u201c\u2026If you think about it that way, the puzzle becomes even greater trying to figure out where the Black King, who existed prior to the creation of the universe, came from.\u201d\u201cRight? You\u2019ll never get anything done if you dig too deeply into things.\u201dIn Buddhism, there was a concept of \u201cthree thousand realms.\u201d Countless worlds were tied together to become one thousand realms, those realms were doubled to become two thousand realms, and another added became three thousand realms. This idea explained that countless concepts could continue to expand infinitely.\u2018The world that I know might just be limited to these three thousand realms.\u2019 Right now, to Jeong-woo, everything was confusing.\u201cYeon-woo could\u2019ve gone to find the star fragment there, so let\u2019s continue to see.\u201dJeong-woo nodded.\u201cAnyhow\u2026\u201d The Heavenly Demon felt slightly more relieved now, but his gaze focused on the books was sharp. \u201cKronos, that bastard, didn\u2019t recognize me when I was right in front of him?\u201dSon Jae-won, Son Ji-ho, and Seo Eun-yeong\u2026 The Heavenly Demon definitely knew what these names were. \u201cJust you wait.\u201d He wasn\u2019t angry because he was venting his anger from Jeong-woo, who threatened to quit, to his father. Absolutely not.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She didn\u2019t understand what her friend, Park Yoo-min, was talking about when she said stuff like \u201cstanning\u201d and \u201cbias,\u201d but Athena was the very definition of cool. She hoped this cool unnie could take down the villainous-looking Odin.* * *A heavy silence descended upon them.\u201c\u2026I see you\u2019re still impudent.\u201d Odin looked down at his wrist and frowned. At the same time, a violent aura began to whirl around him.\u00a0Caaaaw!\u00a0A horrifying screech echoed around them.Odin\u2019s nickname was \u2018Father of Dead Warriors.\u2019 It was a nickname that stuck because he collected the souls of warriors who died on the battlefield and used them as his soldiers.The screeching in the storm of power were the screams from souls who shouted Odin\u2019s name on battlefields and died after worshiping Odin. Each and every one of them was hostile toward Athena. As soon as Odin gave the order, they would dash toward her and attempt to release an onslaught of curses and bad energy.Of course, none of it would endanger Athena, since she was as powerful as Odin. With Yeon-woo entering this time period as the Black King\u2019s main ego, the chief apostle of the Black King had a strength that was equal to Kronos during his prime.Odin was well aware of this, especially since his remaining eye was the \u201cWise Eye\u201d that contained all the knowledge in the world. In that short window of time, his Wise Eye had estimated Athena\u2019s level and given a conclusion to their potential battle. The result was very simple.\u00a0Impossible.It meant Odin should never engage in a fight with Athena. However, he should be able to get on her nerves. It was the additional insight his eye gave him. So Odin glared at the new leader of Olympus who dared to bare her teeth at him. He acted like he was ready to have their showdown here if it came down to it.Of course, Athena didn\u2019t back down either. Asgard was always compared with Olympus. With Kronos out of the picture, it was said Asgard had grown in power, but as someone who dreamt of Olympus\u2019 next golden age, she couldn\u2019t back down here.No, in the first place, she didn\u2019t even consider the idea. The person she just saved was formally the niece of the king of Olympus, but on a personal level, she was her cousin. In other words, they were blood-related\u2026 Athena had her pride as the older sister, so she couldn\u2019t stay silent.\u201cYou should consider where you are and what will be taking place here.\u201dAthena was so competitive that she had even emerged victorious in a standoff with her uncle, Poseidon. She had a rational personality most of the time, but in a fight, she was aggressive and never backed down.\u201cAre you saying I, Odin, need to be prudent around the One-horned tribe?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Odin\u2019s eyes narrowed.Athena lifted a corner of her mouth. \u201cDidn\u2019t you come here because you were being prudent?\u201dCaaaaw!\u00a0The screeching became louder as rough winds twisted.\u201cH-Huh?\u201d\u201cAh, fuck! What are you doing?!\u201d\u201cThey warned us not to fight\u2026!\u201d\u201cDamn it! Escape first!\u201dThe people standing nearby quickly began to leave, not wanting to get caught up by the winds.\u00a0Swish! Crack, crack.\u00a0Street vendors were knocked over and the ground split open.\u201cWhat\u2019s the One-horned tribe doing, not stopping them?!\u201dThe gods of Asgard led by Odin and the gods of Olympus following Athena all raised their weapons.\u201cI see we\u2019re five minutes from a shitshow starting.\u201d Suddenly, a rough voice rang sinisterly in the sky. Odin\u2019s screeches and winds were ominous, but this voice contained a more threatening fear. It was demonic energy, and it was so thick and black that it was reminiscent of an abyss. Only one demon out of all the demons had this energy.[\u2018Baal\u2019 descends!]Babam!\u00a0Black lightning soared through the sky and crashed down where Athena and Odin were. Athena and Odin quickly stepped back, and black whirlwinds spun where the lightning landed to slowly take the form of a human.\u00a0Crackle, crackle.\u00a0The level of his divinity was so great that black demonic energy came off in sparks.When a face slowly took shape, the leader of L\u2019Infernal, Baal, was grinning ferociously. However, everyone present knew he wasn\u2019t smiling out of happiness.\u201cThis is the Martial King\u2019s territory. Don\u2019t think of causing trouble and making fools out of yourselves, hm?\u201dRumble, rumble, rumble![\u2018Vassago\u2019 descends!][\u2018Aamon\u2019 descends!][\u2018Barbatos\u2019 descends!]\u2026The amount of demonic energy amplified as demon kings appeared behind Baal one by one.[The demonic society <L\u2019Infernal> reveals its entirety!]The aura exuded by the great army of around seventy demons was the very definition of violence.\u201cL-L\u2019Infernal\u2026!\u201d\u201cAll of the absolute evil is here\u2026!\u201dThose who had inwardly been looking to a clash between Athena and Odin swallowed. This was the society of absolute evil, a society that didn\u2019t even budge when great disturbances occurred in the heavenly world. Most people here had never seen a demon king in their entire lives, so they were beyond shocked.However, Odin didn\u2019t seem affected in the slightest and continued to exude a vicious aura. \u201cBaal, you dare to threaten me with your tiny gang?\u201dBaal\u2019s smile only grew. \u201cDoes it seem that way?\u201d\u201cWhy? Are you going to apologize?\u201d\u201cI was going to say you saw right.\u201dImmediately after Baal finished speaking, an onlooker shouted upon discovering a strange phenomenon, \u201cHuh? I-It\u2019s an aurora!\u201dA warm ray of sunlight suddenly shined in the sky filled with dark storm clouds.[Metatron descends!][Michael is\u2026!][Raphael is\u2026!]\u2026[The godly society <Malach> reveals itself on the earth!]Opposite of where L\u2019Infernal was standing, archangels with their radiant wings were centered around Metatron, the celestial scribe. Celestial energy flowed in the space where the demonic energy was and pushed the storm clouds away.\u201cEven Malach\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhy is absolute good here? Is a war about to begin\u2026?\u201dPeople clamored in confusion, then Metatron suddenly began to speak with a benevolent smile. \u201cDisturbances only call for great disturbances. With Allforone missing and all the divine beings able to descend to the lower world, the heavenly world is already unsettled. We can\u2019t allow the order of the heavenly world to be wrecked with a minor fight like this, can we?\u201dMetatron\u2019s gaze was focused on Odin and Athena. The gods of Asgard stiffened. Although Metatron might\u2019ve been tactical about it, he was subtly taking Olympus\u2019 side.\u201cIt\u2019s always been this way.\u201dOlympus, L\u2019Infernal, and Malach, the three of the stronger societies in the heavenly world, were standing against Asgard. However, Odin didn\u2019t seem to be concerned. \u201cThe actions of those who are on the Heavenly Demon\u2019s side are made to look nice on the outside. But on the inside, it\u2019s just greedy beings who are busy trying to fulfill their selfish needs.\u201dAthena, Baal, and Metatron stiffened. It was clear Odin was belittling Baal and Metatron for controlling the heavenly world behind the scenes to assist the Heavenly Demon. Athena knew about the secret of Olympus after having heard it from Yeon-woo.\u201cBut with the Heavenly Demon and Black King having reconciled\u2026\u201d Odin\u2019s Wise Eye flashed. \u201cIt\u2019ll be amusing to watch how long this alliance of yours lasts.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a frequent event throughout history for alliances to be broken through internal conflict after the common enemy disappears.\u201dAthena, Metatron, and Baal couldn\u2019t deny Odin firmly for some reason. They wanted to say that wasn\u2019t true, but they knew Odin\u2019s foresight wasn\u2019t something to ignore.Odin tossed the cane he pulled out of his subspace back in and turned in the opposite direction. \u201cWe will be returning to our lodgings.\u201d[The godly society <Asgard> retreats!]Sssssssss.\u201cThey\u2019re just running away, but they\u2019re trying to save face until the end. Tsk tsk! How pitiful.\u201d Baal snorted as he watched Odin. It was obvious Asgard was being forced to retreat with the current situation, but it was hilarious how they were trying to save their pride. \u201cAnyhow, Athena, and niece of the Black King.\u201dSesha was surprised when Baal called her out. \u2018He knows me\u2026?\u2019 L\u2019Infernal was a vast demonic society well-known for keeping the balance and order of the ninety-eighth floor. Even she knew them. She couldn\u2019t help but be surprised that their leader knew her.\u201cWould you like a cookie?\u201dThen, when Baal dug in his pockets and pulled out a set of cookies, Sesha's eyes widened again for a different reason. Cookies were laid neatly in a square tin box. Her mouth watered seeing the amply amount of chocolate chips per cookie.\u201cSmells delicious, doesn\u2019t it? Hehe. This is actually made of a type of cacao called the shedd bean that only grows on the eighty-third floor. This is very special to me, but I\u2019ll share some with you since you\u2019ve both gone through a lot.\u201dSesha\u2019s eyes turned as big as saucers. The greatest demon of the great demons was giving her a cookie set? She hesitated at the strange situation.Suddenly, Metatron appeared from behind Sesha and took a big handful of cookies, stuffing them in his mouth. \u201cYou can safely eat it. Baal\u2019s hobby is baking desserts. The strawberry cakes he makes with blood strawberries from the ninety-first floor is also amazing. Its scent is incredible.\u201dBaal\u2019s already rugged-looking appearance turned even scarier. \u201cHey. I never offered you any.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all the same when it goes inside our stomachs anyway. Who cares who eats it as long as it's eaten deliciously? Yum!\u201d\u201cArgh\u2026 Keep blabbering on like that, won\u2019t you?\u201d Baal glared at Metatron in disbelief, but Metatron just took another handful of cookies and swallowed joyfully. He signaled for Sesha to try some as well.Sesha hesitated for a bit and took a small bite of a cookie. \u2018I-It\u2019s so good\u2026!\u2019 The bitter sweetness of cacao and the moistness of the well-baked cookie filled her mouth. The cookie was still warm, and her eyes widened at the texture. It was devilishly delicious.\u201cOh.\u201d Sesha blindly savored the taste of the cookies, then regretfully realized she finished all the cookies.Metatron faintly smiled at how adorable Sesha was. \u201cLooks like the Black King\u2019s nieces enjoy Baal\u2019s special cookies very much\u2026 Would you like some more?\u201dBaal scoffed while crossing his arms. \u201cOf course she does! There\u2019s no bad person among people who know the charm of cookies. There\u2019s not much, but enjoy.\u201d\u201cBut demons enjoy these cookies, don\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cMetatron, I think you should shut up.\u201dWhile Baal and Metatron bickered, it occurred to Sesha that she shouldn\u2019t keep this delicious goodness to herself. She wondered how she could get these to her uncle and grandfather, and she happened to overhear what Athena was saying to Baal.\u201cI don\u2019t see Lord Agares. Did he go somewhere?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBaal, who had been maintaining a composed attitude, suddenly crumpled his face and gave no response.\u201cDid\u2026something happen?\u201d Athena carefully asked.Baal recalled the words the damned idiot said before leaving L\u2019Infernal and rubbed his throbbing temples.What? He dares to get married without my permission? Says who? This won\u2019t do! Puppy! Get ready!Woof!He didn\u2019t even know what that bastard was up to. Baal sighed to himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are they to your liking?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re delicious. My wife will like them very much.\u201d\u201cHeh.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why are you laughing like that?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re already calling her your \u2018wife.\u2019 Nice times.\u201dMetatron and Baal soon received an invitation from Yeon-woo, who had already known of their descent. Yeon-woo treated them respectfully as the friends of Uranos, his grandfather. These were beings who had worked with his grandfather before the wheel of the universe began to spin, and tried to prevent the Black King\u2019s reign. Although only a miniscule portion of their power from their prime remained, their missions were still deserving of admiration.Yeon-woo requested they speak informally to him, and Baal readily agreed like the demon he was. Metatron just smiled in response.But as soon as Baal dropped the formalities, he suddenly pulled something out. He said it was a wedding present. They were\u2026cookies and tea. Yeon-woo suddenly wondered if demons ate cookies, but he recalled Baal had the same hobby before the wheel was spun. He\u2019d said something about how baking was his only hobby in the despair of repeating universes\u2026 Something along those lines.Together, they all had cookies and tea. Baal treated Yeon-woo like the grandson of his close friend, and this made Yeon-woo\u2019s heart heavier for a moment. He was reminded of his grandfather, whom he\u2019d seen in Kronos\u2019 legends.Since Yeon-woo could rewind the wheel now, he thought about taking Edora to greet his grandfather too\u2026 Yeon-woo began to make plans to visit.\u201cYou know now, right? That we were watching you all this time.\u201dThe Black King chose an executor from the wheel to lead the universe to its end. Yeon-woo was chosen as the executor for this universe, and Metatron and Baal made preparations to step up in case Yeon-woo awakened.\u201cBut\u2026your existence was suddenly transported somewhere else, and your aura changed entirely. As if your new aura was always yours. I was so shocked back then. Ha!\u201d Baal shivered as if he was still overcoming the shock when he realized Yeon-woo had become the Black King. For the Baal of this time period, it felt like the moment he\u2019d been waiting for so long suddenly arrived. \u201cWill you tell us about your life?\u201dYeon-woo nodded, ready to tell them everything. These beings deserved to know everything as they were the heroes who\u2019d awaited the peace and safety of the world more than anything else.* * *\u201c\u2026And that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\u201cMmmm.\u201dYeon-woo told the two the truth about everything that took place. He shared how he became the Black King, why he rewound the wheel, and his plan to search for the star fragments after the wedding ceremony was over.Baal crossed his arms and became lost in thought. Then, Metatron spoke up for the first time. \u201c\u2026Then there are two questions I have here, my lord.\u201dClink.\u00a0Metatron put his teacup down, a small action that pulled all attention to him. \u201cFirst. What will happen to this Yvlke who opposed you? And there\u2019s also the issue of the other executor candidate, Harmonia.\u201dYeon-woo chuckled and responded, \u201cDid you forget what the purpose of the Bureau is, sir?\u201d\u201cPurpose\u2026? Oh!\u201d Metatron tilted his head, and let out an exclamation when he belatedly came to a realization.The beings of the Bureau were spokespersons for the system. They carried out the necessary procedures the system wasn\u2019t able to do itself. So what power did Yeon-woo have over them as the system\u2019s administrator?\u201cI retrieved all his abilities as the Black King\u2019s ego. I also removed him from his Guardian position. I think it\u2019s only obvious what happened after that.\u201dAn Yvlke who wasn\u2019t an ego of the Black King or a High Guardian\u2026 He did have his status as a face of the Heavenly Demon, but all greater divine beings knew the Heavenly Demon didn\u2019t pay attention to his shadows.Yvlke had most likely lost the majority of his power as a face of the Heavenly Demon. On top of that, Yvlke was an object of fear and resentment within the Bureau due to acting as the villain for so long. There weren\u2019t many in the organization who wanted him to stay in his position.Yvlke\u2019s political enemies also wouldn\u2019t leave him alone. But Yvlke wasn\u2019t one to silently suffer, so he would step up to the fight. There were still a good number of beings who took Yvlke\u2019s side.Metatron could picture clearly the Bureau divided over internal conflict.\u201cTemper\u2026\u201d Metatron was reminded of what Yeon-woo\u2019s subordinate called him. He quickly lifted his hand and lightly smacked himself on the lips. \u201cMy bad.\u201d\u201c\u2026The way your eyes are crinkled suggests you don\u2019t feel bad at all.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a misunderstanding, my lord.\u201d\u201cYou know, the truth always comes out when faced with a fist, sir.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re quite similar to your grandfather in that aspect.\u201d\u201cThe genes never went anywhere.\u201dYeon-woo\u2019s brazen way of speaking was similar to Uranos as well.Metatron shifted to look outside the building\u2019s window. It was the direction of where the resurrected Kronos was staying. Based on what he could sense, Kronos had definitely restored his power to when he was king of gods. The Black King and the king of gods roaming the universe together\u2026\u2018\u2026The end of things might be coming.\u2019Perhaps it wasn\u2019t the right thing to stop the wheel from spinning. Metatron decided not to think any further on the topic. He asked, \u201cThen I will ask you my second question now. What will you do about this Tower now, Black King?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll leave it alone.\u201d\u201cLeave it alone\u2026?\u201d\u201cThere needs to be a device in place that keeps the Black King\u2019s real body bound.\u201dMetatron stiffened, and Baal spoke up. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to prepare things in advance, just in case you get stabbed in the back when you leave for the Unreal World in search of the stars?\u201d\u201cI prefer to be the one doing the stabbing. I\u2019d hate to be stabbed by someone else.\u201dBaal had a dumbfounded expression as he turned to Metatron. \u201c\u2026I think he really is Uranos\u2019 grandson.\u201d\u201cI believe it would be more accurate to say he is a more advanced version of Uranos and Kronos.\u201d\u201cAll three generations are bad-tempered\u2026\u201d Now, even Baal was starting to worry about the future of this universe, but Yeon-woo wasn\u2019t affected by their reactions.\u201cAnyway, so you\u2019re saying you want us to make sure no one touches the empty real body while you\u2019re absent searching for the star fragments, huh?\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cThe Tower will be binding the true body of the Black King, R'lyeh, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it running wild on its own\u2026 So all we have to do is prevent stars and other small fish trying to approach it\u2026 Hm?\u201d Baal tilted his head when something suddenly occurred to him. \u201cSomething\u2019s weird though. To approach R'lyeh, they\u2019ll have to approach the Tower. Then they\u2019ll be trapped inside\u2026!\u201dBaal trailed off and covered his face with his hand. \u201c\u2026So it\u2019s a trap.\u201d\u201cWe need to catch the mice that are attracted to the cheese.\u201dBaal started to become scared of Yeon-woo. Most of the small fish were probably going to be stars. They had preyed on each other, and they were probably starving for more power. If Yeon-woo happened to \u201ccoincidentally\u201d be absent, they\u2019d gather toward the Black King\u2019s real body like moths. And that was what Yeon-woo was aiming for. Once they were trapped in the Tower, no matter how strong they were, they wouldn\u2019t be able to escape the Tower if they couldn\u2019t clear the one-hundredth floor. That meant Yeon-woo could retrieve many star fragments without having to lift a finger.However, Baal was flabbergasted by Yeon-woo\u2019s plan. He could understand trying to create a trap for the stars, but who would think of using the Black King\u2019s real body as bait?! He was at a loss for words. \u2018I suppose he\u2019s gotten to where he is today because that\u2019s how he thinks.\u2019Yeon-woo was fearsome in more ways than one.\u201cAnyway, so you require beings who can control and rule the creatures who enter the Tower. Like what we\u2019ve been doing all this time.\u201dBaal scowled at what Metatron said. \u201cI thought I could finally rest now. But you want me to suffer through that again?\u201dYeon-woo shook his head firmly. \u201cDo you think I would work my grandfather\u2019s friends like slaves?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s plenty possible.\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d Yeon-woo\u2019s grin deepened. \u201cI will send companions to work with you.\u201d\u201cSee! I told you so!\u201d Baal stood up in disbelief, but contrary to his tone, he didn\u2019t truly seem upset. Rather, he seemed curious. He had spent his entire life trying to achieve peace and balance. But now that he was being set free, he was at odds at what to do.However, Yeon-woo was now giving Baal a job that was similar to what he\u2019d done in the past, but it wasn\u2019t going to be as difficult. He was definitely curious. And since he was being given companions, he wouldn\u2019t be bored anymore\u2026!\u201cSo who will you send over?\u201d Metatron asked, also curious.Yeon-woo smiled mysteriously and raised his head. \u201cI invited them here, so they should be arriving any minute.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?! W-What\u2019s this?\u201d Baal paused mid-tilt at the sudden pressure that tried to push him down and widened his eyes.Crash!\u00a0The sound that echoed in the air was something that resounded not in Baal\u2019s soul, but in the abyss that lay deep beneath. Baal knew what this sound meant, so he frantically stepped outside. When he looked up, he saw it.\u201cWhat the f\u2026!\u201d Baal unwittingly cursed. The sky\u2026was being stained black. At the same time, it was covered by fog and countless tentacles.\u201cWhat in the world\u2026?\u201d\u201cW-Why is that appearing here?!\u201d\u201cOtherworld gods! Multiple otherworld gods have appeared!\u201dBaal wasn\u2019t the only one surprised. All the guests who came to bless Yeon-woo\u2019s wedding couldn\u2019t contain their shock. Beings of the outside who looked gruesome to the beings of the inside\u2026 The otherworld gods who instilled fear and horror were about to descend![\u2018The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young\u2019 responds to her father\u2019s cry with a monstrous cry!][\u2018The Nameless Mist\u2019 shouts his father\u2019s name as he sweeps over!][\u2018The Source of Uncleanliness\u2019 says he washed up for the first time in a long while so he can make a good first impression on the being who will become his mother!][\u2018The Green Flame\u2019 congratulates his father\u2019s marriage and dances around!][\u2018The Harbinger\u2019 clears his throat saying he will sing a song for his father!]\u2026[The Eight Gods of Disorder and other otherworld gods reveal themselves.][\u2018Night (Nox)\u2019 blooms!]Each of the otherworld gods were larger than most planets, so only a few of them had come. However, that was more than enough to display their presence. Everyone had been hysterical when only the Crawling Chaos appeared in the past, so they were speechless with all the Eight Gods of Disorder having arrived.Just then, a giant eye opened where Night bloomed.[\u2018The Resident of the Border\u2019 salutes his one and only father.]\u201cBy companions, did you perhaps mean\u2026\u201d When Yeon-woo smiled quietly, Baal dropped his face into his hands. He almost cursed. As someone who had lived eons on hostile terms with the beings, this was something he\u2019d never expected. \u201c\u2026Hey, Metatron.\u201d\u201cYes. Please speak, Baal.\u201d\u201cI take back what I said. That guy\u2019s a greater psycho than Uranos.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201d Metatron smiled wryly and nodded.But just then\u2026\u00a0du du du\u2026!\u00a0From the other side, a gigantic shadow began to stand up. A scary-looking bunny with thick muscles was slowly becoming bigger.[\u2018The Lord of the Pole\u2019 begins a muscle show for his father!]\u300eOhuhuhu. Please don\u2019t forget about me, the cutie Laplace!\u300fLaplace was an attention-seeker who would rather die than have the attention stolen from him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were living on the land that only the chosen ones could live on.\u201cThe path to descend is blocked.\u201d Asgard\u2019s king, Odin, slowly opened an eye.Unlike the other Sky Fathers, who represented completion, dignity, authority, and sanctity, Odin had a great fault. He only saw through one eye and used a blindfold.Other Sky Fathers considered beings with faults to be stupid or weak. Because beings like them were made from spiritual bodies and not physical bodies, they could easily restore any fault as long as they had enough holy power.The fact that Odin still only had one eye could mean he wasn\u2019t powerful enough to overcome his heavenly form. It was only natural he was judged to be unworthy of being a Sky Father. However, nobody thought that of him. They all knew he had lost an eye to gain something greater: the power of foresight. He had the ability to see the future.Odin was the reason the small society that was always in conflict over battles between the Aesir and Vanir was able to grow this much. And right now, Odin was looking at a new scene. It was the destruction of Asgard.Caaaw! Caaw!\u00a0The two crows on Odin\u2019s shoulders, Hugin and Munin, screeched.It\u2019s the end, the end!We\u2019re all going to die!We\u2019ll die if we stay here!We\u2019ll die even if we attempt to leave!The heavenly world was currently locked shut after Yeon-woo interfered with the system. Due to this, Asgard and many other societies were busy attempting to get through the \u201cmysterious\u201d block. However, as things didn\u2019t go their way, they sought Odin to find a way.Odin activated his foresight for five days without any rest, not stopping to sleep or eat, but he was only able to reach a conclusion after using most of his holy power. As someone who had spent most of his life to grow Asgard to their position today, Odin was disbelieving of what he saw.\u2018Was it the Martial King\u2026? The end of the wheel I saw before was a result of that mortal. However, it\u2019s different this time. It\u2019s him\u2026but not him.\u2019 Odin was considered one of the wisest of all the Sky Fathers, but at this moment, he could not come to a decision. \u201cWhat should we do?\u201dCaaaaw! Caw!We\u2019ll die this way or that way!Then we need to search for the one who\u2019ll make us die!But we don\u2019t know who that is!Who is it?Don\u2019t know!Who\u2019s most likely?Niflheim?No!They\u2019re weak!Then the one who closed up the heavenly world!It\u2019s him!We can kill him!And the guy we saw before!Let\u2019s kill him!Kill him! Kill him!Odin stroked his chin. Even if they seemed like they were blabbering, Hugin and Munin\u2019s advice opened Odin up to new thought processes, and that was currently the case now. \u201cGetting rid of all the creatures in the way\u2026\u201dThis was the most attractive choice. Even if Odin didn\u2019t kill the being, if only he could somehow manage to make some deal\u2026 Odin gazed below with his eye.\u00a0Whoosh!\u00a0Suddenly, the air rippled around the throne he was sitting in to create a new scene. An image of the One-horned tribe where the Martial King and Yeon-woo appeared.Watching the bustling village preparing for the wedding, Odin narrowed his eye. \u201c\u2026Hmm.\u201d* * *While Asgard made preparations for new movements, there was another godly society that was busy: Olympus. It was a society where Yeon-woo was the current supreme god, and beings of this society still longed for Kronos and Rhea, who were the rulers during Olympus\u2019 golden age.\u201cLord Yeon-woo really appeared?\u201dHermes smiled strangely at Athena\u2019s frantic question. \u201cYup.\u201d\u201cThen why didn\u2019t he come here and is still down there\u2026!\u201d Athena looked very confused.After Yeon-woo appeared, the heavenly world was shut, and the channel to him was still disconnected. As Yeon-woo\u2019s chief apostle, Athena couldn\u2019t help but be flustered. She didn\u2019t know that Yeon-woo had come from the far future after rewinding the wheel, so she was even more confused.Hermes amusedly looked at his sister who was so attached to their young uncle. \u201cDo you know what\u2019s more entertaining?\u201d\u201c\u2026There\u2019s something else?\u201d\u201cLord Kronos is here too.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s because he\u2019s always next to Yeon-woo\u2014!\u201d\u201cIn his complete form.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Athena\u2019s eyes widened as big as saucers.\u201cAnd Lady Rhea is there too.\u201d\u201cT-That means\u2026!\u201d\u201cBoth of them have resurrected completely.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cAnd both of them are currently in the One-horned tribe\u2019s village. What do you think this means?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Athena was silent for a moment. The One-horned tribe was not only where Yeon-woo\u2019s teacher, the Martial King was, but it was where his one and only lover lived. But he had taken his parents there? What else could that mean? Athena jumped up from her seat.Hermes barely contained his laughter. Athena\u2019s face was more serious than ever. She probably had this expression when she\u2019d been standing against Persephone. Her eyes were blazing red. Of course, Hermes didn\u2019t mention it. \u2018It\u2019s more fun to watch from the sidelines. Why should I?\u2019Hermes was the type who slowly savored a delicious meal.\u201cHermes!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat is Olympus?\u201dHermes decided to give Athena the response she wanted. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s Lord Yeon-woo\u2019s umbrella and Lord Kronos and Lady Rhea\u2019s bedrock.\u201d\u201cRight. And the entire One-horned tribe village is moving right now, hm? Then do you think it makes sense for Olympus to do nothing?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d\u201cYes! Exactly!\u201d Athena clenched her fists. She didn\u2019t seem to want to lose, whether it was against the whole group or a particular someone. \u201cHurry up and get ready! We\u2019re heading down there too!\u201d\u201cHehehe. Okay, sister.\u201dHermes\u2019 laughter strangely got on Athena\u2019s nerves, but she didn\u2019t pay any mind to it. Right now, the only thought on her mind was to descend to the lower world.* * *In a thick darkness, hidden figures spoke mysteriously.\u300eDeath.\u300f\u300e\u2026The death that disappeared for a short while has returned even greater than what it used to be.\u300f\u300eIt\u2019s not just great.\u300f\u300eIt\u2019s primitive\u2026\u300f\u300eIt\u2019s original\u2026\u300f\u300eIt\u2019s a dim-witted darkness that\u2019s existed before death.\u300fThis was the conscious territory shared by gods and demons of death who were known to be heretics.\u300eIt\u2019s certain he has finished everything in a timeline we haven\u2019t reached and has returned here to save us.\u300fThe beings in this place already had a guess as to what Yeon-woo had become since the moment he appeared in this timeline. It was because all their powers originated from him.\u300eSo\u2026\u300f\u300eThe king\u300f\u300eThe one who has become the true king.\u300fYeon-woo was no longer the executioner or apostle of the Black King. He was the Black King himself.\u300eLet us go hail him.\u300f\u300eWe shall go greet him.\u300fAnd so the subjects decided to go and see the king who didn\u2019t seek them out.\u300eWe are the residue he has left behind in the universe. It\u2019s only obvious we do.\u300fWith those words, darkness shut.\u00a0Clunk!* * *Many beings of the heavenly world were busy because of Yeon-woo, but there were also those who were silently watching.In the underground of the Tower, also called the Tower\u2019s backend, there was the Unreal World. Someone opened their eyes in the world that existed and did not exist. Although everything was faint and had no shape, the creature seemed to have the dignity and grace of a lion\u2026 Leo.There was a hierarchy among the beings who called themselves stars. To be a star named after the lion, which was the king of beasts, meant he was one of the strongest stars there were. He was one of the two kings who ruled over the stars.\u300eWhat an amusing turn of events.\u300fLeo spent most of his time asleep like most real lions. He was asleep three-fourths of the day, and he was only awake for the other fourth.Some might think he was lazy, but the ferocity the lion constellation showed when he was awake made the other stars tremble in fear, so no one argued with him about it. Rather, they thought the fact that he slept deeply and for so long meant he was just that strong.However, Leo\u2019s sleeping times had become shorter and shorter recently. It was from when he began to observe a certain being.\u300eDim-witted darkness. I see you are trying to live your life in that tiny corner of the universe.\u300fThe being was someone who all stars, all those born in this world, and all living creatures had to know. The being was the universe itself. He was the Black King, who fell into an eternal sleep, and his ego, Cha Yeon-woo.\u300eMarriage?\u300fLeo scoffed.\u300eWhy does such an all-mighty being choose to limit himself to laws of causality\u2026 Does he want to play house in this dream?\u300fLeo lived by the theory that those who were powerful must be worthy of holding such power. The actions Yeon-woo was showing these days were all hard to understand from Leo\u2019s perspective. He seemed ridiculous trying to play house in the dream.If Leo was Yeon-woo and had that much power, he never would\u2019ve used it like that. There was so much Yeon-woo could do with that power, but why was he stopping there? Leo wondered how someone who wasn\u2019t ambitious in the slightest was able to get to such a position.\u300eI want to know he\u2019s thinking.\u300fHowever, Leo\u2019s questions would never be answered just by observing Yeon-woo, so Leo decided to act on it. He would meet Yeon-woo for himself.Of course, it wasn\u2019t the time for stars to fight against the Black King and the Heavenly Demon yet, so he knew it was dangerous, but he thought it would be all right if he approached in good nature. Even if Yeon-woo was hostile, there was no need for Leo to avoid him either\u2026\u300eLet\u2019s go see, shall we\u2026?\u300fLeo slowly stood up. It was his first trip in a long while.And like that, many beings throughout the universe were preparing to attend Yeon-woo\u2019s wedding.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although Agares and Fenrir had caused a ruckus, he didn\u2019t mind it too much. The One-horned tribe was a mischievous group where the tribe members joked about their king\u2019s commands anyway, so the trouble caused by the two was within the realm of \u201cacceptable.\u201dNo, inwardly, the Martial King had even welcomed it. He believed a festival was better the louder it was. But of course, his daughter seemed to be displeased.However, the moment the officiator, Laplace, was attacked, it started to get on his nerves. There was a certain line that shouldn\u2019t be crossed. On this happy day, there should\u2019ve been no screams of horror or violence\u2026!The Martial King slapped his armrest and burst up. He lifted his sleeves, dashing toward the cause of all this, Odin, when something suddenly came at him from his blind spot. It was Denebola, the right hand of the lion constellation, Leo.\u201c\u2026How dare you?!\u201d The Martial King crumpled his face and turned toward Denebola with the blade of his hand. He was also brimming with confidence about himself. He believed even Allforone couldn\u2019t defeat him if they were talking about pure ability, so he considered sneak attacks and sly tricks against him a mockery.Moreover, the Martial King had transcended, and he was a star. He considered himself to be more outstanding than Kronos, who was sitting across from him, so his opponent deserved to be beaten up to death. That was what the Martial King thought.<Eight Extreme Fists - Secret Skill Break Heaven>Clang!\u00a0But the moment his hand clashed with the sword, the Martial King had different thoughts.\u2018She\u2019s holding up? Against\u00a0me?\u2019Even if the Martial King didn\u2019t have the proper time to get into a ready stance, his attack wasn\u2019t one that shouldn\u2019t have been blocked so easily.\u201cI see. The king of martial arts. The name isn\u2019t completely unworthy of you.\u201d Denebola smirked.Suddenly, the Martial King\u2019s expression turned cold. He looked like a doll that couldn\u2019t feel any emotion. It was a rare look on the man who always had an easy smile.\u201cOf course, you\u2019re going to have to give that up too.\u201d Unaware, Denebola continued to speak nonsense and consecutively swing her sword.\u00a0Shing, shing, shing.\u00a0In an instant, tens of trajectories were drawn above the air and fell atop the Martial King\u2019s head. It was reminiscent of a meteor shower.The Martial King only managed to push aside the first three or four and couldn\u2019t even touch the rest.Pft!\u00a0Denebola laughed at the Martial King. She had been somewhat looking forward to it because it was said he was the Black King\u2019s teacher and he was one of the greatest in the Tower, but seeing him stiffen over an attack like this, she thought\u00a0what else did I expect? But really, this was only natural. No matter how strong the Martial King was, it was only a strength that was outstanding in this worldline, #0.Denebola had followed Leo across countless worldlines and swallowed an innumerable amount of civilizations. The Martial King couldn\u2019t even be compared to her. He was just a fish in a small pond. Since she had taught him there was a great ocean outside of the pond he was in, he needed to be grateful to her after death\u2014\u2018What\u2026?\u2019 But Denebola\u2019s thoughts weren\u2019t able to continue any longer. The Martial King, who should\u2019ve been lost at what to do in front of the meteor shower-like attack, had flung himself toward her.After wondering if the Martial King was trying to kill himself because he was so scared, Denebola widened her eyes a moment later. The Martial King\u2026was passing through her attacks. As if he was a ghost. To be exact, the trajectories were deflected, their angles slightly twisted before reaching the Martial King, so he was able to pass through. It was like all the laws of the universe were centered around him. \u2018Impossible!\u2019Denebola tried to retreat at the strange phenomenon that wasn\u2019t logically possible, but the Martial King was already in front of her. He declared, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s going to have to give up something. Your head.\u201dDenebola couldn\u2019t respond because the Martial King already grabbed her face and was planting her to the ground.\u00a0Crash!\u00a0Denebola\u2019s head was half-crushed as blood spurted out. Resisting? Making a counterattack? She didn\u2019t even have the chance to attempt any of that. It was all futile in front of the overwhelming martial arts.But of course, this was something as natural as breathing to the Martial King, so he wasn\u2019t impressed.\u00a0Boom!\u00a0The Martial King immediately jumped into the guest area, leaving the still-breathing Denebola on the ground, as if she wasn\u2019t worth dealing with anymore.Then, the Martial King faced Odin, who stood up like he had been waiting for this moment. Odin said, \u201cYou\u2019re finally here.\u201dWith Odin\u2019s ominous laugh, a horrifying screech spread throughout the entire palace.\u00a0Kiaaaaa!* * *Meanwhile, Phante was looking down at everything from the tip of a building. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d Malach\u2019s archangels and L\u2019Infernals demon kings were busy fighting against the gods of Asgard, but Phante paid it no mind. He murmured, \u201cThere should definitely be someone else behind it.\u201dPhante, who had come from the far future, had incredible judgment and skill, and he was considered to have taken the One-horned tribe into a new golden age. However, his ability didn\u2019t come from wisdom or being able to read people and situations well, but his instinct. He tended to rely on his sharp animal-like gut. During both times of fortune and misfortune, his instinct was always active, showing him the proper path to take.And right now, Phante\u2019s instinct was telling him that Odin, Asgard, couldn\u2019t dare to have dreamed of planning this. There had to be someone else behind it\u2026 However, he didn\u2019t know what it was. He needed to find and eliminate it if he wanted this chaos to settle down\u2026 He didn\u2019t want his little sister\u2019s wedding to be ruined in this way.Just then, something entered Phante\u2019s vision. \u2018\u2026What\u2019s that?\u2019In the middle of the chaotic garden with frantically escaping or fighting guests, someone walked quietly along.\u00a0Step, step\u2026\u00a0His footsteps were lax, as if he wasn\u2019t a part of the pandemonium surrounding him. But no one seemed to think it was strange. Rather, it was more accurate to say no one had noticed him. If Phante hadn\u2019t been carefully searching, he wouldn\u2019t have found the man either.\u2018That\u2019s the guy.\u2019Phante immediately jumped toward him.\u201cHiya!\u201dSwish.\u00a0As he fell to the ground with a mighty cry, the man also stopped and looked up at Phante. The way the man\u2019s long hair flew loose in the wind stood out. Leo, also known as Regulus, widened his eyes in surprise and chuckled good-naturedly. \u201cHahaha! I thought there was only trash here. I guess there\u00a0is\u00a0someone who\u2019s useful.\u201dPhante thought to himself that he was going to crush that arrogant mouth first as he raised his Blood Lightning to the maximum.\u00a0Crash!\u00a0Blood-red lightning crackled with an impressive thunder, falling on top of Leo\u2019s head.Eeeeeerng.\u00a0But Phante felt the back of his neck turn cold. He rapidly twisted to the side, and the area that was a breath\u2019s distance away from him suddenly exploded.\u00a0Boom!\u00a0It was an extraordinary impact that made even his Blood Lightning disappear.Cough.\u00a0Phante was roughly flung back and rolled on the ground.\u201cWow, you evaded that? You look pretty dim, but I guess you have good instinct, huh?\u201dPhante, covered in dust, forced himself to stand. He glowered at the amused Leo. His pride had taken a hit\u2026but it was mentally shocking as well. \u2018He\u2019s\u2026on the same level as Father?\u2019 It was just a single clash\u2014no, Phante hadn\u2019t even been able to counter\u2014but his experience in battle allowed him to quickly realize Leo\u2019s level. The attack just now had only been a warm-up. If the two clashed directly, Phante would without being able to last a few seconds.The thought invaded Phante\u2019s mind. The man was definitely not weaker than the Martial King, who had even become a star. The aura around him even made Phante\u2019s skin prickle. \u2018Where did such a guy\u2026?!\u2019Phante gritted his teeth. Then\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re smiling?\u201d Leo tilted his head, not understanding Phante\u2019s reaction. Of those he faced, their reactions were either one of the two: stiffening in hear, or bowing and swearing submission. It was a natural stance that one should take in front of the king of beasts, the lion, so Leo never found it strange. So it was the first time he was looking at someone grinning ear to ear like they were having the time of their lives.\u201cHahaha! I thought there was no one good enough around to fight against, but I didn\u2019t need to worry!\u201dCrackle! Crash!\u00a0The Blood Lightning surrounding Phante was charged more fully than it had ever been. It was a result of his joy of meeting a strong enemy.<Blood Lightning \u2015 Secret Skill Myriad Lightning>The secret skill that filled the entire world with blood-red lightning and burned it down was opened, and Phante was soon surrounded by a lightning sphere that made it hard to recognize him.\u00a0Crash!\u00a0With every step he took forward, every dash, every flutter of his clothes, the clash of the lightning sphere and the atmosphere made a thunder sound that was deafening. The hazy air and heat was threatening enough to immediately tear apart most transcendents.\u201cWhat a crazy bastard. You take care of him, Algieba.\u201d Leo summoned his left hand because it was clear dealing with this himself would only be a bother.Whoosh!\u00a0The space next to Leo was twisted, and someone stepped out. He was dressed in traditional martial clothing and covered his eyes with a blindfold. He had the opposite image of Leo.\u00a0Creeeaak!\u00a0Algieba\u2019s sleeves flapped and the narrow sword that came out made the sound of nails against glass as it clashed with Myriad Lightning.\u00a0Du du du\u2026While Denebola and Odin fought with the Martial King, and Algieba fought against Phante, Leo scanned the garden, which looked like it wouldn\u2019t be able to be returned to its original state. Then he turned toward the center\u2026 Yeon-woo was looking back at Leo with empty eyes. His pretty bride had already disappeared somewhere else.Leo wasn\u2019t particularly interested in Edora anyway, so he grinned. It was easier without anyone to get in the way. \u201cBlack King. Dim-witted darkness. The chaos before the beginning\u2026and Cha Yeon-woo in the original universe. Right?\u201d\u201cIf I am?\u201d\u201cPahaha! That\u2019s a relief. Do you know how much I wanted to see you? Everyone told me to avoid you and was so concerned that I wanted to see you for myself. So that\u2019s why I came.\u201d Leo raised the corners of his mouth. \u201cYou can be happy. I don\u2019t usually move. I almost never get up actually. That\u2019s how much I wanted to see you.\u201d\u201cYes. Indeed. I\u2019m happy.\u201d\u201cOoh! You too? Why? Am I so famous that even you know me? Hm? I thought I\u2019ve been hiding my name well though.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about your name.\u201d Yeon-woo\u2019s smile seemed cold, like a predator that had a prey right in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m just happy that a gift for my teacher came on its own feet.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 63": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Second Life RankerCH ss - 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySide Story Chapter 40 - Star Fragment (6)About a week after Min Chae-young started following Sesha to school\u2026\u00a0Plop.\u00a0Kronos placed a document on a table. Rhea and Ananta soon looked to see what Kronos had brought. On the document, they saw someone\u2019s biography as well as three pictures.\u201cAre you doing some undercover background investigation work on the side? You seemed to always say that you didn\u2019t have time for anything since you were so busy looking after Ye-eun.\u201dHearing Rhea\u2019s snide remark, Kronos lightly sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cLook closely.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d Wondering what her husband was up to, Rhea looked at the document closely. Soon, her eyes grew wide.<Son Jae-won>Client\u2019s person of interest.Unable to find date of birth or any birth records associated with this person of interest.The person of interest went missing after going off to school fourteen years ago.Personality was introspective and quiet. He did not seem to have many friends. From a young age, he was offered a government title as a \u2018national genius treasure\u2019, but his parents did not accept the offer.He is considered a person of high interest in an unsolved string of murders that occurred during that period. He is assumed to be either the perpetrator or a victim.<Son Ji-ho>Son Jae-won\u2019s father.Date of birth is unknown.Last seen fourteen years ago at a corner store purchasing some beer before going missing.He was fond of singing and was known to possess an outgoing personality.He was the main vocalist and leader of the popular band called \u2018Will\u2019. \u2018Will\u2019 is no longer together.Unable to find any other family background information.<Seo Eun-young>Son Jae-won\u2019s mother.Date of birth is unknown.Nine years ago, she told her friend, Mrs. Gu, that she was planning on visiting her relatives. She was never heard from again.We were told that she possessed a warm and pleasant personality.Along with her husband, she was active in \u201cWill\u201d as the sub-vocal and main guitarist.Unable to find any other family background information.The name \u2018Son Jae-won\u2019 was at the top of the document, and below it followed the names \u2018Son Ji-ho\u2019 and \u2018Seo Eun-young\u2019.\u201cWe looked everywhere for the guy that Chae-young mentioned, but we didn\u2019t get anywhere, so I employed an investigator.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cIt seems something strange is going on.\u201dAt first, when Rhea accepted Chae-young\u2019s request, Kronos thought that it would not be too difficult to find the boy called Son Jae-won. Though he felt a sense of unease, if the boy lived as a human on Earth, Kronos and Rhea would inevitably be able to locate and find him. If they released their powers for a moment to look through the entire planet, they would be able to locate the person of interest within an instant.However, their thought of conducting such a simple act of search-and-locate quickly crumbled. No matter how many times they scanned the entirety of Earth, they could not locate the being named Son Jae-won. They investigated every being that possessed such a name and even those who possessed it in the past, but they had no luck.Thinking that something was off, Kronos rewound the \u2018wheel\u2019 to go back in time to view the vestige thoughts left by Son Jae-won while Rhea followed along to shadow Son Jae-won\u2019s movements. And after reviewing all the remnants left by Son Jae-won in the past, they concluded that Son Jae-won was not a simple figure.Min Chae-young had stated that Son Jae-won always arrived at school early, was relatively quiet, and was unassuming. However, what Kronos and Rhea found did not match Chae-young\u2019s description.\u201cYou see it too, right? There\u2019s something different about that Son Jae-won.\u201dAround the time when Min Chae-young was killed, Son Jae-won seemed to have changed. Not only did Son Jae-won seek revenge on the stepfather who had killed Chae-young, but he started to also resolve the various injustices and criminal cases that had occurred during his contemporary period. It was as if he had become some sort of US comic book superhero.Kronos and Rhea also recalled that there were many corpses popping up all over Korea during that time. It had caused quite a commotion back then. In the end, no one was able to find the culprit behind all the corpses, and the serial killings of that time from the serial killer had suddenly stopped. In the end, nothing was concluded or resolved.Rhea, who was in the hospital at that time due to illness, did not pay much attention to what had been going on. She never thought that Son Jae-won was behind everything that had occurred during that time.\u201cSo, on a hunch, I employed someone to investigate everyone close to Son Jae-won. This is what they found.\u201d Kronos crossed his arms and narrowed his eyes. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem like something is up?\u201d\u201cOh, Son Jae-won was the child from the parents who led the band \u2018Will\u2019\u201d.When she arrived on Earth for the first time, Rhea found that her age group was very interested in the band called \u2018Will\u2019. Before marrying Kronos, she recalled going to a few of their concerts. She did not expect to see or hear of them again, especially in this way. Rhea also recalled that the love and marriage of the two members of \u2018Will\u2019 had been a popular story in the tabloids back then. Moreover, the band stopped performing ever since the two members\u2019 marriage.\u201cFor there to be no other family information\u2026 Isn\u2019t that unexpected?\u201d\u201cDo you know what\u2019s more interesting? Even though they were so popular, no one seems to be able to recall how they looked.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re right.\u201dRhea tried recalling their faces but could not do so easily. She soon nodded her head.Whether a blessing or a curse, once one reached divine status, one lost the sense of obliviousness. All memories that a soul experienced and piled up within one\u2019s unconscious could be reviewed whenever one wanted. Everything one saw and observed remained as detailed as a video clip, and one would be able to recall the feelings, inner thoughts, sensations, and general thoughts one had at that time. Hence, all memories that Rhea possessed when she was the \u2018god Rhea\u2019 existed within her soul.However, strangely, Rhea could not recall the faces of Will\u2019s vocalist and guitarist whom she had seen when she went to their concerts with Kronos. It was as if her memories had been covered by strong sunlight.\u201cThe child named Son Jae-won\u2026 It\u2019s clear that his disappearance has something to do with his parents. Son Jae-won disappeared first, and then the other two disappeared. Even the other members of the band don\u2019t seem to know anything about their whereabouts.\u201d This was Kronos\u2019 conclusion.Rhea sighed. It was difficult enough trying to find out what or who the Stars were. Now, they had to contend with another difficult matter. \u201c\u2026Do you think it has something to do with Chae-young\u2019s Star Fragment?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. But we can\u2019t say there\u2019s no association at all, right?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not make hasty assumptions. We\u2019ll find out more as we dig deeper, so let\u2019s keep all this a secret from Chae-young for the time being.\"\u201cYes, I agree.\u201d Rhea nodded.* * *\u2018I-It isn\u2019t going to break, right?\u2019 Min Chae-young looked at her adorable hand, which was clenching her index finger, with a trembling gaze.\u201cAbubu!\u201d A one-year-old baby, still unable to speak, babbled. Its babbling words struck Min Chae-young\u2019s heart. She wondered how in the world could there be such a cute and adorable child! Sesha referred to this child as her \u2018youngest aunt\u2019. Maybe it received the title as youngest because her grandfather and grandmother gave birth to it recently?Although Sesha grumbled that her genealogy was terribly twisted because of it, Sesha made sure to carefully care for her young aunt.\u201c\u2026Auntie pooped again. I need to change her diaper.\u201d\u201cAbububu!\u201d\u201cAww! You can't eat that! No, no!\u201d\u201cMilk?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cMilk!\u201dFor a long time, Sesha busily wrestled with the baby. When she finished changing the baby\u2019s diapers, Sesha was exhausted.\u201cUh\u2026 Am I a niece or a nanny?\u201d Sesha lamented as she lay half-strewn across a chair. It seemed that Sesha had lost half her soul. As the youngest sibling in the Cha household, the baby was fierce and lively. So every time Sesha met her aunt, she felt like she was running out of power. Regardless of whatever Sesha felt, Sesha\u2019s aunt just loved being with Sesha. Even now, the baby was standing up with her diaper on and shaking Sesha to and fro.\u201cHey! Niece! Niece!\u201d\u201c\u2026There\u2019s something odd about the way she talks.\u201d\u201cNiece!\u201d\u201c\u2026Why does her way of speaking remind me of father and uncle?\u201d Sesha looked at her youngest aunt with a strange expression on her face, but her youngest aunt was energetically playing around in a good mood.Min Chae-young stared at Sesha, and then she quickly said something to prevent Sesha from falling asleep due to exhaustion.\u300cSo-yeong.\u300d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u300cSorry to bother you while you\u2019re taking a break, but can you tell me if it\u2019s possible to add a stroke to this part of the magic circle?\u300d\u201cAh, that\u2026\u201dA small magic circle appeared on Min Chae-young\u2019s open palm. It was a basic magic circle consisting of only four strokes.Currently, Min Chae-young was learning magic from Sesha so that she could at least protect herself if she should fall in danger. Moreover, Min Chae-young was deeply interested in magic. During her lifetime, her family\u2019s circumstances were not so good, so she was not able to study very effectively, but the situation was completely different now. Additionally, studying magic felt like she was growing wings that freed her from oppression while giving her true \u2018freedom\u2019. Everything she learned was interesting and new.\u2018Really\u2026 She has talent. Perhaps it has to do with her Star Fragment or whatever it is she has.\u2019 After giving her explanation, Sesha smiled softly as she saw Min Chae-young\u2019s eyes twinkling. Though Chae-young was only at the level of creating simple magic circles, it was still absurd that someone who had only studied magic for a week was able to accomplish so much. To this extent, Min Chae-young exemplified excellent in her understanding, insight, and memorization of magic.Even Min Chae-young herself was surprised by her rapid development. When she was alive, Min Chae-young felt that she was not very bright.Sesha could vaguely guess the reason behind why Chae-young felt this way. On another note, Sesha was feeling a sense of crisis because of Min Chae-young, whose potential had only been partially revealed.When Sesha occasionally explained the basics of magic, Chae-young often threw out sharp questions that challenged Sesha. It was as if Chae-young knew what parts were the most important. Sesha was often surprised by Chae-young\u2019s pointed questions.\u2018If things go on like this, I\u2019ll reach the end of my knowledge soon. That can\u2019t happen! I need to study up and not get overtaken!\u2019Thanks to this, Sesha was motivated to learn and practice magic more, which she had been lazy about previously. They became well-intentioned competitors.\u201cIn the case of this stroke, it goes through the central circuit, right? Depending on the inclination of the stroke, there is a slight difference in function in terms of function\u2026!\u201dWhile Sesha was giving her explanation\u2026\u201c\u2026Huh? What\u2019s going on?\u201d Sesha blinked after seeing that the magic circle was not budging. It was not just the magic circle. All the mana around them\u2026 The natural mana and the flow of the mana stream all stopped. It was as if the mana was being held back by someone.At that moment\u2026Ring![Connecting\u2026]A message that Sesha was all too familiar with popped up in her mind. This was a system message. The system that Yeon-woo had shut down began to operate once more. Why was the system suddenly becoming operational\u2026\u300cS-So-yeong! Something strange is happening!\u300dSesha urgently looked back at Min Chae-young. A different message was floating in front of Min Chae-young.[New registrant found!][Data is registered.][Loading. Please wait a moment.]Since this development was completely unexpected, Sesha could not help but be caught off guard.[Connection complete.][The server is opening.][The backed-up player data has been confirmed.]\u2026[The system will restart!]Then, as soon as the message that her connection was complete popped up, Sesha jumped up as a thought passed by her mind. \u201cChae-young, wait here for a second!\u201d\u300cSo-yeong!\u300dMin Chae-young was startled, wondering what was going on, so she called out to Sesha, but Sesha had already left the room and was heading downstairs. And, at the place she ran down to, Sesha saw the face of the person who she longed to see.\u201cUncle!\u201dYeon-woo waved as he happily looked upon Sesha. He was carrying something in his arms. It seemed to be a present for Sesha.However, for Sesha, there was something more time sensitive and important that she needed to convey to her uncle.\u201cPlease! Please do something about Laplace!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Incheon Airport.Yeon-woo adjusted his clothes as he walked across the airport terminal.A shaved head with a neatly arranged military uniform. A Korean flag shined brightly on his arm, indicating his belonging to a military contingent.After organizing his backpack, he made a phone call.*Click*\u201cSergeant Cha reporting in from Korea.\u201d[Understood. Take it easy and try to comfort your parents while you are there.]\u201cThank you.\u201dAfter expressing his gratitude, Yeon-woo ended the call and put his phone down.Coming back from a three-year stay in Africa, he felt much warmer and peaceful in Korea than in Africa.However, Yeon-woo\u2019s mind was in distress.With a cigarette in his mouth, he took out something from his pocket. It was a letter he received during his mission.The word \u2018Obituary\u2019 was written on the letter. His younger brother had disappeared five years ago, and this obituary was now notifying him of his brother\u2019s death.* \u00a0*\u00a0 *The funeral had ended.His brother\u2019s ashes were scattered at the sea in front of Taejongdae, his brother\u2019s favorite place.Yeon-woo hadn\u2019t heard any news him during the last five years, but now he had returned to him inside a cold urn.\u201cThis is what he was holding when the body was found.\u201dThe person who discovered his brother\u2019s body took out a small box.Yeon-woo opened it with care. The box contained two things.One was a faded photograph, and the other\u2026.\u201c\u2026A pocket watch?\u201dIn the photograph, his brother was in front of a shabby looking house, wearing some kind of medieval armor, next to some people with unusual appearances.Was he filming a movie somewhere? He thought.Yeon-woo had roamed around all sorts of places, but he had never seen anything like this.\u201cUhm\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dAs Yeon-woo was unconsciously touching his brother\u2019s figure in the photograph, the man\u2019s interjection brought him back to his senses.At the same time, a question came to his mind, but it wasn\u2019t an appropriate place to ask it, so Yeon-woo only thanked the man and returned home.* \u00a0*\u00a0 *He quietly looked at the photograph in his room. In it, his brother was still smiling.They were twins. Born with identical faces and features, and yet they were so different.His brother was a model student, but weak and introverted. He enjoyed reading books and watching movies.Yeon-woo, on the other hand, was very extroverted. He was also athletic, thus he applied both to PE as a major, and to the military academy.People around them were surprised by how different they could be.Nonetheless, the two of them had always stuck together.The little brother would hold onto his scatterbrained brother and teach him how to study, and the older brother would tell his brother lying in bed, about how fun and exciting things were outside, several times a day. Both of them were so devoted to one another.But then, with only one day before the CSAT, his younger brother had disappeared.And so many things had changed since then.His mother, who was originally suffering from a chronic disease, had passed away. After searching for his brother for over two years to no avail, Yeon-woo had given up on everything. He enlisted in the military as a non-commissioned officer, volunteered himself to be dispatched to Africa and left Korea.It was at that time that he became less of an extrovert and grew to be more cynical.From that point on, contact with Korea had naturally been cut off. He thought he would never return to Korea, ever again.But now, five years later, his brother had returned to him as an obituary letter.\u201c\u2026.\u201dAt first, he had been mad at his brother, who disappeared without a word and now had become like this. The first thing that had come to his mind was that his brother was so self-indulgent.But as the funeral began, he started to feel empty, as if his soul was being torn apart. And by the time he had scattered his brother\u2019s ashes in Taejongdae, his heart had been bursting at the seams.He wanted to ask what had happened to his brother, what had he been doing, and why did he have to return like this.But his brother in the photograph did not say a word. Just like how he hadn\u2019t said anything during the past five years.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dYeon-woo put the photograph down and checked on the pocket watch.It was worn out and badly thumbed, as if it were more than a hundred years old.Only \u2018XII\u2019, the roman numeral for 12, and the hour hand was left of the watch, and it was not working. He took it to a jeweler to repair, but the only answer he got was that it was too rusty to fix.\u2018This is the present that I gave my brother back then.\u2019When they were 19 years old, the year they became third graders in high school, the brothers gave each other a present on their birthday. The younger brother gave him a book for him to study, and Yeon-woo gave his brother a pocket watch to wish him luck on his CSAT.This was that pocket watch.Yeon-woo grabbed the pocket watch, it slipped and clung perfectly into his palm. It was just the right size.\u2018I knew it.\u2019He remembered how he wandered around every jeweler, looking for a pocket watch that would perfectly fit in one hand.Then Yeon-woo flipped the watch over, and on the backside saw a name written in cursive on one corner.J. W. CAH\u201cWhoa! I really needed a watch. Thanks bro. Compared to a digital watch, this is way cooler.\u201d\u201cPuhaha! How is it? Your big brother\u2019s got a nice fashion sense.\u201cBut what is this written on here? Looks like J. W. is my name, but CAH? *pft*\u201d\u201cHmm? That\u2019s our family name, \u2018Cha\u2019.\u201d\u201cHow is this \u2018Cha\u2019? It\u2019s spelled CHA!\u201d\u201cWhat? Dammit! Give it to me.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m gonna talk to the guy from the jeweler to fix it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s OK, don\u2019t bother. I\u2019ll take it. From now on, I\u2019ll just write CAH whenever I write my name.\u201dThen, the younger brother confidently put the pocket watch into his pocket.After that, the younger brother proudly wrote \u2018CAH\u2019 as his name when he went to apply for a passport.At that time, Yeon-woo had felt both sorry and grateful at the same time.Yeon-woo chuckled as he recalled his past memory.While he was running his hand over the pocket watch, he pressed on a knob by accident.*Click*\u2018Huh?\u2019Wasn\u2019t it broken? He thought.The knob slid inside the watch.Then suddenly\u2026.*Tic* *Tac*The hour hand that seemed to be stopped started to run.To my older brother who will listen to this sometime in the future.A familiar voice was heard inside his head.\u201c\u2026!\u201dYeon-woo subconsciously sprang up to his feet.It was a voice he hadn\u2019t heard in five years. It was a voice he thought he would never hear again. It was his brother\u2019s voice.*Thump* *Thump*His heart started to pound like crazy.By the time you hear this, I guess I will be already dead.It was not a hallucination.Yeon-woo checked if there was a recorder inside the pocket watch, but it was nowhere to be found.The voice was clearly ringing inside his head.How is this possible? He thought.I am sorry. Everyone had a hard time because of me, didn\u2019t you? I just wanted to find a medicine for mom. I thought I could return home soon, but time had gone by too quickly.\u201cWhat?\u201dIt was at this moment when his eyes got strained.*Whoosh*Suddenly, in front of his eyes, a flood of his brother\u2019s memories passed by like a panorama.It, was a diary.* \u00a0*\u00a0 *Oct 9th, 2013.A strange text message arrived on my phone. It said it will fulfill whatever I wish for. Nothing else was written in it, only buttons to decide whether I want to join or not.Normally, I would have ignored the message, but I couldn\u2019t help thinking about mom in the hospital looking more and more haggard everyday.So I pressed the \u2018yes\u2019 button just in case my mom would be cured.Nothing had changed.I felt very hollow. In the end, it was just a prank.But from that day on, I started having a strange dream.It was a dream about climbing what seemed like an infinitely tall, 99-story tower.Oct 12th, 2013.It was definitely not a dream!Everything was clear. It was a real world.A world where not only different races like elves and dwarves, but also monsters like orcs, trolls and dragons exist, and a world where several universes and dimensions intersect in one place.The tower is sitting in the middle, waiting for people from all over the world to climb it. The moment when a person breaks through the ninety ninth floor, he or she will become a god, or that\u2019s what I heard someone saying.People pointed at the tower and called it,The Tower of the Sun God,Obelisk.But that doesn\u2019t mean a thing to me. Instead, the only thing that matters is that somewhere in this tower exists an elixir that can cure all diseases, the Panacea.With that in my hand, I could save mom from her illness.Oct 28th, 2013I was able to team up with some like-minded friends and started climbing up the tower.Still, it wasn\u2019t easy at all.We had to kill all sorts of monsters, and each and every time we faced mortal dangers. This place, it may look like a game, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s reality. If you die, everything is over.But my teammates and I are talented. Back in reality, my far-from-well body always caused worries for my family, but in this world, through runes I was able to see the light.We were told that we were the first team to ever break through the first ten floors within four days.Since then, I began to seriously consider.I would not be able to live both my life in the real world and in the tower at the same time.Nov 9th, 2013I made up my mind.I tried explaining to my brother about this place. But whenever I faced him, the words wouldn\u2019t come out of my mouth. Do I say, \u2018there\u2019s a world named The Tower, and I\u2019m trying to salvage some medicine in there\u2019?But my brother, even though he looks gruff on the outside, he has such a warm heart on the inside. What would he say? I bet he would volunteer to take my place instead.That cannot happen.So in the end, I decided to leave home. They will be looking for me, but it will only take about half a year.I\u2019m sure I can find the elixir by that time. And just like that, I disconnected myself from the real world.Dec 1st, 2013My teammates and I named ourselves \u2018Arthia\u2019.Arthia is the best in every single way, both in teamwork, and in individual skills. We are at the top of our game.We then rapidly broke through several floors, and there is no one in the tower who doesn\u2019t know our name.I might be able to get a hold of the Elixir much faster than I thought.\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Sep 7th, 2014Our climbing speed has slowed down. I thought I would only need half a year, but now I might need one more year.Nov 11th, 2014We had a fight with some high ranking clans who regards us as an eyesore. We now have more obstacles to overcome.\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Feb 31st, 2015Negotiations have broken down.A war has begun.\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Jul 2nd, 2015The alliance of clans we fought against has just collapsed.Arthia, which originally started with only twelve people, has now grown into one of the ten largest clans, all of our teammates have become high rankers.And I, Arthia\u2019s leader, have risen up to ninth place. It is said that I\u2019m the fastest ranker to ever get into the top ten.However, I can\u2019t just stand here and celebrate.Because of the war, we haven\u2019t had time to find the elixir. We need to pick up our speed and climb the tower.\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Mar 4th, 2016I\u2019ve found someone I love.\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Sep 19th, 2016Another war has begun.An enmity between Arthia who wants to climb higher and other high ranking clans who want to maintain the status quo has arisen. I\u2019ve been trying my best to persuade them, but it isn\u2019t easy.To make matters worse, some of our teammates agree with their ideas. They just can\u2019t voice out their opinions because they are worried.Even though I was fully aware of this, I pressed on our clan to continue climbing up the tower, so we couldn\u2019t avoid conflicts.But even now, time keeps flowing.I feel like I\u2019m going crazy.\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Jan 2nd, 2017Arthia is now ranked in fifth place. However, the war hasn\u2019t ended yet, and everyone is too tired.\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Jun 6th, 2017We found a traitor in our clan.We were able to kill him before he could rise up, but it was enough to cause a rift amongst our teammates. Everyone has started to distrust one another.Our members are leaving the clan one by one.Jul 1st, 2017My body feels heavier.I have been poisoned.Oct 30th, 2017Half of our members have already left the clan. We keep on losing battles, and now we don\u2019t dare to climb to higher floors. I tried asking all around to look for the elixir, but I couldn\u2019t obtain any kind of information about it.And my body is slowly breaking down.Nov 1st, 2017The person I loved left me with a dagger stabbed into my heart.I was barely able to block it with my skill, but I was unable to continue suppressing the poison. My body is starting to rot.Dec 30th, 2017I miss my brother.\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Feb 1st, 2018I am the only one left in Arthia.Why did things go so wrong?Was it because I trusted people too much? Or was it because I was too absorbed in satisfying my own needs, and forgot to look after my teammates?Or else\u2026.Was it because I left my family?Feb 28th, 2018On the last day of February, I finally got my hands on the elixir.Now I need to find a way to send it home, but there\u2019s no way I can. I can\u2019t leave the Tower even if I want to, I\u2019m being surrounded by other people.Maybe they think I will treat my poison with it if I leave.Everyone is coming to kill me. There was no one left by my side.Now I know.The fact that there is only one person I can trust.But I cannot show them my weakness.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He felt like the experiences that his brother had gone through on \u2018that side\u2019 were being portrayed right in front of his eyes.Then Yeon-woo slowly rewound the knob.*Click*To my older brother who will listen to this sometime in the future. By the time you hear this\u2026.His brother\u2019s recorded voice started speaking again from the beginning.After that, Yeon-woo once again rewound the knob.By the time you hear this\u2026.In the same place, Yeon-woo rewound the watch over and over again.And every time, he could hear his brother\u2019s voice inside his head.The same voice, the same tone, the same diary.[Starting the succession process]At that moment, a small screen popped up under his retina.Interface system.This meant he was successfully connected to The Tower.And then, his body began to change.*Swoosh*Something was wriggling inside his lower abdomen. He felt as if there was a snake curled up in his stomach and it was raising its head up.It was a refreshing feeling, and yet, at the same time, it felt as if a weird seed was sprouting inside him.It was mana. The basic element that constitutes the foundation of the world. It is also the power that people from other worlds and The Tower dealt with.*Bang*A cluster of mana exploded inside him. Through an unknown path, it spread out in all directions throughout his body.He felt something was changing on the inside.And then,*Crackle* *Crunch*His body started to twist and convulse, followed by a fierce pain as if he were being torn apart.He felt like his body was being disassembled and pierced by countless needles.During military school, his tolerance against torture had been trained, but this was completely different.Even so, Yeon-woo held tight onto his sanity. Not even a groan came out from his mouth.He was sitting in place as he kept rewinding the pocket watch and listened to his brother\u2019s voice again and again.By the time you\u2026.His skeletal frame was being altered. The joints in his body were readjusting, and his muscles turned soft and then hard again. A black substance was secreted out from his torn skin, which gave off a bad odor.All the impurities in his body had been eliminated, and his muscles and skeleton had been refined.*Crack* *Crack*He was in such a terrible pain, but this was nothing compared to what his brother had gone through.And then, what seemed like an endless process finally came to its end.[Awakening finished][Your awakening process is incomplete.

The memories of when they were so happy after successfully clearing one of the hardest floors. The memories of when they stood back to back, fighting their war.The memories of himself drenched in blood, feeling worn out. The memories of when he kissed his love for the first time\u2026. The memories of when he wept aloud because of her betrayal. And the memories of when he walked alone towards his enemies that were flooding in like water.As the memories were being embedded into his head, Yeon-woo could the feel happiness, sadness and all the other emotions his brother had felt.Inside, Yeon-woo had become his brother.And at that moment, when everything had ended,\u201c\u2026.\u201d[Player: Yeon-woo Cha]Trait: Cold-bloodedStrength: 10 \u00a0\u00a0Dexterity: 15\u00a0\u00a0 Health: 12 \u00a0\u00a0Magic Power: 21Skills: Draconic Eyes, Sense Strengthening, ForesightYeon-woo awoke from the overflowing thoughts. As he opened his eyes, a transparent panel popped up right in front of his eyes.\u2018It was true. Everything.\u201dHe was hoping for it to be a lie. He would have prefered everything to be a dream or an illusion, but it wasn\u2019t.It was reality.Yeon-woo\u2019s expression sunk.Now he knew about everything his brother had gone through. Who put his brother to death, and the reason why his brother had to return like that after five years.The Tower was a place that could turn someone into a god.But to Yeon-woo, it was nothing more than a lawless area where everyone bites at each other\u2019s throat.And his brother was bitten by the starving demons inside that place.If that\u2019s the case,\u201cI will pay you back.\u201dFollowing their rules,\u201cEqually to you all.\u201dYeon-woo was given his brother\u2019s abilities as they were.A player. He had acquired the minimum requirement to climb the tower.And now it was time for him to come forward.Sadness disappeared from his eyes.\u201c\u2026.\u201dOnly cold fury remained.* \u00a0*\u00a0 *Yeon-woo silently stared at the transparent panel that was in front of his eyes.\u201cSo this is the \u2018Status window\u2019?\u201dThe status window was further classified into three tabs: Traits, Attributes, Skills.Traits showed the player\u2019s personality or talents.The first trait his brother had obtained was \u2018Psychometry\u2019, the ability to communicate with his surroundings.His brother was able to overcome many dangers by the using his Psychometry to communicate with objects or skills.In addition to that, Attributes showed a quantification of a player\u2019s capabilities, and Skills showed the standardized skills that players could use inside the tower.\u2018It\u2019s just like a game\u2019When talking about Obelisk, his brother had said \u201cit may look like a game, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s reality\u201d.Now he understood why.\u2018Currently, I have Cold-blooded as my trait.\u2019[Trait: Cold-blooded]An ability to maintain rationality in any situation. Shows great immunity to mind control and brainwash class curses.This was a talent Yeon-woo originally possessed.It seems that it was created based on his training as a professional soldier.A power that helps him keep a cool-headed judgement in chaotic situations and command his army on the frontlines.\u2018It\u2019s not bad.\u2019No, it wasn\u2019t just \u2018not bad\u2019.It was perfect.It was very important to have a card in his hand that could help him protect himself in a world full of bizarre magics and skills.\u2018Only, my attributes are too weak.\u2019Even though he had gone through an awakening as a player and his body had also been improved, he was still just a normal human.On average, his attributes were all below 20.For climbing The Tower where all sorts of monsters existed, he was too weak.But it was no surprise.He had no idea how to handle mana, and he wasn\u2019t particularly skilled at anything. Also, his knowledge on the concept of skills was too scarce.The only thing he could rely on were his instincts that had been honed by war.So was the Skill tab.[Draconic Eyes(\uf9c4\u9b54\u773c)]Eyes of a dragon. Sees through the truth. Can partially peek into an object or person\u2019s abilities.[Sense Strengthening]The five senses are greatly improved.[Foresight] (Special)Can see a certain amount of time into the future.His Draconic Eyes were the only vestige his brother had left behind for him through the succession process in the pocket watch.\u2018Jeong-woo was able to make contract with an ancient dragon(\u53e4\u9f8d) on the 11th floor by chance. Is this something left from that encounter?\u2019The draconic species(\uf9c4\u7a2e) are arrogant and ferocious by nature, yet are also beings that seek the truth.It seems his brother had been partly exposed to their nature, and acquired the eyes that can peek through the truth.But how big of a help would this be was yet to be known.\u2018Seems like Sense Strengthening was generated according to my Trait.\u201dIt was a skill that allowed him to arbitrarily control his five senses, that are sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste.Yeon-woo liked this skill the most.It\u2019s unpredictable what could happen in a battlefield.He might have to locate enemies that are out of sight, or he might have to trace out a faint smell of oil. There was also a time when he had to listen to the distant footsteps of the enemy.If he could handle such senses freely, it would be very helpful in his attempt to climb up the tower.\u2018What bothers me the most is this one,\u2019Yeon-woo\u2019s eyes were fixed on the last skill.\u2018Foresight.\u2019Yeon-woo looked at the pocket watch in his hand.\u2018Is it because of this?\u201dSkills were given according to players\u2019 Traits, but sometimes they were given according to the player\u2019s environment or their most precious object.Especially skills with the word \u2018special\u2019 attached behind, it\u2019s safe to say that it was a skill of his own.\u2018OK. For now, let\u2019s just do it.\u2019Yeon-woo took a deep breath.It was clear that compared to other players, he was starting on a better foothold thanks to his brother\u2019s help.But even so, there was a long way ahead of him.The ones who brought his brother to his death are the strongest amongst all rankers.They had grown stronger and stronger throughout the course of several years, some even hundreds of years.He had a long way to go if he wanted to catch up with those people.The image of his brother in the photograph came back to his mind.\u2018You only wanted me to find the elixir and live the rest of my life peacefully, but\u2026.\u2019He clenched his fist, causing his veins to stick out.\u2018I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t think I can just let things go.\u2019* \u00a0*\u00a0 *Yeon-woo proceeded to sort out his personal affairs.[Sergeant Cha! what are you talking about? You\u2019re leaving the army all of a sudden?]He heard the commander\u2019s furious voice over the phone.It was no surprise.Upon hearing about his brother\u2019s death, the commander had sent him back to Korea to allow him to get himself sorted out, but now he was applying to be discharged without any prior notice. If Yeon-woo were the commander, he would also be mad.Yeon-woo, however, did not give any specific excuses.[Did something happen? Or did you have any complaints? If you did, just tell me. If \u2018Cain\u2019 leaves, what am I supposed t\u2026! ]\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dYeon-woo hung up the phone right after saying that.His phone rang again, but he turned off the phone and threw it into a garbage can on the street.The commander had cared for him like a son, so he had to cut off the connection even more adamantly.The only thing left was his house, but he also put it out on the real estate market.Anyway, the house had been unused since he got dispatched, and now there was no reason to leave it any longer.He didn\u2019t want to have a place to come back.With the money he had, he bought several stuff.He filled his newly purchased backpack with some basic clothes and as many combat rations as he could; Equipped himself with dozens of knives that he used back in the army and some tools for survival like medical kits.He once thought about buying firearms and bombs from the black market, but soon shook off the idea.\u2018The Tower is a place that was built to test a player\u2019s skills. It\u2019s better to avoid such things. Besides, if I can\u2019t continuously supply myself with ammunition it\u2019s just going to be cumbersome.\u2019And once everything was ready, Yeon-woo came out to a lonesome park early in the morning.He was wearing jeans and a black hoodie with his hood drawn over his eyes, and he carried a backpack full of luggage on his right shoulder. He had already burned the uniform and the bag he used to carry before coming out.\u2018Considering the time difference between Obelisk and the real world, \u00a0is it about a week after the last round began?\u2019To enter The Tower, he had to go through this one place first.The tutorial.The place to test players who want to enter The Tower. It was disadvantageous to enter such a place a week after it had already started.But Yeon-woo still decided to enter during this period.\u2018Players who start late are also given advantages. The more I catch up with the front runners, the more points I get, and there\u2019s also a hidden piece that is only given to latecomers. \u00a0Moreover,\u2019Yeon-woo\u2019s eye let out a bleak glow.\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s around this time that \u2018that guy\u2019 shows up.\u201dAs Yeon-woo organized his plans step by step in his head,*Click*He wound the knob of his brother\u2019s pocket watch backwards.Then, a cluster of lights spread in the middle of the park, and a shadow suddenly sprang up.The shadow swirled around and formed a lump.A door(\u9580).It was a gateway to the world where The Tower was located.Yeon-woo stepped inside the gate without any hesitation. His eyes looked colder than ever.\u201cFrom now on,\u201d\u2018I will make sure to let the people beyond this gate know who they messed up with.\u2019\u201cI am Jeong-woo Cha.\u201dAnd so, the gate closed.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He felt dizzy as if he was going through a high-altitude flight.[Your trait \u2018Cold-blooded\u2019 has helped you maintain composure]He felt something wriggling inside his body, holding the previously spinning world straight. The motion sickness soon subsided.Yeon-woo was able to look around more comfortably.He found himself in a passage that ran all the way in a straight line.The walls were made of hard stone, and the ceiling was studded with stones emitting light at regular intervals.But overall, the light was too dim, so he could only see things two meters ahead.Beyond that was all darkness.\u2018I\u2019m really in\u2019Yeon-woo clenched his fists. It was the same scenery he saw from the diary.The Tower serves both as a gateway and as a trial to test the participants that wish to become a god. Naturally, The Tower refuses to accept anybody and everybody, so the trial takers have to prove themselves worthy.The place to test such qualifications is the tutorial, often called \u2018floor 0\u2019.\u2018Beyond this place, are the people who hurt Jeong-woo.\u2019Yeon-woo that, just by closing his eyes, he could recall the numerous scenes he had seen in the diary, the ones who had betrayed his brother and drove him to death.But he didn\u2019t get agitated. \u00a0He kept his head as cool as he could.\u2018Just wait a little. I\u2019ll be there soon.\u2019To enter the tower, the first thing he had to do was to pass the tutorial with a high score.It couldn\u2019t just be a high score.\u2018An overwhelmingly high score. I have to take the first place.\u2019Of course, it wasn\u2019t going to be easy.The Tower is connected to numerous dimensions, spaces and worlds, and among them, only those who are highly capable have the chance to participate as players.Yeon-woo could also be considered strong if only looking at his planet Earth.But the universe was infinitely wide, and so were the strong.Yeon-woo, who had focused only on physical abilities and instinctive senses, had many weak points compared to the already existing players. If he tried to get through the tutorial like this, he would be dead without even being able to take a few steps.However,\u2018The tutorial, at the same time, is a place where I can obtain that kind of qualification.\u2019His brother have had a very weak body before climbing the tower. Nevertheless, he proved himself by passing the tutorial, and ended up achieving the incredible feat of reaching sixth place in the rankings within the shortest amount of time ever.The tutorial isn\u2019t just a test for physical abilities. It tests various aspects such as players\u2019 talent, judgement, agility, resourcefulness, and decisiveness. It summed up the results, and rated the players.Naturally, there\u2019s always have been a number of deaths in the process.No, most of them had been overconfident in the little capabilities they had and rushed into the tutorial, only to end up dead.Fortunately, Yeon-woo was aware of the dangers of the tutorial. And he was also aware of the value this place had.\u2018Hidden pieces can be found everywhere. I have to gather as many of these as possible to finalize the incomplete succession.\u2019At present, Incomplete Dragon Body (5%) was displayed on Yeon-woo\u2019s status window.His brother\u2019s achievements(\u696d) had not been completely passed onto him yet. Yeon-woo intended to refine his vessel as much as possible in order to replace the word \u2018incomplete\u2019 with \u2018complete\u2019.\u2018To make my vessel as complete as possible. Let\u2019s focus on that for now.\u2019After organizing his thoughts, Yeon-woo then quietly took out a white mask from his bag and put it on his face.He would have to face a lot of people, so he covered his face in advance. Yeon-woo then slowly walked forward along the passage.* \u00a0*\u00a0 *Who knew for how long had he been walking.In that moment,\u201cOhyohyohyo. A guest at a time like this. I almost missed you and let you go.\u201dSuddenly, as a blue glow flashed in the air, a portal opened up, and someone dropped down from it.In an instant, Yeon-woo instinctively stepped back and took a combat stance with two daggers held crossed in front of him.It was because the appearance of the sudden intruder was too strange.A small stature that looked like only reached his waistline. Its skin was full of bumps and looked scabrous, its eyes were long and slanted. In particular, the glistening fangs that came out over its thick lips, piercing all the way through his mouth, stood out.The mere sight of it filled him with disgust.A monster.It was a creature called goblin.However, it gave Yeon-woo a very different impression from the normal goblins he saw in the diary.Unlike the normal goblin which usually has low intelligence and is only faithful to its instinct, the goblin in front of his eyes was wearing a strange monocle on one eye and a smart looking tuxedo.His well mannered behavior gave off a dignified atmosphere.\u201cNo matter how broad-minded I am, if you act like that, it does hurt my feelings. So why don\u2019t you put down your daggers?\u201dContrary to his words, the goblin was smiling delightedly and winking one eye.Only then did Yeon-woo seem to realize what the goblin before his eyes was.\u2018The guardian\u2019Those who manage and oversee each floor and trial in The Tower.\u201cGreetings. I am the guardian of the floor 0, Yvlke. Meeting like this is also destiny, why don\u2019t you give ourselves a round of applause? Ohyohyohyo.\u201dYeon-woo lowered the two daggers.The guardians belong to The Tower and lead the players throughout the trials. There was no reason to keep his guard up against him.\u201cHo, you believe me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s good to keep the guardian\u2019s advice in mind even if it sounds like a trivial thing.\u201d\u201cOh my. I guess you know about us a little. Since you were wearing a mask, I thought you were just shy. Anyway, it should be much easier to talk now.\u201dYvlke began explaining with some light jokes.\u201cThe tutorial is divided into seven sections, from A to F. Each section has a different environment, and a different challenge. You will be given scores depending on how you perform these challenges over a given period of time. At the end of the tutorial, all the scores will be added up and the results will be announced.\u201dYeon-woo was already roughly aware of the rules thanks to the diary.However, in order to avoid attracting too much attention from the guardian, and to confirm the rules he knew, he asked some questions.\u201cDo I have to pass all 7 sections?\u201d\u201cNot exactly. The tutorial is a place where you simply need to prove you possess the minimum qualifications. If you think your score is already high enough, you can simply stop there, but it\u2019ll be good to pass every trial to get a higher score.\u201d\u201cWhat are the benefits of getting a higher score?\u201d\u201cPlayers are given better rewards in proportion to their score. Shouldn\u2019t there be some motivation for players to get better results? The Tower and us guardians are very thorough in regard to that. Ohyohyohyo.\u201d\u201cHow long does the tutorial last?\u201d\u201cPlayers are given 30 days, one month. How you divide the time you spend in each section depends solely on the player. However,\u201dYvlke smiled as he adjusted his monocle.\u201cIt\u2019s been around a week since this round started. There\u2019s only about three weeks left of it. What do you want to do? Will you join in from the next round?\u201dIt\u2019s only been a week may sound like something simple. However, a week in the tutorial was by no means a short time.A period of time equal to one-fourth of the whole tutorial.\u2018During that first week, the front runners must have already run far ahead. To a point where latecomers could never catch up.\u2019The higher the score, the better the reward. It also increases the probability of passing the tutorial.For Yeonwoo, who was planning to achieve a lot within the tutorial, this was a very unfavorable start.However,\u2018That\u2019s what I expected anyway.\u2019A slight smile rose from Yeon-woo\u2019s lips.Not caring about his reaction, Yvlke went on explaining.\u201cAlthough this place is called the tutorial, it\u2019s still quite difficult. Normally, when passing through a section, we advise players to organize a party with at least three to five people. That way, players can proceed smoothly.\u201d\u201cThat means I get a higher score if I pass a section alone, right?\u201d\u201cYes, but it will be much harder.\u201d\u201cIf a late solo player catches up with the leading parties, do they get any benefit from that?\u201dYvlke\u2019s eyes shone behind his monocle.He realized what Yeon-woo was thinking.He gave off a broad smile, which made his fangs stand out even more.\u201cThe Tower grows based on players\u2019 achievements(\u696d). The score calculation will be adjusted accordingly to the player\u2019s individual achievements, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dAfter he finished confirming, Yeon-woo started to lightly warm up.*Crackle*\u2018No matter what, I must kill \u2018that guy\u2019. If I miss him, it will mess up the whole plan.\u201dYeonwoo recalled the biggest of the hidden pieces that could only be obtained within the tutorial.The guy who only appears during certain period of time.Only by killing him, would the succession process become much easier.*Crunch* *Crackle*His muscles began to tighten, his blood began to circulate faster, and his mind became lucid.Yvlke took a step back.He had already noticed that Yeon-woo wouldn\u2019t listen any more to his advice.There had been players like him before, and in the end they were one of two kinds.The ones that were too confident in their abilities, rushed forward and got fucked, or the ones that were truly a sight to behold.Whatever it was, Yvlke thought it would be fun to watch, so he did not stop Yeon-woo.\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d*Snap*Yvlke lightly flicked his fingers, creating a huge panel in the air.[Beginning the trial of floor 0.][Trial: You, a participant who aims to become a god, must prove yourself worthy of climbing The Tower. During the given time, pass through 7 gates and 7 challenges.][Requirements: achieve a high score within the time limit.]\u201cLet the trial begin.\u201dYvlke said goodbye with a dignified look as he disappeared like the wind.Then, a timer appeared in his place.[549:37:88_96][549:37:88_95]\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u2018There\u2019s about 22 days and 21 hours remaining?\u2019Yeon-woo clenched his dagger and stepped forward.\u2018Let\u2019s do this.\u2019A new message popped up as he crossed the line that seemed to divide the starting zone from Section A.[You have entered Section A][Either break through or deactivate all the traps in this section]A straight passage.He felt like the darkness was beckoning him to go that way.Yeonwoo carefully took a step forward, keeping his nerves on edge.But although he kept his guard up, nothing happened even after a considerable amount of time.As if nothing ever existed.An ordinary person would have relaxed a bit by now, but the further in Yeon-woo went, the more alert he became.Yvlke said it would be easy to pass through as long as players formed a party of 3~5 people.If that was correct, he shouldn\u2019t underestimate this place.Above all, danger comes without any notice. And when it comes, it always wipes out everything like a raging storm.Like right now.*Thwish*Out of nowhere, an arrow shot across the darkness.Yeon-woo instinctively turned his body aside.The arrow brushed past his left forearm. He could feel a scorching pain. Blood splashed as his clothes were torn.*Twing*\u2018A steel arrow!\u2019He came back to his senses. Yeon-woo frowned while looking at the arrow that was deeply embedded into the wall.The arrow was not made out of wood, but steel.His arm would have been torn off if he had allowed that arrow to hit him. If it had hit his head or abdomen it would have been deadly.The diary had warned him about the various traps in Section A.However, the location of each trap was different each time and they were randomly activated, so his brother\u2019s experience wasn\u2019t of much help.All he could do was staying alert and dodge his way through.*Swish* *Swish* *Swish*Steel arrows flew towards him in succession, all from different directions.It was impossible to track them with the naked eye.Yeon-woo crouched low and rolled forward. At the same time, he grabbed onto the backpack he was carrying on his back.Because it was thick, filled with clothes and various tools inside, it was useful as a cover.He had brought it for this purpose in the first place.*Puck* *Puck* *Puck*Three steel arrows stuck into his backpack.The impact was so strong that he felt as if his arm was coming off each time an arrow hit his backpack. Two of them even pierced through the backpack and poked out as if shyly showing their faces.He somehow managed to straighten himself up and stuck closely to a wall.In a situation where he didn\u2019t know where he was being sniped from, he had to reduce his physical exposure as much as possible. It was a rule he had learned the hard way.However,*Shlickt*Some traps seemed to have been installed not only at the front, but also at the back and at the very bottom.Before he knew it, there was an arrow stuck deep into his left thigh.\u201cHup!\u201dAt that moment, Yeon-woo felt like he saw a spark right in front of his eyes.In spite of the terrible pain, he gritted his teeth and tried turning his body around, but*Puck* *Puck* *Puck*Once again, arrows came flying in, they ripped through his backpack and penetrated his left shoulder, forearm and ribs.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tutorial (2)[A fierce pain overcomes you. You have been afflicted with \u2018Stun\u2019.][Your trait \u2018Cold-blooded\u2019 has helped you maintain composure.][The status effect \u2018Stun\u2019 has been removed. You have developed resistance to pain.]He felt as if his arm was being torn apart and he couldn\u2019t breath.Yeon-woo was familiar with this sensation.He gritted his teeth and held tightly onto his consciousness.He had suffered this kind of pain many times in Africa. Back then, he had been shot and his life was in danger. This pain was nothing compared to that.He then quickly checked on his condition.\u2018The parts where the arrows are stuck are my left shoulder, forearm and thigh. My ribs\u2026 were only grazed. The wounds look bad, but I can still move.\u2019As soon as his decision was made he carried out his actions immediately. Raising his, now completely ragged, backpack up, he stepped back as fast as he could.\u2018Apparently, traps were activated at the same time when I passed through a certain point.\u2019That meant there was a particular area where the traps were concentrated.He had to flee until he reached that place.Even as he retreated, the steel arrows kept flying towards him.At first, it was only one or two arrows, but past a certain point, four or five started to fly out at the same time.Still, he moved while refraining from exposing himself as much as possible.A long blood trail spread from his wound, staining the wall. In the meantime, two more steel arrows were inserted into his calf.When he reached a certain point, steel arrows no longer poured down on him.Yeon-woo leaned his back against the wall as he threw the backpack filled with steel arrows on the floor.His vision was spinning round and round.An unpleasant, stuffy smell lingered in his mouth.[Your wounds are bleeding severely. You have been afflicted with \u2018Stun\u2019.][Your trait \u2018Cold-blooded\u2019 has helped you maintain composure.][The status effect \u2018Stun\u2019 has been removed. You have developed resistance to bleeding.]Yeon-woo barely managed to hold onto consciousness.It was almost by instinct that his body had brought him to this point. If he lost consciousness here, he would die instantly.Yeon-woo plunged his hand into the torn backpack.The stuff that once filled the backpack had spilled out and rolled around randomly, and the steel arrows took their place instead.Fortunately, the medical kit hadn\u2019t been lost during the action, and it was quickly caught by his hand.Yeonwoo opened the kit and took out disinfectant, bandages, pre-connected needle and thread, \u00a0oil-fed cotton and a lighter.Because he could hardly use his left arm, it took him long time to pick up all the items.Once all his preparations were finished, without any delay, Yeon-woo moved his hand towards the steel arrow stuck in his left shoulder.And he pulled it out.\u201cKeuk!\u201dAs expected, a fierce pain followed. He felt as if his arm was falling off.The hand that was holding the steel arrow was trembling. Blood gushed out from the wound.With blood-stained eyes, Yeon-woo lit the cotton on fire and pressed it against the wound.*Tsss*The smell of burnt flesh filled the air.[Your skin has been set on fire. You have been afflicted with \u2018Stun\u2019.][Your trait \u2018Cold-blooded\u2019 has helped you maintain composure.][The status effect \u2018Stun\u2019 has been removed. You have developed resistance to burning.]The wound healed quickly leaving behind only a scar.In the same way, Yeon-woo pulled out the steel arrow stuck in his leg and stopped the bleeding. Then he applied disinfectant on it.Thankfully, none of his bones were broken. It was the result of moving his body instinctively.He could barely catch his breath after treating all of his wounds.\u201cHa\u2026Ha\u2026Ha\u2026!\u201dAll the strength drained out of his body. His left arm and leg felt weak.\u201cSuch a rough start from the very beginning. This is nuts.\u201dYeon-woo was so dumbfounded that he wanted to curse himself.He knew it would be dangerous, but he didn\u2019t think it would be this bad.There was such a big difference between knowing it in your head and experiencing it for real.\u2018I\u2019m glad I have this trait\u201dAn ability to maintain rationality in any situation, \u2018Cold-blooded\u2019.Yeon-woo felt grateful for the effect of his trait.He was already mentally strong before, but now, he felt much stronger thanks to being able to make quick judgement in a terrible situation like this.In addition, the extra \u201cresistance\u201d had also helped him relieve his pain little by little.He didn\u2019t know whether his trait was being enhanced, or his body was slowly adapting.He didn\u2019t know how the system worked.The only thing that was clear to him was that it was helpful to Yeon-woo.Then, he quickly put his thoughts in order.Yeon-woo cast his eyes toward the passage still buried in darkness.It felt as ferocious as the jaws of a beast, but every beast had its own weakness.\u2018There\u2019s a specific timing for each arrow being shot. There was also a signal, although very subtle.\u2019Yeon-woo narrowed his eyes.\u2018I have to figure out the timing.\u2019Traps loaded with steel arrows were a combination of multiple devices.Sensors captured someone approaching, cogwheels spinned to measure direction, and finally steel arrows were spewed out of the muzzle.\u2018Because of the darkness, it is impossible to spot the steel arrows with the naked eye. But before that, the cogwheels activate. I have to pick up the sound of the cogwheels spinning. That\u2019s the only chance I have to find the location and direction of the steel arrows.\u2019However, it takes only two to three seconds for the cogwheels to spin and the steel arrows to be fired. The sound is really quiet too.In that brief moment, he had to pinpoint the origin of the small sound.It might be easy to say, but it was impossible to execute without very fine senses and reflexes.But luckily, Yeon-woo had a new weapon with him.\u2018Skills\u2026 I have Sense Strengthening.\u2019With this skill that allows him to handle his five senses freely, there should be a way.The reason why all players are given basic skills that fit them, is because they should be able to use them to break through their challenges.The key is how well they could use their skills.Yeon-woo quietly closed his eyes and focused on the sounds around him.It wasn\u2019t too hard to concentrate.He was used to this kind of thing anyway.[\u2018Sense Strengthening\u2019 has been activated. Your auditory sense has been enhanced.][\u2018Sense Strengthening\u2019 skill proficiency has risen. 0.8%]Yeon-woo tried to concentrate on everything he could hear amidst the silence.But it was extremely difficult. It wasn\u2019t easy to differentiate the sounds he need from between dozens of small noises.*Plop**Plop*He heard some droplets of water dripping somewhere from the ceiling.*Rattle* *Clink*He also heard the slight sound of steel arrows being reloaded into the traps.Other than those, he also caught a lot of other noises throughout the passage.Still, he tried to pick out the sounds he wanted, one by one.Long time passed since.*Creak*\u2018This is it!\u2019Something let out a squeaky sound due to its rust. It was definitely a cogwheel.Yeon-woo opened his eyes and threw one of his dagger to one side.*Puck**Crunch*The dagger struck deep into one side of the ceiling, and soon a broken mechanical device and steel arrows fell down.\u2018Yes! I can find them.\u2019Yeon-woo\u2019s eyes sparkled.Of course, there were downsides of getting rid of his other senses and only focusing on hearing, but the important thing was that he found a way to go through the passage.Yeon-woo forced his creaking body up. His body still screamed in pain.He could barely move his left arm, and he was limping as he walked. It was crazy to move such state.Even if his footsteps were slow, Yeon-woo managed to get to the place where the next trap was installed.*Swish*Steel arrows were shot once again.\u2018Right shoulder!\u2019Yeon-woo had already heard the sound of a cogwheel, and turned his body sideways, measuring the direction from where the steel arrow flew in.*Puck*The steel arrow that narrowly missed his shoulder, was stuck deep into the wall.\u2018Yes!\u2019Yeon-woo clenched his fists.[\u2018Sense Strengthening\u2019 skill proficiency has increased. 1.5%]After feeling certain that it would work, Yeon-woo did not delay any longer and moved on to the next spot.*Swish* *Swish* *Swish* *Swish*\u2018Four.\u2019In order from top to bottom, each one aimed for his temple, heart, abdomen and knee.Yeon-woo dodged by turning his head sideway and taking a step forward at the same time.The arrow that was aiming for his thigh flew right past his leg and struck the floor. At the same time he used the flat of his dagger to block the arrow that was coming towards his abdomen.*Clang*The dagger trembled, producing a pleasant sound.His hand was hurting from the impact, but the thrill of it filled him with adrenaline.[\u2018Sense Strengthening\u2019 skill proficiency has increased. 2.1%][Your Strength has increased by 1 point][Your Dexterty has increased by 1 point]The messages notifying him of the increase of his skill level and attribute points filled his retina.\u2018If my Strength and Dexterty increased\u2026 Status window.\u2019[Player: Yeon-woo Cha]Trait: Cold-bloodedStrength: 11 \u00a0\u00a0Dexterity: 16 \u00a0 Health: 12 \u00a0\u00a0Magic Power: 21Skills: Draconic Eyes(0.0%), Sense Strengthening(2.1%), Foresight(0.0%)\u2018As I thought.\u2019Yeon-woo had a satisfied smile.In the real world, it takes a considerable amount of time and training to boost one\u2019s ability, but \u00a0here it\u2019s different.\u2018I can gain achievements as long as I exert myself . There can\u2019t be any other place like this.\u2019It was all thanks to this interface system that had enabled his brother\u2019s fast growth. Yeon-woo closed the status window and calmly judged the situation.\u2018Now, it\u2019s somewhat possible to dodge the arrows. But my reflexes are still slow.\u2019His dagger was half a beat too slow after spotting the arrows. Even if he noticed the arrows, it was meaningless if he was too slow to react.Yeon-woo divided his consciousness that was previously solely focused on hearing into his right hand.[\u2018Sense Strengthening\u2019 has been activated.

Next, he refined his blocking technique a little more. He deflected arrows with the flat side of his dagger, or lowered his head to avoid them. He also twisted his body sideway, or walked forward to clash with it.*Puck*There was a case in where he missed an arrow and was struck on his back.But Yeon-woo indifferently pulled out the arrow without giving out a single moan.After stopping the blood, he went straight ahead with limp steps.Yeon-woo silently kept on walking just like a machine.[\u2018Sense Strengthening\u2019 skill proficiency has increased. 3.1%][Your Strength has increased by 1 point][Your Health has increased by 1 point]\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, it wasn\u2019t always accurate.Moreover,\u2018Arrowheads with different colors were sparsely mixed within the other arrows.\u2019As his stats were steadily rising, he became more and more sensitive. And before he knew it, he could actually \u2018see\u2019 the arrows.At first, he thought he was wrong.It was very small, but various colors were painted on the tip of the arrowheads.But the light was too dim to tell the colors apart, and it was hard to check all the arrows at once when they all flew from different directions.And the fact that most of the arrows had only normal arrowheads also made him think against it.However, as his vision strengthened and his ability to see dynamic objects increased, his suspicion gradually turned into certainty.The colored arrowheads were there for certain.\u2018The colors I\u2019ve seen until now\u2026 was it red, blue and yellow?\u2019Yeon-woo was lost in thoughts.\u2018What on earth is it? Why do they have different colors?\u2019Then he remembered what he had seen in the diary.Now that I think of it, nothing in the tutorial was made for no reason, even the smallest little thing.Everything had a certain meaning to it.And the most curious thing was that. The colors painted on the arrowheads.\u2018Jeong-woo hadn\u2019t found out the secret behind this either. Is this some kind of hidden piece?\u2019His brother had barely passed Section A with his teammates, but Yeon-woo had been going at it by himself. This difference seemed to have helped him find the hidden piece that no one had found before.Yeon-woo resumed moving, thinking he should try it out.*Swish*Just in time, out of six arrows that were fired at him, there was one with a blue arrowhead.\u2018What I can check right now are my Attributes and Skills. If so.\u2019Yeon-woo avoided all the other arrows and only struck the blue one.*Tang*[Your Strength has increased by 1 point][\u2018Sense Strengthening\u2019 skill proficiency has increased. 4.2%]The messages informing him about the growth of his Strength stat and skill proficiency appeared.It wasn\u2019t ineffective, but.\u2018This isn\u2019t it.\u2019Yeon-woo shook his head.\u2018There must be something else. A distinct difference that separates them from the other arrows.\u2019After a long time, another colored arrow flew in. This time it was red.Yeon-woo turned around and dodged all the arrows except for the red one, which he then parried.He could feel a twinge in his wrist from parrying the arrow, realizing it was heavier than the rest.[You have blocked a red arrow][Your Strength has increased by 3 points]\u2018This is it!\u2019Yeon-woo felt himself sobering.A drastic increase in Strength.It was a big difference from the usual slow growth.\u2018Status window.\u2019[Player: Yeon-woo Cha]Trait: Cold-bloodedStrength: 19 \u00a0\u00a0Dexterity: 19\u00a0\u00a0 Health: 14 \u00a0\u00a0Magic Power: 21Skills: Draconic Eyes(0.0%), Sense Strengthening(4.3%), Foresight(0.0%)Yeon-woo faintly smiled.As time went by, the growth speed of his attributes had been slowing down little by little.Now, he found a way to increase his attributes once again.\u2018Each color must be related to a different attribute. Red was Strength. Then, what about the other ones?\u2019When he blocked the blue arrow, nothing happened. This meant that different actions are required depending on the color.As soon as Yeon-woo came to a rough understanding, he proceeded much faster.*Swish*The blue arrow was faster than others.This time, he didn\u2019t strike it but narrowly avoided it.[You have dodged a blue arrow][Your Dexterity has increased by 2 points]The yellow arrow was sharper.Because striking and dodging actions were already assigned to different colors, he put out his left arm just to see if it worked.*Puck*[You have been hit by a yellow arrow][Your Health has increased by 2 points]\u201cThis is crazy.\u201dYeon-woo barely managed to pull out a portion of the arrow before his expression turned into a frown due to the pain. Feeling as if his arm was falling off.He inhibited the nerves in charge of transmiting pain as much as possible, and had only exposed the parts where the bones and joints wouldn\u2019t get damaged, but it was clearly a something a normal person wouldn\u2019t do.He started feeling dizzy again because of the loss of blood.He was barely holding himself together thanks to his increased Health. But without it he would have already fallen.And then,*Cough*Yeon-woo coughed a mouthful of blood. The blood dripped down from the palm that was covering his mouth.Inhibiting his nerves didn\u2019t make the symptoms go away.The pain was spreading along the nerves in his left arm throughout his whole body.He kept retching.He was on the verge of fainting.His body was warning him that he couldn\u2019t endure it anymore. That it was already crazy that he had endured so far, and that if he didn\u2019t have some rest right away, he would actually collapse.Yeon-woo, however, gritted his teeth again.\u2018This pain is nothing compared to what Jeong-woo went through.\u2019Even though Yeon-woo had not experienced it himself, he was well aware of the pain his brother had suffered, because he had watched the recorded images in the diary over and over.If he couldn\u2019t stand even this, there was nothing he could do for his brother in the future.Yeon-woo forcefully pulled out the yellow arrow from his left arm.His body had already reached its limit, but in the process, he had achieved what he desired.Red is Strength, blue is Dexterity, yellow is Health.Then, all he needed to do was to act according to each color.There was still a long way to go before reaching the end of the passage.Through his senses, he could feel that there were still lots of traps. Which also meant that there were lots of attribute points he could still raise.Once again, blood gathered in the bottom of his jaw.Yeon-woo swallowed it back and moved along. His eyes blazing like flames.One step at a time.Yeon-woo rushed with tottering steps.* \u00a0*\u00a0 *\u201cOhyohyohyo. He is truly an amazing participant. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen such a character.\u201dThousands of screens were floating in several rows in front of the guardian Yvlke, Showing all players currently participating in the tutorial. They all had different looks.However, Yvlke\u2019s eyes were fixed only on one screen located in a corner.In there was Yeon-woo, who was trudging down a passage as if he was about to fall any moment soon.\u2018Originally, he shouldn\u2019t be such an eye-catching individual.\u2019In fact, this tutorial round had a lot to see.Not only the siblings from the Cheong-lam family, the most anticipated ones among the One-horned tribes, but also the dumbass duo who are aiming to become rankers, and a swordsman of Marcusian descent.\u201dEach one of them was strong enough that even if they started climbing The Tower straight away, they wouldn\u2019t fall behind.They had already entered Section E early on and had been carrying out missions. Some of them were already in Section F.It was unknown who would be the one to achieve the highest score in this tutorial.However, Yvlke\u2019s eyes were strangely fixed on Yeonwoo, who had been stranded in Section A for days, rather than those in Section E.He thought Yeon-woo was going to die after a few steps when he first showed up.And that this little fucker without any ability would get above himself and get fucked.But Yeon-woo completely exceeded his expectations.Others would struggle to pass through or even be annihilated in Section A, even if they formed parties, but Yeon-woo gradually made progress by himself and even found the hidden piece hidden in the arrowheads.And with an iron will, he was steadily raising his stats by taking advantage of the hidden piece.Even though Yeon-woo\u2019s body was clearly in a state where it wouldn\u2019t be strange for him to fall down at any minute.\u2018This guy, he\u2019s the real deal.\u2019After being a guardian for such a long time, he could feel it intuitively.Other frontrunners were also great, but this was the guy who was going to turn the whole tutorial on its head.\u201cThere will still be a lot of dangers waiting ahead even if he manages to break through this section, but if he can pass the other sections as wisely as he is right now\u2026.\u201dYvlke adjusted his monocle.Yeon-woo was already reaching the last part of Section A.\u201cI think this round of the tutorial will be a lot of fun. Ohyohyohyo.\u201d* \u00a0*\u00a0 *[Player: Yeon-woo Cha]Trait: Cold-bloodedStrength: 29 \u00a0\u00a0Dexterity: 33\u00a0\u00a0 Health: 30 \u00a0\u00a0Magic Power: 21Skills: Draconic Eyes(0.0%), Sense Strengthening(8.3%), Foresight(0.0%)While he was walking down the passage, Yeon-woo check his status window and clenched his fists.\u2018All the attributes except for Magic Power have risen sharply.\u2019Compared to when he first arrived, he had earned a total sum of 55 attribute points..\u2018In order to raise their attribute points, one has to train regularly or push themselves over the limit. Even though I\u2019ve been tackling it as a solo player, the amount of achievements I\u2019ve made so far in one day should count as decent.\u2019No, actually it was not just decent.It was a great accomplishment.None of the other players were able to improve their attribute points by this much in such a short term.\u2018It\u2019s not just this. My muscle strength, mobility, endurance, explosive power, and power in general has increased.\u2019It might have been physically difficult, but the result made him satisfied.he was a little disappointed that he couldn\u2019t raise his Magic Power, but he erased the idea from his head because he didn\u2019t feel the need for it right now.*Grin*Yeon-woo pushed the iron gate in front of him with a slight smile on his mouth.*Creak*[You have arrived at the arrival point.][Your wounds will be healed.]It was the moment when he reached the iron gate that what seemed like an endless passage ended.Yeon-woo was already as exhausted as he could be.His body was riddled with traces of blood, and there were a couple of arrows that hadn\u2019t been pulled out yet.His head was burning from continuously focusing too much on his senses.He didn\u2019t know what other traps were waiting beyond the iron gate. Still, Yeon-woo opened it and stepped past.Then, what appeared in front of him was a room of around 10 pyeong[1] of space.At the same time,*Whoosh*A swarm of white lights rose along the wounds where bloody pus was forming.The wounds started to slowly heal and the pus subsided. His worn out body was also being filled up with energy.The base was designed to allow players who were hurt and tired from passing through Section A to recuperate.Yeon-woo felt both relieved that he could catch his breath, and satisfied that he had grown to this point.*Sreuk*And he fell asleep without realizing it.* \u00a0*\u00a0 *\u2018Did I fall asleep?\u2019Yeon-woo\u2019s body felt stiff.As he saw in the diary, it was possible to recover one\u2019s physical condition at the arrival point.When he noticed his wounds were being treated, he felt a sense of relief and only wanted to take a nap for a while.But he slept more than intended.And when he opened his eyes to check the time.\u201cPeekaboo?\u201dSuddenly, a man whose face was covered under a robe waved his hand towards Yeon-woo.Yeon-woo was so surprised that he quickly stood up and jumped backwards. He quickly brought his hand to his waist.Cold sweat ran down his back.\u2018This man, what is he?\u2019How come he never noticed a person being right next to him?His Sense Strengthening skill was clearly active.The skill was scanning the entire room, but this guy was the only one to avoid it.As if he was isolated from the world.In that moment, a description from the diary rushed upon his mind.Occasionally, merchants would pop up at the arrival point, and they sold items that players needed for a price. Ranging from ordinary food to potions, skill books, and all kinds of different artifacts, the merchants sold everything there was.\u201cThe mysterious merchant?\u201d\u201cHoho!\u201dThe man in the robe let out a chuckle and clapped his two hands.*Clap*Then, the space behind the man distorted, revealing shelves stocked with miscellaneous items.\u201cI\u2019m glad you know who I am.

Tutorial (4)Yeon-woo didn\u2019t know what to make of this mysterious merchant. He had just said \u2018peekaboo\u2019, and \u2018gullible\u2019.He couldn\u2019t read the merchant\u2019s expression because of the robes obscuring his face , but he seemed to be enjoying this situation.Yeon-woo slightly knitted his eyebrows.\u2018I\u2019ve been too complacent.\u2019The mysterious merchant, like the guardian, was absolutely forbidden from intervening with the players.That\u2019s why the merchant didn\u2019t hurt him while he was asleep.\u2018But even though I was exhausted, I shouldn\u2019t have slept like that.\u201d[503:20:19_53]He checked the time and saw that 12 hours had passed since he arrived at this base.It had taken him about a day and 10 hours to get through this first half of Section A. In total, approximately 46 hours had passed since arriving at the tutorial.It was pretty fast for a solo player.There was no doubt as to why his body was so exhausted. After all, he had forced himself to power through the section with his body on the verge of collapsing.However, Yeon-woo didn\u2019t like this situation.He knew, of course, that after any kind of intensive training, sufficient rest was necessary to allow for growth. Because the human body was not a machine.No, even machines needed plenty of rest to prevent overheating.But Yeon-woo couldn\u2019t afford that right now.For him, The Tower was no better than a battlefield, and on a battlefield there was no room for rest at all.He had to be wary about enemies that could come out from anywhere at anytime.And the same could be applied to the arrival point.Even if he was no longer under the threat of the steel arrows, it was still a place where other players were free to enter.Even if the mysterious merchant couldn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t be strange for other players to try and harm him while he was sleeping.\u2018Even if I was too exhausted\u2026.\u2019Yeon-woo put his thoughts together.He had to admit that after being away from the battlefield for some time, he had become dull.So he decided to sharpen himself.To revert to what he used to be.\u2018Cain\u2019.Yeon-woo opened his eyes as he thought back to the code name that was used to refer to him, but was now left unused.His eyes were shimmering with cold determination.In that instant, the mysterious merchant had a strange expression on his face.Although it didn\u2019t show because it was hidden by his robes, he seemed to have noticed a big change in Yeon-woo\u2019s mindset preceded by his psychological struggles.And he asked with a light smile.\u201cDid you find yourself in need of anything on your way here, sir? I\u2019m the merchant who sells everything that exists in this world. If you need anything, just name it. Need any artifacts, or slaves? I\u2019ve got some information too. I\u2019ll sell them at a proper price.\u201dThe mysterious merchant flicked his finger lightly.Then, a window popped up in front of Yeon-woo.The items he had for trade were listed and divided into multiple categories.Yeon-woo lightly clicked his tongue as he touched the window.\u2018Medusa\u2019s Venom, Horn of the Golden Mountain Goat, Left eye of Tiamat\u2026 and Nightmare of Walpurgis too? He deals with these kind of items in the tutorial? This is insane.\u201dThe items that occupied the top of the list were items that rankers would fervently jump at, if carried to upper floors of The Tower.The list was also full of things that could easily help you put an end to the tutorial.However, this was nothing but a wild-goose chase. There was no way players that were going through the tutorial could afford items like these.Thankfully, items of lower rating were also found as he scrolled down.He could find good items for beginners here and there.\u2018Arhan-style Swordsmanship Manual, Introduction to One-Circle Magic, and Success Formula to Elemental Sorcery. These are the skill books that might come in handy. But it will also require some effort to attain proficiency in their respective skills.\u2019In particular, a dagger named \u2018Venomous Fang of Barma\u2019 grabbed Yeon-woo\u2019s attention.[Venomous Fang of Barma]Attack power: 25A dagger made by smelting the teeth of a serpent that inhabits the swamps of Barma. Poison is applied on the edge of the dagger, causing a certain chance of poisoning the opponent when hit. The poison\u2019s effect is random.\u2018To be exact, it\u2019s a dagger that deals with curses, not poison.\u2019The weapon cursed its target as soon as it came into contact.There was a wide variety of curses that could be given to the target. Poisoning, burn, freeze, electrocution, hallucination, stun, blind, and so on. One of the curses would be randomly applied on the target.If the opponents couldn\u2019t find a proper way to fight against this erratic curse, it was possible to easily take them down amidst their confusion.Moreover, it was made from the teeth of a mystical creature, so even after reaching the higher floors, he could continue using it as a magic item.If he bought it, he would be able to put it to good use.However, Yeon-woo took his eyes off of the dagger and moved on to the next categories.\u2018It would be good to have it, but right now I need to focus on physical training. There\u2019s no need to rely on artifacts yet.\u201dA long time passed while he was looking through the list.Then, at one point Yeon-woo stopped scrolling.\u2018Found it.\u2019[Reset ticket]You can return to any place you desire.Yeon-woo looked at the mysterious merchant with a grin.\u201cWhat\u2019s the price for the items?\u201d\u201cWe are conscientious merchants who offer only reasonable prices. We never overcharge players for items they need. We can\u2019t rip off those who don\u2019t have money\u2026.\u201d\u201cMake it brief.\u201d\u201cThe attribute points you have. That\u2019s all you have to pay.\u201dConscientious merchants?Yeon-woo placed his hand on the \u201cMineral water\u201d at the bottom of the list.[Mineral water]A bottle of drinking water required when thirsty. Be sure to have some with you.Price: Strength 2Mere water costs 2 Strength points, and what? Conscientious?Yeon-woo was so dumbfounded that he burst out laughing.Of course, given its ludicrous price, he could just ignore it and not buy it.But the problem was that humans needed water to live, and there was no way to supply oneself with drinking water or even food during the tutorial.\u201c3 Dexterity points for one day worth of food.\u2019Even if someone brought enough food and water from the outside, it could be lost on the way, or even be stolen by other players.In addition, players who barely managed to get through Section A often found themselves in need of better equipment.\u2018There\u2019s a boss room beyond this point, so players have no choice but to fully equip themselves for the fight.\u201dSo the players would have to bite the bullet and buy items from the mysterious merchant.But then, with their lowered attribute points, the next fight would be even tougher, and they would have to trade the attribute points they had just barely manage to pile up again to buy the next set of equipment, throwing themselves into a vicious cycle.And here he is, calling himself a \u2018conscientious merchant\u2019.He was no better than a thief.Yeon-woo smirked a little.\u2018I don\u2019t know who designed the tutorial, but they are truly evil.\u2019After closing the category window, Yeon-woo said.\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to buy.\u201d\u201cYes. Say it.\u201d\u201cIn exchange for all the attribute points I got from Section A,\u201dYeon-woo had already decided what to purchase.\u201cI\u2019d like to buy tickets to reset Section A.\u201dThe rules didn\u2019t allow players to re-attempt a section after clearing it. But when he heard that there was a rare ticket that could send a player back to any chosen place, a thought came to his mind.If he could stack up attribute points by repeatedly going through Section A, wouldn\u2019t it be much easier to proceed afterwards?In that brief moment, the mysterious merchant\u2019s eyes gave off a strange glow under the robes.Eyes filled with interest.\u201cDo you mean the reset tickets?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI do have those, but I\u2019ve never seen anyone interested in that item. Usually, after surviving Section A, players would ask for things that can make the next section easier for them, and not something that will make them go through Section A all over again.\u201d\u201cWell, I personally have something in mind.\u201d\u201cIf you say so.\u201dThe mysterious merchant chuckled and then clapped his hands.*Clap*All the shelves at his back disappeared.And then.[Attribute points acquired through Section A will be paid in exchange for the purchase.][You have acquired \u2018Reset ticket for Section A\u2019 x10]Yeon-woo felt his body deflating like a balloon. The battle hardened body he had just a moment ago felt almost like a dream.Instead, his hand was now holding 10 pink colored tickets.\u201cThe method to use the ticket is very simple. Just tear off your ticket whenever you want , and you\u2019ll be teleported back to the starting zone.\u201dYeon-woo shoved the tickets into his pocket.\u201cI\u2019ll use it well.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d appreciate if you do. I must be off. I hope we meet again.\u201dThe mysterious merchant gently turned around and melted away leaving no trace.The room surrounding Yeon-woo also started to disappear like a wave, and he found himself in a different place.Unlike the empty passage way he came through, ahead were dozens of scarecrows standing in a row. There were also some people other than Yeon-woo in that place.Far in the distance, about five people were blasting away all kinds of skills against the scarecrows.He also heard people screaming in anger, signifying that the scarecrows weren\u2019t so easy to deal with.[This is Section A\u2019s boss room. Do you want to enter?]Yeon-woo took out a ticketHe wanted to experience the difficulty of the boss, but with his current body\u2019s condition, just one mistake and he would be toast.He tore the ticket without hesitation.*Whoosh*He opened his eyes and found himself in a familiar place.It was the starting zone where he had arrived before.He drew a dagger from his waist and held it in his right hand.\u2018I must raise my attributes as high as possible while I\u2019m here.\u2019This time, he intended to make Section A entirely of his own.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tutorial (5)[355:59:32_11]*Swish* *Swish*Steel arrows were flying at Yeon-woo. 15 in total, it was more than usual.It was the result of Yeon-woo deliberately activating more traps by running in zigzag.Each one of them came from different angles and in varying speeds.Before, it would have been impossible for Yeon-woo to dodge them by relying only on his senses.*Pat*Yeon-woo swung his dagger to strike an arrow that came from the front and spinned his body. At the same time, he stretched out his empty hand.One of the steel arrows which was passing right by his chest was caught in his hand and, as he was spinning, he quickly swung the arrow to deflect another one coming from the back.Then he raised his left foot and kicked another arrow that was coming towards his ankle.*Clang*It may have been a long explanation, but everything took place in a split second.It was something beyond human capabilities.Nevertheless, Yeon-woo showed no sign of exhaustion.Rather, he was driving himself into more dangerous situations out of sheer frustration.He had now risen to a point where he didn\u2019t have to consciously search for the the arrows. He intuitively captured the position of the projectiles with his developed senses, and unconsciously dodged them thanks to his reflexes.He also didn\u2019t feel pain anymore when blocking the steel arrows.*Tak*Yeon-woo stopped running as he reached the arrival point.He could hear some noises coming from the boss room up ahead. The same scene that had been going on for days.However, Yeon-woo didn\u2019t pay much attention to the boss room and checked the time.[351:48:11_78]\u201cHoo! This time it took me around 4 hours?\u201dIt was the time it took him to get through Section A.It was an astonishing improvement considering that it had taken him more than 34 hours on his first try.After spending ten reset tickets, Yeon-woo had been able to make tremendous advancement by going through Section A several times.Every time he reset Section A, the position, timing and potency of the traps changed.Therefore, during his first attempts, Yeon-woo had to be on high alert to identify the directions from where the steel arrows were coming.Moreover, under such circumstances he also put restrictions on himself to reduce the time spent traveling back and forth.He had been in near-death situations several times.There was a moment when he miscounted the number of steel arrows and one had almost hit his head, and another moment when an arrow skewered through his right hand, causing him to nearly lose his entire arm.He had to go through all sorts of things, however, every single time, Yeon-woo had somehow managed to escape death and achieve his goal.It\u2019s been six days ever since.[Player: Yeon-woo Cha]Trait: Cold-bloodedStrength: 51 \u00a0\u00a0Dexterity: 56\u00a0\u00a0 Health: 55 \u00a0\u00a0Magic Power: 21Skills: Draconic Eyes(2.1%), Sense Strengthening(15.1%), Foresight(0.0%)\u2018They\u2019ve gone up by a lot.\u201dYeon-woo had a gratified smile on his face as he looked at his attribute points. They had increased by an average of nearly 40 points in comparison to when he arrived.Although his Magic Power was still the same, his other attributes could not be compared to what they used to be.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that the growth speed of my attributes has decreased after the eighth attempt.\u201dHis training method that took advantage of the colored arrows had resulted in a steep increase of his attributes. The change in his body was so drastic that Yeon-woo almost couldn\u2019t get used to it.However, after certain point, his attribute points didn\u2019t improve much anymore.It seemed that there was a limit to the amount of points that could be gained from the hidden piece. And the fact that the arrows were no longer a threat to Yeon-woo also contributed to slowing down his improvement.\u2018But now I should be able to hold my own against most players. Though it\u2019ll still be hard to catch up with the frontrunners.\u2019He was already getting accustomed to his skills.Now he could control not only his auditory and haptic senses, but also his visual, olfactory and gustatory senses quite freely.He had also learned a unique way to improve his ability in a short period of time by amplifying all of his senses at the same time whenever he had the chance to.He was able to acquire \u2018Synesthesia(\u5171\u611f\u89ba)\u2019, which was something he had only heard about before.\u2018Same with the Draconic Eyes.\u2019Draconic Eyes, a skill that allowed the caster to borrow, to a certain extent, the Ancient Dragon Kalatus\u2019 Eyes of Truth.When Yeon-woo used the Draconic Eyes for the first time, he was shocked by what he saw.In the vision that Draconic Eyes granted him, everything lost its color.The world was composed of only black lines in a white background.Objects consisted of only a black line illustrating their outline. If there was a separate structure inside something, it was also shown on a smaller scale.It looked like a croquis on a white canvas.\u2018No. It\u2019s more like an X-Ray picture. Almost like clairvoyance.\u2019The eyes that erases outer appearance and projects both form and interior.It seemed to reflect the \u2018real\u2019 image that things originally had. The lines that formed the basis of things.His brother had referred to them as \u2018flaws(\u7f3a)\u2019.When I first came to have the Draconic Eyes, I was very surprised by the sight of this new world. And it was only later, that I realized how much it meant to see \u2018flaws\u2019.Yeon-woo had tried an experiment before. He experimented by cutting a small rock.He observed and stabbed a flat rock that was originally designed for players to rest on at the arrival point.Normally, the dagger shouldn\u2019t have been able to penetrate the rock, but contrary to expectations, the rock was easily cut apart. Like cutting a tofu with a knife.He knocked on the rock to see if it was soft to begin with, but it was as hard as the stone that formed the walls of Section A. The cross section was smooth as if it had been sanded down.Since then, Yeon-woo had steadily been using his Draconic Eyes to train himself to distinguish flaws that were easy to attack.It was a level of growth worth to be proud of.It was all thanks to the fact that he had pushed himself to the point of not even sleeping.Yeon-woo, however, was still not satisfied.\u2018If I had started along with the frontrunners I would have already reached Section E by now. If I stay behind any further, I will never catch up to them.\u2019It was natural that the gap would continue to widen as they advance to higher sections.Yeon-woo could not delay any longer.He turned his eyes towards the boss room.He presumed it was time for a full-out race.* \u00a0* \u00a0 *Before leaving, Yeon-woo took a brief moment to meditate and put his thoughts in order.It was a habit to do so before stepping into the battlefield.He had learned it from an Indian soldier when he was in Africa, and afterwards it had become a routine.The advantage of doing so was that he could get rid of distracting thoughts and be completely focused on combat.Just like right now.Yeon-woo organized in his head everything he had been practicing.Things mainly related to the changes in his body caused by the improvement of his stats, and adapting his skills and senses to his newfound body.Yeon-woo wanted to analyze the movement of his muscles and skeleton in response to each different action he took.Before, he had set his senses to only feel his surroundings.He did not know when or from where an arrow would fly in, so he had to pay close attention to the outside in order to survive.However, now that he had some leeway, he decided to focus part of his senses on his own body.He tried to observe as many physical changes as he could.The motion of his muscles when stimulated from the outside, the reaction of his nervous system, the sound produced by his skeleton, the changes in body in accordance to different movements, and the differences generated from using a skill.He tried memorizing one by one every minute detail of his body.In case he found himself in an extreme situation, in order to escape danger and survive, he had to make sure to control his every movement down to a cellular level.And of course, in order to do so, he first had to have complete control over his body.*Crack*And that\u2019s probably why.At one point, Yeon-woo was able to sense something very faint flowing through his body.It was easy to figure out what it was.\u2018Magic Power.\u2019It was mana.Although very feeble, mana was definitely present in his body. And as it cycled through it over time, it was slowly affecting his body.When a skill was activated, mana moved along with it.When he used sense strengthening, mana gathered around the specific part of the body he was focusing on. And when he used draconic eyes, mana seeped into his eyes.Yeon-woo tried to trace the mana back to the path it took in order to imitate its movement as closely as possible.But at some point, mana disappeared as if toying with him.He had fully focused his senses inside his body and followed after the mana, but it disappeared without leaving a trace.Yeon-woo felt a little heavy, but he decided not to push himself.He discovered the fact the that mana constitutes the basis of skills, and was somehow present in his body, but in a dormant state.If so, he only needed to take things step by step. Then one day, he might be able to handle mana freely.* \u00a0*\u00a0 *[348:25:10_01]Yeon-woo opened his eyes after finishing his meditation. He felt refreshed as if he had a good night\u2019s sleep. His body felt lighter than ever.And after finishing his preparations, he opened the iron gate carrying his backpack on one shoulder.[You have entered the boss room of Section A][There are 88 scarecrows along with several traps that will try to stop you from advancing. Cut through the scarecrows and beat the boss room]As soon as the message popped up,*Swish*A steel arrow flew in as if it had been waiting for this moment.*Clang*Yeonwoo instinctively turned the dagger sideways and struck the steel arrow.The steel arrow bounced upwards, and flew back in the direction it came from, and got itself stuck in the trap.Broken pieces of the trap fell down from the ceiling.It was a movement he had practiced in his ninth attempt through Section A.He liked this method because he could train both accuracy and technique at the same time.Yeon-woo observed the scarecrows that filled the passage.They looked like ordinary scarecrows, commonly seen in the countryside.But the scarecrows in the boss room were moving little by little.Their two feet and two arms were unrestrained so they could move around on their own, and they could hinder the players trying to pass by their side.\u2018They seem pretty solid, too.\u2019There had been a team trying to beat the boss room for a week.Every time Yeon-woo reached the end of Section A, he could see them being blocked by the scarecrows without making any progress.The scarecrow did not attack the players, but only blocked their way forward.But even that was enough to hold them back.Every time the players tried to break through the scarecrows, it didn\u2019t work. They didn\u2019t fall down when attacked, and they didn\u2019t move an inch when pushed.The only traces left on the scarecrows were mere scratches and soot. This meant that hitting them with neither physical strength nor skills would do any good.Plus, there were a lot of traps all over the place.The traps in the boss room were different from those in Section A.In addition to steel arrows, a variety of other traps were also added, including poison arrows, fire arrows, pitfalls, spear traps and so on.If players were too busy avoiding the scarecrows, they might get caught in the traps.But Yeon-woo was confident.\u2018I have to get to Section B immediately.\u2019Yeon-woo held the dagger in his right hand and sprang forward.*Swish* *Swish*Then five steel arrows poured down on him.However, Yeon-woo did not even lay his eyes on the arrows and lightly swung the dagger to the side.*Tang* *Tang*\u2018I have to go faster. Never slow down.\u2019Yeon-woo put more power into his legs.*Papat**Rumble*Then the ground sank down in front of Yeon-woo.But Yeon-woo was also familiar with this kind of trap.And he had already \u2018read\u2019 through it with his strengthened sense.*Ta-dak*Yeon-woo leaped high into the air right above the sunken ground.Right beneath him, there was a bottomless abyss opening its jaw.\u2018If I fall, I would be instantly dead. Then.\u2019Yeon-woo softly somersaulted over the gap, as if he were performing acrobatics.Drawing a long arc in the air, Yeon-woo tried to land beyond the hole, but two arrows came flying from both sides.It should have been hard to avoid them in midair, but Yeon-woo twisted his body like a spinning top and easily bounced off the arrows that came at him.*Clang* *Clang*The arrows that were aimed at him fell down helplessly into the hole.*Tak*Yeon-woo was able to land safely across the hole.And this time, he felt heat from the ceiling.As the fire descended along a hidden wick, it fluttered its red tongue to devour Yeon-woo.*Rush*But Yeon-woo has already gained some resistance against burning through his trait.He quickly covered his mouth with a handkerchief and ran through the fire.Even if some cinders got onto his clothes, he only shook them off and kept running without much concern.He slanted the dagger to its side and swung it, creating a gust of wind that pierced a path through the flames for a short time.He ran through the path wasting no time.*Swish* *Swish*Besides the steel arrows, various other arrows also poured out.Arrows lit on fire, arrows coated with poison, arrows with a hooked tip, etc.Whenever the arrows flew at hi, Yeon-woo either avoided them, parried them, or blocked them.Despite pouring in from all sides, the arrows could not even touch Yeon-woo\u2019s hair.It was as if he had eyes all over the place.Despite the obstacles, Yeon-woo did not slow down at all.On the contrary, his clearing speed was gradually increasing as his Health attribute rose.The other traps also made no difference.Pitfalls, fire traps, spear traps, rolling rocks, all of them failed to stop Yeon-woo.At that moment, the scarecrows started taking action.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tutorial (6)*Clatter*A bronze scarecrow suddenly came forward and moved at a rapid pace, blocking Yeon-woo\u2019s way. However, Yeon-woo twisted his body in order to avoid it.The scarecrow then proceeded to narrow the gap between them by dashing towards Yeon-woo.Yeon-woo tripped the scarecrow\u2019s leg as it ran towards him. His leg ached because of the scarecrow\u2019s hardness, but the pain was tolerable thanks to Yeon-woo\u2019s developed muscles.Then, another scarecrow came from the front.Yeon-woo bent his arm and smacked the scarecrow\u2019s chest with his elbow. Taking advantage of the knockback, he moved below its arm and dashed right past him. Several traps also activated in tandem, but none of them could stop Yeon-woo.[Your Dexterity has increased by 1 point.][Your Health has increased by 1 point.]\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7[\u2018Sense Strengthening\u2019 skill proficiency has increased. 15.6%]\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7[\u2018Sense Strengthening\u2019 skill proficiency has increased. 16.9%]\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7His attribute points increased as he broke through the traps.Yeon-woo\u2019s movements became more sophisticated as his attributes increased causing his skill proficiency to also increase alongside.Then, with his keener senses, he passed through more traps which led yet to another rise in attribute points.Increase in attribute points \u2013 increase in skill proficiency \u2013 increase in attribute points\u2026 Thanks to this loop, Yeon-woo was able to achieve remarkable growth in the blink of an eye.\u2018It\u2019s a lot faster than when I ran through Section A.\u2019Yeon-woo had confidence in himself.His feet were much lighter, and his hands were brimming with strength.When there were only about ten scarecrows left ahead of him, one of the scarecrows, which until now had only been blocking the way, revealed its sharp teeth for the first time.As if it were human, it firmly squared its shoulders and tackled Yeon-woo\u2019s side.*Bang*A painful feeling struck him, as if he had bumped into a wall as hard as he could. The same pain he felt when he got hit by a steel arrow for the first time.He fell several meters back as the suffocating pain caused him to frown.On the other hand, the scarecrow didn\u2019t budge an inch from where it had tackled Yeon-woo.Unlike the scarecrows he saw earlier, this one\u2019s surface flashed with a red tint as if it were made of copper.Its strong shoulders gave off an overpowering feeling.\u2018Is this the guy who imitates players?\u2019[Copper Scarecrow]A scarecrow that mimics the movements and actions of the player. It is also capable of attacking within a certain range.His brother had made a separate reference for this one.The real boss of Section A are not just scarecrows. The real deal are the 10 copper puppets at the very back. They copy the players\u2019 movements and grate on their nerves.Their body is also strong as hell, so we were obstructed by them for a long time.There are two ways to break through.One way is to fight head-on.The other way is\u2018To dominate them.\u2019Yeon-woo held tightly onto his dagger.The copper puppets tested players with what they had developed and acquired throughout Section A.When three players formed a team, three scarecrows would appear to block their way. If there were five players, likewise, there would be five scarecrows. The scarecrows copied the players\u2019 skills, forcing them to overcome themselves.If they did, they could pass through the boss room, but if they didn\u2019t, they would be tied here forever.And if they couldn\u2019t even do that, the only alternative was death.However, Yeon-woo had been repeatedly surpassing his limits by breaking through Section A several times.These copper puppets were annoying, but it didn\u2019t feel like they would poise a problem.What bothered him the most was that his plan to bust through the boss room in one go was hindered by a mere doll.He opened his Draconic Eyes wide, and found the flaws scattered throughout the copper puppet.And the minute he tried to stab the puppet,\u201cIt operates with a sensor. Find the sensor and destroy it!\u201dHe heard a voice coming from a corner.Yeon-woo had already been aware of his presence thanks to his senses, but he had just ignored him because he didn\u2019t want to get involved.The copper puppet raised its hand and aimed at Yeon-woo\u2019s head.Yeon-woo slightly bent over to the side, grabbed one of its joints and twisted it.*Crack*The puppet\u2019s forearm bent in a bizarre direction.Yeon-woo then charged into its chest, held the dagger in a reverse grip and stabbed three times into its flaws.In the end, he adjusted his grip and hit its abdomen as hard as he could.*Kwang*The copper puppet exploded into dozens of fragments and splattered in all directions like a firework.*Rustle*The pieces of the copper puppet crumpled, raising some dust.Yeon-woo brushed the dust off his shoulders.\u201cWha\u2026 What just happened\u2026?\u201dA dazed voice was heard from behind.* \u00a0*\u00a0 *Yeon-woo threw a glance to the back.In one corner, where the lights hardly reached, there was a young man hiding, obscured by the shadows.The young man got startled when their eyes met. But then, he put more strength into his eyes and stared at Yeon-woo as if refusing to lose.Yeon-woo bluntly walked over to him.The young man clenched his teeth. He glanced to the side to check his surroundings. When he noticed that Yeon-woo was walking towards him, he stared even more intently.But contrary to his gutsy look, his legs were trembling a little.Even though he was scared, he tried to look strong in case Yeon-woo was coming with the intention of harming him.However, that only gave Yeon-woo the impression of a rain-soaked puppy with its tail erect in front of a tiger.Yeon-woo stood before the young man and asked in a blunt tone.\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cKnow what?\u201dThe bridge of the young man\u2019s nose wrinkled.\u201cThe fact that the puppet was operating through a sensor. I\u2019m asking how you knew this.\u201d\u201cWhat? That\u2019s\u2026.\u201dFor a moment, the young man couldn\u2019t answer properly.But Yeon-woo didn\u2019t rush him.He stared patiently until the young man gave the right answer.\u2018This player, he\u2019s one of those guys who had been raiding the boss room for a long time. Where did the others go?\u2019During the six days he spent on Section A, there was a team that got their feet bound by the scarecrows and was stuck in the boss room.At that time, he wasn\u2019t interested, so he didn\u2019t really pay attention to them. But now, everyone else was gone except for this guy.He thought for a moment that they might have died while dealing with the copper puppet, but it didn\u2019t seem like it. There wasn\u2019t any trace of corpses, only those of someone eating by himself.\u2018I see, he\u2019s been abandoned.\u2019Occasionally, there had been cases like this.Cases of team members being ruthlessly discarded throughout the tutorial due to their uselessness. On Earth, people would point their fingers at this irrational behavior, but it didn\u2019t matter here.Within the tutorial, where players were focused on making achievements, it only natural to party up out of necessity rather than being acquainted.That\u2019s exactly what happened to this young man.The young man was on guard against Yeon-woo, but Yeon-woo could see just by looking at him that he was too weak.His eyes were filled with embarrassment while looking at Yeon-woo. He wanted to run away from this situation, but he couldn\u2019t because there were too many scarecrows around.Yeon-woo began to wonder how did the young man think he would be able to enter The Tower and how did he get his qualifications to participate in the tutorial.Consequently, Yeon-woo was just going to ignore him and leave him be.In the first place, he didn\u2019t care about anything except advancing through the tutorial and catching up with the frontrunners.There was no reason to go out of his way and do something troublesome.But the words the young man had shouted while he was dealing with the copper puppet grabbed his attention.That the copper puppets were operating via sensors.Yeon-woo was barely aware of it thanks to his enhanced senses, and he thought it was something the average players would never notice.So Yeon-woo was wondering how he knew about it.For someone who appeared to be so weak.Usually, the truth was very simple.He could have noticed a pattern in the copper puppet\u2019s movements after being trapped in the boss room for a long time, and made a guess out of it.Or,\u2018He could have read the flow of mana inside the copper puppet when it operated.\u2019\u2018Magic power\u2019It was Mana.It was an unsolved problem that haunted Yeon-woo.Yeon-woo stared at the young man for some time.After mumbling for a while, he finally spat some words out.\u201cI\u2026 I saw it.\u201d\u201cYou saw it?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 the threads of mana\u2026 surrounding the copper puppet\u2026.\u201dIn the middle of the conversation, an idea crossed Yeon-woo\u2019s mind. So he immediately activated his Draconic Eyes.The pupils of his eyes sank deeply, and eyes resembling those of reptiles were revealed.\u201cHup!\u201dThe young man gasped in surprise.Vertical slit pupils rose under the white mask. It wasn\u2019t strange to be scared.Ignoring his reaction, Yeon-woo examined him from head to toes.Then he chuckled.\u201cWhy did you put on this look?\u201dFor a second, the young man flinched.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe look you have right now. It\u2019s a disguise.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe young man\u2019s face stiffened.Yeon-woo put more power into his draconic eyes.Then, a very small presence was revealed inside the dozens of flaws surrounding the young man.\u201cAre you around 10 years old? You\u2019re really young. Very small too. But it\u2019s too blurry to recognize your face. You\u2019re not a normal human, are you?\u201dThe young man clenched his teeth and moved his hand towards the sword he had left on the floor. He was ready to pick it up if necessary.\u201cWhat are you planning to do with me?\u201dIt was a sudden question.Yeon-woo tilted his head as he could not understand the situation.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI said, what are you planning on doing with me?\u201d\u201cYou? Why?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2026.\u201dThe young man was going to say something, but he managed to bite his tongue and shut his mouth. He was reluctant to say any more.Yeon-woo snorted at him.\u201cI know what you mean, but I don\u2019t care who you are or what you look like.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cWhat I\u2019m interested in is how you can \u201csee\u201d and handle mana. I\u2019m just curious about the how. So, can you tell me?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe young man opened his eyes widely.Yeon-woo nodded toward the exit.\u201cOf course I wouldn\u2019t ask you to tell me for free. I see you\u2019ve been stuck here for quite some time. Then, I\u2019ll help you out. You can\u2019t get any food or attend to any business in here. How does that sound? It\u2019s not bad for you either, is it?\u201dThe young man\u2019s eyes were filled with confusion. Everything he had said was just unbelievable.\u201cIf there are other reasons you can\u2019t tell, or if you think it\u2019s not a fair trade, well, I can\u2019t help it.\u201dYeon-woo thought it would be a great opportunity if he could learn how to handle mana from this young man.The ability to see mana.That meant that he had an extreme affinity to mana even amongst those who knew how to handle it.If Yeon-woo could acquire such ability, it would be very helpful for him in order to learn how to handle mana.Above of all, even if it was a secret that he wasn\u2019t allowed to randomly pass onto others, it would be easy to dig it out from him since he was dealing with a child.As for the rest, it wasn\u2019t of his concern.Of course, if the young man used this as an opportunity to ask for something preposterous, he was going to immediately decline. Even if not now, he should still be able find a way to handle mana later on.Seeing as no answer came from the young man, Yeon-woo took his attention off of him and turned around.\u201cIt seems like you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cWa,wait! Hold on for a second.\u201dYeon-woo looked back at the young man.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cAbout what you were saying, is it true? You really don\u2019t know how to handle mana?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any reason to lie, do I?\u201d\u201cN\u2026no way! Are you saying you did that without mana?\u201dThe young man looked around Yeon-woo with an incredulous look. Chunks of the broken copper puppet could be seen.A monster he had tried so hard to defeat with his teammates, but wouldn\u2019t even budge an inch.It was a puppet that survived through tons of skills and attacks without even a scratch.But Yeon-woo, with only a few attacks, had just destroyed the puppet and was now saying he didn\u2019t know how to handle mana.It was simply incomprehensible, it was beyond common sense.On the other hand, Yeon-woo also could not understand the young man.\u201cWell, I just did.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe young man recalled a man from his hometown who once painted a wonderful landscape and said, \u2018It\u2019s that easy\u2019.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tutorial (7)Yeon-woo stared at the young man as if asking what was wrong with it.The young man seemed to have a lot to say, but he kept his mouth shut.He was thinking this was a chance. His only chance to get out of this awful place.His eyes then filled with determination.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll help you. What do you want me to do?\u201d* \u00a0*\u00a0 *The young man presented himself as Yul.\u201cYul?\u201d\u201cYes, Yul. Everyone calls me by that name.\u201dYeon-woo noticed that it was an alias, but he didn\u2019t bother asking any more.After all, they would part ways after getting what they needed from each other.\u201cAll right, Yul. I\u2019ll open up a path so follow right behind me.

I\u2019m not gonna let you off just because you\u2019re a child.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dYul thought it was no longer necessary to act strong since he had already failed to conceal his age, so he answered with an \u2018Okay\u2019.Still, as if his stubbornness ran in his blood, he didn\u2019t want to appear weak until the end.With his Draconic Eyes active, Yeon-woo took the lead and walked along the passage. Every time they advanced a certain distance, a copper puppet would come out and block their way. Taking the same posture as Yeon-woo, the puppets tried to attack them. But each time, Yeon-woo pushed them aside and stabbed the dagger into their flaws.*Kwang*Whenever Yeon-woo brandished his dagger, one or two of the copper puppet\u2019s limbs popped into the air.Sometimes, broken fragments of their heads fell onto the floor.If until now he had been focusing on speed, now his focus changed to clashing head-on with the copper puppets and knocking them down.After switching to it, he realized this method was better. He was able to figure out some clues about new ways to use his senses with his now stronger muscles.During the whole time he was following Yeon-woo, Yul couldn\u2019t hold his mouth from gaping.Whenever Yeon-woo swung his ordinary dagger, the monstrous copper puppets exploded into pieces.He was beginning doubt whether they were the same puppets he had fought before.Then, Yeon-woo looked back at him.A look asking why he hadn\u2019t started speaking yet.Only then did Yul came to his sense and opened his mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I can \u201csee\u201d mana inherently.\u201d\u201cInherently?\u201dFor a moment, Yeon-woo stopped walking and narrowed his eyes.\u201cIs this something related to your bloodline(\u8840\u7cfb)?\u201d\u201cIt is similar.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dCases like this were scarce on Earth, but could be often found in other worlds.Cases of individuals possessing some Unique Talent(\u7570\u80fd) or maybe even a Supernatural Power(\u8d85\u80fd) were associated to genetic factors.They usually had an outstanding ancestor, and their abilities had been passed down to their descendants generation after generation.Then, the descendants would awaken their abilities during their lifetime, rise to prominence, and continue passing down their abilities to their offsprings. This was also the case for Yul.\u201cThe ability I inherited is something along the lines of affinity towards mana, which allows me to see, to feel and to taste mana. That\u2019s how I found out that the copper puppets had sensors attached to them.\u201dYeon-woo fell into a deep thought for a while.\u2018Isn\u2019t this similar to Jeong-woo?\u2019The trait his brother had, Psychometry.To be able to communicate with everything, also meant that he could communicate with mana.Naturally, his brother didn\u2019t have any complication when feeling mana, unlike other people from Earth who commonly struggle with it.Rather, he could even handle mana very smoothly, as if he had just recovered something he had once lost.It was said that his teammates were appalled after seeing that.The reason why he was chosen by the Ancient Dragon Kalatus was all because of that characteristic of his.Because he could communicate with all things, it was possible for him to inherit the abilities of the dragon race that ordinary humans couldn\u2019t grasp.Therefore, the description of mana his brother had left in his diary was not very helpful to Yeon-woo.The whole concept was something Yeon-woo couldn\u2019t rely on, like a pie in the sky.The same went for Yul.The bloodline inheritance and the awakening of abilities through traits, they both sounded the same too Yeon-woo.\u2018Technically, these two people can be classified as geniuses, which I am not.\u2019Yeon-woo was starting to think that the deal he had made with Yul would end up being of little help to him.However, the next comment Yul made caught Yeon-woo\u2019s attention.\u201cYou can consider mana as some kind of river. Magic would be the water drawn from the river to a reservoir.\u201dYeon-woo repeated to himself in a low voice.\u201cA reservoir?\u201dSomething kept hovering in his head and jumbled up his thoughts.In the meantime, Yeon-woo had already defeated the last remaining copper puppet and was approaching the iron gate leading to Section B.* \u00a0*\u00a0 *[You have successfully cleared Section A as a solo player.][You have made an achievement that is not easily accomplished. Additional Karma will be provided.][You have acquired 500 Karma.][You have acquired 300 additional Karma.][Your health and mana will be restored][All status effects will be removed]\u2018Fortunately, we weren\u2019t recognized as a team.\u2019Looking at the pile of messages, Yeon-woo cracked a slight smile.The interface system marked everything as Yeon-woo\u2019s achievements, presumably because the copper puppets were taken care of by Yeon-woo without any help from Yul whatsoever.\u2018I got 800 points from that.\u2019In The Tower, the concept of Karma was very important.Karma, a scoring system given according to a player\u2019s achievements.The Tower and the Guardians provided rewards based on Karma, and it was also used as a currency amongst players and could be traded for other items.Basically, it was something that every player had to do their best to gather as much as possible throughout the Tower.But Yeon-woo, who had just passed Section A of the tutorial, had already gained this much Karma. Others would be shocked if they knew it.\u2018It\u2019s not enough yet, I need to accumulate more. As much as possible.\u2019Yeon-woo closed the Karma window, and stepped into the waiting room of Section B.A refreshing air entered his lungs.\u201cWh\u2026 who\u2019s that guy? What\u2019s up with his mask?\u201d\u201cHe just passed Section A, right?\u201d\u201cWhat? At a time like this?\u201d\u201cHold on, where are the other guys? Is he alone?\u201dBeyond the iron gate, there were about a dozen people looking at his direction in amazement.It was surprising that there were still participants attempting to pass even after two weeks[1] from when the tutorial started.It was a common knowledge that people entering The Tower this time around, would usually wait for the next round instead of barging in in the middle.But what surprised them even more was that it was only one person that opened the iron gate and entered Section B.They wondered if he had broken through the vicious Section A on his own\u201cWhat are you doing? Aren\u2019t you coming in?\u201dYeon-woo said as he looked back.Then, Yul crossed the iron gate in disbelief. His faintly trembling lips muttered in a low voice.\u201cFinally, I\u2019m out\u2026.\u201dIt was a voice mixed with several emotions.[You have entered Section B]The waiting room in Section B was quite large.The room was shaped like a dome and it seemed large enough to accommodate thousands of people.There were quite a number of people inside the waiting room, and each of them was doing something different.Some were sharpening their swords with whetstones, and some were doing some warm-up exercises. There were also some sleeping in one corner, while others were seriously injured with amputated limbs.Excluding Yul, they were the first \u2018people\u2019 he met since arriving at The Tower.But Yeon-woo ignored all the glances they were throwing at him.\u2018Because they\u2019re all dropouts.\u2019They were those who couldn\u2019t think of moving forward any more after barely passing through the grisly Section A.Every one of them had given up on the challenges and were waiting for the 30 days time limit to end.Unlike its definition of \u201cuser\u2019s instructions\u201d, the tutorial is a dangerous place where players can actually die if they don\u2019t pull themselves together.There were a lot of people in the waiting room of Section B who had managed to overcome the dangers but found themselves disheartened.They had lost their companions and their loved ones in front of their eyes, and succumbed to the fear of death. Even I would be tired too.The tutorial becomes more and more difficult as players continue to progress.Of course, it was inevitable that many players would decide to drop out, so if he paid too much attention to them it would only make him distracted.Yeon-woo moved to a vacant area. Fortunately, he was able to find a bench with no one nearby.Then he called Yul who was standing nailed to the spot.\u201cYul.\u201d\u201cHuh? Yes!\u201dHe was glaring at one side with blazing eyes. Then, he got startled and turned to Yeon-woo.\u201cLet\u2019s finish our talk first.\u201d\u201cAh, yes!\u201dYul gave one more angry look to that side, and quickly approached Yeon-woo and sat down opposite to him.Yeon-woo glanced towards where Yul had been looking.Four players were gathered around that place. They had a stern look on their faces.\u201cAre they your teammates?\u201d\u201cThey \u2018were\u2019. But not anymore.\u201dYul\u2019s expression was cold.They had left him at the jaws of death. It was natural to be angry.But Yul didn\u2019t seem to want to get involved with them anymore.Trash is only a trash, and it won\u2019t do any good to get tied up with a trash.Yeon-woo was quite fond of that kind of attitude.There\u2019s a fine line between revenge and foolhardiness.Knowing to differentiate objectively between them meant that he had a lot of room for growth.\u201cWhere was I?\u201d\u201cMana stream, or whatever.\u201d\u201cOh, about that\u2026.\u201dTo his surprise, Yul knew a lot about mana.To be exact, he knew a lot about the theory.In most cases, those who had inherited magical abilities were often weak with theory, but Yul said he was forced to study the from an early age because of his family\u2019s policies.Thanks to him, Yeon-woo was able to roughly conceptualize magic and mana.It was still hard to understand most of the theory. But as things were beginning to take shape in his mind, it made it possible for him to take in, to a certain extent, what Jeong-woo had written in his diary.\u201cSo.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI got a rough idea of what mana is, but if I can\u2019t use it, it\u2019s completely useless. What\u2019s an easy way to handle, I mean, use mana?\u201d\u201cUhm, Well\u2026.\u201dYul scratched the back of the head.\u201cI don\u2019t really know. It feels refreshing, I guess? In fact, I\u2019ve been able to handle it from the start, so it\u2019s hard to explain how.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Well, it is what it is.\u201dYeon-woo nodded as if he already knew it.He had already guessed it since he felt Yul was similar to his brother.But that didn\u2019t mean that there was no progress at all.At least he was able to relieve the vague feeling he had.That alone was a great harvest.He hadn\u2019t lost anything from the deal since he only needed to bring Yul along with him to Section B, which was where he was headed to anyway.\u201cThen I\u2019ll take my leave here. You\u2019re going to wait for the tutorial to end and then go back, right?\u201d\u201cYes? Ah, yes.\u201dYul seemed to have something to say as he saw Yeon-woo rising from his seat, but he just silently nodded.Even if he wanted to get to The Tower, only those who attained the highest scores during the tutorial were eligible to enter, so there was no way he could.Still, Yul showed a slightly regretful face.Yeon-woo, however, turned his back only leaving him a short goodbye.He had only passed Section A. There were still five sections[2] remaining until Section F, so it was necessary to quickly narrow the gap between him and the frontrunners, and make up for the time lost.It was at that moment, when Yeon-woo was about to take his leave, when he suddenly saw four players headed towards his direction.They were the group that had abandoned Yul.[1] Says one week in the original, but should be the author\u2019s mistake.[2] At this point I just assume the author is bad at maths. Says six sections in the original.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tutorial (8)\u201cYul.\u201dA man stepped forward.The man appeared to be their leader.A handsome figure with a strong physique. He was a swordsman carrying a big sword on his waist.Yul looked at them with a curl on his lips.\u201cWhat is it? Do we still have things to talk about?\u201d\u201cHow did you\u2026.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need to tell you how I got out from there now, do I?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe man couldn\u2019t say anything.His eyes were filled with confusion.The teammate who had only been a burden and therefore was left behind in the middle of the boss room, had now come back alive.He didn\u2019t know what to make of this situation.Yul didn\u2019t hide his hostility towards them. Yet, he wasn\u2019t stupid enough to reveal his murderous intent.Even though he was seething with anger, he knew that in this world power dictates everything. And Yul did not have the power to take revenge on them for now.Ignoring them was the right answer.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to say, but please, fuck off. I know you don\u2019t even want to see me, \u2018cause just looking at you also makes me sick. So let\u2019s just pretend we don\u2019t know each other until the tutorial is over. As you know, I don\u2019t have any power to do anything to you guys anyway, do I?\u201dBut despite his rambling, the four of them just stood there hesitating.They showed no sign of leaving Yul alone. Rather, they were busy looking at each other.\u201cWhat the hell are you guys waiting for?\u201dYul scowled at them as his patience ran out.At last, prompted by the glares of the other three, the leader bit his lower lip and suddenly bent his waist.\u201cBy any means possible, we want to apologize for what happened before.\u201dYul\u2019s expression became completely distorted.\u201cWhat is this bullshit?\u201d\u201cAnd also, I have a favor to ask you.\u201d\u201cA favor?\u201d\u201cWhat happened at that time, would you keep it a secret?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to\u2026 sorry, I can\u2019t tell you the details, but what happened between us, please don\u2019t talk about it with anyone else. We\u2019re begging you.\u201dThe other three also bowed down.\u201cPlease do us this favor.\u201d\u201cYul, please.\u201d\u201cFor old time\u2019s sake, think of what we used to be.\u201dYul kept his mouth shut.Watching them bowing down, Yul could still remember the incident playing like a video in his head.In the boss room, where their team had struggled several days to pass through, Yul was told that he was useless and was cast as a bait.He begged them, asking how could they do this to him and cried out for help, but they didn\u2019t even think of looking back and ruthlessly went on their way.When he first met them in the waiting room of Section A, he thought he had met some really nice teammates.They were all polite, and they were quite skilled.And although he had been repeatedly warned by the elders of his family that The Tower was a dangerous world, they were people who had made him think otherwise.But such expectations were shattered.\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about, but get the hell out of here. I don\u2019t want to see your faces anymore.\u201dThen Yul quickly turned his back.The leader was vexed and bit his lower lip.\u2018This won\u2019t do. If I leave things go like this, the opportunity might vanish into thin air.\u201dTheir leader, Kaen, had some complicated feelings inside.Just as they got out of Section A, he had thought his hellish life was finally over.Although the fact that they had thrown Yul as a bait to divert the copper doll\u2019s attention troubled him, he thought of it as an inevitable sacrifice in order to save more lives.Most importantly, Yul\u2019s ability simply allowed him to read the flow of mana.He wasn\u2019t playing a big part in the raid, so even if he dropped out, it wouldn\u2019t have much of an impact on the team\u2019s strength.In fact, he believed that things were fine as long as he could save more people at the expense of Yul\u2019s sacrifice.So Kaen led his teammates forward and went directly to find the man in the waiting room of Section B.Bild.It was the name of the player who had tried to recruit them before the tutorial had started.\u201cWe\u2019re called Arangdan. You guys, I like the look in your eyes. Usually, people with that kind of look show great prospects. Come with us. I\u2019ll be at the waiting room of Section B, come find me anytime if you want to join us.\u201dAt first, they thought he was some kind of freak and didn\u2019t think much of him.But they found out much later, that Arangdan was a big name in the tutorial.It was the top clan that had been practically dominating the tutorial for a long time.Apparently, Arangdan had some connections in The Tower, or that\u2019s what he had heard.Arangdan was like a vigilante group, formed to prevent chaos within the tutorial.They tried to prevent all kinds of tricks and cheats, and create a stage where players could play fair and square.As a result, the selection of their members was strictly managed.Everything was carefully and meticulously examined, whether the volunteer had done any bad deed, whether they had attempted to threaten or rob an ordinary person, and so on.As such, for Kaen and his party the sudden return of Yul was like a bolt out of the blue.\u2018Damn it, if Yul spills the secret somewhere\u2026!\u2019He was supposed to meet with Bild this evening.Kaen\u2019s group had already mentioned that Yul \u201cvoluntarily\u201d sacrificed himself in order to save them.But what if he spoiled their plan?Everything would be over.\u2018There\u2019s a rumor that Arangdan is under direct control of a giant guild in The Tower. If we lose their favor now, we\u2019ll be in real trouble.\u2019Rumors said that Arangdan was specifically created by a clan in The Tower in order to find potential recruits for their clan.Kaen didn\u2019t want to miss this opportunity.But despite their apology, Yul seemed to be not listening at all.He turned his back on them as if he didn\u2019t want to see them.\u2018If I just\u2026.\u2019Then Kaen gritted his teeth. His eyes were full of malice.It was only hard to betray for the first time. It wasn\u2019t hard for the second time.Kaen signaled his teammates with his eyes.It meant to cover him from outside exposure.Fortunately for him, no one was looking at this corner of the room.\u2018It\u2019s easy to get rid of the corpse. Bild doesn\u2019t know Yul\u2019s face anyway. Attributing the cause of death to the damage suffered in the boss room will be enough.\u2019His teammates were puzzled and worried about whether they should go this far, but they had no choice but to take action, as Kaen continued to signal them.And then, Kaen carefully moved his hand towards the handle of his sword.He was going to finish this quickly.However,\u201cIt is said that there is a clan in the tutorial that directly belongs to Cheonghwado(\u9751\u82b1\u5cf6), named Arangdan, and that Cheonghwado tends to recruit newbies from Arangdan. But they\u2019re so particular about recruiting that they only want spotless people. Even if they themselves aren\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 Kuaak!\u201dThe sudden voice that came from behind startled Kaen. He tried to pull his sword out, but instead, let out a scream.A terrible pain reverberated across his arm.His right hand fell down on the floor, dripping with blood.\u201cMy hand! My haaand!\u201dKaen screamed as he held onto his right wrist.Only then did Yul notice something strange and quickly looked back.With eyes filled with confusion, the other teammates also drew their swords and pointed them towards their back.There stood Yeon-woo, shaking off the blood from his dagger.\u201cIf you have the malice to go after someone else\u2019s back, of course you should be prepared to lose one of your hands.\u201d* \u00a0 * \u00a0 *Underneath the mask, Yeon-woo was slightly frowning.\u2018Why did I get myself involved in this shit. I feel like crap now.\u2019Originally, he should have ignored it and moved straight on to Section B.But for some reason, his feet didn\u2019t move from the spot.It was because the image of Yul was kept appearing in his head.To be precise, it was the image of Yul being betrayed by his teammates.\u2018Betrayal\u2026.\u2019Yul\u2019s face kept overlapping with someone he knew.It was his brother who had been backstabbed by his teammates.Yul was in the same box. And the ones who had betrayed him once, even went out of their way to find Yul again.What did this mean?Usually in cases like this, people were afraid of leaving behind a weakness that could be exploited.Yeon-woo knew this too well.That\u2019s why he stayed behind just to see what they were doing, and ended up witnessing such a filthy and dirty sight.In his mind, he wanted to rinse his eyes with running water.\u201cMy hand! My haaand! You son of a bitch! How dare you!\u201dKaen cried out as he grabbed his severed right hand and his face contorted. He stared at Yeon-woo with a menacing look.\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201dHis other teammates were also pointing their swords at Yeonwoo.But they couldn\u2019t think of rushing in.No one had noticed what happened until they saw Kaen\u2019s hand flying.\u2018He\u2019s an expert!\u2019Cold sweat streamed down their backs.They knew that Yeon-woo was the one who saved Yul, but they thought he only happened to help him on his way.And even if he helped Yul fight them, they thought they could easily take him down with numbers.But they were wrong.Yeon-woo gave an indifferent smile.\u201cTry as hard as you can.\u201d\u201cYou bastard!\u201dKaen bolted forward with eyes filled with madness. He drew his sword with his left hand and swung it towards Yeon-woo\u2019s neck.\u201cKaen!\u201dHis teammates called out his name in surprise.They weren\u2019t sure how skilled Yeon-woo was, and if he clashed with Yeon-woo right now, their admission to Arangdan could end up being sabotaged.But none of their words reached Kaen\u2019s ears. He was lost in revenge.Yeon-woo strode forward.He was thinking of how to deal with these guys.They were the kind who had no qualms when putting a knife on someone else\u2019s back, but can\u2019t stand when they\u2019re the one being stabbed.He was definitely feeling shitty.*Pat*Yeon-woo dodged the sword coming for his head and moved to Kaen\u2019s back. He stretched out his arm and wrapped it around Kaen\u2019s arm. All in a split second.Then he lightly twisted Kaen\u2019s arm in a backward direction.*Crack*Kaen\u2019s left arm bent in a strange angle.\u201cKuaak!\u201dNot caring about his cries, Yeon-woo did a flip with his arm still wrapped around him and climbed onto Kaen\u2019s shoulder.It was a shrewd move just like a cat\u2019s.Then, with a hard motion of his foot, he broke Kaen\u2019s shoulder.*Crunch*\u201cAak! AAAAAK!\u201d\u201cKaen!\u201d\u201cY, you son of a bitch!\u201d\u201cLet him go!\u201d*Clang*The sword fell down helplessly to the floor.Kaen couldn\u2019t withstand the pain and knelt down on the ground.In the meantime, his teammates still couldn\u2019t approach him.Yeon-woo was too nimble, and he was riding on Kaen\u2019s shoulders.Yeon-woo twisted Kaen\u2019s bizarrely bent arm behind his back, placed one foot over his spine and put his weight on it.He was threatening to destroy Kaen\u2019s back if they approached any closer.\u201cKeuuk!\u201dKaren\u2019s eyes were bloodshot as if they were going to pop out at any moment.\u201cCome at me now. I\u2019ll make sure he will never be able to walk again.\u201dUnderneath the mask, Yeon-woo\u2019s eyes shimmered with a cold glow.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tutorial (9)The moment they met Yeon-woo\u2019s fierce eyes, Kaen\u2019s teammates froze in place.Just looking at his eyes that seem devoid of emotion made their legs tremble involuntarily.\u201cWh-why are you doing this! You have n-nothing to do with this guy! Wh-why are you interrupting us?\u201dOne of them gathered up his courage and shouted at Yeon-woo.Players usually did not to interfere with each other\u2019s business. It was an unwritten rule in tutorial.They all had different standings and different circumstances around their troubles.And dislike towards other people meddling in their affairs was a common characteristic between players with strong personal tendencies.So technically, Yeon-woo had no reason to intervene in the matter.But Yeon-woo bluntly said.\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d\u201cWh-what?\u201d\u201cI said I don\u2019t like it. Do you have any problem with that?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dYeon-woo sneered at them.\u201cYou guys are doing whatever you please, so who says I can\u2019t?\u201dThey wanted to scream against such nonsense.But the menacing eyes floating behind the mask made them unable to say anything anymore.They had a hunch that they might get into a huge mess if they went on like this.Yeon-woo spoke.\u201cPut your weapons down.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d*Crack*\u201cAAAK!\u201d\u201cPut them down.\u201d\u201cDo it! Throw it away! Please!\u201dEventually, Kaen couldn\u2019t hold it any longer and started to scream.The three began to abandon their weapons one by one while looking at each other.*Clang* *Clang*\u201cO-okay now, let Kaen go.\u201dOne of them said in a trembling voice, as he stayed on alert against Yeon-woo.At that moment,*Sneer*\u201cIdiots.\u201dYeon-woo gave them a sneer and pressed his foot harder, breaking Kaen\u2019s spine.*Kung*Kaen\u2019s eyes rolled back, as he dropped down on the floor.He was still breathing, but it was clear he couldn\u2019t move his limbs any more.\u201cTh, that\u2019s different from what you promised\u2026 Awk!\u201dOne of shouted as his face turned pale and gasped in surprise.Before he knew it, Yeon-woo had already thrown a dagger at him.He barely managed to strike the dagger.In the meantime, Yeon-woo quickly approached him and smacked his throat with knife-hand strike.Yeon-woo then darted close to him, smashed his chest with his elbow, struck his sternum with his knee, and punched his stomach.*Kwang**Crunch*His muscles were ruptured and all the struck bones were destroyed, accompanied by an air bursting sound. His jaw was crushed, and three or four teeth were chipped.*Drip*In the end, he collapsed on the floor covered in blood.He was barely gasping for air. He looked like he could completely stop breathing at any time.\u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you!\u201d\u201cJust die already!\u201dAt that moment, the other two people ran from behind Yeon-woo and swung their swords towards his neck and waist.It was their last ditch effort.Two of their teammates had collapsed without inflicting any damage. There was no chance of running away, so at the very least, they tried to oppose some resistance.Yeon-woo lowered himself close to ground to avoid the attacks and simultaneously drew his dagger from his waist and slashed in front of him.*Shluk* *Shluk*\u201cWAAK!\u201d\u201cAAAK! My foot!\u201dThe two dropped onto the floor as their achilles tendons and arteries were cut.And then.*Puck* *Puck*As a fist flew towards their faces, their two heads were completely knocked backwards.*Gurgle*Their mouths were full of foam mixed with blood.Yul\u2019s jaw dropped as he watched the situation.Everything happened so fast.Even though unsightly, they still were players who had somehow passed Section A on their own.But Yeon-woo crushed not just two, but four of them at once.He knew Yeon-woo was strong, but he didn\u2019t think he would be so overwhelming.The four seemed unable to make a comeback any longer, unless someone took them to a High Priest, or brought them a Superior Healing Potion.If they were to be left like this, they might die or end up crippled for the rest of their lives.It had to be either one of these two, the latter being more likely.Yul felt so much relief, not because they were dead, but because they had to live like that until they died.So he wanted to express his gratitude.Yeon-woo was calm and composed as if he had just gone for a stroll.He shook off some of the blood from his dagger, roughly put it around his waist and looked back at Yul.\u201cYou\u2019re drooling.\u201dYul hastily wiped around his mouth with his sleeve.*Chuckle*Just now, Yul had just heard Yeon-woo laughing.Yul raised his head with his eyes wide open.He had been wearing a mask and his eyes had been dull up until now, so Yul had thought he didn\u2019t have any emotion.He had heard a few sneers, but he had never heard Yeon-woo\u2019s real laugh.But Yeon-woo turned his back as if nothing happened.\u201cTake care of yourself. Watch out for other people from now on.\u201d\u201cUh, uh, wait\u2026.\u201dWithout thinking, Yul called out for Yeon-woo.But Yeon-woo just went his own way without looking back.So Yul urgently shouted.\u201cTh-thank you! Hyung! Someday I\u2019m gonna be like you!\u201dYul thought to himself that he wanted to get rid of his weak self and become strong like this person.Suddenly, Yeon-woo stopped for a moment and turned his head back.Yul flinched for a moment, wondering if he had made a mistake.\u201cTry going to the Freesia Garden.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be quite helpful to you.\u201dYeon-woo just left these words behind and waved goodbye without saying anything else.Yul stood there for a moment with a blank expression, but soon got a grasp of what he meant and clenched his fists.\u2018Freesia Garden, was it?\u2019As if he had made a pledge to himself, he turned his gaze to another side of the room.*\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0 \u00a0*\u201cOh! Would you look at that?\u201dIn a place with a lot of dropouts, a\u00a0man who had been crouching in one corner and yawning from time to time, exclaimed with admiration.Disheveled hair, rustic clothes, and a fishy look. He wasn\u2019t a person who left a strong impression on others.But his look completely changed once he found something interesting near the gate.It was like the look of a kid who had found a fun toy.\u201cHey, hey. Stop sleeping and get up.\u201d\u201cHaaam! You won\u2019t even let me sleep. So, what is it? \u201dThe young man with disheveled hair kicked the boy who was tossing and turning.Then the young boy with a baby-faced look got up and made a slight frown as he rubbed his eyes.Bed head and sleepy eyes.However, he had a pretty face that would make anyone stand in awe.\u00a0If it weren\u2019t for his Adam\u2019s apple, people would have believed he was a girl.\u201cDid you see that?\u201d\u201cSee what?\u201d\u201cWell, the guys who were boasting about their admission to Arangdan, they just got beaten up.\u201d\u201cHaaam.\u201dThe boy yawned.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201dWe expected it would happen since they went around being all being haughty about it. I knew they\u2019d get beaten up someday. And hey, they weren\u2019t all that great.The boy was about to say this, but as the young man added the next sentence, he could only stare at him wide-eyed.\u201cThey were beaten up by a single guy.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHis sleepy eye suddenly flashed.\u201cAll by one guy?\u201d\u201cYup. I think he passed Section A all by himself too.\u201dThe boy gave a small exclamation saying \u2018Oh!\u2019, and put on a timid smile as he looked at the gate leading to Section A.It was such a cute smile that would even make men\u2019s heart flutter.\u201cReally? At a time like this? That\u2019s great~ I thought there would be no more people. But that Kaen or whatever was pretty good.\u201dThen the boy cutely tilted his head.\u201cBut you said the guy just screwed with Arangdan, so Cheonghwa is gonna go nuts about it, right?\u201dThe young man gave a wicked laughter.\u201cTo be exact, They were just candidates. Hehe. But still, I came here without expecting much, but now I\u2019ve seen something fun right from the start. So, what do you think?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAbout making him our team member. Don\u2019t you think he is okay? Playing solo means he doesn\u2019t belong to any other team yet. I don\u2019t think there will be anyone else like this.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m not convinced yet. It\u2019s too bothersome to clash with Cheonghwa.\u201d\u201cHa! Since when did you care about that?\u201d\u201cHeehee. That\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cIn any case. Just to check him out again, should we go after him?\u201d\u201cHyung, that\u2019s a bad habit.\u201d\u201cSo? You\u2019re not coming?\u201dThe boy puffed out his cheeks in response to the young man\u2019s question.\u201cI didn\u2019t say no.\u201dThen, he timidly smiled.\u201cDon\u2019t you know I like this kind of stuff a lot more than you do? Hehe.\u201d*\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0 \u00a0*\u2018He said, thank you\u2026.\u2019Yeon-woo chuckled as he recalled to Yul\u2019s words.He had a long way to go, but he didn\u2019t mind this kind of little connection just for some refreshment.Moreover, he had peeked into Yul\u2019s bloodline ability with his Draconic Eyes.He was an Enchanter.\u2018It\u2019s an ability that lets him imbue a person or equipment with mana. I didn\u2019t think I would see this kind of thing here.\u2019*Chuckle*He felt drawn to such a unique ability that was hard to find even in The Tower.\u2018If I could keep him close to me\u2026.\u2019It would be of big help in the future.\u2018Of course, that\u2019s only if he can get through here safely.\u2019Yeon-woo couldn\u2019t erase the smile from his face every time he recalled Yul\u2019s earnest look.\u2018By the way,\u2019Yeon-woo stopped and looked around for a moment.\u2018Where is the passage that leads to Section B?\u2019He didn\u2019t know if it was because of the fight with the Kaen\u2019s group, but he could feel the players around looking at him. He ignored them and passed through the center of the waiting room.At the end of the wall on his right side, four doors stood in a row.As he walked past a yellow line which meant the starting zone of Section B, a message automatically popped up on his retina.[The challenge of Section B will begin.][Section B has a total of four passages. Select one door and clear the passage.]At the end of huge vacant lot laid four doors in a straight line.Each one of them was the same in size and shape, but had a different in color.\u2018I\u2019m going to choose,\u2019White, blue, red and black.\u2018Black.\u2019Yeon-woo scanned through each door and headed towards the door at the far right without any hesitation.The waiting room in Section B was definitely a place full of dropouts. But I can\u2019t give up like them. I already promised with my friends to get out of here safely. I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s having hard time in here, so I can\u2019t back out.Instead, I was instructed to select one out of four doors, so I did\u2026 But later, I regretted my decision.\u2018Jeong-woo\u2019s choice was blue.\u2019Each door was designed to guide the players to a different room with a set difficulty level. The further to the right, the more difficult it would be.His brother had chosen the second easiest door.Section A had already been too hard, therefore he and his teammates decided to choose a relatively easier door in order to take a breather.But after a long time, when he was already somewhat settled in The Tower and learned about the secrets of the tutorial, he regretted the choice he had made in Section B.The rewards differed depending on the color of the door selected in Section B.\u201cBehind the black door, also known as the \u2018Black Route\u2019, there are White Mosses and Cannibals waiting inside.\u201dSection A only tested the players\u2019 physical performance.But it was little bit different in Section B.It required something else.Judgment, cognition, attention, concentration, determination, etc.Their decision making, thoughts and course of action that different players make when faced with the same environment. Even how much they knew about the situation they were in.And finally, the ability to find the hidden pieces that the Guardians had concealed as if it was a treasure hunt, relying on the abilities mentioned above.\u2018I must get my hands on Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword here.\u2019As Yeon-woo recalled the location of hidden piece in Section B, he slowly placed his hand on the black door.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Black Route (1)[You have entered the Black Route.][Safely go across the pond and reach the opposite side.]Yeon-woo wiped some of the blood from his dagger and placed it back next to his waist.Maybe because he hadn\u2019t experienced any bloodshed for a while, he now felt like his whole body was burning with excitement.\u2018It was useful to some degree.\u2019Although it was just a clash against some small fry, it had been worth the try.Clearly, Yeon-woo was still lacking in some departments, be it in terms of skills or abilities.\u2018Experience.\u2019The experience of going through life or death situations on the battlefield, the instincts taught by those very ordeals, and the determination required.Those were never easy to come by.Yeon-woo had an accurate grasp of his strengths and weaknesses.\u201cSkill and ability are areas I can catch up on. I don\u2019t need to be in a hurry. I just have to continue advancing as I\u2019ve been doing up till now. I am not wrong.\u2019Yeon-woo took a look around while organizing his thoughts.\u2018So this is the Black Route, the hardest difficulty.\u2019The Black Route had a very simple layout.Along the wide cavity, there was a huge pond.\u2018Are you telling me to get through here?\u2019The pond stretched over the long curvy cavity.It seemed the goal was to swim across this pond.[Pond of Heavyweight Water (\u5343\u91cd\u6c34)]The pond is made of water that giant Mimir accidentally spilled while transporting. No ordinary life form can live in this pond.Yeon-woo leaned down and dipped his hand in the water.It did not feel like normal water at all. It was rather dense.Just to make sure, he threw in a small stone he found lying around his feet. The stone quickly crumbled apart and sank beneath the pond.\u2018Just as I thought.\u2019Yeon-woo drew his brows together.\u2018It\u2019s not ordinary water. It wasn\u2019t a lie to call it \u2018Heavyweight Water\u2019. Was it named after its heaviness?\u2019It was so high in density and pressure that it could not be compared to normal water.If an average person were to dive in, they would be crushed flat. Even if the body could withstand the pressure, their stamina wouldn\u2019t last long.They wouldn\u2019t even be able to rely on buoyancy to float on this water.\u2018If I try to swim across without knowing the pond\u2019s depth and width, I\u2019ll be dead soon. I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s inside.\u2019Yeon-woo concentrated on the line \u2018No ordinary life form can live in this pond\u2019 in the information window.In other words, extraordinary life forms could be living inside.Even if not, at the very least, there should be some sort of trap set up underneath the surface.Yeon-woo didn\u2019t jump the gun.Instead,\u2018It must be here somewhere.\u2019He carefully scanned the walls of the path leading to the pond.\u2018Draconic Eyes.\u2019Dozens of flaws were drawn along the walls.Yeon-woo found a spot where the flaws were all tangled up and pressed it with his hands.*Clank*In that moment, he noticed the wall sliding inwards.*Rumble*The wall stirred up a cloud of dust as it began to turn sideways. Then it stopped with a thunk, and a new staircase heading downwards emerged.\u2018There we go.\u2019A little smile flickered on Yeon-woo\u2019s face.It was the hidden piece buried in the Black Route, the fourth difficulty. It was the place where \u2018Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword\u2019 was hidden.[You have entered the dungeon.][You have found the hidden piece, \u2018Room of Frost and Flame\u2019.][You have acquired 300 Karma.]Yeon-woo ignored the pleasant sounds in his head and descended into the dungeon.The spiral staircase led to somewhere deep inside.Perhaps because it was a deep cave, from some point onwards the light was cut off and the staircase was no longer visible.However, Yeon-woo did not worry too much.[Sense Strengthening: 17.8%]Thanks to his high skill proficiency, which had once again increased by nearly 3% after clearing the boss room in Section A, it was now possible for him to recognize the surroundings through different senses without having to concentrate on his eyesight.No, it was possible to take in more information by doing this, rather than by relying on just his eyes.The surrounding sounds, the terrain\u2019s layout, his own movements\u2026Everything was felt as it was. There was no blind spot.What\u2019s more,Had it been just a few days ago, he would\u2019ve had to consciously concentrate on maintaining his skill active, but now he was so used to it that he could have it constantly active without having to pay much attention.It could be said that his active skill had turned into a passive skill. Thanks to this, Yeon-woo was able to move through the dungeon without any difficulties.Who knows how far down he had gone.Soon after, a piercing wind blew from inside,*Whistle*The stairs came to an end and a new cave appeared.\u2018Found it.\u2019The cave was full of a white colored moss along the walls.[White Moss]A type of moss that bears the essence of the moon. \u00a0It can cause illness if eaten. It doesn\u2019t taste good either.The explanation was as simple as it could be.But Yeon-woo was well aware of the hidden effect of the White Moss.It was only later that I discovered that as difficult as the Black Route was, it also had many different solutions. One of the solutions was White Moss.The White Moss was a substance full of moon essence. Many animals feed on this as their staple.However, it does not suit human constitution, so even if one eats it, the body cannot absorb the energy and often gets sick.So, players who somehow managed to find dungeons usually avoided White Moss.Therefore, players who chose the Black Route often turned back soon after finding this cave.Because there was no light, they couldn\u2019t even see their hand in front of their face, and the cave was worthlessly long and full of useless things. No one wanted to waste their time in a place like this when they were busy moving forward.Even Yeon-woo\u2019s brother didn\u2019t know about the secret this place held until very long after.However, I learned about it after hearing it from my close friend from the Yeon-dan family. That White Moss is a kind of material, and there is a unique way of consuming it.\u2018White Moss is too fragile. Because it\u2019s thin, it just melts when ingested. However,\u2019Yeon-woo stopped thinking and turned his eyes towards the sound coming from somewhere.KigigicGigicSomething stuck its head out through the White Moss out of a sudden. It was a centipede as big as person\u2019s forearm. Its reddish exoskeleton seemed pretty hard.[Red O-Gong]A centipede that feeds on White Moss. Because it dwells in aquatic caverns, its eyes have atrophied and has developed other senses. Sometimes it prefers meat over moss.Khaak!As if thinking the intruder was after its food, the centipede moved its dozens of legs and approached Yeon-woo at a furious speed.It crawled down from the ceiling along the wall.It was a scene that would make any ordinary person feel both surprised and disgusted.Yeon-woo, however, stepped forward.\u2018Insects and beasts that eat White Moss as their staple have evolved to artificially radiate heat in order to absorb the moon essence. And that kind of heat emanates from their heart which contains the fire(\u706b) property.\u2019He felt the touch of the dagger with his fingertips.\u2018On the other hand, White Moss\u2019 property is water(\u6c34). If you consume both heart and moss at the same time, the two properties will synergize with each other and become an elixir that hardens the bones and muscles.\u2019Numerous elixirs exist in The Tower. Some can augment magic power, and some affect certain stats or properties. Among them, Yeon-woo went for the elixir that would help him nourish his bones and muscles.The human body is too weak. It easily falls ill, breaks, and tears. But the combination of White Moss and the heart of a fire property beast can transmute such body. It could make bones much stronger, muscles much sturdier. It could transform one\u2019s body into one more suitable for combat.*Pat*Yeonwoo bolted forward, throwing the dagger he held in his hand. The dagger penetrated the hard armor of the Red O-Kong, splashing blood and body fluids.Kiek!The centipede expressed anger and twisted its body as it spread its forcipules.*Rumble*The ground under the centipede caved in as it crawled over it.[Flame Monster has appeared][Hidden Quest / Frost and Flame]Content: The Room of Frost and Flame is filled with unique monsters that feed on White Moss. If they come out of the dungeon, the outer ecosystem could be thrown into chaos. Hunt down as many monsters as you can.Reward: Rewards will be given according to the number of monsters hunted.\u2013 100 or more: 100 Karma\u2013 300 or more: 300 Karma\u2013 500 or more: 500 Karma + Additional rewards according to achievement\u2013 Over 1,000: ??\u2018It\u2019s up.\u2019The Room of Frost and Flame had one more advantage besides the benefit of obtaining Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword and toughening up the body.According to the number of monsters hunted, additional Karma could be obtained, and there were also additional rewards if the number exceeded 500.The more he hunted, the stronger his body would become, and he would also horde Karma and rewards. It was basically a treasure trove.\u2018No matter how, I have to win the reward for hunting a thousand monsters.\u2019*Pat*Yeon-woo chose not to engage head-on. Instead, he quickly shifted his body sideways and narrowly avoided the attack.*Kwang*In the spot where the Red O-Gong rammed its head, some rocks were being crushed by its forcipules.\u2018The monsters here are very strong. Even with this stronger body I honed in Section A, they\u2019re not easy to kill. It will be really dangerous if I let them crush from the front.\u2019As soon as Yeon-woo finished measuring up the Red O-Gong, he aimed for its trunk.However,*Tang*\u2018Yup, it\u2019s hard. Too hard.\u2019The dagger bounced off of it\u2019s surface, leaving behind only a scratch. But even that was enough to aggravate Red O-Gong, so it squirmed its body to catch Yeon-woo with its forcipules.Once again, Yeon-woo narrowly avoided its attack and continued racking his brain.A cloud of dust rose up as a deep pit had been created in the place where he had been standing.\u2018Normal attacks won\u2019t do any harm to it. The exoskeleton is too sturdy. The dagger I just threw pierced its skin by luck but\u2026 it\u2019s too shallow. It\u2019s not enough to weaken it.\u2019However, he could not let this battle turn into a war of attrition.He didn\u2019t know how much health the Red O-Gong had, and this was still just the entrance of the dungeon.Due to not knowing how deep the dungeon was, he had to end the battle as quickly as possible.*Kwang*Once again, the Red O-Gong rammed its head towards the spot where Yeon-woo was standing.Kieeec!If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Black Route (2)Maybe because it was annoyed by Yeon-woo repeatedly going back and forth while dodging, the Red O-Gong let out a sharp cry.*Ta-dak*\u2018Weak point. Where is its weak point?\u2019Yeon-woo got on the Red O-Kong\u2019s nerves as he kept circling around it.Thanks to the Dexterity and Health stats he had accumulated in section A, he didn\u2019t have to worry about being slowed down or getting exhausted anymore.Occasionally, he would also catch the Red O-Gong off guard.There were some places where its flesh was exposed. Right where a segment of its shell connected with another.Yeon-woo stabbed and sliced its joints, and then jumped back out.Kyaaa!As he repeated this procedure, the floor gradually filled with the Red O-Gong\u2019s blood and body fluids. However, the Red O-Gong didn\u2019t get exhausted. On the contrary, it was becoming more furious and more ferocious.\u2018There is a tremendous disparity between clearing traps and slaying monsters. I just have to figure out the correct strategy.\u2019Unlike traps that only needed to be avoided, monsters needed to be hunted.He had to deal with a predator that was trying to eat him.Seen from a distance, it was not much different from his experience in Africa.\u2018After all, a life is just a life, and that applies to monsters too. There should be some kind of weakness\u2026 Wait, weakness?\u2019Then an idea flashed across Yeon-woo\u2019s head.\u2018Draconic Eyes!\u2019As the black pupils in his eyes sank and expanded, his now black-and-white vision was focused on the Red O-Gong.Everything he saw was now composed of only black lines, just like a drawing sketch, only the monster\u2019s contour was shown. However, a few fine lines of flaws could be seen mixed among the black ones.Then, with his eyes, he tracked the point where the flaws converged.\u2018There it is.\u2019It was a spot in the the exoskeleton right between its head and neck. If it were a human, that would be its cervical spine.Why did he never think of using his Draconic Eyes on living creatures? That was most likely because he had always been using it on inanimate objects, so he had thought that there was a limit to it.But now that he realized it, things weren\u2019t as bad as they appeared to be. So he continued examining Red O-Gong\u2019s movements with his Draconic Eyes.Of course, finding its weakness did not instantly turn his situation into an easy hunt. It still didn\u2019t take away the speed, fierceness and strength of the Red O-Gong.Most importantly, unlike inanimate objects, the Red O-Gong\u2019s weak point was in constant, fast paced movement.Pinpointing that small spot and accurately stabbing it wasn\u2019t an easy task. The short duration of Draconic Eyes also added to the problem.*Kwang*Yeon-woo strengthened all of his senses as he tried to keep distance from where the dust produced by the debris was rising.He wanted to examine the movements of the Red O-Gong in more detail.Kikikick.The Red O-Gong did a big turn and rushed down the concave wall.Yeon-woo ran to its left side, aiming for the moment the Red O-Gong would raise its mouth and roar.\u2018Now!\u2019*Pat*Yeon-woo\u2019s feet kicked the ground as he darted out.The Red O-Gong clattered its forcipules as it thought the food that had been getting on its nerves had finally gone mad. Its dozens of feet moved, charging towards Yeon-Woo like a rhynol.As soon as Yeon-woo avoided its head, he slapped its shell with his left hand, propelling himself high into the air and climbed onto its neck.He held the dagger backwards, and then stabbed it into its weak spot.*Puck*[\u2018Draconic Eyes\u2019 skill proficiency has increased. 2.4%][You have learned to strike into the opponent\u2019s flaws.]*Spurt*Blood poured out like a fountain. That spot had probably contained an artery. The amount of blood that was gushing out could not be compared to what had been spilled so far.However, the dagger was stuck midway through and did not go any deeper.Just before reaching its weak point, it bumped into something hard and wouldn\u2019t pierce further.\u2018An inner shell?\u2019Yeon-woo\u2019s face turned stern. He didn\u2019t know there was still another shell protecting its weakness beneath the outer shell. His Draconic Eyes didn\u2019t catch such detail.Sensing the danger, Yeon-woo tried to get away from the Red O-Gong.*Swish*Before he knew it, the tail of the Red O-Gong was flying towards him like a whip.*Puck*Yeon-woo crossed his arms to protect his upper body as much as possible. With a crushing impact, his body bounced backwards and crashed hard into the wall.\u201cKuck!\u201dYeon-woo spat out a mouthful of blood. His body felt like it was going to shatter into pieces. He couldn\u2019t think straight because of dizziness.[Horrendous pain overcomes your body. You have been afflicted with \u2018Stun\u2019.][You have severe internal injuries. You have been afflicted with \u2018Shock\u2019.][Red O-Gong\u2019s body fluid has seeped into your body. You have been afflicted with \u2018Poison\u2019.]Yeon-woo, however, gritted his teeth and quickly checked on his physical condition using his strengthened senses.\u2018Four broken ribs, two fractures in the spine. Vein in left thigh is ruptured. Achilles tendon in right ankle is torn.\u2019There was no doubt that he shouldn\u2019t be able to move an inch due to the seriousness of his injuries.The Red O-Gong took the opportunity to charge towards him with the speed of an arrow. Its forcipules were right in front of his face.But even in such crisis, Yeon-woo managed to assess the best course of action based on his current situation.In that brief moment,[Your trait \u2018Cold-blooded\u2019 has helped you maintain composure.][The status effect \u2018Stun\u2019 has been removed. You have developed resistance to pain.][The status effect \u2018Shock\u2019 has been removed. You have developed resistance to impact.][The status effect \u2018Poison\u2019 has been removed. You have developed resistance to poison.]\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7[The skill \u2018Physical Resistance\u2019 has been created.][You have shown great presence of mind in any given situation. You have attained deep enlightenment in regards to perseverance and an indomitable will.][The skill \u2018Combat Will\u2019 has been created.]Messages notified him that two new skills had been created. But Yeon-woo couldn\u2019t afford to check his new skills. Still, he could tell what the skills were about by just looking at their names.In that instant, the terrible pain greatly subsided. Furthermore, his consciousness also became clearer and he was now more capable of thinking and making decisions.He felt as if time had slowed down for a brief moment.Thought acceleration (\u601d\u8003\u52a0\u901f).Thanks to this, Yeon-woo was able to assess a number of actions he could take before the Red O-Gong reached him.And he finally chose one of them.At that moment.Kieek!The forcipules were closing in right in front of his face.Yeon-woo pointed his dagger towards the front.*Kwang*\u201cHup!\u201dYeon-woo was lifted up by the impact. His upper body dug deeper into the wall. His spine suffered yet another fracture and both of his arm were shaking from the pain.Still, he forced himself to tighten his grip on the dagger. Blood drizzled down from his torn hands, but he clenched his teeth. Both his eyes were already red from being bloodshot.Kakakac!The Red O-Gong\u2019s forcipules were being blocked by the dagger, as they kept opening and closing in front of Yeon-woo\u2019s face.Behind its forcipules, he could see deep into its throat, which was covered with countless fangs.The Red O-Gong writhed to bite off Yeon-woo\u2019s head. Whenever its forcipules clattered, his dagger trembled as if it would break any time soon.In the end, Yeon-woo couldn\u2019t hold any longer, and the Red O-Gong\u2019s forcipules almost reached his face.*Tssss*A rock melted as the monster\u2019s saliva touched the ground.At that moment, Yeon-woo\u2019s body slid downwards.Once again, the Red O-Gong rammed its head into the wall. In the meantime, Yeon-woo was able to reach beneath it. Other than its joints, this was the only part that wasn\u2019t covered by the hard shell.\u2018This is its belly.\u2019There was the smooth abdomen of the Red O-Gong right before his eyes.He stabbed it with the tip of the now badly chipped dagger.*Puck*Kieeek!The monster raised its head and screamed in terrible pain.Nevertheless, Yeon-woo tenaciously held onto the dagger stuck deep in its stomach.The centipede twisted its body around and went on a rampage, trying to shake him off. But contrary to its wish, Yeon-woo shoved the dagger even deeper into its stomach.*Crunch*While dangling from the monster\u2019s abdomen, Yeon-woo clenched his teeth and squeezed his arm right into it. The tip of the dagger had almost reached the point where the flaws converged.*Snap*He heard something breaking from the inside. He didn\u2019t know what exactly it was, but he was sure it was critical to this centipede.\u201cI won.\u201dYeon-woo smiled coldly and sliced its belly downwards.*Shlckt**Spurt*There was a long cut along the monster\u2019s stomach. Its entrails poured out, and blood splattered everywhere. The whole cave was being painted with blood.Kieek!Red O-Gong was struggling with pain. Then as its strength started to drain out, the centipede\u2019s head finally fell onto a puddle of its own blood and let out a wheeze.*Flop*Yeon-woo also fell to the floor.His body was already a total wreck. He was so worn out that he couldn\u2019t even lift a finger.The Red O-Gong glared at Yeon-woo, its eyes filled with resentment.After a lifetime inside this cave, its eyes had already degenerated. But at the end they were still looking at him.And soon it stopped breathing.\u2018This is ridiculous.\u2019Yeon-woo breathed heavily and frowned.He thought he gained some strength from his time spent in Section A and dealing with a few players. But this stupid tutorial didn\u2019t give him any chance to relax. It wasn\u2019t lying when it said high difficulty.However, he still concluded that his training so far didn\u2019t let him down. If he hadn\u2019t done that, it\u2019d be him lying dead on the floor right now, not the Red O-Gong.He already knew what to do after the battle.With all the strength he could muster, Yeon-woo forced himself to move.He had also spilled too much blood. For now, he was somehow maintaining his consciousness by relying on his skills, but he could pass out at any moment, like a candle in the wind.He had to get everything done before that happened.His body moved like a marionette without strings, but he managed to crawl along.He tore some White Moss from the floor and crudely pushed it into his mouth. He had no strength to chew, but fortunately the moss melted like water and flowed down his throat.*Swoosh*He felt something cold slipping inside his body.Before the feeling disappeared, Yeon-woo grabbed onto the hard shell of the Red O-Gong, raised his upper body and pushed his face into the open wound.It was filled with a disgusting, rotten stench, but at the end he managed to find what he was looking for.The centipede\u2019s heart was still beating.With his mouth wide open,*Chomp*He bit into the heart.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Black Route (3)*Gulp*Blood was continuously gushing out. Most of it was coming out from his mouth, but Yeon-woo tried his best to swallow it back.His throat was burning with toxicity and the foul stench made him gag. Despite his disgust, Yeon-woo continued to drink the blood as he chewed on the heart that was much tougher than leather.At that moment.*Woosh*The energy that the White Moss contained was wriggling inside his body. It was the Pure Essence(\u7cbe\u6c23) formed by the energy of the moon. This would act as a catalyst to filter out the heat and dregs and to blend the energies together.*Crunch* *Crackle*Yeon-woo\u2019s body began to change little by little.The broken bones knitted together. The torn muscles closed up. The patches of peeled skin were replaced with new skin. But it didn\u2019t end there. His bones became much denser, his muscles tougher and his skin smoother. His physique was improving little by little.[The Red O-Gong has been successfully slain. You have killed an enemy that would normally be impossible for you. Additional Karma will be provided.][You have acquired 100 Karma.][Your Strength has increased by 7 points.][Your Dexterity has increased by 6 points.][Your Health has increased by 5 points.][Your body is experiencing slow changes][\u2018Physical Resistance\u2019 skill proficiency has increased significantly. 7.2%][The heart of Red O-Gong has been ingested.

He was covered in blood, but he didn\u2019t look tired anymore.\u201cHoo.\u201dYeon-woo sat back against the wall and gathered his breath. His injuries were all healed up, but he was still mentally fatigued.\u201cWell, I made it somehow.\u201dThe feeling of a strange energy transforming his body little by little, even if it wasn\u2019t his first time, it still felt foreign to him.The feeling of freshness that came after the change made him think it was ironic.Yeon-woo briefly looked at the Red O-Gong and spat out a piece of heart that was still left in his mouth.\u2018The dungeon is full of monsters like this. What a dreadful place.\u2019Even if he was shaking his head in disbelief, his vision packed with messages made him feel better.\u2018I managed to obtain \u2019Flame Heart and Frost Crest\u2019.\u2019It was the effect caused by the simultaneous consumption of White Moss and the heart of a fire property beast. It was a hidden piece that strengthened one\u2019s skeleton and muscles.The progress was only at 1.5%, but he was already starting to feel reinvigorated.\u201cI heard that the stronger the body becomes, the faster it\u2019ll recover from fatigue. Well, that\u2019s a relief.\u201dYeon-woo summoned the status window to check his improved body.[Player: Yeon-woo Cha]Trait: Cold-bloodedStrength: 60 \u00a0\u00a0Dexterity: 65 \u00a0 Health: 62 \u00a0\u00a0Magic Power: 21Skills: Draconic Eyes(3.1%), Sense Strengthening(17.8%), Foresight(0.0%), Physical Resistance(7.2%), Combat Will(3.2%)\u2018I didn\u2019t expect I\u2019d gain more stats from killing Red O-Gong than from beating the boss room.\u2019Yeon-woo was stupefied by this thought and let out a hollow laughter.However, it was obvious that players would be given more stats according to the level of adversity they overcame, and the Black Route was remarkably dangerous.But one thing was certain, his body was going through a steady change. Most of the stats were already over 60.\u2018My low Magic Power is the only flaw, but what can I do about it?\u2019Yeon-woo frowned while looking at his Magic Power which was his highest attribute at first, but was now the lowest.There was no way for him to put his Magic Power to use for now, so he had no choice but to sit on his hands.Still, he couldn\u2019t help but worry about the continuously increasing gap between Magic Power and his other attribute points.\u2018I need to think of a way to feel mana as soon as possible.\u2019Thanks to Yul, he already had a firm understanding of the concept of mana. Therefore, the only thing he had to do now was to come up with a way to feel it.\u2018The problem is how.\u2019In reality, unlike his younger brother who could be categorized as a natural genius, Yeon-woo\u2019s achievements all came from being a hard worker. It had been like that since they were kids.Yeon-woo was different from his younger brother who did everything effortlessly. He often had to try over and over again to solve a problem, but he tried not to show the efforts he made, pretending he was doing fine.Even when he was dispatched to Africa, initially he was so weak that he often caused his unit to receive collective punishment, but later on he managed to become part of the special task force.Yeon-woo was used to pushing himself to the limit. He would slam himself against the walls of limitation again and again until it would finally break down. And when he encountered another wall, he would continue to hit it until it broke once again.Things weren\u2019t much different this time. Yeon-woo was well aware of the fact that he was the one furthest behind among the many players participating in the tutorial. That was why he only walked the hardest path, and that was how he achieved his outstanding growth.Since he wasn\u2019t talented, he had to find ways that best fit him based on his own judgement. \u00a0Mana seemed to require the same approach.He knew he had to keep trying to find a clue to handling mana. The problem was that there was no way to get to the clue.At this rate, his Magic Power would most likely end up being a big dud in his status window.But he couldn\u2019t let that happen.\u2018I can count on my skills for now, but there\u2019s going to be a lot of situations where mana will come in handy. That\u2019s bound to happen as long as I keep climbing higher.\u2019Mana allowed its users to do things that were physically impossible. It was the power that made so-called magic or unique skills possible.The Tower was a place full of supernaturalities, so he couldn\u2019t just give up such power.Above all, Yeon-woo had not yet completed his awakening.Mana was essential to fully accept this power which originated from the Ancient Dragon Kalatus.The dragon race was a noble species that was known as the founder of all mana and magic.\u2018Let\u2019s wait for a while and see. Just worrying about it won\u2019t solve the problem.\u2019For now, he had to focus on what he could do and solve the mana problem later. And if no matter how hard he tried he still couldn\u2019t find the answer, he could also resort to other unconventional methods.\u201cThey say there are plenty of players who are really good with magic. If there\u2019s really no way, then I should abduct one of them and figure out how.\u2019Harming a person who had little to do with his matters was not the way he sought. But he also couldn\u2019t keep waiting without doing anything.Yeon-woo left the idea of mana and Magic Power behind, and this time he looked at his two newly acquired skills.[Physical Resistance]Rating: E-Proficiency: 7.2%When active, resistance to physical attacks increases. In some cases, high resistance to a variety of status effects will be invoked.[Combat Will]Rating: D+Proficiency: 3.2%Through perseverance and an indomitable will, you burn with fighting spirit no matter the circumstances. While focusing on combat, thought acceleration allows quick decision making.\u2018Rating?\u2019When Yeon-woo first saw the newly added information, he made a surprised expression and slowly nodded.As his abilities got stronger, he was now able to find things he originally couldn\u2019t.The rating reflected the value of a skill. A highly rated skill meant it was powerful, and required less mana or mental power consumption.The ways to improve the rating of a skill were simple. One way was to gain enlightenment, apply it to the usage of a skill and gain the interface system\u2019s recognition. The other way was to raise its proficiency.The ratings his two skills had were not so bad.No, Combat Will skill was actually great.\u2018It\u2019s really hard to get skills above D rating in the tutorial.\u2019Yeon-woo contently smiled and organized the information about the two skills.\u2018Physical Resistance will be effective against external impact. It will minimize the impact from an attack and will also relieve pain.\u2019It was a must-have skill for Yeon-woo, who was heavily dependent on melee combat.He had to endure terrible pain many times throughout his training.He managed to maintain consciousness thanks to his cold-blooded trait, but if a person were to be continuously exposed to pain, it could have a devastating effect on their mental health.However, if he could use this skill properly, he could avoid such situations.\u2018I like its high resistance to status effects too.\u2019Poison, burn, frostbite, panic(stun), hallucination and curse were the biggest obstacles during raids. But if he could avoid all that, it would pose a big advantage.Yeon-woo felt drawn to his Physical Resistance skill in many ways.It wasn\u2019t an extravagant skill, but it would be of great support to his combat style.But the skill that appealed the most to Yeon-woo\u2019s taste was Combat Will.\u2018Thought acceleration, this is the most important one.\u2019In tense situations, quick judgment was a double-edged sword. It could be an important key to survival, but could also be the worst card that might cause self-annihilation. So judgment had to be made with caution, and the thought process was bound to be complicated.But this was a skill that made both quick judgement and deep thought possible at the same time. He had even experienced it for himself when he was killing the Red O-Gong.The moment he felt time slowing down, when the Red O-Gong\u2019s mouth was about to reach his head, his quick judgement that resulted from thought acceleration had led Yeon-woo to victory.\u2018It\u2019s really a big merit to be able to make a calm judgement. Besides, this skill can be used in other ways too.\u2019The benefits of Combat Will did not end there.Because it enabled extreme concentration, the skill also had a great effect on Sense Strengthening and on Draconic Eyes.He should be able to control his senses more meticulously, so it should be easier to detect things that he hadn\u2019t been able to detect before.Using this as an opportunity, Yeon-woo closed his eyes thinking of casting Combat Will once more.Sense Strengthening was already in action. Currently, Yeon-woo could scan areas up to 15 meters ahead.But the moment he cast Combat Will,-^#$$#$%^$#!##*!!!\u201c\u2026!\u201dYeon-woo almost screamed due to the pressure of the enormous amount of information coming into his head.Then it was accompanied with a sudden nausea and an urge to vomit.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dWith extreme patience, Yeon-woo was able to stop himself from throwing up, but his mind was zoning out.The effect was more potent than what he had imagined. He could see, hear, smell, feel and taste way too many things.There should have been some sort of limit. But as if the limiter had been disabled, so much information poured down on him that he couldn\u2019t quite figure out what was what.Lights were stirring in his vision, sounds were buzzing in his ears, and smells were pricking his nose. He felt like the information was igniting his brain on fire, so he quickly turned it off.He highly doubted he would be able to filter out all the useless information from the enormous amount that flowed in.\u2018Nothing ever goes my way.\u2019Yeon-woo wrinkled his brows and wiped the sweat flowing down his chin with his hands.However, he couldn\u2019t just quit here.Although it just for a fleeting moment, Yeon-woo had clearly felt a sensation similar to as if his body was floating through the combined use of the two skills. And in the process, he was able to feel so many things.There was no reason to refuse when he had found a way to grow.\u2018Let\u2019s do this.\u2019He once again closed his eyes and cast Combat Will and Sense Strengthening at the same time. The burning pain in his brain made him frown.Yeon-woo went down the passage of the dungeon, somehow enduring the throbbing headache by turning on Physical Resistance at the same time.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Black Route (4)\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201dBild stood scowling at the sight of Kaen\u2019s party.It happened while he was on a mission to pick an important item. So now he was extremely irked.He thought he had found some good prospects for his clan. But everything had turned into nothing. It was already too late to get their injuries treated.Apparently, they were able to stay alive thanks to some generous players who had been sharing their food with them.Among the four, the person who was faring relatively better had his entire lower body paralyzed, and in Kaen\u2019s case, his body was completely paralyzed from neck down.Bild asked Kaen\u2019s party what had happened to them. But none of the four could give a proper answer, they just vacantly gazed into space. Some of them gave out dejected laughter as if they had lost their minds.Bild realized that it was meaningless to keep trying to get information from Kaen\u2019s party, so instead he started looking for witnesses.It was a conflict between players, so he could just ignore it and let it go.\u2018But you dare to mess up with us, don\u2019t you? So annoying! He must have known they were under Arangdan\u2019s protection, but he just didn\u2019t care\u2026 That means he\u2019s looking down on us.\u2019Bild was very proud of Arangdan. To be exact, His loyalty was directed towards Cheonghwado, which encompasses Arangdan.Still, Arangdan was a product of his hard work. He had established it along with the man he served. He couldn\u2019t stand the thought of it to being looked down upon.\u201cIt was a guy wearing a white mask?\u201dEvery single witness had said the same thing. White mask, short dagger, fast movements.\u201cHuh? Ye- yes, it was.\u201d\u201cA mask, was it?\u201dBild raised his eyebrows.A man with a white mask on, he had never heard of someone with such a weird appearance in this tutorial round.\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to start searching first.\u201dBild then proceeded to run off to somewhere.*Shick*He didn\u2019t have to worry about traveling between each section.Players who had cleared the tutorial were given a pass ticket to go anywhere within the tutorial.\u2018Too bad I can\u2019t gain any additional stats or Karma here.\u2019Because of his haste, Bild had overlooked something.Just before the fight with the masked man, there had been a young man who had had a conversation with Kaen\u2019s party.* \u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0 *Kikikic! Kikic!Taking advantage of the darkness, three bats launched their attacks.Every time they opened their mouth and shot out ultrasonic waves, the whole cave reverberated, confusing his senses.*Kwang* *Kwang*Amid such turmoil, Yeon-woo accurately detected the position of each bat by solely listening to the sound of the wind, and flung three daggers in each direction.Along with the sound of heads shattering and wings ripping, the bats fell down onto the floor. Then, he threw himself between the bats and finished them off.[You have successfully slain 5 Sonic Bats][Number of monsters hunted: 147]\u201cHoo. I\u2019m starting to get used to it.\u201dYeon-woo gently warmed up his shoulders and approached the bats\u2019 carcasses.After entering the dungeon and getting rid of the Red O-Gong, Yeon-woo kept descending through it and killed any monster he encountered.The monsters that appeared here closely resembled insects and beasts that were commonly seen in aquatic caverns. Things like centipedes, salamanders, hogfish, crickets and bats. They looked just the same but bigger. They looked disgusting.Moreover, just like the Red O-Gong was hard to defeat, other monsters were quite difficult to deal with as well.However, as the number of monster he hunted increased, he was getting more and more used to it, and after the number reached 100, hunting had gotten much easier.Once he familiarized himself with their unique patterns, it became a piece of cake.\u201cThe effect of Flame Heart and Frost Crest also played its role.\u201dYeon-woo drew a dagger hanging on the edge of his waist and began dissecting the carcass of one of the bats. He peeled off its skin, separated the bones from the flesh, and slowly pulled out the intestines. It was something he had done in Africa several times.Thanks to his former experiences, Yeon-woo was able to extract whatever he needed without much difficulty.\u2018He said the eyeballs and vocal cords of the Sonic Bats will become valuable later on, right?\u2019These items could all be used as materials.His brother had specified a number of items in his diary, saying that they were hard to find in The Tower so he had to get them while he was in the tutorial.\u2018If I can make a good artifact out of these little things, I will profit greatly.\u2019Yeon-woo only extracted the parts that could be used as materials and organized them in his backpack, then began to carefully remove the hearts.He had been so worn out when he killed the Red O-Gong that he had no choice but to bite its heart off with his teeth. But to properly absorb the essence of flame monsters required considerable skill.He gouged the hearts out of the bats with a clean cut.Yeon-woo tore off a handful of White Moss and pushed it into his mouth, then ate the hearts one by one.*Crack*He could hear the sound produced by the changes occurring inside his body. At the same time, his body felt refreshed, and he once again felt something flowing rapidly through an unknown path inside of him.The flow was something he would have never been able to feel if he hadn\u2019t increased his concentration using Combat Will.It was a familiar flow and a familiar feeling.\u2018Magic Power.\u2019Bodily waste excreted out from his pores.[You have obtained a piece of \u2018Flame Heart and Frost Crest\u2019][Current progress: 16.2%]As soon as the message popped up, the mana that had been drifting inside his body disappeared as if it had never existed.Yeon-woo only licked his lips.As the progress of Flame Heart and Frost Crest increased, the feeling of mana flowing inside his body was becoming more clear.Yeon-woo realized that mana was also involved in the changes of his body, so he tried finding clues from it.However, as usual, mana only gave him a little taste and disappeared as if it was toying with him.\u2018There\u2019s nothing I can do.\u2019But that didn\u2019t mean there was no payoff at all.As Flame Heart and Frost Crest progressed, the amount of mana in his body was growing little by little, and he could sense mana more and more clearly.Yeon-woo could only guess that he should be able to handle the mana when the progress reached 100%, so there was no need to be in a hurry.\u2018What\u2019s urgent is this right here\u2019From what was left of the bat\u2019s carcass, Yeon-woo chose only hard parts such as the teeth, claws and bones.Then he applied a mixture of White Moss and the Red O-Gong\u2019s toxic blood on them.*Tsss*Then the parts that were covered in the mixture began to melt while producing smoke.Each monster has a different kind of toxin in its blood. Some are even deadly, so they have to be dealt with caution in order to prevent contact with the blood .One of my teammates had a little, no, a veeery weird taste. He used this kind of toxin for battle purposes. He didn\u2019t want to battle monsters face-to-face because he was too lazy, or that\u2019s what he said.But if you were to ask me, I would say that that laziness gave birth to a monster.Arthia was a clan that had once ranked sixth in The Tower.If they were to determine who was the best player in their clan, his brother and also another player would come to mind.No, even his brother had to admit that that person was a notch above himself when fighting against a large force.Bayluk, the anti-venom.Ignoring the fact that he was one of the enemies who deserved a slow, miserable death , Yeon-woo could still learn a thing or two from him.\u201cBayluk used to be a scholar who originally studied alchemy in his world. Based on this, he made a great achievement by analyzing the toxins that were found in monsters\u2019 blood.\u2019In view of this, his brother had picked up some of Bayluk\u2019s studies behind his back, and that had all been passed down to Yeon-woo.The concoction Yeon-woo had applied to the parts of the Sonic Bats was also one of Bayluk\u2019s products.[Liquefying Acid Solution (\u6eb6\u9178\u6eb6\u6db2)]A solution that weakens the structure of hard materials. If the solution is high in concentration, it will dissolve the material.\u2018There\u2019s no reason to be ashamed of stealing his research If it is stealable and can be used effectively.\u2019Even if he was an enemy, if Yeon-woo could borrow something from him, he should do his best.No, he was almost too happy from stealing the information, since Bayluk was his enemy.As the claws and teeth softened up, Yeon-woo began to crush them into fine dust using the pommel of his dagger. It didn\u2019t require much effort since his Strength stat was already approaching 70.Next, he gathered up the powder and wrapped it up inside the bat wings that he had cut into squares beforehand. Then he tied them together using the tendons.They were now fist-sized pouches full of powder.From the entrance of the dungeon up until now, he had collected large amounts of powder through this method. And this one was his fifteenth pouch.On the surface, it could be seen as a meaningless task, however it was crucial in order to pass through the next point.\u2018There it is, the ant tunnel. He said this is the most troublesome part.\u2019Yeon-woo looked at the cave beyond the passage, and frowned a little.Monsters that appeared in Room of Frost and Flame varied depending on the area and environment. The same applied to this cave. There was only one kind of monster that dwelled in this place.The cave in front of Yeon-woo was incomparably larger than the passage he had come through.His eyes caught sight of a countless amount of white eggs laid along the walls and ceiling.It was a colony of Blue Army Ants.[Blue Army Ant]The size of an ant ranges from 30 centimeters to 1 meter. Hundreds of ants form a society around the ant queen.Due to the nature of ant societies, every ant, including worker ants, are willing to sacrifice their lives defending their habitat if it comes under attack.Engaging in battle with all of them at once?The reason why he had been able to hunt more than 100 monsters was because the monsters only appeared one or two at a time, five at most.If he fought hundreds of them at the same time,\u2018That\u2019s just nuts.\u2019Before he could take any action, he would be torn into pieces and end up being fed to baby ants.The problem was that Yeon-woo had to pass through this cave.\u2018In the room beyond this cave, lays Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword.\u2019Artifact number 352.It was a number symbolizing Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword.When I found out that that place contained the hidden remains of Erzsebet Bathory, Lord of Vampires, I genuinely freaked out.In The Tower, there are dozens of classes a player can choose from in order to ensure smooth growth. And those who show outstanding qualities are given the title of \u2018Lord\u2019.Each and every one of them is a master in their domain as well as an absolute being with hundreds and thousands of followers.The Lord of Vampires was one of the Lords who perished a long time ago.Legend has it, that she was a bringer of death and destruction. She could drain the vitality out of others to strengthen herself, and if allowed to continue, she could also rob them of their skills.He had heard that there were still quite a few players and clans who would grind their teeth in frustration whenever they recalled the damage they had suffered from her.Its artifact number was very low, as it was the legacy left by such a powerful being.\u2018The smaller the number, the better. Artifacts with a three digit number, in the 300\u2019s are among the best. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s a Unique Item. It\u2019s one of a kind in the whole Tower and tutorial. I cannot miss this.\u2019But hundreds of Blue Army Ants were camping outside the entrance.\u2018Even if the path looks like its blocked, there\u2019s always a way around.\u2019Yeon-woo tied the tendons of the pouches into a single knot and slung them over his shoulder. The knot was made so that if he pulled the other side of the string, it would be undone right away.\u201cHoo!\u201dYeon-woo gently took a breath and,*Pat*He quickly ran towards the entrance of the ant tunnel.Kiric?Keeec!One by one, the ants noticed his presence and turned their heads towards Yeon-woo.The one guarding the entrance let out a horrible shriek, showing its big mandibles.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, but you need to get out of the way.\u201dWith an agile movement, Yeon-woo grabbed the pouches on his shoulder and threw them in between the guard ants and into the tunnel.His throw was quite accurate since he had practiced his throwing skills whenever he was bored in Africa.Then he tugged at the string. The pouches opened up one after another in midair.the powder was scattered over the cave, covering it like a thick red fog.The ants shrieked at his actions.*Click*To finish it off, Yeon-woo lit up the zippo that he had originally crammed inside his backpack and threw it towards the powder mist. At the same time, he quickly crouched down against the wall against next to the entrance.And then,*Kwang*Kieeek!A destructive explosion swept through the whole cave.A huge storm of flame tore off the walls.The Blue Army Ants were set ablaze, and screamed out loud as they burst into bits.The powder that caused the explosion wasn\u2019t just a normal powder. It was a powder made of monsters with fire property. Moreover, It was scattered all over a closed space and was set on fire with a lighter.The power of the explosion was incomparable to any dust explosion produced by a phenomenon.The explosion nearly shook the cavity upside down.*Rumble*[You have successfully blown up the ant tunnel. 217 of the Blue Army Ants were blasted, 89 of the Blue Army Ants were burned, and 92 of the Blue Army Ants were suffocated.][Additional Karma will be provided.][You have acquired 300 Karma.]If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Black Route (5)[Number of monsters hunted: 543]The dungeon was shaking up and down. Stone dust fell from the ceiling.Surprised by the sudden earthquake, monsters broke out of their areas causing a disturbance.Taking advantage of the confusion, Yeon-woo rushed into the tunnel while holding his dagger in a reverse grip.The scorching heat and the burning flames left no safe spot for him to tread on, but Yeon-woo held his breath and focused every single one of his senses on the ant tunnel.[Combat Will][Sense Strengthening]*Whoosh*As soon as he activated his skills, time around Yeon-woo seemed to stretch out.As his senses reached their peak potency and with the help of his heightened concentration, all the information about his surroundings poured into his brain.Although a terrible headache followed, he could withstand the pain thanks to his occasional practice.\u2018I can only last five minutes in this state!\u2019*Thwish*Yeon-woo rushed in between the ants that were struggling in pain and put them out of their misery.Even those that ran towards him while letting out a screech had their shells burned. It wasn\u2019t hard to get rid of them.\u2018It\u2019s a shame I can\u2019t eat all the hearts that are lying here.\u2019Still, he got to kill a large number of monsters at once, so it wasn\u2019t too much of a loss.The ants that were still alive or died of suffocation still had their hearts intact, so he could enjoy them later. Even so, he didn\u2019t think of eating them right away.Even if the explosion swept through the tunnel, nearly half of the ants had survived the impact. Most of those that died were mere antlings or eggs that had yet to hatch. Therefore, there were still many worker ants left alive.\u2018It won\u2019t be too late to clean this up after I get Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword. Right now I have to focus on\u2026.\u2019Kieeek!An ant that was approximately five times bigger than the average Blue Army Ant ran towards Yeon-woo.\u201cThe Ant Queen!\u201dThe Ant Queen expressed her fury towards the criminal who destroyed her den.[A boss monster, Blue Army Ant Queen has emerged.]If she were in optimal condition, Yeon-woo would have no chance of winning.The Ant Queen currently had two of her six legs blown away, her wings were completely torn apart, and her burned exoskeleton was festering. Her one remaining eye was blazing with anger.*Kung* *Kung*The ground shook with every step she took. The pressure he was feeling was greater than the one he felt when he faced the Red O-Gong.\u2018Four minutes.\u2019Yeon-woo quickly searched for the gate. But it wasn\u2019t easy to find because the tunnel was too wide.The Ant Queen swung its leg towards him as he searched. Yeon-woo swiftly rolled on the ground and narrowly dodged the attack.In the meantime, he continued searching for the gate.\u2018Three minutes.\u2019Time was ticking.Yeon-woo\u2019s senses finally caught on to something. A small gate was hidden beyond the fried ant eggs.\u2018That must be it!\u2019However, even if he found its location, the Ant Queen didn\u2019t seem to have any intention of letting him pass.\u2018Two minutes.\u2019The use of thought acceleration through Combat Will paired with Sense Strengthening was very convenient as it allowed him to execute quick judgment, but the headache and dizziness caused by the aftereffects were severe. If he had to suffer from the aftereffects amid this situation, it would be over for him.Yeon-woo drew three daggers from his waist and threw them at the Ant Queen.*Tang*Kiek!The Ant Queen lightly flung the daggers aside and let out a sardonic screech.However,*Swish**Puck*A fourth dagger flew in with a slight delay and struck deep into the Ant Queen\u2019s remaining eyeball.Kieeeek!The pain caused the Ant Queen to go into a frenzy.In the meantime,\u2018One minute, now!\u2019Yeon-woo slid underneath the belly of the Ant Queen and went past her. At the same time, he severed two of her remaining legs.*Kung*The Ant Queen\u2019s body tilted forward, and her head slammed onto the ground.The other ants started to assemble in order to protect their queen. The whole cave shook as they moved all at once.Meanwhile, he managed to reach the gate after passing through the ant\u2019s territory. At that moment, a massive headache and dizziness hit him as the effects of thought acceleration wore off.While holding in his vomit, Yeon-woo quickly entered the gate and closed it behind him.*Kwang*The gate shut just before the ants\u2019 legs could reach him. The place he found himself in was completely cut off from the ant tunnel, so none of the ants were able to enter the room.[You have entered the \u2018Temple of The Vampire Lord\u2019.]\u201cHoo.\u201dAs soon as he saw the message, Yeon-woo leaned against the wall, taking a second to catch his breath.*Kung Kung Kung*Outside, the ants were banging at the gate, trying to get him out of the room. He could also hear the Ant Queen\u2019s screeching noise occasionally.He didn\u2019t know whether this room and the ant tunnel were a completely separate dimension, or there was some kind of aura that was keeping them from approaching the temple. Nevertheless, the ants only kept pounding on the gate without even thinking of breaking into the room.Yeon-woo took a look around once his headache subsided.It was a small room with about 70 square meters of space. The ceiling covered the room from high above, and a beam of light streaming from above illuminated a part of the room. An altar was sitting in that spot, glowing with a crimson aura.There were five steps leading up to the altar. Bronze braziers were emanating an ominous green fire on both sides, and a statue was standing right in the middle. It was a woman with snake-shaped hair and long sharp fangs. Her lifelike eyes gave off the illusion of her coming alive.\u2018Bathory, the Lord of Vampires.\u2019Yeon-woo looked at her face and soon moved his gaze toward the dagger in her hand.A handle with a reddish tint, and azure blade uniquely shaped like a lightning bolt. It was about 30 centimeters long.\u2018That must be it, the most prized weapon of the Lord of Vampires.\u2019[Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword]Number 352Classification: One-handed WeaponRating: UniqueDescription: The Vampire Lord\u2019s most prized weapon. It has the ability to drain the blood of its opponent. The spirit of its previous owner resides within the sword, so it is known to personally choose its wielder. If the wielder isn\u2019t approved by the sword, it will constantly try to take over their mind.* Blood MarkIf the target is struck with a critical blow, the target will be inflicted with \u2018bleed\u2019. Targets under the effect of bleed will receive a certain percentage of the weapon\u2019s damage as damage over time.* Power of the Vampire LordAbility locked. (Sealed)Yeon-woo clenched his fist as he thought he had finally found it.Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword was a hidden piece that could help him narrow the gap between him and the frontrunners.The sword was also holding the legacy of the Vampire Lord, so he was expecting the sword would bring him steady growth even after advancing into The Tower.\u2018And this isn\u2019t all there\u2019s to it.\u2019Yeon-woo\u2019s eyes turned towards one of the item\u2019s options. The last option marked as locked, with the word \u2018sealed\u2019 next to it.Of course, even without this option, Bathory\u2019s Vampire Sword was remarkable enough. Not only the damage itself was high, but also the \u2018Blood Mark\u2019 option was above average. Even so, the real value of the artifact lied in the sealed option.\u2018Only with this option unlocked it can be called the true vampiric sword.\u2019Yeon-woo began to climb the stairs as the corners of his mouth turned up at the edges.At that moment, he felt as if the eyes of the statue were watching him carefully. Yeon-woo gently nodded so as to pay his respect and brought his hand to Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword.Then.\u2018Hup!\u2019Yeon-woo felt something piercing through his palm and squeezing into his body. It was something hot, sticky, and alien.The veins of his right hand holding the sword were bulging all the way up to his arm. The skin on his arm turned into a pale, dark reddish color, his veins tensed up as if they would burst at any moment.He could clearly see something black crawling up inside his veins.Yeon-woo gritted his teeth in enormous pain.The phrase \u201cpersonally choose its wielder\u201d written on the information window popped into his head.The Lord of Vampires was known as the greediest being of all time. Even though I never met her personally, I\u2019ve heard that all the people who had spoken with her had been shocked by greed. She was often compared with the Devil Archduke for her greed.If so, then how greedy is the sword she left behind?In order to properly wield the sword, he had to constantly withstand the threat that it posed to him. However, were players who had just entered the tutorial capable enough to suppress that kind of threat? That was the reason why several players who had found the sword had suddenly evaporated into thin air.If the sword was meant to be found by beginners, how should they handle it?And then, one day I had an idea. Since the sword was given as a hidden piece, wouldn\u2019t there be another way? Just like the way of eating White Moss?After spending a long time researching, his brother had found a way for beginners to deal with Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword.In a way, that was also a hidden piece.\u201cHidden piece of a hidden piece.\u201dYeon-woo spat out curses at the designer who had set this trap up to put the players in trouble.He lifted up the sword and stabbed the back of his left hand.*Snap*Others would have thought he was crazy if they saw it.However,*Tsss*Suddenly, the black energy that had climbed up to his right shoulder through his veins began to withdraw. Then it poured down into the back of his left hand at a rapid pace.The black energy congealed on the back of his left hand and his palm. At first, Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword seemed to contort, then it melted down and wound around his left hand. It looked as if it was being transplanted into his palm.There is a secret behind Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword. Although it looks like a weapon and it\u2019s described as an artifact in the tooltip, it has a true form it has been hiding from the players.\u2018If you\u2019re the one who chooses the wielder, I will force you to choose me.\u2019A skill.Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword was originally a\u00a0skill,\u00a0but posed an extreme difficulty.The Lord of Vampires was so greedy that she didn\u2019t want to pass her most prized weapon on to others even after her death. So she sealed off the sword\u2019s real form and ability and left it behind in the world.And it was only now that the seal had been lifted.*Ssss*Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword had now completely melted away.However, Yeon-woo\u2019s left hand looked no different from usual. So was his palm. It was completely normal.The black energy that had been radiating ominous aura until just now was nowhere to be seen. It was as if it had evaporated somewhere.Yeon-woo grinned and stretched out his hand. It was a flat palm with nothing on it. But the moment he focused his senses on his left hand,*Whoosh*Suddenly, black energy streamed out of his palm and gathered into a lump, then spread out like a vortex.When the process concluded, the skill had taken a shape resembling jaws full of serrated teeth like that of a beast.*Clank*The jaws opened and closed repeatedly.[The seal has been lifted.][(True) Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword]Number 66Proficiency: 0.0%Description: The Vampire Lord\u2019s most prized weapon\u2019s true form.

Black Route (6)Yeon-woo looked down at his left palm.*Clank* *Clank*The saw-toothed blade was clattering as if clamoring for food. Neither did it talk to him, nor expressed in any way, but Yeon-woo could still \u2018feel\u2019 its desire.\u2018So this is the vampiric sword.\u2019Yeon-woo smiled coldly as he gazed into the dark abyss that lied beyond its teeth.\u2018Now that I have this\u2026.\u2019Although it was definitely an excellent skill, Yeon-woo didn\u2019t feel any particular change in him. He felt like it was just another skill added to the skill list.But Yeon-woo was confident.He strengthened the grip of his left hand that was holding the vampiric sword. The teeth closed up and returned to their original form, but Yeon-woo could feel that it was still \u2018thirsty\u2019.\u2018Then, shall we go fill you up?\u2019*\u00a0\u00a0 * \u00a0 **Kung Kung Kung*The ants were still banging at the gate.Yeon-woo grabbed the handles and opened wide the gate.At that moment.Kieek!An ant let out a shriek and stepped one foot inside.Yeon-woo jumped forward, as he activated both Sense Strengthening and Combat Will at the same time.He had five minutes anew.*Pat*With a swing of his dagger, the ant\u2019s legs snapped as if it was made of foam. Yeon-woo jumped up, stepped on the ant and leaped high into the air.Kiek!Kieeeek!Underneath his foot, more than two hundred ants were screeching at him. They were enraged, wanting to slaughter the criminal who had destroyed their den. Amongst them, Yeon-woo easily spotted the Ant Queen.The Ant Queen also noticed Yeon-woo\u2019s presence, she spread her broken wings and inflated her body as much as possible. Both her eyes were damaged, it seemed she had captured his movements through other sensory organs.With her remaining three legs, she charged at Yeon-woo with fierce speed.[1] However this time Yeon-woo didn\u2019t avoid her. Rather, he landed directly on top of the Ant Queen\u2019s head.His movements had gotten much quicker and swifter.The Ant Queen clattered her mandibles as if ordering him to come down and started to swinging her head around.Yeon-woo spread his left palm wide and placed it over the queen\u2019s head.And he incanted the command word.\u201cDevour.\u201dAt that moment, the dark energy solidified under his left hand and revealed its fangs.*Crunch*And he sank the sword\u2019s teeth deep into the Ant Queen\u2019s head.The sword sucked in her bodily fluids at a frightening speed.[2][You have absorbed vitality and energy][\u2018Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword\u2019 skill proficiency has increased. 1.1%]Kieeek!The Ant Queen cried in soul-tearing pain.Even when she had been engulfed in flames, her eyes had been injured or got her legs cut off, her cries had never been this loud.Yeon-woo clung to her head like a bullfighter riding a bull. What\u2019s more, he sank his left hand deeper and deeper, with the intention of sucking everything out from the Ant Queen.Whenever the saw-toothed blade clattered, huge amounts of blood and body fluid were sucked into his left arm. He also felt a different \u2018substance\u2019 being sucked into his arm. It was the source of all Magic Power, mana.\u2018The message said I was extracting its vitality and energy. Was it talking about this?\u2019At the same time, Yeon-woo felt something accumulating somewhere in his body.[You have absorbed vitality and energy][Your Strength has increased by 1 point.][Your Health has increased by 2 points.]\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7As the messages pile up at a rapid pace, the Ant Queen began to wither away. Her body dried out, causing her exoskeleton to crumble like a sand castle, and her flesh lost its color due to the blood loss. Her struggle also grew weaker and weaker, and soon it died away.Once the skill stopped,*Kung*The Ant Queen\u2019s body that was now as dry as a mummy sank to the floor.It was the death of the Ant Queen.*Ding*[You have slain the boss monster, Blue Army Ant Queen. Additional Karma will be provided.][You have acquired 300 Karma.][The Blue Army Ants have been demoralized. The ant tunnel will soon collapse.]Kiek!Kieeek!The Army Ants that witnessed the death of their queen screamed in disbelief, and began to back away from Yeon-woo.They lost their chief who had protected them and the one who they were tasked to protect. The one now standing in her place was the \u2018predator\u2019 who could easily feed on them.Yeon-woo slowly stood up and turned towards the Army Ants. His eyes were emitting a red glow.[You have obtained a piece of \u2018Flame Heart and Frost Crest\u2019.][Current progress: 35.9%]The progress percentage had abruptly doubled.Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword extorted everything the opponent had. That was the reason why it could absorb all the attributes of the Ant Queen as a whole without having to eat the White Moss.No, it was actually much more efficient. Using this method he didn\u2019t have to bother with consuming the heart, since he could directly drain the energy from the monsters.Yeon-woo lifted the corners of his mouth.There were still a lot of monsters around with the pieces he needed. Each and every one of them was an appetizing prey.*Pat*Holding his dagger in a reverse grip, he flung himself at the rest of the monsters.[You have obtained a piece.][You have obtained a piece.]\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7[You have slain 311 additional Blue Army Ants.][You have completely destroyed the ant tunnel.][Additional Karma will be provided.]\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7* \u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 *The tutorial serves as a gateway to select new challengers that would enter The Tower.Naturally, various clans, rankers, and Guardians paid a lot of attention to what happened inside it, and a lot of work took place under the table in order to snatch outstanding individuals for themselves.Moreover, out of all rounds this round was particularly fascinating. That was because a large number of notable newcomers, often called \u2018rookies\u2019, were participating in this round.The One-horned Tribe, one of the martial tribes, known as the strongest combat species. Two sons of the Martial King, who ruled over the whole tribe were currently participating in this tutorial.There was also a swordsman of Marcusian descent, whose land is surrounded by a barren desert hence famous for their exceptional mercenaries.And then there were two people, popularly known as \u2019the dumbass duo\u2019, who had barely taken any part in the tutorial but kept saying they were aiming to become the top rankers.Contrary to what seemed like false bravado, not only were they the children of the top rankers, but they had also proven their excellence in the tutorial, demonstrating they didn\u2019t need to ride on their parents\u2019 coattails.Kahn and Doyle.Players had already given the two nicknames and called them:Blood Sword and Foxy Tail.[3]* \u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0 *\u201cHmm? Was there a place like this before? I never noticed it was here. At the very least he\u2019s good enough to finding a place like this. So, you sure he\u2019s in here?\u201d\u201cUghaam. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying. If you don\u2019t believe me, why don\u2019t you just head back?\u201d\u201cAw, who said I don\u2019t? Why are you so salty?\u201dDoyle answered Kahn\u2019s question, the young man with disheveled hair, question with a yawn and cast his eyes over to the other side.Then Kahn grinned and put his arm around Doyle\u2019s shoulder.Doyle made an annoyed look, but he still followed Kahn through the passage down the dungeon.They had been chasing after Yeon-woo after they decided to follow him in the waiting room of Section B.Kahn lightly clicked his tongue as he moved around the dungeon.\u201cSeems like someone has been hunting a heck of a lot of monsters.\u201dAll the way from the entrance up to this point, Kahn and Doyle had only encountered monsters\u2019 carcasses. Thanks to them, the dungeon was infested with a putrid stench.The monsters appeared to be highly strong, even for them who were fairly confident in the skills, making justice to the name of Black Route, as well as being a hidden piece dungeon.They noticed that the player the two of them were chasing after seemed to have struggled at first. There were hints of a fierce battle scattered around.They were wondering how could he still move with his, what should be, completely tattered body. But as time went by, as they walked deeper into the dungeon,\u201cThis is amazing. How can he grow so strong so quickly?\u201dThe results of the fierce battles were slowly becoming more and more lopsided. The player was definitely taking the upper hand. He was ferociously pushing ahead and was overwhelmingly hunting them down.\u201cMonsters here don\u2019t look any weaker.\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s funny to say this, but just by looking at the traces, the ones deeper in this dungeon are never weaker, if not stronger.\u201dKahn and Doyle, who originally followed Yeon-woo for fun, were slowly becoming serious. In particular, Kahn\u2019s usually playful atmosphere was now very calm and composed.Doyle felt odd when he noticed the change in his brother\u2019s attitude, as Kahn doesn\u2019t show his serious look very often. It was the look he showed only when he met someone he \u2018acknowledged\u2019, the look he had when encountering a rival.This meant that Yeon-woo was growing so rapidly that they could not think any less of him.At some point, they found signs of fleeing monsters.In an attempt to run away from the player, the monsters had even left their base and invaded other monsters\u2019 territories. Therefore, there had been territorial fights between monsters.A player who even terrorized monsters.Kahn and Doyle realized they could no longer take the situation as a joke, especially after coming across a dead body that seemed to have been sucked dry.Doyle turned around and looked at Kahn.\u201cHyung.\u201d\u201cYeah, I know. This in no joke anymore.\u201dKahn clamped his lips tight and nodded gravely.\u201cWhere on earth did he find this? When we conducted our search, there was not a sign of this.\u201dKahn muttered in a low voice.\u201cEnergy Drain.\u201dIt is the generic term for a skill that takes away the opponent\u2019s health or mana. It was extremely rare for among the numerous artifacts and skills in The Tower to be imbued with an energy drain ability. They would have never imagined that someone who was still in Section B of the tutorial would have such a unique ability.\u201cWas there a hidden piece in a place like this?\u201dKahn\u2019s eyes sparkled throughout his contemplation as he stroked his chin.He was a player who had not only cleared Section A solo, but had also acquired a rare artifact or skill from a hidden piece.Kahn was itching to team up with this guy.A player with this much skill was never readily available. Sooner or later, word of him would get out around the tutorial. Then all the other clans would avidly seek him.He had to take measures before that happened.Doyle looked into Kahn\u2019s eye and nodded as if he had read his mind.As they prepared to set foot to look for another trace,Kieeek!Beyond the corner of the passage, they heard monsters scurrying away.Kahn and Doyle moved quickly towards the origin of the noise.* \u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0 *Yeon-woo wielded his dagger to pierce the forehead of a brown salamander, and at the same time he laid his left hand on its jaws.\u201cDevour.\u201d*Crunch*With his left palm wide open, he thrusted the teeth into the monster\u2019s head. Then, the sword began to suck in bodily fluids and vitality at a rapid pace.Had he done this so many times, he was now used to this feeling.Thanks to the increased proficiency, the extraction speed had been boosted compared to when he had hunted the Ant Queen.At last, the moment Yeon-woo had been eagerly waiting for had come.[You have slain the Brown-scaled Salamander.][Number of monsters hunted: 1000][The maximum requirements for your quest have been fulfilled.][You have obtained a piece of \u2018Flame Heart and Frost Crest\u2019.][Current progress: 102.1%][All of the pieces have been collected.]It didn\u2019t take long for him to sweep through the ant tunnel and wipe out all of the remaining monsters.He had built up his attributes while he hunted the Army Ants, and he had become more efficient at gathering the pieces due to the Vampiric Sword.In the end, Yeon-woo managed to collect everything he needed in this dungeon.*Crunch* *Crackle*[The completed \u2018Flame Heart and Frost Crest\u2019 has began to take place in your body. Your body is experiencing changes.]Yeon-woo sensed a big change in his body. It was a change unparalleled to what he had experienced so far from gathering small pieces.As his muscles teared apart, his body began to eliminate waste matter through his pores. His skin that was full of wounds crumbled apart and peeled off. His joints softened up and something else squeezed in between his bones.He was in a lot of pain, but adrenaline spread across his body like wildfire, offering him an indescribable pleasure. And at the same time, something began to swirl quickly, clearly, and intensely along the entire body.It was mana.[1] 2+2+3=6 if you guys didn\u2019t know.[2] ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)[3] May change after the character is better explained.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Black Route (7)Yeon-woo\u2019s body was experiencing extreme changes. Mana was stimulating every corner of his body, causing his internal balance to collapse and restoring it at the same time.*Crunch* *Crackle*A long time passed.[\u2018Flame Heart and Frost Crest\u2019 has been completed.

But everything else had been successfully achieved.\u201cHoo.\u201dYeon-woo breathed out a long breath. Then all the fatigue he had piled up seemed to vanish, making him feel alive once again.\u2018Status window.\u2019[Player: Yeon-woo Cha]Traits: Cold-blooded, Reinforced PhysiqueStrength: 81 \u00a0\u00a0Dexterity: 83\u00a0\u00a0 Health: 89 \u00a0\u00a0Magic Power: 21Skills: Draconic Eyes(5.2%), Sense Strengthening(25.9%), Foresight(0.0%), Physical Resistance(10.2%), Combat Will(7.1%), Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword(3.2%)Yeon-woo was very pleased with his improved stats.Thanks to the energy of the monsters he had drained via Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword, his stats had gone through an incomparably steep increase. But there was something else that made Yeon-woo content the most. It was his new trait.\u2018Reinforced Physique\u2019.[Trait: Reinforced Physique]Description: Heart of flame and flesh of frost. The fire and frost element fused together granting great immunity and resistance. Fatigue does not build up easily.* Flame Heart: A heart embracing fire energy. Increases cardiorespiratory endurance and healing power. Stamina is greatly increased.* Frost Crest: Makes the body tougher. Increases resistance against physical impact and curses.Reinforced Physique toughened up the body and made it tireless.In particular, the self-healing ability gave him the advantage of reducing his chances of suffering a serious injury during critical situations. However, there was another reason why Yeon-woo needed this trait.[Body improvement has been confirmed. The vessel is strong enough. The halted succession process will resume. 6%\u2026 7%\u2026 12%\u2026.][Current progress: 21.3%][Your current status will be changed from \u2018Incomplete Dragon Body\u2019 to \u2018Immature Dragon Body\u2019]\u2018I made it.\u2019Yeon-woo clenched his fists.There were a couple of reasons why he needed this strengthened body. One reason was to gain an upper hand in the strenuous competitions that occurred throughout The Tower, but the biggest reason was to resume the succession process of Dragon Body.The completion of the succession process required a strong vessel. Reinforced Physique was the essential element for making such vessel.\u2018But this is just the beginning. I have to keep refining my vessel.\u2019Even so, the framework was already in place so he only had to keep advancing steadily as he had originally planned.As he enjoyed the feeling of his changed body, Yeon-woo recalled the system message that was left pending. It was the quest he had received when he first entered this dungeon. It was now time to claim his rewards.[You have acquired 1,500 Karma.][You have made an achievement that is not easily accomplished. Additional Karma will be provided.][You have acquired 500 additional Karma.][Additional rewards will be provided. Please select your reward.][Rewards List]* Artifacts1. Blood-Magic Blade2.

Snake Eyes\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Yeon-woo grinned as he scanned through the \u2018Rewards List\u2019.It was the first time he could choose his reward from a list, instead of just being given a random reward. He recognized some great items that he had previously seen in the mysterious merchant\u2019s catalog.It was a bit disappointing to have to choose only one out of the whole list, but Yeon-woo didn\u2019t fuss over it for long before scrolling down to the bottom of the list. There, he found what he wanted.98. 2000 additional KarmaHe got everything he could get from Section B, ranging from Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword to Reinforced Physique.He presumed there were many more rewards to gain from this point onwards, so nothing else in the list could grab Yeon-woo\u2019s attention.Anyhow, what Yeon-woo lacked the most right now was Karma points. Of course, even when adding this, he would still need a lot of Karma to achieve the top score he wanted.Yeonwoo tapped on reward number 98 right away.[2000 additional Karma has been selected as your reward.][You have acquired 2,000 Karma.]Additional messages popped up after he received his reward.[Your ranking in the tutorial has been updated.][Do you want to register your name on the ranking list?]\u2018I\u2019m finally in the rankings.\u2019The tutorial provided real-time rankings of players within the top 300 spots.Big announcements were made especially when there were significant changes within the rankings in order to encourage the players.Getting a message to register his name on the ranking list also meant he had made it to the top 300. However, Yeon-woo only put significance on the fact that he was in the ranking, and he didn\u2019t want to put his name on the list.There was no advantage in registering. It was only going to provoke hostility from other top rankers towards Yeon-woo. So he shook his head.\u2018Deny.\u2019[Registration denied. You will be shown as \u2018unknown\u2019 in the ranking. You can change this setting at any time.][Tutorial Ranking]1. Edora (57,111 Points)2. Phante (55,982 Points)3. Kahn (50,473 Points)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7281. Unknown (6,700 Points) (You)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u2018I\u2019m at 281st place.\u2019He had had a late start, but he was finally starting to catch up to the leading group to some extent.The total Karma he had accumulated so far was 6,700 points. Anybody would hardly believe that he had gathered all that before passing Section B.But his joy did not last long.\u2018I\u2019m glad I\u2019m in the rankings, but why is the gap so big?\u2019Yeon-woo narrowed his brows as he scrolled up the list again.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just that the leading players are better than I predicted.\u2019He was told that normally, the players with the most amount of Karma could gather around 50,000 points at most.His brother had collected about 52,000 Karma, and he had placed second at the end of the tutorial.However, even though there was still plenty of time left before the tutorial ended, there were already three people with more than 50,000 Karma,\u2018Edora, Phante, Kahn. Who are they?\u2019If they had joined the tutorial at different times, each one of them would have easily achieved first place.But Yeon-woo had to compete with all of them in the same round.Yeon-woo closed the ranking list as he burned their names into his mind.\u2018At this rate, it won\u2019t do. I\u2019ll have to speed up a lot.\u2019There was a gap of 50,000 Karma points between him and the leading group. Considering they were also proceeding fast, he needed to advance a lot faster.\u2018First things first, I have to reach Section E as soon as possible.\u2019The next hidden piece Yeon-woo was targeting was in Section E. It was where \u2018that guy\u2019 who he was looking for was living.There was nothing interesting to see in Section C and D. He was planning on skipping through those sections as quickly as possible.As he arranged his thoughts, Yeon-woo put his dagger back to his waist.He started moving on towards the exit.* \u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 *As he ventured down the passage to leave the dungeon,\u201cHmm?\u201dYeon-woo narrowed his eyes and looked at the direction of the exit. Then he pulled the dagger back out and held it tightly in his right hand.Beyond his range of sight, he sensed two unfamiliar figures.\u2018Players?\u2019The sound that monsters and players made were quite different, so he wouldn\u2019t mistake them.\u2018But I\u2019ve never seen any other players while I\u2019ve been here.\u2019He was wondering whether someone else had found this place.Yeon-woo hoped to not run into anybody if possible, but there was only one exit, so he moved with caution.What made Yeon-woo nervous were their skills.\u2018They might be tough.\u2019Judging by his senses, he could tell their levels weren\u2019t any lower than his. Even with Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword and Reinforced Physique, he wasn\u2019t sure if he could win.\u2018Maybe they are after me.\u2019Yeon-woo clasped his dagger.He pondered about how experts like them could still be at Section B. It made more sense to him to think that it wasn\u2019t just luck that brought them here, but instead revenge. They might be players from Arangdan wanting to avenge the players he had knocked down when he was helping Yul.Although it was unclear as to why such powerful men were working as lackeys in Arandan, Yeon-woo couldn\u2019t let them have their way, so he kept his presence hidden.And the moment when the two figures turned around the corner and showed their faces,*Pat*Yeon-woo swung his dagger aiming for the head of the innermost one. He was a boy with disheveled hair, sleepy eyes, and a baby-faced look.The boy noticed the attack, and opened his eyes wide. He tried to turn himself aside instinctively, but it seemed like it was too late.\u201cDoyle!\u201dJust then, the young man who was walking next to him swung his sword as he pulled the boy to his side.*Clang*Yeon-woo\u2019s dagger was blocked midway through its attack, and seemed to bounce off. However, the dagger was in fact snapped in half. It seemed that the sword the young man was wielding was of higher quality.Yeon-woo realized that his ambush had failed, and he jumped back, far from the two players. Then he took out two more daggers and held them in both hands.Doyle, the boy who got ambushed by Yeon-woo, collapsed on the floor roughly gasping for air with his face pale.Kahn, the young man who had managed to save his brother, flipped out and screamed at him.\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?!\u201dYeon-woo squinched his eyes underneath his white mask.\u201cArangdan, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by Arangdan?\u201dYeon-woo intuitively realized that the two in front of him were not related to Arangdan. If they were here to harm him, they wouldn\u2019t be talking with him instead of attacking him. Besides, the reflexes that saved Doyle and blocked his dagger were that of an expert.Of course, it could very well be just an act to throw him off guard. But with his expert level of skills, there was no need for him to lie.\u201cThen why were you following after me?\u201dKahn was a little surprised at the fact that Yeon-woo had noticed them tailing him, but frowned soon after.\u201cStill, that doesn\u2019t mean you should attack people without asking them why.\u201d\u201cWhat if you were being stalked by someone whose intentions were unknown? Of course, you would assume that they are up to no good. Am I wrong?\u201dEvery single word he said was perfectly correct. Kahn was struck dumb by his logic.\u2018The fuck? How is he so good at speaking?\u2019He had thought that Yeon-woo would be the blunt and silent type because of his eerie white mask.But he couldn\u2019t just chicken out of here.In the meantime, Doyle got over his shock and managed to stand up. Even though it happened because he was caught off guard, he was so shocked when he saw Yeon-woo\u2019s eyes emitting a savage aura incomparable to the atmosphere he had felt from him in the waiting room.For a second, Kahn glared at Yeon-woo, but soon he gave out a big sigh.Even though they were the ones who were ambushed, they were also the cause of the problem. He owed Yeon-woo an apology at least for that. Plus, he couldn\u2019t make a bad impression of himself when he was here to recruit him.*Thud*Kahn stuck his sword he was holding into the ground and said,\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t think that through.\u201dKahn made a clear apology. Doyle also bowed his head.Yeon-woo\u2019s eyes gave out a brilliant shine below his mask. He thought players in general had great affection towards themselves, that they were full of pride.Even if they were caught in the wrong, most of them tended to act innocent. But these two were innocently admitting their mistakes.Yeon-woo then realized they didn\u2019t have any bad intentions, so he let his guard down.He asked as he put his dagger back next to his waist.\u201cOkay. State your business.\u201dJust then, Kahn gave a mischievous smile and shouted confidently.\u201cYou should join my crew!\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dA short straight speech without any reasoning or logic.Doyle standing right next to him turned away his head in shame.Yeon-woo unwittingly narrowed his brows.\u2018Who the hell is this moron?\u2019If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Black Route (8)Not to mention their sudden appearance, they were now telling Yeon-woo to join their team.Yeon-woo\u2019s eyes scrutinized Kahn with an expression that asked what kind of man he was.Doyle nudged Kahn in the ribs with his elbow.\u201cOw! Why?\u201d\u201cStop doing that. Don\u2019t you ever feel ashamed?\u201d\u201cOf what?\u201dKahn had a puzzled look, not knowing what he had done.As Doyle let out a deep sigh, Yeon-woo considered they were no longer worth talking to, so he just walked past Kahn and Doyle while fixing his backpack\u2019s position.\u201cHey, dude! Where are you going! We\u2019re not done talking yet!\u201dKahn held Yeon-woo in a hurry.Yeon-woo stopped and looked back.\u201cWhat? Did you have anything left to say?\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t given an answer. I want you to join my team!\u201dYeon-woo gave a little snort. He didn\u2019t want to speak with this fool anymore, but he still replied indifferently.\u201cNegative.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI have no idea what you guys are up to, and I don\u2019t see any advantages in teaming up with you.\u201dKahn looked genuinely surprised.\u201cWait, you don\u2019t know me?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhat? Why?\u201dHe was talking as if it was something very obvious.\u201cBut\u2026 How? You really don\u2019t know me? I mean, it\u2019s me! How can you not recognize me? I\u2019m, like, the biggest star in the tutorial!\u201dKahn was making a fuss over Yeon-woo\u2019s reaction as if he had gone through something incomprehensible.By this time, Yeon-woo\u2019s indifferent expression was slowly being replaced with anger. Doyle watched Yeon-woo\u2019s reaction and thought that, at this rate, they might actually end up with nothing.So he decided to come forward and spoke to Yeon-woo in a polite tone.\u201cI apologize if we have offended you. My brother is very passionate about himself, so he tends to be self-absorbed and act a little foolish, and it sometimes becomes really exhausting to talk with him. But he\u2019s not a bad person, so I hope you understand.\u201dKahn had a look on his face asking what he\u2019d done wrong, but as Doyle glowered at him, he shut his mouth tight.The younger one sounded much smarter than his brother.Yeon-woo nodded as he looked at Doyle, thinking they could now carry on with the conversation.\u201cI\u2019m listening, but make it short.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll introduce ourselves. I\u2019m Doyle, and this foolish one over here is my brother, Kahn.\u201d\u201cDoyle? Kahn?\u201dTheir names were familiar to Yeon-woo.\u201cTutorial ranking 11th and 3rd?\u201dDoyle smiled timidly.\u201cIt\u2019s a little embarrassing if you put it like that.\u201dUnder the mask, Yeon-woo looked a little surprised.Kahn was in third place and Doyle was in eleventh place. They were among the top-ranked players.But why were the rankers, who should be way ahead of him, in a place like this? For a minute, he thought about the possibility of them being frauds.\u201cWell, I understand your doubt upon our presence here. You may be thinking we should be around Section E or F\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo. I believe you\u2019re the Doyle and Kahn.\u201d\u201cHuh? Really?\u201dYeon-woo nodded his head in silence. Going by his earlier thought, they didn\u2019t have a reason to lie to him.If anything, Yeon-woo had a way to tell that they weren\u2019t lying. It was his Draconic EyesHe examined them through his skill.It had recently come to his attention that when he examined living organisms with Draconic Eyes, those with negative or hostile thoughts seemed to have darker and more flaws compared to those with positive thoughts.Based on this fact, Yeon-woo was able to make a rough guess in regards to people\u2019s thoughts and emotions. It was also very helpful during monster hunts.The flaws Kahn and Doyle had were relatively lighter in color. This meant they were telling the truth.Yeon-woo asked with his arms crossed.\u201cSo, why would players like you two, who should be busy clearing the tutorial and stacking up Karma, bother to return all the way back to this section and recruit a player like me?\u201dDoyle scratched his cheek with his finger.He wanted to keep it secret, but after realizing that it would be hard to persuade Yeon-woo without sharing information, he decided to provide information to a certain extent.He was prepared to subdue Yeon-woo if he were to pull any kind of nonsense.\u201cBefore we get into this, I must ask you something.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cDo you belong to any team or clan?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dDoyle\u2019s face lit up at Yeon-woo\u2019s response. Kahn also let out an \u2018Oh\u2019 in amazement.\u201cThat\u2019s great. In fact, there\u2019s an artifact that we have to get from Section E, but we must have at least three or four members in our team.\u201d\u201cYou could have recruited someone from Section E.\u201d\u201cBy the time players reach the latter sections, they are usually already part of other teams or clans.\u201dYeon-woo was starting to get a rough idea of their story.These were two of the top rankers in the tutorial. In order to prevent the information about the hidden piece from spreading, every move they made had to be done with caution.But players with great skills usually belonged to other teams, so they couldn\u2019t hire those players because they were afraid their plans might leak out. Therefore, they must have thought they would have a greater chance of finding solo players in Section B.\u2018Did they use tickets to travel back to former sections?\u2019Yeon-woo presumed it wasn\u2019t the reset ticket he had used before. It must have been some kind of pass ticket that allowed them to travel freely. Of course, they must have just bought a one-time use ticket since that was also costly.\u2018It\u2019s hard to check players\u2019 skill in Section A. They must have found me during their search in Section B.\u2019Perhaps his performance of passing through Section A solo and smashing Kaen\u2019s party must have caught their eyes. Yeon-woo didn\u2019t know he would draw others attention in this way, so he chuckled a little bit.\u201cYou\u2019re saying, there is an artifact in Section E which is hard to acquire even for the 3rd and 11th rankers, and you need someone to help you with it. Is this correct?\u201d\u201cYes, I can\u2019t tell you the details, though.\u201dYeon-woo nodded and thought to himself.\u2018It looks like they need Hargan\u2019s Crown.\u2019There were also several hidden pieces in Section E. Fortunately, the one they wanted was different from what Yeon-woo was after.Below the point where the three trees are entangled in Section E, there is a lair where the Lizardman King named Hargan dwells. We had a hard time raiding this monster.It was a hidden piece his brother and his team Arthia had also stumbled upon.His brother mentioned that as the chief of the Lizardman tribe that often appeared in Section E, Hargan was very difficult to deal with.In particular, the huge amount of Lizardmen Warriors guarding their chief added to the difficulty.Furthermore, compared to the efforts his team had poured into it, the rewards were too small. So his brother had been so angry at it that he made a comment in his diary.Thus, Yeon-woo was thinking of avoiding Hargan\u2019s lair. He was very short on time. There was no need to waste his time on such a worthless area. He would rather spend his time on another hidden piece and gain more Karma and rewards.But more importantly, the item Hargan dropped, \u2018Hargan\u2019s Crown\u2019, was an artifact worth too little to Yeon-woo.\u2018Hargan\u2019s Crown has an option that increases Dignity and Leadership. I don\u2019t really need those.\u2019Yeon-woo\u2019s style of combat was that of a \u2018one man army\u2019. No matter how many enemies he faced, he overwhelmed his enemies all by himself.Conducting an army? Or having a lot of teammates? Although it seemed convenient, it didn\u2019t suit Yeon-woo\u2019s taste.Even when running a mission, he only brought a few subordinates as his companions and had never directed large-scale operations.What\u2019s more, his younger brother had been betrayed by his trusted teammates.The law of the jungle prevailed in The Tower. If one were to show their back to the enemy, they might get eaten alive. He could easily let his guard down and expose his weaknesses in such a fierce jungle if he had teammates.Even if he had teammates, it would be only one or two. It was a number he thought that wouldn\u2019t be much of a burden, also easy to dispose of.So Yeon-woo had no interest in Hargan\u2019s Crown, which seemed to be helpful only for the commander types.\u201cYou won\u2019t be disappointed with the compensation. We can also adjust the conditions if you need anything else. How does this sound? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not a bad deal, even for you.\u201dKahn and Doyle should be desperate to move on to section E as soon as possible, so they would try to help Yeon-woo by any means necessary. He could quickly raise his ranking and he could even find a hidden piece if he should team up with them.Most importantly, he couldn\u2019t ignore the advantage of being acquaintanced to these two who would become super-rookies once they finished the tutorial.He could possibly join the team these two organized and form an influential clan inside The Tower.\u2018Certainly, I would have liked the sound of that, only if I were one of those regular players.\u2019Yeon-woo didn\u2019t really need the help from Kahn and Doyle and definitely didn\u2019t need a team. Rather, they would get in his way.He had to keep looking for the other hidden pieces in the future, and he couldn\u2019t afford to have any distractions. So Yeon-woo was going to turn down their offer.However, a sudden idea occurred to his mind.\u2018It wouldn\u2019t hurt to help them just for a little bit, would it?\u2019After all, he had planned to skip Section C and D straight away. He had his own business in Section E, but what if he could help these two before that?Hunting Hargan wasn\u2019t going to be easy, but if he could cooperate with rank number 3 and rank number 11, a quick raid didn\u2019t sound impossible.No matter how worthless it was, a hidden piece was still a hidden piece. He should be able to collect a large amount of Karma with this raid.If he could gain all that just by exerting a bit of effort, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad exchange.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll help you, but on one condition.\u201dDoyle made a broad smile as if he was saying he made the right decision.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cApart from the artifact you need, I\u2019d like to take all the other rewards.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t an easy matter.Of course, Hargan\u2019s Crown was the most important item for them, but he did not know what other rewards were awaiting at Hargan\u2019s Lair, so Doyle didn\u2019t want to make any rash judgement. He looked back at Kahn.Kahn gave a silent nod.Whatever the conditions may be, what mattered to them was that it would be a quick raid. They didn\u2019t need anything else other than the crown.Eventually, Doyle gave him a knowing look and gave Yeon-woo a positive answer.\u201cOkay, it\u2019s all yours. However, you must show us what you have.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I know you are going to recruit someone else or even abandon me if I\u2019m below your standard.\u201dDoyle let out an awkward laugh as if he had hit the bull\u2019s eye.\u201cHehe, we\u2019re not that cruel, you know.\u201dKahn suddenly came up front, as if he couldn\u2019t wait any longer to talk with him. He then cracked a smile and held out his hand.\u201cUhaha! Anyway, it\u2019s so good to see you. So, tell me your name, bro.\u201dYeon-woo clearly saw what kind of personality Kahn had.He was a typical snobby, talkative man who was just tiring to deal with. But for the time being, he was stuck with this guy, so he bit his lips and grabbed his hand.And as he realized he hadn\u2019t said his name, he was going to say his name but soon paused.He reminded himself that this was another battlefield.He didn\u2019t have to reveal his real name. Instead, he gave them his code name, his second identity for when he was on the battlefield.\u201cCain.\u201dYeon-woo\u2019s eyes were looking resolute.\u201cI\u2019m Cain.\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Deal (1)Now that he had no reason to stay in the dungeon any longer, Yeon-woo left the dungeon accompanied by Kahn and Doyle.\u201cWell, here comes the god damn Heavyweight Water again.\u201dKahn had disgusted expression as he glanced towards the pond. Like Yeon-woo, he had also chosen the Black Route and had experienced difficulties when crossing through it.High in density, devoid of buoyancy, strong water pressure that restrained the body\u2019s movements, and the pond was also filled with of aquatic monsters. Just by thinking of passing through the pond got his back up.At the same time, Kahn was curious about how Yeon-woo would pass this ordeal. Inside the dungeon, he had only seen hints of Yeon-woo\u2019s skills. So this was the first time he would actually see his abilities. He would decide whether to seek additional members or not, based on Yeon-woo\u2019s capability or potential growth.But then,\u2018Huh?\u2019Yeon-woo was walking towards the pond without any preparation.\u201cHey, dude!\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dYeon-woo glanced over Kahn asking what was wrong.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re thinking of jumping straight in. I mean, you haven\u2019t made any preparation.\u201d\u201cDo you have a problem with that?\u201d\u201cBro, you\u2019re gonna get yourself into a big tro\u2026!\u201dBut Yeon-woo jumped into the pond before even Kahn could finish speaking.Kahn was about to rush in thinking that Yeon-woo might be sinking down in excruciating pain.\u201cI suppose we didn\u2019t have to worry, did we?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201dYeon-woo was swimming with complete ease, like a fish in water.While Doyle was smiling, Kahn was looking a bit abashed. He had confirmed in the dungeon that Yeon-woo was somewhat skilled, but this was just a whole different level. He started thinking that he might have snatched someone greater than he had anticipated.\u2018This guy has grown so much even before clearing Section B. How much more can he grow by venturing through the rest of the sections?\u2019Kahn smiled at Yeon-woo who was currently cleaving through the water.\u2018Maybe.\u2019A thought occurred to him, that Yeon-woo might be someone who will set the whole tutorial on fire, just like him.He would always welcome another expert.* \u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 *Not caring about Kahn\u2019s surprise, Yeon-woo analyzed his new body as he clove through the Heavyweight Water.\u2018So this is what Flame Heart and Frost Crest does. It\u2019s so good.\u2019If a normal person were to jump in this water, their body would be crushed by the pressure. But thanks to Reinforced Physique, his body didn\u2019t hurt a bit.The Flame Heart was constantly pumping an enormous amount of vitality throughout his body, and the Frost Crest had hardened his skeleton enough to withstand the pressure from the Heavyweight Water. For Yeonwoo, this was no different from an ordinary bath on Earth.Then, Yeon-woo began to wonder how would Kahn and Doyle cross the pond, so he turned back and watched.Kahn, who was physically fit, took another piece of cloth out of his pocket and tied his sword next to his waist before jumping into the water. He was a good swimmer. Doyle, on the other hand,\u201cWhat is that? Is that his skill?\u201dAs Doyle made a subtle gesture in the air. From the walls, a swarm of flies suddenly flocked above the pond. The flies were forming some kind of cloud.Doyle moved forward as he stepped on the dark cloud made out of flies. With every step he took, the bugs moved along and made a bridge beneath his feet. It was truly a peculiar sight.Many flies were trampled to death, but more flies came and filled their spot, making it easy to move.\u2018He belongs to the tamer class, maybe entomopathy?\u2019Tamers, especially those with zoopathy, were often accompanied by specific animals because they valued communion with their animals.But entomopathists had to deal with bugs that possessed low levels intelligence, so it was harder and more complicated. He didn\u2019t expect to see one with his own eyes in the tutorial.It also made some sense now as to why the 11th ranker couldn\u2019t react to his attack. He relied on his skills and entomopathy, so his physical ability fell short.\u2018That reminds me, didn\u2019t he say Black Skull was also good at entomopathy?\u2019For a second, he recalled a ranker in The Tower. But Yeon-woo shook his head and erased the name from his mind. They were going to meet one day, but he didn\u2019t have to worry about it now.After confirming that Kahn and Doyle were following him, Yeon-woo took a deep breath and dived into the water. Inside the pond was pitch black, as if he had dived deep into the sea. So he had to strengthen his senses to the fullest extent.*Kwang*Yeon-woo gave a powerful kick and glided through the water.The water felt cool and fresh against his skin, maybe it was because it had been a while since had experienced such fast movement.* \u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0 *Bild, the executive of Arangdan, was frowning at the report. It was about the villain who had destroyed Kaen\u2019s party and disappeared into the Black Route. Bild had finally discovered his whereabouts, he was at the Heavyweight Water pond in Section B. It seemed he hadn\u2019t made any progress because of its high difficulty.But when he was about to take off, he was caught by the following report.\u201cSir, we have a problem.\u201d\u201cWhat problem?\u201d\u201cKahn and Doyle were also spotted next to him.\u201d\u201cWhat? Why are they with him? They are supposed to be at Section E, aren\u2019t they?\u201dKhan and Doyle, along with the siblings from the Cheong-lam family, were also taking the spotlight. Even Cheonghwado, the force behind Arangdan, paid close attention to their every move. And now all of a sudden they had appeared here.Bild thought that the villain they were looking for didn\u2019t have any connection to people in The Tower.\u201cWe don\u2019t have accurate information yet, so we\u2019re still investigating. However, we have some reports saying that those two haven\u2019t been seen in Section E recently, and some people witnessed two men that fit their description.\u201dBild glared at the subordinate.\u201cAnd why is it just now that I am hearing about this?\u201dThe subordinate gave an excuse with his shoulders hunched.\u201cThe reports came from an earlier section, so we thought it was unimportant.\u201d*Kwang*Bild slammed the table with his fist.\u201cSo what does that suppose to mean? Did they team up with each other?\u201dThe subordinate lowered his head as he lost face.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s our assumption.\u201d\u201cSo he\u2019s got somebody behind him. Khan, Doyle. You dirty pieces of shit.\u201dBild gritted his teeth as he recalled the images of the dumbass duo\u2019s faces. He took this situation as none other than a declaration of a war.They must have recruited the masked guy even though they knew he had stirred trouble with Arangdan. This was clearly treating Arangdan, or even Cheonghwado, with disdain.\u201cLet\u2019s head to where he is now. Assemble the members.\u201d\u201cThey are all currently waiting outside.\u201dJust as Bild nodded and was about to move to the gathering place, another subordinate suddenly hurried into the room.\u201cA new report just arrived! They\u2019ve cleared Section B and have arrived at Section C!\u201d\u201cThen we\u2019ll go that\u2026\u201dBut before Bild could even finish his sentence, more subordinates kept barging in with their reports over and over.\u201cWe have another report! They\u2019ve broken through Section C!\u201d\u201cCurrently found in the enterance of Section D\u2026\u201d\u201cNo! They\u2019ve cleared Section D and entered Section E!\u201d\u201cThey are in\u2026\u201d\u201cKahn and Doyle are following behind\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t comprehend the situation due to the continuous stream of reports.The network Arangdan had in the tutorial was very tight, there were usually no errors. Judging by this sudden flood of reports, it could only mean one thing.\u2018A speedrun\u2019But even if he got help from Kahn and Doyle, the speed of their progress was beyond comprehension.\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201dThe look on his face hardened.*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *[269:36:55_41][You have successfully cleared the Black Route of Section B as a solo player.][You have made an achievement that is not easily accomplished.

Is he the same guy who was in Section B a while ago? How can he grow so fast?\u2019Kahn was so stunned that he couldn\u2019t help but laugh.He had to admit that he had been wrong. He had once believed that this guy might actually grow into one of the strongest, and that one day he would become a dark horse that might threaten the rankers position.The reality, however, was much different from what he thought.\u2018He was already one!\u2019When they first crossed through the Heavyweight Water with Yeon-woo, Kahn thought he had found something good. But as soon as they entered Section C, he had to completely change his evaluation of him.*Kwang**Swish*\u201cHuman! Human\u2019s here\u2026 *Gurgle*\u201d\u201cHuman, too strong! Chief, need\u2026 Kuk!\u201dYeon-woo cleared Section C too easily, as he literally \u2018swept\u2019 past the monsters that stood in his way.Unlike previous sections that consisted of a straight path, Section C was a labyrinth formed by dozens of caves connected like a cobweb. Of course there was only one exit, and the way was complex.In addition, at the end of the maze was the den of a Hobgoblin and hordes of Goblins.The monsters regarded players in Section C as intruders who were invading their den, so they continuously sent scouts to prevent players from advancing.Then the player had to advance by either avoiding the scouts or exterminating them. If they were caught, the worst case scenario would be that they might have to face the whole tribe of Goblins. No matter how skilled players were, they couldn\u2019t match such an overwhelming number of monsters.In brief, the whole challenge Section C offered was finding a way out of the maze while playing hide-and-seek with Goblins, and that was how most players cleared Section C. Whereas Yeon-woo, he ignored all of the rules.He pushed forward as if he didn\u2019t care about whoever came to fight him. Naturally, his method caused a huge disturbance throughout the whole den.Hearing the news of this massacre, Goblins swarmed at Yeon-woo, but he achieved victory by simply clashing head-on with them. And soon after that, he also took the Hobgoblin\u2019s life.The same thing happened in Section D. Even the Trolls that were guarding the stone chamber were slain with a single strike.*Spurt*When it came to the physical power and resilience, Trolls were said to be one of the hardest monsters to beat even with a party of five or more players. And those Trolls were now getting ripped into pieces.Doyle wasn\u2019t confident if he himself could produce such an overwhelming scene, so he only watched Yeon-woo with a stern look. No words came out of his mouth.Despite displaying such a spectacle, Yeon-woo calmly started to dissect the carcasses of the Trolls without showing any sign of fatigue.When Kahn and Doyle finally opened their mouth, they asked what was he doing with the dead monster.\u201cTheir blood is an important ingredient for brewing health potions. Their tendons and leather are also great materials for other items.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHe even answered back with a question asking if there was something wrong with it.Ranging from raiding to looting, Yeon-woo was squeezing out everything he could from the tutorial.* \u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 *[Your ranking in the tutorial has been updated.][Tutorial Ranking]1.

Deal (2)*Shuck* *Shuck*\u201cWhat are you gonna do with all that?\u201dKahn asked Yeon-woo with a disgusted look.Yeon-woo stopped collecting the Troll\u2019s skin and looked up at Kahn.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? The blood is an ingredient for potions\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t asking about that.\u201d\u201cThen what?\u201d\u201cWell, what\u2019s the point of keeping the materials? You must have gathered a lot of Karma by now. And you\u2019re definitely not stopping, right? Then why can\u2019t you just buy items with your Karma?\u201dOnce players made their entrance into The Tower, Karma points could be used as currency. If they wanted an item or an artifact, they could pay Karma to purchase whatever they needed. Therefore, players weren\u2019t too keen on looting materials which were considered as \u2018scrap items\u2019 from monsters\u2019 carcasses.Even if they really needed materials, they\u2019d prefer to hire other players or simply buy them with points.Of course, rare materials from greater monsters like an Elder Dragon were a different story. Even so, those items were for giant clans or special raiding teams to deal with. That\u2019s why solo players rarely handled scrap items.However, Kahn noticed that even while they were speedrunning through the sections, Yeon-woo was never reluctant to gather materials from dead bodies. Ever since hunting Goblins, whenever he found intact carcasses he would make a pause to loot.His looting process was also very delicate. When filling a bottle with blood, he would make his best effort to not get the blood mixed with foreign substances, and when collecting important materials he wrapped them in leather and stored them separately.Because of this, despite his effort to take with him only valuable ingredients, Yeon-woo\u2019s backpack was so full of materials that it looked like a balloon that was about to burst.\u201cI have plans for these materials.\u201d\u201cIf you say so.\u201dKahn no longer tried to understand Yeon-woo.Although his actions appeared to be meaningless to Kahn, he discovered that each of them was thoroughly planned.Besides, knowing that individualism was major element of The Tower, he couldn\u2019t meddle in Yeon-woo\u2019s business. But he was far too nosy to endure his growing curiosity, so he asked one last question.\u201cBy the way, is there anyone who can handle so many ingredients all at once? Don\u2019t get caught up in a scam and end up crying like a baby.\u201dAfter packing all the ingredients, Yeon-woo lifted the backpack with his shoulders. Because of the tears and punctures it got from previous sections, his backpack had patches of leather all over the place, giving off an uncanny impression.\u201cI do know a blacksmith.\u201d\u201cOh. He must be good then?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201dYeon-woo shrugged his shoulders and walked past Kahn. He didn\u2019t want to bother talking anymore.Kahn only smacked his lips.\u2018Gosh, what a jerk.\u2019During the whole time he stayed beside Yeon-woo, the biggest thing that Kahn had felt so far was that Yeon-woo always played his cards close to his chest.As far as he knew, most people tended to share their stories after hanging around for a while. However, Yeon-woo never brought up anything about his identity. He only spoke what he needed to say.Sometimes, his callous look from underneath the white mask gave him chills on the back.Of course, in the dog-eat-dog world of the tutorial and The Tower, his personality wasn\u2019t necessarily bad. He knew Yeon-woo was trying not to reveal his weaknesses.Also, his friendliness might have looked suspicious to Yeon-woo, since they were barely acquainted with each other. But still, he had this \u2018feeling\u2019 that Yeon-woo was intentionally building a wall around himself.Kahn prided himself on being highly sociable and profoundly empathetic. Due to that, he could feel it more so.\u2018But there are not many players with that much skill, I\u2019d like to keep him close if possible.\u2019Kahn stroked his chin with his hand.If he were to describe Yeon-woo with one word, he would say \u2018reliable\u2019. Although he never talked about himself, he also never interfered with other people\u2019s affairs. And at the same time, he conducted his work without a complaint. He even showed excellent ability by clearing two sections nonstop.Kahn wanted Yeon-woo so badly because he had a \u2018big plan\u2019 in mind. He wanted him, not for this raid only, but for the whole journey throughout The Tower. But he felt like Yeon-woo wasn\u2019t letting him get closer.\u2018Maybe it\u2019s his mask.\u2019By the time Kahn finished thinking, Yeon-woo had already opened the iron gate leading outside of Section D.*Rumble*He felt the whole cave quaking when he pushed the iron gate that was thicker than any other the gate they had passed.Then, a stream of warm and bright sunshine poured inside the cave where only dim lights gleamed. There, he saw the blue sky.[You have successfully cleared Section D as a solo player.][You have made an achievement that is not easily accomplished. Additional Karma will be provided.][You have acquired 3,000 Karma.][You have acquired 2,000 additional Karma.][Your health and mana will be restored][All status effects will be removed][You have entered Section E][You have successfully reached the Outer Area. Additional Karma will be provided.][You have acquired 1,000 additional Karma.]Yeon-woo swept his hair back with his hands. A fresh crisp breeze came blowing towards him. He felt extremely refreshed.\u201cUgh! It was getting stuffy in there!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a little sad to leave. It was the perfect place for a nap.\u201dKahn stretched himself, and Doyle rubbed his sleepy eyes.The tutorial could be roughly categorized into two areas. The \u2018Inner Area\u2019 and \u2018Outer Area\u2019.The Inner Area referred to the first areas ranging from Section A to Section D, which were designed to help new players realize their level of skill and to train for what they lacked. The Outer Area referred to the later areas ranging from Section E to Section G, which tested the skills that players\u2019 had trained in the Inner Area and had them attest to their qualifications.Usually, players would easily accumulate stress because the trials in the Inner Area were conducted in narrow caves and passageways with bad lighting and poor ventilation. But there was nothing like that in the Outer Area.Seeing the outside world after so long, Yeon-woo also felt the stuffiness going away. But he couldn\u2019t relax because he knew that The Outer Area would be even more dangerous than the Inner Area.\u201cUntil Section D the space was limited by walls, so I only had to watch out within a certain range. There\u2019s nothing like that from Section E onward.\u2019Being in an open area also meant exposing himself to the enemy.Different messages started popping up while Yeon-woo was focused on his thoughts.[The challenge of Section E will begin.]At that moment, Yeon-woo saw a flash of light on his palm.A small bead about the size of half a finger appeared where the light had just flashed.[You have been given one \u2018Token\u2019. Multiple Tokens are hidden throughout Section E, they can also be transferred or traded between players. Collect 99 Tokens to ascertain your qualifications]Yeon-woo fidgeted with the bead-shaped Token. Next to him, Kahn watched with nauseated look.\u201cIt pisses me off whenever I see that.\u201dYeon-woo looked at the Token quietly.Section E was more of a deathmatch. There were Tokens hidden all over the section, but it was much easier to rob someone else of what they had collected than to collect it for yourself.So players in Section E often got paranoid. They didn\u2019t know when they would get hit by something unexpected, but also didn\u2019t know if the teammates they had been laughing with until now would stab them in the back.What\u2019s more disgusting, is that \u2026Yeon-woo focused on the message about the Token being able to be transferred or traded between players. This meant that it was possible to threaten or even kill others to take their Tokens.To find Tokens hidden throughout the whole Section E was a difficult task. Rather than that, it was easier to stay hidden and ambush other players and kill them to steal their Tokens.It was as plain as day which option players would choose.His brother had a hard time dealing with such problems. But what made Arthia distinguish itself from the others was that despite all the temptations, they managed to pass Section E solely by collecting hidden Tokens without resorting to betrayal.\u2018Those Hyenas will surely come for me.\u2019The scavengers, also known as Hyenas. Section E was infested with Hyenas using the forest as their cloak. He had to watch out for them.Then, Yeon-woo suddenly recalled the nefarious team he saw in the diary. The ones who captured players alive and used them to farm Tokens.His brother and Arthia stepped up and wreaked havoc on their team, but what if the remnants or other copycats made a resurgence?Then Yeon-woo shook his head at the idea. Unlike his righteous and altruistic brother, he was a completely self-centered person. Even if he witnessed such crimes, he would most likely ignore it. His hands were already full with his own business. He had to stay out of trouble.Then Yeon-woo glanced toward the two standing next to him.To his relief, Kahn and Doyle only stared at Yeon-woo\u2019s Token, and they didn\u2019t look interested in taking it. It seemed like they had already collected quite a lot of Tokens before going back to Section B.\u2018Or they could\u2019ve already collected all 99 Tokens.\u2019Yeon-woo then put his Token in his mouth and swallowed it.Kahn and Doyle looked at him with a newfound interest. By swallowing Token, Yeon-woo showed his will of not yielding to other players until dead. They got a glimpse of Yeon-woo\u2019s conviction.\u201cI\u2019m done reading messages, so let\u2019s get a move on. You said you\u2019re looking for a hidden piece in Section E, correct? Then let\u2019s get it done now. I have to go find Tokens afterward\u201dKahn nodded.\u201cYeah, but there\u2019s quite a distance from here. It\u2019s gonna take us a while until we get there.\u201d\u201cThen we\u2019ll gather Tokens on our way.\u201d\u201cFine by me.\u201dKahn took the lead and set off on their way.Yeon-woo and Doyle followed behind.* \u00a0\u00a0* \u00a0 *Section E boasts a much larger and wider area than all four of the preceding sections combined.Thanks to this, each area has its own geographic feature within a different environment, forming a unique ecosystem.Small hills are spread out to the south, a vast forest is covering the northern region, and at the end of the forest lies a muddy swamp. Black rocky mountains are lined up behind a barren desert along the east side, and a river flowing through a prairie stretches westward.And each area is also inhabited by a wide variety of monsters.Small monsters like Goblins and Kobolds form villages around the forest, but larger monsters such as Trolls and Ogres live deep in the forest. Lizardmen, Sandworms, and settlements of Orcs were each seen in the northern swamp, eastern desert, and western prairie.The ordeal is about finding Tokens while dealing with the monsters and guarding their Tokens against players who may be even more dangerous than these monsters. Both are important.And now,Yeon-woo\u2019s party was heading towards the swamp at the north.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 85": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Second Life RankerCH 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 22. Deal (3)As darkness fell, Yeon-woo\u2019s party made preparations to camp outside.When he was in the Inner Area, Yeon-woo would only take short naps from time to time due to being unable to distinguish night from day. But now that he could, he didn\u2019t have to continue doing that. Most importantly, Kahn had suggested the idea in order to stay in top shape.\u201cThe monsters we\u2019ll be dealing with are pretty tough. We have to be fully prepared.\u201dYeon-woo nodded in agreement.Although Yeon-woo feigned ignorance, he knew what Kahn and Doyle were looking for. Hargan, the Lizardman King. As one of the boss monsters in Section E, Hargan was powerful enough to easily crush normal players. The top-ranked duo, Kahn and Doyle, couldn\u2019t guarantee whether they would win against him. And the even bigger problem was that,\u2018He is not alone.\u2019There were two Lizardman Kings in total. One male and one female. The only reason the name of this hidden piece was \u2018Hargan\u2019s Lair\u2019 was because it was named after the male one. However, the real owner was the female one that resided deeper inside the lair, not the male. If you let yourself feel relieved after hunting only the male, you would find yourself in big trouble.\u2018The one that has Hargan\u2019s Crown is also the female Lizardman King. These two must have already figured it out.\u2019To take the crown, there had to be at least one player in charge of each, male and female, Lizardman King. Even if Kahn risked his own life, he could only handle one of them at a time, so he must have needed someone to take on the other one.Doyle, whose physical strength was relatively weak, could only take on the role of seizing the crown while the monsters\u2019 aggro was focused on someone else. That\u2019s why all three of them had to be in their best possible condition before setting foot into Hargan\u2019s Lair.Kahn and Doyle, perhaps because they had a lot of experience sleeping outside, quickly got themselves ready to camp. Doyle, in particular, showed Yeon-woo a very fascinating sight when he lit the bonfire. Using his entomopathy, he summoned some kind of bugs and made them line up on top of the firewood. The bugs suddenly burst into flames, creating a spectacular display of sparks.\u201cImpressive.\u201dDoyle gave a coy smile in response to Yeon-woo\u2019s short exclamation.\u201cThey are called flamebugs. When facing their natural enemies, they\u2019ll ignite themselves on fire and combust the enemy along with them. The Tower is full of such wonderful insects.\u201dWhile nodding his head, Yeon-woo looked at the remains of the flamebugs slowly fading in the flames.\u2018There are still so many things in The Tower that even Jeong-woo didn\u2019t know about.\u2019Not everything about The Tower was recorded in the diary. Yeon-woo for sure would need to explore those things that were not recorded.As the bonfire burned brightly, they made themselves comfortable in their respective sleeping bags. After deciding to take turns to keep watch during the night, they fell asleep one by one.* \u00a0\u00a0 * \u00a0\u00a0 *Yeon-woo was the first one to keep the night-watch. There was no particular reason for this. It was just because he had won in rock-paper-scissors.*Crackle*Yeon-woo calmly stared at the burning firewood, and opened one of his hands. Five blue beads rolled over his palm. They were Tokens.\u2018Together with the one I originally had, I have six Tokens now.\u2019Yeon-woo didn\u2019t just walk along during the journey to Hargan\u2019s Lair. He had been looking for the Tokens hidden and sparsely placed throughout the forest. In the crevice of a rock, by a brook, up on a tree, in a bird nest, and so on.But they weren\u2019t too hard to find.\u201cI never would\u2019ve imagined that my strengthened senses could even capture the position of the Tokens.\u2019The Tokens were somewhat special. It was as if they contained some sort of special power, the feeling he got when sensing them was different from that of other objects lying around.\u2018I need to collect as many Tokens as possible. As the amount of Tokens I gather increases, so will the Karma I gain. Especially from the 100th Token onwards, there will be a drastic increase, so I have to stay focused.\u2019Of course, his search for Tokens was conducted in secret. There was no need to let Kahn and Doyle know about it.The two were even showing signs of remorse, saying how Yeon-woo was unable to find any Token due to being busy helping them with their raid. Doyle went much further and even brought up the idea of offering him Tokens in compensation.Whether they meant it or not, Yeon-woo thought they must be real good guys, considering the fact that they were in a place where egoism was prevalent.\u2018By the way\u2026.\u2019Yeon-woo tossed the five Tokens into his mouth and raised his head up to see the moon.Proving that this place was different from the Earth, one large and one small moons were hanging high in the night sky.\u2018Have I already made all the way up here? Time does go fast.\u2019He was feeling a bit awkward from being able to enjoy the night breeze at ease. Yeon-woo wondered if it was because he had been passing through the sections without a break.To him, having this kind of peaceful time was like a square peg in a round hole. He hadn\u2019t had a good rest ever since entering the tutorial. He had been rolling over the floor, stabbing monsters, and running all over the place. The only sleep he\u2019d had were mere quick naps to recover from fatigue.But when he sat back and looked back, he realized how intensely he had kept to his schedule. It felt as if he had entered the tutorial just yesterday And now that he was relaxing, he felt a little bit tired. Though not physically tired, mental fatigue seemed to have piled up considerably.However, he tried to not let his guard down. His senses were relentlessly scanning through the area in great detail. He dismissed all the distracting thoughts from his head.*Rustle*He watched the serene night sky and enjoyed the night breeze. This alone seemed to relieve his mental fatigue and pressure that had been building up till now.\u2018This reminds me of the sky in Africa.\u2019Yeon-woo recalled his comrades and the commander who would be working hard in his place by now. He felt a little sorry when he thought about the commander who had cared for him like a father.\u2018Jeong-woo would have loved this kind of silent atmosphere.\u2019Then Yeon-woo shifted his gaze towards Kahn and Doyle. Apparently, they were so tired that they fell asleep as soon as they laid their head down.\u2018What an interesting duo.\u2019It appeared to Yeon-woo that Kahn and Doyle were very different from other ordinary players. Their faces were always beaming with joy. At the same time, they behaved in a confident manner.These two had a type of \u2018bearing\u2019 that other players lacked. They dealt with these situations as if they were already too familiar with them.\u2018Where on earth did you guys spring out from?\u2019On their way to the swamp, Yeon-woo could finally check their skills. Kahn occasionally revealed a glimpse of his excelent swordsmanship. It was powerful, sharp, and fierce. It seemed to strike a balance between magnificence and practicality. That level of swordsmanship could never be attained in just a few days. Yeon-woo was sure he must have gone through many experiences and training. Although he was talkative and foolish on the outside, he must have had no ordinary childhood.So was Doyle. He always had dull and sleepy eyes, but he sometimes he would show a sharp look. And when he did, he displayed keen judgement and critical acumen. If Kahn was a doer that mostly engaged in close combat, Doyle was more of a thinker that stayed at the backline and made the decisions.In particular, Doyle\u2019s entomopathic ability might seem weak whenever he uses it for practical use, but its true power shone brightly when it was used against monsters.The bugs he controlled were very small. What if they crept into the orifices like the nose, ears, and mouth? What if they dug into the skins, nibbled off the blood vessels, and tore up the muscles? So monsters instinctively avoided clashing against Doyle and chose to rush towards Kahn instead. Whenever that happened, Kahn got upset at the flocking monsters and they still ended up being swept away.The teamwork that the duo showed, like two cogwheels that meshed perfectly together, was nothing short of impressive. It didn\u2019t look like they had learned or practiced beforehand, but they had developed a certain kind of connection that instinctively told them what would be the other one\u2019s next course of action. This must be the result of working together for not just a day or two, but for at least five or ten years.\u00a0\u00a0 Even real siblings wouldn\u2019t be in perfect sync like them.\u2018What is your relationship? I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not brothers.\u2019He didn\u2019t know how experts like them, who also seemed to come from a privileged background, were so close to each other, and why did they have to make things harder for themselves.But there was one thing for sure.\u2018They sure look good together.\u2019The two of them were so willing to trust each other with their own lives. This relationship could never happen without mutual faith.Yeon-woo was a little jealous of the relationship between the two. Of course, it wasn\u2019t like he wanted to get to know them in detail, or to join in their relationship.Just by looking at these two, Yeon-woo couldn\u2019t help but see the reflection of a person he used to know.\u201c\u2026.\u201dYeon-woo thought he was becoming needlessly sentimental as the night wore on.He was trying to get rid of all the idle thoughts from his head. He couldn\u2019t believe he had so many miscellaneous thoughts.But to his surprise,\u2018Is it because of this short break I took?\u2019His mind was now clearer than ever. Just like the sky after a heavy rain.When he opened his closed eyes again, they were filled with whole-souled determination.Then suddenly, Kahn rustled and woke up from his sleep. His eyes shown through his wild hair still looked very sleepy. He even gave a big yawn.\u201cWhy did you get up? You still have some time before your turn.\u201d\u201cHow can I sleep if it\u2019s so noisy around here?\u201dA chuckle slipped out of Yeon-woo\u2019s mouth.Contrary to Kahn\u2019s statement, their surroundings were rather too calm. As if someone had intentionally muted all the sound. The cry of the bugs, the whistle of the wind. No sound could be heard.Kahn rubbed his sleepy eyes and took his hand to the scabbard he had left near his head.Still, everything was all too quiet.Before he knew it, Doyle had also gotten up with a yawn. He put a slight frown upon his fine face, looking annoyed at the things that disturbed his sleep.\u201cHaaam! How long are you going to let them be like that?\u201d\u201cI was going to get rid of them when they came closer. I\u2019m sorry to let them wake you up.\u201dDoyle answered Yeon-woo with a grin on his face.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I was getting stiff since I haven\u2019t been moving my body lately. Might as well do some proper exercise.\u201dAt the same time, Doyle turned around to look at Kahn.\u201cHyung. I was wondering myself.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cDo you think they knew you were here?\u201d\u201cDoes that matter?\u201dKahn slowly drew his sword out of the scabbard while his eyes give off cold glow.\u201cWhat matters is that they are enemies who are pointing their swords at us.\u201dAs soon as Kahn finished his words,*Pat*His shadow suddenly disappeared.*Spurt*\u201cAaaak!\u201dWith the sound of blood splashing, a desperate scream came out from the bush.\u201cDammit! How did they notice we were here?\u201d\u201cFan out! It\u2019s more dangerous if we bunch up!\u201dSoon, something stirred from within the bushes and several players came out from them, all busily moving in different directions.They were originally planning on approaching as close as possible and jumping at their targets all at once. But once they were caught, there was no advantage in making an ambush anymore. Rather, it was more dangerous for them if they were grouped up. They were currently facing none other than the Blood Sword and Foxy Tail. There was no chance of winning if they fought them directly.Kahn bolted around and brandished his sword, as if he didn\u2019t even have the slightest intention of letting them slip away. With each slash, blood sprayed over the grass and a body fell to the ground.Doyle also made a big gesture in the air.*Buzz*The forest was a home of many bugs and flies. Several swarms of bugs formed at places and they each rushed towards the nearest players.\u201cDamn it! Fucking insects!\u201d\u201cGet it off! Get it oooff!\u201dAs thousands of bugs clung to their skin, they swung their swords trying to shake them off. But the bugs kept digging deeper into their skin and feasted on their flesh.Painful screams echoed around the whole forest.Even though Kahn and Doyle had been slaughtering enemies at an inhuman pace, there were still numerous players hiding in the bushes.*Rustle*Doyle heard a muffled sound of stealthy footsteps from behind. It seemed like they were aiming to attack from the blind spot.With a slightly irritated face, Doyle was about to send bugs to them but,\u201cHmm?\u201dWhen he realized where they were going, he was so taken aback that a small laugh came out of his mouth.They were moving towards Yeon-woo.They might have targeted Yeon-woo because unlike them, his name wasn\u2019t well known. Maybe they thought Yeon-woo was a porter of some sort.But whatever the case was,Could they have been expecting this?The place that they are heading now,\u2018Those idiots. Of all choices they could have made, they still managed to choose the worst.\u2019Was actually the jaws of death.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Deal (3)*Rustle*\u2018Fuck! They noticed us too soon. I\u2019ll have to steal this guy\u2019s Tokens while Blood Sword and Foxy Tail are distracted. And his artifacts too, if I can.\u2019Franc and his minions were among the most active scavengers in Section E.They were very fond of their job. Under the guise of taking Tokens, they robbed players\u2019 riches, artifacts and everything else. Artifacts were divided amongst themselves to greatly increase their battle prowess. If they were lucky enough, they could even obtain some skill books. Tokens could be sold to top rankers at very high prices.Also, there were several places that were in need of live players. Varying from workers or slaves, to prostitutes, livestock, and even human specimens for experimental purposes. People had a variety of uses for their bodies, so they didn\u2019t have to worry about where to sell them. Who wouldn\u2019t want a piece of such a lucrative business?What was better was that this guy was the teammate of top rankers like Kahn and Doyle. No one knew how many Tokens he might be carrying or what artifacts he might have received from those two.Although there was the risk of having to sneak behind Kahn and Doyle, he was expecting to get a great deal of return from it. He was so nervous that his mouth was drying up. And as expected, Kahn and Doyle hadn\u2019t noticed their ambush. Their prey was so frightened that he was only crouching by the fire, unaware of his imminent fate.*Pat*Not long before Franc and his minions jumped out from bushes and slashed at the back of the man wearing a white mask.\u2018It\u2019s in!\u2019, Franc thought to himself.But soon he noticed something was wrong and opened his eyes wide. Just like an illusion, there was nothing in the place where his sword had slashed.Instinct told him to look up, and there he saw the white mask. It then landed right in front of him. Behind the white mask, two eyes were flashing like a will-o\u2019-wisp.\u201c\u2026!\u201dA terrible chill ran through his body.*Spurt*From his head to his groin, a dagger carved a dark red line along Franc\u2019s body, knocking him over to his back.\u201cwh, what the hell?\u201d\u201cB, bo, boss!\u201dThe rest of the scavengers behind Franc faltered for a moment.In the meantime, Yeon-woo turned around and threw himself at them.*Swish*The figure gliding through the forest under the dark sky reminded them of a ghost. It looked like a white mask floating amid the darkness. That image caused the scavengers to shiver in fear.What was supposed to be a prey, turned out to be a predator that killed Franc with one slash. And the sheer look of his glowing eyes made their flesh crawl.*Tang*One of the scavengers at the front managed to fend off Yeon-woo\u2019s attack. Then the atmosphere suddenly changed.Wait, maybe he isn\u2019t that tough! Maybe Franc\u2019s carelessness let this guy get the better of him. We are superior in number, so it can\u2019t be that hard to kill just one guy if we attack all at once, right?All the scavengers thought of the same thought, jumped to the same conclusion, and they all rushed towards Yeon-woo in unison.*Swish*\u201cYou son of a bitch!\u201d\u201cDie, you motherfucker!\u201dBut of course, that was Yeon-woo\u2019s trap to draw them in.With his dagger interlocked with the enemy\u2019s weapon, Yeon-woo quickly spun to his right and darted right beneath the scavenger in front of him. At the same time, he drew another dagger with his left hand holding it in reverse and immediately sliced him right in the neck.*Spurt*Blood sprayed upward like a fountain as the dagger severed his jugular vein. Yeon-woo then threw the dagger in between the fountain of blood, piercing another scavenger\u2019s head. Soon after, he ran straight back to the three scavengers sneaking behind, and swiftly cut their waist, neck, and shoulder.\u201cH, how the hell\u2026. *Gurgle*\u201d\u201cFuck!\u201dThe scavengers then realized it was all a trap and wanted to retreat. But it was too late now, so they still tried to pressure and exhaust Yeon-woo by relying on their numbers.Contrary to their wish, Yeon-woo went on a rampage destroying each and every one of them. He parried a knife that flew towards him and stabbed into their neck, waist, and heart. He blocked a spear aiming at his blind spot with his arm, snapped it into half, and cut off the head of its wielder.Yeon-woo\u2019s inhuman movement made them think he had eyes all over his body. Every time the scavengers attacked Yeon-woo, he dodged all of their attacks and even launched counterattacks. And each time, the scavengers collapsed with their blood scattering all over the grass.They felt as if they had been possessed by a ghost.\u201cR, run!\u201dThey finally realized they had messed with the wrong guy and tried to make an escape.*Swish**Puck*Yeon-woo threw a dagger towards the head of the first one to run away, and then quickly chased after the others. His speed was too fast and direction unpredictable, so they could do nothing but to hopelessly await their deaths. Fear had grabbed their ankles. Terror was slowly eating them up from the inside.* \u00a0\u00a0 * \u00a0\u00a0 *The three of them had killed a total of 21 scavengers. It was more than he had expected.Kahn asked Yeon-woo all of a sudden.\u201cWhy did you let them come near?\u201d\u201cThe more Tokens, the better.\u201d\u201cMan, you are seriously out of your mind.\u201dKahn clicked his tongue lightly.He was saying that from the very beginning he had planned to lure them in in order to kill them all in the same spot.Of course, there were also other players in Section E who used a similar strategy to Yeon-woo. These players specifically hunted down the scavengers by disguising themselves as lone stragglers. But even so, it was only possible when facing against small numbers. No one wanted to face over 20 scavengers moving together in an organized system. Even high rankers couldn\u2019t handle such overwhelming numbers of enemies. But Yeon-woo treated such things as nothing at all.Was it because he had trust in Kahn and Doyle, or because he was confident in his own skills?.\u2018Or maybe it\u2019s both.\u2019Meanwhile, Yeon-woo had been looting Tokens from the scavengers\u2019 bodies.\u201c81? Seems like they\u2019ve been in this business for quite a long time.\u201dYeon-woo was dumbfounded by the number of Tokens he had found in the scavengers corpses. He had only found five Tokens while searching around the forest with his senses strengthened. But they were carrying almost a hundred with them.Even with that number, the underlings only carried one or two, most of them were found on the ones who looked like the leaders.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since new players had entered Section E. That\u2019s probably what was leftover after selling most of them. More than a thousand people had been in this place, looking for Tokens and fighting for them. 81 is a small number compared to that.\u201dDoyle provided an explanation with a smile on his face.\u201cBut that\u2019s only possible because they were scavengers. Most players probably have 10 Tokens or less.\u201d\u201cThe rich get richer, the poor get poorer.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201dYeon-woo thought it made sense.Section E had a type of a \u2018winner-takes-all\u2019 system. The strong player minority would take Tokens from the weak player majority. Weak players had no choice but to give up their Tokens to survive. Even if they made up for the loss, eventually they would get stolen again.\u2018They might even be enslaved and made to hand in the Tokens they find.\u2019Whatever they may do, the strong can sit still and pile up Tokens at a rapid pace. On the other hand, the weak would be always short on Tokens. That was the reason why there was a huge gap between high rankers and the other players.Yeon-woo also knew about this system and was waiting for the scavengers to come.\u201cAnyway, collect as many Tokens as you can. They\u2019ll be used to gain Karma, as well as to purchase items from the mysterious merchant. The top-ranked players usually don\u2019t go straight to Section F even if they have the 99 Tokens required. They will try to hoard as many as they can.\u201dYeon-woo nodded along.\u2018Come to think of it, was it at the end of Section E where I can meet the mysterious merchant again?\u2019Yeon-woo recalled his brother\u2019s diary. He didn\u2019t think much of it because he didn\u2019t have anything to buy from the mysterious merchant. But it wouldn\u2019t harm to keep it in mind.\u201cOh, by the way, you can have all the Tokens.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dYeon-woo looked back at Doyle at the unexpected remark. 81 Tokens were quite a lot to just give away. He didn\u2019t understand why.Doyle smiled and said,\u201cWe didn\u2019t pay you front money when we made the deal, did we? Think of it as a down payment.\u201d\u201cWhat about Kahn?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s really simple, you know. He\u2019ll do whatever I ask him to, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cYou two also need Karma.\u201d\u201cHaha! Are you worried about us? We surely have enough for ourselves, so really, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cWell then, thank you kindly.\u201dThere was no reason to turn down their favor. Yeon-woo put the Tokens inside a pouch he made from weaving the hide of the Trolls. He had too many Tokens so he didn\u2019t dare to swallow them anymore.\u2018This is easier than expected.\u2019Yeon-woo couldn\u2019t get rid of the idea that it was too easy.If he tried a little harder, he could move on to Section F. Of course, he wasn\u2019t going to actually do that. There was nothing major in Section F that would allow him to gather much Karma. Section E was virtually the last place he could collect Karma in large quantities.What\u2019s more,\u2018That guy will show up here too.\u2019The one that Yeon-woo had in his mind even before he entered the tutorial. The one that only appeared at this specific time period. He had to kill it before going to the next section.\u2018That will significantly increase my Magic Power. Then, I will be able to complete the succession process.\u2019If it was a solid vessel that Yeon-woo had acquired in Section B, what was left to be obtained in Section E was the content to fill up the vessel.Yeon-woo licked his lower lip.\u2018Once we kill the Lizardman King, I\u2019ll have to head straight to kill \u2018that guy\u2019.\u2019He already had his plan mapped out in his mind.* \u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *The following day.Yeon-woo\u2019s party was able to reach their destination, the northern swamp.It was very hard to move their feet as the swamp was full of soft mud. Their feet sank deep into the swamp with every step they took, and it was getting deeper as they moved inward. At some point, they had to climb up a tree and jump from tree to tree to move around. During the meantime, they had several fights whenever they came across a Lizardman settlement.Lizardmen are reptilian monsters with the ability to walk upright. These monsters have knowledge of wielding swords and possess high intelligence, they even know how to \u2018hunt\u2019.They would attack with a hit-and-run style in order the exhaust the intruders as much as possible, before launching a final attack where they\u2019d usually all jump in at once.However, it did not work against Yeon-woo\u2019s party at all. They showed no signs of fatigue even after a series of battles. They just wiped out every single Lizardman they saw. And Yeon-woo even looted materials from the monsters\u2019 carcasses.\u201c\u2026What else are you going to take this time?\u201d\u201cTheir eyes. Lizardmen\u2019s Eyeballs are a very useful item for making artifacts with certain buffs.\u201d\u201cYeah. Of course. Well, there are bodies lying everywhere around here, so go ahead. Help yourself.\u201dKahn shook his head in disgust, and once Yeon-woo started to cut off the spikes on their tails, he no longer spoke a word.\u2018I need their eyes to forge the artifact, Gyges\u2019 Eyes\u2019.It was an artifact named after a giant that\u2019s said to have hundreds of arms and thousands of eyes.Yeon-woo swore to himself that he would get his hands on that artifact one day, and continued to move on.Meanwhile, thanks to his steady search, he now had 89 Tokens in his possession.And only after destroying a couple of settlements, they were finally able to reach Hargan\u2019s Lair.However,\u201cWait, is this\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah. Looks like they already had some guests.\u201dDoyle looked at Kahn with a worried look.Kahn nodded gravely.Yeon-woo also narrowed his brows.There were bloodstains and other traces of battle along the way leading to Hargan\u2019s Lair.They were traces of other players.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Deal (4)\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been long since the battle took place.\u201dYeon-woo leaned down and touched the bloodstained soil with his hands. He also checked the traces left on trees and rocks. Anyone could tell he knew what he was doing.\u201cFive hours? No, it was about six hours ago.\u201d\u201cSix hours\u2026.\u201d Kahn muttered in a small voice.Doyle asked Yeon-woo with a worried look.\u201cThese people, did they succeed?\u201dHidden pieces were supposed to be literally \u2018hidden\u2019. They were valuable only when kept hidden. They played a role in raising players\u2019 morale and encouraging them to stay focused without falling behind. So hidden pieces in the tutorial never occurred again in the same round once they were cleared.Then what would happen if the other players had already cleared Hargan\u2019s Lair? For Kahn and Doyle who needed Hargan\u2019s Crown, it would be a tremendous loss.Also, even though Kahn and Doyle hadn\u2019t told Yeon-woo yet, it wasn\u2019t just the crown that they needed. There was something else they wanted to obtain using the crown. It was an essential element for the two who were plotting something big. Therefore, the interference of other players wasn\u2019t good news.But Yeon-woo stood up, he further examined the traces and gave them a reassuring answer.\u201cNo. There are only traces leading inside, but there are no signs of people coming out. And apparently the people who came here didn\u2019t come in search of Hargan\u2019s Lair.\u201d\u201cWhat? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cLook here.\u201dYeon-woo pointed towards a deep trench on the ground.\u201cIt\u2019s a trail of something heavy being dragged through the ground. That must be the players\u2019 bodies. I think the Lizardmen used some kind of bait and lured them here.\u201d\u201cAnd then?\u201d\u201cNobody knows.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dKahn and Doyle couldn\u2019t help but frown. Although Yeon-woo hadn\u2019t said anything, they could imagine what had happened to them.Monsters weren\u2019t always the prey. There were times when monsters themselves became the hunters and preyed on players. For them, this place was their home. They knew the local geography better than players, of course there would be traps lying around. Yeon-woo presumed this had something to do with those traps.\u201cGod damn sons of bitches!\u201dFortunately for Yeon-woo, Kahn only spat out some curses and didn\u2019t seem to want to intervene in this matter.\u2018I thought he was just naive, but he can keep his cool when necessary.\u2019Yeon-woo nodded quietly.If Kahn had lost his judgment out of simple emotions, Yeon-woo had planned to return the Tokens and just leave. But Kahn must have been acting calm to set an example as Doyle\u2019s senior.Then Yeon-woo noticed that Doyle, who usually had good control over his feelings, had a grim expression on his face.Doyle noticed Yeon-woo\u2019s gaze and put on his usual smile. He looked at Yeon-woo and raised his brows as if asking if there was something wrong with him.Yeon-woo knitted his eyebrows, but soon shook his head. He remained silent.Just then, \u201cIt is really irritating to just let it go, but we can\u2019t afford to overexert ourselves. So, Cain.\u201dYeon-woo turned his head as he heard his codename.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWe haven\u2019t told you anything about this place yet, have we?\u201dYeon-woo quietly nodded his head. Up till now, he had been pretending not to know, so now he had to keep pretending. Besides, he wanted to know how much they knew about Hargan\u2019s Lair and what kind of plan they had in mind.Kahn continued with a serious look.\u201cThis place is called Hargan\u2019s Lair.\u201d\u201cLair?\u201d\u201cYes. You remember the Lizardmen we\u2019ve been dealing with on our way here, right? Hargan is a\u2026 leader? Chief among all chiefs? A king? Well, he is something like that. And this is where he is.\u201d\u201cSounds like he\u2019s strong.\u201d\u201cYeah, definitely. Us two together probably can\u2019t kill him either.\u201dA dungeon with a boss monster that the 3rd and 11th rankers could not kill.Yeon-woo then asked a question.\u201cEven with me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 a different story, but it\u2019s still gonna be tough. There\u2019s also a female one inside the lair. That one\u2019s the real deal.\u201dAs expected, Kahn and Doyle seemed to have accurate information about Hargan\u2019s Lair.\u201cThere\u2019s one thing for sure. No matter how hard we try, the three of us can\u2019t kill both bosses. We\u2019ll die in vain.\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s our plan?\u201d\u201cTheft.\u201d\u201cTheft?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dKahn nodded with a serious look.\u201cThe male one is outside the lair and the female one is inside. While I deal with the male one, you will have to distract the female one. Then Doyle will take the crown from her head.\u201d\u201cAnd then?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll make a run for it!\u201dKahn snickered as if Yeon-woo was asking something obvious.\u201cAs I said, the female one is ridiculously strong. You cannot kill her on your own. So don\u2019t you ever fight her head-on, you just have to get her aggro.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dYeon-woo gave him a nod.Kahn stared at Yeon-woo in surprise.\u201cHow are you taking this so calmly?\u201d\u201cThat was our deal, wasn\u2019t it?\u201dKahn\u2019s face turned red as he scratched his cheek.\u201cWell, you know, I\u2019m telling you to take the hardest role in our plan. I thought you\u2019d say you want to take the male one.\u201d\u201cI know you\u2019re afraid that I might run away if things go wrong. Don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t make promises I can\u2019t keep. But if we are planning on running away, I must ask you something else in return for our deal.\u201dKahn smiled broadly.\u201cYou bet we will! Man, I\u2019m such a good judge of character. I knew you\u2019d figure out your job and help us!\u201dYeon-woo still found him bothersome and let out a snort with his arms crossed.Yeon-woo had been executing his duties in the battlefield of Africa This was nothing different from that. The only difference was that he used to be a soldier who was simply driven by orders from his superiors, but now he was more like a mercenary who was driven by money.\u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201dKahn drew his sword from his waist.*Schwing*The sunlight reflected on the blade produced an ominous red gloss.* \u00a0\u00a0 * \u00a0\u00a0 *Yeon-woo\u2019s party moved forward while maintaining an arrowhead formation with Kahn at the front.Soon after,[You have entered a field][You have found the hidden piece, \u2018Hargan\u2019s Lair\u2019.][You have acquired 500 Karma.]*Rustle*As a bush stirred, a Lizardman patrolling the lair suddenly shouted out loud.\u201cHsss! Humans! There are humans here!\u201dFrom then on, Yeon-woo\u2019s party started running through the field.Hargan was the king of the Lizardmen. Of course, if there was a king, there also had to be lots and lots of royal guards protecting their king. Every single one of the Lizardmen gathered in this place were among the greatest warriors their species had to offer. The Lizardmen that were standing in front of their party could not be compared to the ones they had met on their way here.*Clang**Clang*As they traversed through a horde of Lizardmen, The male Lizardman King, Hargan, made his appearance and let out a deafening roar.\u201cKaaak! Humans! You dare enter my lair? You must die!\u201dThe average Lizardman was about two meters tall, but Hargan was about twice as big. His scales glimmered blue, and his scimitar was drenched in blood. His monstrous roar exuded an overwhelming aura.[A hidden boss monster, Hargan the Lizardman King has emerged.][Hidden Quest / The King of Lizardmen]Content: In Section E, there are five kings that rule over the forest. Hargan is the king of the Lizardman, who owns the northern swamp.Defeat all his guards and slay Hargan the Lizardman King.Rewards: Hargan\u2019s Crown, Blue Scale Scimitar, ownership of the lair.Krwarwa!\u2018What a monster it is.\u2019Yeon-woo frowned at Hargan, who greatly affected his senses simply by spreading out his presence.The quest window also showed up, but he didn\u2019t pay any attention to it.Kwaaa\u2018He is gigantic.\u2019He had never experienced such enormous pressure. He hadn\u2019t felt like this even when he had first entered the tutorial. It was close to the fear he had felt when he was brought to the battlefield in Africa for the first time. The boiling tension made his right hand holding the dagger to be soaked in sweat.There was a fair amount of distance between Yeon-woo and Hargan, but to him, it felt certainly very close.Because we stumbled upon this lair by pure coincidence, we were so nervous when we first faced Hargan. Some of our teammates even shrank back in horror.The feeling of pressure Hargan gave us was that huge.In front of him, we felt like we were small and insignificant beings. My blood ran cold. I clenched my teeth in an attempt to repel the fear, but it wasn\u2019t enough to stop my legs from trembling.Yeon-woo could now understand what his brother had experienced.Even if he had broken through in succession all the way up to Section E, he had never seen such a strong monster that gave off this kind of \u2018different feeling\u2019.A strong murderous intent that aroused his instinct was as frightening as it could be. However,\u2018I\u2019ve had enough of this already.\u2019Yeon-woo put more strength into his eyes and managed to stay composed.Suddenly, the spirit surrounding Yeon-woo started to push away Hargan\u2019s pressure.*Whoosh*\u201c\u2026!\u201dHargan stopped in the middle of his roar. His face quickly stiffened. His eyes were fixed on Yeon-woo. His instincts were telling him something. Out of all the players he had met, the guy with the white mask was a \u2018true\u2019 warrior who must have honed his murderous aura while wandering around many battlefields.\u201cI will kill you, human!\u201dHargan tightened his grip on the scimitar and jumped at Yeon-woo.As the body well over two meters in size rushed towards him like a mad bull, Yeon-woo felt the murderous intent blowing across the lair like a windstorm.Because he was running so fast, some of the Lizardmen in front of him were kicked out of his way. However, Yeon-woo who had honed his aura throughout the course of many wars didn\u2019t back out.At that moment, Kahn jumped forward.*Swish**Tang*Kahn\u2019s sword struck Hargan\u2019s scimitar. The clash created sparks along with a fierce mana storm.Hargan\u2019s face was completely distorted.\u201cHuman, get out of my way! You are no match for me!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not who I used to be.\u201dKahn put on a cold grin and pulled his scimitar back. He had a record of fleeing from Hargan, so he was already familiar with his combat pattern.Hargan\u2019s enormous frame slightly tilted, then he backed away. Then his face distorted even more, and he swung his scimitar with all his strength in order to kill Kahn.However, Kahn\u2019s current attribute points were higher than when he had first fought Hargan. He wasn\u2019t going to lose so easily like last time.They collided once more.*Kung*Kahn was pushed back by the impact. A column of steam was rising from his tensed up muscles, and his eyes were bloodshot. A stuffy smell was leaking from his mouth. But for some reason, Kahn couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter.Hargan was still too strong, but it didn\u2019t feel as hopeless as before. An obscure desire to keep on fighting with Hargan arose from within him. But Kahn tried to suppress the desire. This was not the time to indulge himself. He had to make enough time for Yeon-woo and Doyle to break through the lair\u2019s entrance.Hargan then dashed towards him, but this time Kahn just stepped aside. Hargan, now with his lid flipped, turned around and tried to grab him.\u201cStop running away and face me!\u201dEven though Hargan possessed high intelligence, a monster was just a monster after all.Kahn kept narrowly dodging his attacks and lured him towards the pack of Lizardmen. Every time Hargan launched an attack, three to four Lizardmen ended up being sliced by his scimitar.The royal guards begged their king to calm down, but Kahn used a hit-and-run tactic to keep his aggro on him. Outside the lair was becoming more and more chaotic.In the meantime, Yeon-woo and Doyle were able to get inside the lair by taking advantage of the confusion.* \u00a0\u00a0 * \u00a0\u00a0 *There were other guards throughout the passage of the lair. However, their foreheads were pierced by Yeon-woo\u2019s dagger as soon as they appeared.On the way to their destination, the two hadn\u2019t spoken a word. Doyle might have been worried about Kahn, but he kept his focus on his current duty and held his mouth closed. He was fully aware of the fact that the chances of Kahn\u2019s survival depended on how fast he could steal the crown.Soon after, they were able to reach the deepest area of the lair, the queen\u2019s room.What Yeon-woo and Doyle witnessed there was,\u201cIt, it, it\u2019s a person!\u201d\u201cSave me! P, please!\u201d\u201cH, he\u2026 help!\u201dLimbs that had been pulled out from their bodies, heads left with expressions that showed the excruciating pain they had gone through, and bits of flesh and stains of blood scattered all over the place. It was an absolutely disastrous scene.And there were other people tied up in chains and locked up in cages like livestock.This place was a human farm.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(6)Yeon-woo\u2019s expression sank deeply as he recalled the traces of players he had found earlier at the entrance. This was the end players must have met after being captured by the monsters. This place was used to keep humans trapped like livestock.Although it wasn\u2019t revealed because he was wearing a mask, he himself was also seething with anger.The hidden piece, \u2018Hargan\u2019s Lair\u2019 is literally the lair of the Lizard King, Hargan, and the Queen, Taragan. It\u2019s their home. At this point in time, they are rigidly keeping watch to protect their newborn babies. Plus, in order to feed their babies, they would often hunt players and bring them over to their lair.These scattered body parts in front of Yeon-woo were the scraps left after their predation. In other words, this place was used as storage to keep their food and have it prepared for their children.\u2018Be it in Earth or here, at the end of the day it\u2019s all the same.\u2019Similar scenes were often seen when he was serving in the military in the past. Scenes of the weak being kidnapped and made into slaves. Kids were brainwashed and made to shoot rifles, the elderly were forced to become suicide bombers, women were taken as sexual slaves, and many more tragic scenes could be seen during his missions.The situation here was not much different from that. The only difference was that the victims here weren\u2019t treated as slaves but as livestock or food, and that the perpetrators were Lizardmen, not humans. There was no difference at its core. No, maybe this wasn\u2019t even part of the Lizardmen\u2019s customs.\u2018Between people\u2019s treatment towards pigs and cows and their treatment towards people, was there any difference?\u2019The people were yelling for help, but if looked from another angle, they were just like cows tearing up before being dragged into a slaughterhouse.Yeon-woo calmly sorted out the situation.\u2018If we waste our time rescuing them, we won\u2019t have enough time to take the crown from the female.\u2019Most importantly, the players here had brought this crisis to themselves.The strong survive and the weak perish. This was common sense in The Tower. Those people had failed to realize their limits and participated in the trials in hope of becoming gods. Their actions were merely a thoughtless act of bravado.\u201cThe queen could show up anytime soon. I\u2019ll go find her so you should go hide yourself.\u201dBut when Yeon-woo took a glimpse at Doyle, he noticed Doyle was standing rooted to the spot. Yeon-woo then completely turned around expecting the worst.As far as he was concerned, Doyle had always been reasonable and he knew how to restrain himself, except for that one moment when he saw the traces of players being attacked. And sure enough, his expression was now stiff and his clenched fist was quivering with anger.\u201cDon\u2019t you\u2026 get angry?\u201dHis teary eyes looked at Yeon-woo.\u201cAngry?\u201d\u201cYes, angry. How can you be so calm after seeing this?\u201dYeon-woo was a little disappointed. Doyle was just a kid after all.\u201cI am also a person. One wouldn\u2019t be a person if they didn\u2019t get mad at this.\u201d\u201cThen why are you\u2026!\u201d\u201cBut if we save them, Kahn will be in danger.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dDoyle was left in shock.Yeon-woo turned on his heel.\u201cDon\u2019t forget. Kahn is still fighting with Hargan at this very moment. He can\u2019t deal with Hargan alone, and the longer we stay here, the more dangerous it gets.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cPull yourself together and think about your priorities. But if you still want to act at your own discretion, I will be putting myself out of this business. You two can die for all I care.\u201dDoyle bit his lower lip. His eyes were shaking due to his continuous inner conflicts.Yeon-woo squinted at Doyle. In his eyes, Doyle\u2019s agonized look overlapped with the image of his comrades back in the military.\u2018Does he have a trauma? It must be PTSD.\u2019Post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD for short. It is a mental health problem that can occur after witnessing or experiencing a traumatic event.Something from his past must be triggering his emotions. But Yeon-woo didn\u2019t know what Doyle had been through. What he could tell, was that he had experienced something similar to this in the past and that he was being hindered by that exact memory.\u201c\u2026.\u201dAfter a short silence.*Slap*Doyle slapped himself hard on the cheek with both hands, leaving a couple of red handprints on his pure white skin. His once furious looking eyes were now filled with determination, as if he had made a firm resolve in his mind.Doyle soon looked up at Yeon-woo and apologized.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was being thoughtless.\u201dYeon-woo realized that Doyle had suppressed his trauma and managed to prioritize Kahn. Perhaps this would have a great impact on him, widening his view of the world in the future.\u201cLet\u2019s get back to work. Kahn is still waiting for us outside.\u201dWhen Doyle was about to move on,\u2018Wait a second.\u2019Yeon-woo had another great idea. The reason why Hargan made this human farm was to feed their children. Then, they could also use that to their advantage.\u201cHold still.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve just come up with a good idea. Can I modify our plan a little bit? If it goes well, we can also save the people here.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dDoyle opened his eyes wide. Even though he had chosen Kahn as his top priority, a part of him was still holding onto hope, and to his surprise, Yeon-woo was talking about a plan to save them all.Doyle\u2019s eyes glistened with curiosity.\u201cI need you to summon the flamebugs you showed me last night.\u201dUnder the mask Yeon-woo let out a cold laugh.* * *Queen Taragan unleashed her boiling anger.\u201cHumans! How dare humans enter my lair!\u201dShe swung her club and crushed the head of a Lizardman in front of her. The royal guard who had only come to report was killed all of a sudden, but the other guards didn\u2019t try to stop Taragan.Even Hargan couldn\u2019t do anything when she became hysterical. In times like this, they knew they had to leave her alone to avoid further damage.\u201cMy babies! They must have come after my babies!\u201dTaragan had laid fourteen eggs in total. From those, three of them weren\u2019t able to break out of their shells, and another three were eaten by other monsters outside the lair. Again, another three suffered from an unknown disease and eventually slowly met their deaths.For this reason, the five remaining hatchlings were so special to the couple, that the lair had to be kept safe from any threat no matter the cost. But right now, she was told that humans came into their lair. Not as the food tied in chains, but as intruders holding swords.They were the ones that had fled before.Taragan raised herself with the blood dripping club on her hand.\u201cYou! You! You! Protect my babies! Even if you die, protect my babies!\u201dHer obsession towards her hatchlings made her believe that the humans would go after them. If so, she, who was stronger than her husband, had to step up and fend off the intruders.The guards also knew about her obsession, so they positively answered. They knew that if her babies suffered the smallest wound, their heads would be the next ones to be crushed.*Kung* *Kung*Every time her three-meter-tall body moved, the floor shook violently.Just then, a figure suddenly appeared in front of Taragan. Blazing eyes underneath a white mask. It was Yeon-woo, he was holding a leather pouch with unknown contents in his right hand.\u201cHuman! I will kill you!\u201dTaragan roared at the human who dared to fearlessly show himself. Her ferocious roar rang throughout the entire lair. But Yeon-woo spoke to her with a smile on his face.\u201cHey, Lizard Queen.\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d\u201cDo you like fireworks?\u201d\u201cWhat are you\u2026!\u201dWhen she was about to stomp on Yeon-woo and his nonsense, Yeon-woo suddenly threw the leather pouch into the room where the hatchlings were.Taragan felt a sense of crisis, quickly swung her club and burst the pouch in midair. With a pop, the red powder came out of the pouch and spread like fog, obscuring Taragan\u2019s sight. It was the powder made from the monsters he had endlessly hunted in the Room of Frost and Flames.\u201cDoyle!\u201dOn Yeon-woo\u2019s signal, Doyle, who was hiding in a corner, quickly commanded the flamebugs towards the powder.A wild explosion engulfed Taragan.*Kwang**Swish*Yeon-woo and Doyle then quickly ran into the room.\u201cKuaaah! You vermins!\u201dFrom the spot where the explosion had swept through, Taragan turned towards the room as she forcefully clove her way through the fire.One of her eyes was destroyed and her burnt skin was festering. She had serious injuries on the upper half of her body, but she couldn\u2019t just stand there crying in pain. Humans were after her babies. She had to go protect her babies. But when she rushed into the room, Yeon-woo and Doyle had already eliminated the guards and each one of them was holding a hatchling.Yeon-woo, in particular, raised the one he was holding to give her a better view of what was going to happen next. And with a cold smile, he sliced its neck with his dagger.*Spurt*\u201cAaaaack! Humaan! Hooow! How dare yooou!\u201dMadness took control over Taragan\u2019s mind. As she lost her reason, she charged towards Yeon-woo like a bull. The only thing left in her head was the thought of tearing Yeon-woo to death.*Rumble*\u201cIf you treated humans as livestock,\u201dBut Yeon-woo had already grabbed onto the rest of the hatchlings and started to back off.Once again, Yeon-woo shoved his dagger into the neck of one of the hatchlings that was struggling in his grip. A terrible scream echoed throughout the lair.\u201cYou should have been aware that it could happen to you too, right?\u201d\u201cLet go of that haaand! Humaaan!\u201dBut Yeon-woo\u2019s words never reached Taragan\u2019s ear. Her eyes were only fixed onto her dying babies as she chased after Yeon-woo.Yeon-woo carelessly threw the dead baby onto the floor, and the moment when Taragan jumped forward to catch her baby.*Kwang**Kwa-kwang*One of the booby traps they had installed immediately after entering the room was triggered, causing a massive explosion that could not be compared to the previous one.Then the explosion triggered another trap, and another one, producing an immense chain explosion. The ground was quaking, the trees were burning. The whole room was engulfed by a deluge of fire. Taragan was suffering excruciating pain inside the blazing inferno.\u201cKuaaaak! Human! Humaaan!\u201dIf Taragan were her normal self, she would have noticed the booby traps.Some parts of the booby traps weren\u2019t camouflaged well enough because they were made in a rush, however, Yeon-woo used Taragan\u2019s obsession for her babies to his advantage.No mother would stay sane after witnessing her child\u2019s death. Knowing this, Yeon-woo aimed at her very weakness, and Taragan could only helplessly fall for his traps.\u201cNoo! My babies! My little babies!\u201dTaragan somehow survived through the explosions. Even though she was suffering from burns all over her body, she was still anxiously looking for her hatchlings. But Yeon-woo and Doyle still had her three remaining babies in their hands.As they kept retreating, they killed her babies one by one while luring her to every single trap they had installed. By the time the last one died, Taragan was caught in the last remaining booby trap and her body collapsed onto the floor.*Kwang*Yeon-woo pushed his dagger deep into Taragan\u2019s throat and put an end to her life.\u201cBetween humans and monsters, it\u2019s only kill or be killed.\u201d[You have slain the boss monster, Taragan \u2013 the Lizardman Queen. Additional Karma will be provided.][You have acquired 500 Karma.][The Lizardmen have been demoralized. Monsters in Hargan\u2019s Lair enter a panicked state.]A flood of messages notifying him of Taragan\u2019s death popped up in front of Yeon-woo, and Yeon-woo was suddenly overcome with fatigue.\u2018That was the last bit of powder I had left from the Room of Frost and Flame\u2019Although it was the booby traps that did all the work, it still hadn\u2019t been easy to lure her in while keeping a proper distance from her. If he had made a mistake, or if Taragan had come to her senses, their plan would have been completely spoiled.\u2018It would have been impossible if Doyle hadn\u2019t ignited the flamebugs with precise timing.\u2019Considering he had come up with the plan on the spot, everything had worked out perfectly.\u201cHyung!\u201dThen Doyle came running and stood next to Yeon-woo. He looked like he couldn\u2019t believe they had just killed Taragan.Compared to what happened when he had tried to raid this dungeon with Kahn, this was an unbelievable success. He never would have thought that using a simple material from a dungeon that he must have found by luck could bring such an amazing result.The capacity to make judgement during combat, to come up with a plan, and the ability to execute it.Doyle looked at Yeon-woo with eyes filled with respect.Not caring about Doyle\u2019s gaze, Yeon-woo pointed towards the dead body with his chin.\u201cGo take the crown first. We have to hurry up and join with Kahn outside.\u201dDoyle answered with a nod and approached Taragan\u2019s corpse. She had been burned to death, in her bosom she was still holding her babies\u2019 dead bodies. It was certainly a tear-jerking display of maternal love.But Doyle\u2019s look was icy cold. Just like Yeon-woo had said, humans and monsters had to kill each other. And once again, he had been made painfully aware that this place was The Tower where the weak get eaten by the strong.Yeon-woo narrowed his eyes as he watched Doyle take the crown from Taragan\u2019s head.\u2018I\u2019ll have to come back after we\u2019re done with this business.\u2019Taragan\u2019s body had strong vitality even after her death. Although it was incomparable to extracting life energy from the living, if a corpse had some energy left in their body, Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword could still drain it. So if Yeon-woo could absorb her energy, it would be considerably beneficial towards improving his attribute points.\u2018I might be able to take her skill too.\u2019While Yeon-woo was looking at Taragan\u2019s body with a serious look, Doyle pulled out the crown and held it tight in his hand. His fists trembled with thrill.Yeon-woo turned to the direction where Kahn would be. If he and Doyle joined him, they might even be able to take down Hargan.Yeon-woo was thinking of looting Hargan\u2019s body, not to mention earning the Karma points.* * *Suddenly,\u201cKwuuung! Taragan! Taragan!\u201dWith his thumping footsteps, Hargan popped out from the corner of the passage. His face was all twisted as if he had come running at the sound of the explosion. Kahn came into the room right after him.He could tell that Kahn had a fierce battle outside just by his looks. He looked very exhausted.But Kahn quickly noticed what had happened as he took a quick look around the area filled with traces of explosions. He smiled to acknowledge a job well done and held tightly on to his sword once again. His exhausted body was reinvigorated.And,*Pat*He plucked up his courage and dashed towards Hargan.As if they had prearranged it, Yeon-woo and Doyle also moved at the same time.They had three people on their side. Even if they were a bit tired and had no more booby traps left, it was still enough to fight Hargan.*Whistle*It was at the moment when the three were about to reach Hargan who seemed to be preoccupied with Taragan\u2019s death that Yeon-woo noticed something strange. His senses suddenly began to warn him that the monster in front of him was dangerous.Then, he remembered one part from the diary.Hargan was much smaller and weaker than Taragan. But the reason he was able to become the leader of the Lizardman was because he had one unique skill.\u2026 and it was called \u2018Heat Wave(\u71b1\u98a8)\u2019.His brother and his team, Arthia, had to suffer through a lot of hardship during their raid due to this skill, Heat Wave.Streams of heated air emanated from his scimitar and hovered around Hargan\u2019s body. He was about to cast Heat Wave.\u201cGet away from him!\u201dYeon-woo quickly made a turn midrun. Kahn and Doyle, also sensing the danger, each turned in a right angle and ran far from Hargan\u2019s reach.Then Hargan struck the ground hard with his scimitar.*Kwang*The ground surrounding Hargan collapsed with an explosion and flames shot up from the ground at random. The sea of flame quickly engulfed the entire lair, eradicating what was left after the chain explosion.\u2018Shit!\u2019Yeon-woo quickly covered his face with his arms but was still pushed back by the gust of wind.Because the place was filled with so much heat, nothing could be felt within the area he scanned with his strengthened senses. He didn\u2019t even know where Kahn and Doyle were.*Whistle*After the heat had settled down, Yeon-woo could barely see the other side through the gap between his arms.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019The lair had completely collapsed. The world was full of red flames and black smoke. The scene was telling him how he had gotten the title of Lizardman King.What if he had been one step late and got caught up in that? He would be just ashes by now. That was how destructive it looked.Then, Yeon-woo witnessed with his own eyes.\u201cTaragan! I will get revenge on him! For you and our children!\u201dThe sight of Hargan holding the body of Taragan and his babies in his arms and crying out to the sky.*Chomp*And the sight of him biting into Taragan\u2019s neck without hesitation.It was cannibalism.He was trying to embrace the power of Taragan. It was something that wasn\u2019t written in the diary.[Boss Monster, Hargan (Lizardman King) has used \u2018Consume\u2019. Hargan has successfully stolen powers from Taragan (Lizardman Queen)][Mutation is in progress.][Second phase will begin.]*Rumble*Heat Wave once again raved through the lair, producing a massive earthquake.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Consume (1)*Crash*Like the ripples produced by a stone being thrown into a calm lake, waves of scorching wind were blowing away everything in their path. It was hard to even stand still.They would get scalded any moment soon if they kept themself exposed to this heat. Yeon-woo and Kahn quickly found rocks and tree stumps to hide behind. The heat was drying up the trees, setting them on fire and steam was rising up from the rocks.Doyle was also backing off as he hid behind a shield of flies.\u2018This is getting nuts.\u2019Yeon-woo put on a frown as he peeked at Hargan who was continuously releasing Heat Waves.He was eating Taragan\u2019s body in a reverent manner as if it were a sacred ritual.*Crunch* *Crack*With each bite, Hargan\u2019s body seemed to undergo noticeable changes. The intensity and the temperature of the Heat Waves was also rising.\u201cSecond phase?\u201dIt was an unexpected message.Yeon-woo frowned angrily. Multi-phase should be a pattern only present in strong boss monsters in the latter floors of The Tower. But right now, a mere boss monster from the tutorial was displaying such pattern. Was his resentment that big?At that moment, Yeon-woo noticed Kahn looking his way. He was asking him what was he going to do next. Their target, Hargan\u2019s Crown, was already in Doyle\u2019s hand, so they could just escape the dungeon, although even that wouldn\u2019t be easy to do.\u2018He\u2019ll follow us no matter where we go. Besides, it won\u2019t be easy to run away from him because of the Heat Waves.\u2019Desertification was rapidly spreading throughout Hargan\u2019s Lair, as well as the surrounding forest. The flying fire sparks landed on other pieces of parched wood, further spreading out the wildfire. In addition to that, the strong gusts of wind also impeded their escape.Kahn was also knitting his brows, perhaps he was thinking the same as Yeon-woo. He then looked at Yeon-woo asking if he had any plan up his sleeve like the one he used when killing Taragan.Yeon-woo, however, shook his head as he could not come up with a way to overcome the crisis.No, he about to shook his head, but he paused. Something else suddenly occurred to him.\u2018It\u2019s either we do something about it or we die. Then we have to at least try it out.\u2019Yeon-woo\u2019s mind was quickly racing. Just when he was thinking of a way to communicate his idea,\u2013 Ah, ah. Hyung, can you hear me?Yeon-woo jerked his head trying to find the source of the sudden noise, but he couldn\u2019t find the owner of the voice, only a fingernail-sized bug buzzing about his head.The bug landed onto Yeon-woo\u2019s right shoulder.Yeon-woo narrowed his eyes.\u201cIs this you, Doyle?\u201d\u2013 Hehe. That\u2019s a relief. I was wondering if this would work well. I can hear your voice too.\u201cYou had a bug that can deliver voices?\u201d\u2013 It\u2019s actually called a mind-conveyance bug, it allows its owner to deliver their thoughts through it\u2026 But, the details don\u2019t really matter, so you can think of it however is more comfortable for you.Yeon-woo silently nodded his head.\u2013 By the way, you must have thought of a way, right?Yeon-woo smirked a little. Doyle came just at the right moment when he was trying to figure out a way to deliver his plan.As expected, Doyle had quickly noticed that Yeon-woo had worked out a plan and made contact with him.\u201cCan you tell Kahn about this plan?\u201d\u2013 If you want me to just deliver the message, then yes.\u201cOkay. That\u2019ll do.\u201dYeon-woo raised the corner of his mouth and started to speak.* * **Rumble*Hargan finally finished his ritual and slowly rose from his seating position. Taragan\u2019s body was no longer there, instead, Hargan was now as big as Taragan had been. He was now three meters in size, holding his scimitar in one hand and Taragan\u2019s club in the other.He then let out a violent roar.Kuooo!The whole forest trembled as if it were about to collapse.\u201cHuman! Show yourself! Humaaan!\u201dHargan started searching around with his blazing eyes.*Kung* *Kung*The earth shook as the Heat Wave became even more intense. Steam was fuming out from the ground as it boiled from the extreme temperature.\u201cHuman! if you don\u2019t come out, I will find you!\u201dHargan grimaced and shifted his glare to one side. It was the place where the rubble left from the destroyed lair was scattered around, where the human had taken the lives of his precious wife and children.And when Hargan was about to rush towards the rubble,*Tak*Yeon-woo suddenly came out from behind a rock. Standing on top of the rock, he stuck out his finger and made a beckoning gesture towards Hargan.\u201cTry me.\u201d\u201cI will kill yooou!\u201dHargan kicked the ground with his feet.*Kwang*With just one dash, Hargan propelled himself towards where Yeon-woo was standing.The earth was quaking, and the Heat Wave was blowing in all directions. Flames surged from beneath the ground, giving sense of oppression. His skin almost dried up and burned from the heat just by standing near him, but Yeon-woo only stood still at the spot despite the approaching heat. He just kept a close watch on Hargan with his eyes half open.In that instant, something very thin started weaving itself near his heart. For the first time, mana was taking action on its own in order to protect its owner and invoke his skills.[Sense Strengthening][Combat Will]Time around Yeon-woo slowed down.No, to be precise, his maximized concentration accelerated his thought process, making everything except for his own consciousness seem to slow down.Yeon-woo could now clearly examine both the appearance of incoming Hargan and the Heat Waves surrounding him. Normally, his brain would have been under serious pressure. However, the changes caused by Flame Heart and Frost Crest helped him endure the pain.Yeon-woo, therefore, cast another skill. The mana flowing inside his body gathered around his eyes. The pupils in his eyes transformed into vertical slits.[Draconic Eyes]In a world brimming with flaws, Yeon-woo quickly glanced at his surroundings. Hargan, the Heat Waves, the flames\u2026 Their contours were all fluctuating with flaws. With this sight burned into his eyes, Yeon-woo made his move.*Kwang*Yeon-woo swiftly threw himself towards Hargan. A move that in the eyes of others, could only be seen as an act of suicide. However, Yeon-woo sliced along the flaws displayed amid the flames as he clove through the Heat Wave. Soon, his slice formed a diagonal fault from one side of his field of sight to another, and the upper side segment seemed to slide down along it,*Whoosh*The fire blocking Yeon-woo\u2019s way was suddenly put out. The Heat Wave was equally split in half and brushed past Yeon-woo.*Kwang*It was such an unbelievable spectacle even though it was happening right in front of their eyes.\u201cHumaaan!\u201dHargan dismissed this as a coincidence and kept swinging his scimitar ceaselessly. With every swing, pillars of flame gushed out from beneath and gales of Heat Waves swept the ground.*Swish* *Swish*However, Yeon-woo slashed a few times into their flaws and easily tore off the Heat Waves. This scene looked as if the flames were intentionally avoiding Yeon-woo.Eventually, Yeon-woo was able to reach Hargan and collided with him.*Kwang*After obtaining Targan\u2019s power, Hargan\u2019s strength was without a doubt destructive. The scimitar almost severed Yeon-woo in two pieces, but stopped right in front of Yeon-woo\u2019s brow. A tiny crack formed in the middle of the scimitar where it had clashed with Yeon-woo\u2019s dagger. It was the flaw. The dagger then started chiseling into the crack.Although it may not have been able to break the scimitar, it was enough to narrow the overwhelming gap in strength. That alone was a tremendous success.\u201cKwuuung!\u201dAs if not being able to tolerate it anymore, Hargan loudly roared and put even more strength into his scimitar. Once again, a wave of heated wind was storming across the lair.Yeon-woo avoided confronting him in terms of strength. He dodged left as he parried the attack to his right. The scimitar helplessly struck the groundHargan\u2019s body briefly stumbled after losing balance, and then,*Pat*Kahn and Doyle quickly jumped in as if they had been waiting for this moment. Kahn dashed right by Hargan, slicing his ankle. Doyle detonated a series of insect bombs made of flamebugs.\u201cYou insects!\u201dThe fact that he was being made a fool by mere humans further angered Hargan. So he roughly pulled out his scimitar and held it high in the air. It was the position required to cast Heat Wave.*Kwang*When that happened, Yeon-woo barged in and severed the corresponding flaw.\u201cHow dare yooou!\u201dHargan tried to attack Yeon-woo once again, and at the same time, Kahn and Doyled rushed to attack Hargan.*Kwang* *Kwang*The three of them faced Hargan by continuously making use of this disruptive tactic. Whenever Yeon-woo interrupted a Heat Wave, Kahn and Doyle would watch for a chance to attack, and when Hargan moved to catch the two, Yeon-woo would rush back from behind to grab his aggro.As a result, Hargan\u2019s aggro kept switching back and forth between the three of them as his skill kept getting interrupted midcast. And in the meantime, his wounds continued to accumulate and he was quickly losing stamina.However, Yeon-woo\u2019s party couldn\u2019t put themselves at ease yet. If their control went off for even a bit, it would be over for them. They had to keep their heads straight until very the end. Besides, their fatigue was also building up, and they had to cope with it with sheer mental strength.\u201cI will not forgive you! I have to avenge Taragan!\u201dBut at some point,*Rumble*Hargan\u2019s attacks began to slow down. The temperature around him also noticeably settled down.\u201cAvenge Taragan\u2026! Have to avenge\u2026my babies\u2026. \u201dHis voice also sounded weary.Just then, Yeon-woo moved.\u2018Now!\u2019*Shluk*Yeon-woo slid in between Hargan\u2019s legs and sliced his ankle, severing his artery.Hargan stumbled heavily due to the attack. If it hadn\u2019t been for their stream of continuous attacks, he would have been able to keep his balance and stand up immediately, but right now, Hargan was so exhausted that he barely managed to stand up after sticking his sword into the ground to support his body.In the meantime, Yeon-woo jumped on his shoulder and stretched out his left hand. Black energy clotted along his palm. It suddenly swung open side to side, revealing a series of serrated teeth. Yeon-woo then shoved them right into Hargan\u2019s neck which by now was full of wounds.It was his fourth time using a skill during the fight with Hargan.\u201cDevour.\u201d[Bathori\u2019s Vampiric Sword]Kyaaaak!The serrated teeth let out a terrible, nightmarish shriek.\u201cLet go! Let gooo!\u201dHargan tried to struggle free, feeling that his soul was being torn apart. He shook his body violently in an effort to get rid of Yeon-woo, but Kahn and Doyle took the chance to severe Hargan\u2019s wrist and stabbed other of his vital points in order to restrain his movement.[You have absorbed vitality and energy][Your Strength has increased by 3 points.][Your Dexterity has increased by 2 points.][\u2018Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword\u2019 skill proficiency has increased. 5.4%]Thanks to the enormous amount of vitality Hargan had, even though their tactic had tired him out, numerous messages were constantly filling up his retina.\u201cNo matter what! I will kill you no matter what!\u201dBut he realized the moment of death was upon him.Hargan poured out all his last remaining energy. The fire raged along his skin and soon engulfed Yeon-woo.*Rush*\u201cCain!\u201dThe intensity of the flames even made Kahn and Doyle stop their attacks and fall back. They could only worriedly watch Yeon-woo who was still stuck to Hargan.Despite the searing pain, Yeon-woo pushed the teeth deeper into Hargan\u2019s neck. He used the energy he extracted from him to heal himself and endure for longer.Then,*Kung*Finally, Hargan fell on one knee to the ground. He tried to stand up using his scimitar as a cane, it was the last bit of effort he could make.However, Yeon-woo\u2019s serrated teeth also completely swallowed such will. Hargan\u2019s hand slipped off the hilt and he collapsed to the floor.\u201cI have to\u2026 avenge Taragan\u2026 avenge our babies\u2026.\u201dIt was his last words before he finally closed his eyes.[You have slain the second boss monster, Hargan (Lizardmen King). Additional Karma will be provided according to your contribution to the raid.][You have acquired 2,000 Karma.]\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7[Quest completed.][You have made an achievement that is not easily accomplished. Additional Karma will be provided.][You have acquired 1,000 Karma.][You have acquired 500 additional Karma.]\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7The messages popped up frantically. It was only then that Yeon-woo got off from Hargan\u2019s corpse which had an appearance similar to that of a mummy.\u2018This is crazy.\u2019The world was spinning because of the intense heartburn and dizziness from the aftereffects of combining skills. The worst part was the burning pain in his eyes and brain due to the overload.\u2018Well, we still made it.\u2019The basis of his plan was Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword. The number 66 represented one of the best skills present in The Tower, so Yeon-woo was hoping it would somehow help him kill Hargan.Fortunately for them, the plan did work out as he expected. If they had made any mistake, instead of Hargan\u2019s, it would be their bodies lying on the floor right now.Now that he was seeing the messages that informed him of the quest completion and the death of the boss monster, he was finally able to calm down. But there was something else that made Yeon-woo happy the most. It was the message that popped up at the very last.[Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword has extracted the essence from the target, successfully stealing a part of the target\u2019s skill.][The skill \u2018Heat Wave\u2019 has been created.]\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Consume (2)[The proficiency of Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword is too low. Adjusting the grade of obtained the skill.][The skill \u2018Heat Wave\u2019 has been modified to \u2018Flame Infusion\u2019][Flame Infusion]Rating: D+Proficiency: 0.0%Description: Downgraded form of Hargan\u2019s (Lizardman King) innate skill, Heat Wave. Imbues the desired tool with fire. Fire of higher temperature can be created depending on the skill proficiency.\u201cInnate skill? And it\u2019s a buff skill?\u201dYeon-woo clenched his fists as he checked the skill description. He felt as if the after effects of combining skills was being washed away.Even if it had been downgraded to a lower rating, it was still an innate skill from a boss monster.Innate skill.It was similar to a Unique skill, but slightly different.They were both exclusive to specific beings \u2018only\u2019. Normally, no one except for the original owner could acquire such skill. Not only were they powerful, but they were also rare.However, unlike Unique skills which were limited to players, innate skills belonged to boss monsters. This meant that, even if the boss monster with an innate skill died, it would appear once again as the monster respawned in every round. This was also the reason for Hargan\u2019s appearance in this tutorial round, even though he had already been slain by his brother long time ago.So even though Heat Wave was Hargan\u2019s innate skill, it was also possible for other players to obtain it. But this was only in theory.Being present only in high-tier skills, the ability to extract skills wasn\u2019t commonly found in The Tower, much less in the tutorial. In particular, Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword was at the top of such skills, so it was safe to assume that Yeon-woo was the only one capable of stealing Hargan\u2019s skill at this stage.Because of the lack of skill proficiency, he didn\u2019t obtain Heat Wave as it was, but this was still a great achievement. He got his hands on a buff skill that can even infuse a tool with the fire property.\u2018An artifact\u2019s power will increase when imbued with certain properties. That\u2019s why artifacts with elemental buffs are usually traded at high prices.\u2019Now, Yeon-woo didn\u2019t need to find an artifact with elemental buffs. Furthermore, Flame Infusion could be used for various other purposes. Fire was a very offensively-oriented and versatile element.\u2018I\u2019ll have to test it later.\u2019Yeon-woo slowly closed the skill window in a satisfied mood. While he was focused on his newly acquired skill, the after effects he was suffering from also ameliorated to a certain degree.He rose slowly from his seated position while trying to maintain balance. Seeing this, Kahn and Doyle came to support him.\u201cDude, your body\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t easy for Kahn to speak, as he was too worried about Yeon-woo.Yeon-woo had directly faced Hargan\u2019s last Heat Wave. Several burn marks could be seen through his half burnt clothes. His white mask was also distorted from the intense heat.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m all right. It\u2019s just hard to move, but it will get better over time.\u201dIf he hadn\u2019t been able to heal his injuries with the energy drained by Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword, it would have been the end for him. But Yeon-woo waved his hand to express that he was fine.\u201cLet me check, man.\u201d\u201cYeah Hyung. Sit down for a moment in case you\u2019re hurt anywhere else.\u201dHowever, Kahn and Doyle didn\u2019t take their worried looks off of him. They couldn\u2019t just leave him alone.Yeon-woo thought for a moment of how to get them off of him, and as he realized that there were still people locked up in the cages, he pointed towards the lair with his chin.\u201cI\u2019m okay, I really don\u2019t need your help. But there are still people over there, is it okay to leave them like that? They might be in danger because of the fire.\u201dOnly then did Doyle remember the people still trapped in the human farm. He took Kahn with him and hurried over to the cages.Yeon-woo was finally able to rest with his back against a half-burnt tree stump. Then he closed his eyes and immersed himself into meditation in order to completely alleviate the aftereffects.* * *The slaves were successfully rescued.Fortunately, Hargan\u2019s Heat Wave did not reach the human farm. Perhaps because it was a place assigned to preserve food for the hatchlings, it seemed they had designed this space to suffer less damage from outside impact.\u201cThank you, thank you very much!\u201d\u201cUhunghung!\u201dPeople burst into tears as their shackles and chains were being unlocked.And after recovering, some of them even started to brazenly kick Hargan\u2019s dead body over and over again. Other players even vented their anger on some of the remaining Lizardmen.They had been brought back from the brink of death, but their teammates who they had been laughing and chatting with just a few days ago had been eaten alive by the Lizardmen hatchlings right in front of their eyes. It was natural for their blood to boil just from looking at the monsters.Kahn and Doyle just stood there watching until they finally settled down.After the people had somewhat alleviated their anger, a middle-aged man with bald head approached them to express his gratitude.\u201cI\u2019d like to thank you one more time. Thanks to you, we\u2019ve been able to avenge our teammates\u2026 With the monsters dead, they\u2019ll be able to rest peacefully.\u201dKahn and Doyle waved their hands.\u201cNo need to thank us, we only did what we were supposed to do.\u201dKahn calmly shook his head. With his character, he would have answered proudly, but right now he contained himself because he had noticed the heavy atmosphere. Still, his eyes were filled with pride.Then the middle-aged man asked him.\u201cOh, by the way, may I ask you a question?\u201d\u201cYes. Say it.\u201d\u201cI was wondering if you\u2019re Kahn, the Blood Sword. Are you him?\u201d\u201cOh, wow. I tried to keep it a secret. Haha!\u201dKahn pretended to be embarrassed by scratching the back of his head, but he couldn\u2019t stop his lips from curling upward.People\u2019s eyes grew wider.\u201cIs, is he really Kahn, the Blood Sword?\u201d\u201cNo wonder! I can\u2019t think of anyone else capable of slaying the Lizardman King.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve only heard rumors about him, but he really is great. I can\u2019t hold a candle to him.\u201d\u201cThen, the person next to him\u2026 isn\u2019t he Foxy Tail?\u201d\u201cYeah, I think you\u2019re right.\u201dThe more the people praised him, the broader his grin became.Doyle shook his head as he looked at Kahn. He wondered how could Kahn love being shone under the spotlight that much.Even though Kahn was smirking, he did not forget to give his teammates due credit.\u201cHaha! Thank you all for your compliment. But I must say, I\u2019m not the only one who participated in Hargan\u2019s raid. In fact, I was only there helping our teammate. If we didn\u2019t have our friend over there, hmm\u2026 I don\u2019t even want to imagine what could have happened.\u201dKahn shook his head as he spoke in a humorous manner.Thanks to his efforts in making a pleasant atmosphere, people were slowly making themselves at ease. However, as soon as they turned their heads towards the direction Kahn had pointed, their faces became stiff again.Yeon-woo was sitting there.Unlike Kahn and Doyle, he was sitting far away from the crowd, lost in meditation.People immediately looked away from Yeon-woo. Some of them even frowned or spat on the floor as if they had seen something disgusting.Kahn noticed the change in atmosphere, so he cautiously inquired the man.\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d\u201cThat person over there, is he your teammate?\u201d\u201cYes, he is.\u201d\u201cThen I must warn you, please be careful going around with that man.\u201dKahn\u2019s face also darkened.\u201cI\u2019d like to ask you for the reason.\u201d\u201cWhen Doyle first found us in the cages, it was him who told him to abandon us.\u201dThe middle-aged man glared at Yeon-woo with an angry frown.Other players also recalled the conflict between Yeon-woo and Doyle at the time. Eventually, Doyle had also turned his back towards them, but the only thing left in their heads was the callous look of Yeon-woo who had tried to ditch them first.Kahn looked at Doyle with a gloomy expression asking for the truth.Doyle wanted to explain why Yeon-woo had to say such a thing, but there were too many people watching them, so he couldn\u2019t help but sigh and nod.The middle-aged man took it as a \u2018yes\u2019, and went on talking with great excitement.\u201cI may be crossing the line by saying this, but he is simply not a human being\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. You\u2019ve just crossed the line.\u201dAt that moment, Kahn looked back at the middle-aged man as he stopped him in mid-sentence.The middle-aged man was taken aback by the unexpected response.\u201cP, pard\u2026.\u201d\u201cI said, you\u2019re way out of the line.\u201dKahn approached the middle-aged man, pinching his lips.The middle-aged man froze in perplexity of Kahn\u2019s cold attitude. Even other players were nervous about this situation.But without caring about their embarrassment, Kahn stood right in front on the middle-aged man with his sneer, and he poked the man in the chest with his finger.\u201cNo matter what he said before, he is one of the people who just saved your asses. And if you haven\u2019t noticed, he\u2019s also the teammate of me and Doyle and he\u2019s the one who got hurt the most in our raid.\u201dKahn no longer spoke in a polite tone.Respect should only be paid to those who deserved it. But look at these ungrateful douchebags. They could get mad for all he cared.\u201cBut what did you idiots do? One thing for sure is that you were stupid enough to get yourselves stuck in this lair. Now you made it out of the cages alive, and that\u2019s all thanks to him. And what did you just say? Be careful around him? Well, why don\u2019t you be careful with what you say?\u201dHumiliation hit the man hard. His face turned red and his clenched fists started to quiver.However, Kahn laughed at his reaction.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You want to punch me in the face? Go ahead. Hit me. You were too scared to do anything in front of the Lizardman King, but now you\u2019re suddenly so brave \u2018cuz we\u2019re players, right? Well, hurry up and punch me.\u201dKahn even stuck out his cheek outright.The middle-aged man\u2019s eyelids trembled. Then, he turned around to look for someone to help him.The people who had been trapped in the farm and had promised to die together were now looking away from him in fear of getting involved. No one tried to help the man.The middle-aged man finally realized his situation.\u201cI, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cWhat? I can\u2019t hear you.\u201dKahn creased his brows, putting his ears close to the middle-aged man\u2019s mouth.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe middle-aged man\u2019s voice was shaking.*Sneer*Kahn then laughed a little and backed off.\u201cYou need to apologize someone else too, don\u2019t you think?\u201dIt was obvious whom he was talking about.The middle-aged man bit his lower lip and looked at Yeon-woo. He was still meditating in his seated position, without paying any attention to that side.Kahn pointed at Yeon-woo and hurried the man.The middle-aged man slowly approached Yeon-woo with trembling steps. He apologized with his back bent in 90 degrees.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. Please forgive me for my slip of tongue.\u201dYeon-woo didn\u2019t respond for a long time. As such, the middle-aged man couldn\u2019t straighten his back.Yeon-woo opened his eyes with irritation and gave him a little nod. Then he closed his eyes again. It was only then that the middle-aged man could raise his body.The players watching the scene kept their mouth closed.The strong and the weak. Such relationship was already showing here as well.* * *The middle-aged man, Brend, returned to the crowd with his mouth shut. People began to shuffle away, afraid that he would talk to them. Soon, there was no one left around him.Brend bit his lips and searched for a place to sit down.\u2018Dirty traitors.\u2019 Brend gritted his teeth.They used to cling to him when they were locked up by the Lizardmen. Whenever they needed anything, he would risk his life to get it from them. But now that he was in need, they all avoided him.He was feeling dirty and miserable. He resented Kahn and Doyle for humiliating him simply because they had saved him. Also, he cursed the one who brought this problem onto him.\u201cUhm, Hyung-nim[1].\u201dJust then, a skinny man approached Brend and carefully stood next to him. His name was Ethan. He had been following Brand the most since he had been trapped in the human farm.When he had first met Ethan, he was one of those ordinary players who were brought to the farm with their teammates. One day, Brend found him on the verge of dying, so he stepped up and helped him. Since then Ethan had started to follow him around, saying he\u2019d serve him as a \u2018Hyung-nim\u2019.Brend also found him very smart and witty, so he decided to keep him company. But today, he was the first to avoid his gaze when he asked for help.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dTherefore, no good response came out of Brend\u2019s mouth.Noticing Brend\u2019s cold attitude, Ethan carefully opened his mouth.\u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cThat I wasn\u2019t there to support you. I, I hope you understand. You know about us\u2026 About how we s, survived through here.\u201dBrend glared at Ethan, but soon gave out a deep sigh.Ethan and his teammates were just like mayflies. They had been surviving from section to section by following behind the back of other skilled players. So, even if he wanted to blame Ethan, it would just be waste of his breath. He couldn\u2019t believe how they had even reached Section E with their trifling skills. But he was too fed up with him, he didn\u2019t want to talk to him anymore.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to pull off right now but, just leave me alone.\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t mean you any harm, so please hear me out.\u201dBrend gave a fierce scowl at Ethan. He was already boiling with anger, and Ethan just had to come to get on his nerves. He felt an impulse to throw a rock at him, but Eden\u2019s sudden remark stopped Brend from taking action.\u201cHyung-nim, don\u2019t you need Tokens or artifacts?\u201d\u201cWhy do you c\u2026!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve got a treasure trove over there, just waiting for us to crack it open. So, why don\u2019t we go and make a fortune?\u201dIn the direction where Ethan was pointing at,Brend saw Kahn and Doyle walking up to Yeon-woo.[1] A more formal way of saying hyung.

Consume (3)Tokens.Artifacts.For a brief moment, Brend thought that it was very tempting, but he soon came to his senses and shook the idea out of his head.\u201cDon\u2019t you dare try to trick me.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018trick\u2019? We\u2019re doing this to survive.\u201d\u201cTo survive? You want to survive by killing the people who saved our lives?\u201dEthan was so frightened he jumped to his feet.\u201cWe\u2019re not killing anyone! Who said we are? Pick a fight with them and we\u2019ll be lying dead on the floor.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m talking about stealing.\u201dBrend then began to show interest in his story.A sly grin crept over Ethan\u2019s face.\u201cThe monsters took all of our stuff and now we\u2019ve got nothing with us. I mean, if we go out there, we\u2019re just gonna die, aren\u2019t we?\u201dBrend nodded without saying a word.In that sense, Ethan did have a point. All the artifacts and Tokens he had collected on his way to Section E had been taken away by the Lizardman King. He had nothing to protect himself with.For now, Kahn and Doyle could help him out of this place, but the tutorial was already reaching the end so they would leave sooner or later. That meant he would have to wander around the forest like this. He would have to stay hidden and wait out until the end of the tutorial or he would fall prey to other monsters. There were no other choices other than that.\u201cSo, let\u2019s just steal enough to survive independently and then we\u2019ll run away.\u201d\u201cWhat if we get caught? They\u2019ll kill us.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s the possibility of death whether we steal or not. But if we do it my way the chances to survive are higher.\u201dBefore he knew it, Brend had already been halfly persuaded by Ethan.\u201cThen, what about the plan? We can\u2019t just proceed without a plan.\u201d\u201cHehe. You didn\u2019t think I came here without a plan, did ya?\u201dEthan simpered for a moment and continued talking.\u201cOne of my friends has a Trait called \u2018Quick Hands(\u5feb\u624b)\u2019.\u201d\u201cQuick Hands? Like nimble fingers?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s amazing what he can pull off with his hands.\u201dBrend could roughly understand Ethan\u2019s plan. If he had a Trait regarding nimble fingers, he must also have specialized skills according to his Trait.\u201cSo, this friend of yours will steal what we need while others draw their attention, is this the plan?\u201d\u201cYou got the gist of it. So, what do you think?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dBrend fell into deep thought calculating the probabilities. He thought about the risks that the plan entailed and the probability of success, and realized that the odds were very low. But from deep inside his mind, greed started to set in. If they did succeed, they could make a killing. And then, the memory of him being humiliated by Kahn and Yeon-woo suddenly reappeared in his mind.*Gnash*That alone was enough to motivate him.\u201cAll right. Tell me what you\u2019ve got.\u201dBrend\u2019s eyes began to emit a vicious glow.Ethan broke into an evil grin and explained the plans he had designed with his teammates. All throughout his talk, Ethan\u2019s eyes were shining with madness.* * *After a long time, Yeon-woo woke up from his meditation.\u2018A stronger body does help with relieving the after effects.\u2019Yeon-woo\u2019s body was not fully capable of coping with the overload yet, so it was better to avoid using multiple skills at once. But luckily, thanks to Reinforced Physique and Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword, his body could quickly recover from the damage it suffered.From the start, if it weren\u2019t for Hargan\u2019s second phase, he wouldn\u2019t have overdone himself.\u2018But it was at least a great chance to test my limits.\u2019A clear understanding of his limits would allow him to execute cool-headed judgment when taking action. From this experience, Yeon-woo clearly realized what Reinforced Physique was capable of, and was able to further establish the possible strategies he could rely on.After organizing his thoughts, Yeon-woo once again entered Hargan\u2019s Lair along with Kahn and Doyle. It was time to claim the reward for completing the hidden quest.[Rewards will be provided.][You have acquired Hargan\u2019s Crown, Blue Scale Scimitar, ownership of the lair.]\u201cNow that Cain is here, shall we settle things first?\u201dKahn gently clapped his hands as he smacked his lips. The time to distribute the rewards after having a hard time carrying out the quest was the most exciting part of it.\u201cDoyle and I will take Hargan\u2019s Crown as we promised, okay?\u201dKahn glimpsed Yeon-woo as he brought his hands over to Hargan\u2019s Crown.In fact, Yeon-woo was the highest contributor in Hargan\u2019s raid. Even though they were the ones who had shared the information about this place with him, if Yeon-woo wanted to claim the crown as his share, it would pose a big problem for them. But to his relief, Yeon-woo didn\u2019t seem interested in Hargan\u2019s Crown.He was nodding his head in assent.\u201cYou can have it.\u201dKahn\u2019s complexion visibly brightened.\u201cThanks, bro! Huhu. I knew you were a good guy from the get go!\u201d\u201cStop joking around.\u201d\u201cHuhuhu. I know you\u2019re just shy.\u201dLooking at Kahn\u2019s smirking face, Yeon-woo felt the urge to give him a noogie, but he just let out a chuckle.Kahn was the kind of person that was just impossible to hate. He was such a strange guy.\u201cDoyle, go ahead and take it.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dDoyle grabbed Hargan\u2019s Crown and tightly held onto it. A bright smile spread across his face.\u201cAnd about the ownership of the lair and the Blue Scale Scimitar, they\u2019re all yours, Cain.\u201dThat was the deal they had made.After a nod, Yeon-woo examined the scimitar they had taken from Hargan\u2019s carcass.[Blue Scale Scimitar]Classification: Two-handed WeaponRating: D+Description: Hargan\u2019s (Lizardman King) favorite weapon. The weapon is imbued with the fire element. It boasts strong durability, destroying everything that comes into contact with. However, due to its heavy weight, the sword will not budge without extreme muscle strength.* Majesty of the Lizardman KingBy the mere possession of the weapon, the user emits an imperious aura. Has a certain chance of inflicting \u2018panic\u2019 on the target. Targets under the effect of panic will receive damage in direct proportion to the duration of the effect.Maybe because it was used by a big monster like Hargan, the scimitar was almost as big as Yeon-woo. Yeon-woo found even just carrying it around quite cumbersome.If he only looked at its options, the scimitar seemed to be as good as Hargan\u2019s Crown. It was one of the best artifacts one could get in the tutorial. But Yeon-woo usually used a short dagger as his main weapon. This type of sword did not fit Yeon-woo\u2019s style. In addition, the ownership of the lair was also useless for Yeon-woo.[Ownership of Hargan\u2019s Lair]Obtain rights to all objects and resources that exist within the lair.* List of items in the lair1. Red Orc\u2019s Helmet2. Axe of Battlecry3. Hard Crystal x31\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Yeon-woo scrutinized the listed items.Although most of the items had been damaged by Hargan\u2019s Heat Wave, there was still a considerable number of items left in the storage room. Among them, there were quite a few good items, but Khan and Doyle had no qualms about handing them over to Yeon-woo.Of course, the list also included items used by those who had been captured in the human farm. From a moral standpoint, the correct thing to do would be to give the items back to the original owners. However, the three of them didn\u2019t think of giving them back.There was an unspoken rule in The Tower and the tutorial. No matter who the original owner of the item might have been, the items belong to the ones who found them.But Yeon-woo didn\u2019t need these items either.\u2018Some of these artifacts might come in handy for now, still, there are plenty of them inside The Tower.\u2019But at least he found one thing worth taking.[Carshina\u2019s Dagger]Classification: One-handed WeaponRating: D-Description: A dagger that had been used by a nameless trainee throughout his life. Made with common materials, but the blade hardened as it retains the passion of the trainee.* Will of TraineeWeapon damage will increase along with the user\u2019s weapon proficiency.Yeon-woo touched \u2018Carshina\u2019s Dagger\u2019 and held it in his hand.The weight and size of the dagger were similar to those he had been wielding so far, so it was quite easy to get used to it.If there was anything that was missing,\u2018The blade is slightly bent.\u2019But it was all right.\u2018The daggers I had were getting really damaged, they are barely usable by now. This will suffice for the remaining of the tutorial.\u2019He was also fond of the extra option it had.Yeon-woo put Carshina\u2019s Dagger next to his waist and examined the rest of the list. However, there was nothing useful for Yeon-woo. Even the resources in the lair didn\u2019t have much use.\u2018I do need plenty of minerals to make artifacts, but if I can\u2019t store them somewhere else, they will only make my backpack heavier. The materials gathered from monsters are also more expensive.\u2019Yeon-woo had taken the Tokens that Hargan had collected in advance. Thanks to that, he had now over 200 Tokens in total.In the end, Yeon-woo had to close the message without much gain.\u2018Well, I wasn\u2019t expecting anyway.\u2019But Yeon-woo wasn\u2019t particularly disappointed. Disappointment only comes after expectation. In fact, Yeon-woo didn\u2019t expect much from the start. His brother mentioned it in his diary after all, that the rewards were quite small compared to the risk and difficulty. The sole reason as for why Yeon-woo had accepted this quest was to collect the Karma and Tokens he lacked.And then,\u2018Even if they are scrap items, with this much quantity, I can still sell them at a high price.\u2019Doyle then carefully asked Yeon-woo.\u201cIs there anything wrong, Cain? There wasn\u2019t anything you needed?\u201dHe seemed worried that Yeon-woo might have to leave without making much profit.Yeon-woo thought that Doyle needed to grow a thicker skin for times like this. Doyle was too soft-hearted. Yeon-woo wondered how did he think he could climb The Tower full of monsters with such a heart. But at the same time, he knew that this was Doyle\u2019s charm.Yeon-woo smiled and shook his head.\u201cThey are mostly useless. But don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t be a total loss.\u201dAs Doyle looked at Yeon-woo with a puzzled look, Yeon-woo fixed his eyes onto an empty space and spoke.\u201cYou\u2019ll hurt your neck if you keep watching us like that.\u201dDoyle turned to the direction Yeon-woo was talking to.Kahn also looked to the side with a bit of a serious face.At that moment.\u201cWell, well, did I get caught already? I wanted to surprise you.\u201dA portal opened in midair and a figure dropped down.A man with his hood drawn over his face was giving him a big smirk.It was the mysterious merchant.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Consume (4)With the arrival of the mysterious merchant, Kahn\u2019s and Doyle\u2019s eyes grew wider.\u201cHyung, do you also know the mysterious merchant?\u201dDoyle looked at Yeon-woo with a surprised face.Yeon-woo lightly nodded.\u201cA little.\u201d\u201cHey, how can you be so mean to me? I thought we had something special going on. Ohoho!\u201dThe mysterious merchant gave a silly smirk as he babbled out some nonsensical jokes. He didn\u2019t try hiding his fondness for Yeon-woo at all, which made Doyle eve more astonished.In fact, the mysterious merchant was not someone one could easily have access to. He seldom showed himself in the waiting room of each section, or in the boss rooms. There was never a set time or reason for him to appear. Therefore, most people stayed in the waiting room and waited for an indefinite amount of time for the mysterious merchant to show up. But now, he had just popped up out of nowhere.Of course, it wasn\u2019t actually impossible to personally strike a deal with the mysterious merchant.\u201cAnd also, glad to see you again, Kahn and Doyle. We haven\u2019t met since you purchased the pass tickets, right?\u201dThe mysterious merchant then greeted Kahn and Doyle.\u201cOh, yeah.\u201dKahn nodded with a sour face. He felt like he was getting a heartburn just by recalling how he had paid with his attribute points to buy the tickets to go to Section B\u2019s waiting room.The methods one could use to befriend the mysterious merchant were very simple. One was to rank within the top 10 in the tutorial rankings. That was how Kahn had acquainted with the mysterious merchant.And the other was,\u2018To be acknowledged by him.\u2019It seemed like Yeon-woo was one of those \u2018acknowledged\u2019 people.Kahn thought it was understandable. Considering what Yeon-woo had shown him so far, there was no way the mysterious merchant or the guardian wouldn\u2019t pay attention to him.After the simple greeting, the mysterious merchant quickly turned to Yeon-woo.\u201cBy the way, would you mind telling me how you noticed I was here? I was so confident that I was hidding pretty well.\u201dKahn and Doyle nodded as well. The mysterious merchant was like the guardian, he belonged to The Tower, so normal players couldn\u2019t notice their presence.However, Yeon-woo flatly replied.\u201cIt would be dumb of me not to notice you when you\u2019re staring at me like that.\u201d*Grunt* \u201cI see, you are not going to tell me.\u201dThe mysterious merchant let out a groan at Yeon-woo\u2019s reply. But under the robes, his eyes were giving off a strange glow. He had known it from the time Yeon-woo purchased the reset tickets for section A that no one else had bought before. In many ways, Yeon-woo was a very strange person. But the mysterious merchant put on his usual smile, suppressing his feelings from showing.\u201cBut next time, please show me some wit and pretend you don\u2019t see me. You\u2019ve just ruined the fun, don\u2019t you think? Ohohoho.\u201dYeon-woo tilted his head as if questioning his true intentions.\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t known you were here, weren\u2019t you going to wait and pocket our items?\u201dThe mysterious merchant grinned.\u201cMy, my, you must have read my mind.\u201dYeon-woo shook his head as he looked at the mysterious merchant whose face was still filled with a smirk.If I were asked to name things one should never trust in The Tower, the first thing would be the mysterious merchants. Contrary to what rumors say, that they don\u2019t come outside very often, they always keep a close watch on players while hiding right next to them to pick up the items that they\u2019ve missed or threw away.His brother said that the being that players should be wary against the most, was the mysterious merchant.They would never get the short end of the stick. Rather, they would be happy to dig around in filth if they could find anything profitable inside. They always kept an eye on players and secretly took things they abandoned and sold them at a high price.If Yeon-woo had left the lair with only the items he needed in his hands, He would have shown up belatedly and taken everything left in the lair. Of course, Yeon-woo wasn\u2019t going to give away his items that easily.\u201c150 Tokens.\u201dSudden words without any explanation.It was a bargain. The price for the ownership of the lair and the Blue Scale Scimitar.Kahn and Doyle then turned towards the mysterious merchant with excited faces. But the mysterious merchant snorted at Yeon-woo\u2019s bargain with his arms crossed.\u201cOh dear, now you\u2019re trying to bargain with me. But, you know, even the top rankers\u2026\u201d\u201c160.\u201d\u201c\u2026can\u2019t get that\u2026.\u201d\u201c180.\u201d\u201c\u2026many Tokens\u2026\u201d\u201c200.\u201dAs the mysterious merchant went on talking, Yeon-woo kept increasing the number.\u201c250.\u201d\u201c\u2026do you think you can sell them at that price? Really?\u201d\u201c300. You better take my offer quickly. The more you hesitate, the higher the number will be.\u201dThen Yeon-woo raised the corners of his mouth.\u201cAnd of course, if you don\u2019t accept it, I will blow up the entire lair. Along with all the Magic Stones inside the lair.\u201cMagic Stones like those are pretty easy to get, I can\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know you could get Magic Stones with a purity of over 70 so easily. Then I guess I\u2019ll have to blow them all up.\u201dFor the first time, the mysterious merchant\u2019s expression became stiff. Yeon-woo saw through that, and that was exactly what he was aiming for. As such, his smile grew bigger.\u2018As long as I\u2019m not a fool, there\u2019s no way I can lose if I know exactly what my opponent is after.\u2019It was only much later that the question arose in my mind. Why did Hargan\u2019s Lair quest give us so few rewards? And why did it give ownership of the lair as compensation?The Tower is a place where players are rewarded according to their achievements. So there must have been a reason.Later, I figured out that Hargan\u2019s Lair had a rich mineral reserve of fine Magic Stones.But when I found out about it, I wasn\u2019t too disappointed. Even if I had known beforehand, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do anything with it.A Magic Stone was a basic medium to store and deliver mana. It was similar to an electrical conductor on Earth. The stones with higher purity were more efficient in transferring mana, so those with a purity of over 70 sold at a very high price. That was the reason why the mysterious merchant had his eyes on Hargan\u2019s Lair.Of course, if the lair contained Magic Stones worth that much, I could take them for myself. But the higher the purity is, the more complicated the mining process becomes.\u2019His brother had also found it worthless even after learning about the secret of the quest.\u2018I\u2019d rather spend more time collecting Tokens.\u2019So to speak, the reserve of Magic Stones inside the lair was a white elephant to Yeon-woo. If so, he was better off selling it to the people who needed it. And the mysterious merchant appeared right in front of him just in time.The mysterious merchant finally realized that he had completely fallen in the trap Yeon-woo had set up. And now, there was nothing he could do about it.\u201cHmm\u2026! Still, 300 Tokens is too expensive for\u2026.\u201d\u201c400.\u201d\u201cO, okay okay! Stop! I\u2019ll pay, so don\u2019t raise it anymore! I\u2019m really gonna go broke!\u201dThe mysterious merchant finally waved the white flag.Yeon-woo gave a victorious smile.\u201cGood. I\u2019ll sell it for 405 Tokens. Five is for wasting my time.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve never seen anyone worse than me.\u201dThe mysterious merchant let out a deep sigh, and stretched his hand wide into the air.*Hum*Then, a blueish magic circle was drawn in the air and the message popped up in front of Yeon-woo.[You have sold \u2018Blue Scale Scimitar\u2019 and \u2018the ownership of Hargan\u2019s Lair\u2019, and obtained 405 Tokens in exchange.]Yeon-woo noticed that the scimitar in his hand and the entire lair around him had disappeared. Instead, a new window appeared.[698 Tokens]Yeon-woo had less than 100 Tokens before this raid, but now it had increased to nearly 700 simply by clearing a quest and selling some items.As Yeon-woo\u2019s trade ended in success, Kahn and Doyle were shaking their heads without closing their mouths. It was their first time seeing the mysterious merchant being forced into a deal.After completing the deal, the mysterious merchant kept muttering to himself, saying things like \u2018it was a total loss\u2019, \u2018there was nothing left\u2019, \u2018I got scammed\u2019, and so on.\u201cOh, and one more thing.\u201dWhen Yeon-woo opened his mouth, the mysterious merchant appeared slightly vigilant of his words.\u201cW, what else are you going to rip off from me?\u201d\u201cYou sound like I\u2019m bullying you. Anyway, I forgot to tell you, I have something I want to buy.\u201dThis was finally his chance. The mysterious merchant grinned.\u201cUhuhu, what do have in mind?\u201dYeon-woo pointed at the mask he was wearing.\u201cYou see, it\u2019s a little melted. I need something similar.\u201dFor a short moment, the mysterious merchant\u2019s face distorted.\u201cWell, I do have things like that. Oh, by the way, it will cost you four Streng\u2026.\u201d\u201cOf course, throw that into our deal.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t just do that!\u201d\u201cThen I guess you want to cancel our deal. It doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dIn the mysterious merchant\u2019s mind, he had already hit the ceiling and was hurling all kinds of insults at Yeon-woo. But he couldn\u2019t miss out such a big deal for such a trivial thing. In the end, the mysterious merchant once again stretched out his hand while grinding his teeth in indignation.[You have acquired the \u2018Face of White Ghost\u2019]Yeon-woo patted the mask in his hand.It had a similar design to the one he had been using, but slightly different. It wasn\u2019t made of plastic, but of a material he had never seen before.\u201cI noticed you were having a hard time because of the mask, so I prepared something good \u2018specially\u2019 for you. And next time we meet, if you keep bullying me like today, I\u2019m not going to stick with your play, okay?\u201dYeon-woo checked the artifact with a strange look.[Face of White Ghost]Classification: HeadgearRating: E+Description: A mask with various spirits ensnared inside. The mere use of it gives off a bizarre atmosphere, and allows the user to hide some of their presence.Once worn, it doesn\u2019t come off easily. If damaged, it can restore itself by capturing another spirits.It was a mask without any special options. However, Yeon-woo liked the line describing that it wouldn\u2019t fall off from his face easily and that it would recover itself from damage.Yeon-woo turned to the side so that the others could not see his face, and removed the mask he had been wearing. He was somewhat amazed at how the mask wasn\u2019t completely ruined yet considering what he had been through. But now, he had to bid farewell to his old mask.Yeon-woo easily crushed the old mask and threw it to the floor, and wore Face of White Ghost. The material felt odd on his skin. He patted on the mask to test if it fit its description. Thankfully, the mask was stuck on his face like a leech.\u201cI appreciate your kindness.\u201d\u201cLike hell you do!\u201d *Sigh*The mysterious merchant packed up the bundle he had brought with him and put it back on his shoulder. However, despite his sigh, he couldn\u2019t erase the smile lingering on his face.The mysterious merchant opened a portal and got ready to leave.While he was sticking his foot inside, he thought of something and looked back at Yeon-woo.\u201cOh, by the way.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWhen you were bargaining for the Magic Stones, you seemed almost too brave as if you knew something. So tell me, was that because you knew what\u2019s going on \u2018on the other side\u2019?\u201dUnder the robes, the eyes of the mysterious merchant shone keenly.However, Yeon-woo replied in a calm manner.\u201cOn the other side? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cHuh. Well, it\u2019s nothing. I must have been mistaken.\u201dThe mysterious merchant shook his head and disappeared over the portal.Even while the blue portal was closing, Yeon-woo still kept calm. His new mask made it even harder to tell the expression he had just by looks, even more so his thoughts.\u2018Now it\u2019s clear. The arms race between clans and between rankers in The Tower has become very fierce.\u2019Yeon-woo\u2019s eyes let out a cold glow.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Consume (5)High-purity Magic Stones are the base material for crafting higher-grade artifacts. There\u2019s a limited number of buyers, so their price is usually constant. However, despite naming an exorbitant price, the mysterious merchant still purchased the stones. This meant that there must have been a sudden increase in demand for Magic Stones. The number of rankers couldn\u2019t have changed, so it could only lead to one conclusion.\u2018The only reason to mass produce higher-grade artifacts. It must be a war.\u2019During the time when his brother was in The Tower, Arthia had been targeted by numerous clans and rankers due to their rapid growth. Then their enemies formed an alliance, leading Arthia to its downfall.Now, it had been quite a long time since Arthia had disappeared. Their alliance had petered out, which resulted in confrontations between themselves.No major antagonism must have taken place yet. If it had, it would have affected the tutorial to some extent. But at least, it was clear that some preparations were happening behind the scenes. This arms race was proof of it.\u2018That\u2019s right. They may have made a temporary alliance in order to face a common enemy, but peace will never be everlasting in a world full of wolves.\u2019Yeon-woo laughed happily at the fact that his prediction was coming true. The more they bite each other, the more vulnerable they\u2019ll become.But,\u2018It\u2019s not the time yet.\u2019Yeon-woo wasn\u2019t even in The Tower yet.It would take him a long time to finally bite into their necks. So his plans were still a long way off.* * *Kahn and Doyle were astonished at Yeon-woo\u2019s ability to haggle, and at the same time they were so glad that all the troubles were finally over. With Hargan\u2019s Crown in their hands, their efforts seemed to have paid off. They had even gone all the way back to Section B\u2019s waiting room just for this.And now, it was time to move on to the next stage.Kahn and Doyle secretly exchanged glances with each other. They were already close enough to understand each other\u2019s feelings without having to talk. The mere glance was enough to exchange their thoughts.Kahn came forward and asked Yeon-woo.\u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d\u201cDo what?\u201dYeon-woo turned to look at Kahn while fastening his dagger to his belt.\u201cI\u2019m talking about your schedule. What\u2019s your plan? You must have collected tons of Tokens by now. Are you gonna go straight to Section F?\u201dYeon-woo did not immediately answer Kahn\u2019s questions, instead, he briefly checked the tutorial rankings.[Tutorial Ranking]1. Edora (63,101 Points)2. Phante (57,612 Points)3. Kahn (55,212 Points)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b752. Unknown (32,594 Points) (You)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u2018That was roughly a ten thousand points increase.\u2019His rank suddenly jumped from 150th to 52nd. The Tokens he earned from the trade must have contributed to this increase. The speed was insanely fast.\u2018But still, the gap between me and the first rank\u2026 That\u2019s even crazier.\u2019The Karma points in Phante\u2019s score remained almost unchanged. Thanks to the 5,000 points Kahn earned through Hargan\u2019s Lair quest, Kahn was now only a small distance behind of him.However, Edora was different. It wasn\u2019t sure if he had places to farm points or if he was so determined to secure his spot, but he had also accumulated more than 6,000 points in this short period of time. However, Yeon-woo didn\u2019t think it was impossible to pull ahead of him.\u2018I still have my ace in the hole.\u2019The guy that dwelled in Section E. The best hidden piece concealed in the tutorial. It was the target Yeon-woo had been aiming for from the very beginning.\u2018The time is now.\u2019The vessel was complete, and he had everything he needed. Yeon-woo was going to part ways with his party and head over there.Moreover, he had seen the pain his brother had gone through. Yeon-woo had a great distrust towards the concept of teams and clans.So he shook his head in denial.\u201cNo. I\u2019m not going directly to Section F.\u201dThe Kahn\u2019s complexion visibly brightened.\u201cThen, do you want to\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut I have a business to attend to.\u201dKahn had to stop mid sentence.\u201cA business to attend to?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs Kahn was lost for words, Doyle intervened in the conversation.\u201cHyung, there\u2019s something we\u2019ve been wanting to ask you. Will you come with us?\u201d\u201cCome with you?\u201d\u201cYes. Until the tutorial is over. No, even after we enter The Tower.\u201dLooking at Yeon-woo, Doyle\u2019s eyes were glistening.\u201cIn fact, Kahn and I have talked about this a lot. You and us, we really clicked together. And we achieved more than we had expected, right? Maybe if the three of us team up\u2026!\u201dDoyle poured out a flurry of words in excitement.However,\u201cNo. I can\u2019t.\u201dYeon-woo\u2019s response was emphatic.Doyle asked discreetly.\u201cCan I ask you why?\u201d\u201cAs I said, I have something I need to do.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, you can still join us later after you take care of it\u2026.\u201dYeon-woo calmly shook his head.\u201cIn the first place, I\u2019m not really interested in being in a team. I don\u2019t like being tied up.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Okay.\u201dDoyle\u2019s shoulders dropped. He was so sad he almost looked like a puppy under the rain. Then Kahn came next to Doyle and patted him on the shoulder.\u201cWe can\u2019t help it. People have different personalities. It\u2019s not like we can force him to stay with us. And things like this are gonna happen more often once we get in The Tower. Anyway, you\u2019re still staying with us until we get out of here, right?\u201dYeon-woo nodded.Kahn gave a big laugh and turned towards the exit.\u201cThen let\u2019s go back out. People are waiting outside.\u201d* * *The northern swamp was very wide. It could take quite a lot of time to get out. There were also a lot of Lizardmen wandering around, so Yeon-woo decided to accompany them only until he got out of the swamp.The other players were dangling after the three of them. If they were separated from the party here, they were dead men. However, they kept a certain distance from the three. They all had witnessed the scene of Kahn oppressing Brend.Eventually, the players created a strange sight where they were too terrified to come close to Kahn and Doyle but had no choice but to follow them. Kahn and Doyle were also uncomfortable with their ambiguous attitude.\u201cWhat are you going to do now with those people?\u201dYeon-woo asked, taking a quick peek at the players behind.Kahn and Doyle also looked perplexed.Kahn sighed lightly.\u201cWell, we can\u2019t do anything about them for now. We\u2019ll have to escort them out of this swamp.\u201dAs a matter of fact, Kahn and Doyle also had a place to go, just like Yeon-woo.Since they got the Hargan\u2019s Crown they wanted, they didn\u2019t have any reason to hang around here any longer. The tutorial\u2019s remaining time was passing quickly.\u201cIt\u2019s not your duty to keep them safe.\u201d\u201cHey, I have a human heart, you know? How can I leave them here?\u201dKahn scowled at Yeon-woo, but Yeon-woo looked calm.A human heart. In the tutorial?There was something he had always felt was weird about them. On one hand they could be stern, but on the other hand they were too soft. They were too nice to other people. Sometimes that attitude could be poisonous. Not to mention, they were currently in a place where there were a lot of hyenas just looking for a chance to bite off their necks.Yeon-woo had a lot of advice he wanted to give them, but he decided not to because it was obvious that they wouldn\u2019t listen to his advice. Also, he was going to have to leave them soon.* * *It wasn\u2019t long before Yeon-woo\u2019s concerns turned out to be real.\u201cUhm, c, can you, uh, give me some food?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t much of a deal at first. All they did was to come hesitantly and beg for food. These people had been held captive and couldn\u2019t eat properly. Doyle apologized for not sharing the food in advance and he handed out some of the food he had.The player hugged the jerky he received tightly in his arms and returned to his seat. When the eyes of the other players gathered up on him, the player made eye contact with Ethan. The player then nodded silently. It was a cue to let him know his plan seemed feasible.\u2018Is that so?\u2019Ethan rolled up the corners of his mouth.In fact, it was Ethan\u2019s order that sent him to beg for food.\u2018I had a feeling when they tried to take care of this many people, but they are actually a couple of pushovers.\u2019In fact, the plan Ethan had presented to Brend was very simple.\u2018My teammates and I will make a scene in order to slow them down. And then, you will come forward and ask them for a break. Do you remember the place where three rocks are placed outside the swamp? Lead them that way.\u2019\u2018What\u2019s about next?\u2019\u2018The three of them must be exhausted from raiding Lizardman King, so I bet they aren\u2019t gonna say no. Then while we\u2019re on a break, he\u2019s going to make his move. And then\u2026 You know what happens after that, right?\u2019Their plan was to lure Yeon-woo\u2019s party to a designated location under the excuse of taking a break, and to catch Kahn and Doyle off guard to steal their items.\u2018Judging by what I\u2019ve observed, it\u2019s a perfectly feasible plan.\u2019Ethan\u2019s trait was \u2018Capture\u2019. His trait allowed him to infer other players\u2019 personalities and tendencies after observing their habits. Thanks to this trait, Ethan had been able to come up to Section E by only relying on his wits and words, even though he didn\u2019t have any special talent.And he had examined Kahn very closely when he was humiliating Brend. After that, he had figured out something from it. What Kahn valued the most was neither money nor honor, but \u2018loyalty\u2019.Each person has a different set values and different standards. And when people\u2019s values collide, they tend to believe that the values they pursue are the absolute \u2018justice\u2019.In Ethan\u2019s view, the loyalty Kahn and Doyle valued could be easily exploited. People like them often got caught up in their loyalty and ended up digging their own grave. They could have ignored the players or leave them after saving them. However, they were protecting the them merely out of the sense of responsibility. That was the evidence. He even disliked talking behind his teammate\u2019s back.\u2018In other words, if I don\u2019t cross the line, I can exploit them as much as I want.\u2019So Ethan sent his man to probe that line, and now he was getting the gist of it.\u2018No touching your loyalty or your pride, is it? Well, that\u2019s easy. Huhu.\u2019But there was something that had been nagging on his mind.\u2018If there\u2019s anything fishy about it, it\u2019s him.\u2019Ethan took a quick glance at the masked man who silently followed Kahn and Doyle. It was Yeon-woo.\u2018That guy\u2026 I can\u2019t tell anything no matter how hard I try.\u2019He was the one who was said to have made the most contribution in killing the Lizardman King. Even with that much skill, it was strange his name remained anonymous within the tutorial.Normally, there could be only one case. A person who doesn\u2019t reveal himself, has strict self-discipline, and knows how to calmly judge the situation.Ethan\u2019s trait did not show anything from him. Moreover, whenever he watched Yeon-woo with his minions to find out about him, whether it was a coincidence or not, Yeon-woo also turned his head his way and caught his eyes.Beneath the white mask, two eyes were coldly shining. He felt naked before the two floating Will-o\u2019-wisp-like eyes that seemed to be able to see right through him. They gave him chills all over his body.But that didn\u2019t stop Ethan\u2019s plan. No matter how suspicious he was, there was no way he could have noticed them plotting something.\u2018Brend, that idiot\u2019s gonna take the bullet and set the table for us.\u2019Ethan scoffed at how dumb Brend could be. In fact, the plan he had told Brend wasn\u2019t the end of it, it was only the first step. The real deal would happen right after that.Drawing their attention while his friend stole a little bit of their artifacts and Tokens? It was all a lie.\u2018Stealing isn\u2019t enough. They are Kahn and Doyle we\u2019re dealing with. The 3rd and the 11th ranks! And the other guy is the one who destroyed the Lizardman King. If I can take them all down\u2026 Taking the first place won\u2019t be just a dream.\u2019Ethan licked his lips, his eyes giving off a cruel look.The most important part of the plan was the finesse and timing. And the masked man would never get out of this trap either.Ethan then gave a signal to his minions.Some players suddenly began to throw tantrums.\u201cKahn, my friend is not feeling well right now\u2026.\u201d\u201cCan we slow down a little? I, I\u2019m getting really tired.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I need to use a bathroom.\u201dLater on, some people even started to lay down on the floor and refused to move..\u201cI\u2019m not going to move any more! I\u2019m not! I don\u2019t have anything right now. If I go out there, I\u2019ll just be monsters\u2019 food. Then, I\u2019d rather sit here all day!\u201dKahn and Doyle were slightly annoyed. They had a long way to go, but these players were dragging their feet down. No, it wasn\u2019t just dragging them. It was almost as if they were intentionally blocking their way. They were now more like shackles instead of burdens.Doyle looked at Kahn asking what should they do.Kahn frowned and sighed briefly.It wasn\u2019t like he couldn\u2019t understand them feeling hopeless towards their future, but he couldn\u2019t just indulge all of them. He even thought that it might be better to give away some of his Tokens and leave them here.It was at this moment,\u2018Now!\u2019Ethan immediately signaled Brend.Brend was the player who had taken the role of representing the others. If such a person stepped up and mediated, they might listen to him.Brend nodded and slowly approached Kahn.\u201cWell, I think the long captivity had them mentally tired. I realize you are busy, but I\u2019d really appreciate if we can take a break around here.\u201dKahn stopped walking and started to contemplate. Then, he looked back at Doyle and Yeon-woo and asked for their opinions.Ethan, watching from behind, gave a wicked grin.\u2018Come on now. I\u2019ve got lots of friends waiting for you to show up.\u2019It wasn\u2019t just a couple of players waiting in the vacant lot. Several troops with dozens of players in it. The scavengers were waiting inside.As soon as they enter the designated place, the traps would activate and Kahn and the rest of the party would fall into their hands.The moment when he licked his lips with a surge of greed.\u2018Huh?\u2019Ethan noticed there was someone staring at him, so he turned towards the direction he felt the gaze coming from. And there, he found a couple of eyes curved upward underneath the white mask.\u2018Is he\u2026 smiling?\u2019The moment when the thought came to his mind,\u2018We\u2019re bust\u2026!\u2019Ethan instinctively stepped backward. He didn\u2019t know how Yeon-woo had noticed him, but for now, he had to run away.However,*Swish*He saw something flashing right in front of him and,*Puck*As he felt a stinging pain right in the middle of his forehead, the whole world turned red.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Consume (6)Ethan fell backwards as blood sprinkled out from his head. It happened in less than no time.\u201cAaaah!\u201d\u201cWha, what\u2019s going on!\u201dThe players panicked over the sudden situation.Kahn and Doyle, who had been talking to Brend, also hurriedly turned their eyes towards the scene. But regardless of the disturbance, Yeon-woo fixed his grasp on Carshina\u2019s Dagger and dashed forward. His targets were the players Ethan kept close to himself.\u201cHow the hell did he\u2026?They were surprised at the fact that their cover was blown, but at the same time, they dispersed in all directions in order to make their escape.\u2018How naive.\u2019Yeon-woo laughed at how the players were all running away after just a light push.In fact, Yeon-woo had noticed their plan not long after they started to execute it. He always kept his senses strengthened in a passive state. Thanks to this, he was able to detect even the slightest changes in his surroundings. Like this, if there was anything suspicious, his instincts would warn him immediately. And that was what happened this time.His senses had been capturing every movement of the players who were following Yeon-woo\u2019s party. Even their words and their actions. And then his senses had caught Ethan. The look he had when he examined the three of them. The attitude he showed when he gave orders to some of the players. And the way he talked to Brend while avoiding other player\u2019s eyes. In his own conceit, he thought he was acting in secret. But foolishly enough, his actions were only raising Yeon-woo\u2019s suspicion.Since then, Yeon-woo had expanded his senses, just to be on the safe side. Then, he realized that an unidentified group of players was preparing for an ambush in a vacant lot not far away. That could only mean one thing.\u201cScavengers.\u201dIt meant that the players who they had thought to be Hargan\u2019s victims were actually more wicked than the Lizardmen. So Yeon-woo eliminated Ethan as soon as he showed signs of taking action.\u2018I have to strike them first before they can make their move.\u2019Judging by the number of players hiding, there were more than the three of them could handle. It seemed like they have gathered all the scavengers around this region.He didn\u2019t know how Ethan gave signals to the other hiding scavengers, but he needed to kill them before they could prepare. In any case, despite their efforts to run away, they still hadn\u2019t escaped Yeon-woo\u2019s sensory area.In his running gait, Yeon-woo drew several daggers.*Swish*And then he threw them in a fan shape.*Puck*The fleeing scavengers fell flat on their faces with a dagger stuck in their heads or their backs. Only two of them, who were more skilled than the others, managed to deflect his daggers and run away.When Yeon-woo was about to chase after the scavengers he missed,\u201cDude! What the hell are you doing?\u201dKahn stood in his way with a startled look. In his eyes, it seemed like Yeon-woo was slaughtering innocent players all of a sudden.Yeon-woo replied with a callous voice.\u201cStop acting like a fool and take a look around you.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cIf you still don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening, then just shut your mouth and stay out of my way.\u201dWith those words said, Yeon-woo quickly brushed past Kahn\u2019s side.*Swish*Kahn tried to shout at him one more time but soon realized something was wrong and took a quick look around. Doyle, who was already aware of the situation, was concentrating his mana onto his hand.\u201cHyung.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting anything like this. Damn it!\u201dKahn creased his brows and drew a sword from his waist. Before he knew it, they had been surrounded by a group of players. Each of them took out a sword or an axe from who knows where, emitting a murderous atmosphere. Brend was the only one who couldn\u2019t figure out the whole situation. He stammered over his words.\u201cWha, what\u2019s going on? Whe, where did you get those weap\u2026 Kuk!\u201dA player beside him, as if he didn\u2019t want to bother telling him, frowned at his question and chopped Brend\u2019s face off with his hatchet.\u201cYou fell for our trap like an idiot, that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. Pthu! This is why you were trapped in the human farm.\u201dMany \u2018normal\u2019 players had already fallen dead after being attacked by the players who they had considered to be allies. Just like Brend, they were players who had not understood the quick turn of events.The remaining players, or scavengers, talked among themselves.\u201cIt was almost done, though. How the hell did we get caught?\u201d\u201cHow do you think we got caught? Obviously, it was Ethan, that stupid bastard got caught.\u201d\u201cThat idiot.\u201d\u201cQuit whining and get ready. These guys, they\u2019re dangerous. We\u2019ll have to hold out until they bring backup.\u201d\u201cWell, good thing one of them went after them. Hopefully, they will take care of that guy.\u201dThese players were the ones who had killed Hargan on his second phase. Facing such strong players, the scavengers had to enter the battle with complete concentration. But they didn\u2019t seem to think they were going to lose. Yeon-woo and others should already be tired from the big battle, and they would be far outnumbering Yeon-woo\u2019s party after their reinforcement joined them. They even had some top rankers on their side.\u201cWho the hell are these guys?\u201dKahn gave an annoyed frown while he gathered up his mana.* * *\u2018They must be the original owners of the human farm.\u2019Yeon-woo was able to extrapolate their identity as he closely followed them.Not all scavengers were mere looters, some of them joined hands with monsters.\u2018As a bait, these scavengers pretend to be hurt and ask nearby players for help to lure them into the trap. When they succeed, they give the human meat to the monsters, and they take the artifacts and Tokens for themselves.\u201dWhen we found out that the owners of a human farm providing human flesh to monsters were, in fact, human beings just like us, our team was furious at their vicious acts.And we swore to ourselves.That we\u2019d wipe those villains out of the tutorials and The Tower!\u2018He said that the scavengers who provided human meat to monsters were known as the worst kind of scavengers that existed in the tutorial. But rooting these criminals out of the tutorial was a formidable task because their organization not only was huge, but it also had the king of monsters watching their back.\u2019If they intended to hide, they could conceal themselves anywhere in Section E. So whenever they had pursuers, they called out monsters to fight off the players and they themselves ran away to hide.Nevertheless, his brother and Arthia was relentless in their pursuit. In the end, they were able to wipe out all the scavengers and completely destroy the organization to prevent their resurgence.He had been able to rank second place thanks to the achievement he made at that time, it had been an audacious decision and a remarkable deed. Even after that, he checked the tutorial every once in a while to make sure crimes like the human farm could never recur.Supposedly, they were gone for good, because his brother said they never reappeared ever again. That was why Yeon-woo only kept it as a piece of information without worrying about it.\u2018But you\u2019re back again?\u2019He didn\u2019t know whether they were copycats, or they were the remaining players who had remained hidden until Arthia was gone. But there were two things he could tell for sure. One was the fact that the same crime was happening right now, and the other was that they tried to corner him into their trap.\u2018The players who were originally trapped in the farm\u2026 have probably already been killed.\u2019Yeon-woo shone coldly in his eyes.Although he had once made a cold-hearted decision back when he had found the human farm, he was still a human just like anyone else. The idea of selling his own kind to monsters was just utterly incomprehensible.\u201cThey even tried to make the most of it by leaving their ally, Hargan, to die. They\u2019re not someone I can take lightly. Before they can notice the situation here, I\u2019ll have to counter-ambush them and get rid of them as soon as possible.\u201dAnd as expected, these scavengers were doing their job in leading him to their reinforcement. He hadn\u2019t caught the fleeing scavengers on purpose in order to pinpoint the place where the rest were hiding.And the moment he sensed their position,*Swish*\u201cKuk!\u201d\u201cNo\u2026no!\u201dYeon-woo threw daggers at the now useless players before plunging into the grassy field.\u201cThey should be showing up any time now. Why aren\u2019t they com\u2026 Kuk!\u201dInside one of the bushes, a scavenger was muttering to himself while crouching down. But soon, he was stopped by a sudden searing pain in the back of his neck.He tried to raise his head up, but before he could even scream, his head had already been separated from his neck and dropped rolling on the floor. A puddle of blood formed on the ground.*Plop*After a simple splash from stepping on the puddle, not a single noise was made as Yeon-woo moved on to the next point. It was like a feline trying to hunt down its prey.\u2018Secretly, but swiftly.\u2019*Pat*A pair of Will-o\u2019-wisp were darting across the woods.* * *It took a long time before the scavengers waiting for Ethan realized something was wrong.\u2013 Fuck! What\u2019s taking him so long?\u2013 No kidding. Did he get caught or something?\u2013 He\u2019s brought small fries before, but he\u2019s never got caught, has he?\u2013 That\u2019s true but, shit. I\u2019m just fucking bored.When the scavengers were on their \u2018mission\u2019, they usually wore a piece of cloth to cover up their faces, and called themselves with numbers such as Eins, Zwei, Drei, etc. It was a measure to prevent giving out their identities when confronting enemies.A long time ago when the whole criminal syndicate was on the brink of annihilation, the remaining players adopted this method to conceal themselves from Arthia, or that was what they heard from senior players. And even after Arthia\u2019s disappearance, it stuck around and became sort of a custom, still being practiced until now.Unlike how their seniors used to keep their identities secret even between themselves, the scavengers at the current time knew each other. But by covering up their faces and names, they could somewhat erase the guilt of \u2018doing bad things\u2019.Strangely, however, they weren\u2019t getting any notice from Dreisig, or Ethan, who was supposed to be here with their prey by now. They were still waiting for their prey to appear.\u2013 Huhu. The real Blood Sword and Foxy Tail. If we can actually hunt them down, wouldn\u2019t they be the biggest catch we\u2019ve ever had?\u2013 Except for Phante and Edora, those crazy siblings, they\u2019re actually the best team in the tutorial right now. It\u2019s going to be really fun destroying such strong players. Not to mention the stuff they\u2019re carrying.\u2013 The sword that Blood Sword is carrying, Dragon Slayer(\u5c60\u9f8d\u528d), was it? That\u2019s mine.\u2013 The hell? I called dibs way before, you dumbass!\u2013 Whatever you say. But finders keepers.\u2013 You two, knock it off. The boss will take care of the distribution, so stop squabbling. Let\u2019s just talk about something useful, like how to spend the rewards from the Lizardman King.After some cackling and chattering, they lifted their heads.\u2013 Damn, he\u2019s taking really long. I think something\u2019s happened there. Siebzehn, try contacting Ethan.Zwei grumbled and gave orders to Siebzehn who was hiding in the bushes some distance away from to him.The communication artifact commonly given to all scavengers was emitting light, waiting for a response. But no answer came back.\u2013 Siebzehn? Siebzehn! Where the hell did he go?Zwei knitted his brows and turned his head sideways.\u2013 Neun, is Siebzehn there? You go ahead and contact him.\u2013 \u2026.\u2013 Neun? Neun!Neun, who had just been arguing over Dragon Slayer with Zwei, gave no response either.Zwei suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. His teammates had been going missing without him knowing. Which could only mean\u2026\u2018We are being attacked!\u2019Zwei sprang up to his feet.Zwei placed 15th in tutorial rankings. And he prided himself in his skills, saying they were comparable to those in the top 10. But a player such as himself hadn\u2019t been able to notice the enemy\u2019s presence until all of his teammates had already died. The stealthiness the enemy possessed was beyond his imagination.Just then,*Rustle*\u201cWhere the fuck are you?\u201dZwei quickly turned towards the direction from where he heard a sound coming from. There, however, he only found bushes swaying with the wind. No player to be found.\u201cYou son of a bitch!\u201dOnce more, he turned to his back as soon as he heard another sound. And again, there was no one.Zwei frowned irritatedly.\u201cI see you don\u2019t have guts to fight me head-on. If you\u2019re trying to break my fighting spirit by doing this, it won\u2019t work.\u201dHe was talking to himself with his teeth gritted. It was more of a self-hypnosis than a threat.The more sounds he heard, and the stronger the wind became, the more intense the chills that ran through his spine grew. Fear was rising from under his feet and it was slowly squeezing his heart. His mind was filled with a single desire, that was to quickly kill him and to get out of there.*Rustle*He spotted a presence coming from his blind spot.Zwei quickly threw the sword he was holding.*Puck*\u2018I got him!\u2019He clearly heard his sword hitting something.Zwei immediately threw himself in that direction. But instead of his enemy, he only found one of his teammates, Vier, panting for air with a sword stuck in his heart.Vier\u2019s face was so pale and filled with one clear emotion.It was fear.\u201cR, run\u2026 Gho\u2026 st!\u201dAnd Vier dropped his head, leaving only those words behind.Zwei felt that the fear that had only been squeezing his heart had already climbed up to his throat. At that moment, a white mask dropped down in front of Zwei. Along with terror, despair, and then, death.*Shluk** * *Khan and Doyle were still having a tense confrontation.\u201cWhat the hell is Arangdan doing?\u201dKhan felt a surge of anger.Arangdan professed themselves as a vigilante group. But they didn\u2019t know that crimes like this were prevalent in Section E.On a second thought, he wondered about Yeon-woo. He was currently on his way to catch the fleeing scavengers. He couldn\u2019t have shown such fast judgement unless he knew about them beforehand. But how on earth did he know these facts that even Arangdan didn\u2019t know?His question, however, did not last long. The scavenger who identified himself as Eins was making his move, and the other players were also slowly narrowing the distance between them.The moment he tried to clear a path with Doyle,*Whistle*\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cEnemy? Ally?\u201dSuddenly a presence was heard from the sky.All the players, including Kahn, Doyle, and Eins, stopped moving and raised their heads.*Fa-thud*A bunch of unknown objects fell from the sky. Then one of them came rolling towards Eins\u2019 toe.\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201dAs Eins narrowed his eyes to confirm what it was, he soon stood frozen to the spot with his mouth agape.The object that had rolled next to his feet.It was the head of Zwei, his face filled with fear.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Consume (7)\u201cZwei!\u201dThe numbers in their names represented their rank within the organization. The fact that the second strongest Zwei had been killed like this\u2026!\u201cVier!\u201d\u201cNeun! What the hell happened\u2026\u201d\u201cStay away, idiots! You\u2019re gonna get yourselves ki\u2026\u201dSome of the scavengers were deeply shocked by the sight of their teammate\u2019s decapitated heads. Eins tried to warn the other scavengers, but it was already too late.*Swish*A blade suddenly dropped down from the sky next to Eins. And there, he found Zehn with his hands grabbing tightly onto his throat.*Gurgle*But soon, he collapsed on the floor frothing at his mouth. And on that spot where Zehn had been standing, now stood Yeon-woo with a cold smile underneath his white mask.*Splash*\u201cKuk!\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201dYeon-woo then swung his arm and scattered several daggers in a fan shape towards the other scavengers.The daggers plucked into the scavengers necks. They firmly clutched their wounds in an effort to stop the bleeding, but soon they ended up collapsing as their blood sprayed all over the floor. The remaining scavengers finally came to their senses and stepped forward to kill Yeon-woo.However,Kahn and Doyle, who had been looking for an opportunity, sprang forward.In a situation where their formation had been broken, and with the two people\u2019s offensive being added into the mix, the scavengers were literally being swept away.\u201cStop those three! Do whatever you can to stop them!\u201dIn his fright, Eins yelled at the top of his lungs. But from the moment their siege had turned into a melee, they had little chances of winning the battle. Yeon-woo was dashing from scavenger to scavenger just like a wolf killing a flock of sheep. Swords were swung from every direction, but none of them could deceive Yeon-woo\u2019s senses.Yeon-woo skillfully dodged the attacks as if he had eyes everywhere, he held his dagger backward while stabbing at his opponents\u2019 muscles and arteries, and threw several daggers that penetrated their necks.Kahn and Doyle were just as fierce as Yeon-woo. Doyle quickly slid to a side as he summoned a series of flamebugs. Then, he made them explode in the middle of a group of scavengers, wreaking chaos in the battlefield. Kahn, on the other hand, was fighting amid the enemy lines. Streams of blood splashed up whenever he wielded his sword, as if to show why he was called Blood Sword.The scene they created felt like a city being engulfed by a tidal wave. Now, the scavengers position was reversed. From the predators, into the preys\u201cYou sons of bitches\u2026!\u201dEins struggled as hard as he could in order to turn the situation around. But before he knew it, Kahn was already right in front of his face. He hurriedly swung his sword from the shock.Without missing the chance, Kahn wielded his sword aiming for Eins\u2019 neck*Shluk*And his head fell on the floor.* \u00a0\u00a0 * \u00a0\u00a0 *The scavengers collapsed as quickly as the initial shock they had created with their appearance. Their awaited backup showed up dead, and their leader, Eins, also died a sudden death. Their morale hit rock bottom.Eventually, the scavengers abandoned their weapons one by one and began to surrender, knowing that they had no chance of winning.\u201cI, I surrender! Please, d, don\u2019t kill me!\u201d\u201cWe were just forced to do what Eins told us to do. Believe me!\u201d\u201cY, yeah he\u2019s right! We had no choice but to take part in order to survive! B, but I\u2019ve never killed any player, so please, spare me\u2026!\u201dThey wanted to bet on Kahn\u2019s and Doyle\u2019s compassion. They had seen, how Kahn and Doyle had tried to take responsibility for the slaves even though they weren\u2019t acquainted with them. Based on this, they thought that Kahn and Doyle might spare their lives if they put down their weapon and surrendered.However,\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between you and Hargan?\u201dKahn looked at the kneeling players and inquired coldly.\u201cW, what?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking what makes you different from Hargan who consumed his own kind, shitheads!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 Kuk!\u201dKahn relentlessly stuck his sword into their throats.The scavengers then realized who they had messed with. They had thought he was still green, but the player they were dealing with was the Blood Sword. A swordsman who was born as the son of a ranker in The Tower but had made his own name without riding on his father\u2019s coattail.They should have known that such a person would not be swayed by mere compassion.\u201cHargan at least cried when he saw his wife and his babies dead. But what about you? You must have been laughing all the while you sold other players to the monsters! And you even murdered the rest of the trapped players!\u201dIn the end, seeing that it was dangerous to stay any longer, the scavengers began to run away one by one. There was a great risk of falling prey to the Lizardmen by escaping unarmed into the swamp area. But they couldn\u2019t afford to think that far ahead.However, escaping wasn\u2019t going to be so easy.Just like when Yeon-woo eliminated their reinforcement, he was now hunting them from the shadows. Eventually and for a long time, horrible screams echoed around the forest. By the time the heavy smell of blood drifted with the wind, all the scavengers had already disappeared.*Tak*Yeon-woo returned after getting rid of the last remaining scavenger, and there, he saw Kahn and Doyle sitting down deep in sorrow.They had thought they had rescued the people who had been trapped by the Lizardman King. But the slaves were, in fact, all dead, and the only ones left were the scavengers trying to kill them. It must have been a tremendous shock.Yeon-woo didn\u2019t say a word. Unlike himself, who had experienced this kind of things many times in Africa, this must have been the first time for them.There will be apprehension towards humans, and there will be anger towards those who did this. In times like this, with all these kinds of emotions stirring their minds, no consolation would help them. The only thing he could do was to wait for them to organize their thoughts and stand on their own two feet.\u2018After that, people usually fall into one of two cases. Either they go crazy or they let it go.\u2019In the meantime, Yeon-woo wiped the blood off of Carshina\u2019s Dagger with a cloth and stuck it next to his waist.Kahn then looked at Yeon-woo with an indifferent stare.\u201cHow come you\u2019re so calm after this?\u201d\u201cI got used to it.\u201d\u201cI have no idea\u2026 what kind of life you might have lived. What about other people in your world, are they just like you?\u201dYeon-woo shrugged his shoulders.\u201cIf they were, the whole world would have gone mad.\u201dKahn, as if he was exhausted, lightly rubbed his eyes with his index finger and thumb. Then, he swept his face with his hands and looked at Yeon-woo with a serious look.\u201cCan I be honest?\u201dYeon-woo nodded calmly. He had a rough idea about what he was going to say.\u201cThese crazy bastards who had been pretending to be victims got us shocked but\u2026 Truth be told, both of us are a little scared of you too.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand how you can remain cool in a situation like this. I can\u2019t help but think that you were suspicious of them from the beginning.\u201dKahn\u2019s expression was sunken.\u201cYou\u2019ve never trusted anyone from the start, have you?\u201d\u2018And that includes us too.\u2019Kahn only kept the latter words in his mind, but Yeon-woo knew where Kahn was going with his words.\u2018I guess it\u2019s time to leave.\u2019Yeon-woo thought now was the time to part with them.Yeon-woo never trusted anyone from this world, Kahn and Doyle wanted to establish their team\u2019s relationship based on trust. Their relationship was bound to break apart. Especially Kahn and Doyle, who wanted to open up their minds to Yeon-woo, would be hurt to find out that Yeon-woo only considered them as mere business partners.Yeon-woo felt a little bitter aftertaste. Even being how he is, he didn\u2019t consider them as complete strangers.The cheerful Kahn and the warm-hearted Doyle. They both had such a big charm to them. However, they had their own perspective, and Yeon-woo had his own. If things didn\u2019t match, they had to break up.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201dAnd with a short farewell, Yeon-woo left on his own.Doyle stepped forward as if he wanted to say something, but Kahn reached out and blocked him.And just like that, they parted ways.* \u00a0\u00a0 * \u00a0\u00a0 *\u201cHyung! What have you done!\u201dWith a sad look, Doyle watched as Yeon-woo disappeared, then looked back at Kahn and shouted.Doyle usually didn\u2019t show much emotion, but right now, he was showing genuine anger. Behind Yeon-woo\u2019s back, Doyle had seen \u2018something\u2019 indescribable.However,\u201cSit down.\u201d\u201cTell me! Why did you do that? Even if we had to part, you know how much Cain\u2026\u201d\u201cI told you, sit down.\u201dKahn said in a low, serious voice.Doyle then came to his senses. He noticed something strange about Kahn\u2019s voice. His deep set eyes were looking serious.\u201cIt\u2019s for the best.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026!\u201d\u201cDid you not see this?\u201dKahn pointed to one of the swords dropped by a dead scavenger. It was just a normal sword one could easily purchase from a mysterious merchant with two Strength points.When Doyle was about to ask what was he talking about, he then found out a thread hanging from the tip of the sword. White and green threads were tied in a unique pattern.Doyle\u2019s voice trembled slightly.\u201cWait, is that\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s Arangdan\u2019s mark.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dDoyle\u2019s face was getting stiff.\u201cActually, I thought it was a little strange. Why would Arangdan or Cheonghwado go out of their way and try to keep the tutorial in order? \u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cThey mades excuses saying it was to procure an influx of new players, but people like us know that\u2019s a load of crap.\u201dThe ones behind Arlandan\u2019s back, Cheonghwado, was one of the ten biggest clans within The Tower. Their clan valued chivalry and worshiped swordsmanship and gallantry. Naturally, they always had plenty of applicants without having to put any effort into attracting newbies, and they could admit whoever they needed.When Cheonghwado had announced the establishment of Arangdan in order to watch over the tutorial, other clans and rankers had doubted their intentions. But without any solid proof, they could do nothing but let them be.What if it was, in fact, a cover to secretly take over the scavengers?\u201cThe tutorial runs via a series of complex systems that differ from those present in The Tower. I don\u2019t know exactly what they\u2019re after, but if they are trying to take advantage of the system\u2026.\u201dKahn had to pause as he clenched his teeth. He was holding back the burning anger welling up inside him.\u201cThen, their story finally adds up. Right?\u201dDoyle nodded his head in silence.\u201cCome to think of it\u2026 The foundation of Arangdan came suddenly right after Arthia had wiped out all of the scavengers in the tutorial.\u201d\u201cThey probably needed a more solid management system.\u201dDoyle gritted his teeth. He finally understood why Kahn had to send Yeon-woo away with a ridiculous excuse. He didn\u2019t want to drag Yeon-woo into the risk that was about to follow as he seemed to have important businesses to attend to. Kahn must not have wanted to disturb him.\u201cHyung, then are you\u2026.\u201dKahn nodded gravely.\u201cYes. I\u2019m gonna have to go see that idiot Bild before I can carry on. You should go ahead and head to where \u2018Vigridr\u2019 is.\u201dVigridr.It was the other hidden piece that required Kahn and Doyle to obtain Hargan\u2019s Crown beforehand. It was the ultimate goal they hoped to achieve in the tutorial. It was also the only way Kahn and Doyle could catch up with the Edora and Phante siblings who had been stacking up Karma points with incredible speed.\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, hyung.\u201dDoyle had a big smile on his face.\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who wants to see those bastards\u2019 faces. I\u2019m dying to know what he\u2019s going to say about this.\u201dHe had also decided to abandon their chance.Kahn shook his head as if knowing that would be his answer.\u201cYou know, I think you\u2019re the dumbest one there is. I mean, you pretend to be smart and all, but in the end, you end up making the dumbest decision.\u201d\u201cLook at who\u2019s talking.\u201dJust as always, Kahn and Doyle giggled as they joked with each other.And now, they set their feet towards the opposite direction of Yeon-woo\u2019s. The direction that lead towards the western territory where Arangdan was known to be stationed.* \u00a0\u00a0 * \u00a0\u00a0 *Yeon-woo stopped for a moment and shifted his gaze towards the west.\u2018\u2026Idiots.\u2019Yeon-woo had a vague notion as to where the two were heading to. And their thoughts behind such a sudden farewell. But he had to go east. The was something he had to do. If it wasn\u2019t now, there would never be a second chance.However,If they had asked him to come with them before he left, if they had asked him for help. Could he still have refused them?Without having a proper answer, Yeon-woo continued to move eastward.To the place where the hidden piece, Akasha\u2019s Snake, was.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Akasha\u2019s Snake (1)Bild\u2019s brows trembled.\u201cTeam 2 was\u2026 annihilated?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201dTeam 2 was in charge of supporting Arangdan from \u2018behind the scenes\u2019 by supplying them with \u2018materials\u2019.\u201cIt must be them again.\u201dThe subordinate lowered his head without replying, but that was enough for an answer.Bild continued with a seemingly irritated voice.\u201cYou said they were enough for this task so I gave you the chance, but you failed me. Ha! It\u2019s as if we just let them take Hargan\u2019s Crown for free.\u201dThe subordinate kept his head low while bowing. He knew that making excuses in this situation would just make his problems worse.It was only two days ago when Bild had ordered Team 2, the scavenger troop, to get rid of Yeon-woo\u2019s team.Arangdan had brought a piece of information saying that the three of them had immediately headed towards Hargan\u2019s Lair as soon as they entered Section E. For that reason, he had set up a trap.However, contrary to expectations, they managed to exterminate every last one of the scavengers that participated on the mission. Including both the baits and the backups.Not only that, but they had also taken Hargan\u2019s Crown, which Bild was saving for the end of the tutorial.It was quite gut-wrenching for Bild.\u201cYou fools. Do I have to step up for a task like this?\u201d\u201cI, I\u2019m terribly sorry.\u201dHe had put a lot of work into preparing Team 2, but now his efforts had ended up being in vain. He couldn\u2019t let them get away with this.If he left this matter unsettled, it was clear that there would be a punishment coming from \u2018the Isle\u2019.\u201cPut Team 1 on standby.\u201d\u201cY, you mean the \u2018Team 1\u2019?\u201dThe subordinate opened his eyes in surprise.Team 1. The players in this team were known as the elite players in Arangdan, and were being specially trained for Cheonghwado. Each one of them was among the top rankers in the tutorial.But what surprised him the most was that this was the first time Bild had ordered to assemble the whole team. And all of that just to deal with three people? To him, it seemed like a waste.\u201cThey\u2019re the ones who destroyed Team 2 with only three of them. Blood Sword, Foxy Tail, and the masked one. Their level is higher than I expected.\u201dBild leaned back on the chair.\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad. This will serve as a good combat experience for them.\u201dThe subordinate bowed his head in agreement. Even from his point of view, the players in Team 1 were all full of conceit. Their belief in that they would be the next leading players of Cheonghwado was so strong that even Bild\u2019s words were often ignored.Bild was planning to make use of this opportunity for both getting rid of the eyesores, and throwing a damper on their pride.\u201cAnd, I will be moving along with them.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe subordinate\u2019s eyes widened, but he soon lowered his head again.Prior to becoming an executive in Arangdan, he was also a player who had climbed some floors in The Tower.No matter how good players were in the tutorial, there was a huge gap between them and players already in The Tower.\u2018Those high rankers are dead now.\u2019He clicked his tongue in pity.Players from The Tower would receive a severe penalty from the guardian if they intervened in the tutorial. But Bild decided to step up even at the risk of receiving such penalty. That\u2019s how much of an obstacle they posed to him.\u201cOr\u2026 are you considering the possibility of them having noticed the identity of Team 2?\u201dBild slowly nodded his head.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to leave a potential risk behind. Besides, we can\u2019t let them get away with what they have done to us, can we?\u201dBild then gave him an order as he bent his brows.\u201cImmediately assemble all members of Team 1. And also, warn them that those who fail to comply will be cut off from the clan on the spot.\u201d\u201cRoger.\u201dBild clicked his tongue as he watched the subordinate leave.\u201cWe were almost done collecting the sacrifices. I didn\u2019t expect a setback in our plan.\u201dWhen he had first heard of what happened to Kaen, Bild had thought he could easily run Yeon-woo off the road. But now, he couldn\u2019t just stand by after all the trouble Yeon-woo had caused.\u2018Still, \u00a0Blood Sword and Foxy Tail, their backgrounds are too big. There\u2019s also the possibility of the masked guy being secretly raised by other clans. He must have someone\u2019s backing.\u2019Bild had already excluded the possibility of Yeon-woo being alone. As far as he knew, no player with that level of ability could have been raised without any support.Bild couldn\u2019t look down on his ability to clear the \u2018Inner Area\u2019 as a solo player, even going as far as speedrunning it. So he had to get rid of them as secretly as possible, leaving no evidence behind.Of course, it wasn\u2019t because he was afraid of their background. The power Cheonghwado had in The Tower was really unmatched. It was only because he didn\u2019t want to arouse any suspicion from other clans or rankers.\u2018After the downfall of Arthia, the forced peace in The Tower is now gradually being chiseled away. Now, it\u2019s just like a ticking time bomb. You never know when it\u2019s going to explode. But at least before it explodes, we have to gather up as much strength as we can.\u2019Secretly, and without anyone noticing, Arangdan was in charge of supplying the necessary materials to gather up their strength.On that account, Bild couldn\u2019t forgive Yeon-woo\u2019s party for destroying Team 2.Bild thought for a moment about how to eliminate them.However, his thoughts did not last long.*Kwang*\u201cWe\u2019re under attack!\u201d\u201cDamn it! What the hell is going on!\u201dAn explosion shook the whole command post violently.The noise came from the entrance.\u201cB, Bild!\u201dThen the subordinate, who had been ordered to gather up Team 1, rushed back into his room.Bild asked with a frown on his face.\u201cWhat just happened outside?\u201d\u201cTh, they\u2019re here!\u201d\u201cThey?\u201d\u201cBlood Sword and Foxy Tail\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dBild rose from his seat with an irritated look.Before the subordinate could continue, Bild spoke with a curl on his lips\u201cThey\u2019ve saved me some trouble now that they came here on their own.\u201dJust then,*Kwang*Suddenly, the wall to his left was blasted off and Kahn appeared along with Doyle. As if they had clove their way straight across, they were covered in dust and blood.\u201cBild!\u201dKahn burst into a rage with a distorted expression while looking at the man who had turned the tutorial into hell,*Rumble*Murderous aura raved through the room like a windstorm.\u201cKuk!\u201d\u201cWaaak!\u201dSome clan members had ran into the room chasing after the two players, but most of them were blown away by his aura, and those who weren\u2019t still spilt blood and fainted.The floor was quaking up and down, and the room was reeking of blood.Kahn drenched in blood and with his blood-soaked Dragon Slayer gave the impression of a demon straight out of hell. This was the \u2018true\u2019 form of Blood Sword that had drawn the attention from various clans and rankers in The Tower.Bild slowly drew his sword, unveiling his murderous aura. He felt a tingling sensation all over his body. But even so, the sneer on Bild\u2019s face grew bigger and bigger.\u201cI was getting bored stuck in the tutorial. Let\u2019s enjoy ourselves, son of the Iron Lion.\u201dAt the end of his words,*Kwang*Bild and Kahn flung themselves at each other.Once again, another explosion erupted inside the room.* \u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0 *While Bild and Kahn were fighting each other, Yeon-woo was reaching the eastern area of Section E.The lush forest soon came to an end, and the black rocky mountains started to show their spiky heads.A wide and barren desert. It was the Orcs\u2019 territory.Orcs are monsters that possess a solid physique and muscles with a grimly twisted pig face. They are two meters in size, which is bigger than a Lizardman. Orcs show aggressive behavior towards players, they will run to attack a player as soon as they spot one. This kind of behavior makes it harder for players to hunt them down.But of course, that did not matter to Yeon-woo even a bit. As he ventured around the eastern desert, four Orcs suddenly jumped at him during their patrol.*Puck*But Yeon-woo easily sliced off the gullets of three of the Orcs, and severed the arm and leg muscles of the remaining one and laid him on the floor.Then he climbed on his body and held a dagger against his neck.\u201cChwik! H, human! Strong! S, spare me!\u201dPlayers and monsters were alike, they all begged for their lives when facing imminent death.Yeon-woo asked the Orc with a cold smile on his face.\u201cI kept you alive because you seemed the smartest of all.\u201d\u201cR, right! Chwik! I, am the smartest, in the tribe! Chwik!\u201dOrc intensely nodded his head with a pale look.But the truth was, Yeon-woo randomly picked one out of the four Orcs.\u201cLet me ask you a question. Have you seen any cottage nearby? It should be somewhere on the rocky mountain or on the branches of a tree.\u201d\u201cW, what? Chwik.\u201d\u201cYou better think hard. There are lots of other Orcs around that I can ask.\u201dThe Orc then quickly put his brain to work. To survive, he had to remember things in great detail, like what he had eaten five days ago.The cold blade of the dagger started to slice into the skin on his neck. Blood was dripping out of the wound, but the Orc was too terrified to feel the pain on his throat.Soon enough, the Orc managed to conjure up a memory he had regarding a house.\u201cTh, there is one! Chwik! I have never seen it! But my friends were scouting, and they saw a strange house, hanging on the Baotri! But they said, it was too high, so they just came back!\u201dBeneath the mask, Yeon-woo\u2019s eyes shone brightly.\u2018This must be it.\u2019It was the place where the helper who would lead him to the hidden piece, Akasha\u2019s Snake, lived.\u201cAnd where is that?\u201dThe Orc realized that the dagger had stopped digging into his throat, so he quickly answered.\u201cYou have to walk, a little bit left to the sunrise, takes two meals of time.\u201d\u2018Northeast, about half a day from here.\u2019The Orc then shouted urgently.\u201cL, let me g\u2026 Kuk!\u201dBut he couldn\u2019t finish his words.The dagger penetrated deeply into his neck and cut off his artery.\u201cWh, why\u2026?\u201dWith his life fading away, the Orc spat out one last word with the intention to ask why had he killed him despite having answered his question.\u201cI was only asking you a question, and I didn\u2019t say I was going to let you live.\u201dHearing Yeon-woo\u2019s cold reply, the Orc was left in shock as he wheezed out his last breath.Yeon-woo immediately took out a dagger and began to cut the dead orcs\u2019 stomachs open. It was to take their ribs.Orcs\u2019 bones were very high in density. They were perfect materials for crafting various artifacts.As he dissected the carcasses, Yeon-woo meticulously mapped out his future plans.\u2018Akasha\u2019s Snake is a tricky monster. It only shows up at certain times, under certain conditions and circumstances. Without his help, I\u2019ll never be able to find it.\u2019Akasha\u2019s Snake was a monster that inhabit deep down under the ground in the eastern desert area. But unlike its name, it was not an ordinary snake.It was a predator that could swallow and devour everything.His brother had left various records about Akasha\u2019s Snake in his diary. Not just because that was how shocked he had been when he had first faced Akasha\u2019s Snake, but also because it was the experience that had helped Arthia become who they were. Yeon-woo was thinking of killing such monster \u2018on his own\u2019.Its size was larger than the four or five rocky mountains combined, and its length was immeasurably long. I even wondered how could a monster like that exist in the tutorial.It was said that Akasha\u2019s Snake sometimes had to come out to the surface in order to breathe. It also filled its hungry stomach while it stayed on the surface.We tried to kill such monster without having any knowledge about it. No wonder we almost lost our fight. But luckily, we met him.The person who saved his brother and Arthia during their battle with the snake.My first master, Galliard.\u2018Snake hunter, Galliard.\u201dYeon-woo muttered the name of the person he should be meeting soon.Of course, if he knew I was calling him with cheesy words like master, he\u2019d be come running here to punch me in the face.Anyway, he was a man who seemed to be ever so free but was imprisoned by memories of the past.That\u2019s the reason he had been hunting Akasha\u2019s Snake for decades.Galliard had a rather unique history.He was a player.However he had never stepped into The Tower. For decades, he had only stayed in the tutorial that resets every round.But it wasn\u2019t because he wasn\u2019t weak. Later on, when his brother looked back after becoming the sixth top ranker in The Tower, Gilliard had never been weaker than the other rankers. He even presumed he could be among the top rankers. If he had left the tutorial and tried to climb the tower\u2026 Perhaps Galliard could have climbed higher than his brother.His brother felt it was a waste to have a player with such great skill stuck in the tutorial.Galliard just didn\u2019t have any reputation in The Tower, but he knew what Galliard would be capable of. So he used pass tickets to try to convince him over and over again, but Galliar refused everytime. When his brother asked for the reason, he never gave him a proper answer. He could only guess that Galliard was trapped by a regretful memory that involved Akasha\u2019s Snake, and that the memory was holding him from leaving the tutorial.\u2018Jeong-woo was able to find Akasha\u2019s Snake with the help of his teammates. But I don\u2019t have the time to make such preparations, so I\u2019ll have to meet up with Galliard and get his help.\u2019It may have been a precious bond for his brother, but Yeon-woo didn\u2019t pay much attention to the fact.He was going to take whatever he could take from Gilliard.\u2018Even his skills, if possible.\u2019The white mask turned to northeast.\u2018If not, I\u2019ll have to force him.\u2019If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Akasha\u2019s Snake (2)Yeon-woo looked for Galliard as he killed the Orcs he encountered throughout his journey northeastward.The \u2018Baotri\u2019 that the Orc mentioned meant rugged rocky mountain. It was not easy to find a specific spot in the eastern desert area where everything around were rocky mountains.Moreover, Orcs were not fools either. After noticing that their scouts weren\u2019t coming back, they started sending groups consisting of more than a dozen Orcs and others even started to search for Yeon-woo on their own accord.Fortunately, he managed to find Galliard\u2019s cottage by then.\u201cIs this it?\u201dYeon-woo muttered in a low voice as he stood in front of one of the mountains. It was the highest and steepest rocky mountain in the vicinity. The height of it made the other mountains around look small in comparison.Yeon-woo narrowed his eyes and strengthened his eyesight.Then, as if he had zoomed in with a camera, he found something barely peeking out from the tip of the mountain. It was a small cottage roughly supported by a few thick wooden pillars on a sloping cliff. It looked like it could collapse in any moment, but Yeon-woo shouted with joy because it was the same cottage he had seen in the diary.Later I figured out, Galliard changes the location of his cottage with each round of the tutorial.It\u2019s so annoying to have to search every corner of eastern desert every time I visit.His brother also did not know why Galliard kept moving around. He could only guess that it had something to do with chasing Akasha\u2019s Snake.\u2018Let\u2019s get in there first.\u2019Yeon-woo started to climb up the rocky mountain, lightly hitting the ground.The slope was too steep and rugged to climb without a single piece of safety equipment, but thanks to his high stats and skills, it wasn\u2019t too difficult for Yeon-woo. All he had to do was to pinpoint the safe places to step on with his strengthened vision, and leap up with his strong leg muscles. Yeon-woo climbed so fast that before he knew it he had already landed on a small yard in front of the cottage.And he knocked on the door.\u201cExcuse me.\u201dBut no sound was heard from the inside.He expanded the scope of his senses and scanned inside the cottage, but he couldn\u2019t sense anything.\u201cIs anyone here?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t just open the door and enter without the owner\u2019s permission.In fact, Galliard was a character who seldom stayed at home and most of the time could be found outside walking around. So Yeon-woo sat on a bench in the yard, and began to wait for Galliard.*\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0 *\u201cWho are you?\u201dThe sunset was spreading across the sky when Gilliard returned home. When he arrived, Yeon-woo was in the middle of his meditation. He immediately opened his eyes and greeted Gilliard.\u201cI\u2019m Cain.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about your name. I\u2019m asking you what are you doing in front of my house?\u201dGalliard eyed at Yeon-woo up and down with a look full of suspicion.But to Yeon-woo, Galliard was a very intriguing existence.\u2018Demi-humans\u2026 They actually exist.\u2019A tall stature reaching about 190 centimeters, a sturdy but sleek body frame, brown skin tone, well-defined, handsome features\u2026 And then, the long, pointed ears. Galliard was not a human.An Elf, one of the most prominent members of the demi-humans. Among them, he was a Dark Elf that was classified as a natural born warrior.\u201cI\u2019ve been introduced by teammates. I\u2019d like to buy something. Are you the Galliard?\u201dWith a stiff expression, Galliard threw a freshly caught beast on the floor, and lowered his bow from his shoulder. He was getting ready for a fight.Dark Elves were often treated as freaks even among the Elves. While most of the Elves loved peace and cared for nature, the Dark Elves were more cruel and sometimes cold-blooded hunters. In some cases, they would abandon their teammates without any hesitation if it was for a greater good.Maybe that\u2019s the reason.When I first met Galliard, he was very doubtful and would always be on guard against others.\u201cI\u2019d like to get \u2018Undine\u2019s Goblet.\u201dGalliard slightly creased his brows.\u201cWho told you that?\u201d\u201cBraham.\u201d\u201cThat asshole. I told him not to go babbling about this anymore.\u201dBraham was the name of an old friend of Galliard. He was the person who had been originally trying to climb The Tower with him.\u2018And he was also one of the people that Jeong-woo called his masters.\u2019Yeon-woo was complete stranger to Braham, but he didn\u2019t care at all. He was going to leave Galliard as soon as he got the item he needed.\u2018There\u2019s no need to befriend him just because he was close to Jeong-woo.\u2019Galliard had nothing to do with the betrayal his brother had suffered. He had never entered The Tower, and had no will to intervene in any other business.But still, it wouldn\u2019t do him any good to reveal who he was. Even if he did, it would just make things awkward for both of them. For Yeon-woo, it was enough to know what kind of people his brother had connections with.\u201cOkay.\u201dGalliard let out a deep sigh. Then he slung his bow back on his shoulder and picked up the beast he had dropped before.\u201cCome in.\u201dYeon-woo followed Galliard into the cottage. The inside was not much different from where ordinary hunters lived. Along the wall were stuffed heads of all kinds of beasts and various hunting weapons were placed on the floor. Some scraps of leather were scattered on the table.\u201cYou can sit anywhere you want. Just give me some time to finish this.\u201dGalliard pointed to a chair with his chin as he pushed the pieces of leather to the side and placed the beast on the table.The beast he carried home had a slight resemblance to a deer, but it looked very different from what he had seen on Earth. The size was twice as big, and its legs were full of muscles. On its head, two sets of goat-like horns were tangled together.Galliard took apart the beast at a rapid pace. He drained the blood, removed the flesh, and took out the guts.Yeon-woo looked at his skills with admiration.\u201cYou into this kind of stuff?\u201dGalliard peeked at Yeon-woo.Yeon-woo nodded.\u201cSo we were in the same boat.\u201dGalliard smiled as he noticed the backpack Yeon-woo had brought. Some materials were poking out of the backpack.Looking at Galliard\u2019s smile, Yeon-woo noticed that he had lowered his guard considerably.Then after he was done, Galliard looked at Yeon-woo as he slammed the table with his blood-stained knife.\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s talk about business. You want Undine\u2019s Goblet?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dUndine\u2019s Goblet.It was a one time use artifact that could draw Akasha\u2019s Snake to the surface.\u2018To be exact, it\u2019s more like its favorite food.\u2019The reason why Akasha\u2019s Snake appeared on the surface was to fill its hungry stomach. In order to satiate its massive body, his food had to fulfill one of two conditions. Either it had to be present in large quantities, or\u2026\u2018It had to be nutritious.\u2019The \u2018Akasha\u2019 in the name of Akasha\u2019s Snake indicated the smallest unit of matter in the spiritual world. Others called it Ether, or Spirit Element(\uf9b3\u5b50).Akasha\u2019s Snake fed off of this spiritual energy. It wandered around the earth, absorbing energy from the ground, and often ambushed monster\u2019s settlements to rob them of their vitality. As a result, wherever Akasha\u2019s Snake passed by, it would turn into a wasteland where not a single blade of grass could grow. That\u2019s why the eastern part of Section E was filled with barren deserts and rocky mountains.And now, it was around the time when the last remaining bit of Akasha would disappear from the eastern region. This was the time when Akasha\u2019s Snake would suffer from hunger and thirst.So considering the situation, Undine\u2019s Goblet was a very useful bait to lure out Akasha\u2019s Snake.Undine\u2019s Goblet is an artifact that contains a great amount of Akasha. Of course, it is also the favorite food of Akasha\u2019s Snake. But the only problem was that,\u2018Galliard is the only one who knows how to make Undine\u2019s Goblet.\u2019Therefore, he was often visited by players who needed Undine\u2019s Goblet even for other reasons. But Galliard hid himself most of the time out of annoyance.\u201cYou know what the condition is, right?\u201dHe was talking about a condition, not a price.Yeon-woo nodded his head.\u201cI do, roughly.\u201d\u201cOkay. Then let\u2019s start right away.\u201dAt that moment.[The Dark Elf, Galliard, wants to test you. Your reward will be given only after passing this test.][Will you accept the test?]Galliard\u2019s sharp gaze seemed to pierce through Yeon-woo\u2019s mask.\u2018So this is it, Galliard\u2019s test.\u2019The condition for Galliard to give Undine\u2019s Goblet was very simple. It was to pass the test he gave.He never accepted anything else in exchange for the item. Only those who passed the test would receive Undine\u2019s Goblet as a reward.The reason was unclear. It seemed like he was expecting something from those who passed the test, but no one had ever fulfilled his expectations, and the same test has being repeated for decades.It was such a \u2018weird thing\u2019 for a player to do, but it was now considered as a matter of course, and that was why the system in The Tower accepted his test as a Hidden Quest.Yeon-woo then nodded.Then the message disappeared and a new window appeared.[Hidden Quest / Galliard\u2019s Test]Content: The Dark Elf, Galliard, has been testing many players for a long time in order to find someone \u2018qualified\u2019.Being blessed by the wind, his feet are known to be as quick as the wind itself. Your task is to catch Galliard on the run. To pass the test, you must tag him at least five out of ten times.Rewards: Rewards will be given according to the number of successes.\u2013 3 or more: Undine\u2019s Goblet\u2013 5 or more: Undine\u2019s Goblet + ??Yeon-woo\u2019s eyes glittered.\u2018More than half, is it?\u2019It was a game of tag. Galliard required players to catch him, and players could use any way possible. He allowed them to set up traps, use their artifacts, or collaborate with teammates.The players had to \u2018touch\u2019 Galliard within a set amount of time for it to be considered as a success.However, for decades, no more than five people had succeeded in tagging Galliard more than five times.\u2018But if I can make it, I can get a skill from him.\u2019Yeon-woo knew what was hidden behind the question marks in the quest window. It was a skill that Galliard had.\u2018Shunpo(\u77ac\u6b69)\u2019It was a special skill that had been passed down within the Dark Elves.\u2018Shunpo hastens ones movement and eliminates the sound produced by it. It\u2019ll be of great help in combat.\u2019Yeon-woo\u2019s primary weapon was his stealth and speed based on his strengthened senses. No other skill fit his combat style as good as Shunpo. That\u2019s why had Yeon-woo included acquiring it in his plans.But there was one more reason why Yeon-woo needed Shunpo the most.Missing a numbering on it, Shunpo might be seen as a mediocre skill.But I realized its true value only after seeing my teammate. The advantage of Shunpo lies not in its speed, but somewhere else.\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 It was a key element of another skill, \u2018Shukuchi(\u7e2e\u5730)\u2019Rank No. 1.The key to unlocking one of the best skills that symbolizes \u2018AllForOne\u2019.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Akasha\u2019s Snake (3)AllForOneHe was seriously the worst player I\u2019ve ever seen.* * *AllForOne was the the unchallenged first place in the rankings both as a player and as a clan, but little was known about his identity. For decades, hundreds or maybe even thousands of years, he no longer climbed up The Tower, only staying on the 77th floor.Since he was rarely seen outside, it was hard to even find a player who had met him in person. Only the nine top rankers, the \u2018Nine Kings\u2019 had ever seen him from afar. That\u2019s how much AllForOne disliked the company of others.He thought by himself, judged by himself, and he moved by himself. But every time he made a move\u2026 it always brought about tectonic changes within The Tower.In spite of being alone, the power he wielded was more than enough to overwhelm the other giant clans. So players started to call him with several titles.\u2018The Strongest\u2019, \u2018The Highest\u2019,Or \u2018The Ultimate\u2019.No matter who entered or left The Tower, he would still be the first ranker. Many players had challenged him for his position. But none of them was ever successful.However, the challengers\u2019 effort did not end in vain. They studied AllForOne and accumulated information about him. In the end, they were able to analyze some of his skills.And one of them was.\u2018Shukuchi.\u2019Yeon-woo\u2019s two eyes sank deeply.\u201cNo matter how far the distance, AllForOne could traverse it with one leap. He didn\u2019t even need tickets to move from floor to floor.\u2019At first, other players had speculated that AllForOne might have a magical skill like Teleport or Blink. However, those space transfer magics required a considerable amount mana and a long casting time.But AllForOne seemed to be free from those constraints neither requiring a casting time nor circulation of mana, by just taking one step he could go wherever he wanted to go.Therefore, many rankers and clans had exerted tremendous effort to block him from using this skill. But no matter how strong the barrier they used was, AllForOne could go in and out too easily.If he wanted to, he could easily assassinate someone without anyone noticing.Later on players figured out the skill he used was called Shukuchi. However, at that point, people met yet another obstacle. Even if they wanted to analyze the skill, they had no idea how to get it.Players ended up guessing that it was a Unique skill that only AllForOne had.However,The moment I saw AllForOne in the distance, my instincts told me something. What he had wasn\u2019t a Unique skill. Rather, it was something achieved by steadily honing his skills to the limit until he reached the peak.And I found out one more thing.I don\u2019t know how he did it but,The Shunpo that Galliard had showed during the tutorial, the same skill that Isaac had begged him to bestow, was actually the key to getting Shukuchi.But I bet Isaac won\u2019t know this until the end.When his brother found that out, he did not share this information with his teammates.At that time, the rift within Arthia had already deepened. He didn\u2019t know who he could trust.Instead, his brother concentrated on studying Galliard and his Shunpo, and he recorded the results in his diary.Yeon-woo, therefore, had to acquire Shunpo no matter the cost. Then, and only then, he could finish his brother\u2019s study. And also, he would be able to unlock Shukuchi.* * *\u201cThe rules are very simple. I\u2019ll be hiding around here and all you have to do is to tag me. I\u2019ll give you 15 minutes for each round.\u201dGalliard came out of the cottage and explained the rules of the test.\u201cI know that there\u2019s a big gap between you and me, so I\u2019ll place a handicap on myself. I won\u2019t use my hands, and I won\u2019t use skills other than movement related ones.\u201dGalliard raised his hands high and folded them behind his back.Yeon-woo nodded his head in silence. After all, Galliard\u2019s main skills were focused around his footwork and body techniques, not his fighting techniques.\u2018But he can\u2019t attack or defend, that\u2019ll be a great advantage.\u2019Instead of Carshina\u2019s Dagger, Yeon-woo drew out his old daggers and held them in reverse grip. Then he lowered his upper body slightly. He was ready to dash out at any time.Galliard accepted it as his consent and nodded his head.\u201cThen let\u2019s get started.\u201d*Pat*Galliard suddenly vanished into a thin air. His movements were indeed like the wind. He couldn\u2019t be caught with the naked eye.However,\u2018I should be able to find him.\u2019Yeon-woo activated both Sense Strengthening and Draconic Eyes at the same time.Clearly, Galliard had left almost no trace behind. But there was a strand of flaw flowing along the wind. Yeon-woo concentrated all his senses on that flaw and tried to chase after the source.There was one thing I realized while studying the skill Shunpo.Shunpo had a very critical weakness.\u2018Here!\u2019Yeon-woo turned his body to the right and quickly threw a dagger towards a gap between some rocks.At that moment, Galliard jumped out from that direction with a stiff look on his face.Shunpo is a skill specialized in stealth and speed. However, because it is too focused on its function, it does not erase the \u2018trace\u2019 left behind.Yeon-woo quickly dashed towards Galliard.\u2018The biggest characteristic of Shunpo is that it maximizes efficiency. It reduces useless movements and sticks to that purpose only.\u2019*Tak*Shortly before being caught by Yeon-woo, Galliard twisted his body in midair and managed to land on the ground.But Yeon-woo wasn\u2019t worried about finding him.\u2018And that means only one thing.\u2019This time it was to his west, on a dry tree.\u2018He is stepping on the flaws to move around.\u2019When Galliard was found for the second time, he had a surprised look on his face.Yeon-woo stretched out his hand but Galliard turned his body.\u2018I\u2019m not sure if the creator of Shunpo knew about the flaws. Maybe he did it instinctively. But one thing is for sure, as long as Shunpo uses the flaws\u2026\u2019Again, Galliard avoided Yeon-woo\u2019s hand by an inch. But by now, Yeon-woo was starting to read into Galliard\u2019s pattern.\u2018You will never escape my sight.\u2019Yeon-woo noticed the path of flaws Galliard was stepping on, so he threw his dagger to cut off the path.Galliard was so startled he had to deviate from the path. But when he jumped away, Yeon-woo was already in that place.*Tak*\u201cFirst try. Success.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dYeon-woo had already grabbed onto Galliard\u2019s sleeve.Galliard\u2019s face crumpled in disbelief. As long as he wasn\u2019t an idiot, he should have figured out that his weakness had been exposed.It was only after seeing Yeon-woo\u2019s eyes drawing a slight arc beneath his white mask that he realized Yeon-woo had gotten him. But it was Galliard himself who restricted him from using hands and other skills.*Chuckle*He couldn\u2019t help but laugh at himself.No matter how hard he tried to run away, with those restraints, there was nothing he could do when Yeon-woo blocked his path in advance.In the end, Yeon-woo succeeded in tagging Galliard several times.[You have managed to tag Galliard seven times. The maximum requirements for your quest have been fulfilled.][You have made an achievement that is not easily accomplished. Additional Karma will be provided.][You have acquired 2,000 Karma.][You have acquired 1,000 additional Karma.][You are now qualified to obtain Undine\u2019s Goblet as your reward. You can claim an additional reward. Find the Dark Elf, Galliard, for your reward.]\u201cMy goodness, I can\u2019t believe you got me so easily!\u201dGalliard laughed in dejection as he watched Yeon-woo put his hand on the right side of his chest.\u201dHe was confident that he wouldn\u2019t lose even to the rankers in The Tower. But he never expected his weakness to be discovered this fast.\u201cSo, how on earth did you figure it out? This isn\u2019t something that can be broken so easily.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my secret weapon.\u201dYeon-woo\u2019s response was simple.Galliard had his eyes fixed on Yeon-woo, but soon shook his head.A promise was a promise. Dark Elves must not make false promises.And on a second thought, maybe this mysterious young man could be the person he had been waiting for all this time.\u201cOkay then. Follow me.\u201dGalliard went back into his cottage and Yeon-woo followed right behind.* * *\u201cTake it. This is it.\u201dAs soon as Galliard entered his house, he brought out a bag from the corner of the room and held it out to Yeon-woo.Yeon-woo couldn\u2019t understand how could he store something so valuable without any locks or protection.\u2018What\u2019s he gonna do if someone comes to steal it?\u2019Yeon-woo was a bit appalled, but he opened the bag thinking all was good as long as he got it.*Click*Inside the bag, there was a round crystal orb shining like a sapphire. Blue water was swaying from side to side inside the orb.\u2018So this is the Undine\u2019s Goblet.\u2019[Undine\u2019s Goblet]Classification: JewelryRating: ADescription: Spiritual substance, a crystal orb filled with a dense concentration of Akasha. It is a priceless treasure for those who can handle Akasha, but a disaster for those who cannot.* Undine\u2019s BlessThe orb contains the source of Spirit of Water, Undine.\u201cYou\u2019ll have to be careful when handling it. If the liquid leaks out, it\u2019ll cause a disaster.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dYeon-woo nodded as he closed the bag.Akasha was a substance that could not be produced in the material world. The leak of such a material would result in a major explosion. It could easily blow up Yeon-woo to smithereens. But as long as he kept it in its bag, there shouldn\u2019t be any problem, because the bag itself was a specially designed artifact.\u201cAnd this too.\u201dGalliard offered an additional reward to Yeon-woo. A book covered in blue leather.The title was written in mysterious letters, but thanks to The Tower\u2019s system, he didn\u2019t have any difficulty in deciphering the letters.\u2018Shunpo.\u2019It was a skill book.[Shunpo]Rating: C-Proficiency: 0.0%A skill that used to be acquired only by select soldiers within the Dark Elves.

Attack speed is doubled for five seconds after killing an enemy, and the chance to inflict critical damage increases by 7%.Yeon-woo wanted to shout out with joy at the thought of having finally acquired what he wanted.Then he quickly put his hand on the surface of the book.It was very easy to learn a skill through skill books. Because of this fact, skill books were very expensive, and that made them hard for common players obtain.\u2018Learn.\u2019*Whoosh*With that command, the skill book scattered with a blue aura and was absorbed into his hand.[The skill \u2018Shunpo\u2019 has been created.][You will now be able to move swiftly. Your senses will also be improved, enhancing your physical abilities.]Yeon-woo felt that something was coming out of his body.\u2018It feels like my body is much lighter.\u2019So far, Yeon-woo had been working hard to perfect his body. He had made his senses keener, and his body stronger. But with the addition of Shunpo, he had now laid a foundation that could handle the agility of his enhanced body.His physical abilities must have grown considerably compared to before visiting Galliard.Of course, he had to train his usage of Shunpo to be fully proficient.\u2018I\u2019m almost done with the vessel, so it\u2019s time to fill in the content.\u2019The content of the vessel was simple. His most scarce stat, Magic Power.\u2018That can only be filled by killing Akasha\u2019s Snake.\u2019Its essence was beyond one\u2019s imagination.The energy that had been accumulated from the absorption of Akasha over a long period of time was immense enough to make it impossible to find similar items within The Tower. It was one of the greatest treasures one could find in the tutorial.That was the reason why Yeon-woo had come straight to kill Akasha\u2019s Snake.\u2018With Reinforced Physique, my body should be able to embrace the essence of Akasha\u2019s Snake. And then\u2026 that\u2019s when the succession process will be over.\u2019And now he could finally go and face Akasha\u2019s Snake.Yeon-woo licked his lips in anticipation. His heart had already started pounding.Meanwhile, Galliard was looking at Yeon-woo as he leaned himself against a chair. There was a hollow smile on his lips.\u201cBy the way, you got me thinking, the rookies in this round are quite amazing. I\u2019d never seen so many players in a single round who can read my movements, but including you\u2026. Ha! Or am I just too old now?\u201dAt the moment, Yeon-woo\u2019s eyes grew a little bigger.\u201cWere there people here ahead of me?\u201d\u201cThere were. Two players, they said they were siblings. And they both took Undine\u2019s Goblet and Shunpo, just like you did.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dYeon-woo could vaguely grasp who the two players were.The first and second places of the tutorial ranking.\u2018Was it Edora and Phante? Well, judging by the Karma they have, it\u2019s obvious they\u2019d been here.\u2019Galliard and Undine\u2019s Goblet wasn\u2019t necessarily a big secret. It wasn\u2019t particularly famous, but it had been around for a long time.Yeon-woo got up from his seat and picked up the bag containing Undine\u2019s Goblet.\u201cWell, I should get going now.\u201d\u201cOh, by the way, what are you planning to do with that? You don\u2019t seem like an alchemist or a spiritualist. I can\u2019t tell why you would need Undine\u2019s Goblet.\u201dYeon-woo wondered if he needed to tell his destination. However, considering his relationship with his brother, he decided to keep courtesy for their last meeting.\u2018It\u2019s not like he\u2019ll stop me.\u2019Galliard had only been chasing down Akasha\u2019s Snake, and never killed it himself. But of course, no one knew why.\u201cI\u2019m thinking of going after Akasha\u2019s Snake.\u201dSo he said blandly.But at that moment, Galliard\u2019s face stiffened.\u201cYou\u2019re going after Akasha\u2019s Snake?\u201dAll of a sudden, Yeon-woo got an ominous hunch.\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d\u201cUhm.\u201dGalliard uttered a short groan and said with a pitying look.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say this, but Akasha\u2019s Snake has already been killed. By the siblings I just told you about.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Akasha\u2019s Snake (4)After leaving Galliard\u2019s cottage, Yeon-woo hurried to the spot where Akasha\u2019s Snake was supposed to appear.According to the scenery he saw in the diary, the place should have been filled with several tall rocks standing like trees in a forest.\u201c\u2026.\u201dBut when Yeon-woo arrived, the whole place was in complete ruins.\u2018How the hell did they know about this place? Nobody should know about it except for Arthia.\u2019I could only explain our encounter with Akasha\u2019s Snake as a lucky encounter. We had just happened to be passing through that place during the time when it would show itself, and we were lucky Galliard was there to help us.However, I can say for certain that the experience from that time tied us together and helped us become who we are.As far as he knew, Akasha\u2019s Snake should only have appeared in the past three days. But the traces left here pointed to at least a week ago.Yeon-woo scanned through the nearby area just in case the snake that Phante and Edora had fought could have been a similar fake.However,\u2018Damn it. You\u2019ve shattered my expectations.\u2019Yeon-woo was able to find the body of the nearly torn apart Akasha\u2019s Snake beyond the collapsed rocks. A snake as big as a few rocky mountains combined was now lying dead in front of him. Each scale was as big as Yeon-woo himself. Its body was also so long that it seemed to be endless. Despite being death, its ferocity still lingered on its body. The mere sight of it overwhelmed him greatly.Yeon-woo meticulously examined Akasha\u2019s Snake\u2019s carcass with the last hope that Phante and Edora might have left something important behind.But even his effort was futile. They had already taken the most important parts of Akasha\u2019s Snake, such as the essence and the venom gland.It was the evidence pointing that Phante and Edora had hunted Akasha\u2019s Snake with a \u2018purpose\u2019 in mind, just like Yeon-woo.\u2018But how the hell did they kill it?\u2019Yeon-woo clicked his tongue as he stepped a few meters away from the carcass. Even then, he still couldn\u2019t capture its entire body within his field of view.And the more he looked, the more he wondered.Akasha\u2019s Snake wasn\u2019t a monster that could be so easily hunted. Its strength was as great as its size, so usually it was difficult to even approach it. In particular, the venom that oozed out from its fangs was strong enough to melt rocks. Not even ten or twenty players would be enough to kill this monster.But how did the two of them kill it?Did that mean that their power was unmeasurable? Or was there something else he didn\u2019t know?\u2018I don\u2019t understand how they managed to summon Akasha\u2019s Snake in the first place.\u2019Even if they used Undine\u2019s Goblet, how did they summon Akasha\u2019s Snake so soon? Could it be a magic? Or maybe another way he didn\u2019t know of?All sorts of thoughts were crossing through Yeon-woo\u2019s head. And after a period of pondering, only one thought was left in his mind.\u2018What do I do now?\u2019Yeon-woo took off his mask for a moment and swept up his bare face with his hand. It was almost the first time he had taken off the mask since entering the tutorial.That\u2019s how messy things were now in his head. He felt the need to feel the wind in order to get his thoughts organized.The hidden piece that he had been aiming for ever since the start of the tutorial had now vanished into thin air. The sole reason as to why he was so confident in catching up with the front runners was because of Akasha\u2019s Snake.But on a second thought, he felt he had been too complacent. Now he could understand how Phante and Edora were able to stack up such unbelievable amount of Karma points.But there was no use in crying over spilt milk. All his efforts had already been wasted,so he had to do something to make up for it.Yeon-woo quickly opened the tutorial ranking window.[Tutorial Ranking]1. Edora (64,571 Points)2. Phante (58,774 Points)3. Kahn (57,300 Points)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b740. Unknown (40,980 Points) (You)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201cThere\u2019s a 20,000-point gap between me and Edora. The gap is still steadily shrinking.\u2019Yeon-woo narrowed his eyes.\u2018What if I hoard as many Tokens as possible in Section E, clear all the hidden pieces left in Section F, and make a turnaround in section G?\u2019Yeon-woo racked his brain and tried to hypothesize various situations, but none of them seemed possible.\u2018Time\u2019s too tight. At best, I\u2019ll end up overtaking the 11th rank. Maybe 8th if I get lucky. There\u2019s no way I can reach first.\u2019Yeon-woo had to finish the tutorial in first place. Only in that way he would be one step closer towards the day of his revenge. It was all in vain if he couldn\u2019t be first.Besides, to complete the succession process he needed the essence of Akasha\u2019s Snake. So now that he couldn\u2019t get his hands on it, everything had been messed up.At this point, he had to revise his plan altogether. But for now, there was nothing he could do but to do his best to gather up Karma points until the last minute of the tutorial.In the end, Yeon-woo decided to leave the place thinking that he should be spending his time on getting more points.But then,\u2018Wait a second\u2026 What is that?\u2019Yeon-woo saw something just before walking away.It was on the other side that he hadn\u2019t searched properly. Several footprints were found along the head of the snake, and there were traces of strong impacts on its skull.At first, he thought it had been done by Phante and Edora during their fight with the snake.\u2018No. This wound was definitely made after its death. It\u2019s even recent.\u2019It was evidence that there were other people who had come here before Yeon-woo besides Phante and Edora.\u2018There must be something to it.\u2019Yeon-woo\u2019s instinct was telling him there was something. On the other hand, he thought he should be moving on in order to stack up more Karma points.However,\u2018Let\u2019s go check it out.\u2019Yeon-woo decided to trust his \u2018instincts\u2019 this time.On the battlefield, following this kind of animal instinct often brought unintended results.*Pat*Yeon-woo\u2019s body shot up into the air as his feet struck the ground. His movements were now much lighter thanks to the change followed by learning Shunpo. They were definitely more polished and quicker.[You have learned how to handle your body movements freely.][\u2018Shunpo\u2019 skill proficiency has increased. 1.2%]*Tak*Yeon-woo was able to reach the head of the snake after stepping on its body a couple of times. Near the top of its skull, there were several marks, as if it had been struck with a large axe over and over again.\u2018Whoever they were, they tried to get something out of the skull. What could it be? The brain?\u2019As far as he knew, the only useful parts of Akasha\u2019s Snake were its essence and venom gland.The rest were large pieces of body parts but of little use.And they had taken the brain. But why?By looking at the size of the footprints left behind, Yeon-woo could easily infer the identity of the group that took the brain.\u2018They are Orcs.\u2019Yeon-woo suddenly recalled what his brother had said in his diary.Various monsters in Section E had different customs according to their environment.Among them, the Orcs located in the eastern part of the section honored Akasha\u2019s Snake, which had long been the owner of the eastern desert area.Many different monsters lived in packs in Section E.Groups of Lizardmen were normally seen in the northern swamp, and the western jungle was inhabited by Goblins and Kobolds organized in villages. Orcs had settlements in the eastern desert area, and only the Trolls and Ogres lived independently in the southern region.But just because Orcs were present in large numbers in the eastern desert, it didn\u2019t make them the owners of the land.Deep underground, there lived Akasha\u2019s Snake.Sometimes, Akasha\u2019s Snake came out to the surface and attacked their settlements, for the Orcs, it was a symbol of dread and fear. Hence, they had the custom of worshiping Akasha\u2019s Snake as a god. And it seemed like the Orcs had noticed the death of Akasha\u2019s Snake and pulled out its brains with something in mind.\u2018What were they planning to do with it? If they were doing rituals, they could have either done it here or taken it to their settlements.\u2019But the traces were leading elsewhere. The opposite direction from where the Orc settlements were located.\u2018There must be something over there!\u2019Without further delay, Yeon-woo rushed out following the trail.*Swish*The trail was leading past Akasha\u2019s Snake\u2019s body and further into the ruins.As he traveled deeper along the trail, the wasteland started fading away with the appearance of bigger and steeper rocky mountains. It was a place where even his brother hadn\u2019t been.He traveled so far that he soon ended up reaching the end of Section E..Yeon-woo was stopped by a cliff that stood endlessly high.\u2018The Great Wall. This is the eastern end of Section E. Then\u2026\u2019Yeon-woo scanned the cliff with his Draconic Eyes. The Orcs\u2019 traces ended in front of a tunnel at the bottom of the cliff deftly hidden by rocks and trees.\u2018What are they doing in a place like this?\u2019Yeon-woo stepped into the tunnel immediately.At that moment.[You are the first player to enter \u2018Akasha\u2019s Snake Tunnel\u2019.][You have acquired 1,000 additional Karma.]\u2018What?\u2019Yeon-woo looked up at the unexpected message.A snake tunnel?Something that has to do with Akasha\u2019s Snake?*Thump**Thump*Yeon-woo felt his heart pounding loudly.Not to mention his brother, even Galliard did not know about this cave. That\u2019s why Galliard had to wait for a set time to face Akasha\u2019s Snake each time the tutorial reset. But if it had a cave, it would be a whole different story.\u2018There could be an egg, a snakeling, or its mate inside this cave.\u2019And the fact that the Orcs came here carrying its brain, must mean there was something hidden inside. At least something equal in value to Akasha\u2019s Snake.Yeon-woo tried to be as stealthy as possible and moved inwards into the tunnel. The deeper he went in, the louder the noises coming from the Orcs became.Then, as Yeon-woo entered a large cavity, he witnessed dozens of Orcs lined up along the vast open space.\u2018What is this?\u2019*Bum* *Bum*To the sound of the drums, the Orcs were offering a deep bow in a reverent manner. It was a scene reminiscent of a solemn religious ritual.At the end of the altar was a pile of dead Orcs and Lizardmen, and above it was a tray containing the brain of Akasha\u2019s Snake.\u2018These Orcs, they\u2019re insane.\u2019Yeon-woo frowned at the swirling madness of the Orcs and he lowered himself as much as he could.He felt like he could end up trapped in there forever if he cause any disturbance.Just then,*Kung*What looked like an Orc Shaman got up from his seat, stomping hard at the floor with his cane as he shouted a prayer in a voice filled with madness.\u201cChwiiik! Our God, murdered by the wicked humans! Arise from your death! Take our warrior\u2019s souls, bring yourself back to life and help us punish them!\u201dAs he chanted the prayer, the Orc Shaman took out a torch from a brazier next to the altar and set the sacrifices on fire.*Rush*As if they had been oiled beforehand, a fierce flame shot up from the bodies and devoured them completely.At that moment, something strange occurred in front of Yeon-woo\u2019s eyes.When a body is burned, it should turn into black ashes giving off a burnt smell. But in this case, the burnt offerings on the altar began to turn into a column of murky smoke the moment they burst into flames. Then the smoke gathered in the air, and soon, it was sucked into the brain of Akasha\u2019s Snake that was laid on the tray.Just like a sponge absorbing water, the smoke quickly disappeared into the brain. The offerings that had been piled up on the altar vanished, and the brain started to wriggle as if it was alive.By the time all the sacrifices were gone, something tore out from within the brain.Kaah!\u201c\u2026!\u201dWhen Yeon-woo saw what it was, he couldn\u2019t help but to strain his eyes wide.It was a snake.A snake of surprisingly small size compared to Akasha\u2019s Snake, but still it still seemed to be more than three meters long.A young Akasha\u2019s Snake.The snakeling screamed out of hunger.Kaaah!Then, a message appeared in front of Yeon-woo.[Hidden Quest / Resurrection Ceremony]Content: The body of Akasha\u2019s Snake is composed of half substance, half spirit. Given enough energy (Akasha), Akasha\u2019s Snake can be resurrected at any time.Orcs are trying to bring Akasha\u2019s Snake back to life with their ancient ritual. Stop the resurrection ceremony and kill the snake before it grows bigger.Reward: ????Yeon-woo opened his eyes wide in surprise.It was a quest telling him to stop the Orcs from resurrecting the snake.But to Yeon-woo, only one phrase entered his sight. The phrase that said Akasha\u2019s Snake could be revived.At that moment, a great idea crossed his mind.The tip of Yeon-woo\u2019s lips curled upward.\u201cIf I can grow Akasha\u2019s Snake bigger than before, and take its essence\u2026!\u2019If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Akasha\u2019s Snake (5)Yeon-woo knew that Akasha\u2019s Snake grows by feeding on Akasha. But he would have never thought that the concept of \u2018eating\u2019 would also help him revive.Yeon-woo felt like he could finally see a ray of hope. No, depending on how he handled the situation, the results could be even better than what he originally had in mind.The longer the time it spent on resurrecting itself, the larger it would become in size along with the amount of essence it possessed. If only he could absorb its full power.Yeon-woo\u2019s eye glistened with anticipation.\u2018Plus, this doesn\u2019t go against the quest\u2019s directive.\u2019The quest told him to stop the resurrection ceremony, but it didn\u2019t set a time limit for it. In other words, he would complete the quest as long as he killed it \u2018before\u2019 the ceremony ended.\u2018As long as the ceremony continues, I can keep making Akasha\u2019s Snake bigger and bigger. It won\u2019t be too late to kill it once it reaches its limit.\u2019Moreover, he was currently in the tunnel of Akasha\u2019s Snake. Who knows what other secrets were hidden inside, and what rewards would he receive after completing the quest?\u2018Considering the risk, it won\u2019t be small.\u2019This way, he might be able to acquire even more stats and Karma than he would have by following his original plan. The mere thought of it almost made him burst out laughing, but he held himself back.\u2018It\u2019s too early to celebrate.\u2019Strike while the iron is hot, as they said.Yeon-woo quickly began to work out the plan.\u2018The main variable in Akasha\u2019s Snake\u2019s resurrection is none other than Akasha, the spiritual energy. The more energy the snake absorbs, the bigger it will grow. It\u2019s just like Bathory\u2019s Vampiric Sword. If so, I will have to bring more food to fatten up the snake.\u2019Yeon-woo presumed Akasha\u2019s Snake must be hungry from its resurrection. He had to think of a way to get enough food to constantly feed Akasha\u2019s Snake.Undine\u2019s Goblet?\u2018No. Just one won\u2019t be enough. And Galliard probably doesn\u2019t have that many to spare.\u2019He immediately shook off the idea of asking Galliard for help. Yeon-woo didn\u2019t want to share the loot with anyone else.\u2018Then the only way left is\u2026\u2019Yeon-woo watched the last remaining corpse vaporizing into smoke.\u2018To bring more sacrifices here.\u2019Fortunately, there were many monsters wandering outside the tunnel. Monsters that would become a good meal for Akasha\u2019s Snake.\u201cIf I disturb the Orcs, the ceremony could be interrupted\u2026 I need to go farther away. Or maybe\u2026\u2019A sly grin crept over Yeon-woo\u2019s face.\u2018I could raise the stakes.\u2019If he could lure the monsters guarding each area\u2026 If only he could bring those monsters into this eastern desert area and cause mayhem\u2026 How much would Akasha\u2019s Snake grow with such quantity of food?Yeon-woo cast Shunpo and left the place after putting his thoughts in order.The ritual continued even after he left the tunnel.\u201cOh, our god, I beg of you!\u201dKaah!The cry of the snake shook up the whole tunnel.* * *[150:43:11_56]There was less than a week left until the tutorial\u2019s conclusion.The sixth ranked player in the tutorial, Bain, was now considering whether to stop collecting Tokens and moving on to Section F.\u2018I have to be in the top five. That\u2019s the only way I can be acknowledged by \u2018The Isle\u2019.\u2019The Isle.It was a word that the players of Arangdan used to address Cheonghwado.The Isle worked through meritocracy. He had to stand out and perform brilliantly in order to be reborn as a Ranker.Normally with Bain\u2019s level of skill, he would have easily achieved fifth rank, or even third rank if he was lucky. But there were too many abnormally strong players in this round. Phante, Edora, Kahn, and even the Marcusian swordsman. He was getting a little impatient thinking how he had to overtake those players to be able to reach the top five.Just then, Bain received an order.\u201cAn assassination mission? For me?\u201d\u201cYes. Bild has given the order for the members of the Team 1 to convene.\u201dBain\u2019s face crinkled up.His hands were already full with his own problems, but now he also had to participate in an assassination mission? Moreover, the target wasn\u2019t even in the top 10?That alone was enough to hurt his pride, but Bild even ordered them to operate as a team.Bain waved his hand in annoyance.\u201cSend the others. I have my hands full trying to keep my rank. Say that to Bild, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll understand.\u201dBut as he turned away, the messenger continued.\u201cThis is a special order. The ones who disobey will be cut off from the clan on the spot.\u201dBain gazed at the messenger with a now completely distorted face. At that moment, a cold aura spread through the air.Nevertheless, the messenger remained calm.\u201cSpecial?\u201d\u201cYes, so you have to move together as a team. He also offered all the Tokens in Arangdan\u2019s possession for the one who brings back his head.\u201dAt that moment, Bain\u2019s eyes shone with greed.Tokens collected by Arangdan as a clan. There must be at least a thousand, and he was willing to give them away for just one person.This was his opportunity to turn the tables.Not only that, but Bild would also be watching over his back.\u201cHowever, since the target is also the very player behind the annihilation of Team 2, Bild also advised to be as careful as possible..\u201dBain opened his eyes wide.Although Team 2 was inferior to Team 1, they were still a tough oponent because of their unruly temper. Even Bain\u2019s life would be at risk were he to fight them all at the same time.\u2018The reason why he told us to move together, it all makes sense now.\u2019Bild preferred to handle businesses in a more secure fashion.\u2018Wait a minute. If the target eliminated Team 2 completely, that means he has all their Tokens too, doesn\u2019t it?\u2019The Tokens from both Arangdan and Team 2.\u2018Without a doubt, that would boost me up to the top five.\u2019Bain\u2019s eyes had a cold glimer. The corners of his mouth rolled up.\u201cAll right. Tell him I\u2019ll be moving on to the gathering spot immediately.\u201dThe messenger disappeared with a farewell.Without further delay, Bain moved straight towards the designated location. He was anxious that others might take away the Tokens if he was late.And in Section E, fifteen other players with similar thoughts were heading towards the same location at the same time.But little did they know, they were heading straight into an impending disaster.* * *Yeon-woo\u2019s first destination was not far from the eastern desert area. He was currently nearing the border of the northern swamp.Yeon-woo secretly followed a Lizardman Scout and found its village.[\u2018Shunpo\u2019 skill proficiency has increased. 7.1%]Shunpo was a skill that very much suited Yeon-woo. He tried out various complex moves he had envisioned in his head, as such, his skill proficiency had been increasing at a quick pace.Thanks to the skill, Yeon-woo was able to slip into the central part of the village\u2019s main barracks. Inside, a slightly bigger Lizardman, seemingly the chief, was giving orders to his army.\u201cOur king is dead, and it must not be known. Especially to the Orcs. if they find out, they will rush out to fight us. We have to be careful.\u201d\u201cRoger!\u201d\u201cRoger!\u201dThe Lizardman Warriors nodded their heads and exited the room in an orderly way.\u201cThis is tiresome.\u201dThe big Lizardman sat down on his chair and muttered in a cold tone.\u2018They must be having a lot of troubles after Hargan\u2019s death.\u2019Yeon-woo quickly checked the title of the currently agonizing Lizardman.[Kurarak, chief of the 21st tribe]It seemed he had come at just the right time. At present, the Lizardmen lost both Hargan, the Lizardman King, and Taragan, the strongest warrior of their species. They now had no pivotal force to bind them together. The whole species was suffering from all sorts of problems. If a war broke out in a time like this, they would be pushed out of their territory. They had to raise their guard and keep their mouths shut.\u2018It\u2019s better this way.\u2019On the other hand, Yeon-woo thought of this as a great opportunity. What he wanted was to create chaos between monsters. If he could take advantage of this, it would be easier to drive a wedge between monsters.*Pat*Yeon-woo then jumped at Kurarak.\u201cWhat! An assassin\u2026 Kuk!\u201dKurarak sensed Yeon-woo\u2019s presence and reached out for his scimitar but,*Puck*Carshina\u2019s dagger was already stuck in his forehead.Kurarak fell to his back from the impact.It was a pitiful end for one of the 25 tribal chiefs representing the Lizardmen.Yeon-woo threw the corpse of an Orc he had killed on his way here next to Kurarak\u2019s body. Then he smashed a couple pieces of furniture.\u2018When the Lizardmen find this, they will think that Kurarak died fighting against an Orc assassin. And the bigger the damage, the better the effect will be.\u2019Yeon-woo spread out his hand and cast Flame Infusion.*Rush*A flame shot up over his palm. It was small due to his lack of proficiency, but it was still enough to set something on fire.Yeon-woo threw the flame a small distance away from the corpses.Being a flame created by a skill, it quickly spread and engulfed the barracks in seconds.\u201cFire! Fire!\u201d\u201cChief! Something\u2019s wrong with our chief!\u201dSoon, the whole tribe fell into great turmoil.Watching the chaos unfold, Yeon-woo leisurely walked away and moved on to the next place.He had several places to visit this evening.* * *Over night, the whole swamp was plunged into utter confusion.Lizardmen were already on high alert over the death of their king and queen. The tension reached its peak as the chiefs and some other warriors were found murdered. And when they found out that Orcs were related to those cases, they all went into rage.\u201cThe Orcs have killed our king and queen! Orcs are about to invade our territory! Orcs will be coming here soon!\u201dA shout was heard among the crowd, and it was enough to stir up the whole tribe.\u201cWe shall strike before they can! This is a war! And we will have our revenge!\u201dAnd the next morning, the northern swamp quaked. Armies of thousands of Lizardmen began their move towards the eastern desert area.In the meantime, Yeon-woo was moving towards the jungle in the west.I\u2019ve been using \u2018carcass\u2019 for everything that\u2019s non-human, but I think \u2018corpse\u2019 should be better for humanoid monsters.
