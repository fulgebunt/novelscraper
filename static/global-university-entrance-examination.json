    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: Death QuestionNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe snow fell for four hours. It didn\u2019t show any signs of stopping.This place is a barren mountain cabin. Various hunting tools hung from the walls and a long wooden table gnawed away by termites sat in the centre. Around the table sat a group of people. Male, female, young and old, they were all present. There was even a foreigner amongst them.The room was very cold. Everyone present shivered with a solemn expression on their faces but no one moved to start a fire. The old radio sitting on the table was speaking.\u3010It is currently 17:30 Beijing time.\u3011\u3010There are still 30 minutes until the exam starts. Examinees, please quickly head to the examination centre.\u3011The radio sounds were scratchy and there were also static noises one would typically hear in the background of radio broadcasts from the 1950s. It tirelessly buzzed.This was already the second broadcast. The first broadcast was three hours ago. It said \u3010Welcome to examination centre 003712.\u3011 which immediately caused an old lady to faint and even now she had not yet recovered.Another person didn\u2019t listen to its instructions and attempted to destroy the radio\u2026\u2026. After removing the batteries, he ran out of the room like he was possessed. Five minutes later his body fell from the roof together with a pile of snow.Since then, no one dared to touch it.\u3010Please enter the centre as soon as possible and avoid loitering outside.\u3011This sentence was repeated three times. The room was deathly silent.After a long time, someone sitting at the head of the table muttered irritably: \u201cSo who hasn\u2019t entered yet?\u201dThis person had a yellow head of slightly permed hair. His figure was lean, and he was average in height. Both his arms were tattooed with a sleeve of animals. Despite being unable to tell whether it was a dog or camel, it looked quite intimidating.The person sitting next to him shrank back a little and answered: \u201cOld Yu.\u201d\u201cWho is Old Yu?\u201d\u201cThe drunkard who vomited the moment he entered through the door. The one who brought along his son and nephew.\u201dThe person who answered pointed towards the wall using his lips and then carefully made a \u201cquiet\u201d gesture.Lying on the beaten sofa by the wall was the nephew.It was a 27 or 28-year-old young man. He had a tall figure and his appearance was very extraordinary. When he held the doorframe and lowered his head to enter the cabin, the picturesque mountain pines covered in snow behind him paled in comparison. However, ever since he entered, he constantly maintained a dull expression. He seemed to be a little aloof.According to Old Yu who rambled incessantly, his nephews name is You Huo.\u201cHe had only returned for two months and came to Harbin to find me during the National Day holidays. I was originally supposed to take him to the airport tomorrow morning. Sigh\u2026\u2026.It\u2019s all my fault! Useless!\u201dOld Yu had drunk until he was completely intoxicated. During the night where there were few people around, he stumbled around.On the sidewalk in front of the children\u2019s hospital, someone had left a bunch of joss paper1. Old Yu stumbled around and wasn\u2019t able to regain his balance. With one foot stepping onto the joss paper, everything spun and himself, his son and his nephew were all sent here.When they entered the cabin, he had not yet recovered from the dizziness. No longer able to hold himself back, he vomited all over You Huo. Old Yu sobered up from his drunken state after vomiting but he was too scared to say anything to You Huo.The people who came here were all caught unexpectedly and were completely unprepared. Only the foreigner called Mike had a set of clean clothes in his bag.After You Huo changed, he remained distant from the others and laid on the sofa without a word. He appeared to have fallen asleep.Through the arm that covered his face, you could see a stud earring on his right ear. It reflected the light coming from the oil lamp and appeared very dazzling.\u00b7The sky should have darkened but every part of the mountain was covered in snow and it was still bright outside.A pregnant woman looked towards the cabinet in panic. The time on their phones had become erratic and they could only rely on the clock sitting above the cabinet to tell the time: \u201cIt\u2019s almost six. Could Old Yu have\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dBang, bang, bang!Before she could finish her sentence, the sound of something smacking against the door was heard.Everyone was shocked. They looked over with fearful eyes. The snow piled up on the window was pushed aside and Old Yu\u2019s face appeared through the glass. With exaggerated mouthing, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s me. Open the door.\u201dEveryone was relieved.Fortunately, he had returned before 6 o\u2019clock and didn\u2019t die.The two snow covered men entering the house was Old Yu and his son Yu Wen.\u201cHow is it outside?\u201d Everyone hurriedly asked.Old Yu shivered in place for a moment before slapping his face forcefully. He then slapped his son. When they finally warmed up a little, he said: \u201cI went around everywhere but it was useless! No matter where I went, in no more than ten minutes I would see the cabin again. We can\u2019t get out!\u201d\u201cWere there other people? Or houses even?\u201dOld Yu spoke frustratedly: \u201cNo, don\u2019t count on it.\u201dEveryone\u2019s expression fell into despair.There was no signal on the phone and the time on it had become erratic. The trees all looked the same so it was hard to tell which direction was north, south, east or west. There was absolutely nothing.This was their current predicament.Oh, there was also an old radio that noisily reminded them about the exam.Exam your mum.The moment Old Yu stepped in, the radio started to make static sounds.Just being around it for the entire afternoon was enough for the people present to develop a conditioned reflex. They immediately quietened down and looked at the radio.\u3010All examinees have been admitted. The exam rules are as follows.\u3011Old Yu and Yu Wen who had just entered the examination centre gulped.\u3010The exam is conducted within a set period of time.\u3011\u3010After the exam officially starts, examinees cannot enter the examination centre. You may not leave the centre during the exam without permission. If there is an emergency, you must follow the instructions and leave with the invigilator.\u3011\u3010Apart from open book exams, you cannot use mobile devices or other communication tools. Please be considerate and turn them off.\u3011\u3010The exam is point-based. Examinees must write their answer on the designated answer sheet (except in special circumstances) or the answer is invalid.\u3011When the radio finished speaking, everything once again turned silent.After a while, the room suddenly started to fall into discussion.\u201cWho is the invigilator?\u201d\u201cThere are open-book exams?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s an answer sheet?\u201d\u201cTo think that you\u2019re discussing it. You all must be crazy.\u201d The tattooed man played with his swiss army knife. You couldn\u2019t tell what he was thinking.\u201cThen what should we do?\u201d The eyes of the pregnant woman were still swollen from crying. She said quietly: \u201cDon\u2019t forget about that\u2026..\u201dShe pointed to the roof.The tattooed man thought of the body and his face also paled. He stiffened for a moment before finally accepting the situation. Holding the swiss army knife, he waved it in a particular direction: \u201cLittle brat.\u201dYu Wen looked left and right and then pointed at himself: \u201cYou\u2026\u2026mean me?\u201d\u201cYes, you. Come, sit here.\u201d The tattooed man patted the seat closest to him.\u201d\u201cI, uh\u2026\u2026..\u201d Yu Wen turned around to look at his brother only to see his brother still lying on the sofa like he was dead. He suppressed the curses inside him and said: \u201cI\u2019m 18.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, the tattooed man is at most 25 or 26-years-old. How dare he call him little brat.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how I call you!\u201d The tattooed man was impatient, \u201cCome here. Let me ask you. Are you a student?\u201dYu Wen: \u201cI guess so.\u201dThe tattooed man frowned: \u201cCan you do exams?\u201dOld Yu reflexively said: \u201cHe can! He grew up doing exams!\u201d\u201cYou can shut up.\u201d Yu Wen said rudely to his drunkard old man.But after he scolded his father and turned around, he saw that everyone in the room was staring at him.Yu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe thought about his words and said: \u201cI just finished the University Entrance Examination in June and I have been playing like crazy for the past three months. I\u2019ve already\u2026\u2026\u2026Yeah, I can\u2019t do them very well anymore.\u201dThe pregnant woman had panicked for the entire afternoon. She smiled with great effort: \u201cThat is still better than us. It was only three months for you. We have long forgotten now.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Yu Wen found the situation a little absurd and even forgot about his fear, \u201cDon\u2019t you guys read novels or watch movies? Would it truly be an exam in this horror kind of setting? It\u2019s probably just a cover!\u201d\u201cCover for what?\u201dYu Wen rolled his eyes: \u201cHow would I know? Anyway, people just die everywhere in horror movies. Who the hell would suddenly come and test you on maths and physics? Is this cabin built by the Ministry of Education?\u201dHe still didn\u2019t feel like he had said enough. He added at the end: \u201cHah.\u201dHis cousin who was lying on the sofa like a dead pig was finally awakened by his \u201chah\u201d.Yu Wen turned around to look at him.He saw You Huo sit up and look at the group of people through half-open eyes. You Huo then kneaded the back of his neck. The legs resting on the old wooden floor were long, making the sofa appear even smaller.The timing seemed to have been calculated and the moment he lowered his hand, the clock above the cabinet started to ring to signal that it was 6 o\u2019clock.Static sounds were emitted through the radio again.\u3010It is currently 18:00 Beijing time. The exam has officially begun.\u3011\u3010As another reminder, examinees are not allowed to enter the centre after the exam has started and you cannot leave without authorisation during the duration of the exam or you will be punished.\u3011\u3010The other examination rules are as per the standard.\u3011After it threw out a threat in passing, it paused for two seconds and said:\u3010Exam duration: 48 hours.\u3011\u3010Subject: Physics.\u3011Yu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u3010We will now be distributing the exam papers and the answer sheets. I wish you all the best.\u3011After the radio was done, it once again died off.Yu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dGoddammit, shouldn\u2019t the exam paper and answer sheet be distributed first???The pregnant women cried out in panic: \u201cThat wall!\u201dShe was referring to the wall above the fire stove. The empty wall that was covered in several knife marks now had a few more words \u2014\u2014\u2013Topic: A group of travellers came to a snow mountain\u2026\u2026.Exam details: The response will be collected every 6 hours. If no points are earned within 6 hours, you lose qualification to participate and will be evicted.Below that was a large blank area. It was like the response area in a test paper for answers to be written in.What question is this? What is it asking? What do we answer?Everyone was confused.Not to mention 6 hours, even if you gave them 600 hours they didn\u2019t know how to earn the points.At this moment, a gust of cold wind that carried small beads of snow rushed into the room causing everyone to shiver.They looked over at the source of the wind and saw that You Huo had walked over to the window and had opened half of it.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d The tattooed man was furious.You Huo had one hand in his trouser pocket and his other hand was about to reach out. Hearing the yell, he glanced back. However, perhaps it was because the look was so fleeting, it looked cold and arrogant.The tattooed man was even more enraged: \u201cDon\u2019t you know to say something before opening the window? What are you going to do if something goes wrong?\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201dYou Huo threw out those three words and no longer paid him any attention. He again stretched out his left hand.Old Yu could no longer hold back. He urged his son and whispered: \u201cYou ask.\u201dFor some reason, Old Yu had always seemed to be afraid of this nephew of his.Yu Wen shouted: \u201cBrother, what are you doing?\u201dYou Huo retracted his left hand and waved at him. Finally, he gave them his answer: \u201cTesting out the consequence of leaving the examination centre.\u201dEveryone present gasped. Crimson red blood flowed down his fingers onto his palm. With his pale skin, it looked even more shocking.He casually rubbed it off and once again fiddled around with the windowsill. He picked up a rusty tin can and threw it out the window.Under everyone\u2019s gaze, the tin can was smashed into smithereens and it scattered across the snow.When they once again looked at the \u201cExam Details\u201d, everyone\u2019s eyes were filled with panic.By the wall, You Huo once again closed the window. His eyes swept past each and every one of their backs.As for Yu Wen who had some experience with exams\u2026\u2026.You Huo understood him well.During the three years of high school, this high school student messed around with love and the wrong group of friends. He would often skip class to play games at internet cafes and he suffered from a strong case of eighth-grade syndrome2. Even now, he had not yet escaped that dangerous period.It would be better to rely on a dog than him.As for the others\u2026.Old, frail, sick, pregnant, and even a thug.All five deadly poisons are present.The opening question is a death question3.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: InvigilatorPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYou Huo kicked the metal can of charcoal over and Old Yu carefully used it to start a fire. The fire in the fire stove emanated an orange-red glow.Yu Wen squatted next the fire and dejectedly threw wood in.The flames flickered as he watched it for a while. He decided that he should go find someone to talk to about his feelings before he died but, when he looked up, he saw his brother standing on the side warming his hands with a cold and disinterested expression.Yu Wen considered it for a few seconds and decided to die quietly instead.\u00b7\u201cUmm that\u2026\u201d Old Yu suddenly spoke.You Huo glanced over.\u201cI don\u2019t know how I should refer to you.\u201d Old Yu patted the pregnant woman\u2019s shoulder: \u201cWith a stomach like that, how can you freeze here? This isn\u2019t right, go over there to warm up. Don\u2019t catch a cold. It\u2019s not good for both you and your child.\u201dThe pregnant woman who heard these words was stunned for a moment. Tears flowed steadily down her face.Old Yu was surprised: \u201cWhat\u2019s this? What\u2019s wrong?\u201dThe woman silently cried: \u201cI don\u2019t even know if it has life\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHaving said that, she still moved her chair closer to the fire.The woman cried for a while before finally stopping. With strong nasal tone, she said to Old Yu: \u201cOh right, please call me Yu Yao.\u201dOld Yu forced out a laugh and said: \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to also be from the same family line. You look about the same age as my neph\u2026\u2026..\u201dOld Yu glanced at You Huo through the corner of his eyes. His words then quickly changed: \u201c\u2026\u2026..son. When we get out of this damned place, I\u2019ll give you a big fat red envelope to wish both mother and child a safe birth.\u201dThe tattooed man grumbled in a sullen face: \u201cThe situation is already fucking like this and you have the time to chat\u2026\u2026Fuck!\u201dThe others who heard his words stiffened. They scattered and started to search around the cabin.However, while the others were looking for clues to solve the problem, the tattooed man concentrated on finding all kinds of self-defence hunting tools.You Huo didn\u2019t move away. He continued to warm up his hands by the stove. He gently touched the question on the wall and then looked down at the miscellaneous items sitting on top of the stove.There were a few bottles and jars, a pile of darkening coins, several strangely shaped pebbles, scattered chicken feathers and even a mouldy pacifier from who knows what century.Yun Wen saw that You Huo wasn\u2019t moving so he also didn\u2019t dare move.He recalled what his teacher had said before he did the university entrance examination. When you have no clue, read the question a few times. Thinking this, he stood before the wall and read it through repeatedly.\u201cA group of travellers came to a snow mountain\u2026\u2026.\u201cTravellers\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSnow mountain\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhen he returned to his senses after reading it through, he realised that the room was very quiet. Everyone was looking at him.Yu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026I was just reading.\u201dOld Yu had the same issue most parents have. When there are many people around, they wanted to show off their child: \u201cDid you think of something?\u201dYu Wen rolled his eyes: \u201cNo.\u201dEveryone had a look of disappointment. They continued to rummage around.Only the tattooed man didn\u2019t relent. He assessed Yu Wen suspiciously: \u201cReally? You\u2019re not trying to hide something are you?\u201dYu Wen: \u201cWhy would I hide it?\u201dThe tattooed man stared at him for a while. That look made those on the receiving end feel irked.\u201cFine then. You\u2019d better not be.\u201dThe thug appeared to be used to threatening others and every word that came out of his mouth was harsh. After he said that, he returned to rummaging through the hunting tools.Yu Wen silently stuck up his middle finger and said inside: Stupid.This classmate had just entered adulthood and was still in a state of peak narcissism. He felt that everyone in the world was stupid and even his own father couldn\u2019t be spared. The only exception was You Huo.In fact, he had only become familiar with You Huo over the past two years. Old Yu had said that You Huo was staying overseas to receive treatment for his illness and would come back to China from time to time. Every time he returned, he would stay a few days at his place.With the days all added up, it actually wasn\u2019t very long.But, using the spirit of learning that Yu Wen had never applied to his own studies, he came to understand some things.For example, there was something wrong with You Huo\u2019s memory. He would have no impression of people he had encountered a few years ago and this was also the reason why he went overseas for treatment.Also, for example, the elders in the family appeared to be a little afraid of him.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogThis point really puzzled Yu Wen. He had asked Old Yu about this a few times, but Old Yu would always tell him to stop thinking useless things.Time passed and he soon felt that it was normal.After all, even the thug who had only just met You Huo was a little afraid.With his brother next to him, Yu Wen originally intended to call the thug a few names and anger him a little but when he turned back he saw that You Huo was gone.Yu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Where did he go?\u201dThe pregnant woman asked Yu Wen: \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t convenient for her to move around so she couldn\u2019t search the cabin with the others.Yu Wen: \u201cMy brother.\u201dYu Yao: \u201cHe went that way.\u201dShe indicated the direction with her chin.\u00b7This cabin wasn\u2019t small. On the first floor was the living room and three other rooms and in the corner was an old wooden ladder that led to a small attic above.It was really because there were too many things here and the fact that there were many people inside as well that the cabin felt small and cramped.The bedrooms on the first floor were locked. The strangely designed lock hanging from it was rusty.What was even more strange was that a rooster was hung from one door and a hen on the other.The two chickens had their blood drained, but their feathers were neatly combed. With their heads bent in the same direction, those looking at it felt a strange sense of horror.When Yu Wen came over, You Huo was standing in the shadows by the door.It was scarier than the chickens.\u201cBrother, what do you have in your hands?\u201d Yu Wen rubbed the goosebumps on his arms.\u201cHaven\u2019t you seen an axe?\u201d You Huo lazily raised his eyes.\u201cI\u2019ve seen it\u2026.\u201dYu Wen internally wanted to say that it was because he had seen it that he asked. Why are you holding an axe out of nowhere?Holding it was fine but You Huo was also carelessly feeling out the blade with the thumb of his other hand.\u201cAfter looking around, have you thought of anything?\u201d He asked without looking up.\u201cAh?\u201d Yu Wen was a little confused, \u201cWhat should I have thought of?\u201dYou Huo looked at him.With his tall height, he would lower his eyes when looking at others. His eyes were also of a clear light brown colour and his eyelids are thin. Although he is very good looking, with his expressionless face there was a sense of dissociation and distance.It was hard to describe. In any case, you just couldn\u2019t feel any sense of familiarity.Yu Wen couldn\u2019t handle the look: \u201cGive me an example.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cWhat questions are related to the snow mountains?\u201dYu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Not sure.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cYou didn\u2019t go to school?\u201dYu Wen: \u201cI went\u2026\u2026.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cDid a dog go in your place?\u201dYu Wen: \u201cI learnt a few skills\u2026\u2026\u2026Selecting the shortest option if three are long and one is short, selecting the longest one if three are short and one is long, choosing B if there are two long and two short options and choosing C if they are all different. I\u2019ve basically relied on this for physics.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dYu Wen: \u201cThere\u2019s also another point.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dYu Wen: \u201cI learnt to give up.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cScram.\u201dYu Wen guessed that if he continued, the axe would probably be lodged into his head so he quickly shut his mouth.His beloved cousin finally looked away and no longer paid him any attention.After a while, Yu Wen couldn\u2019t hold back and asked another question: \u201cBrother, why are you holding onto that?\u201d\u201cFinding a pen.\u201d You Huo said that and even snorted at him with slight disappointment. He then threw the small axe into a waste bucket.Yu Wen stared at the axe: \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cPen.\u201dYu Wen felt that either himself or You Huo must be crazy.You Huo over no longer paid him any attention. After saying that, he climbed up the wooden ladder.\u00b7As they searched around, time went by very fast.The red number on the wall had been changing from 6 to 5 and then to 4.The time for their responses to be collected was getting closer and closer, and everyone became more and more tense. They had no clue and didn\u2019t know where to start. There was even a countdown resembling those in a university entrance examination before them.Under the strong pressure, there would always be people who would panic and start guessing haphazardly.When You Huo came back down, the pregnant woman was holding onto a small black bottle and was about to write something on the blank wall.Rich acidic odour emanated out from the bottle. It was like ink that had been left out for too long, but its colour was a little different from ink. Perhaps it was because of the dim lighting, it appeared a little rusty brown in colour.\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u2026.Is it really okay writing like this\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026?\u201d Yu Yao\u2019s face was pale, and her voice revealed her inner panic. She seemed to be asking for reassurance from the others, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have much to do with physics\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWe have no information about the question so who knows what can give us points!\u201d A bald and short middle-aged man yelled out with a sullen face: \u201cI even suspect that there\u2019s probably no such thing as a correct answer! It\u2019s blank now and 6 hours later it will continue to be blank. We can\u2019t escape from death.\u201dHe then glared at Yu Yao: \u201cDon\u2019t have the courage to write? If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll do it!\u201dPlease support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogYu Yao shrank back a little. Her wet finger still landed on the wall.She drew two strokes but saw that the water on her fingertip didn\u2019t leave any traces on the wall. The strokes that she made had already disappeared.It was even accompanied by faint water sounds.Like the answer wall had\u2026\u2026..swallowed it up.\u201cI, I can\u2019t do it\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Yu Yao panicked.\u201cHow is that possible?! Not enough ink?\u201d The bald man rushed over, stuck his finger in the ink bottle and forcefully pressed it onto the wall.The result was the same as before.Before he was able to finish drawing one stroke, the beginning of it had already disappeared.The faint water sound was heard again.The bald man was stunned for a while. His emotions suddenly went out of control: \u201cNo\u2026\u2026\u2026Why can\u2019t we write? It must be because there\u2019s not enough ink\u2026\u2026\u2026not enough ink\u2026\u2026\u2026yes\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe reached out to grab the ink bottle.Just as the whole bottle of ink was about to be poured onto the wall, the bald man\u2019s hand was suddenly held down.He turned out to look and saw You Huo looking down at him from above. With a cold face, he said impatiently: \u201cDon\u2019t be crazy. The wall isn\u2019t right.\u201dThe bald man subconsciously struggled for a bit. His face was completely red but he couldn\u2019t pull back his hand.\u201cYu Wen.\u201d You Huo turned his head, \u201cGive me the rope by the wall.\u201dThe bald man struggled while his face was red and the veins on his neck bulged: \u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201dYou Huo used one hand to flexibly tie a knot. He wrapped the rope around him\u2026\u2026\u2026.and even tied his arms together.Classmate Yu Wen was shocked: \u201cBrother\u2026\u2026\u2026.What did you do before? How can you do this so skilfully?\u201dYou Huo\u2019s light coloured eyes swept over him.Yu Wen only now remembered\u2026\u2026\u2026His brother probably didn\u2019t know himself.The bald man was thrown onto the beaten sofa. You Huo screw shut the bottle of so-called \u201cink\u201d.The moment the bottle cap was tightened, everyone in the room heard a soft sigh.\u201cWho?!\u201dEveryone\u2019s hair stood up.As the final stain on the answer wall faded, a line suddenly appeared in the originally blank space:Violation warning: Did not use the correct exam stationery. The invigilator has been notified.Invigilator: 001, 154, 922The rooster in the cabin suddenly called out.Yu Wen was so scared he almost cried out together with it. He grabbed onto his brother\u2019s sleeve and fearfully looked at the door with wide eyes.You Huo wanted to walk over to the door but he had Yu Wen hanging from him like a dead fish trying to hold him back. In the end, Yu Wen was dragged together as he moved over to the door.Outside the window, through the billowing snowstorm, three figures appeared in the distance.The one at the front was tall, had short black hair and was wearing a slim-fitting coat. Even just by looking at the outline, you could see that his figure was straight and proper. When he walked over to the door, a gust of wind blew past and the snow within it obscured his vision.He lowered his head and blinked a little, and snow particles fell from his face. When he looked up again, his dark eyes that reflected some of the snow just happened to land on You Huo.You Huo subconsciously touched his earring.Yu Wen whispered next to him in a small mosquito-like voice: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you know him?\u201dYou Huo furrowed his brows and quietly answered: \u201cI forgot. \u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: Solitary ConfinemenPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaytJudging from their positions, the man at the front was probably invigilator 001.He acted like someone who came to find shelter from the snow. While he assessed the cabin, he took off his leather gloves and said with a smile: \u201cNot bad, there\u2019s even a fire. The snow outside is quite heavy so it was very cold coming here.\u201dNo one smiled back.Most of the people in the room had shrunken back.He acted like he didn\u2019t notice this reaction and leisurely walked over to the fire stove to warm up his hands. The smile from earlier still lingered at his lips and it brought along with it a sense of lazy teasing.The snow on his shoulders and collar slowly disappeared, leaving behind a slightly damp stain. It then slowly dried up.Everyone stared at him, but no one dared to speak.The tin can that was thrown out was smashed into smithereens, but they went through the snow without a single scratch on their skins.Yu Wen hid behind You Huo while trembling. It even caused You Huo to shake along with him.He pathetically asked: \u201cAre they still human?\u201dThe 001 man appeared to have heard this and he turned to look at You Huo.His eyes were an extremely dark black. With him standing against the light, the light from the fire would occasionally flicker in his eyes. The teasing in his eyes still had not yet scattered.You Huo expressionlessly looked back at him. He grabbed onto the trembling boy behind him and asked calmly: \u201cCan you shut up?\u201dYu Wen didn\u2019t dare to move.\u00b7It was only until Mr. 001 finished warming up his hands and wore his gloves again that the invigilator standing at the door spoke in an official tone: \u201cWe are the invigilators for this round. I am No. 154. We have just received news that two of you didn\u2019t follow the examination rules.\u201dThe pregnant lady Yu Yao turned pale. She was originally unable to stand up straight and this time she was about to faint.She was like a water faucet. Tears gushed out from her eyes.As for the bald man tied up on the sofa\u2026\u2026\u2026he didn\u2019t even dare breathe.\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dSomeone suddenly spoke up.Invigilator 154 stopped and looked at the speaker.Yu Wen quickly poked his head out from behind You Huo.Unexpectedly, the person who spoke up was his alcoholic old man, Old Yu.\u201cIn\u2026\u2026In the first place, we weren\u2019t told how we should answer the question.\u201d Old Yu fearfully stuttered.\u201cThere are clues for all rules.\u201d 154 said.\u201cWhere are the clues?\u201dNo. 154 looked at him expressionlessly: \u201cI\u2019m not an examinee.\u201d\u201cBu-but we didn\u2019t know! We\u2019re not guilty if we didn\u2019t know\u2026\u2026..\u201d Old Yu\u2019s voice got smaller and smaller and it eventually turned into the sound of a mosquito.No. 154: \u201cThat has nothing to do with us.\u201dWith a deadpanned face, No. 154 continued with his job: \u201cWe only punish the relevant personnel who violated the rules. The others can continue to take the exam.\u201dAs he said that, he pulled out a white note. He read the scribbled information on it.\u201cAccording to our sources, the offender was a middle-aged man and a young girl\u2014\u2014-\u201dHe turned to look at Mr. 001. He then looked back at the note and stopped for a few seconds. With a firm expression, he repeated: \u201cA middle-aged man and a lady. The two offenders, please come with us.\u201dAs he said that, the other invigilator had already picked up the bald man from the sofa and dragged him over to the door like a dead dog.The door was opened and cold air rushed in.Snow particles covered their faces and everyone in the room screamed and shrank over to the fire stove. It was as if they would be smouldered into dust if the snow touched them.Everyone watched as invigilator No. 922 stepped out with the bald man and disappeared into the snowstorm.Left behind was the bald man\u2019s fearful screams and a small water stain on the ground.No. 154 continued with his deadpanned expression: \u201cThere\u2019s also another girl, uh, woman\u2026\u2026\u201dHe looked up and scanned the room with furrowed brows.Old Yu and two good-hearted old ladies took advantage of the chaos earlier to hide Yu Yao behind them but they trembled like a leaf.No. 154\u2019s eyes was just about to look over when Mr. 001 pointed his chin at You Huo, \u201cThe other is him. Take him away.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201dNo. 154 looked down at the note.The sharply scribbled handwriting clearly read \u2014\u2014\u2013 Young girl.No. 154 looked at You Huo with a blank look.You Huo who was being looked at stared at Mr. 001 coldly.No. 154 was certain that if this cold-faced handsome guy had a knife in his hand, he would\u2019ve already cut off his boss\u2019s head.\u201cThis\u2014\u2013\u201dWhen he just wanted to speak, Mr. 001 who gave him his orders turned up his coat collar and walked out into the snowstorm.\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u00b7\u201cFuck! Brother!!\u201d\u201cDammit!! Why don\u2019t any of you speak any sense!!\u201d Old Yu exploded.\u201cIt\u2019s not him! It\u2019s me! Not him\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201d Yu Yao was stunned for a couple of seconds before quickly rushing out from behind everyone.However, when they looked over, the door was open. Snow continued to pour into the room along with gusts of wind.There was not a soul by the door.The three invigilators, along with the bald man and the wrongly accused You Huo, had disappeared without a sound.\u201cStop shouting! They\u2019re already gone. If you want, you can go chase after them!\u201d The tattooed man gnashed his teeth and strode over to slam the door shut. He even added two locks.The room went quiet. Old Yu\u2019s eyes were red. He slapped his thigh angrily and sat onto the floor.Yu Yao fell back onto the chair. She cried even more miserably.Ever since she entered this cabin, she had not stopped crying. She was about to finish crying out her entire lifetime of tears.Yu Wen stood stiffly facing the door with a pale face. He then turned around to pick his father up. With a frown, he said: \u201cMy brother left me a message.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Old Yu was shocked.That invigilator took him away so quickly yet You Huo was able to have time to leave a message?Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blog\u201cHe asked me to find a knife.\u201d Yu Wen said.\u201cWhat knife?\u201dYu Wen slowly shook his head. He didn\u2019t answer. Instead, he turned to look at the answer wall.Old Yu also looked over.His eyes slowly swept over the wall. Finally, it settled in one place.It was those thin knife marks.\u201cWho did that?\u201d Old Yu was stunned for a moment.Yu Wen: \u201cIt was there before. I saw it before the question was given.\u201dHe thought back for a moment and finally understood his brother\u2019s previous actions.\u201cI understand now.\u201dOld Yu was very confused: \u201cWhat do you know now?\u201d\u201cBrother earlier was constantly saying that he was looking for a pen, but he was holding an axe in his hand.\u201d Yu Wen looked at the knife marks on the wall and said, \u201cEarlier didn\u2019t that invigilator also say that there are clues for all rules? These knife marks are the clues.\u201dThe ink couldn\u2019t leave traces on the wall but a knife can.So it is the so-called pen.Old Yu\u2019s eyes brightened. He let out a sigh: \u201cSure enough, he\u2019s still very good.\u201dYu Wen: \u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s find a knife! At least we can be of help.\u201dOld Yu wanted to turn around to let the others know of this news, but his mouth was covered by Yu Wen.\u201cNo, no, no, don\u2019t!\u201dYu Wen pretended to be comforting Old Yu. He patted Old Yu\u2019s back and said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. My brother will be fine!\u201dOld Yu was about to vomit out blood from his smacks.He again said in an extremely small voice: \u201cBrother said that the knife was hidden away.\u201d\u00b7The snow got stronger.Wind would randomly blow from all directions. Everywhere outside was misty, and you couldn\u2019t see the outlines of the mountains and trees. In the distance, you could see faint lights.You Huo walked through the snow with a cold expression.When he was pushed out the door, the cabin behind him disappeared. Even if he wanted to go back, he couldn\u2019t.But there was one thing that was confirmed \u2014\u2013 With the accompaniment of the invigilators, they wouldn\u2019t be turned into smithereens in the snow.But compared to the snow, the invigilators were more worrisome.The bald man was still in grief. He looked like he was at a funeral. Fortunately, they didn\u2019t go too far. Before they freezed to death, he finally saw a house.It was a very small western styled building which sat alone in the middle of the woods.In general, ghosts tend to like to inhabit these kinds of houses.\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d No. 154 pushed You Huo in.Under the light, You Huo\u2019s handsome face was stiff from the cold. His thin lips were pursed tight and his skin was cold and pale.This small building went through some sort of strange refurbishment and it was completely covered in murals and sculptures. Big and small, they covered every corner of the house. When they looked around, he found himself facing a pale, stiff face.The moment the bald man entered, he collapsed to the ground.Seeing that he was about to leave another pool of water, No. 922 didn\u2019t hesitate to drag him down the corridor.The bald man\u2019s cries came from that direction: \u201cWhat are you doing? I was wrong. I was wrong \u2014\u2014\u2013 I won\u2019t so anything bad anymore! What are you going to do?!\u201d\u201cAfraid?\u201dA deep voice suddenly rang by his ear.Mr. 001 who was standing next to You Huo while taking off his gloves, asked this casually.You Huo glanced at him and walked straight past him.No. 154 glanced at You Huo and then looked over at 001.\u201cWhy are you looking at me?\u201d Invigilator 001 pointed at the corridor with his chin. He said lazily: \u201cHurry and go. Someone can\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d\u00b7The little western building didn\u2019t look very big, but that corridor was very long.So long that people would begin to wonder if it there was something supernatural at play and you would never be able to get out.Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t an endless corridor.A few minutes later, 922 stopped his steps and opened a door. He pushed the bald man in and then locked it.You Huo finally opened his mouth and asked: \u201cWhat punishment?\u201dNo. 154 was stunned for a moment. He said: \u201cSolitary confinement.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe felt that these group of people may be addicted to playing house.He looked at No. 154.154: \u201cI\u2019m not lying. It really is solitary confinement.\u201dFor some reason, despite being an invigilator, when he said this his voice changed slightly and it was a little tense.\u201cYou\u2019re scared.\u201d You Huo said. \u201cYou were confined before?\u201d154 furrowed his brows: \u201cWhat am I afraid of? You should be more scared.\u201dWhen he finished saying this, he felt something strange under his foot. The sensation below the sole of his feet felt different. It seemed to feel a bit\u2026\u2026\u2026sticky.He then heard the faint sound of water.He looked down and saw a thick later of water seep out from under the door.Inside the door was the bald man.After being stunned for two seconds, he reacted. It was blood.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t die.\u201d 154 said. He opened another door on the opposite side and took advantage of the moment when You Huo is in thought to push him in: \u201cMake the most of your time.\u201dWhen he was done, he slammed the door shut. From outside, there was the clattering of a lock being put in place.You Huo heard his voice vaguely through the cracks between the doors: \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be so harsh for just using the wrong stationery. Solitary confinement will only let you experience the most fearful things in your life. I\u2019ll pick you up after three hours.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blog\u00b7On the second floor of the little western bulding, invigilator 001 sat on the arm chair with one hand supporting his chin.On the table was a metal bird stand and a pitch-black bird sat on it.His eyes fell onto the snow coated woods outside. While his finger rubbed the bird\u2019s head, there was no expression on his face. He was clearly extremely bored.Invigilator 922 was madly complaining: \u201cFucking hell, he pissed himself four times on the way there. I say one thing, he pisses himself. I say another thing and he pisses himself again!\u201dNo. 154 walked in shaking the paper in his hand: \u201cYoung girl! You wrote young girl yourself!\u201dHe could no longer maintain his deadpanned expression. If you lent him 100x courage, he would even be brave enough to shove the note into 001\u2019s face.Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t dare.However, after the two of them complained for a while they noticed that the person in the armchair wasn\u2019t responding. He continued to look out the window.\u201cBoss? Boss?\u201d 922 tried calling out a few times. Finally, he could only increase his volume: \u201cQin Jiu!\u201dMr. 001 finally returned to his senses.922 pulled 154 over to be scolded and quickly slipped back.154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dFuck you.Qin Jiu\u2019s eyes swept back and forth between the two of them: \u201cI wasn\u2019t paying attention earlier so I didn\u2019t hear. Complain again?\u201d154 shook his head: \u201cForget it.\u201d922 timidly walked up: \u201cBoss\u2026\u2026.What\u2019s wrong?\u201dQin Jiu raised his eyebrow: \u201cWhat is that senseless talk?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u2026..I just felt that you don\u2019t seem to be in a good mood.\u201d 922 said.\u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026.a little.\u201d 922 said: \u201cBecause you were dragged over to be an invigilator?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen why\u2026\u2026\u201d 154 muttered.\u201cSpeak louder. I didn\u2019t hear the second half.\u201d Qin Jiu glanced at him.When he used his pitch-black eyes to stare at others, the others would always feel uncomfortable. Even if 154 and 922 had followed him for almost 3 years, they still couldn\u2019t get used to it.154 once again shrank back. He cleared his throat and said: \u201cI said\u2026\u2026You are in a good mood so why did you drag someone who didn\u2019t violate the rules over? Isn\u2019t this a bit of a violation of the rules?\u201dQin Jiu said: \u201cI\u2019m following the rules. He had \u2018ink\u2019 on his hands. Didn\u2019t you see it?\u201d154 was stunned for a moment: \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t see it\u2026\u2026.\u201dQin Jiu rubbed the black bird\u2019s head and said: \u201cAlso\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d922 and 154 perked up their ears.However, their boss continued petting the bird for another 10 minutes and didn\u2019t say the next sentence.After a long pause, he said: \u201cForget it. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe two subordinates almost died from suffocation. They didn\u2019t dare rebel and quickly slipped away.\u00b7On the third floor of the small western building was a small attic. Inside there was a wall of screens which corresponded to each of the confinement rooms.The experiences of the people in the confinement rooms would be projected here. To some certain extent, you could see a lot of their secrets.But at this moment, there was a heavy lock on the door. No one came and peeked.Two screens were lit up. One was the room with the bald man, and the other was You Huo\u2019s room.The screen displaying the bald man\u2019s room was blurred with blood. Through the red film, you could faintly see a silhouette of a hanging figure and a deathly pale face.As for You Huo\u2019s side, the screen was completely normal.The screen displayed the original appearance of the room; three mirrors, a wall clock, a wooden table and chair, and that was it.\u00b7Three hours later, No. 154 came over to the confinement room with the keys.He prepared himself to be hit by flying arms and legs but when he opened the door, he was stunned.There was nothing in the confinement room and the cold-faced handsome guy who was confined in the room was asleep on the table.With his arms covering his face, he looked like he was a high school student taking a nap in class.The sound of 154 entering appeared to have woken him up.He frowned as he opened his eyes and he looked at 154 before closing it again. With a look of annoyance, he lazed around a little more before straightening up and leaning back on the chair. He asked: \u201cDone?\u201d154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dDid you want to sleep a little longer?????Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: Entering TwicePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen You Huo came out of the confinement room, the corridor was completely silent.The room opposite his containing the bald man had no noise. There was only blood flowing out from the room.He frowned slightly in disgust and walked around the blood stains.After for a short time, he suddenly stopped his steps.There was a strange feeling of being watched from the shadows. Like something was looking down at him. Like a pair of lifeless eyes staring at him quietly.You Huo looked up.Above him was a white ceiling. Apart from a dim light, there wasn\u2019t anything else.\u00b7\u201cOh fuck! I almost slept past the punishment time. That damned deadpanned face didn\u2019t\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201d Someone rushed down from upstairs and when he turned the corner, he quickly stepped onto his brakes.\u201cYou! Cough, you\u2019re out?\u201dYou Huo retracted his gaze from the ceiling.The person who came was invigilator 922.He looked at You Huo and immediately changed back into his official tone. He said a quick, \u201cExcuse me\u201d and stroke quickly down the corridor before opening the bloodstained door.After a moment, the bald man was taken out.922 carried the limp middle-aged man and walked with difficulty.\u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d He asked.You Huo stuffed his hand in his pocket and said lazily: \u201cWaiting for you. I have no interest in turning into smithereens.\u201d922: \u201cWhere\u2019s 154?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cWhere did that damned bastard slack off to?\u201d922 muttered lowly.He readjusted the bald man and didn\u2019t have the energy to complain. He tilted his head in the direction of the door and said: \u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019ll take you back to the examination centre.\u201d\u00b7Small western building, second floor.Qin Jiu crossed his arms and leaned lazily against the window. His eyes looked down.The light from the room projected out into the woods as he watched 992 take the two examinees into the snowstorm.Qin Jiu narrowed his eyes and seemed to be in thought as he looked in the distance.The back bird suddenly let out a hoarse cry.After a moment, Qin Jiu finally grunted and stood up.He walked over to the desk and played with the black bird\u2019s beak. While feeding it some grains, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t you think something is missing?\u201dThe black bird hoarsely cried out: \u201cAh.\u201dQin Ji: \u201cAn invigilator?\u201dBlack bird: \u201cAh.\u201dQin Jiu knocked on the bird\u2019s beak and then moved to go downstairs.Before he took more than two steps, the black bird flapped its wings and followed.He looked around the hall and turned down into the corridor. He could faintly hear the sound of a chair moving in one of the confinement rooms. It was the room You Huo was confined in earlier.Qin Jiu raised his eyebrow. He knocked on the door three times: \u201cAnyone here?\u201dThe chair inside clattered a few times.Qin Jiu: \u201cCan I go in?\u201dThe chair inside slammed on the floor.Qin Jiu unlocked the door.The moment the door opened, he saw the missing Invigilator No. 154. He was tied to the chair with his hands behind him and there was a large ball of paper in his mouth.On the paper, someone had calmly used a marker to write a few words: Who\u2019s a fucking woman.Qin Jiu suddenly laughed.154 wanted to slam the chair again to remind Qin Jiu to free him firstbut, when he saw Qin Jiu laugh, he felt a little scared and gently placed the chair down again.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogSince it was a curse, Qin Jiu didn\u2019t appreciate it for too long.After a moment, 154 was finally freed from the ropes.He massaged his red wrists and complained: \u201cI\u2019ve been an invigilator for three years and I haven\u2019t seen an examinee like him! The others would cry and beg and yet he just sleeps? Others wouldn\u2019t dare provoke invigilators and he just tied me up without any fear!\u201dQin Jiu sat at the desk listening. He then said lazily, \u201cYour complaints almost rhyme. Continue.\u201d154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dIf possible, he wanted to shove the paper ball with the curse at his boss.\u201cAs an invigilator, you were locked in the confinement room by an examinee. Don\u2019t you find it shameful?\u201d Qin Jiu narrowed his eyes and asked.152 maintained a stiff deadpanned expression: \u201cDammit. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t let 922 see. Otherwise he would laugh at me for two years straight.\u201dThose who are familiar with the mechanics of this system knew that invigilators were selected from previous examinees. Only the top elites would be able to change their identity.These people were also ranked according to their level and strength and it was the also the invigilators number.If the number is a single digit, they are the top of the top. No one would dare provoke them.For example, 001.\u201cYou said earlier that\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Qin Jiu hesitated for a moment. He seemed to be trying to think of an adjective. He eventually raised an eyebrow and said: \u201cThat examinee was sleeping in the confinement room?\u201d\u201cYes. When I went in, everything was the same as usual. After staying in the confinement room, anything can happen but to him it was like there were no changes. He didn\u2019t have anything that he feared.\u201d154 thought for a moment. He then wondered: \u201cBut is this possible? How can there be such a person? I have only seen one person like that in my entire lifetime.\u201dQin Jiu narrowed his eyes. He used his finger to stroke the beak of the black bird sitting on his shoulder.\u201cMaybe his life has been too smooth sailing and he hasn\u2019t encountered anything that he is scared of?\u201d 154 guessed. \u201cBut no matter how smooth sailing it is, it will only last until today. This group of examinees must have been out of luck for them to encounter this type of toothpaste-like problem as their first question.\u201dQin Jiu quietly glanced at him.\u201cThe problem is like squeezing out toothpaste. You squeeze one out, you get another. I don\u2019t know if this is some kind of bug.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cWho came up with that ridiculous name?\u201d\u201c922 that fool did. It has nothing to do with me.\u201d 154 spoke stiffly. He continued, \u201cBut it\u2019s just an analogy. Back when I did the exams, I feared these questions the most! It wasn\u2019t that difficult but the amount of information you get at the beginning was a complete zero. You couldn\u2019t figure out how to earn points, so I automatically affected defeat for the first round of answer submission. It was fated for one of our companions to become sacrifice\u201d154 thought back for a moment and then fearfully muttered: \u201cThankfully, I only encountered it once and wasn\u2019t selected\u2026\u2026..I wonder who will be the sacrifice in this group of examinees?\u201dHe looked at the time: \u201cOnly a few seconds left.\u201d\u00b7Before the cabin on the snow mountain.The exhausted 922 no longer cared about his face. While gasping for air he stopped You Huo who walked ahead of him.\u201cNeed something?\u201d You Huo looked annoyed.It was about time for the first answer submission. Through the roaring snowstorm, he could sense the panic inside the cabin.Even a second couldn\u2019t be delayed.922 said: \u201cThere\u2019s still another rule. As a person who had been confined, the two of you cannot answer when the answer is being collected for this round.\u201dYou Huo\u2019s expression turned even colder.922 waved his hand: \u201cDon\u2019t glare at me. Anyway, the first round for these types of questions are usually death questions. If you don\u2019t score any points\u2014\u2014-\u201dHe wasn\u2019t done speaking but You Huo had already turned around and opened the door.The moment hot air poured out, the rooster started to let out a cry.It was time for their responses to be collected.The bald man fell onto his knees in fear. He quickly crawled over to the corner and trembled with unfocused eyes.His actions took the lead, and several people in the room also followed suit.Yu Wen half knelt on the floor with his knees suppressing the tattooed man below him. He was holding something in his hand that appeared to have just been taken away.With the rooster\u2019s cry, he looked over in confusion. He raised his hand and muttered: \u201cBrother, I found the knife, but time is\u2026\u2026up?\u201dAnd then?Everyone sat on the ground stunned. They were so scared they almost forgot to breathe.The rooster cries made them panic.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blog\u201cReally\u2026\u2026.Will be evicted from the exam centre?\u201d Someone murmured quietly.Then they will be blasted into smithereens outside in the snowstorm? Just like that tin can that was thrown out earlier?Bang!!The locked door suddenly blew open and it forcefully slammed into the wall.Everyone flinched.Outside, 922 who had not yet left stood still.A sudden gust of wind blew in. Like a plane that was flying at a high altitude suddenly opening its door, a strong suction force pulled the people inside the room towards the door.\u201cAhhh\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201dOld Yu cried out in shock. He suddenly fell to the ground and started to slip over towards the door.It was as if there was an invisible hand pulling him by his ankle and dragging him out.\u00b7\u201cThe answer submission will only be over after the rooster cries 9 times.\u201d\u201cAlso, there\u2019s a little trick for this dumb first round question. Hah\u2026..It\u2019s quite shameless.\u201dThese two phrases suddenly appeared in You Huo\u2019s mind.You Huo didn\u2019t have the time to think too deeply about it. He grabbed the knife in Yu Wen\u2019s hand and jumped over the long table that was in the way. He stood in front of the answer wall.As the rooster let out its last cry, he scribbled a word:Answer.922 outside the door: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dIs this trick also okay???It really was okay.The rooster cries and the snowstorm abruptly stopped.Old Yu whose head was at the edge of the door had lost most of the hair at the top of his head. Yu Wen who was hugging his dad\u2019s leg rolled pathetically on the ground.Their hearts thumped furiously, and their pale faces had a look of confusion. They then turned to look at the answer wall.After what felt like almost a century, a red mark appeared next to the rough scribble \u201cAnswer\u201d:2Everyone was shocked.922 was dumbfounded.He stood in the cold for a few seconds and then rushed back to report.\u00b7It took a moment for the others in the room to digest what had happened.They slowly climbed up from the ground and stood on their jelly-like legs.\u201cMan, what is this. Scared me to death\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Old Yu fixed up his hair that had become bald in the centre. There was a light wound on his scalp too where blood flowed down from but fortunately, he was still alive.Yu Wen released his hold of his father\u2019s leg. He laid sprawled on the ground in daze.After a few seconds, he suddenly sat up and smacked his mouth: \u201cLook at this pig head of mine! How could I have forgotten something like this?! My teacher would always remind us before an exam that even if we cannot answer the question, we should still write the word \u2018answer\u2019. Just that word alone is worth 2 points!!! Brother, how can you be so clever?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dYou Huo wordlessly stored away the knife. He didn\u2019t see that as a praise.In order to prevent the idiot from continuing to talk about the word \u2018answer\u2019, he finally spoke up and asked: \u201cWho took the knife?\u201dWhen he mentioned the knife, Yu Wen\u2019s expression immediately turned sour: \u201cWho else?!\u201dHe pointed at the tattooed man and said: \u201cHim! We found it on him! I knew there was something wrong with him. While the others were trying to find clues, he was hoarding all kinds of weapons like a bear preparing for hibernation. If not for Ms. Yu Yao bumping into him and knocking the knife out during the commotion, who knows when we would find it?!\u201dAs he recalled what happened moments earlier, he couldn\u2019t help but shudder.If that commotion didn\u2019t happen, if they were just a little bit more unlucky and the found the knife a second too late, if You Huo didn\u2019t come back before their responses are collected\u2026..Then his father Old Yu\u2026\u2026The tattooed man was tied up to the chair as everyone interrogated him.At this moment, the answer wall suddenly changed.Topic: A group of travellers came to a snow mountain and stayed overnight at a small hunter\u2019s cabin.Question: I have 13 tableware, but food is limited and only 12 can be accommodated. The tableware hide a secret and one of you is destined to die. Will you be spared? This is actually not very difficult, after all optics is the most magical thing in the world.Requirements: Find the that cursed tableware. (But cannot damage them)Knowledge being tested: OpticsEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dJust as everyone was looking at the problem, a line of words appeared below.Violation warning: A punished examinee broke the rules and answered the question. The invigilator has been notified.Invigilator: 001, 154, 922Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u00b7Ten minutes later.On the second floor of the small western building, inside the invigilator\u2019s office.An invigilator and a rule violating examinee who had returned a second time looked at each other silently.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dAfter a long time, the invigilator playing with the pen snorted. He looked up lazily and asked: \u201cDo you plan on living here?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: GifPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaytYou Huo slouched over on the sofa. Crossing his two long legs, he nonchalantly played with his earring.Hearing Qin Jiu\u2019s words, he lifted his half-lidded eyes and it coldly swept past the other person\u2019s face before looking back down again.No explanation, no reflection, no regard for him.This attitude of his was clearly the most difficult type to deal with.\u00b7When 154 entered his boss\u2019s office, he felt a strong sense of suffocation.\u201cYou were looking for me?\u201dThere was an examinee in the room so 154\u2019s expression was even more serious. His words were accompanied by respect.\u201cWhat\u2019s the punishment for the second violation?\u201d Qin Jiu slowly turned the pen in his hand and looked at him, \u201cI haven\u2019t been here for a while, so I don\u2019t remember well.\u201d154 fell silent for a moment. He then said: \u201cSolitary confinement.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dYou Huo\u2019s fingers moved and he finally looked up.His expression was still very cold. Apart from laziness, there weren\u2019t any other emotions but for 154, he felt like he was being ridiculed.Perhaps it was in the genes.Or perhaps their boss just had a tendency to attract these types of people.Qin Jiu: \u201cApart from solitary confinement, there\u2019s nothing else?\u201d154 opened his mouth.Something in the room went \u2018beep\u2019.You Huo\u2019s gaze moved and it fell onto Qin Jiu\u2019s wrist. Something over there lit up. The sound seemed to be coming from there.154 said: \u201cYou see, adding punishments is against the rules.\u201dQin Jiu lowered his eyes and casually adjusted his shirt cuffs. That faint light dimmed back down.When he looked up again, his eyes met with You Huo\u2019s.\u201cOnly having a table and chair in the confinement room is a bit boring.\u201d He looked at You Huo but his words were directed at 154.154 nodded: \u201cIndeed.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay with him? At least there\u2019s something to do.\u201d154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWho are you punishing?Qin Jiu laughed: \u201cJust kidding. Don\u2019t take it too seriously.\u201d154 had already grown accustomed to his ability to spout out unpredictable bastard lines. He quickly breathed a sigh of relief and said: \u201cThen\u2026\u2026..I\u2019ll take him downstairs to sleep for another three hours and then take him back when it\u2019s over?\u201d\u201cIs this place a hotel?\u201d154 didn\u2019t speak back.He waited for a while, but he didn\u2019t receive any new instructions. He casually glanced over.On the sofa, You Huo was looking out the window. Not knowing if he was just in daze or something, he had a \u201cdo whatever you want, if you kill me then I lose\u201d expression. His attitude was cold and arrogant.As for his boss Qin Jiu\u2026\u2026\u2026He had his hands clasped loosely together as he watched You Huo\u2019s pale side profile.154 felt that, for this extremely difficult to deal with examinee, his boss probably grew curious about him but for some reason his boss also didn\u2019t seem to be in a very good mood.\u201cBoss?\u201d 154 reminded him.Only after a while, Qin Jiu looked back. He suggested to 154: \u201cGo trick another examinee into violating the rules and confine them together.\u201dPlease support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blog154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat nonsense are you speaking?The wrist once again let out a \u2018beep\u2019.It was probably the same as earlier, an indication and warning. 154 kept his mouth closed. Qin Jiu didn\u2019t seem to mind.\u201cNot confining. Just send him away?\u201d\u2018Beep\u2019.Qin Jiu snorted.He thought about it and asked 154: \u201cHave you cleaned the confinement room that was used earlier yet?\u201d154 glanced at You Huo. He was very confused: \u201cThere was something that needed to be cleaned up?? The ropes have been stored away, the paper ball with the curses have also been thrown away.\u201dHearing the word paper ball, You Huo\u2019s hand that was fiddling with his earring stopped for a second but he continued to look outside with a cold expression while pretending to be both deaf and mute.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cThe other room.\u201d154: \u201cOh, no not yet. I originally wanted to clean it up, but the rule violations happened too closely together so 922 and I haven\u2019t been able to deal with it.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s let this special guest\u2026\u2026.\u201d Qin Jiu stopped. He looked at You Huo, \u201cWhat should I call you?\u201dYou Huo coldly humphed.\u201cLet Mr. Humph go clean it up.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeeing that a murder case was about to happen in the office, 154 quickly responded and led the dangerous man downstairs.\u00b7Downstairs utility room.922 and 154 were picking and choosing through the equipment. The examinee who was going to go through the punishment leaned against the door with his arms crossed and expression gloomy.\u201cDon\u2019t have such a bad expression. If you really fought, you definitely won\u2019t be able to beat him.\u201d 922 said.Perhaps it was because the word \u201canswer\u201d was just too amazing, 922\u2019s attitude towards You Huo had changed a little. His tone was no longer as official as before.You Huo didn\u2019t say anything but from his expression you could tell that he thinks he\u2019s bullshitting.\u201cDid you think that he\u2019s called 001 just for show?\u201d 922 said, \u201cWhen I first met boss\u2026..Which one was it? It was in a military base somewhere, I can\u2019t remember anymore. Anyway, it was a whole street! A whole street covered in blood. In his hands he was carrying some type of bazooka\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cGo find your bucket.\u201d 154 sternly interrupted his words.\u201cOh.\u201d922 had not completely reminisced his past experience and was forced to stop under 154\u2019s firm look. He said to You Huo: \u201cYou can go over first. I\u2019ll take the bucket over later.\u201d\u00b7You Huo and 154 went down the long corridor first.\u201cThose blood all need to be cleaned.\u201d 154 pointed at the blood on the ground. He then unlocked the confinement room that held the bald man earlier.\u201cYou used to be an examinee?\u201d You Huo suddenly spoke up.154 hesitated. He nodded: \u201cYes, several years back.\u201d\u201cHow did you turn into an invigilator?\u201d154 considered it for a moment: \u201cSuccessfully passing the exam, excellent results.\u201dYou Huo wrinkled his eyebrows: \u201cWhat exactly is this exam?\u201d154 looked at him. He answered vaguely: \u201cA sort of\u2026\u2026\u2026.special screening I guess. Exams are all like this.\u201dYou Huo said sarcastically: \u201cScreening? Looking for the bravest champion?\u201dAs they spoke, he once again felt the same sensation from earlier of being watched.You Huo looked up but only saw a white ceiling. There wasn\u2019t anything that was looking down at him from above.\u201cWhat kind of people would be pulled into this?\u201d He ignored that feeling and continued to ask.154 thought about it: \u201cExtremely dangerous people.\u201dYou Huo remained expressionless.154 recalled the room filled with the old, weak and pregnant. He then said: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026But it sometimes might not be very accurate.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cWhat is this? Supernatural event?\u201d154 shook his head: \u201cIt\u2019s not a supernatural event, it\u2019s \u2014\u2014\u2013\u201d\u2018Beep\u2019.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogIt was that sound again.You Huo looked back and thought that the annoying invigilator 001 had followed over.Seeing that there wasn\u2019t anyone behind him, he realised that the sound came from 154.154 rubbed his finger.On his index finger, he wore a silver ring. A red warning light glowed faintly from below the ring. When he saw that red light, he immediately shut his mouth.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d You Huo asked, \u201cThat 001 guy earlier had it too.\u201d\u201cWarning for breaking the rules.\u201d 154 turned the ring around to block the light.\u201cYou also have constraints and regulations?\u201d\u201cOf course! More than enough!\u201d 922\u2019s voice travelled over.He carried a metal bucket and stepped over the bloodstains, \u201cForbidden to talk about dangerous topics, forbidden to abuse power and bully examinees, forbidden to help examinees to cheat, forbidden to have a relationship with examinees\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, of course that is basically impossible.\u201d 922 said, \u201cIt\u2019s good enough if you don\u2019t get into a fight. If you really fought, the invigilator is prohibited from killing the examinee\u2026\u2026.and so on.\u201d\u201cCan an examinee kill an invigilator?\u201d You Huo asked.922: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cSo, what are the consequences of violating those rules?\u201d154\u2019s face paled.922 who was relatively easy to speak with fell silent for a few seconds. He then smiled awkwardly and said: \u201cDon\u2019t ask. Anyway, it\u2019s very scary. I haven\u2019t experienced it yet, and I also don\u2019t want to experience it in the future.\u201d\u201cSo, don\u2019t ask anymore dangerous questions. Isn\u2019t it better to be safe?\u201d 922 placed the metal bucket down in front of You Huo, \u201cPass the exam properly and try to get out alive. These are the things you should focus on.\u201d\u00b7154 no longer spoke. He unlocked the confinement room.The moment the door opened, strong odour travelled out.In addition to blood, there were some residues stuck on the ground and walls.You Huo had a disgusted expression: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Do you usually clean the confinement rooms?\u201d\u201cOf course not by hand.\u201d 922 pinched his nose and said, \u201cOtherwise what\u2019s the difference from that and punishing us?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bit disgusting but cleaning is better than solitary confinement.\u201dYou Huo looked coldly at him.922 said cautiously: \u201cUh\u2026\u2026for you, it would at least be better than sharing a room with our boss right?\u201dWhen he was done, he ran off while dragging 154 behind him.The corridor was silent again.\u00b7Proper cleaning was impossible.You Luo leaned against the door and coldly scanned the room. He then picked up the bucket of water and poured it directly into the room.The water washed away part of the blood, and some of the residue\u2019s stuck on the floor and walls were also washed off.You Huo bent down and examined a piece in front of him. Looking carefully, it looked like bone and on top of it was long black hair.What horrific scenes does that bald man have in his mind?You Huo suppressed his disgust and coldly entered the room.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The whole room was cleaned up, and the bloody water and residue filled up a whole bucket.At the very top of it was a pile of hair and a piece of skin that came from who knows where. The skin had become pale from soaking to the point that it even looked a little fake.On it was a small tattoo that was particularly conspicuous. It was a small and simple bellflower.\u00b7After three hours, 922 once again set off and brought You Huo back to the examination centre.Qin Jiu stretched a little and decided to go find 154 to get some food. When he opened the office door, a bucket of bloody water and flesh residue was placed respectfully outside. Next to it was a small torn off piece of paper with slender scribbled handwriting. It wrote:Gift for you. You\u2019re welcome.154\u2019s voice travelled over: \u201cBoss, I\u2019m thinking of grilling some meat. What do you want to eat?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.I won\u2019t be hungry today.\u201d154: \u201c???\u201d922 turned around the corner with oven gloves on and stared at the bloody bucket for a total of three seconds. He said: \u201cI think I won\u2019t be hungry for the rest of my life.\u201dQin Jiu took off the piece of paper and examined it for while as he leaned against the wall. He asked 154: \u201cWhat\u2019s the punishment if the same examinee violates the rules the third time?\u201dHe asked this slowly and he even dragged out some of the words. It was as if he was carelessly trying to challenge something.154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026There shouldn\u2019t be a third time?\u201d\u201cWhat if.\u201d154 said carefully: \u201cThe one being punished is us\u2026\u2026\u2026.All invigilators for full time on-site invigilating.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe building went scarily quiet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, a few seconds later he regretted this decision. You Huo came out again.922 with a look of frustration: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong now?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cI just thought of something.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe rules here, are they based on the exams in reality?\u201d922 nodded: \u201cOf course it is.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cThere was a rule that wasn\u2019t mentioned.\u201d922: \u201cWhich?\u201d\u201cIf an examinee encounters a problem, can they also find the invigilator?\u201d922: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dBut we don\u2019t want you to look for us.To avoid trouble, 922 immediately added: \u201cIt\u2019s the same as the exams in reality. You are forbidden to ask for the answer. We don\u2019t and can\u2019t help you with that.\u201dYou Huo made a sound of recognition.But he had always been quite little with words\u2026\u2026.922 still felt skeptical.\u201cSo when we encounter a problem, how do we find you?\u201d922 said: \u201cJust\u2026\u2026.Use the delegated pen and write on the answer wall\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dHe originally wanted to say \u2018write the invigilators number\u2019 but he felt resistance inside. His mouth changed and the words that came out was, \u201cWrite 001.\u201dYou Huo looked expressionlessly at him.922 looked at him innocently and repeated: \u201cYes, write 001.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter what felt like a century, You Huo nodded. He then turned around and closed the door on him.922 who had managed to make a big achievement happily went back.\u00b7In the cabin.The fire was still burning strongly, and everyone sat around it in clearly separated groups.Because of the knife incident earlier, the tattooed man was left alienated. Alone, he sat at the corner of the table with a sullen face.The others sat far from him and would deliberately walk around him.Seeing You Huo returning, Yu Wen immediately jumped up.\u201cBrother! Did the invigilators do anything to you? What punishment? Are you okay?\u201dHe waved the knife around and fired out a succession of questions.Everyone looked over.You Huo furrowed his brows and moved away from the blade. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cYou sure?\u201d Yu Wen didn\u2019t believe him.He glanced at the corner of the room and asked quietly: \u201cThat person was taken away once and he became like that. How harsh was the punishment?\u201dYou Huo looked over at the corner of the room. The bald man who was confined earlier huddled there with yellow and turbid eyes. He swayed his body back and forth nervously as he muttered incoherently.He seemed to have been scared mad.You Huo saw the bald man and recalled the confinement room. He instantly felt a little sick.\u201cHe has always been like that?\u201d\u201cYes. It has been three hours and he didn\u2019t recover at all.\u201d Yu Wen snorted coldly. He then whispered: \u201cSee him constantly mumbling? I even went over to listen in.\u201d\u201cWhat did he say?\u201dYu Wen shook his head and said: \u201cI only heard something like \u2018unfortunate life\u2019. On there was also something about burning incense. I couldn\u2019t understand the rest.\u201dYou Huo made a sound of understanding and no longer asked.You got punished more than him so why do you seem okay?\u201d Yu Wen was very curious.You Huo was lazy to explain. He answered perfunctorily: \u201cMethod is different.\u201dYu Wen: \u201cWhat punishment did you get?\u201dYou Huo answered briefly: \u201cSlept. Gifted the invigilator a bucket of blood.\u201dYu Wen: \u201c???\u201d\u201cWhy did you gift the invigilator blood?\u201dYou Huo looked coldly at him: \u201cWho knows? He likes it.\u201dYu Wen keenly noted that his brother said \u2018he\u2019, not \u2018they\u2019.\u201cWhich one? Is he a pervert?\u201d\u201cYou Huo: \u201c001.\u201dYu Wen: \u201cHuh\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u00b7You Huo and that invigilator were not in good relations and he didn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore.He glanced around, and frowned: \u201cWere you just sitting around for the past three hours?\u201d\u201cHow can that be?\u201d Yu Wen pointed at the answer wall and said: \u201cBrother, your solution inspired me so I went and wrote a few things.\u201dYou Huo looked at the answer wall.On it there were densely packed scrawls made by by Yu Wen.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dYu Wen said: \u201cMy teacher said that we should write anything that comes to mind. Even if you don\u2019t know, while you\u2019re writing it down you might pick up a few points inadvertently.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cSo, you wrote an essay?\u201dHe tried to read the messy scrawls. He pointed at one of the lines and asked: \u201cWhat is this sentence?\u201dYu Wen tried to read it with even more difficulty than You Huo: \u201cI think\u2026\u2026.We have a total of 13 people and there are 12 tableware.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026..Why are you copying the question?Yu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026When I don\u2019t have anything to write in an exam, in order to increase the word count, I would try to emphasise the key point in the question.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dFuck you and the key point.He pointed to another pile of circles: \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dYu Wen: \u201cG=mg, g=9.8N/kg\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cWhat does this have to do with optics?\u201dYu Wen: \u201cThe thing is\u2026\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t know what kind relationship tableware has with optics.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dYu Wen was afraid of his brother going mad with anger, so he quickly added: \u201cThere are also optics here.\u201dYou Huo no longer wanted to look at the nonsensical scrawls. He asked directly, \u201cWhere?\u201dPlease support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogYou Wen said timidly: \u201cHere. I wrote refractive index, parallel lines, spherical surface, lens, focal length, imaging\u2026\u2026\u2026Aren\u2019t these words all optics related? I even drew a simple two mirror diagram.\u201dYou Huo was expressionless. Yu Wen thought about it and then pulled his brother away from the wall. He changed the topic: \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about the unhappy things. Apart from answering the question, we also did something else.\u201dIn fact, after the answer wall was updated, they turned the cabin upside down.The question said that this was a hunter\u2019s cabin and that he had 13 tableware but only enough food to feed 12.But after searching through the attic, cabinets and various bottles and cans, they firstly didn\u2019t see a hunter and, secondly, there weren\u2019t any tableware. As for food\u2026\u2026..They could only dream.\u201cWe searched for two hours.\u201d Yu Wen said dejectedly, \u201cIn such a small cabin, two hours! So you can imagine how much we\u2019ve gone through. There really was nothing. What a shit question.\u201dYou Huo asked: \u201cYou definitely went through everything?\u201d\u201cIn fact, we didn\u2019t.\u201d A stick thin man wearing a hospital gown coughed a few times and interjected: \u201cThere were two places that weren\u2019t touched.\u201dHe raised his skinny fingers and pointed at the two locked rooms.On the door of the rooms was the rooster and hen. Its necks were twisted, and their dark beady eyes looked out the window not moving an inch.Perhaps it was because the chickens looked very strange and every time, they called out it was either because of a violation or because it was time to collect the answers, no one dared to touch it.\u201cWe tried to find the key, but we couldn\u2019t find it.\u201dYou Huo nodded. He walked over and examined the two padlocks. He then turned around and looked at the walls.Yu Wen was worried that his brother would take out the axe to break the door down. He quickly said: \u201cBrother! I played these types of games more than everyone else here. For locked doors like this, it\u2019s best not to use force.\u201dYou Huo coolly asked back: \u201cDo I look retarded?\u201dYu Wen shrank back. He didn\u2019t dare speak.After a moment he said timidly: \u201cThen why are you looking at the wall?\u201d\u201cDid anyone touch the hunting gear?\u201d You Huo asked.Everyone\u2019s eyes moved to the tattooed man.\u201cFuck, why are you fucking looking at me for!\u201d The tattooed man saw this and was enraged: \u201cEarlier you wrongly accused me of hiding the knife and now what are you going to wrongly accuse me of?\u201d\u201cWrongly accuse?\u201d You Huo frowned.\u201cWith so many people are grouped together, who the fuck knows where that knife fell from.\u201d The tattooed man cursed. He said irritably: \u201cI\u2019m done! It\u2019s no point explaining to you fools!\u201dYou Huo looked coldly at him.Tattooed man: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dAfter a moment of silence, the tattooed man said: \u201cForget it. You\u2026\u2026what do you want to ask? Ask!\u201dYou Huo pointed at the wall with his chin: \u201cPut the hunting gear back to where it was. I want to look at its position.\u201dThe tattooed man glared at him: \u201cAm I crazy? Why should I put it back after taking it down?\u201d\u2022Three minutes later, the tattooed man took out a bag of hunting gear and hung them back one by one.You Huo crossed his arms and followed behind him.\u201cI\u2019m not a dog. Can you not walk around like you\u2019re walking me?!\u201dThe tattooed man complained dissatisfiedly but he still placed the last one back before spitting in the corner and walking away.\u201cBrother, what\u2019s wrong with the hunting gear?\u201d Yu Wen asked.You Huo pointed at the last wall and said: \u201cThere are two empty nails.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d Yu Wen was still puzzled.\u201d\u201cWhat happened to the thing hanging from there?\u201dThe room went silent.Suddenly someone said: \u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u2026\u2026it\u2019s missing two things. Is anyone hiding something?\u201dEveryone shook their heads.Old Yu: \u201cIt was like this from the beginning.\u201dEveryone looked at him.\u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u2026.Before the exam started, didn\u2019t I go out for a bit?\u201d Old Yu said to You Huo. \u201cYou were sleeping so I didn\u2019t call you. Before I went out, I wanted to see if there were any umbrellas in the cabin. At that time the two nails were empty. I\u2019m certain.\u201d\u201cSo, you mean that from the time we entered the cabin, two hunting gears were missing?\u201d\u201cThen who has it?\u201d\u201cThe hunter?\u201d Yu Wen guessed, \u201cSo\u2026\u2026There really is a hunter and he is just not in the cabin. He probably went out hunting?\u201dEveryone was a little nervous: \u201cWe can\u2019t go out, he can\u2019t come in. How can we find him?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cTime isn\u2019t up yet, right?\u201d\u00b7Everyone\u2019s sense of time was a bit off but You Huo had already dragged a chair over and moved to sit before the fire.The others also sat down and went in daze as they looked at the fire.Yu Yao supported her waist and carefully moved over. She looked at You Huo for a while. The other person\u2019s side profile was lit up by the fire making him look gentler than usual, but his eyes were still cold and indifferent.With a look of guilt, she said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dYou Huo looked over at her.Yu Yao said in a small voice: \u201cThat ink\u2026..Clearly I was the one who did it but you got punished instead. I have always wanted to apologise to you but you were taken away again before I could say anything.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dYu Yao said: \u201cI know it\u2019s useless to apologise. If there is anything next time, I\u2019ll go instead.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe lowered his eyes and glanced at Yu Yao. He looked away and continued to warm his hands up: \u201cNo need.\u201dYu Yao opened her mouth wanting to say something but in the end she didn\u2019t say anything.She sat there in daze for a while. Then she suddenly asked You Huo: \u201cYou\u2019re not afraid?\u201dYou Huo straightened one leg. The fire stove was too warm, and he was a little sleepy.He was quiet for a moment before saying lazily: \u201cAfraid of what?\u201d\u201cAfraid of death, afraid of violating the rules\u2026\u2026.or anything. Everyone is very curious. You are very strong. It\u2019s like you aren\u2019t afraid of anything.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of being afraid?\u201dYu Yao nodded and said quietly: \u201cThat\u2019s true. But you can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m just very scared\u2026\u2026.\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t look up. He said: \u201cYou\u2019re not too timid. You even had the courage to use that unknown ink to write on the wall.\u201dHe spoke effortlessly. It was as if he didn\u2019t want to even move his lips. His voice was low and cold but, while being baked by the warm fire, there was no tone of blame.Yu Yao lowered her head. She didn\u2019t know what to say.She lingered for a long time before saying: \u201cI actually\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dBut she didn\u2019t finish speaking. She saw You Huo with one leg on the edge of the chair and his arm on his knee. He seemed to have fallen asleep again.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogShe was surprised for a moment and she swallowed her words back. She didn\u2019t wake You Huo and just slowly moved back to the two old ladies.\u201cHow did he fall asleep again?\u201d The old lady whispered. \u201cDidn\u2019t he sleep when he just came?\u201dYu Wen heard this faintly and he looked at You Huo. Inside he answered: No, my brother is always sleepy even after sleeping.Yu Yao didn\u2019t say have much to say. She leaned against the old lady and her eyes looked into the distance. She seemed to be in thought.\u00b7An unknown amount of time passed and the clock above the cabinet changed.Beijing time, four o\u2019clock in the morning.The sudden cry from the rooster frightened everyone.They quickly sat up and looked at each other before realising that they had fallen asleep.Yu Wen slapped himself a few times to wake himself up.When he lowered his hands, he heard a strange sound.\u201cShh\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201dHe gestured and asked quietly: \u201cDo you hear something?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Old Yu looked at his son thinking that he was speaking nonsense.\u201cDon\u2019t you hear it?\u201d Yu Wen asked, \u201cThat\u2026\u2026crunching sound.\u201dThe room fell silent. No one dared to move.Everyone had a wary expression as they listened for movement.Sure enough, after a few seconds the crunching sound was heard again. This time everyone heard it.It was like\u2026\u2026something heavy being dragged in the snow.The stick thin man in the hospital gown gestured out the window and mouthed: \u201cHere.\u201dBefore his mouth could close, the door opened with a creak.A black shadow was cast in from outside the door.Following that, a pale faced man holding a bundle of rope entered the cabin.His figure was large, but he wasn\u2019t very tall. His face looked like over exposed paper and his eyes were also very strange. The iris looked a little too large for his eyes and the white sclera only occupied a very small amount.He bent down to roll the rope up. On his waist hung a wide knife and a small bell rang with his movements.No one in the room spoke. Everyone watched him drag a sack into the house and then closing the door.At this moment, he finally looked around at the fire stove. His dark eyes blinked a few times: \u201cAh\u2026\u2026.That\u2019s good, there are guests.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u00b7The one who came was the hunter that they had been waiting for.He squeezed his hand and said: \u201cSnow had blocked off the roads for the past few days so I knew that foo\u2026\u2026I mean, guests would come.\u201dGuests: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really cold outside.\u201d He said slowly: \u201cThe snow is too heavy. Everything was hidden so I couldn\u2019t find a prey. I spent a long, long time to finally dig out one.\u201dHe kicked the sack and smiled at everyone. His lips looked like they almost reached his ears: \u201cYou\u2019re really lucky to be able to join me.\u201dHe sighed again and explained: \u201cI can\u2019t help it. There aren\u2019t many things on the snow mountain, and it would always be a long time until I come across a group. I have to tighten my belly to survive so I only have two meals a day.\u201cOnce in the morning at 4am and then in the afternoon at 4pm. There aren\u2019t many chances to have a wonderful meal with me.\u201d He looked at the clock above the cabinet and said: \u201cAh, it\u2019s just the right time. You must\u2019ve waited long and must be hungry. I can hear your stomachs growling. Can\u2019t wait?\u201dGuests: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHow many of you are there?\u201d He held out his finger and counted them one by one, \u201cOld woman, sick man, thug, alcoholic, alcoholic\u2019s son\u2026\u2026.\u201dNone of the names were nice but when he pointed at them, their faces all turned green.When he reached You Huo, he paused and wasn\u2019t happy: \u201cWhy is there one still asleep.\u201d\u201cForget it.\u201d Hunter A was no longer interested. He looked at the answer well and said: \u201cLooks like there are a total of 13 people but I don\u2019t have enough food. Only enough for 12. What a pity.\u201dAs he said that, he licked his lips: \u201cI\u2019m really hungry, but you\u2019ll have to wait a little longer. I have to prepare. It\u2019s my first time having so many guests.\u201dYu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dIt\u2019s also my first time seen such a girly hunter.Hunter A bent over and picked up the sack.The sack looked particularly heavy. They didn\u2019t know what it contained and they also didn\u2019t want to know\u2026\u2026He dragged the sack over to the corner of the room and stopped before the room with the hen hanging from the door.The keys clanked and Hunter A picked one out. Using it, he opened the door to the room.A rotten smell spread out.It was a smell that was hard to describe. It was like rotten meat, dust and decaying wood all mixed together.\u00b7Everyone had thought that the room with the hen hanging from the door was the bedroom.Now they realised that it was actually a kitchen.Inside was a long counter. It was no problem for someone to lie on it.On the other side was a tall red wooden cabinet. Numerous locks hung from there.Hunter A smiled at the people in the room and then made a small bow: \u201cPlease wait. It\u2019ll be done soon.\u201dHe then closed the door.\u00b7The people by the fire stove was silent for a long time. One of them said with fear: \u201cI don\u2019t want to eat, I want to go home.\u201d\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to go home!\u201d The tattooed man had at some unknown point in time joined the crowd. He was probably afraid of Hunter A, \u201cCan we go back? If you have the ability, go and rush out through that door!\u201dEveryone fell silent again.After a moment, Old Yu swallowed: \u201cThat hunter\u2019s mouth was so big. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem to swallow a human head. I have a feeling he eats humans\u2026\u2026..\u201dYu Yao muttered: \u201cWhat\u2019s in that sack?\u201dPutting those two sentences together, it was extremely terrifying.Everyone\u2019s eyes moved out the window.The snowstorm outside still had not stopped. Before the exam, Old Yu went out to investigate and said that everything was covered in snow. There weren\u2019t any people or houses within a hundred miles from here\u2026\u2026..Where did the prey come from?What\u2019s more, Hunter A said that the food was dug out.When they arrived here in the afternoon, there was a man who didn\u2019t listen to the radio and his body was soon buried under the snow\u2026\u2026.Everyone recalled that moment in unison. Deep fear formed on their faces.Yu Wen was even about to vomit.\u201cIf you want to vomit, turn around.\u201d You Huo\u2019s cold voice rang out, \u201cDon\u2019t get it on me again.\u201d\u201cBrother you\u2019re awake?!\u201d Yu Wen cried out in pleasant surprise.\u201cWhat are you shouting for! Can\u2019t you be a little quieter?!\u201d The tattooed man shouted.You Huo glanced at the tattooed man and said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t sleeping.\u201dYu Wen: \u201cOh\u2014\u2014\u2014 Then why do you always close your eyes?\u201d\u201cEyes are uncomfortable.\u201dYu Wen remembered now that his father seemed to have mentioned that You Huo has had surgery done on his eyes and that would be tired and uncomfortable after looking at bright things for a long time. However, because he had never heard You Huo mention it, he didn\u2019t remember it himself.\u201cBrother, did you hear everything Hunter A said?\u201d Yu Wen asked.You Huo hummed in acknowledgment.Yu Wen: \u201cWhat do we do?\u201dYou Huo said lazily: \u201cI\u2019m a little hungry. Wait for dinner.\u201dYu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dWho are you trying to scare?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7: Third ViolationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMaster You\u2019s words effectively alarmed the crowd.Silence was instantly restored in the cabin, and everyone felt panicked.The soundproofing in the kitchen wasn\u2019t very good and the sound of something being dragged was heard.Soon after, there was a heavy sound. It sounded like\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Something large and frozen thrown onto the counter.After a while, the sound of bones being cut was heard.The sounds followed one after another.\u00b7The clockhand above the cabinet moved slowly. Every second felt excruciatingly long.After about an entire century, the door to the kitchen finally opened.The smell that wafted out had become even more strange.It was like the smell from earlier but now there was also an additional trace of blood and fishiness.Hunter A took out a dark cloth and used it to wipe his hands.He stuck his head out and smiled at everyone: \u201cIt\u2019s almost done. You know what? Meat that has been frozen before tastes very good. With a little bit of ice, it\u2019s both chewy and crunchy\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs the pale faced man described it, he appeared to be happily visualising it in his mind. He then said: \u201cYou\u2019ll love it.\u201dYu Wen huddled amongst the ground. With his brother awake, he now had the courage to curse out: \u201cFuck\u2026\u2026..what a psychopath.\u201dWhen he finished saying that, he heard his brothers stomach make a sound.Yu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHunter A suddenly smiled and said: \u201cAha! I heard it! I\u2019m happy there\u2019s another person looking forward to my delicious meal. Come, there\u2019s plenty available. I need a kind guest to help me out.\u201dHis pair of oversized eyes moved around in a circle.Almost everyone shrank back, only You Huo didn\u2019t move.He not only didn\u2019t shrink back, he even seemed to want to step forward.Yu Wen looked at him horrified whilst holding him back.\u201cNo, no, no. I know you must be feeling shy. No need to be polite.\u201d Hunter A said: \u201cI\u2019ll do it myself. Food is hard to come by so I\u2019ll pick a careful and steady person. It would be a pity if the plates broke.\u201dHe swayed his large body and walked into the living room. Because of his abnormal proportions, he walked a little clumsily.\u00b7No one dared to breath. Their eyes all looked over to a particular corner of the room.In the corner, the crazy bald man hid in the shadows. He didn\u2019t even seem to have noticed that there was now another person in the cabin and just continued to mutter nonsensically while rocking around.The only thing to feel fortunate about was that Hunter A\u2019s attention was on the side with more people and he didn\u2019t seem to have noticed the person who was alone in the corner.So, when Hunter A walked over to the bald man\u2019s side, some people quietly gasped.\u201cHuh?\u201dHunter A suddenly stopped and turned his head.\u201cFuck.\u201dYu Wen quietly swore.Hunter A\u2019s head turn was extremely terrifying. The angle that he achieved as not something a normal person could do. It was like an owl and his face was on his shoulders.With him turning back, he looked at the bald ban next to his feet.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026There\u2019s another guest here. How did I miss that? Let me see.\u201d Hunter A said.His legs were too thick so he squatted with difficulty.The bald man\u2019s eyes were blank. He didn\u2019t even see the large pale face before him.Hunter A was unhappy about being ignored. He pinched the bald man\u2019s chin and patted his face: \u201cHello? Dear guest?\u201dHe patted him twice but was unsuccessful.Hunter A gave him a hard slap.Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe bald man returned to his senses. His eyes regained focus. With wide yellow eyes, he looked silently at Hunter A in front of him.Two seconds later, the Hunter A\u2019s shoe was soaked in urine.Hunter A: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe big pale face twitched and he once again to form a large smile: \u201cI think this guest suits my requirements. Here, help me with the plates okay?\u201dThe bald man\u2019s limbs were soft. He couldn\u2019t move at all.\u201cGet up!\u201d Hunter A stood up and picked the bald man up.The bald man trembled like crazy.\u201cStand straight!\u201dThe bald man was terrified. He stood there trembling.Hunter A again smiled \u201cSee? That\u2019s a good guest. Come with me.\u201dThe bald man looked back at the others but before he could get a response. Hunter A said: \u201cI hope that the others will stay where you are. If anyone moves, I\u2019ll be unhappy and that guest will be in danger.\u201dThe person who originally wanted to make some hand gestures silently retracted his hands. The bald man no longer dared to turn back. He fearfully followed behind Hunter A.\u00b7Hunter A prepared the food very crudely and the kitchen was covered in small pieces of meat.On the counter was 12 empty porcelain plates and the cut-up meat formed a small hill in a glass bowl.The frozen meat was very hard, and you couldn\u2019t tell what the source of the meat was. The rest of it was thrown back into the sack which was tightly tied up again.The bald man trembled like a leaf. His yellow eyes were fixated at the butcher\u2019s knife on the table.\u201cWhat are you looking dear guest?\u201d Hunter A suddenly asked gently.The bald man\u2019s legs went weak and he quickly looked away.\u201cOh, here you go.\u201d Hunter A placed two plates in his hands and said: \u201cThe plates may be a bit heavy. With your legs shaking so much, please be careful. If you accidentally break them\u2026\u2026.Then we might have enough food for all of us.\u201dThe bald man was terrified.When he came out of the kitchen, Hunter A again emphasised to everyone: \u201cRemember? When you\u2019re helping me, you need to be very careful. If anyone in this room breaks any of the tableware, you will be severely punished. Hmm\u2026\u2026..you probably don\u2019t want to go hungry and become someone else\u2019s food right?\u201dPlease support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogEveryone heard this sentence and looked at the answer wall in sync.On it was a sentence \u2014\u2014- Cannot damage the tableware.They originally thought that the maximum number of casualties for this question would be one and they didn\u2019t expect this kind of trap.\u00b7The bald man and Hunter A placed 13 plates out and arranged it in a circle along the long table. He then placed the glass bowl of meat in the middle.When the last plate was placed down, the bald man let out a sigh of relief and slumped down onto a chair.\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201dSomeone called out.The bald man was stunned. He looked at the crowd.He saw Old Yu using his eyes to direct him in the direction of the answer wall.The bald man hurriedly looked over.\u00b7When the question was updated, the bald man had just returned from the confinement room and had been acting mad in the corner so he wasn\u2019t aware of the changes.He saw the phrases \u201cOnly 12 can be accommodated\u201d and \u201cOne is destined to die\u201d and his face instantly turned pale.Who knew whether or not the place he sat at was the one that was the unfortunate seat?The bald man struggled to get up but a big pair of hands held him down.Hunter A moved over to his ears and said: \u201cYou have already chosen a seat. You can\u2019t change it. It\u2019s no point standing up again. Forget it.\u201dThe words \u201cforget it\u201d stunned the bald man on the spot.He slumped back in the chair and no longer moved.\u00b7Hunter A felt a little regretful. He sighed: \u201cHaa\u2026\u2026..How could he faint like that? I\u2019ve only just served up the meat and there\u2019s also wine.\u201dFood had not yet been eaten and one had already fallen.Hunter A\u2019s eyes scanned across the others.\u201cI still need another person to help me get the glasses.\u201d He walked awkwardly to them while muttering: \u201cWho should it be? I like children, let\u2019s go with a child\u2026\u2026\u201dAs he said that, his eyes rolled around in a circle and fell onto Yu Wen.Yu Wen seemingly forgot to breathe.Hunter A smiled and raised his hand.\u201cThen it\u2019ll be you my\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201cHis voice just fell when You Huo wordlessly moved in front of Yu Wen.\u201c\u2014\u2014-child.\u201dThe finger that the Hunter A had stretched out pointed straight at him.Hunter A\u2019s pale face stiffened.You Huo looked at him calmly. \u201cMe? Okay.\u201dHunter A: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dOkay your head.He appeared to be a little angry.You Huo then said: \u201cGoing back on your words?\u201dHunter A retracted his finger and smiled while the edges of his lips twitched: \u201cNo, no. How can I do that? As the owner, of course I should be true to my words.\u201dHe felt miffed for a moment before waving his hand: \u201cCome on kind-hearted guest.\u201dHe said \u201cCome on\u201d.But it sounded like \u201cWhy don\u2019t you die\u201d.Hunter A turned around and walked into the kitchen.You Huo didn\u2019t lift his eyes and followed behind.Yu Wen was shocked. He hurriedly grabbed him and whispered: \u201cBrother! What are you doing!?\u201dYou Huo glanced at him: \u201cGetting wine.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear him?! If you accidentally break the glasses, you\u2019ll die!\u201d Yu Wen was anxious.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..Am I physically incapacitated? To even break glasses just by carrying them?\u201dYu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThat\u2019s true but\u2026\u2026He still felt that his brother was going to do something.\u201cYou tell me first. Why did you suddenly take the initiative to get the glasses?\u201d Yu Wen didn\u2019t relent.You Huo pointed at the answer wall with his chin. He then pried his sleeves out of Yu Wen\u2019s hands and said: \u201cSee the requirements for the answer?\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019m not blind.\u201dYou Huo calmly said: \u201cThen let me teach you something.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe more emphasis there is, the more suspicious.\u201dYou Huo then walked off.Yu Wen stood in place stunned. He quickly looked at his dad: \u201cWhat does my brother mean??? Why am I so confused?!\u201dOld Yu was even more confused.\u00b7You Huo came to the kitchen.Hunter A was looking for the key for the cabinet.There was a total of seven keys hanging from the brass ring. He selected three of them and opened the doors on the right-hand side of the red cabinet. He slowly pulled out 13 wine glasses and arranged it in a row on the counter.You Huo picked one up at random and examined it.At first glance it was just an ordinary wine glass. Nothing abnormal was noted.Hunter A frowned: \u201cPut it down! Did I say that you can touch it?! Why don\u2019t you know about basic guest etiquette?\u201dYou Huo snorted and placed the glass back.He passed the door and looked a at the clock. He urged with a cold voice: \u201cWith your speed, do you have enough time in a day to have two meals?\u201dHunter A: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe glared at You Huo and quietly cursed at him. He then barely squeezed out a smile: \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay. A generous owner should always be tolerant of the guest. I understand you\u2019re probably too hungry.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogYou Huo coldly scoffed.Hunter A: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThis was his first time encountering such a guest. He no longer wanted to talk and he turned to prepare his wine.Taking advantage of when Hunter A is busy, You Huo held open the cabinet door and scanned inside at its contents.Apart from the already arranged porcelain plates and the wine glasses that they had taken out, there was only a silver saucer and a small bundle of cutlery.\u201cOkay!\u201d Hunter A suddenly spoke up. \u201cIt\u2019s not polite to peek.\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t respond.Hunter A again said: \u201cHelp me take out the cutlery too. Thanks.\u201dYou Huo glanced at his expression and pulled them out from the cabinet.\u00b7Hunter A carefully hung the keys back to his waist. He then pulled out a round try and placed the glasses one by one onto the tray.You Huo suddenly said: \u201cI noticed something.\u201dHunter A\u2019s\u2019s movements stopped. His big pale face looked warily at him: \u201cWhat?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cYou seem to be particularly careful with the wine glasses.\u201dHunter A: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe was silent for a moment. He then explained: \u201cYou saw wrong. Dining is a very sacred activity. I am very cautious about every tableware.\u201dYou Huo hummed in response.Hunter A looked at him with vigilance.You Huo: \u201cI was just joking earlier.\u201dHunter A: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u00b7In the living room, Yu Wen was still worried about his brother. He was afraid that this fearless brother of his would completely ruin the kitchen utensils.In the end, he heard Hunter A\u2019s angry shout: \u201cScram!\u201dYou Huo walked out expressionlessly with both hands empty.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dEveryone was stunned.\u201cWhere are the glasses?\u201d Yu Wen gestured. \u201cWeren\u2019t you getting the glasses? Why did you get kicked out?\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t return back to the crowd and just stood near the dining table with his hands in his pockets: \u201cHe changed his mind and decided to bring it himself.\u201dEveryone was alarmed. They felt that it wasn\u2019t good angering Hunter A.That guy is the subject of the question!Who knows what he can do? What if he opens his mouth and says that you\u2019re going to die?Just when everyone looked at each other in fear, Hunter A walked out himself with the large tray.On the tray was a large number of wine glasses and cutlery.Hunter A ushered You Huo aside and personally placed them down on by one.For some reason, You Huo continued to stand on the side looking as if it was very interesting seeing Hunter A put down tableware.\u00b7Yu Wen was anxious to death. He mouthed and gestured exaggeratedly to You Huo: \u201cBrother! Brother come over here! What are you doing standing there?!\u201dYou Huo however acted like he didn\u2019t see him and continued to lazily watch Hunter A.\u201cMove aside!\u201d Hunter A rudely yelled at You Huo.After yelling, he turned around and smiled at the others: \u201cWhat are you standing around for? Come and sit. We\u2019re about to start.\u201dAs he said that, he appeared to be a little hungry. He stopped and reached over to pick up an piece of raw meat from the glass bowl.Everyone watched his mouth opened like a black hole before swallowing the entire piece of meat. He even swallowed it together with the bones. It was just like what he described before, it was both chewy and crunchy.The two old ladies collapsed onto the floor.The panic in the room grew heavier.\u00b7Hunter A finished eating and licked his lips. He said softly: \u201cAh, that was rude of me.\u201dHe pointed at You Huo and blamed him: \u201cIt\u2019s all because of this offending guest who made me a little angry. I have a problem where I get hungry when I\u2019m angry.\u201dHis eyes moved around, and he counted the pieces of meat in the bowl. \u201cOh no, I accidentally ate one and now there\u2019s only 11 left.\u201dEveryone on the side watched him unblinkingly.Hunter A picked up the last wine glass and smiled: \u201cThen I will probably have to bother you\u2026\u2026..and one more can die?\u201dAll the blood disappeared from their faces.In the dead silence, a cold voice suddenly sounded: \u201cIsn\u2019t this against the rule?\u201dThe person who spoke was none other than You Huo.Hunter A was stunned. He wanted to turn to look at him but because of his uncoordinated body, he turned around in a strange posture.\u201cIt\u2019s you again!\u201dHunter A frowned and was about to get angry.You Huo suddenly lifted his foot and kicked him.In an instant, the world spun.Then a loud crash was heard and his large pale face had fallen to the ground. Along with Hunter A, the wine glass that he had in his hand also fell.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHunter A watched the glass shatter before him for two whole seconds. His eyes then widened in horror.\u00b7No one in the room dared to move.Everyone maintained their stiff posture and stood there stunned.Very quickly, the hair-rising rooster started to call out!The answer wall which hadn\u2019t changed for the past four hours now had another line appear.Violation warning: Violation of exam requirements. The invigilators have been notified.Invigilator: 001, 154, 922.Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dYu Wen glanced at the answer wall dumbfounded. He suddenly felt a little bad for the invigilators.\u00b7In the small western building in the woods, 922 grabbed a notice and ran into the office.\u201cBoss\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Jiu frowned, and his first reaction was to look at the clock.\u201cDon\u2019t look at it. It has only been an hour since we sent him back\u201d 154 said with a wooden face.Qin Jiu snorted and didn\u2019t know whether he should be happy or angry: \u201cWhat is it this time? Did he fight to answer the question?\u201d154 shook his head: \u201cNo, it\u2019s a little more serious than that. He killed the subject.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cHe killed what?\u201d154 replied expressionlessly: \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear wrong. The subject of the question itself is dead.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d922 who managed to catch up was shocked: \u201cA subject can fucking die? What is going on?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A chill rushed through the cabin as soon as the door opened.Familiar scenery. Familiar people.The faces of the old, weak and sick people in the room had all stiffened.154\u2019s face was even more stiff: \u201cWe\u2019ve received another violation notice.\u201dHe pulled out a note and said: \u201cThe notice said that an examinee\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cA cute and obedient examinee who will never learn to behave.\u201d Qin Jiu added teasingly while taking off his gloves.154 looked at him incredulously.\u201cGot a problem?\u201d Qin Jiu raised his eyebrow.154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..No.\u201dHe was wondering how blind he must be to see \u201ccute and obedient\u201d on You Huo.But the one who spoke was his boss. Only he had the authority to bullshit.You Huo stood against the wall with his arms folded as he looked coldly at Qin Jiu.Qin Jiu looked at him with a hint of a smile at his lips. With the warm glow from the fire stove between them, he nodded back in greeting.That act was very gentlemanly yet his expression was filled with jest.154 was afraid that a certain invigilator and a certain examinee would start a bloody battle right then and there, so he quickly said with a stern expression: \u201c\u2014\u2014\u2014-A certain examinee violated the examination rules causing the questions main subject\u2014\u2014-\u201d922: \u201cThat is, the hunter.\u201d154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.to die on the spot. Situations like this are rather rare\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201d922: \u201cUnheard of.\u201d154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026We need to do a thorough investigation. I hope all of you can give us an explanation.\u201d922: \u201cThis mainly refers to a certain examinee.\u201d154 closed his eyes.His boss was constantly instigating hatred while his colleague had something wrong with his brain.He calmed himself down and then expressionlessly stored away the note. He said to everyone: \u201cWhere is Hunter A?\u201dThe examinees in the room parted like the sea to reveal the long dining table and the large pile of cloth lying next to it.The invigilator moved closer to examine it only to see that it wasn\u2019t cloth but a long, black coat. The coat was old and frayed and the edges of it was trimmed with black bear fur. It exuded a foul odour.Hunter A who had fallen was facing down and was covered by the coat.Using the professional ethics of an invigilator, 922 turned the Hunter A\u2019s body over.Whilst Hunter A was still alive, his face was already very pale and after he had died, it had turned a little more gray. With his face turned to one side and his eyes widened, he still maintained a terrified expression. His mouth was like a cracked open hole and his lips were bright red.922 sternly took a step back and, whilst no one was watching, he rubbed his hand on 154\u2019s coat.154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe restrained the urge to roll his eyes and bent down to examine the body.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogHunter A\u2019s thick fingers were still holding the bottom of the wine glass. The rest of the glass had already shattered and were scattered across the ground.The notice of violation that they had received said that Hunter A had said: \u201cEveryone in the room who breaks any of the tableware will be severely punished.\u201dThis was the same as the requirements for the exam. It was originally set up for the examinees.But who would\u2019ve guessed that soon after he said that, he would shatter one himself and die faster than anyone else.Although they were generally aware of what may have happened, 154 continued to act professionally. He looked at You Huo and confirmed: \u201cYou kicked him?\u201dYou Huo lowered his eyes to look at him. He lazily spoke up: \u201cMy legs were numb so I staggered a bit.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dAs if you staggered.154: \u201cDon\u2019t you think that excuse is a little far-fetched?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cDid I set the rule that the tableware can\u2019t be broken?\u201d154: \u201cNo you didn\u2019t.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cDid you give birth to that uncoordinated body?\u201d154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe other party was both cold and ridiculing. Invigilator 154 felt that he could no longer go on and turned around wanting to find someone tougher to take over only to see that only 922 was next to him. Their boss didn\u2019t move to look at the body.Seeing the invigilator in daze, Yu Wen mustered up his courage and asked: \u201cUm\u2026\u2026The glass was broken by Hunter A himself. He died also because of his own actions. Can you not count this as my brother violating the rules?\u201d\u2018Beep, beep, beep\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2019154 had not yet spoken up when three rule violating reminders were heard.At the same time, the three invigilators had received a warning. This was the first time for that to happen.The people in the cabin had not heard this noise before and didn\u2019t know what was going on.Yu Wen looked around for the source and asked vigilantly: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d922 reassured him: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s just the examination system urging us to hurry up with the punishment.\u201dEveryone fell silent. They became even more nervous.Another person said: \u201cThen\u2026\u2026then can I be punished instead?\u201dEveryone turned to look. The one who spoke was Yu Yao.She raised her thin pale hands like a student trying to get the teacher\u2019s attention. If you looked closely enough, you could see that her hand was slightly trembling, but her eyes were determined.Unfortunately, she was completely ignored by the invigilators.\u00b7The system again urged them two more times.The two invigilators walked through the crowd over to You Huo.The others wanted to follow but they were hesitant and didn\u2019t dare.This was particularly the case when 154 stopped halfway and glanced back at them. Those who had wanted to move stopped in place.Facing You Huo, 922\u2019s words were not so serious. He took the opportunity when the other examinees can\u2019t hear him to ramble: \u201cIt\u2019s not because we want you to come. I\u2019m telling you, when we got the notice 154 skipped a step, I dropped my meat and boss almost twisted off the bird\u2019s head when he was petting it. We all don\u2019t want to punish you. It\u2019s true. Who\u2019s really the one being tortured \u2014\u2014\u2013 Stop sneering. I can see that you have some special opinions about our boss.\u201dYou Huo\u2019s eyes swept passed Qin Jiu and then he slowly looked away. It was as if just looking at him made his eyes hurt.922 shook is head and said: \u201cYou\u2019re really brave.\u201dMaster You didn\u2019t move.922 then added: \u201cThey clearly wrote on the wall not to break any of the tableware. Yes, you certainly didn\u2019t directly smash the glass \u2013 If you did that, you would be the one lying on the floor \u2013 But if you said that you had nothing to do with the glass smashing and the subject dying\u2026\u2026\u2026If I was the system I would be angry to death.\u201d\u201cIndirect cause is also a cause.\u201d 922 rubbed his neck.When the system issued a warning earlier, his small red light was hidden at back of his neck.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blog922 stopped. He said to You Huo: \u201cThis was the final decision made by the system after fairly assessing the situation.\u201d\u00b7You Huo got up.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d 154 asked vigilantly.You Huo was about 185cm tall so he was a little taller than 154, and about the same as 922, but when he stood up and looked over, it always gave others a condescending feeling. This was no exception for 922.You Huo lightly glanced at them: \u201cDo I have the right to refuse punishment?\u201d922: \u201cThen why are you standing there with your arms crossed?\u201dYou Huo moved his lips: \u201cOut of politeness. Letting you finish speaking.\u201dThe two invigilators: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dIf they had a gun they would have already fired it.\u00b7You Huo walked away.When passing through the crowd, Old Yu grabbed him: \u201cYou\u2019re really going?\u201dYou Huo subconsciously frowned.He had always hated skin contact particularly the ones that come without warning, but Old Yu was sincerely worried about him. He restrained himself for a moment before pulling away: \u201cAnother time is not going to hurt me.\u201dIt was already his third time getting punished. How bad could it be? He thought.In just that small building, he had already been confined and he was made to clean. He had seen plenty of bones and flesh residue because of that so what else could they do to him?What\u2019s more, no matter how annoying the punishment was\u2026\u2026.Even if it involved making him stare at that No. 001, it was only for three hours.He used his last bit of patience to wave at Old Yu and he walked towards the door without looking back: \u201cThat short punishment time will be over after a nap.\u201dThe moment his voice fell, a familiar low voice sounded.\u201cThis badly behaving Mr Humph\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201dYou Huo\u2019s steps stopped at the door. Holding onto the door handle, he looked to the left expressionlessly.Qin Jiu stood against the sofa playing with a leather whip\u2026\u2026\u2026..Oh sorry, a long leather rope.He dragged out his words as he asked him: \u201cYou seem to be in a hurry. Where are you going?\u201dThey looked at each other with challenging eyes for a moment before You Huo spoke up: \u201cGetting reincarnated. Should I wait for you?\u201dQin Jiu softly laughed and said in a low voice: \u201cI\u2019m flattered but you don\u2019t need to run that far.\u201dYou Huo raised his eyebrow: \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cOh right.\u201d Qin Jiu turned to look inside the room, \u201cWhere\u2019s the other invigilator? Did you forget to tell him what his punishment is this time?\u201dYou Huo looked suspiciously at 154.The other party pulled out a sheet of paper and read: \u201cAccording to the regulations, if an examinee violates the rules three times, they will be treated as a special case. The invigilators will be present on-site the whole time for full-time surveillance.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dFor some reason, the invigilators\u2019 tone sounded very reluctant.154 looked at You Huo and then continued to read: \u201cAlso, the examinee is deprived of his right to choose.\u201dThe room was silent.After a moment You Huo looked at Qin Jiu and said coldly: \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201dQin Jiu used his hand to gesture \u201cgo ahead\u201d and spoke gentlemanly: \u201cNot kidding. There\u2019s still a while until the end\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dHe pulled out a phone from his coat pocket and pretended to look at it: \u201c\u2014\u2014\u2014-36 hours and 24 minutes. This means that we will have to stay together in the same room for a day and a half. We even brought our luggage. It\u2019s right by the door. You can take a look if you want?\u201dYou Huo opened the door and looked out.By the door, two suitcases stood neatly together.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d36 hours and 24 minutes\u2026\u2026..This wasn\u2019t a matter of a nap\u2026\u2026\u2026..It\u2019s practically a fucking long sleep.And who are you trying to disgust by bringing your suitcase???Oh right, I also want to remind you.\u201d Qin Jiu\u2019s low voice once again sounded, \u201cThere are still 24 minutes until the next answer submission. It\u2019s soon going to be 23 minutes. According to the rules, violators do not have the right to answer during this time. In order to prevent a particular misbehaving man from violating the rules again, I have no choice but to do something a little rude\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAs Qin Jiu said this, the leather rope in his hand had already formed a circle. It wrapped around You Huo\u2019s left hand.He grabbed You Huo\u2019s shoulder, turned him around, and put his right hand in as well. He then pulled at it tightly.Whoosh\u2014\u2014-The rope instantly formed a knot that tightly fastened You Huo\u2019s hands together.Qin Jiu stood behind him whilst holding his shoulder. He lowered his head: \u201cThis is the return gift for that dirty bucket. Do you like it?\u201dMaster You liked it so much he was about to explode.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9: Celebratory BeheadingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe attic wasn\u2019t high. With one wooden column standing vertically in the centre, it supported the roof like an umbrella.There was a bed crammed into this small space. The sheets that had probably not been used for the past hundreds of years were both mouldy and smelly.Qin Jiu used his glove to cover his nose as he assessed the room.\u201cLet me think. Where should I put you?\u201d He gently said.He was a little taller that You Huo and would hit the roof if he stood up straight. He could only bow his head as he stood there.\u201cOn the bed? The bed has a bed post I can tie the rope to. Its width definitely is enough but it\u2019s a little too short.\u201dQin Jiu shook the bed frame to test out its sturdiness. When he turned around he saw the \u201clet\u2019s die together\u201d expression on You Huo\u2019s face.If Yu Wen or Old Yu saw You Huo\u2019s expression, they would have immediately ran off but Qin Jiu just laughed.His muffled laughter rose from his throat and he said: \u201cOkay fine. It indeed isn\u2019t very clean, the frames also look a little thin so it probably won\u2019t last\u2026\u2026.This place also isn\u2019t big. What do you want to do?\u201dYou Huo maintained a cold expression and don\u2019t plan to pay him any attention.Qin Jiu also wasn\u2019t in a hurry. He just continued to wait.You Huo was watched for a while before he finally said impatiently: \u201cI hope that you can lie on that lovely smelling bed, put a rope around your throat and give me the other end so that the moment I move it, everything will turn completely quiet. Can you do that?\u201dQin Jiu narrowed his eyes.For a moment You Huo thought he was unhappy. He didn\u2019t expect to see him laugh and say: \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t have that kind of interest.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dCrazy bastard.\u00b7The crazy bastard at least still had some human decency and he didn\u2019t really put You Huo onto the Hunter A\u2019s bed.You Huo sat on the floor with his hands behind his back. He was tied to the pillar that supported the roof.Qin Jiu walked around him to open the window.The window in the attic was very small. It was no bigger than his palm but the cold air that came in managed to diffuse out the sour smell in the attic.Qin Jiu: \u201cCold?\u201dThose words were just complete bullshit. Wearing a T-shirt on a snowy day like this, would he not be cold?But compared to being cold, You Huo couldn\u2019t stand the smell more.He ignored Qin Jiu\u2019s question and frowned: \u201cCan you let me stand?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dYou Huo glared at him coldlyQin Jiu returned back to the bedside and sat at a small round wooden table. Facing You Huo, he said: \u201cYour legs are too long so you might accidentally kick me. Sitting is more stable.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dStable your mum.After two consecutive bouts of irritation, You Huo turned to the right and no longer paid him any attention.On the right, the place that was supposed to be a wall was covered with a piece of glass. Through You Huo\u2019s angle, he could see half the living room downstairs. The examinees were currently standing around or sitting in daze.Without You Huo, the old, weak, sickly and pregnant were like headless flies. They spun around aimlessly and had no sense of direction.\u00b7Yu Wen grabbed the knife and desperately started to engrave words onto the wall.He intended to write down all the physic formulas that he knew even if it had nothing to do with optics. After racking his brains out, he realised that everything that he knew was written in less than five minutes.It was only when the time to apply knowledge comes that you regret not acquiring enough of it.In Yu Wen\u2019s eighteen years of life, this was the first time he felt pain when he thought of this sentence.\u201cWhat else? Does anyone remember anything else?\u201d He turned to look for help from the others.Yu Yao revealed a despondent look: \u201cI did physics and chemistry in high school but I changed to literary studies in University. After working for so long\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Those things on the wall, I wouldn\u2019t have remembered it if you didn\u2019t write it.\u201dPlease support the translator and read this fromhttps://kktranslates(.)home(.)blog/Yu Wen looked at her like a small puppy: \u201cBig sister, please think a little harder. Whatever you think off, just add it!\u201dHe fortunately took after his mother. Although he cannot be compared to You Huo, he could still be considered rather good looking at school.Yu Yao\u2019s maternal love instincts grew. She hesitated and said: \u201cI still remember the refraction schematic diagram. The very, very, very basic type. Don\u2019t laugh when I draw it.\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t laugh! If anyone laughs, I\u2019ll cut them. Really.\u201dAfter nonsensically promising her, Yu Yao held her stomach and moved over. Using the knife, she drew an arc and two refracted lights.Yu Wen made an \u201coh\u201d noise and internally thought that it really was very simple but he himself had forgotten about it.\u201cAnyone else?\u201dYu Wen was like a passionate salesman. His eyes swept past the rest of the people.The two old ladies\u2026\u2026..Forget it. They probably don\u2019t know anything about physics.The thug and sickly man had already lowered their heads in shame.The bald man was dazed. It was good enough that he wasn\u2019t crazy.And there was also an old man with twin grandchildren. The old man appeared to be suffering from slight dementia and his grandchildren were only in elementary school\u2026\u2026\u2026To use physics to abuse children, it was something Yu Wen couldn\u2019t do.The foreigner Mike could say two words \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cNeo\u201d and \u201cneosomo\u201d. It was completely useless.As for Old Yu\u2026\u2026.he only knows about alcohol.Yu Wen finally experienced the despair his brother felt.\u00b7922 moved his luggage in and saw him standing in daze in front of the fire stove. He said: \u201cI suggest that you stay away from the fire. Don\u2019t burn to death before you can even answer the question.\u201dYu Wen fiddled with the broken jars and thought: Forget it. Might as well burn to crisp.He looked up at the attic.The glass had become worn with time and it was very blurry. The lights in the attic was also dark. He wondered what that 001 invigilator was doing to his brother. Would his brother be looking over here and be disappointed when he sees them acting so hopelessly\u2026\u2026\u2026?\u201cThere are still 5 minutes.\u201d 922 reminded him.Everyone panicked.\u00b7The places where someone could stay in this old cabin was limited and the places where people could sit was also limited.There were tableware placed on the dining table but one represented death so they couldn\u2019t randomly sit in a chair.922 took the suitcase and circled around before squeezing together with 154 on the sofa.152 complained: \u201cIsn\u2019t boss in the attic?\u201d922: \u201cI know.\u201d154: \u201cThen why are you putting the suitcase here? Waiting for him to get it himself?\u201d922: \u201cThe two bad guys are up there. I don\u2019t want to go up yet.\u201d154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dUseless922 pouted: \u201cWhy are you rolling your eyes at me? Why don\u2019t you go up?\u201d154 sat while watching the examinees sternly: \u201cI\u2019m invigilating.\u201d\u201cDid they ask you to watch over them? The one who needs to be supervised is upstairs.\u201d\u201cBoss alone is enough.\u201d922: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe two invigilators had nothing to say.In the end, it was 922 who sighed: \u201cI have been an invigilator for three years\u2026\u2026.No, not just invigilating. Even if I include the time when I was an examinee, I have never seen someone so lawless.\u201dHe thought that 154 would nod in agreement but the other person thought for a while and said: \u201cYou\u2019ve seen one.\u201d922 was surprised: \u201cAh??? Who? When?\u201d154 lifted his chin towards the attic.922 then reacted\u2026\u2026.That\u2019s right. How could he forget! There was another difficult to deal with examinee, and he later became invigilator 001.How difficult must Qin Jiu have been back then? Legend says that he almost broke the examination system.\u201cSpeaking of which, I\u2019ve always wanted to ask boss about his previous feats when I manage to muster up enough courage.\u201d 922 said, \u201cAfter all, I have only seen it twice.\u201d154 quickly stopped him: \u201cAre you joking? Don\u2019t mess with things!\u201d922 was puzzled: \u201cWhy? I can\u2019t even ask? I\u2019ve noticed that every time I mentioned the boss, you would interrupt me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just afraid that you would die too fast.\u201d 154 deadpanned: \u201cBoss doesn\u2019t remember much about the past. It was said that the examination system encountered some problems and accidentally injured him causing him to forget some things.\u201d922 was stunned: \u201cThere was something like that? Why didn\u2019t I know?\u201d154 was expressionless: \u201cBecause you only know to eat.\u201d922 sat there stunned154 added: \u201cHaven\u2019t you noticed that he doesn\u2019t mention the past at all? When I first became an invigilator, I almost met my death when I asked about it\u2026\u2026..Anyway, I don\u2019t want to go through it again. You also wouldn\u2019t want to so watch yourself.\u201d\u00b7In the attic, the only light there wasn\u2019t turned on.The space wasn\u2019t big and the light that projected over from downstairs allowed them to vaguely make out the shapes of things.The snow outside was still heavy, and it splattered against the building as it blew past.You Huo continued to look downstairs. He looked like he was silent from helplessness, but he also didn\u2019t appear anxious. A faint layer of clear light reflected his eyes and his earring would occasionally glimmer at certain angles.Qin Jiu watched him for a while and then suddenly spoke up. He asked lazily: \u201cHave I met you before?\u201dAfter a moment, You Huo turned to look at him. His light brown eyes were cold like winter nights.\u201cNo, if we have met I\u2019m afraid only one of us would have lived.\u201dYou Huo\u2019s silky voice carried a hint of mocking.\u201cReally?\u201d Qin Jiu supported his chin and appeared to be thinking about something. He then agreed: \u201cIt\u2019s a little regrettable but that does seem to be the case.\u201dPlease support the translator and read this fromhttps://kktranslates(.)home(.)blog/As they spoke there were some creaking sounds coming from the wooden ladder.154\u2019s voice travelled over: \u201cBoss, time is almost up.\u201d922\u2019s low voice also could be head. He seemed to be behind 154: \u201cIs it okay up there? Why do I feel so scared?\u201d154 whispered: \u201cYou shut up.\u201d\u201cBoss.\u201d 154 poked his head out, \u201cAre you coming down? It\u2019s time for the answer collection.\u201dQin Jiu asked: \u201cHow did they answer? I saw that little brat writing a novel nonstop.\u201d922 had not yet arrived but his voice arrived first: \u201cIt\u2019s useless. I didn\u2019t look at it carefully, but I could tell at glance. If an answer like that can score points, I\u2019ll behead myself in celebration.\u201d154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u00b7There was an old-fashioned clock above the cabinet. Every time the minute hand moved, it would make a small sound. Usually, no one would notice it but at this moment it sounded very loud and heart-stopping.It ticked a few times and then the rooster called out.The three invigilators came downstairs as the terrible sound made the examinees tremble. In order to prevent another rule violation, they waited until the ninth cry before untying You Huo.Everyone was like newly hatched chicks in a cage. They picked a corner furthest away from the door and huddled together. It was as if they wouldn\u2019t be pulled out of the examination centre if they did this.Almost all of them had their eyes closed as they waited for the upcoming trial.They waited and an entire minute passed.922: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Did the system freeze because there were too many words?\u201dThe moment the invigilator said that, the answer wall underwent some changes. On the long and eloquent answer, two red circles appeared.Yu Wen looked through the gap between his fingersOne of them circled something he wrote: Refractive index.And the other one circled the last-minute diagram Yu Yao drew: An extremely simple refraction schematic diagram.Next to the two red circles, two red numbers appeared.12The people saw the numbers and didn\u2019t react.The answer wall then changed again and all the useless answers that didn\u2019t earn any points disappeared. Several red sentences appeared:Bonus points: 1 of 13 people died, achieved the question requirements. 6.Additional points: All examinees survived, 2.Total points for this part: 11 points.The cabin was quiet for a moment and then it was followed by Yu Wen\u2019s shout: \u201cFuck!!! 11 points! I thought we were a goner but we got 11 points instead!\u201d\u201cBrother!!! Did you see that?! I got a point!!!\u201dAmongst the deafening voices of the examinees, 922 looked at 154 with surprise: \u201cThe system must be crazy! They killed the subject and they still fucking get additional points?!\u201d154 who saw this was also dumbfounded. He turned to look at You Huo.This great master who had been tied up for the past 20 minutes had managed to earn 8 points using just his foot.You Huo coldly appreciated his expression and then stretched out his good-looking hand: \u201cGive me your head to celebrate.\u201d922: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe system probably felt that it had gone crazy after reporting the total points.After a while, it once again spat out a line of words:Legibility -2The total jumped from 11 points to 9 points.Yu Wen the eager student who wrote an entire book got one point and then was deducted two points. In total it was -1.Congratulations.In the small cabin, whilst both the examinees and the invigilators were going crazy, the contents of the answer wall changed:Question: There are only 12 guests and 12 sets of tableware in the Hunter A\u2019s cabin which is enough for each of you. However, there still remains a secret hidden amongst the tableware and is hidden under the light. The person sitting at the selected one will be cursed. Will that person be you?Requirement: Find that special set of tableware (But cannot damage them).Knowledge being tested: Optics.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: Wine GlassPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhile everyone was still in shock after seeing the question being refreshed, a sudden sound appeared in the cabin\u2026\u2026..It sounded like sharp nails scratching across a wooden board.\u201cWh-who?\u201dEveryone\u2019s hair rose. They looked around searching for the source of the sound.In this terrifying setting, no one dared to fall away from the group, so they only looked around while remaining in place.Soon, someone cried out desperately: \u201cBehind! It\u2019s behind me! Help\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe one who cried out was the bald man.He was the only one who didn\u2019t move over to the answering wall to join the others.For the entire time, he sat alone at the dining table. As if paralysed from his neck down, he remained huddled in the seat that he had selected.The bald man had fainted earlier with fear because of Hunter A but now he was scared awake by the scratching sounds.With his face coated with snot and tears, he cried out with panic: \u201cBehind me. Help me! Save me, please!\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s no one behind you\u2026\u201d Yu Yao said in a quiet voice.\u201cYeah, there\u2019s no one\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen the bald man heard this, he cried even more fiercely.No one dared to approach him. They could only desperately gesture at the bald man: \u201cDon\u2019t just sit there! Hurry up and come over. Come here!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t move! This chair\u2026\u2026..I can\u2019t move. It has trapped me!\u201d The bald man was so panicked, his words were almost incoherent.\u201cYou mean, you can\u2019t get off after sitting in the chair?\u201d\u201cYes. I can\u2019t\u2026\u2026It wants me dead. It wants me to die!\u201d The bald man cried.Everyone fearfully backed away from the dining table. Only You Huo walked over.\u201cBrother?\u201d Yu Wen called out.He was originally going to grab You Huo to stop him from taking risks but when he thought of his brother\u2019s performance and his own miserable -1 point, he decided to just follow You Huo.They walked behind the bald man and finally found the source of the sound\u2014\u2014\u2014On the back of the bald man\u2019s chair, sawdust scattered as the light-coloured core of the wood was exposed. It was as if there was an invisible hand scratching on the surface of the chair.Yu Wen: \u201cIt\u2019s writing something?!\u201dYou Huo hummed in agreement.This great master was more patient towards the \u201cghost\u201d than he was towards humans. He crossed his arms and waited on the side for it to finish.After the other examinees in the room hesitated for a moment, they quickly rushed over and huddled behind You Huo.\u201c12! It\u2019s writing 12!\u201d The tattooed man shouted out.Soon after that, the sound of nail scratching against wood was heard coming from a nearby chair.You Huo took a few steps to walk over and the large crowd behind him also shuffled with him. When he stopped his steps, the large crowd would also stop as if someone had suddenly stepped onto the brakes.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dYou Huo for a moment suspected that they were not taking a physics exam and was instead playing a game of Mother Hen.The scratching sound lasted for about five minutes and each seat at the table was numbered.From 1 to 12, they each corresponded to a seat. The role of these numbers was obvious.Once you have found the cursed tableware, you just needed to write the number on the answer wall.Yu Wen guessed: \u201cMy answer and sister Yu Yao\u2019s answer were circled, and we got points for that. They were all related to refraction so does that mean\u2026\u2026\u2026That if we wanted to find the cursed tableware, we need to use refraction?\u201d\u201cProbably.\u201d Everyone answered, \u201cBut what\u2019s refraction?\u201dYu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHis frozen look was too amusing. Yu Yao couldn\u2019t hold back and laughed.She had always been crying and grieving so this was her first time making an expression other than that. Even Yu Yao herself was a little surprised.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogShe was stunned in place for a moment. She then walked over to the group and patiently explained the concept of \u201crefraction\u201d.Yu Wen dethawed and looked up at You Huo next to him only to see that he was deep in thought.\u201cBrother\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Yu Wen quietly moved over to him.He followed You Huo\u2019s line of sight. Over in that direction was a group of elderly examinees. There was also a beaten sofa where the three invigilators sat.This mentally deficient boy asked: \u201cWhat are you looking at the invigilators for?\u201dYou Hu wordlessly took away his line of sight and looked down at him.Yu Wen retracted his neck and said timidly: \u201cForget it, forget it. Go ahead and look. I won\u2019t ask anymore.\u201d\u00b7Although they had managed to survive through a round of answer collection and managed to earn themselves another six hours, no one felt relieved.Everyone stared at the tableware on the dining table like it was some precious treasure.\u201cCan we touch this plate?\u201d The tattooed man muttered. \u201cIf I pick it up to take a look, will it be considered as me selecting my seat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better not to touch it . Death\u2014\u2014-\u201cBefore Old Yu could finish his words, Yu Hou picked up a wine glass.Old Yu: \u201c\u2014\u2014\u2014Is impossible!\u201dThe tattooed man rolled his eyes.Everyone stared at You Huo bewildered. Seeing that he was still alive and well, and wasn\u2019t forced into a seat, they felt relieved and they all started to pick up the tableware and examine them.\u201cWhy are you so brave?!\u201d Since he is afterall his nephew, Old Yu hurried over to ask You Huo, \u201cWhat if picking up a wine glass counts?!\u201dYou Huo picked up a second glass: \u201cIt won\u2019t. I picked them up in the kitchen.\u201dOld Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dAre you proud of that?Old Yu was almost about to vomit blood because of his nephew but he was also too afraid to scold him. He could only glare at You Hou from an unseen angle.\u201cDad, move aside.\u201dYu Wen walked past Old Yu and picked up a silver spoon. Unable to find anything, he switched over to a silver fork.At first glance, they were all common household items. The plates were white porcelain and they didn\u2019t have any patterns on it while the silver spoons and forks were designed very simply.Just when he was about to switch to a saucer, he finally noticed that his brother wasn\u2019t touching anything else.\u201cBrother, why are you only looking at the wine glasses?\u201d Yu Wen couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cNo point looking at the others.\u201d You Huo placed down the third glass and stopped examining them. He proceeded to move away from the dining table.\u201cNo point?\u201d Yu Wen was stunned.While he was stunned, the tattooed man who had already looked through them all complained: \u201cWhat is this garbage? There\u2019s not a single shit in these things!\u201dAnother person also said in distress: \u201cThe question is too vague. We don\u2019t even have a hint so how can we find it?\u201d\u00b7You Huo squatted next to the Hunter\u2019s dead body. He picked up a piece of the broken wine glass and started to examine it.To him, the question has already given them plenty of clues.When he was in the kitchen earlier and was messing with the hunter, he noticed that the other party paid special attention to these wine glasses and, when Hunter A dropped one of them, the question changed into \u201cThere are now 12 sets of tableware.\u201dThis would mean that, to the question, the only thing that counted as part of the tableware were the wine glasses.Therefore, the so-called secret must be hidden in the glasses.Yu Wen stared at the answer wall in thought for a moment. He then slapped his thigh and jumped up: \u201cOh\u2014\u2014\u2014brother, I finally get it! The others are all useless and only those glasses are part of the tableware!\u201dEveryone stood around dumbly with plates, forks and spoons in their hands.Yu Wen waved his hand and mobilised the group: \u201cDon\u2019t look at those, look at the glasses!\u201dPlease support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogHe rushed over and quickly stepped onto his brakes when he got near the hunter\u2019s body. He sat onto the floor and asked to be praised: \u201cAren\u2019t I pretty smart?\u201dYou Huo perfunctorily snorted.\u00b7However, the excitement didn\u2019t last long.After a while, the group was once again in despair.They had examined every one of them and even tried to warm it up with their breaths, heat them up and shake them. After turning it around and around a few times, nothing was found.On the sofa.922 squeezed his fingers and said: \u201cI\u2019m busting and I\u2019m also a little hungry. Was it always this hard doing full time on-site invigilating?\u201d154 said: \u201cHold it in. It\u2019s still too soon. There\u2019s still 36 hours.\u201d922 was in despair.Qin Jiu supported his head and his eyes swept past the dining table in the room before landing in a certain corner of the room.There, You Huo had his back towards him while he looked through the fragments of the wine glass. The curved back of his formed a very nice arc.He watched him for a long time and suddenly said: \u201cHave you guys seen him before?\u201d154 was confused: \u201cWhy?\u201d922 was even more so: \u201cAh?\u201dTheir reaction alone was enough.Qin Jiu fell silent for a moment. He then said lazily: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. If you\u2019re really hungry, you can go make something in the kitchen.\u201d154 and 922 looked over at the kitchen. They then said with a stiff expression: \u201cNot hungry at all.\u201dAfter a few more seconds, 922 rubbed his hands and stood up: \u201cUh\u2026..I\u2019ll go take a look in the kitchen.\u201d154 was impressed: \u201c\u2026\u2026..You can even make something in a kitchen like that?\u201d922: \u201cI\u2019m just taking a look.\u201dAfter he left, 154 once again looked back at the examinees. He suddenly understood the meaning behind Qin Jiu\u2019s words. He looked at You Huo and then hesitantly looked at Qin Jiu.After staring at him in silence for about a minute, his boss finally spoke up: \u201cHave I died? Why are you looking at me like I\u2019m a spirit?\u201d154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dQin Jiu glanced at him: \u201cSpit it out if you have something to say.\u201d154 pondered for a moment and said: \u201cI just wanted to say\u2026\u2026..If we have met before, that rule violating man gentleman should recognise us.\u201dQin Jiu\u2019s eyes once again returned to You Huo.After a moment he hummed in agreement.154 was right. If they have met before, he wouldn\u2019t have this kind of reaction.It\u2019s not like there would be another person who has lost a part of their memory like he had. It couldn\u2019t be that coincidental.\u00b7922 rummaged through the kitchen and finally decided to change locations.He returned back to the sofa and knelt onto the ground to open his suitcase. From inside, he took out a grill and a box of already cut up beef. The moment he opened the lid, he heard Yu Wen cry out nearby: \u201cBrother, don\u2019t be so reckless!!\u201dThe three invigilators looked over and just happened to see You Huo pick up the bottom of the shattered wine glass from in the Hunter\u2019s hands and smash it against the edge of the table.There was a crack.The bottom of the glass was once again broken\u2026\u2026..922\u2019s hands shook. The beef spilt onto his pants.Holding the remaining half-boxful of meat, he asked 154: \u201cCan we accept him as a colleague after violating the rules four times? I don\u2019t want to be his invigilator anymore.\u201d154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhich idiot would want to?The author has something to say:Qin Jiu: I doPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11: The Last SupperPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe examinees were shocked. Old Yu was so anxious, he jumped up: \u201cYou! Why did you?! Didn\u2019t they say that we can\u2019t break them?! But you\u2026\u2026\u2026.!\u201dYou Hou held the bottom of the glass and examined it. Without looking up, he answered: \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d922: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dCan you touch your conscience and say that again???Don\u2019t you feel embarrassed saying that after violating the rules so many times?The cabin fell silent for a few seconds.Almost everyone thought You Huo had once again violated the rules. They stared at the answer wall apprehensively and waited for the fourth notice of violation.No one knew what kind of punishment would be imposed on someone with four consecutive violations. Recalling the bald man going mad from just one round of punishment, they didn\u2019t dare think about it.For a moment, the notification area on the answer wall appeared to glow red but in a blink of an eye it returned to its usual appearance.It flickered red and white and then white and red. Like this, it went back an forth several times but in the end no words appeared.154 was dumbfounded.922 stood next too him adding fuel to the fire: \u201cIt feels like the system is about to explode\u2026..\u201dIn the end, the one who broke the silence was You Huo himself.He handed over the shattered end of the wine glass to Yu Wen and said: \u201cCheck and see if there\u2019s anything in it. My eyes feel uncomfortable.\u201dYu Wen who was on his knees panicked: \u201cBrother, it\u2019s against the rules to damage the tableware\u2026\u201dYou Huo moved away from the light and closed his eyes for a while. He then said in a calm voice: \u201cWith what eyes of yours did you see me damage the tableware?\u201dYu Wen held onto the broken glass and internally commented: Am I blind?You Huo: \u201cThe question said that there are a total of 12 sets of tableware. Can you count?\u201dYu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cShould I teach you?\u201dYu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone fell silent for a while. They then came to a realisation.That\u2019s right! The question clearly wrote that there are only 12 guests and 12 sets of tableware in the Hunter\u2019s cabin. The 12 sets of tableware are all on the dining table and numbered so it naturally didn\u2019t include the broken one.Regardless of whether the examination system did it unintentionally, it had already disregarded the broken wine glass as part of the tableware. What\u2019s wrong with breaking it again?\u201cBrother, let me call you daddy!\u201dYu Wen instantly came back to life. He raised the bottom half of the wine glass and held it against the light.Just as Old Yu wanted to knock them in their heads, he heard Yu Wen cry out in surprise: \u201cNo way! There really is something!\u201dAt the base of the wine glass was a slightly concave circle. Above it was the stem for people to hold onto. The stem had been broken off by You Huo and it was no longer even.Yu Wen changed the angle of the glass as he held it under the light from the oil lamp and fire. In a spider-like posture, he soon cried out: \u201cIt\u2019s this angle! If you look at it from here, you can see something!\u201dAll the examinees hurried over. They squeezed their heads over but couldn\u2019t find the right distance and angle.\u201cWhat is it? Where is it?\u201dThe tattooed man struggled for a moment before finally giving up: \u201cWhat did you see? Just spit it out!\u201dYu Wen: \u201cIf I could see it clearly, do you think I need to twist it around like this?\u201dJust as he was about to start arguing with the tattooed man, someone patted his shoulder.\u201cLet me look.\u201dThe one who spoke was You Huo.He closed his eyes to rest it up for a moment and, when his eyes felt a little better, he took the base of the wine glass from Yu Wen.\u201cHere, like this. You look from here.\u201d Yu Wen helpfully adjusted the angle and pointed at the place where the glass stem and the base met. \u201cIsn\u2019t there something there? I think it\u2019s some kind of picture, but I couldn\u2019t see it clearly. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s a picture or a word.\u201dYou Huo let out an \u201coh\u201d and once again knocked it.With a crack, the thin stem broke off cleanly from the base. It looked as if it was made so that it could easily be broken that way.\u201cThere\u2019s something!\u201d Yu Wen caught something that fell off from that connecting point and held it like he was holding his great ancestors.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogEveryone looked on intently. There really was a thin, round piece of paper. It wasn\u2019t much bigger than a pea. Before You Huo smashed the glass, it was probably hidden under the thin stem.The back of it was blank. It looked like a tiny mirror.The front of it had a few tiny letters:Simon the ZealotThe foreigner Mike read it out quietly.The two old ladies wrinkled their faces with confusion: \u201cWhat?\u201dMike: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dOld ladies: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt really killed him being unable to explain it in Chinese.After a moment of stunned silence, someone whispered: \u201cThe Last Supper.\u201d\u201cWho are you cursing?!\u201d The tattooed man glared at him angrily.The one who spoke was the sickly thin man. He had always looked like he was tired and depressed. He wasn\u2019t idle the whole time, but his presence was very low, so he was often overlooked.This was the first time everyone had their attention on him. Everyone waited for him to speak.They soon remembered that this man was called Zhou Jin.Zhou Jin looked feebly at the tattooed man and said: \u201cI was referring to Da Vinci\u2019s famous artwork \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d.\u201dThe tattooed man wanted to say something in response.Zhou Jin was afraid that he would ask a stupid question like \u201cWho\u2019s Da Vinci?\u201d so he quickly looked away and turned to You Huo: \u201cSimon the Zealot is one of the 12 apostles.\u201d\u201cDo you know all the 12 apostles?\u201d Yu Wen let out a cry of surprise.Zhou Jin coughed for a while and said in a quiet voice: \u201cI study art, so I happened to know a little about it.\u201dIt was both supper, and there were 12 apostles. These key words matched perfectly with their current predicament.Although the several old people present didn\u2019t know much about \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d, the twin elementary school girls called out a name: \u201cJudas!\u201d\u201cYes, Judas!\u201d Yu Wen and Yu Yao are not siblings, but they cooperated better than most brothers and sisters.In \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d, Judas was an infamous traitor amongst the 12 apostles. There was a feeling that they were getting close to the answer.Everyone was excited.However, when one of them picked up the knife, the others cried out: \u201cNo, not the name!\u201dOn the long wooden table, each set of tableware had their corresponding number. They shouldn\u2019t be writing the name \u201cJudas\u201d on the wall, they should be writing the number corresponding with the glass that contained Judas\u2019s name.The most impatient tattooed man rushed back over to the table. He picked up a glass and started to examine it.He saw with his own eyes a piece of paper falling out from between the stem and the base but when he held the glass, he couldn\u2019t find the paper no matter where he looked.The tattooed man\u2019s eyes were almost in contact with the base of the glass: \u201cWhy can\u2019t I see anything?\u201dIn fact, it wasn\u2019t just him. Everyone had examined the glasses earlier and, if they were able to find it so easily, would they have only found out about it now?Everyone knew that there was a name hidden in it, but they couldn\u2019t see it.And these glasses were different to the one on the ground. They cannot be smashed or damaged so they cannot open it from the base the way You Huo did.Yu Wen suddenly smacked his head: \u201cI know!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cRefraction!\u201d Yu Wen exclaimed, \u201cSister Yu Yao and I wrote about refraction here! The names are in the glasses and the reason why we can\u2019t see it is because\u2026\u2026.uh\u2026\u2026..the refraction isn\u2019t right! I forgot how to explain it. Anyway, I seem to recall doing a question like this.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThis unlucky child\u2019s explanation made them feel despair.Seeing that he was having so much difficulty just explaining it, it was hard for them to believe that he would know how to solve the problem.Even so, everyone still held onto their last strand of hope: \u201cWhat should we do to see it?\u201dYu Wen was ashamed: \u201cI\u2026\u2026.I didn\u2019t study physics in second and third year of high school so it\u2019s been at least two or three years since I did this question. I\u2026\u2026.forgot.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dI damn fucking knew it!\u00b7You Huo expressionlessly watched Dumb Yu.He had originally wanted to tolerate his nonsense for a while, but he saw the invigilators through the corners of his eyes.922 had dragged out a charcoal bin and had a grill set up. The remaining half a box of precious beef was carefully arranged on the grill.154 with a stiff expression would occasionally glance over at him. You couldn\u2019t tell if he was hungry or if he was just exasperated by his colleague\u2019s mentally retarded state.As for 001\u2026\u2026He didn\u2019t even need to move. Just sitting there was enough provocation and ridicule to him.You Huo looked away. He pulled off the set of keys from the Hunter\u2019s waist and walked over to the kitchen.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogThe thin paper was hidden between the stem and base of the glass and it was refracted through the glass. What should you do if you can\u2019t see it clearly at a normal angle?You naturally would need to refract it again.You Huo rummaged through the drawers and cabinets in the kitchen but wasn\u2019t able to find any water that he could use. Hunter A had mentioned that there would be wine but all he brought out were empty wine glasses.The only liquid in the kitchen was the blood on the ground.And they were almost all dried up now.The harder it is to find, the more important it is.This basically told You Huo that the key to the answer was here.He came out of the kitchen with keys and glanced around the cabin. His eyes finally fell to the room next door.The door with a rooster hanging from it was the only door that had not yet been opened. Without any hesitation, he pulled out the last key and inserted it into the keyhole.With a click, the door opened.The smell of old dust rushed out. You Huo covered his nose and used his hand to wave it away a few times.The room before him was small, like a storage room but there were no brooms or mops inside. There was only a single wooden stand on which a single bottle of wine sat.Everyone gathered over. You Huo walked out with the bottle of wine and said: \u201cFound it.\u201dYu Wen then belatedly slapped his thigh: \u201cYes, yes yes! Add water! I remember now!\u201dThe lid was pulled off and the strong, pungent smell of low-quality alcohol filled the cabin.This was the most important part of the Hunter\u2019s meal, but he never had the chance to enjoy it.You Huo poured the light amber coloured wine into glass number 1. Everyone stretched their necks out to watch while holding their breaths.\u201cAh, I see it, I see it!!!\u201d The drunkard Old Yu was most excited. He was the first one to call out.Another name appeared in the glass:Matthew.Zhou Jin also got excited: \u201cMatthew! That\u2019s right, this is \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d. Let\u2019s hurry and find Judas!\u201dEveryone started to move. One by one they poured the wine into the twelve glasses.The names of the apostles surfaced one after another:BartholomewJohnThomasPhilip\u2026\u2026..When they reached the eleventh glass, the bald man sitting in the twelfth seat was trembling.Only two names had not appeared yet, and they happened to be the two most important figures in this large masterpiece, Judas and Jesus.If Jesus\u2019s name appeared in the eleventh glass, it would mean that Judas is in the glass that he sat at so he would be the guest that would be cursed and was destined to die.The bald man was so scared, he was about to vomit. Even while he was in the confinement room and even when he saw the cut up bloody flesh sitting near the wine glasses, he didn\u2019t feel this scared.Afterall, they belonged to other people and this time it was he himself who was about to die.Suddenly, the group burst into cheers.Zhou Jin\u2019s voice was sandwiched between: \u201cJudas! Judas!\u201dThe bald man was stunned for a long time. He then collapsed weakly on the table.It\u2019s number 11!Thank god! Judas is number 11!It\u2019s not him! He\u2019s not getting his retribution\u2026\u2026\u2026\u00b7The knife was stuffed into Zhou Jin\u2019s hands and he revealed his first smile ever since he entered this cabin, \u201cI\u2019ll do it? Okay then, I\u2019ll do it\u2026\u2026.\u201dZhou Jin stood before the answering wall and took a deep breath. He slowly started to engrave the number \u201c1\u201d.Just when he was about to put the knife down again to engrave the second \u201c1\u201d, someone appeared behind him and grabbed his wrist.\u201cNo, we were almost misled.\u201dZhou Jin suddenly turned around and saw You Huo standing beside him. He calmly said: \u201cNot 11. It\u2019s 12.\u201dThe Last Supper. The person who ended up getting crucified was Jesus. The person who sat in that seat was the cursed guest.Judas was just a traitor.\u00b7The number 12 was engraved onto the answer wall.When You Huo lowered the knife, the radio which had been silent for a long time suddenly started to buzz.\u3010Correct answer detected.\u3011\u3010Examinees have submitted their answer ahead of time and have successfully completed this exam.\u3011\u3010Please wait for the final allocation of rewards and punishments\u3011How does it feel completing the exam 35 hours 22 minutes and 11 seconds in advance?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In special circumstances, there were opportunities to earn bonus points or have points demerited.\u00b7With the appearance of new content on the answer wall, everyone started to whisper quietly to each other.\u201cThere are two unknown questions at the beginning?\u201d\u201cYeah, the moment we started the exam we went straight into earning points for the third question. We must\u2019ve skipped over the first two questions.\u201d\u201cNo, the first points we got was from \u2018Answer\u2019.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLook at that sequence. The two points from \u2018Answer\u2019 is probably part of the unknown questions.\u201d\u201cThe points sister Yu Yao and I got probably also are counted as part of the unknown questions.\u201d\u201cSo, the first two questions were just a starter?\u201d\u201cCould it have been triggered by the Hunter?\u201d\u201cMaybe. Anyway, I don\u2019t want to know.\u201dThe accidental death of Hunter A had resulted in the two questions to be missed and the answer would now always be unknown.The total points from those two questions added up to ten points. It accounted for a lot, but no one felt regretful.If it wasn\u2019t because of You Huo, they would have already reached the heavens in the first round so they wouldn\u2019t know what could happen in the later rounds. After 48 hours, it was likely that 5 or even all of them would be dead.In a situation like this, who would care about having a chance to answer the question? They naturally wanted fewer and easier questions.They were just grateful to be alive.\u00b7The answering wall was still calculating their points:The word \u2018Answer\u2019: 2 points, Refraction: 3 points, Question 3: 6 points, bonus of 2 points, a deduction of two points for the legibility, question 4: 8 points.In total, they got 19 points. It was way beyond the average score of 11.The total time used was 12 hours 37 minutes and 49 seconds. Compared to the average time used, they had saved 35 hours 22 minutes and 11 seconds.Yu Wen let out an \u201cOhh\u201d and said to You Huo: \u201cHow did they calculate that the average time it takes for the exam to be done is 48 hours?\u201dInvigilator 154 couldn\u2019t listen to him anymore: \u201c48 hours is normal.\u201dYou should restrain yourself. Don\u2019t get too proud okay?But he then thought about it. In just twelve hours, and if he took away the three hours You Huo used to sleep and the three hours he used to clean up that disgusting room\u2026\u2026\u2026.In other words, if you didn\u2019t count the time that was spent in confinement, these people, no, this examinee would have completed the exam in less than 6 hours?Are you even human???\u00b7The non-human You Huo was rewarded accordingly for his achievement.The answer wall slowly issued another notice:Reward: Examinee You Huo has received the right to draw twice.\u201cRight to draw?\u201d You Huo furrowed his brows.He didn\u2019t know what its intentions were. Anyway, the answer wall appeared to have temporarily died. After saying \u201cReward for your efforts\u201d, it once again fell silent and no more words appeared.While he was deep in thought, there was a \u201cding\u201d sound in the cabin. It sounded like someone receiving a new notification.You Huo suddenly felt someone stand behind him. The hand brushed his cheek as it reached out from behind. The slender and angular fingers loosely held onto a box of poker cards as it waved it before his eyes.You Huo for a moment couldn\u2019t control his expression: \u201cIt\u2019s you again\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou can tell that it\u2019s me just by seeing my fingers?\u201dInvigilator 001 always spoke very carelessly. It made You Huo have the urge to hit him.Qin Jiu smiled and took a step back. He just managed to dodge You Huo\u2019s hand.\u201cThere\u2019s no point attacking me.\u201d Qin Jiu opened the box and pulled out the cards: \u201cHere, take your pick?\u201dEveryone heard this and started to huddle over.But they were still scared of Qin Jiu. They felt that even if he smiled, it wasn\u2019t out of friendliness.So they just formed a circle around them that was about four metres in diameter and stretched their necks out.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogThe back of the cards in Qin Jiu\u2019s hand was exactly the same, and the front had different contents in it. Some of there were very enticing, For example:> Total Score +15 (Single)> Total Score +10 (All)> Exemption (Single person, Single exam. Will receive the average score)\u2026\u2026.There was also some that were strange. For example:> Cheat sheet> Last minute cramming\u2026\u2026\u2026..Everyone could tell what it meant by just looking at the names, but they didn\u2019t know how it was going to work and whether it would be helpful in exams.Apart from these obvious rewards, there were also other ridiculous cards.You Huo scanned through them and saw about ten similar cards with contents like:> Outstanding Examinee. Please keep up your hard work.> Amazing Student. You will be rewarded for your efforts.> Top Student. Please accept our praise.Anyway, he didn\u2019t understand what good it would bring to him by selecting a certificate of merit like these in a place like this.The translation of it was probably: Thank you for your patronage. Please try again.You Huo pointed at some of the special cards and asked: \u201cWhat do the black cards mean? Punishment?\u201dSome of the cards were completely black and there was nothing written on it. It didn\u2019t look like a good card.Qin Jiu pulled one out and showed it to You Huo. He dragged his tone out and said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a punishment but it is a bit special. At least, it\u2019s not considered a reward you would expect.\u201d\u201cA black card represents the chance to reform the exam. It can take place on that very day.\u201dThe faces of several young people in the room instantly turned green.\u201cThere\u2019s even a chance to reform the exam?\u201d Yu Wen was especially green.His three years of high school life was battered with exam reformations. Whenever anything is changed, their study plans would be changed accordingly. Today it may be 3+2 and tomorrow the 2 would be changed to your school ranking.He didn\u2019t expect that, despite finishing his university entrance examinations, he still couldn\u2019t hide from reformations.While the onlookers had a bad expression, Qin Jiu pulled out another card from the box: \u201cI almost missed this one. There\u2019s also this card. You guys might like it.\u201d> Guaranteed Pass (Single)The cabin went quiet for a moment. Murmuring and excited discussions then filled the room.\u201cThis guaranteed pass\u2026\u2026..is this what I think it means?\u201d The person asking was Zhou Jin.Because he was sick and he couldn\u2019t become too excited, he became the only calm one amongst the group of onlookers: \u201cDoes this mean\u2026\u2026.No need to do the examination?\u201dBefore Qin Jiu was about to say something, 922 interjected. He seemed to be particularly fond of introducing this \u201cGuaranteed Pass\u201d card.\u201cIt make look similar to the Exemption card, but the exemption card only applies to one subject and you would receive the average score instead. It can be said that it is a very safe card that gives you an adequate amount of benefit.\u201d922 said: \u201cBut the Guaranteed Pass card is different. It is the true trump card. There is only one in each deck. If you draw it, it means that you have passed all the exams and can eat and sleep without a worry\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cBy the time you open your eyes again, you are back home.\u201dHome?Hearing this word, everyone in the room was stunned.During the past 12 hours, they didn\u2019t dare think of something like this. Their lives depended on their companions and luck so how could they dare to even expect being able to go home?But now, this guaranteed pass card had aroused everyone\u2019s desire to go home.Old Yu bravely asked: \u201cIf we don\u2019t have this card, how long does it take for us to go back?\u201d922 thought about it and said: \u201cIt would be according to the current examination rules. You just need to meet the two conditions of completing all the prescribed subjects and having a passing score.\u201dOld Yu seemingly wanted to say something else, but Qin Jiu had already stored the Guaranteed Pass card away and he shuffled the deck a few times. He then fanned It out with the back of the cards facing up and said to You Huo: \u201cHere. You have two chances. Come and draw.\u201dYou Huo however didn\u2019t move. He turned to the others and said: \u201cWhoever is lucky, come and draw.\u201dAs soon as he said that, the radio started to buzz:\u3010Warning: Examinees are not allowed to transfer their drawing opportunities.\u3011You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dPlease support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blog\u201cThe system issued the warning. What are you glaring at me for?\u201d Qin Jiu raised his chin and said lazily: \u201cDon\u2019t rely on your good looks as a weapon1. Hurry and draw.\u201dFuck you and that damned weapon.You Huo stared at Qin Jiu with an icy cold expression for several seconds. He then forcefully pulled out a card.The crowd who didn\u2019t have a chance to draw a card were extremely nervous. They held their breaths and stared at the card.You Huo flipped it over:> Top student. Please accept our praise.Note: This is a recognition of this examinee\u2019s abilities. Please strive to maintain this momentum.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe annoyances are endless. What dog shit luck.The radio spoke up in an untimely manner:\u3010You have used your first drawing opportunity.\u3011Qin Jiu used his tongue to poke at the sides of his cheek and the corner of his lips were slightly raised: \u201cNot bad. One more time.\u201dYou Huo had nothing to lose. He pulled another one out.Yu Wen who stood on the sidelines had his hand clasped tightly together and was praying fervently. Perhaps his prayers were answered because at least he didn\u2019t receive another merit of certificate card.You Huo turned the card over:> Invigilator\u2019s HelpNote: Your outstanding performance has won over the invigilators favour. You have the right to make a request to an invigilator for extra help during the exam and the invigilator is obliged to help you. The card will be valid until the end of the next exam.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dYou Huo felt that every word on this card was filled with mockery.Fortunately, he quickly restored his expression back to his usual indifferent look. He asked Qin Jiu: \u201cAre the invigilators for each exam fixed?\u201dQin Jiu said: \u201cOf course not. Every time you do a new subject, the invigilators will be randomly refreshed.\u201d\u00b7The radio started to buzz:\u3010A total of two drawing opportunities have been used. The drawing is over. Congratulations.\u3011As soon as those words were spoken, the answer wall that had been silent the entire time revealed new content:Punishment: The guest sitting in the cursed seat has avoided death and will become the new hunter.\u00b7When the second half of the sentence appeared, everyone read the words, but they couldn\u2019t understand the meaning behind it.Or more precisely\u2026\u2026. They didn\u2019t dare understand what it meant.\u201cWhat does it mean by becoming the new Hunter?\u201d Someone mumbled.An agonising scream suddenly filled the room.Everyone stiffly turned their necks.The bald man sitting in seat number 12 was finally sitting up straight. His eyes widened and he looked fearfully at his hands.His original complexion quickly faded and it became grey and pale.His lips turned bright red. Against the pale skin, the slit for his mouth spread open to both sides. Strange horns grew and eerie spots also appeared on his hands and fingers.The bald man looked up in confusion. After being frozen for a moment, he suddenly twisted his neck and stiffly stood up.He slowly began to look more and more like the dead hunter. Only his face still retained the original fearful expression.\u201cNo, no, no. This can\u2019t be\u2026\u2026. Don\u2019t go! Stay with me. Please stay with me, okay?\u201dHe muttered these words and rushed towards the group.Whoosh\u2014\u2014\u2014An unknown source of wind and snow blew past. It covered their faces and made it difficult for them to keep their eyes open.They subconsciously covered their faces using their arms and, when they opened their eyes again, the cabin was gone and the bald man who had turned into the hunter had also disappeared. Even the three invigilators were nowhere in sight.They stood in the heavy snow field. Before them was a pinewood forest and a small road could be seen nestled within it.1: \u6043\u9753\u884c\u51f6: \u201c\u6043\u201dmeans \u201crely on,\u201d \u201c\u9753\u201dmeans \u201cgood looks,\u201d\u201c\u884c\u51f6\u201dmeans \u201ccommit acts of violence.\u201d This four-character term can be translated as \u201crelying on one\u2019s good looks to be arrogant and aggressive.\u201d It can refer to making good use of one\u2019s special advantages to achieve difficult tasks or goals.

    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: Rest StopPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe travel down the mountain was very long. Everyone was extremely silent as they walked.Half of the reason was because they were scared by the bald man turning into the hunter, and the other half was because they were freezing cold.This group of people walked on for about half an hour before the static scenery finally started to change. The endless pine trees suddenly opened up and the road they were walking along connected with a larger road at the base of the mountain. There was a stone monument sitting next to the road.On one side it wrote: Jiming Mountain.1The other side wrote: 100m ahead.The name Jiming Mountain reminded them of the dead chickens hanging from the doors in the hunter\u2019s cabin. It was clearly referring to the mountain they had come down from.As for the 100m ahead sign, it was pointing down the larger road\u2026\u2026Snow and mist obstructed their views and they couldn\u2019t see anything clearly.\u201cW-w-what does it m-mean by 100m ahead? The bottom half is b-b-buried in the snow?\u201d Yu Wen\u2019s lips trembled. He was so cold, he was stuttering.He walked over with both his hands in his pockets and, unwilling to pull it out, he scraped at the snow on the monument with his shoes.Everyone asked: \u201cWhat does it say?\u201dYu Wen tremblingly walked back: \u201cThe dirt is all f-f-frozen solid. Can\u2019t scrape it off.\u201dThe monument still only revealed the words \u2018100m ahead\u2019. Apart from it becoming clearer, there weren\u2019t any other changes.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s another\u2026\u2026..\u201d Zhou Jin\u2019s face was frozen cold, and he looked like a ghost.Yu Wen: \u201cN-n-no way. We just finished an e-e-exam. Aren\u2019t they j-just forcing us to die?\u201dEveryone fell silent. They were hesitant about moving forward.\u201cDid many die?\u201d You Huo threw this sentence out and walked ahead.His voice really suited this snowy cold environment. The words that came out whenever he opened his mouth could easily freeze the others up.Everyone shivered as they looked at each other. They then quickly followed behind him.\u00b7With You Huo leading the group, their pace wasn\u2019t slow.Soon, an outline of a house appeared amidst the fog and snow.The hunter\u2019s cabin still left a psychological shadow in their hearts so the moment they saw this house, they weren\u2019t very surprised.But they soon realised that there wasn\u2019t just one house.They walked up a gentle slope and saw that there were several houses scattered sparsely ahead.If you called it a small town, then it would be too much of an exaggeration. It was more like those unpopular scenic spots on a mountain where local residents would try to get some business from occasional tourists. When it doesn\u2019t get enough business each year, it would always be ready to close down.The house closest to them hung a small lightbox. On the white background, red words wrote: Accommodation, Heating, Catering.The focus was obvious, and it was very enticing.The group could no longer move anymore.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we make do and stay overnight here?\u201d Old Yu said carefully.He thought he would get a glare of objection from You Huo because it was difficult to tell whether or not it was safe.But in the end, his nephew entered the house faster than anyone else.\u00b7You Huo had long been hungry.While they trekked through the snow, his last regret was that he had submitted the answer too soon.If he waited a few minutes longer, 922\u2019s meat would\u2019ve been done.It\u2019s all that 001 invigilator\u2019s fault for being such an eye thorn and stealing him of his food.Just thinking of Qin Jiu\u2019s face\u2026\u2026..You Huo touched his earring. His mood was poor.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogAnd so, the moment the staff at the front desk looked up, he was greeted with his cold expression.Front desk: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe staff at the front desk was a young and skinny man. He fell silent for a few seconds before turning around and shouting: \u201cBoss! Someone\u2019s here!\u201d\u201cWhat are you shouting for? If someone\u2019s here, can\u2019t you greet them?\u201d The person who answered was a female. Her voice was crisp, and you could feel the force in her voice even through the door.\u201cI\u2019m afraid of scaring them away.\u201d The front desk glanced at You Huo and spoke timidly.\u201cIn a damned place like this, where can they run off too?\u201d The door along the corridor opened and a short haired woman walked out while wielding a kitchen knife.The front desk was startled. Even You Huo was stunned.\u201cBoss, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d The short haired woman said: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to eat at the cafeteria today, so I got some things from next door to make something myself.\u201dShe lowered the knife and smiled at You Huo: \u201cWow, a handsome guy! Just finished an exam? Let Xiao Hu register you down.\u201dWith the boss behind his back, the front desk Xiao Hu said to You Huo: \u201cCan I get your name? Let me see how long you guys can stay.\u201dOld Yu and the others walked in while rubbing their hands. Hearing their words, his expression wasn\u2019t great.\u201cJust finished an exam? How did you know\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe boss raised her elegant eyebrow. She smiled like a mountain monster: \u201cThose words are really strange. Please take a look at this line here, okay?\u201dShe used her knife to tap at the front desk. The front desk Xiao Hu obediently moved aside to reveal the complete wall. It read:\u201cExaminee\u2019s Rest Stop.\u201dExaminee\u2019s rest stop????Everyone\u2019s expression had turned even more ugly.Zhou Jin murmured, \u201cI thought\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe boss didn\u2019t find this reaction strange: \u201cYou thought you weren\u2019t far from the city? That\u2019s normal. It must be your first time going to a rest stop? Everyone\u2019s like this.\u201dOld Yu asked: \u201cAlso, what do you mean taking a look to see how long we can stay? We can\u2019t decide how long we can stay?\u201dThe boss laughed even harder: \u201cYou wish.\u201dOld Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright! No more jokes!\u201d The boss said, \u201cAfter you complete each exam, you will be given an allocated number of days to rest. These are all in the rules. It\u2019s not a matter of staying here as long as you want. Stop wasting time here and hurry up and report your names! Don\u2019t block the door.\u201dThe tattooed man was unhappy when he heard this. He exploded aggressively: \u201cFuck this stupid place! It\u2019s clearly wanting us to die. You can stay here if you want, I\u2019m leaving!\u201dWhat they didn\u2019t expect was that the boss was even more aggressive.She slammed the kitchen knife into the front desk causing Xiao Hu to jump almost three feet high.\u201cGo. If you don\u2019t go, then you\u2019re my grandson.\u201d The boss said this to the tattooed man and pointed at the door.Tattooed man: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe glared at her angrily, tightened his collar, pulled up his zip until it reached his mouth and turned out and left.\u00b7There was strong tension at the front desk.The others looked at the kitchen knife lodged in the front desk. It wasn\u2019t a good idea to leave and it also wasn\u2019t a good idea to stay. Only You Huo reported his name without a change in his expression.Xiao Hu tapped on the keyboard and said: \u201cFound it. You can stay here a total of seven days. From this moment\u2014\u2014-\u201dHe turned to look at the clock on the wall: \u201cFrom 3:12pm. You can check out at 3:12pm seven days later. This is your room card.\u201dYou Huo received his room card.The room number was written on the front. You Huo was staying at 404.The boss glanced at it and added: \u201cOh that\u2019s right. Here we don\u2019t avoid any numbers so if you are assigned numbers like 404, 414\u2026\u2026.It\u2019s all life so don\u2019t take it too personally. Afterall, even if you don\u2019t stay in a room with the number 4, it doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t die, right?\u201d2Those words of hers comforted everyone there until their faces turned green.You Huo didn\u2019t look up. He turned the card over.The first line on the back wrote:Examinee\u2019s Rest Stop. Manager: Chu YueBelow that was something that looked like an examination ticket:Name: You HuoTicket Number: 860451-10062231-000ACompleted subjects: PhysicsTotal points: 19Boss Chu Yue finally revealed a surprised look: \u201cYou got 19 points in one subject. Amazing!\u201dYou Huo coldly looked up.Chu Yue: \u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m just praising you. Praising that you have a face that brings calamity3. You have a good name!\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dShe didn\u2019t wait for You Huo to speak and proceeded to return to back into the house while laughing loudly.Xiao Hu thought for a moment and told You Huo his rehearsed lines: \u201cHot water is available, and heating is in place. For those who have just entered, don\u2019t rush to heat up your hands and burrow in your blankets. In a moment, I will bring you a bucket of snow and alcohol. You should warm up the exposed arms and lefts first before entering. The meals will be served at 7am, 11am and 5pm. The dining room is on the first floor around that corner. The meal time will go for two hours and it will be stopped at 9am, 1pm and 7pm. The chef has a bad temper, so he won\u2019t serve you before or after that.\u201dYou Huo heard this and nodded: \u201cAnything to eat?\u201dXiao Hu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..won\u2019t serve you\u2026.\u201dYou Huo looked at him.He looked at You Huo.Two seconds later, Xiao Hu turned his head and shouted: Boss! The guests want to eat!\u201d\u00b7Boss Chu claims to be a superficial person and would do things while taking into consideration other people\u2019s appearances.Fortunately, there was You Huo amongst this group of examinees.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogAnd so, they didn\u2019t wait long after warming up and they all sat in the dining room eating the dumplings made personally by Boss Chu herself.Yu Wen shouted saying that he wasn\u2019t hungry, but he ate like crazy.With hot food filling their stomachs, their tense mood finally relaxed.Everyone started to feel a little drowsy and they leaned against each other in daze.Chu Yue said: \u201cThis group of examinees\u2019 is very interesting.\u201dYou Huo looked at her.On a snowy day like this, Chu Yue was holding onto a glass of cold beer. She took a sip and explained: \u201cThe group that checked in yesterday morning only had three people. Oh\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cShe pointed at the roof: \u201cExcept for meals, they basically don\u2019t come out at all. They don\u2019t even come out for all the meals and would just eat a few mouthfuls. Sometimes they would just sit there in daze or cry.\u201d\u201cThree people? What exam did they take? How many people were there when they went in?\u201d Yu Wen asked.\u201cThe same as you.\u201d Chu Yue answered as a matter of factly: \u201cRecently all the people staying here at my place have taken the same exam.\u201dYu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026..Same exam? The hunter one? Only three people left?\u201dChu Yue said: \u201cThree people is actually a little few. But at most it\u2019s usually five or six people. That\u2019s the norm.\u201d\u201cHow many groups have you received?\u201d Yu Wen recalled the bald man turning into the hunter and rubbed the goosebumps that formed: \u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean that there are lots of hunters?\u201dChu Yue said: \u201cOf course not. When I said the same exam, I meant the same exam centre. You can only go in after they\u2019re done.\u201dShe lowered her voice and said secretively: \u201cDid you know? In some exam centres, you can still find some traces left by previous examinees. Last time I heard someone picked up a finger bone and there was also another person who picked up a ring.\u201d\u201cYou can try looking for it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: CrossroadPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHumans are very resilient creatures.The next day, everyone had adapted to their life living in the examinee\u2019s rest stop.Although it was not a town, when compared to the hunter\u2019s cabin, it was much better.There was food to eat, they could sleep at ease, they wouldn\u2019t die by going out and there weren\u2019t any chickens chasing after you reminding you to submit your answers.Opposite the rest stop was a house that was three storeys high. It hung heavy plastic curtains that had turned yellow with age and is no longer transparent. Only a faint circle of incandescent light could be seen emanating from within.There was a wooden sign displayed outside. The word \u201cWarehouse\u201d was written.\u201cWhat\u2019s a warehouse?\u201d The twin girls asked in unison.Old Yu was very patient with children. He explained: \u201cIt\u2019s like a grocery store. It sells everything. You haven\u2019t seen it before?\u201dNot only the girls, many others also shook their heads. They said: \u201cWhere we come from, we don\u2019t call it that.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Old Yu muttered.He was rather crafty so when he followed everyone in, he immediately tried to chat with the owner. After exchanging a few words, he found out that the owner was from the same town.The owner of the warehouse was surnamed Zhao. He was a very unfriendly fellow townsman.\u201cBig brother. I\u2019ll call you big brother now.\u201d Old Yu said this passionately.The owner Zhao Ding was at most fourty years old and is definitely younger than Old Yu. He had a strong build and a straight back, yet he shamelessly acknowledged this \u201cbig brother\u201d nickname. Holding his cigarette, he said monotonously: \u201cUp to you.\u201dOld Yu said: \u201cBig brother, you must have been away from home for many years. My accent isn\u2019t strong but yours is even more so. If not for seeing the word \u201cWarehouse\u201d, I wouldn\u2019t have noticed.\u201dSmoke constantly poured out from Zhao\u2019s mouth: \u201cI guess.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve always had a shop here?\u201dZhao: \u201cYeah.\u201dOld Yu let out an \u201coh\u201d and tentatively asked: \u201cLooking at brother\u2019s posture, were you a soldier before? Why did you come here to open a shop?\u201dZhao finally glanced at him from amidst the smoke. He said a long sentence: I haven\u2019t but seeing your posture, were you really once a soldier? How did you become fat like this?\u201dOld Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dZhao inhaled the cigarette a few times and extinguished it after only the butt was left: \u201cDon\u2019t try to act close. It\u2019s not going to work here. You may be acting all touched today but you might be dead tomorrow.\u201dOld Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re going to buy something, hurry up and do it. If not, leave.\u201d Zhao said this and pulled out a new cigarette.\u00b7The first floor of the warehouse was covered in smoke. The sick patient Zhou Jin went in and left immediately with a coughing fit. But he didn\u2019t give up the opportunity to shop.Because there were more things in this store than he had imagined.It looked more like a comprehensive supermarket with a shabby external appearance. There were clothes, blankets, pillows, pots, pans, cups, spoons, chopsticks, medications and anything you would want to find in a supermarket. Things that you don\u2019t find in a supermarket were also here. From the first to the third floor, it was completely filled.Every floor had several shopping carts which were coated in a layer of dust.They all pushed a cart each and started to sweep through the goods like crazy. It was as if ghosts had just entered the village.\u201cWait, none of these things are priced!\u201d Yu Wen suddenly cried out.Zhou Jin picked up a few bottles of cough syrup and also a box of anti-inflammatory pain medications: \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that a long time ago. Cough, cough\u2026\u2026\u2026..This is probably like those at tourist attractions. The price must have been doubled.\u201d\u201cTaking advantage of us while we\u2019re on the brink of death and ripping us off. It\u2019s expected.\u201d Everyone agreed.If you are not reading this from kktranslates then the translation was stolen.Please support the original translatorEveryone knew this truth, but no one stopped their actions.When money could be exchanged for their life, they don\u2019t feel bad about spending it.Yu Wen still felt that something wasn\u2019t right. He pushed his cart around to find his brother and found You Huo standing in the corner of the third floor.What surprised him was that You Huo was also purchasing goods.\u201cBrother, you\u2019re also pushing a cart?\u201d Yu Wen went over and asked.You Huo heard this and glanced at him. His expression seemed to be saying \u2018What nonsense are you spouting?\u2019.Yu Wen awkwardly waved his hand and said: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I was just looking\u2026..\u201dIf even his brother is buying something, then it should be okay.Yu Wen felt relieved and started to flip through You Huo\u2019s shopping cart.He had originally thought that he would see a bunch of emergency equipment such as flashlights, batteries, ropes, knifes\u2026\u2026..But all this great master got was a change of clothes and a black backpack.That was it.\u201cUh\u2026..Brother, are you getting anything else?\u201d Yu Wen asked.You Huo flipped through the hangers and took out a black down jacket. He threw it into the cart: \u201cJust these.\u201dYu Wen suddenly felt that he, with the light sticks, flashlights, batteries and the such\u2026\u2026.., was like an idiot attending a concert.\u00b7When they returned to the first floor, everyone had almost picked out everything that they needed and they all pushed their cart over to the checkout counter.You Huo didn\u2019t like crowds so he stood away from them and waited lazily by the wall.The old lady at the front asked the owner: \u201cJust these. How much is it?\u201dZhao had already smoked several cigarettes. Looking through the smoke, he scanned through the items in the cart. He snorted inexplicably: \u201cYou can tell in one glance it\u2019s your first time.\u201dEveryone didn\u2019t understand.Zhao: \u201cWhen people come here, they would only be brave enough to take this number of items.\u201dHe raised two fingers.\u201cWhat do you mean brother? Two items?\u201d Old Yu asked.Zhao: \u201cYes. And that\u2019s the most generous one.\u201dHow fucking expensive is it?Everyone silently glanced at their carts filled with items. Zhou Jin finally couldn\u2019t help and ask: \u201c\u2026\u2026Can we use WeChat, Alipay1? Or card? I don\u2019t have much cash.\u201dYu Wen added: \u201cI haven\u2019t taken out cash in years.\u201dZhao: \u201cWechat, Alipay doesn\u2019t work here.\u201dZhou Jin and Yu Wen were disappointed.Zhao also said: \u201cCash is also not accepted.\u201dYu Wen: \u201cHuh? Then what do we use?\u201dZhao pulled out a card from under the counter. It looked exactly like the small room card they had received earlier.\u201cDo you all have this? You use this.\u201d Zhao flicked the cart while showing enthusiasm that he had not shown the entire time. He smiled and said: \u201cIsn\u2019t there an exam ticket at the back of the card? Do you see the points? The things here in my shop are bought with those points.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not expensive. Daily necessities, including clothing of any kind is 0.5. Food, medicines etc is 1 point. As for knives and anything that can be used as a weapon, it\u2019s 2 points. It\u2019s very easy to remember. Do you want to calculate the price yourself first?\u201dEveryone froze on the spot. Their faces were pale.Just the items in their shopping carts were enough to give them a negative score.Zhou Jin looked at his cart filled with medicine and gasped. He started coughing violently.No wonder\u2026\u2026.No wonder these shopping carts were coated with dust. No wonder even the most generous people would only take two items.The points that they have were all earned with their blood, sweat and tears. No one knew what the next exam would be like.If they bought one or two things here and end up just one point away from passing when they calculate the cumulative score, they would probably cut their stomachs open in regret.Zhao didn\u2019t find this scene strange.After scaring them, he reverted back to his usual lukewarm attitude and said: \u201cHere, I\u2019ll check it out.\u201dAs soon as he said that, the people around the counter took two steps back.\u201cNo one\u2019s buying?\u201d You Huo who stood waiting by the wall suddenly spoke up.Everyone, including the owner, set their sights on him.He straightened up, pushed the cart over to the counter and took out the room card from his jeans pocket. Handing it to Zhao, he said: \u201cCheckout.\u201dZhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe looked at the items in You Huo\u2019s cart with an open mouth. The cigarette butt fell onto his shoe.You Huo held onto the card waiting for a while and appeared to be slightly impatient.Zhou snapped back to his senses and hurriedly extinguished the cigarette butt with his foot: \u201cI\u2019ll check it out\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dThe clothes, jeans, black bag and down jacket added up to a total of three points.You Huo heard this and nodded.He seemed to think that he still had plenty to spare and started to scan across the shelf behind the owner. He then said: \u201cAdd another pack of cigarettes and a lighter.\u201dZhao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dYu Wen couldn\u2019t hold back: \u201cBrother, you don\u2019t even smoke so why are you buying this?\u201dYou Huo placed the clothes into the black bag and said without raising his head, \u201cJust in case.\u201dTwo minutes later, You Huo returned to his room with the bag hanging from one of his shoulders. The points on his examination ticket was now 15 points and, in a speed faster than someone falling from a building, he had become the one in the group with the lowest score.Yu Wen looked at his unchanging expression and felt that his brother was really tough.\u00b7Seven days at the examinee\u2019s rest stop passed in a blink of an eye.At 3:12pm on the last day, the entire group checked out and Boss Chu personally kicked them out the door.\u201cHere, go straight ahead. There is a crossroad 200 metres ahead. Now go.\u201d Chu Yue waved at them and said, \u201cDon\u2019t waste anymore time. It won\u2019t be good when it gets too late. I hope this isn\u2019t our last farewell.\u201dShe said that and then closed the door.The lightbox with \u201cAccommodation. Heating. Catering.\u201d flashed a few times before suddenly going out.These houses still remained standing amongst the snow and fog but, with none of their lights on, they looked like houses that had been abandoned for many years.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blog\u201cThis really isn\u2019t a haunted house?\u201d Yu Wen shuddered.You Huo recalled the invigilators\u2019 words.He had asked if this was a supernatural event, but the invigilator\u2019s response was no. The other party had wanted to something else at that time but, before he was able to speak, he had received a warning.So\u2026\u2026..What exactly is this?You Huo mulled over this inside. When the next exam starts, he will find a chance to trick the invigilator into spilling the truth.Hopefully the invigilator this time is one that is honest and easy to fool.\u00b7200 metres wasn\u2019t very far.Everyone very quickly arrived at the place mentioned by Chu Yue.It was indeed a crossroad. A solitary pavilion sat in the middle of the intersections and a figure was slumped against it.That person saw them and struggled to stand up.When they got closer, they saw that it was the tattooed man who didn\u2019t want to stay at the rest stop.But, compared to his appearance at that time, he was now covered in blood and his left arm hung lifelessly beside him. One of his legs was also broken.\u201cHow did you become like this?\u201dAlthough they didn\u2019t like him very much, no one wanted him to die or become disabled. Afterall, he was originally just a stranger and they held no grudges against him.The tattooed man said with a hoarse voice: \u201cIt\u2019s good enough not becoming crazy.\u201d\u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d Everyone looked at the pavilion.The tattooed man said: \u201cTwo days.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go to the examinee rest stop?\u201dThe tattooed man revealed an embarrassed expression which also held a hint of anger: \u201cIf I go back, I\u2019ll be her grandson. Also\u2026\u2026.I couldn\u2019t find the way back after I left. All I could find was this.\u201d\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you continue on?\u201d Yu Wen asked.The tattooed man swept his eyes across and pointed at the roads: \u201cLook at those signs yourself.\u201dWith his reminder, everyone now noticed that there was a sign erected at each of the four roads.Under normal circumstances, those signs would say xx road or xx street.But this wasn\u2019t the case here.The four signs each said respectively:ChineseForeign LanguageMathHistoryInside the pavilion, a small horn suddenly sounded and the familiar voice that was heard from the radio once again appeared here.\u3010This round of exam is designed to be 3+1+1.2 Congratulations on successfully completing one of them, there are currently four other exams pending.\u3011\u3010Examinees have the right to choose and can complete them in any order.\u3011\u3010Please make your choice within 30 seconds.\u3011\u3010Latecomers will have their examination opportunity stripped.\u3011Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt a crossroad like this, they would rather remain in place until they died.The dog Yu Wen grabbed You Huo and said: \u201cBrother, I\u2019ll choose whatever you choose!\u201dThe others all looked over at him.What they didn\u2019t expect was for You Huo to look around and say expressionlessly: \u201cThere\u2019s a choice? From my perspective, all of the signs are saying Foreign Language.\u201dYu Wen: \u201cHuh???\u201dWhat was even more frustrating was, in You Huo\u2019s eyes, he could see a figure standing at the end of every intersection.That figure was tall. Standing under an umbrella in the snow, that person appeared to be waiting for him.You Huo coldly sneered. His face was green with anger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Who?\u201dYou Huo\u2019s eyes looked into the distance: \u201cFor example, a particularly clingy invigilator.\u201dYu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..Don\u2019t say something so scary!\u201dThey haven\u2019t even selected their subject yet so why would an invigilator be here??The others heard You Huo\u2019s words and also looked around. Apart from the signs at the four ends, it was completely empty.\u201cForget it. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d You Huo said, \u201cI only see Foreign Language from my end, so I don\u2019t have any other options. You sure you\u2019re coming with me?\u201dYu Wen said: \u201cActually, Foreign Language is my weakness.\u201dYou Huo glanced at him.Yu Wen then said: \u201cBut after thinking about it, it seems like all of them are my weaknesses.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dYu Wen placed his hands together and worshipped his great master: \u201cBrother, I\u2019ll go whereever you go! I\u2019ll do whatever you want me to so please bless me and help me pass. I wish you longevity.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe group of people all looked at him eagerly.You Huo snorted and pulled the zipper of his jacket all the way up to cover his chin and lips before muttering lazily: \u201cTroublesome.\u201d\u201cBrother, what did you say?\u201d Yu Wen didn\u2019t hear clearly and moved closer.You Huo\u2019s face was almost as cold as a block of ice: \u201cI said, which direction is Foreign Language for you?\u201dEveryone pointed to the left.You Huo lifted his feet and walked over.Inside the pavilion, the small horn once again sounded.\u3010A friendly reminder that there are only 5 seconds left until selection time is over.\u3011Everyone was startled. They quickly started to run over.The road labelled \u201cForeign Language\u201d was no different from the other three roads and was covered in dense fog. No one knew what was waiting behind the fog\u2026..\u30104 seconds\u3011\u30103 seconds\u3011\u30102 seconds\u3011\u30101 second\u3011\u3010Self-selection is over.\u3011As the countdown reached zero, the last of their group managed to step into the dense fog.\u00b7Qin Jiu wore a long black coat and he had a dove-grey cashmere scarf around his neck. With one hand in his coat pocket, he used his other hand to hold a black umbrella as he waited calmly for the others to arrive.You Huo\u2019s tall figure passed through the dense fog.His face was cold and his expression lazy. A black backpack hung loosely from his right shoulder.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogDespite clearly being quite far away, Qin Jiu could still see everything in detail. The other party\u2019s light brown eyes always looked like it was covered by a layer of clear glass. Together with the earring on one side, it emitted a cold light.Qin Jiu lifted the umbrella slightly and white snow slid off it while following its curves.Seeing You Huo come closer, he politely moved his hand and brought You Huo under the umbrella. He dragged out his tone and said: \u201cWhat a coincidence, we meet again. Did Mr. Humph sleep well the past few days?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dDespite clearly knowing his name, he still addressing him using a dumb nickname. Is there something wrong with him?He stared at Qin Jiu for a few seconds and said coldly: \u201cDeprivation of choice means that you\u2019re going to be everywhere?\u201dQin Jiu squinted his eyes and smiled: \u201cThat\u2019s not exactly the case. The so-called deprivation of choice means that the examinee \u2013 that is, you \u2013 would lose their right to choose their text examination subject. As for the subject that you will do, it will depend on the main invigilator \u2013 that is, me \u2013 and the exam that I\u2019ll be invigilating. Understand?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThat tone of his sounded like he was explaining to a little kid.It was an obvious case of deliberate provocation. You Huo who heard this was irritated and his expression was completely cold.Qin Jiu saw his expression and smiled even more deeply: \u201cAs for the subject the invigilator supervises, in general we can choose but I\u2019m a little lazy, so I always select it randomly. This time I randomly got Foreign Languages. However, it seems from your expression that you\u2019re not happy with it. Next time\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dYou Huo interrupted him with a bad expression: \u201cThere\u2019s still a fucking next time?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. After all, you have an extensive criminal record.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cYou can tell me in advance if there\u2019s a subject you want to do. If you perform well, I can consider it.\u201dYou Huo wanted to say: I want you to go die. Can you consider that?But he thought about it. Considering how retarded the system is, it would probably even make him go die with him.And so he just held back his belly filled with anger and maintained a dark expression as he waited next to the thick fog.\u00b7After a while, Yu Wen came out from the fog while dragging Old Yu. This was then followed by Yu Yao and Mike.\u201cBrother!\u201d Yu Wen hurried over. As soon as he saw Qin Jiu, he came to a sudden stop: \u201cYou- Why are you here sir?\u201dHis strong desire for survival made him change his way of addressing him but he couldn\u2019t hide his shocked expression.Qin Jiu said slowly: \u201cI\u2019m accompanying your brother waiting for you.\u201dYu Wen looked even more horrified. He looked at You Huo with a terrified look.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dIf glares could kill, Qin Jiu would already be long dead.Yu Wen said bravely: \u201cSo the fulltime on-site monitoring carries over to this round too?\u201dQin Jiu glanced at him.Yu Wen: \u201cOh.\u201dAnd so, in classmate Yu (very pathetic) Wen\u2019s eyes, this invigilator 001 was also another great master. Great masters are always arrogant and would only be interested in speaking with other amazing characters like his brother.He knew himself very well and didn\u2019t dare continue to talk.\u00b7\u201cZhou Jin and the others aren\u2019t here?\u201d Yu Yao and Mike came over.Old Yu said: \u201cThey were right behind us. Let\u2019s wait a little longer.\u201dIn the end, they waited, and two strangers appeared.One had a round face and despite not being very tall, muscles covered his entire body. He was carrying a sports bag.The other was thinner and was tightly wrapped in his coat. Every now and then he would blow air onto his hands to warm it up.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? There are others?\u201d Yu Wen was surprised.You Huo looked at Qin Jiu.Qin Jiu tilted his head and asked You Huo: \u201cDid anyone say that the examinees for each exam are always fixed?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026..No.\u201dQin Jiu said: \u201cSelecting the same exam doesn\u2019t mean that you would be divided into the same examination centre. For example, invigilators 922 and 152 was also randomly selected to supervise Foreign Language but they are not in this one. What do you think it means?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cIt means that they also don\u2019t want to see you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Wen glanced at Qin Jiu. He was afraid of his brother angering the invigilator.But he was surprised to see Qin Jiu just squinting his eyes and smiling: \u201cWrong. It means that there is a smaller number of people in this exam and only one invigilator is required.\u201d\u201cSmaller number?\u201dYou Huo frowned.\u00b7Sure enough, after waiting for another five minutes next to the thick fog, no one else arrived.Turns out, Zhou Jin and the others were assigned to another examination centre.Although the original group consisted of the five poisons; old, weak, sick, disabled and pregnant, they got along well and at least knew a little about each other.With two new strangers, they once again needed to get to know each other.You cannot tell if this would be a good or bad thing.\u201cFortunately, Old Yu wasn\u2019t lost.\u201d Yu Wen said in fear.\u00b7The two strangers weren\u2019t surprised when they saw their new companions.The round-faced man had his brows furrowed into a frown and he looked a little scary. He nodded at everyone and didn\u2019t speak.The lean and thin one was a little more enthusiastic: \u201cI\u2019m called Chen Bin. I\u2019m from Chongqing. His name is Liang Yuanhao and he\u2019s from Hebei. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dHe turned to ask Liang Yuanhao who glanced at the group and hummed in response.\u201cChongqing? I went there for a few years a long time ago when I was just a rookie soldier so we can be considered as fellow townsmen.\u201d The socially apt Old Yu once again tried to befriend another \u2018fellow townsmen\u201d and he quickly became familiar with Chen Bin.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blog\u201cLiang Yuanhao and I were from the same examination centre and we\u2019re once again together in this one. This can be considered as fate. This is my already my third exam.\u201d Chen Bin said this dejectedly, \u201cI was lucky enough to survive through the first two, but my points are scarily low. The possibility of passing is slim.\u201dOld Yu wanted to comfort him but You Huo suddenly interjected: \u201cDo you know how many points are required to pass?\u201dChen Bin was surprised: \u201cIt\u2019s 60. You guys didn\u2019t know?\u201dOld Yu shook his head: \u201cDon\u2019t know. The perfect score for our last exam seemed to be\u2026\u2026..24? There were also some additional points and deductions that I couldn\u2019t make sense of. In any case, it wasn\u2019t a round number, and I didn\u2019t know what the scores were like for the other subjects so I couldn\u2019t calculate it.\u201dChen Bin asked: \u201cYou guys haven\u2019t met any experienced players?\u201dOld Yu: \u201cNo. In the last exam, everyone was the same. It was our first time.\u201dChen Bin: \u201cOh, that makes sense then. I just happened to meet a brother with experience, and he said that the total scores for each exam will be slightly different but with the five subjects added up, it would be exactly 100 points. If that\u2019s the case, it would be fine getting a total score just over 60.\u201d\u201c60\u2026\u2026.\u201d Old Yu counted with his fingers with a sullen expression.Chen Bin was even more sullen: \u201cI only got 10 points from two subjects. What am I going to do for the remaining three?!\u201dLiang Yuanhao\u2019s expression was stiff. He walked away a little irritably.Chen Bin explained to the others: \u201cHe\u2019s actually not a bad person. It\u2019s just that the total scores from three exams was too abysmal and he\u2019s a little anxious\u2026..\u201dAfterall, this was something that involved life and death. It wasn\u2019t unusual having a bad temper.The others expressed their understanding.Yu Wen pointed to Mike in reassurance: \u201cDon\u2019t worry! Look, we have a secret weapon here! This exam is Foreign Languages and we have a foreigner Mike here!\u201dChen Bin said tactfully: \u201cWe saw. We noticed it the moment we arrived. But I just noticed that this friend here doesn\u2019t seem to be able to speak Chinese? It would be no different to conversing with a duck\u2026\u2026.\u201dYu Wen then pointed at You Huo: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my brother stayed abroad for a while so he can do it too. But\u2026\u2026.he doesn\u2019t like talking much.\u201dChen Bin suddenly came back to life: \u201cThat\u2019s okay. It\u2019s good enough to be able to understand!\u201dEven Liang Yuanhao appeared to have become a little livelier.Mike and You Huo were like calming pills. In an instant, the team relaxed.\u00b7\u201cSo\u2026\u2026..Where are we going now?\u201d The people who were chatting finally started to face the current situation at hand.You Huo expressionlessly pointed to the left.The others only now noticed the bus stop sign standing about three metres away.It was a very simple sign that was supported by a metal pole.Fortunately, the words on it were Chinese. It read \u201cIntercity Bus\u201d and below it was the English translation.As for where this bus was going and where it would be passing, it was a complete mystery. There was no information about this.Just as everyone was confused, a loud horn was heard coming through the snow.A car drove out of the thick fog and it shuddered to a stop at the bus sign.The car was covered in a thick layer of dust. It was so thick, it was difficult making out it\u2019s original colour. The wheels of it were covered in mud. It would be too generous calling it a \u201cbus\u201d. It was more like one of those minivans from the 1990s that shook heavily as it drove.This car?Foreign Language exam?Everyone felt weird and confused.Even the invigilator Qin Jiu\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t very good.Seeing that 001 was unhappy, You Huo was relieved. He carried his backpack and got onto the car first.The inside wasn\u2019t very worn, and the seats were quite neat and tidy.You Huo sat down in the seat by the window in the last row.Seeing Qin Jiu also getting on, he pulled out his phone, fiddled with it and then proceeded to plug white earphones into his ears. He leaned against the window and got ready to sleep.The driver was a dark middle-aged man. He didn\u2019t speak the entire time and they didn\u2019t know whether or not he was a mute.When he saw that they were all on board, he stepped onto the accelerator and set off.\u00b7When You Huo was just about to fall asleep, there was an announcement inside the car.\u3010It is currently 6:30am Beijing Time.\u3011\u3010There are still thirty minutes until the exam officially starts. Please read the exam rules below.\u3011The familiar examination rules were repeated one by one.With the life-saving cheats Mike and You Huo present, everyone\u2019s mood was rather stable. They didn\u2019t tremble as terribly as they did the first time.\u3010If rule violations are made during the exam, you will be kicked out from the examination centre.\u3011\u3010The other examination rules are as per the standard.\u3011Like it was teasing them, the announcement stopped for a moment. When it allowed the listeners digest this information, it slowly spat out the rest of its words.\u3010Because of special circumstances, the exam details will be revealed in advance.\u3011\u3010Examination time: 10 days.\u3011\u3010Subject examined: Foreign Language.\u3011\u3010Foreign language being examined: Gypsy*.\u3011\u3010I wish you all the best.\u3011Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dI beg your pardon???Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: Black WidowPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe radio fell into silence once again after announcing the exam information. The car was silent.What precious calming pill? With \u201cGypsy\u201d here, all that just went up in smoke.Everyone was in daze for a moment. They collapsed lifelessly into their seats.The minivan instantly turned into a hearse carrying several people who were on the brink of death.It was irritating enough alone being awakened from his sleep, and he was even awakened to such terrible news. Just as You Huo was about to sit up, he saw a certain someone come over through the gap between his eyelids.He immediately closed his eyes and pretended to be dead asleep.It was like the minivan was driving through clouds. There was no shaking at all.The sound of footsteps stopped next to him. The headrest You Huo had his head rested against sank down and it was then followed by someone tugging his earphone cord a few times.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dYou Huo expressionlessly pretended to be asleep.The earphone cord was once again tugged a few times. It even made his earlobe and earring move.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dYou Huo continued to pretend to be dead.\u201cThere aren\u2019t any signals here so what\u2019s the point of using earphones? Stop pretending.\u201d A familiar voice that lazily dragged out the words sounded.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dYou Huo could no longer pretend.He half opened his eyes and glanced through the corner of his eyes at the hand that was holding onto the earphone cord: \u201cNeed something?\u201dAfter asking this, he finally raised his eyes and looked at the person standing before him.From his expression to the tone of his voice, he was able to completely express his attitude of 'spit out what you have to say or scram\u201d.Qin Jiu retracted his hand from the earphone cord and leaned against the back of the seat in front of You Huo.He used his chin to point at the seat next to You Huo and said with a smile that was also not quite a smile: \u201cYour bag? I\u2019ll have to trouble you to move it.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t want to.\u201dYou Huo said this expressionlessly and plugged his earphone back in before closing his eyes again.Less than two seconds later, that annoying hand reached over again. It directly pulled out his earphone.The moment those fingers brushed past You Huo\u2019s earlobe, it felt a little ticklish.You Huo raised his hand to pinch his earring and opened his eyes with furrowed brows: \u201cNeed something?\u201d\u201cIf it is really unwilling to move then I\u2019ll have to do it myself.\u201d Qin Jiu smiled and lifted the black bag. He casually assessed its weight and then placed it onto the overhead rack above You Huo.You Huo stared at him: \u201cCan\u2019t you change to another empty seat?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t. There is a total of nine seats in this car and you guys take up seven of them. If I don\u2019t sit here, I\u2019ll have to squeeze in with the driver. I don\u2019t know about you, but the others probably wouldn\u2019t like me doing that.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe didn\u2019t pay attention to the number of seats when he boarded. He didn\u2019t expect the seating to be so limited.Qin Jiu sat down beside him.This person appeared tall and thin in his coat, but you could tell after he got closer that his figure is tall and straight. Through the clothing, you could feel his solid arms and warm body temperature.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogFortunately, there weren\u2019t many seats in the car so there was plenty of space between the front and back rows. Otherwise these two people would have nowhere to put their legs.You Huo wanted to straighten his legs but if he did that, he would kick the seat in front of him.At this moment, it was as if whoever makes way for the other person would be considered the loser. You Huo thought about it and decided that he had nothing to lose. He stretched out and knocked heavily into Qin Jiu\u2019s knee.He pulled up his collar and got ready to close his eyes and sleep again when he heard Qin Jiu mutter quietly: \u201cGypsy. Amazing.\u201dYou Huo opened his eyes: \u201cThis wasn\u2019t your chosen subject?\u201dQin Jiu glanced at him. His fingers lazily forced a small gap between them: \u201cWith you saying that, I feel a bit wronged.\u201dWronged your ass.You Huo stared at him coldly.\u201cLook at that person you picked.\u201d Qin Jiu pointed to where Mike sat, \u201cTo my knowledge, this examinee\u2019s background is very colourful. He\u2019s mixed with four kinds of blood from America, France, Russia and Spain and he ended up looking like that.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSorry, I was a little harsh with my words there.\u201d Qin Jiu didn\u2019t look sorry at all.You Huo: \u201cYou have information on all the examinees?\u201d\u201cYou guess?\u201d Qin Jiu\u2019s voice was low. Even when he dragged out his tone, it sounded nice.You Huo scoffed coldly.Since it was capable of bringing people to this damned place, he believed the examination system should probably be in possession of all their information. So how much do the invigilators know?You Huo recalled their actions earlier and felt that it probably wasn\u2019t much.Invigilators were also bound by rules. Perhaps\u2026\u2026\u2026.if they want to find out about something regarding a specific examinee, they would also need go through some kind of acquisition process? And that acquisition process probably isn\u2019t easy.Otherwise the first one 001, 154 and 922 would investigate would be him.Qin Jiu supported his head and stared at him for a while with his pitch-black eyes: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. In general, I have no interest in an examinee\u2019s information.\u201dYou Huo very perfunctorily \u2018oh\u2019ed.\u201cIn short, with a treasure like this in the team, it isn\u2019t surprising for you all to be sent to this damned place.\u201d Qin Jiu said.You Huo didn\u2019t know what exactly was behind the so-called examination system but he felt that it had a weird temper. In order to avoid this group of people getting their \u201cmother-tongue\u201d, it had gone through twists and turns to pull out something like \u201cGypsy\u201d.Since he had found out the reason behind it, he no longer placed the blame on Qin Jiu.And he didn\u2019t know if it was just his imagination but, ever since they got onto the car, Qin Jiu appeared to be a little unhappy.You Huo looked at the invigilator who was lost in thought with his eyes lowered.Perhaps it was because the reflections of the snow outside was too bright, his eyes started to hurt again. It felt a little uncomfortable.He rubbed it a few times before putting his earphones back in and going back to sleep.\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u00b7After about ten minutes, the car suddenly shook.The distressed examines were alarmed by this and quickly saw that the scenery outside had changed.The sky covered in fog and snow was gone and what appeared before them was a winding mountain road.The road conditions were not good, so the car shook endlessly as it travelled along it. There was solid mud and gravel everywhere.This road was very narrow. If two cars met on either end, they would have to shift to first gear and inch past slowly.The vegetation by the mountain road grew so densely together, it was difficult making out how far down it went. Once you fall, it is very likely for the body to go missing forever.Like this, the minivan drove daringly along it.Halfway through, the driver twisted the radio knob. The radio inside the car buzzed a few times and jumped to a certain frequency before starting to play old songs. Occasionally, it was interrupted by traffic reminders which warned drivers to avoid certain roads which have become blocked due to recent landslides.During the broadcast, a warning sign appeared before the car.In front of the warning sign was a large rock and a fallen tree. A normal car clearly wouldn\u2019t be able to pass through.But the driver ignored the warning completely and swerved the car around in large movements.Everyone in the car was startled. When they fell back into their seats, the car had already passed through the landslide and it continued to drive deeper into the mountains.\u00b7Since entering the depths of the mountains, the sky had darkened.There clearly was heating in the car but everyone still unconsciously shivered.When they came out of the mountain road, they were met with an old street sign by the side of the road. It was marked with the road number.Old Yu wrapped himself tightly with his clothes and shrank in his head. Seeing that number, he muttered: \u201cThis road seems to be close to the border\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re really crossing it?\u201dOld Yu: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dYu Wen shrank his neck and stared anxiously outside the window: \u201cWe can\u2019t just randomly cross the border!\u201dAs he said that, the minivan made a big turn and it entered the woods on the side.Everyone was bewildered by strange route. They wanted to ask but the driver was a mute.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogAnother ten minutes passed.The car got out from the woods and it braked sharply by a dirt road.\u00b7\u201cBrother wake up. We\u2019re getting off.\u201d Yu Wen had one knee up on his seat and he reached over the back of the chair to wake You Huo up.He really was in awe of his brother\u2019s bravery. He was actually able to sleep so deeply.You Huo rubbed his hair and half opened his eyes. He glanced next to him through half-open eyes. The seat was already empty.With the lower half of his face covered by his collar, he said in a muffled voice: \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Yu Wen didn\u2019t hear.You Huo shook his head to wake himself up.He stood up and stomped on his numb leg before bending down and looking out the window: \u201cWhere is this?\u201dThis time Yu Wen heard him, \u201cDon\u2019t know. The driver stopped the car here and ran.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean ran?\u201dYu Wen pointed out the window: \u201cThere. He ran down that dirt road.\u201dThey appeared to have stopped at the entrance to a village. Through the trees, they could faintly see several roofs in the distance. Apart from the road leading down to the village, there was nowhere else for them to go.They were surrounded by an endless sea of trees.Yu Wen followed behind You Huo and got off the car.Outside the car, the examinees looked at each other dumbly.Invigilator Qin Jiu on the other hand stood by the woods. He had one hand supporting a tree and was looking somewhere into the distance.\u201cOld Yu mentioned earlier that the road was near the border. Are we in some particular location in reality?\u201d Yu Wen asked You Huo.The newly joined Chen Bin interjected: \u201cFrom my experience, it probably isn\u2019t. But you will probably see things later that resemble those in reality or things that you have seen before.\u201dYu Wen: \u201cIf we\u2019re not in a place in reality then that so-called death, is it really death?\u201dChen Bin smiled bitterly: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Only those who tried it will know but who would dare try something like that?\u201dYu Wen lowered his head and said: \u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026\u2026..\u201dYou Huo couldn\u2019t care less about this topic. After getting off, he circled around the area.Soon, he kicked somewhere and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a stone monument here.\u201d\u201cI was looking for that. Turns out it\u2019s here.\u201d Chen Bin was experienced. After getting off, he had been looking for information.He came over and crouched before the stone monument. He pulled away some of the weeds: \u201cIt probably says the name of this place. Although it may not be useful, it\u2019s a little reassuring when you know where we are\u2026\u2026\u201dThe others heard this and moved over.All they saw was a worn-out stone monument engraved with strange characters.\u201cWhat are those drawings?\u201d\u201cProbably letters\u2026..\u201dChen Bin took out a tissue from his bag and wiped off the parts that were stained with mud. It was still difficult to decipher.Yu Wen: \u201cK\u2026\u2026.is this a?\u201dChen Bin: \u201cLo\u2026.. What the hell is this?\u201d\u201cProbably p.\u201d Yu Yao supported her stomach and tilted her head to read: \u201cThat one looks like h\u2026\u2026u\u2026\u2026v.\u201dPutting aside the miscellaneous and useless parts, the name of the location that was carved onto this monument was:Kalo PhuvEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat the hell is that?Let me tell you a joke. You can tell where you are just by looking at the sign.\u00b7While everyone was in despair, the silent driver came back. He brought along a middle-aged man dressed in a military coat and leather cap.Looking at his face, he was probably a Chinese national.The driver said: \u201cThere, these people.\u201dOld Yu was surprised: \u201cYou can talk?!\u201dThe driver glanced at him and said hoarsely: \u201cHe will take you to that house. Remember, don\u2019t go in the woods.When he was done, he waved his hand at the man with the leather hat, went back onto the minivan and drove away.The car twisted and turned into the woods and, in a blink of an eye, it was blocked by the crooked branches and it disappeared from their sights.Even the sounds of its engine and the grinding of the tires against the gravel disappeared.The woods became eerily quiet. It made everyone\u2019s hair rise.\u00b7\u201cWhat did we come here for?\u201d You Huo asked the man with the leather hat.The man in the leather hat made a sound of exclamation and said: \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you were looking for the black widow? Why? Did you already forget?\u201d\u201cBlack widow? Who\u2019s the black widow?\u201d Chen Bin followed over and asked.The man in the leather hat cowered. He tightened his hat around his neck and said with a muffled voice: \u201cAn old granny. She and her old man came here during the war and stayed behind. Seems to be Gypsies. In any case\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe wrapped himself even tightened and said with a whisper: \u201cI\u2019ll take you there. You should be careful. After she came, our entire village had become strange. What made you to want to\u2026\u2026\u2026stay here for ten days?\u201dEveryone wanted to cry without tears. Inside they said: Do you think I\u2019m crazy? Why would I want to stay here?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: Allocating RoomsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe man in the leather hat who led the way was the village chief. He called this place \u201cChars Village\u201d and there was a total of eighteen households.The village was located close to the border. During the war, the black widow came over with several other Russians and they decided to stay.The stone monument was engraved by her but even the village chief didn\u2019t know the meaning behind those words.The crowd followed him along the dirt road towards the village.To one side of the road was a river covered with a thick layer of ice. On the other side were houses. They were all concrete houses and some still retained traces of brickwork but, no matter what it was made of, their roofs were of the exact same dark red colour.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say eighteen households?\u201d Yu Wen muttered quietly, \u201cJust these houses alone look like there\u2019s more than eighteen?\u201dThe village chief continued to walk ahead while wrapped tightly in his military coat. It was as if he didn\u2019t hear him.\u201cHey, don\u2019t walk so fast. We\u2019re asking you a question old brother!\u201d Even at a time like this Old Yu didn\u2019t forget to refer to him politely.The village chief was startled by his pat on the back. He stopped his steps and mumbled incoherently: \u201cIn the past there were certainly more than eighteen. Some died, some left and gradually there are only a few of us left.\u201dHe raised his hand and pointed at two of them: \u201cLike that one, and that one there. You can tell in one glance that it isn\u2019t being used.\u201dOld Yu was about to nod when You Huo interjected: \u201cCan\u2019t tell. To me it looks like all those houses are uninhabited.\u201dThe village chief was surprised: \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cToo quiet.\u201dAs soon as he said that, everyone\u2019s footsteps stopped.With the sound of footsteps ceasing, the strange silence became even more obvious.It really was too quiet.Despite clearly being early in the morning, there wasn\u2019t even a sound of people talking. There was no collisions between pots and pans or the sound of doors opening and closing\u2026\u2026..There was nothing.Everyone felt goosebumps forming. They all looked warily over at the village chief.A hint of fear could be sensed from the village chief. After hesitating for a moment, he let out a long sigh: \u201cThere really are people living there. It\u2019s just\u2026\u2026\u2026.Everyone is too afraid to go out. They would usually try to sleep as long as they can.\u201d\u201cToo afraid to go out? Why?\u201dPlease support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogThe village chief glanced carefully into the distance.Everyone\u2019s eyes followed. On the other side of the river were several low houses of a very different style. It was grey and inconspicuous, and even the roof was black allowing it to almost blend in with the woods behind it.The village chief appeared to be afraid of being overhead by someone and he whispered quietly: \u201cIt\u2019s not safe at night. If you stay here please remember not to go out at night. Even if you hear something, don\u2019t open the door.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Everyone was scared and confused.But the village chief no longer dared to speak. He quickly waved his hand and continued to lead the way with his head tucked in his clothes.Everyone was confused, but they also didn\u2019t dare ask any further.\u00b7\u201cShit!\u201dOn the way, Yu Wen suddenly cried out in alarm. He grabbed You Huo and said: \u201cBrother, look at that house.\u201dYou Huo looked over. The others who heard him also looked over.On the second floor of one of the houses stood a person. That person hid behind the curtain and watched them silently.\u201cSuddenly saw a face by the window. Scared me to death!\u201d Yu Wen rubbed his chest and grumbled.Soon they realised that it wasn\u2019t just this one.In several of the houses, there were people quietly peeking out past behind the curtains.The village chief said: \u201cSince there are guests here, they are also very curious. They\u2019re just too scared to come out.\u201d\u201cThen do they stay inside the whole time?\u201d Yu Wen asked with surprise: \u201cWhat do they do if they\u2019re hungry? They don\u2019t eat or drink?\u201d\u201cWe all have cellars here and they are used to store food. There are ladders that lead down there.\u201d The village chief explained, \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t go out at all. Usually they would come out and do some things in the afternoon or evening, but they will all return home before dark.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d\u201cIs it related to the black widow?\u201d You Huo asked.The village chief was silent for a moment. He then nodded and said quietly: \u201cI heard you\u2019re here to work for her?\u201dPlease read this from kk translates\u201cWork? What work?\u201dHearing something related to their task, everyone perked up their ears.\u201cWork with the dead!\u201d The village chief himself was frightened. He suppressed his voice and continued fearfully: \u201cThat black widow likes to deal with the dead. Like sewing up severed body parts together.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dVillage chief: \u201cIf anyone is missing, you find her to see if they\u2019re dead and find out where they had died.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe village chief appeared to become even more engrossed when he saw that they were scared: \u201cSometimes she would go out and personally get the parts.\u201d\u201cFor example, a few years ago\u2026\u2026..\u201d The village chief pointed at the frozen river: \u201cA woman drifted down that river. The black widow dragged her out using a large basket and lugged her home.\u201dDrifted? Lugged?This man was good with his words. It made the listeners trembled fearfully.Several of the men retched. Yu Yao\u2019s legs were soft.Only You Huo didn\u2019t react: \u201cSince she deals with the dead, why are you living humans afraid?\u201dThe village chief clasped his hand and shook his head sullenly: \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. Sigh\u2026..You\u2019ll know after staying a night.\u201d\u00b7Soon, the village chief led them to the end of the frozen river. They stepped onto the thick ice and went over to the other side.Several grey houses appeared before them.As they got closer, they saw that these houses were made from stone and the exterior walls were uneven. The grey stone surface was painted messily with white paint. A worn-out mat sat in front of the door and dried branches hung next to it.One of the houses looked a little different. There was even an old crystal ball by the windowsill and some \u2026\u2026eerily white things that looked like finger bones.Before they even entered the house, they smelt strong incense. It was so strong, it made them a little dizzy.The village chief wanted to stay as far as possible from the house.\u201cThis is the black widow\u2019s place.\u201d He glanced over and asked: \u201cWhat time is it now?\u201dEveryone flipped out their phones only to see that the time displayed on their screens was 23:13 at night. It clearly wasn\u2019t the right time.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogWhile they were in confusion, a low voice sounded: \u201c6:55.\u201dEveryone turned over. The person who spoke was Qin Jiu.He waved his phone and said: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just a bit more accurate than yours.\u201dChen Bin was surprised: \u201cThis handsome guy is amazing! The season and time in every exam are different compared to reality so how did you get it to match?\u201dQin Jiu placed his phone back into his pocket and said lazily: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m an invigilator.\u201dChen Bin let out an \u201coh\u201d as he rearranged his bag.Two seconds later, his hand slipped, and his bag fell to the ground.\u201cYou\u2019re what???\u201dQin Jiu ignored him. He pulled out a card from his pocket, tilted his head and asked You Huo next to him: \u201cDoes this count as helping you?\u201dThe card was the card You Huo drew earlier called \u3010Invigilators Help\u3011.You Huo took the card, turned it around and brought it right in front of Qin Jiu\u2019s nose: \u201cPlease read it properly. It says here \u2018extra help\u2019. Do you know what extra means?\u201dQin Jiu revealed a smile that was also not quite like a smile: \u201cNot sure.\u201dSmile your ass.You Huo: \u201cGo check a dictionary.\u201dAn examinee didn\u2019t wear a watch and asked the invigilator for the time. Would this be considered as extra help? Of course not. It\u2019s the same as getting an invigilator to follow you to the bathroom. It was only part of their job.The card naturally didn\u2019t get used. Qin Jiu let out a \u201cwhat a pity\u201d before storing the card back inside his pocket.The village chief blinked blankly for a while before returning to his senses. He reminded the others: \u201cThe black widow would wake up at 7:30 every morning. She won\u2019t open the door before then so I\u2019ll take you around and get you familiarised with this place first.\u201d\u00b7In addition to the one the black widow stayed in, the remaining four houses were empty.Every one of them were small and filled with old knitted blankets. There was only a single bedroom in each house that was furnished with a bed that looked a little like a tent.The village chief said: \u201cI\u2019ll have to trouble you all to squeeze in.\u201dNaturally, the newly joined Chen Bin and Liang Yuanhao stayed in the same house. Since Yu Yao was a girl, it wasn\u2019t convenient for her to stay with the others, so she got a separate one alone.The remaining people were Yu Wen, Old Yu, Mike, You Huo and Qin Jiu. They would need to share the two remaining houses.You Huo thought for a moment and asked Qin Jiu: \u201cIs there a small western building you invigilators use here?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cThanks to you, full-time onsite surveillance. There\u2019s no small western building for me to stay. I need to squeeze into this narrow, confined and dirty place instead.\u201dYou Huo pretended not to hear him. He looked at the village chief sternly and said: \u201cYou decide.\u201dYu Wen said: \u201cWhy don\u2019t I, Old Yu and my brother squeeze together. We\u2019re a family anyway!\u201dMike glanced at Qin Jiu and was very reluctant.Everyone was afraid of the invigilator. No matter how you looked at it\u2026\u2026\u2026The only exception was You Huo.\u00b7Two minutes later, everyone carefully watched You Huo and Qin Jiu walk into the house.Just as they were about to sit down, a familiar voice suddenly sounded in the room.\u3010It is currently 7:00 Beijing time. The exam has officially begun.\u3011\u3010The first exam: Listening.\u3011\u3010The audio for the exam will be played in thirty minutes. It will only be played twice. Please listen and answer the questions carefully.\u3011\u3010In addition, examinees and invigilators are prohibited from developing improper relationships. Please reassign the rooms.\u3011Everyone: \u201c???\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dLooks like the system doesn\u2019t want to live anymore.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was neither inside nor outside.Because the air around the two great masters in the room was a bit scary\u2026..Please read this from kk translatesYou Huo glanced at Qin Jiu and then looked away expressionlessly.With an expression that looked like he was at a funeral, he looked around the room before finally finding the source of the sound.It was a crow specimen that stood rigidly on a copper frame. It had its wings spread and its beak wide open.Ten seconds ago when they first entered through the door, the beak was still closed.You Huo didn\u2019t even bend and just looked at the crow with narrowed eyes: \u201cWho\u2019s operating this examination system? Who set up those idiotic words? Is there a place to file a complaint?\u201dCrow: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dYou Huo turned to look at Qin Jiu.A \u201cbeep\u201d went off from Qin Jiu\u2019s wrist and it was followed by a red glow.He rubbed his wrist and winked at You Huo: \u201cA friendly reminder not to ask things you\u2019re not supposed to. The first time is to warn me not to leak any information out. If you ask again, you will be kicked out of this exam.\u201dYou Huo patted the crow\u2019s head.Crow: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dQin Jiu\u2019s eyes were dark. It stopped at You Huo for a moment before turning to look at the crow.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s change rooms. Then I\u2019ll stay with that mixed examinee.\u201d He stared at the crow and said this.This time the crow was silent for two seconds.Just as everyone thought that the problem was settled, it suddenly spoke up and repeated the words from earlier:\u3010Examinees and invigilators are prohibited from developing improper relationships. Please reassign the rooms.\u3011In order to accommodate Mike, it even repeated that in English.Mike: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cThen with this one here?\u201d Qin Jiu casually pointed at Yu Wen.\u3010Examinees and invigilators are prohibited from developing improper relationships. Please reassign the rooms.\u3011\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone finally came to a realisation as the warning was announced once again. It probably wasn\u2019t directed at just Qin Jiu and You Huo. It applied to everyone else as well.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogYu Wen quietly nudged his father: \u201cDid this system get triggered by something? Why is it so sensitive\u2026\u2026\u2026. If sharing the same room is being improper then does that mean you\u2019ll have children by just sharing a bed?\u201dOld Yu: \u201cDon\u2019t speak so carelessly!\u201dYu Wen: \u201c???\u201d\u00b7Qin Jiu also walked over to the crow. He said: \u201cThen we can just forget about full-time onsite surveillance and let this examinee do as he pleases.\u201dBeep\u2014\u2014\u2014-A violation warning.Mr. Invigilator 001 scoffed.Can\u2019t stay in the same room yet still needing full-time onsite surveillance.Can you speak some sense?\u00b7Qin Jiu rubbed his wrist and looked at the crow.At that moment, everyone could clearly feel the air in the room become tense.He looked like he was about to do something but after a moment he just spoke slowly: \u201cHow about this? The examinee stays in the bedroom and I\u2019ll bear with it for a while and just use the sofa.\u201dThis time the crow didn\u2019t say anything. It appeared to have silently accepted this compromise.The onlookers let out a sigh of relief.You Huo looked at Qin Jiu strangely.Although he didn\u2019t get along with this invigilator, he had to admit that Qin Jiu had a special temperament. It was as if those iron-clad rules could not tie him down.Even if invigilator 001 stood there with a smile while negotiating with the examination system in a casual tone, it gave people a feeling that\u2026\u2026.He would break the rules at any moment.His concessions and compromises were like a lion lazily taking a break. It wasn\u2019t without any hint of aggression.It was like a sleepy lion asking for a kiss. Who would dare let it kiss?\u00b7The issue of accommodation was finally resolved.After going around in a big circle, the eventual room allocation was no different from the allocation at the beginning.The only addition was annoyance.The houses were all decorated very similarly, and the same crow specimen stood on a stand in all the rooms.It was the system\u2019s speaker and was used to convey information. Except for You Huo and Qin Jiu who touched its head, no one else dared to touch it.\u00b7Soon, it was 7:30.Everyone heard creaking sounds coming from inside the main house.The door opened. The black widow was finally awake.The crow spoke:\u3010The listening exam officially starts now. All examinees please hurry to the test centre. Each passage will only be played twice.\u3011As soon as the black widow woke up, the village chief hurried away like a mouse running away from a cat.Before he slipped away, he said to them: \u201cThe black widow has a custom. Before you enter, you must draw a card.\u201dCard drawing again?You Huo\u2018s expression immediately darkened.\u201cWhat card? Playing cards or the tarot cards girls play with?\u201d Yu Wen surprisingly didn\u2019t completely waste his time away at school and actually knew a little about it, \u201cWill she give us a divination after drawing the card?\u201d\u201cIf she did, would you understand?\u201d Old Yu interjected with annoyance.\u201cThat\u2019s true. Then what\u2019s the point of drawing a card?\u201dThe village chief opened his mouth but stopped himself. He eventually said: \u201cIt represents whether you would be able to sleep peacefully tonight.\u201dHe probably could guess what they were about to say so he quickly added: \u201cDon\u2019t think about escaping. You will have to draw a card, or the consequences will be even more terrible.\u201dThe village chief appeared to have recalled something and he started to tremble again.\u201cIn any case, just remember not to anger her!\u201dHe left behind this sentence and quickly ran away.Wrapped in his military coat, he hurried across the frozen river and hid inside one of the houses on the other side.In an instant, the entire village was silent again. The other side of the river and the side they stood on looked like two different worlds.\u00b7With experience from the previous exam, everyone didn\u2019t dare delay things any longer. They quickly came over to the black widow\u2019s house.A small and thin, vulture like old lady waited at the door. Her face looked like the bark of an old tree and it was covered in deep furrows but her eyes where bright, like those of a child.This contrast gave people a strange sense of unease.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogHer head was wrapped in a complicatedly patterned headscarf while both her arms were covered in clanging bracelets.Those bracelets appeared to be quite heavy and it was difficult for her to even raise her hand.The black widow\u2019s eyes stared at the crowd for a few seconds. She then suddenly laughed, revealing her sharp and pointed teeth. Those who saw it couldn\u2019t help but shudder.She muttered something and then proceeded to spread out a stack of cards on front of the crowd. She gestured with her mouth at Old Yu who stood at the front.\u201cI, I pick?\u201d Old Yu couldn\u2019t help but panic.The black widow again pushed the cards closer to him.Old Yu glanced at the crowd and hesitantly picked one out.The black widow turned it around. When the others saw the card, they all gasped.Although the words on the card were incomprehensible, the figure standing on a stone pillar while holding a scythe was something that they were all familiar with.Yu Wen said softly: \u201cFuck\u2026\u2026.Is that the grim reaper? I don\u2019t remember what kind of cards there were but I think there was a grim reaper\u2026\u2026..\u201dCold sweat covered the backs of everyone present.The black widow again laughed. Her laughter was dainty, like those of a young woman.At this moment, the door she held started to let out scratching sounds.It sounded like a nail scratching across it\u2026\u2026..Everyone who had gone through an exam couldn\u2019t be more familiar with this sound.Sure enough, in the blink of an eye, an examination question appeared on the door.Please read this from kk translatesListening question: Please listen to the following audio segment and answer the following questions.(1) What is the black widow\u2019s name?(2) Where is the black widow\u2019s family? Please find them.(3) How many people are in the black widow\u2019s house?Exam requirements: The answers will be collected every morning at 7:30 in the morning. If you don\u2019t earn any points, an examinee would be randomly selected and sent into a coffin.Coffin\u2026\u2026.What coffin???The moment the question appeared, the black widow opened her mouth, revealing her sharp teeth\u2026\u2026\u2026.She then said a long garbled code.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dEight faces of confusion.Scratching once again came from the door.Another line appeared below the question: The audio has been played once. It will now be played again. Please listen carefully.The black widow opened her mouth again. Suddenly a hand stretched over, and it stuffed a rag into her mouth.In an instant the black widow\u2019s mouth was blocked.You Huo\u2019s voice sounded: \u201cSorry about that. Please wait a bit.\u201dEveryone: \u201c???\u201dThe newly joined Chen Bin and Liang Yuanhao were stunned\u2026\u2026\u2026.You could fucking do something like that?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The pattern was complex, and it was even scented. It smelt a little like the incense coming from the black widow\u2019s house.Everyone reassured themselves: At least it wasn\u2019t a smell the black widow hated, right?But\u2026\u2026\u2026.Was it really okay doing something like this?Wouldn\u2019t it anger the black widow???Before the village chief left, he even emphasised strongly to avoid angering the black widow at all costs\u2026\u2026\u2026. It has only been a few minutes since then?\u201cIt looks like you can\u2019t last a single day without breaking the rules.\u201d Qin Jiu who was forced to become a personal invigilator spoke.You Huo: \u201cDid the examination requirements earlier specify that we couldn\u2019t stop the audio from playing?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cIt indeed didn\u2019t.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cDid it say that I couldn\u2019t block the subject\u2019s mouth?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cIt also didn\u2019t.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cThen how did I break the rules?\u201dQin Jiu seemed to find it quite amusing. He made a \u2018go ahead\u2019 gesture and indicated for You Huo to continue. He probably wanted to see what else he was going to do.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogHe then saw You Huo take out his phone from his jeans pocket. He opened the recording function and then removed the rag from the black widow\u2019s mouth: \u201cContinue.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dBlack widow: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh yeah! We can use our phones!\u201dEveryone soon understood. They were not forced to turn off their phones for this exam. A few minutes ago, they had even used their phone to check the time, but no one realised that they could use it to record.You Huo\u2019s actions reminded everyone that they could do this.In an instant, everyone pulled out their phones. Seven examinees with their seven phones, they were all pointed at the black widow.Two seconds later, Mr. invigilator 001 also pulled out his phone.The newly joined Chen Bin finally reacted: \u201cIs it really okay like this? Won\u2019t she get angry?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cIt\u2019s too late now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe two newcomers suddenly felt like they had just boarded a pirate ship.The kind you can no longer get off from.Chen Bin tremblingly held his phone for a long time, but he saw that the black widow was only staring at You Huo.It was as if no one else mattered and that the first person to provoke her was the key culprit.The pupils of the black widow\u2019s eyes were very large making it look even more dark and deep. It was okay when it was moving around but, once fixed, it looked like the eyes of the dead.Whoever those eyes stared at, they would experience terrible fear.But You Huo didn\u2019t care.The black widow looked at him, but he only looked down and fiddled with his phone. He saved the recording from earlier.He was so calm, everyone else felt a little too embarrassed to panic.\u00b7You Huo saved the recording and changed the name to \u201cbunch of nonsense\u201d before asking the black widow: \u201cIs there anything else?\u201dThe black widow stared expressionlessly at You Huo for a long time before cackling again. It was as if the gagging and the recording just now wasn\u2019t important or perhaps\u2026\u2026\u2026.she had decided to settle the debt later.The black widow\u2019s thin claws\u2026\u2026fingers grabbed You Huo\u2019s wrist and she pulled him in through the door.She then tilted her head and looked at the others.The other examinees were not so courageous. When looked at, they immediately entered the house without needing any further prompts.The black widow nodded with satisfaction.Please read this from kk translatesLiang Yuanhao was at the end of the group. Just as he stepped over, the door behind him creaked shut and the lock clicked. It was as if there was something following closely behind him.Every looked at the closed door and suddenly recalled the last question: How many people are there in the black widow\u2019s house\u2026\u2026..Their faces all turned pale and they quickly huddled together. No one dared to separate from the group.\u00b7The black widow\u2019s house was more spacious than expected.It was said that no matter were Gypsies lived, they would keep the customs of their ancestors. Every room was arranged so that it looked like a tent canopy and numerous felt and carpet was scattered around.The scent in the room was even stronger causing people to feel a little dizzy.Sitting on the windowsills and the stovetop were worn-out teacups, teaspoons and trays. There was a jar of something dark sitting on the wooden table.You Huo leaned down and smelt it. It was tea but it also carried a faint tobacco scent.It wasn\u2019t a good smell, but it was better than the suffocating aroma in the room.The only invigilator present was also very impolite. After entering, he picked out a single seated sofa and sat down.In the house, there were two bamboo baskets sitting by the hearth. It contained balls of wool and both long and short needles.The black widow reached in. The bracelets on her arms clanged together causing her hand to sink further down from the weight.She pulled out a few woollen dolls out from the bamboo basket.Those dolls were not very good-looking. Its face, hands and feet were all made with old, greying fabric and the limbs were bulging awkwardly from the cotton stuffing. It was then stitched together with thick wool.One of it was already completed. The black widow placed it in her apron. The others were semi-complete products. Some were missing limbs while others were missing heads.Looking at it, you couldn\u2019t help but feel that they were dolls used for divination or cursing.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogThe black widow pointed at the wooden frame in the corner of the room and muttered another bunch of garbled code.This time everyone was experienced. They had not turned off the recording since entering the house so it was naturally recorded down.\u00b7You Huo looked at the wooden frame and saw several completed dolls sitting side by side.The black widow placed the one in her apron there as well. She then shoved wool and needles into everyone\u2019s hands.She pointed at the bamboo basket and said: \u201c# \uffe5 * & \u2026 (&%\u201dEven if it was spoken in Gypsy language, everyone could understand what she was saying \u2014\u2014 She wanted them to finish the rest of the dolls.The black widow took out an hourglass and turned it around before placing it onto the wooden table. She then got up and left.As soon as she went out, there was a rattling sound coming from outside.Chen Bin responded quickly. He rushed over to the window and pulled at it a few times before saying: \u201cThey\u2019re all locked\u2026\u2026\u2026She locked us in. What should we do?\u201dYu Wen pointed at the bamboo basket with his lips: \u201cThe meaning is obvious. The hourglass was also set. We will either be released once the sand runs out or we need to finish making these dolls before the sand runs out.\u201dEveryone looked at each other. They then hesitantly sat cross-legged on the floor. Each picked up an unfinished doll and was in daze.Old Yu sighed and said: \u201cWhat else can we do? Let\u2019s sew. Since the black widow is the subject this time, we should do as she says. If there\u2019s anything, we can just wait until the sand in the hourglass runs out first, right?\u201dThey now subconsciously regarded You Huo has the leader. After saying something, they would always check with You Huo.But when he turned around, he saw that his nephew wasn\u2019t sitting down and was standing by the bed, looking out the window.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Everyone was nervous.\u201cNothing.\u201d You Huo answered.He just wanted to see where the black widow was going.\u00b7Outside the window you could see the black widow\u2019s hunched figure.With the blink of an eye, she had already gone very far. Soon, she disappeared into the dark woods.You Huo lowered the curtain.He had originally wanted to sit next to the hearth, but he stopped his steps.At the very bottom of the wooden frame was a doll sitting in the corner. It had gathered a layer of dust and was very inconspicuous, but its leg drew You Huo\u2019s attention.He walked over and bent down to pick the doll up.Looking at the material and the amount of dust gathered, this doll was probably made a long time ago. Its workmanship was sloppy and the limbs that were connected to the body were all skewed. The arms and legs were also not the same colour.This made the doll look strange and pitiful.But this wasn\u2019t the reason why You Huos\u2019 attention was drawn.He noticed it because there was a pattern on one of its legs.The doll was crudely made but the pattern looked very realistic. It looked like the tattoo on the ankle of a living person. The tattoo just happened to be a small bellflower.You Huo stared at the tattoo for a few seconds. He then reached out to pat the person sitting on the sofa.Qin Jiu had been supporting his head watching him. When he was patted, he lazily spoke up: \u201cSpeak.\u201dYou Huo passed the doll\u2019s leg over to him: \u201cLook familiar? I have facial blindness. Not sure if I remembered correctly.\u201dQin Jiu looked at the pattern: \u201cShould it be familiar?\u201dYou Huo snorted impatiently: \u201cThat thing I cleaned out from the confinement room last time\u2026\u2026..The one I left in the bucket in front of your door. It seemed to have this too.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dYou still have the nerve to mention that???Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It should be eye-catching. You didn\u2019t see?\u201dQin Jiu laughed exasperatedly: \u201cYou did that to deliberately disgust me yet you expect me to look at it carefully?\u201dHe fiddled with the dolls leg and looked at the tattoo again: \u201cBesides\u2026\u2026..If I answered you honestly, would that be counted as extra help?\u201dYou Huo took away the doll: \u201cIf you can\u2019t remember, forget it.\u201d\u00b7The others had not been in the confinement room, so they didn\u2019t know what kind of riddle they were talking about. They didn\u2019t dare interrupt.As an alcoholic, Old Yu\u2019s hands trembled terribly.He picked up a thick needle and tried to thread it again and again. Five minutes passed and he was still unsuccessful.Yu Wen watched him and finally couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He grabbed it over.\u201cDrink, drink, drink. Now look at yourself! You can no longer keep your hands and feet steady. You did this to yourself.\u201dHe muttered this as he helped his father thread the needle before throwing it back.The others also threaded theirs and got ready to sew.Only Yu Yao remained sitting there in daze. She whispered: \u201cI find these dolls a little strange. I\u2019m scared. Can I not sew?\u201dHe voice was too quiet. It almost disappeared before it left her throat.The only person who heard it was Old Yu who sat closest to her.Old Yu hesitated for a moment. He wanted to reassure her.He then heard You Huo said: \u201cWait.\u201dHe said it too suddenly and everyone was startled. They quickly stopped and looked at him blankly.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is something wrong?\u201d Chen Bin asked.You Huo walked over to the bamboo basket and bent over.He pulled out a few arms, legs and heads before throwing it back in.\u201cDon\u2019t sew.\u201d He patted off the dust from his hand.\u201cWhy?\u201d Liang Yuanhao who had not spoken much couldn\u2019t help but ask.You Huo pointed at the bamboo basket: \u201cThe fabric in here are almost the same and all are grey but those that are completed on the wooden frame have very different coloured arms and legs.\u201dLian Yuanhao frowned: \u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cNothing. Just felt it\u2019s strange.\u201d You Huo straightened up.Chen Bin could tell that these examinees all listened to You Huo\u2019s words.He held Liang Yuanhao back and smiled awkwardly at You Huo: \u201cThat colour\u2026\u2026.indeed is a little strange but the black widow asked us to sew it. If we didn\u2019t are you certain nothing will happen?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cNot certain.\u201dChen Bin: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dPlease support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogLiang Yuanhao still wanted to say something, but Chen Bin grabbed him and shook his head.\u201cHow can you be 100% certain about anything? It\u2019s up to you whether you want to listen.\u201d You Huo originally didn\u2019t have much patience. The old witch\u2019s nonsense language was already annoying enough.After he said that, he dragged a chair over to the hearth and silently started to warm himself up with the fire.\u201cBrother\u2026\u2026..You\u2019re really not sewing?\u201d Yu Wen held the doll and asked him carefully.You Huo supported his chin and let out an \u201cEn\u201d.\u201cOkay then. I\u2026..I won\u2019t sew it either.\u201d Yu Wen hesitated and eventually placed the doll back into the bamboo basket.The others who had experienced the first exam also dropped the doll in their hands.It was actually a very uncertain decision.But in a world like this, nothing was certain, and everything involved gambling with their lives.It was just that You Huo made this gamble in an extraordinarily calm manner.He was like an exceptional risk taker. Despite the cold exterior, inside he was both wild and crazy.This kind of risky choice convinced the others, but it was difficult to convince Chen Bin and Liang Yuanhao.Especially after experiencing three exams and still having a very low score, Liang Yuanhao was under immense pressure. He looked at everyone with suspicion.He had not experienced the last exam together, so he didn\u2019t know about the team\u2019s score and he also didn\u2019t witness You Huo\u2019s performance.From his perspective, You Huo had just been testing the limits of the rules ever since the exam started. Every move of his challenged the bottom line of the examination system consequently provoking the unknown.He really couldn\u2019t understand this behaviour\u2026\u2026\u2026..Can\u2019t he just be a little obedient?Why did he have to go against those terrible things?Wasn\u2019t it better to live a little longer?Please read this from kk translatesHe said indignantly: \u201cUp to you.\u201dAfter successfully going through near-death experiences, he no longer knew what to do. He however decided to go against You Huo and honestly did as the black widow requested.As he said that, he picked up a doll\u2019s leg and sewed it.Thick wool passed through the fabric making a rustling sound.Chen Bin looked at him and then he looked at You Huo. He felt very conflicted.\u00b7The hourglass emptied very quickly and it soon became empty.Liang Yunhuo was clumsy with his hands so he could only sew on two legs.In the end Chen Bin also decided to follow the black widow\u2019s request but he had hesitated for too long, so he only managed to half sew on an arm.There was a click.The door to the house opened and the black widow entered the house with a hunched back/She tilted her head and glanced at the room. She then walked slowly over to Liang Yuanhao and Chen Bin.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blog\u201cHm\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d The black widow picked up the doll and frowned. She appeared dissatisfied.Liang Yuanhao\u2019s face turned pale. He muttered in contempt: \u201cIt\u2019s all because we wasted time on those useless things. If not, I would have definitely finished\u2026\u2026\u201dThe black widow then looked at the others only to see that they were all empty-handed. Her face instantly darkened.The group watched her fearfully, afraid that she would suddenly explode.What they didn\u2019t expect was that she would lick her lips and smile again.She placed the dolls in the bamboo basket and gathered them up. She said a series of incomprehensible words before kicking them out.\u00b7The moment the door closed, the crow\u2019s voice sounded:\u3010The audio for the listening test is over. You will be given enough time to think about your answer.\u3011\u3010Tomorrow at 7:30am, the reading test will begin. Please don\u2019t be late.\u3011\u3010I wish you good results.\u3011\u00b7You Huo and Qin Jiu entered the house. The others were like eagle chicks and they all followed in behind them, packing the living room to the brim.\u201cSo what was the purpose of sewing the dolls just now?\u201d Yu Wen scratched his head and said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell. Seems like you\u2019re fine if you sew and you\u2019re also fine even if you didn\u2019t sew.\u201dOld Yu patted him: \u201cStop dreaming. How can it be that good? It\u2019s probably just not the right time yet. Just wait for it!\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t care about this. He pulled out the recording from his phone: \u201cAnyone have translation tools?\u201dYu Wen quickly said: \u201cI do, I do!\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s no signal here.\u201d Chen Bin said.Yu Wen: \u201cMine doesn\u2019t need to be connected to the internet. The dictionary is already downloaded and there\u2019s also speech recognition!\u201dEveryone was excited.You Huo clicked play and tossed his phone over to Yu Wen.Yu Wen held it like it was treasure.The crowd stared at him in anticipation.Soon, the black widows garbled nonsense finished playing.Everyone didn\u2019t dare speak. They all held their breath.After waiting for another two minutes, Yu Wen said with a pale expression: \u201cFuck\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cThe translation tool doesn\u2019t have Gypsy\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat damned translation tool is that?!\u201dChen Bin and Liang Yuanhao was in disbelief. They pulled out their own phone and soon realised that there really wasn\u2019t.Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dFuck.We\u2019re going to die because of Foreign Language.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Would connecting to the internet help? Can the invigilator help with this?\u201dEveryone heard this and looked over at Qin Jiu.This invigilator was standing in front of a shelf in the living room staring boredly at an incense burner. It was as if he had a pair of eyes on the back of his head. Without even turning around, he said: \u201cThe reward card wasn\u2019t drawn by you. What are you looking at me for?\u201dThe smell of incense in the room was too strong.He pried open the lid, picked out something charred and threw it aside. Throughout the entire process, his slender fingers fiddled with the burner and he didn\u2019t appear to be afraid of being burned.The crowd heard his words and proceeded to look over at You Huo.But before You Huo could speak up, Yu Wen who proposed this suggestion initially calmed back down, \u201cForget it. The dictionary should have all been downloaded. I was just casually suggesting it\u2026\u2026\u2026..If several translation tools all don\u2019t have Gypsy, then we probably won\u2019t be able to find it even if we connected to the internet. If we don\u2019t end up finding anything then that card would be wasted for nothing.\u201dChen Bin looked back and forth. He couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cWhat card? Ever since I\u2019ve joined this group, I keep hearing you mention it but I was too embarrassed to ask about it.\u201dBack when the card was drawn, everyone in the group saw it. Since they all knew about it there was no point hiding it.Everyone quickly explained to Chen Bin the reward card and its use.Chen Bin who heard this was stunned: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..There really are rewards? I have only heard rumours about it and thought it was all just a lie. What did you do? How did you get that opportunity?\u201dEveryone was ashamed. They internally thought: It was all because the system had randomly formed the group allowing them to hug onto a golden thigh.Chen Bin was quite understanding. Seeing everyone\u2019s change in expression, he didn\u2019t ask any further.He glanced at Liang Yuanhao only to see that the other party had his lips pursed tightly together. He wore a bad expression on his face. In fact, he himself also didn\u2019t look too great.Although they didn\u2019t see the reward card themselves, they had heard about it.No matter what the reason was that allowed them to be given the opportunity to be rewarded, it proved to them one thing \u2014\u2013 This group was very powerful.Or more specifically, there is a very powerful person in the group.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogAs for who that person was, it was self-evident.The two of them had just happened to choose to do the opposite of that great master.Chen Bin nudged Liang Yuanhao gently and, while others were still discussing things, he whispered: \u201cDo you regret it?\u201dLiang Yuanhao had a bad expression. He said roughly: \u201cThe consequences haven\u2019t been revealed yet. Getting it right once doesn\u2019t mean he will always be right. I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d\u201cI do a little.\u201d Chen Bin grimaced before looking down at the ground.\u00b7\u201cBrother, do you want to get the invigilator to help?\u201d Yu Wen asked.\u201cNo.\u201dYou Huo sat on the sofa armrest and continued to play with his phone.Qin Jiu replaced the lid of the incense burner.He then casually picked up a colourful towel and used it to wipe his fingers before casually moving behind You Huo. With both hands pressing down on the back of the sofa, he said: \u201cYou\u2019re really not? I\u2019ve been holding onto this card for a very long time and I can\u2019t wait to use it.\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t even look up and just snorted in response.Qin Jiu was even more amused.This examinee was really interesting. He wouldn\u2019t hesitate to ask simple questions that fall within the boundaries of the examination rules and would even treat the invigilator rudely but, when it came to the help card, he was unwilling to use it. It was as if asking for help was equivalent to him bowing his head.What a hard to chew piece of bone.Invigilator 001 commented inside.\u00b7You Huo tapped on his phone a few times and the black widow\u2019s young woman-like voice rang through the room.It wasn\u2019t like English. Everyone could understand English. Even if they were poor at it, if you played it a few times at a slower pace, you could get about 70-80%.They didn\u2019t know anything about Gypsy so even if the recording was played for an entire day, nothing would happen.They sat around silently in the living room whilst engulfed by despair and garbled noise.\u00b7That audio was played about ten times. Someone suddenly snapped their finger.Everyone snapped back to their senses: \u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong?\u201dThe one who snapped their finger was Mike.He opened his mouth and carefully listened to the last few words spoken by the black widow before exclaiming excitedly.Because he spoke too fast, it sounded like garbled nonsense.Old Yu and the others were confused for a long time. They turned and asked You Huo: \u201cWhat did he say?\u201dYou Huo furrowed his brows: \u201cHe\u2019s saying that the black widow\u2019s Gypsy has Persian and Russian words mixed in.\u201dHe turned and asked Mike: \u201cYou sure?\u201dAs a four-country mix, although Mike\u2019s looks didn\u2019t live up to his blood, he still possessed basic language skills. He slowed down and explained that his grandfather was Russian. Although he wasn\u2019t proficient in Russian, his vocabulary wasn\u2019t bad. As for Persian, he had taken a few electives on that in university.During the process of migration, gypsies often become influenced by the people and places that they have lived in so foreign languages were incorporated into their language.They would also learn the local languages just like how the black widow could understand the Chinese spoken by the examinees.The village chief had mentioned that the black widow came over along with several Russians to escape the war. She was probably influenced by those Russian companions.She herself probably didn\u2019t realise it.\u00b7When they heard this, everyone was immediately excited.Yu Wen stared at Mike with dog-like eyes of admiration and said: \u201cQuick! Hurry and tell us! What did you hear?\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesHearing this question, Mike was a little embarrassed.His slightly chubby face flushed pink and he ummed and ahed a few times before uttering out a few words.\u201cGrave\u201d\u201cFlower\u201d\u201cNeedle\u201d\u201cSun\u201dYou Huo looked over at Mike before turning to the group and saying: \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat were the questions again?\u201d Old Yu asked.Yu Wen replied expressionlessly: \u201c1. What is the black widow\u2019s name, 2. Where is the black widow\u2019s family and 3. How many people are there in the black widow\u2019s house.\u201dThose four words, none of them answered the question\u2026\u2026\u2026..All the hope that surged inside them instantly dissipated.Everyone\u2019s eager expressions fell and their faces turned dull.\u00b7Before they knew it, the sun had moved to the west. It hid behind the woods, emitting a dim afterglow.Yu Yao who sat next to the window suddenly looked past the curtains and said quietly: \u201cThe villagers\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Yu Wen moved over, \u201cWhat villagers?\u201dYu Yao pulled the curtains open completely and pointed out the small circular window: \u201cThere are some people on the other side of the river. They\u2019re probably villagers?\u201dThe frozen river glowed from the sun\u2019s rays. On the other side of the light, there were several figures coming out of a house. They carried baskets and carefully made their way towards the river.\u201cIt really is.\u201d Chen Bin muttered: \u201cThe village chief mentioned that they would come out to do things at dusk and that it would become livelier but\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHow is it lively with only two or three people???\u00b7In any case, where there are people, there are clues.You Huo put on his black down jacket and pulled the zip all the way up to his chin to cover the lower half of his face. He then proceeded to step out the door.The others all followed behind him.Qin Jiu unhurriedly walked next to You Huo. He then fell half a step behind.\u201cClothes bought using points?\u201dYou Huo narrowed his eyes and looked at him through the thin slits.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blog\u201cAlthough I have received several gifts from you, I am very generous so let me give you some words of advice.\u201dQin Jiu stuffed his hands into his coat pocket and slowly walked across the frozen river alongside him, \u201cIn this exam, only a handful of people pass. In any case, during my time as an invigilator I haven\u2019t seen many. For most examinees, it\u2019s best not to spend them so recklessly.\u201dYou Huo\u2019s straight nose was covered under his jacket but white fog still formed as he breathed.He walked over to the opposite bank. His light-coloured eyes moved, and it fell onto a middle-aged woman standing not far away.The woman was dressed in a typical winter outfit. She wore an extremely long winter coat that wrapped her from neck to feet, and her head was almost completely buried inside a large scarf.She crouched awkwardly by the edge of the river and waved at the man next to her: \u201cHere, chisel the ice.\u201dYou Huo watched them for a moment before tossing out a line to Qin Jiu: \u201cGo give those words of advice to someone else. I don\u2019t need it.\u201dAfter that, he proceeded to walk towards the two villagers.\u00b7The two villagers saw You Huo and was stunned for a moment. Their stiff expression then slowly turned into a smile: \u201cAre you new visitors? The village chief mentioned it earlier.\u201dYou Huo glanced at the village chief\u2019s house. It\u2019s doors and windows were tightly shut.\u201cYes, just arrived this morning.\u201d He replied.The villagers nodded. They weren\u2019t very enthusiastic: \u201cYou live on the other side?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dVillagers: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe pair of man and woman fell silent for a moment. Then then said: \u201cDo you have anything you want to ask us? You must still be feeling uncomfortable since you\u2019ve just arrived?\u201dYou Huo looked up: \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dThe two of them: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThey looked at each other for a while before turning back to continue digging into the ice. After digging for a while, they once again glanced at You Huo.\u201cHave you gone to the black widow\u2019s place?\u201d The middle-aged woman couldn\u2019t help but ask.You Huo nodded: \u201cYes, stayed there all afternoon.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u2026..What did you do?\u201dYou Huo said: \u201cMade a few dolls. Don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever seen them?\u201dThe two villagers paused. They appeared a little scared.You Huo then said: \u201cAnd some didn\u2019t make any.\u201dWhat was strange was that they villagers again started to tremble.After a moment, the woman looked up and said: \u201cNo, usually only visitors visit the black widow. We rarely go across the river.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cThere were visitors before?\u201dThe woman nodded: \u201cYes. They were like you and would always come in groups.\u201dYou Huo said: \u201cWhat happened to them afterwards?The woman was confused for a moment. She then shook her head and said: \u201cSeems like\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026I didn\u2019t see them leave.\u201dThe other examinees who had just crossed the river heard this and almost slipped on the river.Qin Jiu walked over and stopped next to You Huo. He bowed his head slightly and said: \u201cYou really like to humour people.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhen he was about to retort, the metal basin in the male villager\u2019s hand fell onto the ground with a clang.The two looked over and saw the man staring at You Huo for a few seconds and then looking at Qin Jiu for a few seconds. He slowly spoke up: \u201cI seem to\u2026\u2026\u2026have seen you two somewhere.\u201dYou Huo was surprised: \u201cWho? Us?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was both hard and cold.You Huo withdrew his hand. He had a bad expression.\u201cWhere have you seen us?\u201d He flexed his wrist as he asked.The male villager stood in place and was blank for a few seconds. Then, as if he didn\u2019t hear that question, he repeated: \u201cI have definitely seen you\u2026\u2026.I\u2019ve seen you.\u201d\u201cAh, he\u2019s at it again.\u201d The woman placed down the chisel and sighed: \u201cSorry about this. This person has some issues.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not so good here.\u201d The woman pointed to her head and explained, \u201cIt comes and goes. When it relapses, he likes to grab people and say that they look familiar and that he had seen them somewhere before. Or he would just go around asking people \u2018Do you know me?\u2019, \u2018Do you remember me?\u2019\u201dAs soon as she said that, the male villager grabbed Qin Jiu\u2019s hand. He asked in a quiet voice: \u201cYou know me. Do you remember me?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe woman said: \u201cSee? Just like that.\u201d\u201cWhat made him like this?\u201d Qin Jiu asked.The woman thought for a moment and shook her head: \u201cHe has always been like this.\u201dShe called out and the other two people fetching water by the river came over. With one on each side, they supported the male villager up.\u201cTake him back first. He\u2019ll probably act like this for a while.\u201d The woman said.The two villagers nodded and dragged the man back into the house.As he was being taken away, the male villager again grabbed Yu Wen who was closest to him. He struggled and said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen them. I really have seen them before.\u201dHis skin was dark, and his face was covered with dry cracked lines. This was particularly serious around the corners of his mouth and eyes. He had several strands of white hair making him look even more haphazard.Yu Wen was started by him, but he also felt a little bad for him.He said: \u201cDon\u2019t drag him like this. Should I help you?\u201dThe two villagers shook their heads: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re used to it. He\u2019s strong when he starts going crazy, so you won\u2019t be able to hold him down. We can only do it this way. Also\u2026\u2026..\u201dOne of them spoke bluntly: \u201cYou are the black widow\u2019s guests. We\u2026\u2026..uh, don\u2019t welcome strangers into our homes.\u201dVery quickly, the male villager was dragged into a red-roofed house. The door closed and soon there were no more sounds.This incident made everyone look at each other with confusion.But these villagers were equivalent to the NPC\u2019s in games. The things that happened between NPC\u2019s were probably fixed plotlines, so it wasn\u2019t a good idea stepping in before you understood the whole situation.So they just took this situation in and no one dare to act.You Huo mentally noted down the house before looking away.After chatting for a while, their relationship was still quite distant. The great master became impatient and no longer went around in circles anymore. He asked directly: \u201cDo any of you know Gypsy?\u201dThe woman again dug at the ice.Her hand was raised high and the chisel hit the ice heavily, bringing along with it a lot of fine shards of ice.One after another, the speed was fast, and the strength was powerful.The people watching on felt inexplicably scared. It was as if she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to bring it down even if a person was lying there before her.After smashing against the ice a few times, she shook her head: \u201cNo. No one does.\u201dPlease read this from kk translates\u201cBut the village chief said that the black widow works with the dead. If none of you understand Gypsy, how did you communicate with her?\u201d Old Yu couldn\u2019t help but ask.The woman said: \u201cIt was always visitors who came for her. We don\u2019t need to. And she wasn\u2019t alone before. There was also an old guy and several children who didn\u2019t speak Gypsy.\u201dOld guy? Children?Everyone sensed that they had managed to get some information and was very excited: \u201cAre they the black widow\u2019s family?\u201dThe woman nodded: \u201cI guess.\u201d\u201cWhere are they? \u201cWhere did they go?\u201dThe woman shook her head: \u201cLeft. I don\u2019t know where they went. Maybe they went home? In any case, they suddenly disappeared.\u201d\u201cDoes anyone know?\u201dThe woman again shook her head. She said: \u201cNo. We don\u2019t dare ask the black widow.\u201dEveryone became dejected again.You Huo glanced at the setting sun in the distance and asked, \u201cAre there graves here?\u201dThe woman\u2019s hand stopped.She fell silent for a while before suddenly looking up and smiling at everyone.With a smile on her face, she looked livelier, but it also gave them a creepy feeling.She awkwardly raised her arm and casually pointed in the distance, \u201cSee those trees?\u201dEveryone turned around,The dense trees making up the woods enclosed the village in an airtight circle.The woman smiled and said: \u201cThe graves are there. This entire encirclement of trees\u2026\u2026..they\u2019re all graves.\u201d\u00b7The sun settled completely behind the woods and the final rays of sunlight disappeared.Before they knew it, the sky had darkened.The woman looked up and quickly picked up her metal basin.\u201cWait.\u201d You Huo grabbed her.The woman struggled a few times: \u201cWhat do you want?! It\u2019s dark now, don\u2019t grab me! I\u2019m going back!\u201d\u201dShe was very strong. You Huo didn\u2019t expect this. In his moment of surprise, she managed to break free.The woman carried the basin and backed away a few stops. She urged the onlookers: \u201cYou should also hurry back home. It\u2019s dark now!\u201d\u201cWhat happens when it\u2019s dark? The village chief also mentioned it before. You don\u2019t come out when it\u2019s dark?\u201dThe woman trembled.She wrapped her scarf tightly around her and warily looked around. She then whispered: \u201cGhosts come out at night. They\u2019re everywhere. They would knock on your doors, open your windows, stand by the bed or hide under it. You have to be careful\u2026\u2026..\u201dAfter that, she pressed her index finger over her lips and made a 'shhhh\u201d sound.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHer 'shhh\u201d gesture caused everyone\u2019s hair to rise.After the woman said this, she hurried away with her metal basin.As the sky darkened further, she left very quickly. In the blink of an eye, her figure had already reached a house in the distance.She opened the door, glanced around and then carefully entered. All the doors and windows were tightly shut.In an instant, everything was silent.Several houses still had lights on but because it was very dim and would occasionally flicker, it gave them an even more unnerving feeling.Chen Bin rubbed his arm and said: \u201cWhat do we do? There are no clues for the listening questions. We\u2026\u2026..should we go back and study the recordings again?\u201dThat was a hopeless suggestion.They didn\u2019t have a translation tool and the villagers didn\u2019t understand Gypsy. They were also just told that there were ghosts who liked to knock on doors at night\u2026\u2026\u2026How are they going to solve these questions?\u00b7\u201cI\u2019m entering the woods.\u201dYou Huo suddenly said this.\u201cYou\u2019re going where???\u201d Old Yu was startled by his nephew but before he could finish his question You Huo had already started to walk away.\u201cFuck.\u201d Old Yu didn\u2019t dare swear at his nephew. He cursed at the ground for a moment before shouting out: \u201cWait a minute! You should at least bring a light!\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t look back. He just perfunctorily waved his hand.Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dOld Yu urgently asked: \u201cSomeone here! Give me a flashlight! A phone is fine too! Mine ran out of power after using it this afternoon. I fucking\u2026\u2026..I can\u2019t watch him go into the graveyard alone!\u201dEveryone looked at each other and shook their heads.After repeatedly playing the recordings from their phones the entire afternoon, their phones were all almost completely drained.They didn\u2019t dare use the remaining amount for light lest the phone completely shuts down.\u201cWhat about the experienced ones? You two? Did you bring a flashlight?\u201d Old Yu looked at Chen Bin and Liang Yuanhao.Liang Yuanhao: \u201cNo.\u201dChen Bin waved his hand awkwardly: \u201cThey sold it at the rest stops but\u2026\u2026our points were too low and we didn\u2019t dare buy anything.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026..\u201d Yu Wen suddenly spoke up. He handed over something slender, \u201cI betted on my courage\u2026\u2026\u2026and spent 0.5 points for a light stick. Can that be used?\u201dOld Yu looked at him up and down: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to buy something, why did you buy a light stick?! A box of matches would be better!\u201dYu Wen cried back: \u201cI read too many novels\u2026\u2026\u2026..Some places you can\u2019t use open flames.\u201dHe held the light stick and dragged Old Yu with him to chase after You Huo.Yu Yao said quietly: \u201cI\u2026\u2026I\u2019m going too.\u201dThe group all followed after You Huo leaving behind Liang Yuanhuo and Chen Bin.\u201cThey\u2026\u2026..why are they so reckless???\u201d Chen Bin muttered, \u201cAre we going too?\u201dLiang Yuanhao had a dark expression: \u201cThey already said that it\u2019s all graves there. You can go if you want to go. I\u2019m going back.\u201d\u00b7The woods were extremely quiet. There weren\u2019t even sounds of birds.You Huo stepped onto a few branches and kicked them behind him.Qin Jiu chuckled lazily and dragged out his words: \u201cCan you be a little more considerate? There\u2019s someone behind you.\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t respond and just kicked a few more broken branches behind him.Qin Jiu snorted.Please read this from kk translatesYou Huo crossed his arms and walked around the graveyard like he was walking through a park. The darkness didn\u2019t appear to affect him.\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t need a light? I can lend it to you.\u201d Qin Jiu said.You Huo: \u201cNight vision is good so no need to worry about it. Can you shut up and be quiet for a while?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cDon\u2019t want to.\u201dYou Huo ignored him.After walking in the woods for a while, Qin Jiu stopped his steps, \u201cWho\u2019s calling out?\u201dYou Huo listened for a while and heard Yu Wen\u2019s intermittent shouts: \u201cBrother\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014brother where are you\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201dIn the distance he could see a dim green glow which lit up several people\u2019s faces.You Huo broke a few dried branches up and pulled out a lighter.\u201cOver here! Over here! I see him!\u201d Yu Wen saw the fire and rushed over while alerting the others.Old Yu supported himself using a tree and panted: \u201cHaa\u2026..You\u2026\u2026For heaven\u2019s sake, what are you looking for?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cJust looking around.\u201dEveryone\u2019s faces turned green.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.The, then did you find anything? If not, why don\u2019t we go back first?\u201d Old Yu asked tentatively.You Huo pointed next to his feet with the tree branch: \u201cLook. A row of graves.\u201dEveryone was startled. They looked over in the direction of the fire.You Huo\u2019s toes were pointed at a plot of land and a row of gravestones were lined up across it in a row.The gravestones were engraved with strange words. They looked like letters, but they also looked like round scrawls. This looked very similar the to writing on the stone monument at the entrance of the village. You could tell that it was written by the black widow.Yu Wen was confused: \u201cHow did you find this place?\u201d\u201cThe black widow entered this forest this afternoon.\u201d You Huo crouched down and beckoned Yu Wen over: \u201cDo you still have power left in your phone?\u201d\u201cA little bit.\u201d\u201cTake a photo and copy it onto the black widow\u2019s door.\u201dEveryone froze: \u201cWhat?\u201dDid you want to anger the black widow again??You Huo said: \u201cWhat is on a gravestone?Old Yu said: \u201cThe name of the deceased, photo, date of birth and death.\u201dYou Huo remained expressionless.Old Yu\u2019s desire to survive peaked. He added: \u201cAnd also the relatives of the deceased, and who wrote it.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s right!

The top of You Huo\u2019s foot was stained with a few spots of dirt and it looked very fresh, like it was indeed just stepped on.Qin Jiu looked up: \u201cAm I that bored?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cWho knows.\u201dEveryone else was standing a few steps away so only Qin Jiu who stood right next to him could do something like that.Moreover, who else in this group of people would dare do something like that?Just as Mr. 001 was forced to carry the blame, Yu Wen shouted out: \u201cWho kicked me?

They suddenly looked down.You Huo used the fire to scan his surroundings and saw that there were some changes around him.There were a few raised swells in the ground and the dead branches and leaves that rested above it were pushed aside. It looked as if\u2026\u2026..In just the span of a few seconds, something had crawled out from the ground.Everyone froze. They were filled with dread.The light from the fire turned everyone\u2019s faces pale. Yu Wen\u2019s lips trembled. Just as he was about to say something, You Huo used his index finger to block his lips.In the silence, they started to hear the faint sounds of something crawling.It echoed in the mountains, so it was difficult determining where the sound came from.Some even sounded like it was right next to them\u2026\u2026\u2026Mike and the others were instantly paralysed with fear. They didn\u2019t dare move.You Huo turned around and used the fire to illuminate a patch of grass.Before everyone\u2019s eyes, several pale-coloured things flashed by before quickly disappearing.Looking at it\u2019s actions, it appeared to be heading to the village.\u00b7Chen Bin and Liang Yuanhao stayed in the same house.They felt that it was too reckless rushing into the woods at night or wandering around the village, so they opted for the safest choice and returned back to the house to sleep for the night.Chen Bin stood by the window and asked uneasily, \u201cWe\u2019re really not going to worry about them? It\u2019s not good like that\u2026..\u201d\u201cHow many exams have you taken? Why are you still so indecisive?\u201d Liang Yuanhao stood beside the sink in the bathroom and rinsed his face with cold water. \u201cThis exam is based on the teams score. As long as the question is answered, everyone will get the points. Why should all of us rush over? If they manage to find clues or even the answer, that\u2019s great. We won\u2019t owe them anything and will pay them back next time.\u201dChen Bin: \u201cWhat if they don\u2019t find anything? What if something happened?\u201dLiang Yuanhao\u2019s movements stopped. He took a towel and dried his face. He answered vaguely: \u201cThen\u2026..It\u2019s because they were too reckless. Didn\u2019t we try to persuade them? The driver and the villagers all said that we shouldn\u2019t enter the woods. They\u2019re the ones who didn\u2019t listen.\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesChen Bin was still listless. Liang Yuanhao added: \u201cLet me tell you straight out. I have taken three exams and the one phrase that I have experienced deeply after all of that is that we should treasure our lives. We shouldn\u2019t let everyone sacrifice their lives. Eggs shouldn\u2019t all be put into the same basket. Even children understand this. This is also considered as leaving us with a retreat route. If something happened to them, we can take up the workload here.\u201dHe fell in thought for a moment and continued: \u201cLike this, we have a better chance of success.\u201dChen Bin looked at him and said: \u201cBrother Liang\u2026\u2026you\u2019re calculating everything like a humanoid calculator.\u201dLiang Yuanhao scratched his head and said impatiently: \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this. I\u2019m sleeping. You should go sleep too.\u201d\u00b7Each rolled up with a blanket, they laid in bed forcing themselves to sleep.They had originally thought that it would take a long time but the incense in the house had an amazing effect on their sleepiness and they soon started to snore.Knocking sounds suddenly sounded from the house nearby. It was very light, but at night the sound was very distinct. It was very unnerving.Chen Bin rolled over. Liang Yunhao continued to snore, unaware of the situation outside.The knocking continued at another house closer to them. This persisted and it gradually got closer and closer\u2026\u2026..A few minutes later, knocking sounds finally sounded in this house as well.Knock, knock, knock.Chen Bin rolled over again. His eyelids fluttered a little.Knock, knock, knock.The knocking sounded again.Chen Bin was startled awake.He didn\u2019t dare open his eyes. He remained motionless in bed listening to the knocking sounds.Then, a layer of cold sweat formed all over him\u2026\u2026\u2026..That noise was coming from under the bed. It struck against his back from across the bed.Knock, knock, knock.That thing seemed to know that he was awake. After three more knocks, a soft voice suddenly sounded: \u201cI\u2019m looking for disobedient guests. Did you sew a doll today?\u201dChen Bin almost wet himself.He squeezed his eyes shut and continued to pretend to be asleep.The voice didn\u2019t stop: \u201cTell me, did you sew a doll today?\u201dLiang Yunhao next to him twitched. He seemed to have also woken up.That voice was now close to their ears: \u201cLet me ask one more time. Did you sew a doll today?\u201dThe room was deathly silent.That voice sighed softly: \u201cHaa\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dLiang Yuanhao suddenly called out: \u201cSewed! I sewed!!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u2026What an obedient guest.\u201d The voice spoke regretfully: \u201cThen you can only live\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dLiang Yuanhao and Chen Bin were terrified. After taking two long seconds to register its words, they felt a little relieved.That voice then asked: \u201cWho sewed more?\u201dLiang Yuanhao immediately said: \u201cMe! Me! I sewed two legs! He only sewed half an arm!\u201dChen Bin was horrified.\u201cThat\u2019s great\u201d That voice said.Liang Yunhao let out a sigh of relief. He quietly peeked out from between his eyelids.But all he saw was a cold flash of light.The last scene he saw was a deathly pale hand holding onto a bone-cleaver smashing down onto his leg.At that moment he recalled the female villager who was smashing the ice by the river.He internally thought: This action looks really similar\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u00b7You Huo and the others practically spent the entire night in the woods, but they couldn\u2019t find those crawling things.The traces left in the dirt had disappeared in an instant and the dead leaves and branches returned back to its original location looking as if it had never been moved.They only came out from the woods when the sky started to brighten up.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to be scary?\u201d Old Yu murmured, \u201cThey said not to enter the woods, but we stayed there for an entire night and nothing happened.\u201dYu Wen a stiff face: \u201cI was scared stiff\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019re still alive, and none of us were hurt.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dBut when they recalled the movements from last night, they felt that things shouldn\u2019t be so simple.Those deathly pale things passed by likely because they had a different target and temporarily let them go.\u00b7The sky very quickly brightened up.The inside of the villager\u2019s houses was still dark. The windows were old and there were still cobwebs on some of the doors.In once glance, it looked like an abandoned old house.You Huo stopped before one of the houses.Everyone was confused. They then recalled that this was the house were the crazy villager stayed.\u201cYou guys go first.\u201d You Huo threw out this sentence and proceeded to knock on the crazy man\u2019s door.\u201cYou\u2019re looking for that villager?\u201d Yu Wen asked: \u201cDo you believe what he said yesterday?\u201dHe knew about You Huo\u2019s memory loss and thought that he was probably sensitive about it.If someone suddenly said that he had seen him before, although he may look unreliable, perhaps his brother got curious and wanted to ask?In the end You Huo responded: \u201cDon\u2019t believe it.\u201dPlease support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogHe had paid careful attention yesterday. The crazy man\u2019s eyes when he looked at him was clouded and it had only brightened up when he saw Qin Jiu.This was particularly the case when he said to Qin Jiu \u201cYou know me\u201d. That expression of his was serious.If that crazy man was speaking the truth, then it would only be the part about Qin Jiu.But at that time Qin Jiu blocked him and he didn\u2019t appear to have any reaction.Moreover, whether this Mr. 001 knows that NPC and whether or not he paid him any attention\u2026\u2026\u2026It had nothing to do with him.You Huo thought this.He knocked on the door purely because the crazy man\u2019s mouth was loose, and it would be easier getting information out from him.\u00b7He knocked for five minutes but he didn\u2019t get a response.\u201cToo afraid to come out? Or is he not up yet? Didn\u2019t the village chief mention that all the villagers are afraid of the things coming out at night so they try to sleep as long as they can and will get up late?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s wait until evening.\u201dEveryone thought of the village chief\u2019s words and decided not to wait.The time for their answers to be submitted was getting closer and closer. They hurried across the frozen river and stood before the black widow\u2019s door.On the door, the listening questions from the day before were still clearly visible. The answer area was still blank.With experience from last time, they very quickly found the pen used for answering the question\u2014\u2014-This time it was a real pen, but the material used to make it was special. It was carved from bone.Yu Wen felt his scalp go numb as soon as he touched it.Question (1) What is the black widow\u2019s name?He pulled out the photo of the gravestones and copied a large section of scrawls onto the door. He didn\u2019t leave behind a single punctuation.Just as he was about to copy the answer for the second question, he was stopped by You Huo.\u201cDon\u2019t copy it.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Yu Wen asked: \u201cThere should also be the names of the black widow\u2019s family here. It\u2019s equivalent to finding the answer to two of the questions.\u201dYou Huo looked at him. His expression clearly reflected his thoughts: Stupid.\u201cCan you use it for tomorrow morning?\u201dYu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026You can.\u201d\u00b7The examinees all surrounded the door waiting for the scoring.After wandering around an entire night without sleeping, You Huo leaned sleepily against the wall.He just happened the see from the corner of his eyes Qin Jiu standing in the distance. He had one hand in his pocket and his other hand was playing with the help card.From this angle and distance, he couldn\u2019t see Qin Jiu\u2019s expression clearly.But You Huo couldn\u2019t help but feel that something was missing from this invigilator 001.As for what it was, he didn\u2019t know\u2026\u2026\u2026Afterall, he had only known Qin Jiu for a few days.\u00b7After waiting for an unknown period of time, Old Yu suddenly cried out. He asked: \u201cIt\u2019s almost time for the answer to be submitted. That Chen Bin and that\u2026\u2026Liang Yuan Hao, why aren\u2019t they up yet?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know. The crow just sent out a reminder earlier. They should have woken up by now?\u201dOld Yu said: \u201cYou guys wait a little. I\u2019ll go call them.\u201dHe said that and then proceeded to knock on Chen Bin and Liang Yuanhao\u2019s door.The knocking on the door and the crows reminder sounded almost simultaneously.It was time for the first answer submission.On the black widow\u2019s door, two words were picked out from the densely packed scrawls and a circle was drawn.Floure Jaroka.Plus 5 points.Everyone was relieved and happy.A golden thigh was indeed a golden thigh.Soon afterwards, a new question appeared on the bottom half.Reading question: The annual Witchcraft Festival has arrived at Chars Village. The black widow has prepared gifts for the villagers. That\u2019s right, they\u2019re the carefully sewn dolls. She wrote a long letter of blessing with messages for each of the villagers. Please read the letter and help the black widow deliver the dolls to the correct villagers based on the information in the letter. The witch god above would punish those who are careless. As for those who are attentive, the villagers will guide them home. There is a way home at a place where there are no trees. Will you be able to find it?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: To Sew or not to SewPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayReading was more despairing than listening,The group all collectively gasped. Before they were able to breath out, Old Yu\u2019s cry travelled over.\u201cMy god! Hurry and come over!\u201dOver the span of just one night, Chen Bin and Liang Yuanhao\u2019s house was turned upside down.There was blood everywhere in the bedroom. It was on the floor, the walls and on the bed\u2026\u2026\u2026..There were also two long stains leading all the way out the front door.When everyone rushed over, Old Yu was plastered up against the wall in the living room: \u201cI was damned shocked by this the moment I went in! There\u2019s nowhere to stand!\u201d\u201cFuck\u2026\u2026\u2026What\u2019s going on? Where are they?\u201dOld Yu pointed to the open bedroom door: \u201cShould still be in bed. There\u2019s a bulge in the blanket. I called a few times but no one answered\u2026\u2026..I wanted to pull it away but I was worried about being too rash.\u201dThe other people\u2019s faces turned pale.They had never seen a scene like this before.\u201cAre, are they still alive?\u201d Yu Wen asked with fear.Old Yu remained silent.With this amount of blood, anyone would have already died.What\u2019s more the smell of blood was quite faint and the blood on the floor was dry\u2026\u2026..It had probably dried up overnight.For a while, no one in the room spoke.They didn\u2019t have very strong feelings towards the two newly joined members. This was especially the case of Liang Yunhao who didn\u2019t leave a very favourable impression whenever he spoke or acted. However, he had never harmed anyone.No one wanted them to end up like this.\u201cI\u2019ll check again\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dAt this moment, Old Yu\u2019s qualities from back when he was a soldier emerged. While everyone was about to vomit from the sight, he wiped the sweat off his face and walked over.He would only be timid before his nephew.But before Old Yu was able to do so, You Huo had already entered the bedroom.Qin Jiu didn\u2019t follow him in.He leaned against the door frame with his arms crossed. The eyes that fell onto You Huo were filled with interest, but his lips were pursed in a straight line. He appeared to be disgusted by this bloody scene but at the same time he also appeared to be indifferent.Old Yu also wanted to enter the bedroom.But a particular invigilator was blocking the door. He considered for a moment but didn\u2019t dare speak up.If I wander around a few times, the invigilator would probably hear me?Old You thought this.But contrary to his expectations\u2026\u2026.He walked four laps and the invigilator didn\u2019t look back.If he wanted the invigilator to give him any attention, he would probably have to want until his next life.Old Yu mulled over this for a long time before uttering a single word: \u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAs soon as he said that, there was the sound of something heavy falling to the ground coming from the bedroom.This as followed by hysterical cry.Yu Wen who had just vomited rushed over: \u201cBrother\u2014\u2014\u2014-Brother what\u2019s wrong?!\u201dOld Yu was also startled.The invigilator blocking the door finally turned around. He glanced at Yu Wen: \u201cYour brother can make this kind of sound?\u201dYu Wen: \u201c???\u201dHe internally thought: What does my brothers cry have to do with you?Soon after, he realised\u2026\u2026That\u2019s right. With his brother\u2019s stubborn personality, even if you killed him he wouldn\u2019t cry out like this.Then\u2026\u2026.who else was in the room?Everyone rushed into the room as the screaming continued.\u201cAre you fucking human or ghost????\u201d Yu Wen stared at the floor next to the bed. He was so frightened, his voice trembled.Everyone looked at the floor. Chen Bin had fallen and was sitting there covered in blood. He was screaming louder than anyone there.You Huo felt a headache forming from all the screaming and shouting. He said coldly: \u201cShut up!\u201dEveryone finally calmed down.They looked at each other with horror and bewilderment for a moment and couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cYou\u2026\u2026..You\u2019re still alive?\u201dOld Yu carefully touched Chen Bin: \u201cAlive. Still alive.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u2026.Liang Yuanhao?\u201dChen Bin was stunned for a moment. He then said quietly: \u201cGone.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean gone?\u201dPlease support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogChen Bin spoke haphazardly: \u201cLast night\u2026\u2026\u2026last night someone knocked on our bed. Asked us about the dolls and even had a knife. I fainted.\u201dThe crowd didn\u2019t understand him.\u201cWait a minute. Speak slowly. Let us hear about it.\u201d Old Yu said.\u00b7About ten minutes later, they finally understood what had happened.\u201cSo the person who sewed the doll would be approached and whatever you have sewed on, you will get that cut off???\u201dChen Bin nodded: \u201cShe asked us who sewed more. Liang Yuanhao said he did and that he sewed two legs. And then\u2026\u2026\u2026.his legs were cut off. I fainted on the spot. At the very end, I heard that voice say to me\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cWhat did she say?\u201dHe swallowed and started to tremble again: \u201cShe said\u2026\u2026..See you tomorrow.\u201d\u00b7Liang Yuanhao had disappeared.The trail of blood in the living from was left behind by him but the blood had stopped abruptly at the door. They didn\u2019t know where he went after that.In fact, they could vaguely guess that Liang Yuanhao was probably dragged into the woods.But the woods circled the village and it was so deep, you couldn\u2019t see the ends of it. If you wanted to find someone in there, it was equivalent to finding a needle in a haystack.They searched for a long time and couldn\u2019t find any traces left behind. They could only return to their houses with the crows warning.\u00b7\u3010Warning: Reading exam has begun. Examinees, please make the most of your time.\u3011The crow repeated this three times. They stiffly knocked on the black widow\u2019s door.Everything felt like it was a copy of yesterday.The black widow once again pulled out a pile of cards and asked the person in front to draw it.Everyone\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t good.They had drawn a grim reaper card yesterday and there was now one less person in their group.If they drew another unlucky card, no one knew what the outcome of that would be.This time, it was Yu Yao standing at the front.The black widow stared at her for a long time. She stared for so long, Yu Yao\u2019s hands started to tremble.She lowered her head and pulled one out.This card wasn\u2019t as easily recognisable as the grim reaper card. On the card was a blond-haired angel playing a musical instrument. In front of the angel was a flag. The flag had a red cross.\u201cWhat card is this?\u201d Everyone was confused.Yu Yao gripped tightly onto the card and whispered: \u201cJudgement.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dThey didn\u2019t think she would recognise it. They then asked: \u201cIs it good or bad?\u201dYu Yao hesitated for a moment. She finally said: \u201cIt represents resurrection, rebirth and good fortune\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s a good card!\u201dEveryone rejoiced.Old Yu said: \u201cResurrection? Then will Liang Yuanhao\u2026\u2026..still be saved?\u201dResurrection and good fortune allowed everyone to relax.The black widow however wasn\u2019t very happy. Her anger was even directed at Yu Yao who drew the card. Her resentful eyes were fixed onto Yu Yao.After a moment, she moved into the house and took out an envelope from her nightstand.Unsurprisingly, it was the letter of blessing mentioned by the question.The black widow handed them the envelope before turning around and pointing at the dolls sitting on the wooden frame. She then started speaking: \u201cYeck, dui, trin, store, pansch\u2026..\u201d\u201cDesh ta sho.\u201dThe black widow finished her garbled speech and rubbed her hands in distress.\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing?\u201d Yu Wen felt like he was watching a mime show.You Huo: \u201cCounting heads.\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesThe black widow appeared unsatisfied with the number of dolls. She dragged the bamboo basket out again and stuffed a ball of yarn in their hands.She turned the hourglass around and once again left the house.\u00b7Following Liang Yuanhuo\u2019s incident, everyone looked down at the yarn balls in their hands in a different light.What fucking yarn ball. This is a damned bone-cleaver!\u201cWho would dare sew\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Old Yu muttered. He then threw the ball of yarn back into the bamboo basket.Everyone followed suit.You Huo however suddenly spoke up.He asked Chen Bin: \u201cRepeat what they said last night.\u201dChen Bin was confused: \u201cWhich?\u201d\u201cThe one about obedient guests.\u201dChen Bin: \u201cOh, that monster asked us if we sewed the dolls. We said that we did. She then said that we were obedient guests and can only live\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dObedient guests can only live?Everyone was stunned.They were too frightened earlier and didn\u2019t pay attention to this.Hearing those words again, it was too terrifying.\u201cObedient guests can only live\u2026\u2026.Then what about the disobedient guests???\u201dYou Huo: \u201cCan only die.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dIf you sewed, you get your limbs or head cut off but if you don\u2019t, you die.Then to sew or not to sew???Everyone was anxious. They didn\u2019t know what to do.Qin Jiu the invigilator was bored watching them panic. He moved to pick up the black widow\u2019s letter. Taking out the pages, he looked at the messy scrawls.Before he could read more than two lines, it was rudely snatched away.\u201cCan you act a little more properly as an invigilator and stop disrupting the exam?\u201d You Huo spat that out and then proceeded to sit down onto the sofa with the letter.\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Qin Jiu maintained the posture of holding the letter. He rubbed his thumb with his index finger a few times before turning his head: \u201cWhat to do? I\u2019m suddenly feeling bored being an invigilator\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dYou Huo sneered: \u201cYour feelings sure are sensitive.\u201d\u201cSo when do you plan to use this help card?\u201d Qin Jiu pulled the card out and waved it in front of You Huo.The great master was unperturbed: \u201cLet it rot.\u201d\u00b7The letter of blessing was filled with nonsensical scribbles. You Huo flipped through it for less than five seconds and eventually threw it aside.Shit question.The invigilator picked up the letter and spoke with some mockery: \u201cWhy? The top students\u2019 clever tricks don\u2019t work anymore?\u201dYou Huo got up and left.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogHe walked around the black widow\u2019s house attempting to find clues for interpreting the Gypsy language.Considering the background of this question, the black widow\u2019s husband was probably Russian so the black widow should be able to speak a bit of Russian. He wanted to see if there were any clues hidden around here\u2026\u2026\u2026But the black widow\u2019s house was very clean. He couldn\u2019t find anything at all.What to do\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u00b7The sand in the hourglass today was more than the one yesterday but everyone still felt that time went by too quickly.\u201cMore than half of the sand is gone. What should we do about the dolls? Sew? Or not sew?\u201d Old Yu asked.Yu Yao whispered in a small voice: \u201cLet\u2019s search around again. Maybe we\u2019ll find something?\u201d\u201cOr\u2026\u2026.We could just go back to the woods for tonight! Didn\u2019t we manage to escape from all that last night?\u201d Yu Wen said.The woods at night was very scary but getting scared to death was better than actually dying.With yesterday\u2019s experience, everyone eagerly agreed.Just as this suggestion was about to be passed unanimously, a particular great master once again started to act alone: \u201cI\u2019m going back to sleep.\u201dYu Wen cried out: \u201cWhy?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cTo try and see if I will die.\u201dEveryone: \u201c???\u201dThis can fucking be tried?\u201cYou\u2019re staying there all by yourself? That won\u2019t do!\u201d Old Yu immediately objected.Hearing this, an invigilator casually spoke up: \u201cExcuse me, am I not considered a person?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Unless they had no other choice, no one dared to mess with him.Oh\u2026\u2026.except for You Huo.As soon as Old Yu thought of You Huo, he could feel a headache forming. Just the thought of the \u201crebellious\u201d You Huo being alone with the \u201cdreadful\u201d invigilator made him feel sick.\u201cThen I also won\u2019t go to the woods tonight.\u201d He said.\u201cIt was all because of you that I was able to live until now. Leaving you behind and taking refuge on our own is just\u2026\u2026..I can\u2019t do it.\u201d Yu Yao whispered, \u201cWhat if we can be of help?\u201dThe others also agreed but their offers were all rejected.Please read this from kk translatesYou Huo threw out a sentence, \u201cToo noisy with too many people\u201d and no longer spoke.The others couldn\u2019t persuade him. They were also afraid of ruining things if they didn\u2019t listen to him so they could only give up.\u00b7The sky gradually darkened, and several villagers came out from the other side of the river. As usual, they were digging at the ice.\u201cLooks like it\u2019s the same people?\u201d Yu Wen counted the heads from the window, \u201cThat one with the huge coat should be that big sister from yesterday? And there\u2019s that crazy man\u2026\u2026.Those two with the leather hats look like the two who dragged the crazy man away yesterday?\u201dThis classmate played plenty of phone and computer games, but his eyesight was very good.The others couldn\u2019t see that far and could only vaguely make out the figures in the distance.You Huo looked on for a while before looking back down at the wooden frame.When the black widow counted the heads, he had also counted with her.There were a total of sixteen completed dolls. He roughly could still remember the distribution of the dolls.But when he looked at it again, the dolls appeared to have\u2026\u2026..quietly moved?If he remembered correctly, the doll on the far left of the first row was lying horizontally this afternoon but it was now sitting upright\u2026\u2026..Just as You Huo moved over to take a closer look, the black widow returned.The first thing she did when she entered was to check their progress.What made her unhappy was that all the guests were empty handed. None of them had listened to her!The black widow stared at them silently for a while. She then suddenly cackled. She staggered over to the wall where the \u201cjudgement\u201d card drawn by Yu Yao was pinned. As she giggled, she turned the upright \u201cjudgement\u201d card upside down.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe group was stunned by this act of hers.You can still move the card even after it was drawn?!They didn\u2019t know what the meaning behind that card was, but they could intuitively sense that it probably wasn\u2019t something good.Yu Yao muttered: \u201cIf it is upside down\u2026\u2026then it means the opposite.\u201dThe opposite of resurrection and hope\u2026\u2026..wasn\u2019t that death and despair?The black widow then pulled out a sack.She placed all the dolls inside the sack and also threw in four unfinished dolls from the bamboo basket. She then stuffed the sack to You Huo who stood closest to her.The four incomplete products were very old and one of it was very dirty. It was as if it had been lying on the ground for a long time, or had been accidentally burnt by fire\u2026\u2026\u2026\u00b7When they received the dolls, they were all ushered out by the black widow.The hourglass today lasted longer than last time so by the time they were out, the villagers had already finished digging at the ice and had returned to their own homes.As soon as these villagers closed their doors, they wouldn\u2019t open the door no matter how much they knocked so they didn\u2019t waste time doing that.They split into two groups. You Huo and Qin Jiu moved to their place of residence while the others crossed the river and headed for the woods.\u201cI still don\u2019t understand why the villagers are so afraid of the woods.\u201d Yu Wen mulled, \u201cAlthough they are all graves, very few of them are exposed. It\u2019s scary but it\u2019s at least better than staying inside?\u201dOld You: \u201cWho knows.\u201dYu Yao said: \u201cThere probably is a reason why they\u2019re afraid\u2026\u2026..\u201dAlthough they went there to hide from danger, they were worried about You Huo so they didn\u2019t\u2019 venture too deep and just stayed on the edge.\u201cLet\u2019s wait here.\u201d Yu Wen looked around, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the way here so we can see my brother\u2019s place from here.\u201dEveryone naturally had no objections. They sat down and chewed on dry, hard bread as they waited for the night to pass.\u00b7Inside the house, the lights were on.You Huo went through the cabinets one by one as Qin Jiu sat on the sofa. He broke a baguette in half.\u201cHalf for you?\u201d He said.\u201cNo need.\u201d You Huo didn\u2019t even look back.He was standing pretty far from the sofa, but he could clearly hear the terrible cracking sound when he broke the bread. You could tell based on that alone how dry it was.Qin Jiu\u2019s voice sounded again: \u201cNot satisfied? Then I\u2019ll give you the bigger half.\u201dYou Huo was hungry for the whole day so he naturally wasn\u2019t in a good mood.He slammed a cabinet door shut and walked over to the sofa menacingly: \u201cDon\u2019t involve me if you want to choke to death.\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesCabinet, stove, drawers, tin cans\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..From the living room to the kitchen and then to the bedroom, he searched every place he could get his hands onto and really couldn\u2019t find anything else to eat.Why won\u2019t this damned testing centre blow up?You Huo unhappily stood back up. His face was touched by something.He glanced down. The broken off half of the baguette was brought before his face and held to his neck like a threatening knife.Qin Jiu said behind him: \u201cDon\u2019t bother. I\u2019ve already searched and there really aren\u2019t anything else to eat.\u201dYou Huo remained expressionless. He refused to compromise.The diligent invigilator again used the corner of the bread to nudge You Huo\u2019s lips. He said: \u201cI suggest you try it. It\u2019s not as bad as you think. I haven\u2019t had an examinee starve to death under my supervision so don\u2019t make this the first case.\u201dYou Huo stubbornly stared at him for a moment before snatching it from him roughly.\u201cThere were clearly three invigilators so why is the one doing fulltime on-site surveillance you?\u201d You Huo broke off a piece of the bread and asked coldly.Qin Jiu returned to the sofa and placed some tea leaves inside a pot that he had cleaned earlier.He placed the crooked pot onto the brazier and then asked back: \u201cAccording to the rules of the test centre, something as boring as fulltime on-site monitoring is usually done by the chief invigilator. Unfortunately, I just happened to be that unlucky person. Why, who do you want to come?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c922, 154. Anyone.\u201dAt least they would know to bring along meat.The fire in the brazier was very strong and the pot soon made a loud whistling noise.Qin Jiu squinted amidst the steam and said: \u201cI\u2019ll help you pass on the message. They will surely be very happy to hear that they are remembered by an examinee.\u201dThose words were normal, but it sounded like he was mocking him when it was spoken by him.You Huo ignored that comment.As the tea boiled, the room fell into silence for a while.You Huo ate a few mouthfuls of the dry bread and lost his appetite. He patted off the bread crumbs and glanced at Qin Jiu: \u201cYou\u2019re the chief invigilator?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cI don\u2019t look like one?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cWho gave you those ranks?\u201d\u201cAbility? Combat power? It is said that they take into consideration many things.\u201dQin Jiu acted like he didn\u2019t care much about it. Even when talking about himself, he would always use the words \u201cit is said\u201d.You Huo: \u201cSo 001 is first?\u201dQin Jiu laughed. He stretched his long legs and changed his posture: \u201cNot necessarily. It is said that there once was also a starter value. I guess\u2026\u2026..that person\u2019s my senior?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: Rank APrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cThe starter value\u2026\u2026\u2026000?\u201d You Huo casually said.\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d said Qin Jiu.According to the very limited information available, the system at that time wasn\u2019t the way it is right now. At that time, all the invigilators were specially selected. Despite the small number, they were all top elites.Amongst these invigilators, one was exceptionally young and exceptionally powerful.\u201cIt was something from many years ago now.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cAt that time, they used alphabets for the ranks. That person was rank A.\u201dPerhaps it was because the tea was boiling in the pot causing steam to rise up, when he heard the \u201crank A\u201d You Huo was distracted for a moment.Qin Jiu rubbed his thumb against the edge of the cup and raised his eyebrow, \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that you seem to be very interested in this senior of mine?\u201dYou Huo returned to his senses.He had already tossed the bread aside earlier. He supported his chin with his hand and his expression turned cold again: \u201cIt was boring waiting for the tea, so I was just casually asking. Where is that invigilator with the ability to crush you now?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re wording is not very accurate.\u201d Qin Jiu corrected him: \u201cWhen he was an invigilator, I was still an examinee. When I later became an invigilator, I didn\u2019t work with him much so it\u2019s hard to say who can crush who.\u201dYou Huo snorted.\u201cAs for where he is now\u2026\u2026..\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cDead? I\u2019m not entirely sure. In any case, he was erased by the system.\u201dYou Huo noticed a subtle change in his tone. He looked up and said: \u201cYou don\u2019t like him.\u201dQin Jiu laughed a little. The corners of his lips then lazily hung down.Because of the systems mistake, a part of Qin Jiu\u2019s memory was missing. All the people and events from those years were forgotten and this naturally included that invigilator A. For self-review of this malfunction, all relevant data over those years were sealed by the system and no one could access it.All his knowledge of invigilator A came through word of mouth.It is said that when he was an examinee, he would always pick fights with A.It is said that their relationship was still very bad during the time they worked together.It is said that system\u2019s malfunction at that time only affected the area he and invigilator A governed. At that time, the two of them couldn\u2019t come to an agreement eventually resulting in severe losses on both ends. Qin Jiu took a journey through the gates of hell while invigilator A was erased by the system.\u2026\u2026..As for all these \u201cit is said\u2019s\u201d, there was no way to tell how much of it was true and how much of it was false.Regarding the system\u2019s malfunction at that time, Qin Jiu had almost completely forgotten about it. All that was left was a very vague memory of a particular scene.That place was a site filled with ruins. Surrounding him were metal protective fencing. There were rusty automobiles and machinery scattered around along with broken electric cables\u2026\u2026..He sat on a metal pipe lying on the ground with one leg bent and his arm resting on his knee. The front of his shirt was covered in blood.He coughed a few times and then chuckled.There was another person in front of him.As for what that person looked like and what he wore, he couldn\u2019t remember. Instead, all he could remember was that far into the distance behind that person was a seemingly endless forest.Considering all those \u201cit is said\u2019s\u201d, that person was probably invigilator A.That was the only trace of him left in his memories after all these years.And every time he recalled this scene, his mood would become very bad.How bad would it become?It was as if\u2026\u2026\u2026.he would never be happy again.But if you called it hatred, it also didn\u2019t seem to be the case.\u00b7The smell of boiled tea emanated out from the pot. Although it wasn\u2019t very fragrant, it was still refreshing.You Huo stared at Qin Jiu for a moment before standing up. He pulled out a mug that looked okay and unashamedly pouring himself a cup.He took a few sips before finally feeling the congested sensation in his chest from eating the dried bread earlier clear up.Earlier it was as if something had came over him causing him to chat with the invigilator. Now that he was refreshed, he had returned to his usual state. He placed the mug down and walked into the bedroom.\u00b7The bedroom was rather tidy.There were several blankets stuffed inside the wardrobe. They were specially left there for guests who had come here to meet their unfortunate ends.You Huo pulled one out with the intention to take a nap but the moment he closed the door and inadvertently caught sight of the sofa in the living room, he stopped in his tracks.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogA minute later, the great master threw another blanket onto the sofa. Because he did it very roughly, it almost hit the invigilator\u2019s face. Qin Jiu who was still holding his tea cup was surprised by this sudden attack from behind. He looked at the blanket with surprise and turned to look at You Huo.You Huo had the expression \u201cwhy don\u2019t you invigilators go die?\u201d. He sleepily went back into the bedroom and impolitely slammed the door shut with it a \u201cbang\u201d.\u00b7In the middle of the night, the village was tranquil.The monsters with knifes that they anticipated didn\u2019t appear.You Huo desperately tried to keep his eyes open and he waited for two hours.. Eventually gave up and fell asleep.Knock, knock, knock.That sound initially started from the wall outside but it soon changed into knocking coming from inside the wall.Knock, knock, knock.In just a few minutes, the knocking sounded from under the bed. It knocked at the bed board directly reverberating into You Huo\u2019s back.You Huo didn\u2019t react. He had always been difficult to wake once asleep.Knock, knock, knock.You Huo still didn\u2019t move.With the side of his face pressed down into the pillow and one arm covering his eyes, he slept soundly.Please read this from kk translatesThe knocking persisted for about five minutes, but no one paid it any attention.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe knocking finally stopped. It seemed to be very confused and also a little annoyed.The bedroom fell into silence for a while. Suddenly, there was the sound of something crawling. Like the sound they heard in the woods last time, it sounded like something crawling across the wooden floor.That thing crawled from the bedroom to the living room and found another living human in the other room.Knock, knock, knock.The knocking sounded again.Just as the first round of knocking ended, the invigilator sleeping on the sofa moved a little.With his eyes still closed, his brows furrowed into a frown.From the direction of the coffee table, a female voice asked eerily: \u201cI\u2019m looking for disobedient guests. Did you sew a doll today?\u201dInvigilator: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe exam question must have gone crazy.It dared to even cut up the invigilator?Qin Jiu didn\u2019t even open his eyes. He said: \u201cDidn\u2019t sew. What to do?\u201dThe female voice let out a soft sigh. It was as if she truly felt regretful.The next second, a pale arm rose up and the bone-cleaver in its hand moved to strike.But just before it fell, it was caught by another hand.It couldn\u2019t budge an inch.Qin Jiu sat up with the monster caught in his hand. He was even able to casually reach over and turn on the light with his right hand.As soon as the light turned on, the monster\u2019s true appearance could finally be seen.In fact, it couldn\u2019t really be called a monster. It was just an arm.There was no head, no face and no body. There was nothing else. It was just an arm.Based on its wound, it was probably cut off. It didn\u2019t look like it was done recently so it probably happened a long time ago.Considering what happened to Liang Yuanhao last night\u2026\u2026\u2026.This arm probably belonged to an unfortunate examinee.Because it didn\u2019t have a body limiting it, the arm was extremely flexible and agile.Holding onto the bone-cleaver, it twisted and turned whilst in Qin Jiu\u2019s grasp as it tried to cut off the other party\u2019s head.Qin Jiu was annoyed.He coldly sneered and pulled out a rope from under the coffee table. After tying the hand up together with the knife, he carried the gift over and moved to knock on a particular sleeping gods door.\u00b7You Huo was awakened by feathers tickling him.He turned his head and sneezed before rubbing his hair and sitting up in annoyance. Only after opening his eyes, he realised there was someone sitting by the bed.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blog\u201cHow did you get in?\u201d You Huo looked displeased.Qin Jiu shook his finger. The keys hanging from it clanged against each other, \u201cUsing the spare key.\u201dYou Huo was unhappy: \u201cYou can\u2019t knock first?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dYou even have the nerve to ask?\u201cWhat\u2019s that in your hand?\u201d You Huo\u2019s eyes fell onto his other hand.There, a pale thing writhed around wildly.Qin Jiu brought the arm before him and said monotonously: \u201cSurprise, it\u2019s your goodnight gift. Do you like it?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cThis thing came over to cut your head off but you ignored it, so it went and found me.\u201d Qin Jiu said, \u201cPlease use some of your self awareness as an examinee and help deal with it.\u201dYou Huo was overwhelmed with disgust for about five minutes by this seemingly warm act of his.He said to Qin Jiu: \u201cGive it.\u201dQin Jiu thought he would kill it or bury it right then and there but, unexpectedly, this ingenious examinee had instead loosened the rope. With one end in his hand, he placed the other end that was bound to the arm onto the ground.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you see? With it writing around like this, it must be trying to go somewhere. I\u2019m walking it back.\u201d You Huo said.Qin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dTwenty minutes later, the group of examinees taking cover inside the woods saw a particular great master in the distance walking a dog\u2026\u2026no, an arm. He was heading straight in their direction!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: DeadPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThat arm moved very quickly.Its five fingers flew up and down as it scurried across the ground.Bound helplessly by the rope, it tried to use the knife in its hand to break free whilst it twisted about but it was brutally suppressed.That scene was so shocking, everyone who saw it didn\u2019t believe their own eyes.They were originally scared to death and desperately trying to stay awake, but now they were instantly started awake by You Huo.\u201cBrother, you\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dAre you having fun? Yu Wen wanted to ask.But when he saw his brother\u2019s expression that clearly indicated that he did not have enough sleep, he swallowed those words back.When You Huo got close, the pale arm that was forcefully made into a leading dog stepped onto its brakes.The ghostly arm held the bone-cleaver struggled around wildly.Everyone fearfully took a step back to avoid the blade before hurriedly gathering over to suppress the arm.Chen Bin asked You Huo with a complicated expression: \u201cHow did you catch it?\u201dThe monster that had almost cut him into pieces last night had become a laughing stock today. Who wouldn\u2019t be dumbfounded by this?In particular, he was the one who was almost chopped up. After managing to escape, his shock from that incident had not yet dissipated yet he was now faced with a scene like this\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201cDidn\u2019t catch it.\u201d You Huo indicated in Qin Jiu\u2019s direction with his chin: \u201cHe gave it to me.\u201dChen Bin: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dGave\u2026\u2026..Qin Jiu shamelessly said: \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cDid I thank you?\u201dQin Jiu nodded and smiled: \u201cI could faintly tell from your words.\u201dNo one expected the invigilator to give them a hand. They were surprised for a moment before asking carefully: \u201cThen\u2026\u2026..was the help card used?\u201dQin Jiu pulled out the card from his pocket. His tone was very regretful: \u201cLooks like it wasn\u2019t.\u201dEveryone was surprised: \u201cHuh? Why?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cWhat help card? He only did that out of self-defence.\u201dQin Jiu stared at the back of his head and then nodded: \u201c\u2026\u2026..Okay then.\u201dSelf-defence?Everyone was even more confused: \u201cThis thing will even attack an invigilator? Has it gone crazy?\u201dYou Huo very briefly filled them in on what happened.Yu Wen hammered his palm: \u201cThen does that mean that as long as we don\u2019t wake up when the monster comes, we\u2019re fine? I knew it! I knew they wouldn\u2019t give us an impossible question. Sure enough, there was a loophole.\u201d\u201cYou say that as if it\u2019s easy. How are you going to make sure you\u2019re asleep? It\u2019s not going to work just keeping your eyes closed.\u201d Old Yu said with frustration.Yu Wen: \u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u2026..How about sleeping pills?\u201d\u201cDumb child, why don\u2019t you try finding the sleeping pills first?\u201dYu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the end, everyone felt that this exam was a little ridiculous.It wasn\u2019t because the exam was impossibly hard and that they were only able to go through it with You Huo there.Rather\u2026\u2026\u2026The black widow and even the ghost arm were behaving unreasonably.For example, in addition to the exam requirements, the black widow also added extra hurdles for them such as drawing cards and sewing dolls. Another example was that the ghost arm would turn around and attack an invigilator after losing its initial target.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Please read this from kk translates\u201cIt\u2019s really strange\u2026\u2026.\u201d Yu Yao asked tentatively, \u201cCould this be different to the previous exams? To increase the difficulty, they added extra hurdles?\u201dThis young lady had made a lot of progress. She was pretty much crying the entire time during the last exam, but she was a lot better now.Everyone there didn\u2019t have an answer to that.Also, the final result depended on the exam. Even if they had a clue, they were not guaranteed how long they could live.\u2027\u201cDid anything happen in the woods tonight?\u201d You Huo asked.\u201cIt was almost the same as last night.\u201d\u201cLots of things crawling but they moved too fast and we weren\u2019t able to chase after them.\u201d Yu Wen said: \u201cThey crawled away very quickly and disappeared. Now that I think about it\u2026\u2026..It probably was similar to that.\u201dHe glanced at the pale arm.You Huo let out an \u201coh\u201d and motioned for everyone to let go of the arm.He tugged at the rope and said: \u201cHere, keep going.\u201dGhost arm: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThis thing was bullied very terribly. It laid on the ground pretending to be dead and didn\u2019t move for a long time.You Huo waited for a moment and lost patience. He kicked it and said: \u201cDon\u2019t go then. Later when the sun rises, I\u2019ll drag you out the woods.\u201dThese things would disappear during the day and would only come out at night. There must be a reason for this.You Huo guessed that they perhaps could not be exposed to the sun? Or perhaps they were afraid of something else\u2026\u2026..Sure enough.As soon as he said this, the ghost arm flailed and twisted around wildly.\u201cIs it scared?\u201dSeeing that the threat was working, everyone began to throw out harsh words.\u201cIt\u2019s now 4 o\u2019clock. It\u2019s going to be dawn soon.\u201d\u201cWe can also let the villagers see what was threatening them at night and knocking on their doors\u2014\u2014-\u201dYu Wen went on to talk about taking a \u201c1-day trip around the village\u201d when the arm suddenly stopped.It laid there with its grey, decaying fingers scratching against the ground.It was as if it was moving to its own breathing frequency, but it also seemed to be anxious and fearful\u2026\u2026What are you afraid of?The villagers?You Huo furrowed his brows.When he was about to pull at the rope and say something, the hand suddenly started to move.Its five fingers scratched at the ground and it quickly flew deep into the woods. It appeared to be desperately wanting to return to its hideout.Everyone followed it along and went through the forest but soon they lost their sense of direction.There was still morning fog in the woods, and it was extremely cold.The thick fog made the light cast from the fire torch appear a little dim. It flickered as if it was going to extinguish any moment.\u201cWhat\u2019s this smell?\u201d Old Yu breathed in deeply through his nose.As they ventured deeper, the smell in the woods got stronger and more distinct.Chen Bin\u2019s expression changed: \u201cThis smell\u2026\u2026..It\u2019s similar to the one from our room. Last night Liang Yuanhao and I smelt this and fell asleep.\u201dNow that he mentioned it, everyone remembered the smell.It was a little different to the one in the black widow\u2019s place and it made them sleepy.Mike was physically weak and after staying up the entire night and running around, he immediately stumbled and fell to the ground.The others also soon got affected.Amidst the chaos, the ghost arm took the opportunity to move around the trunk of a tree.The moment the rope got tense, the knife cut through it. With the snap of the rope, the arm plunged into the wet mud and disappeared in a blink of an eye.Everyone looked around, but they couldn\u2019t find any traces of the arm.\u201cShit\u2014\u2014\u2014We were so close!\u201dEveryone lamented.But they could only accept that it was gone. Even if they weren\u2019t happy, they couldn\u2019t do anything about it.\u2027The sun soon rose.At five minutes before 7:30am, the crow cried out to remind everyone that it was almost time to submit their answer.Please read this from kk translatesYu Wen held his phone and praised his brother: \u201cFortunately you stopped me yesterday and didn\u2019t let me answer. Otherwise we\u2019re finished today\u2026\u2026..\u201dStrictly speaking, they had also gained something tonight, but it wasn\u2019t something that helped with answering the questions and earning points. Thanks to You Huo and his ability to think ahead, they had left listening question 2 to be answered today. If they didn\u2019t, someone would need to die.Where is the black widow\u2019s family? Please find them.The answer was very simple. It could either be the woods or the graves. Afterall, her family members were already buried in the ground and several gravestones were set up for them.Yu Wen grabbed the bone pen and wrote \u201cwo\u201d. Just as he was about to write \u201cods\u201d, a voice slowly spoke up behind him.\u201cI have a question.\u201d Qin Jiu raised two fingers.\u201cHurry and write.\u201d You Huo urged Yu Wen and turned to Qin Jiu: \u201cWhat question do you have that must be asked at this time?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cI tried to hold back but I couldn\u2019t.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cSpeak.\u201dQin Jiu knocked on the door, \u201cThe exam is testing you on Gypsy but you\u2019re answering in Chinese. You are such a rare talent.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dEveryone swore inside. They were too careless! The questions were all written in Chinese and it made them subconsciously answer in Chinese.As soon as Qin Jiu reminded them, the red light on his wrist appeared and a warning sounded three times.Just as the crow opened its mouth to speak, Qin Jiu spoke up first: \u201cArticle 7 of the invigilator\u2019s manual: In the event that an examinee misunderstands the question or the question is too ambiguous, the invigilator has the obligation to guide them. Isn\u2019t what they\u2019re doing now something completely stupid?\u201dHe said this mockingly and then turned to the examinees: \u201cSorry if I offended you.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe words spoken were polite but there was a hint of mockery and joke in his voice that made them feel a little irritated.After angering the examinees, Qin Jiu then casually said to the crow: \u201cI was just doing my job. Being a full-time invigilator is boring enough so stop nit-picking.\u201dEveryone present was too afraid to even breathe. They felt that this invigilator would probably die the next second.Unexpectedly, the crow opened its mouth for a moment before closing it again and remained silent.Qin Jiu was still leaning against the door frame. His posture remained unchanged throughout this exchange. He glanced back at the group and said: \u201cThere are still two minutes before time is up. Is the answer written on my face?\u201dYu Wen held the bone pen in panic: \u201cBrother, how do you write woods or grave in Gypsy?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026..Don\u2019t know.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: The Great Master Had Gone MadPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cRight! Didn\u2019t Mike hear the word grave last time after listening to the recording? He should know!\u201dAt this critical moment, Yu Wen\u2019s memory was at its best.He jumped up to find him: \u201cWhere\u2019s Mike?! Where did he go?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s still out cold on the sofa.\u201d Old Yu flew over to the room.Mike\u2019s response to the smell in the woods was particularly strong. After returning, he vomited twice and was laid to rest on the sofa. Even now, he has not woken up.Everyone was very confident, so they didn\u2019t wake him up.No one expected this kind of trouble to happen at such a critical moment.\u201cSorry, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dOld Yu went up and slapped him a few times before finally waking Mike up.Mike was still feeling dizzy from the smell and retched a few times as soon as he opened his eyes.\u201cUp! Up! Up!\u201dOld Yu used the only English word he knew and dragged Mike out.\u00b7In front of the black widow\u2019s door, You Huo held onto the bone pen.He wrote very quickly and managed to copy everything on the gravestones in two minutes. In order to save time, he let out the black widow\u2019s name.As soon as Mike came over, he finished off the last stroke and shoved the pen over to the other party: \u201cWrite.\u201dAmidst the final two calls by the crow, Mike added the word \u201cGrave\u201d.\u2026\u2026\u2026.Phew\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013They made it in time.Everyone let out a long sigh of relief.\u201cWe were almost on the brink of death\u2026\u2026\u201d Yu Wen clutched his chest. The heart that was almost about to fall out and calmed back down, \u201cI hope the gravestones wrote where they were buried instead of just \u2018here lies xxx\u2019.\u201dBut it didn\u2019t matter. Even if it wasn\u2019t written, there was still the words written by Mike.With the answers offering double insurance, they would most certainly get those points.This was what everyone thought.After waiting for a while, the answer wall finally changed.The system\u2019s results came out\u2026\u2026..It was a cross.A bright red cross appeared there. To its left was the copied gravestone inscriptions and to the right was the word grave written by Mike.The meaning was obvious: Neither were correct.Everyone, including You Huo, were stunned. The result was something they didn\u2019t expect.\u201cIt\u2019s wrong? How can that be?\u201d\u201cDid the system malfunction and made the wrong judgement?\u201dEveryone couldn\u2019t understand why their answer was wrong.You Huo stared at the answer wall with deeply furrowed brows.The inscriptions and the word grave were not correct. If there weren\u2019t any issues with the system\u2019s judgement then it meant one thing \u2014\u2014\u2013 These were the graves of the black widow\u2019s family, but they were not buried there.His eyes moved and it fell onto the third question.Question 3: How many people are in the black widow\u2019s room?You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..Question: Is it possible for someone who is very passionate about superstitions to leave their dead family members in their house?Answer: What can\u2019t that old witch do?!Before everyone could recover from the shock, the answer wall refreshed, and new content appeared.An unfortunate notice: From this round of submission, the system has failed to detect any points.Punishment result: A randomly selected examinee will be sent to enter the coffin.When those words appeared, You Huo patted Qin Jiu\u2019s shoulder.Qin Jiu turned his head and his eyes moved along his finger over to this face: \u201cLet me guess, our Mr Humph finally wants to ask for help?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dWho\u2019s yours?Unless he had no other choice, he really didn\u2019t want to use that help card.But the current situation now was indeed headache inducing.He didn\u2019t know who the system would randomly select, and he didn\u2019t know if he would be able to find a loop hole.If it was really troublesome\u2026\u2026.As he mulled over it, another line appeared.Note: Chars Village traditionally holds funerals late at night. We will follow their tradition and the punishment will be executed tonight.Tonight?The punishment was different to the ones from the previous exam and was not implemented immediately.You Huo immediately retracted his hand from Qin Jiu\u2019s shoulder.Qin Jiu: \u201c?\u201dYou Huo said: \u201cIt\u2019s still too soon.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe looked at You Huo for a while and said: \u201cI think I should give you a small reminder. The system will not give you any warning when they implement the punishment and would not tell you who is selected. It is likely that one moment you may be chatting face to face and the next moment one of you is gone.\u201d\u201cIf the one who disappeared at that time was you, how are you going to ask for help?\u201d Qin Jiu asked.\u201cThat invigilator 922 said that if I need something, I can just write 001.\u201d You Huo responded.Qin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dPlease read this from kk translates\u201cSince we\u2019re on this topic, I just wanted to ask, \u201cYou Huo spoke mockingly, \u201cI heard that it must be written on the answer sheet? What kind of idiotic rule is that?\u201dIt was not an issue in the hunter\u2019s cabin because the space was small, and they were only a few steps away from the answer wall.But for a test centre like Chars Village or another much large one, it was really too unreasonable.Qin Jiu said: \u201c922? I\u2019ll have to take note of that. But that is just a way for one to find normal invigilators.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Then the way to find a self-proclaimed head invigilator like you?\u201d\u201cOh, there are many ways.\u201d Qin Jiu smiled: \u201cYou can try writing it anywhere in the test centre and see if I know.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Am I crazy?\u201d\u00b7When the punishment results came out, everyone reluctantly celebrated for a moment. At least they still had more than half a day for them to prepare.It wasn\u2019t until that afternoon that they realised that this pre-notice punishment style was more terrifying compared to immediate punishment.It was as if there was already a knife held up at their neck. With the sharp blade pressing closely against their skin, the executioner says: \u201cSorry but it is not time yet. Please wait a little.\u201dThe black widow as usual made them sew dolls and didn\u2019t appear to have the intention to stop until all the examinees were cut up.Everyone\u2019s thoughts were all over the place. They sat there restlessly, and their minds were filled with worries.While everyone\u2019s mind was preoccupied by the impending punishment, they didn\u2019t notice a particular great master\u2019s unusual behaviour\u2014\u2014\u2013As everyone worried, he pulled out several dolls from the bamboo basket and picked up a needle.When others sewed dolls, they would pay attention to their stitches. Although it may not be straight, they would at least stitch a row to connect the limbs. He on the other hand just passed the needle through twice and considered it as a limb complete.\u2026\u2026\u2026..When the others finally noticed his actions, the great master had already sewed an entire row.With a quick count, there was a total of eight done.Old Yu almost fell onto his knees: \u201c\u2026\u2026.What are you doing?\u201dYou Huo completed the ninth one in an instant and answered without looking up: \u201cGetting prepared.\u201dThis terrifying preparation of his continued until the sand inside the hourglass was fone.As soon as the black widow returned, she was met with sixteen dolls. Her old face instantly turned stiff.She had been doing this exam for a long time and it was her first time meeting such a guest. For a moment, she was at loss for words.She looked at You Huo as if he had gone mad.After a while, the black widow muttered something and proceeded to slowly place the sixteen dolls onto the wooden frame.\u00b7Night came faster than the previous two days.Whilst the villagers haven\u2019t entered their homes, they went across the frozen river to find them.\u201cYou\u2019re still here\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d The female villager held a tub of crushed ice and greeted them.But the contents of her greeting weren\u2019t something you wanted to hear.Old Yu who acted under Master You\u2019s instructions spoke straightforwardly: \u201cSister, I want to ask you something.\u201dThe female villager hesitated for a moment and asked: \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI heard that there is a tradition here and funerals can only be done at night?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cOh, then do you do traditional burial or cremation?\u201d Old Yu asked.The woman was stunned for a moment. For some reason, she appeared a little dazed.Soon, she tilted her head slightly and seemed to be looking somewhere in the woods.She then quickly returned to normal and replied blankly: \u201cBurial. We don\u2019t cremate. We can\u2019t cremate.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d You Huo suddenly interrupted.The woman tilted her head and thought for a moment: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason. The tradition is that the dead cannot be cremated.\u201dYou Huo hummed.Old Yu again asked: \u201cThen when you bury the coffin\u2026\u2026where do they usually get buried?\u201dWoman: \u201cIn the woods.\u201d\u201cI know it\u2019s in the woods.\u201d Old Yu internally thought: Isn\u2019t that obvious?He asked explained patiently: \u201cWhat I mean is, aren\u2019t there places in the woods that are already occupied? I just wanted to know where it is that\u2019s emptier and could still hold more coffins. You surely don\u2019t just randomly pick a place each time?\u201d\u201cOh, we don\u2019t do that.\u201d The woman thought for a moment and pointed to the east and west: \u201cThat place, and that one. Both are still empty.\u201dEveryone hastily noted it down.Old Yu wanted to ask more questions, but the woman looked at the sky and said: \u201cIt\u2019s getting dark now. I have to hurry back. You should also go back. Don\u2019t run around and don\u2019t enter the woods.\u201dAfter saying that, she picked up the tub and hurried back.Following the sound of the door closing, the village once again became silent.Please read this from kk translatesOld Yu said with frustration: \u201cWith that courage, they hold a funeral at night\u2026\u2026\u2026.Do you think the system is just speaking nonsense? These villagers don\u2019t even dare come out at night so how can they go in the woods for a funeral?!\u201d\u201cThe question said it so it must be the case. How can a place like this be understood using common sense?\u201d Chen Bing mumbled.In any case, at least they now know the location for the next burial.When someone ends up getting punished and put inside a coffin, they would at least have an idea where to start searching.\u00b7After saying farewell to the villagers, everyone did not return to their own house.You Huo\u2019s house had unknowingly become their base camp. Everyone gathered there.The sky grew darker.As they gnawed on dried bread, they discussed what they should do at night.\u201cIf we want to enter the woods, it\u2019s best to bring along some tools.\u201d Yu Wen raised his hand and proposed: \u201cOn one hand it can be used to defend yourself and on the other hand\u2026..What if you get lucky and catch another ghost arm?\u201d\u201cI found ropes in the room and there should be knives in each of the houses. I just don\u2019t know if they win over that bone-cleaver.\u201d Old Yu said: \u201cAlso, if we want to dig, we should bring along a shovel too right?\u201dHe turned his head as he said this to seek affirmation from You Huo.Unexpectedly, the single sofa behind him was empty. You Huo who was sitting there had disappeared.\u201cWhere is he? He was there earlier\u2026\u2026.\u201d Old Yu asked with confusion.Everyone looked towards the empty sofa.The room fell into silence for a while and it suddenly exploded.\u201cFuck?!\u201d Yu Wen anxiously looked for him. He called for his brother, \u201cBrother? Where are you?\u201dHe called out three times in a row but received no response.The most terrible thing was that Qin Jiu was still there.During an exam, whereever You Huo went, his personal invigilator must also follow.The only exception was\u2026\u2026..when undergoing the systems punishment.They suddenly recalled Qin Jiu\u2019s words in the morning: \u201cIt is likely that one moment you may be chatting face to face and the next moment one of you is gone.\u201dNo one in their right minds expected the system\u2019s random selection to be so coincidental and would actually send their golden thigh away.\u00b7At this moment, the golden thigh was lying inside a very small and confined space.He couldn\u2019t straighten his legs nor could he raise his hands very high. The oxygen there was also very limited.Needless to know, he was the lucky guy \u201crandomly selected to enter the coffin\u201d.He wasn\u2019t surprised by this outcome, or to be more precise, he wasn\u2019t surprised by this kind of outcome. Afterall, when sewing the dolls in the afternoon, he had already thought of two kinds of preparations.If someone else entered the coffin, he could reluctantly use the help card.If he himself entered the coffin\u2026\u2026then maybe he could save the use of the help card.In the dark, You Huo tried to get a feel of the coffin walls. It was damp and cold, and he could smell the thick smell of mud.He guessed that the coffin was probably buried under some mud in the woods.With the woods being so large, even if you have narrowed down the range, it was still equivalent to trying to find a needle in a haystack.Humans finding humans. That was always very difficult.But\u2026\u2026. This wouldn\u2019t be the case if it was something else finding humans.\u00b7In the woods on the east side, Old Yu and the others searched around whilst holding a fire torch and a bundle of rope.Suddenly, their footsteps stopped.Old Yu nervously gestured for them to be quiet.The others held their breaths and heard the familiar crawling sounds.But the sounds tonight were a little different. It didn\u2019t seem to be crawling towards the village and was instead\u2026\u2026.going deeper into the woods.After a few seconds, Yu Wen whispered: \u201cShit\u2026\u2026..Look over there!\u201dHe pointed ahead.Everyone looked over and immediately went crazy.More than a dozen pale ghostly arms and legs swarmed over from all directions and gathered at a certain open space up ahead.They all carried bone-cleavers of all size and shapes as they asked eerily, \u201cDid you sew a doll today?\u201dYou Huo who was buried six feet under answered: \u201cI did alright. I sewed sixteen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe ghost arm and legs fell silent for a moment. The knifes then smashed down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: The Villagers SecrePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaytChen Bin still held some psychological trauma towards these things so when he suddenly saw a large group of them, he was scared stiff.\u201cWhat is happening here?!\u201d\u201cDid they mention sewing dolls just now?\u201d Yu Wen hid behind a tree and watched them, \u201cNone of us sewed anything this afternoon. The only one who sewed was my brother?!\u201dHe quietly gasped, \u201cThose things are looking for my brother! He must be over there!\u201dOld Yu finally understood what You Huo meant by \u2018getting prepared\u2019.No wonder he sewed the dolls\u2026.He had planned ahead and marked himself first so that ghosts would come and find him if he was selected to enter the coffin.He even felt that one wasn\u2019t enough and made sixteen of them.Was he regarding those monsters as dogs?Oh, that\u2019s not right. It isn\u2019t just dogs.He was practically using them as living excavators.Influenced by their eagerness, the excavators were particularly efficient.The blades glistened in the moonlight and they didn\u2019t seem to feel tired no matter how much they dug. After a few moments, the wet mud in the area had been turned inside out.Everyone watched on in daze.Fortunately, they didn\u2019t stand there in daze the whole time.Please read this from kk translatesOld Yu held the rope and swallowed fearfully as he looked at the bright knife blades, \u201cThat\u2019s my nephew. I can\u2019t just stand around and do nothing. You guys\u2026\u2026.I won\u2019t ask for much but in a moment I\u2019ll go\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s also me!\u201d Yu Wen said.Chen Bin looked over. Every time the blades glistened, he trembled in fear.He slapped his face to motivate himself and whispered, \u201cAlthough\u2026.although I didn\u2019t act as a group with you before, I\u2019m not someone with a bad heart. With so many monsters, just the two of you won\u2019t be enough to suppress them. Don\u2019t count me out\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone agreed enthusiastically.Old Yu nodded, \u201cOkay then! Then after a while, we\u2019ll do this\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dIf they couldn\u2019t fight it, they should take advantage of the moment the opponent is at its weakest.Moreover, as the saying goes, \u201cthose who have nothing to lose are the scariest\u201d. Those arms and legs didn\u2019t have anything to lose so you could imagine how crazy they could get.Old Yu brought out the skills he had learnt from back in his younger days and made a loop with the rope.\u201cYou can do this?\u201d Chen Bin was surprised.\u201cDon\u2019t think of me as just an alcoholic. I\u2019ve also trained myself twenty years ago.\u201d Old Yu chortled.But he had been drinking for many years and his fingers were no longer as dexterous. His act of knotting the rope was rather clumsy.\u201cOkay, okay stop bragging. Your stomach is almost bigger that Sister Yao\u2019s.\u201d Yu Wen hated it the most when his father mentions anything about alcohol. He grabbed the remaining rope over and quickly tied it up.The method was obviously the same, but he was much more skilled than Old Yu.\u201cYou can too?\u201d Yu Yao asked softly.\u201cI taught him!\u201d Old Yu was a little proud and a little emotional, \u201cI taught him when he was young. I didn\u2019t think that he would still remember.\u201dYu Wen rolled his eyes.He made a knot in a few seconds and very quickly finished knotting up all the ropes.\u201cHere, hold this end and throw it over. Have you seen things like this on TV before?\u201d Yu Wen demonstrated it and then distributed the rope to the others. \u201cAccuracy is important.\u201dThis classmate had not worked hard his whole life and was completely hopeless in exams, but he was able to achieve high scores in things like darts and archery. Since a young age, he had been playing hoops with Old Yu and had become very skilled in his aiming ability.Apart from his face, he was basically able to date in high school because of this skill of his.The old man received the rope and tugged at it, \u201cLater, we will use these to catch those legs. Their centre of gravity is unstable so they should be easy to get. It\u2019s also not as scary as the arms\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Wen muttered, \u201cWeren\u2019t there a few heads? We could just smash it over after catching them.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dSuddenly, everyone fell silent for a few seconds.They realised suddenly that\u2026\u2026..they were actually discussing how they should hit the exam subject.\u201cNo matter.\u201d Old Yu gritted his teeth, \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens later. If worst comes to worse, we can just run!\u201d\u00b7In the blink of an eye, You Huo\u2019s coffin had emerged and the ground around him trembled.He knew that as soon as the lid was off, multiple knifes would pummel down.Dozens of bone-cleavers fell onto the coffin lid like heavy rain causing sawdust to scatter around.The corners of the coffin lid that was nailed shut instantly loosened. The coffin was unable to withstand the large amount of force exerted onto it and cracks formed. Fresh air leaked in through those cracks.You Huo stretched his body a little and quickly knocked one side of the coffin down before rolling out.Within a few seconds, he had managed to steal a knife from one of them. As he got ready to fight, those ghost arms and legs suddenly stopped their movements. The knives that they held couldn\u2019t reach him.You Huo looked carefully and saw that they were all bound by rope.The other ends of the rope were held firmly by the others, stopping them from venturing any further ahead.\u201cBrother!!\u201d Yu Wen and the others jumped out from behind the tree.You Huo grabbed the rope from them and, whilst the arms and legs were in confusion, he quickly tied them up and seized their weapons.\u00b7This twist happened almost instantaneously.Despite their great victory, they were all covered in cuts and bruises.Yu Wen and Chen Bin weren\u2019t strong enough and ended up rolling around the ground for a while as they wrestled with the ghost arm so their faces and necks were all scratched up.Old Yu\u2019s arm had bumped into a tree causing it to be a little dislocated.You Huo held the ropes and walked out. Yu Wen anxiously called out, \u201cYour hand!\u201dBright red blood flowed down from his forearm onto the back of his hand before staining his fingers and falling to the ground.Everyone who saw it was startled.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just a cut.\u201dYou Huo shook his hand causing the blood to scatter across the ground.That wound wasn\u2019t deep, but it was rather large. It was probably a wound caused by the knife when he snatched it.He took off his muddy coat and used the inside of it to wipe off the blood.\u201cWhy are you like this?! You should at least treat it.\u201d Old Yu tried to persuade You Huo while he gritted his teeth and realigned his arm.It was currently in the middle of winter and the temperature was very low. The blood exuding out from the wound quickly coagulated into a line.\u201cThe blood stopped.\u201d You Huo stretched his arm out and showed it to him. He clearly had no intention to treat it.Old Yu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dAfter angering his uncle, You Huo was about to walk away but when he looked up, his line of sight met with the invigilators gaze.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d You Huo asked.He had just been stuffed inside a coffin and had also lost a bit of blood, so his face was paler than usual. Even the light from the fire torch couldn\u2019t warm his complexion up. Instead, it made his earring appear even more dazzling to the eye.Qin Jiu\u2019s eyes seemed to move from his arm and then briefly to his earring.He held up a scarf in his hand and said: \u201cNothing. I originally wanted to demonstrate some care for the examinees and lend you a temporary gauze, but it looks like it\u2019s not necessary now.\u201dYou Huo\u2019s lips moved a little.But he couldn\u2019t think of anything to say in response. Qin Jiu moved to put his scarf back on.You Huo\u2019s eyes briefly swept across the front of his shirt.Despite the piercingly cold winter wind, the first two buttons of his shirt were unbuttoned.He watched Qin Jiu stuff the end of the scarf inside his coat collar and felt that this man was really strange.Over the past few days, he had come to know that Qin Jiu wasn\u2019t afraid of the cold, but he still liked to wrap himself with a scarf.He didn\u2019t wrap it properly and just habitually used it to cover the first of his shirt.Please read this from kk translatesYou Huo watched him for a moment before taking his eyes off the scarf, \u201cThe jacket can be thrown. If the blood stains the scarf, I would have to wash it and return it to you. Don\u2019t you know how difficult it is washing off blood?\u201dQin Jiu chuckled a little, \u201cI don\u2019t usually get hurt like this so I don\u2019t really know.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dLooks like he\u2019s taunting him.His expression turned cold and he turned to leave. Qin Jiu behind him suddenly asked, \u201cAre you planning on helping the system save the card? What were you going to do if those monsters came later in the evening? Suffocate to death?\u201dYou Huo internally commented: I\u2019m not mentally retarded.But on the surface, he just said \u201cOh, try and guess?\u201d\u00b7That night, despite being unable to answer the question, they had learned a lot.This time they made most of this opportunity and used the large group of arms and legs as guide dogs in the woods.The woods were still filled with fog, but they were prepared for this.The black widow had some rejuvenating tea in those rooms. Everyone had grabbed a handful and they desperately smelled it as they went to relieve them from dizziness and nausea.After about half an hour, those frantic arms and legs finally slowed down.They wandered around a barren field covered by grass and appeared to be trying to drill into the ground.Under the light from the fire torch, something that was dully shiny appeared deep amongst the dark mud.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cSeems to be a gravestone?\u201dEveryone cautiously approached it.You Huo used his feet to clean off the dirt before bending down.\u201cWhere\u2019s the fire?\u201dYu Wen and the others who were holding the fire torches moved closer.It was a flat gravestone. There were photos of the deceased, their cause of death and also an address.The reason why they could understand it so easily was because the words engraved on the gravestones were written in Chinese.The name was Zhao Wentu.Examination ticket number: 8651112091327745His friend Villager D missed him and had set up a grave for him in hopes that he could rest in peace.At the very bottom of the gravestone was information of the one who set up the gravestone.Villager D.Address: Chars Village, house number 4.In the woods, a cold and wet wind blew through bringing along a sharp whistle.Everyone\u2019s face was pale. They stood there in dead silence.On the gravestone was a photo of the dead examinee. He had big eyes, thick eyebrows and was filled with vitality. After looking at it more closely, they couldn\u2019t help but feel a faint sense of familiarity.If he grew a stubble, grew his hair out a little more and made it a little more messy, and then changed into some dirty and ragged old clothes\u2026..Then he would look like that crazy villager that claimed to have seen Qin Jiu before.As for house number 4 in Chars Village, the address of villager D, it just happened to also be that crazy man\u2019s house.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She had her hair in a high ponytail and wasn\u2019t smiling. She looked both refined and capable.If you let down her hair and messed it up a little, added a thick scarf, coupled that with a long winter coat that went down to her knees and also included a set of cracked, pale lips\u2026\u2026..It was that woman who was always smashing the ice by the river.Everyone\u2019s expression turned even more ugly.They stood there in silence for a moment. They then all began to dig.The third, fourth, fifth\u2026\u2026The area they searched grew broader and broader, and more and more gravestones were exposed. There were so many, they couldn\u2019t help but feel their scalp go numb.One after another, they uncovered familiar faces.For example, the two other villagers who regularly went to the river, and also the village chief\u2026\u2026Chen Bin\u2019s face was ghostly pale.He no longer needed to confirm it. He could clearly understand what was going on\u2014\u2014\u2013Those villagers who looked dull and lifeless were all once examinees.Those people who are now referred to as \u201cABCD\u201d were not originally NPC\u2019s of this village. They once had a name.You Huo squatted before a gravestone and looked up into the distance.From where they were, they couldn\u2019t see the ends of the woods.They couldn\u2019t spend the whole night here digging. Even if they didn\u2019t eat or sleep, they wouldn\u2019t be able to finish digging up this entire place.The number of people buried here would be a mystery even until the very end.\u2027Old Yu muttered in fear: \u201cWhat is this? Why did they become villagers? And\u2026\u2026and with so many graves here, if all the examinees became villagers then how could there only be eighteen households?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something here!\u201d Yu Yao suddenly called out.She knelt before Zhao Wentu\u2019s gravestone and held up a clear waterproof bag.\u201cWhere did you find it?\u201d You Huo walked over.\u201cIt was buried here.\u201d Yu Yao pointed to the ground.Her large belly made it inconvenient for her to move around, so she was slowly digging along the edge of Zhao Wentu\u2019s gravestone.She didn\u2019t have to dig long to uncover this waterproof bag.Please read this from kk translates\u201cIt\u2019s probably something left behind by Zhao Wentu.\u201d Yu Yao said.You Huo opened the waterproof bag and took out the book. Just as he was about to open it, he paused.He looked down at Zhao Wentu\u2019s gravestone and said: \u201cBorrowing it to take a look.\u201dHe said this very quietly, like a casual grunt. No one heard him apart from the invigilator who was forced to follow him around.Hearing his words, Qin Jiu\u2019s eyes flickered slightly. He looked at him for a while.The young man on the gravestone continued to smile.\u2027With a quick skim, you could tell instantly that it was Zhao Wentu\u2019s diary.More precisely, it was a record of his experiences during the examination.You Huo skipped over the others and turned directly to the contents mentioning this exam.\u2027-Day 1 of Foreign Language. Sunny.-This time we were very lucky and didn\u2019t manage to get English!There are not many Gypsy speakers left in this world anymore, yet this damned system dared to examine us on it. But it also wasn\u2019t unreasonable. There\u2019s this girl in the team who seems to know a little.I think saying \u201clittle\u201d is being too humble. At the very least, she was able to translate very well for the listening part of the exam.That girl wrote down the black widow\u2019s name on the spot. Damn impressive!She said that the name \u201cfloure\u201d meant flower. It\u2019s pretty nice\u2026\u2026Alright, I really have nothing else to say about that.Except for her, the other teammates don\u2019t seem very reliable (I hope that I can soon come back and slap myself in the face for saying this). It might also be because my expectations were too high. Afterall, you don\u2019t always get lucky and get teamed up with those godsend teammates.The villagers said that we would need to draw a card to be able to enter the black widow\u2019s house (Thank you ex-girlfriend for teaching me about tarot cards and making me memorise the meanings behind the entire set of cards. I didn\u2019t expect something like this to actually be useful later on.) Unfortunately by luck was bad and I drew the hanging man\u2026..In the afternoon, we were locked in the house and spent almost half the day sewing dolls. Manual labour was the death of me, so I only managed to sew an arm and a leg.I\u2019m a little worried. I don\u2019t know what the intention behind these dolls were but it probably wasn\u2019t a good thing.It is now nine o\u2019clock at night. I should go sleep. Sweet dreams.PS: This village is really strange.-Day 2 of Foreign Language. Cloudy.-Someone died. Two of them.One had their limbs cut off because of the dolls.I knew there was something wrong with sewing the dolls. If you didn\u2019t sew, you die, but if you sewed the most, you would be cut up. With so much fucking blood and the body missing, what difference was it between this and death?That unlucky teammate was still very young and seemed to still be in high school. We only met yesterday but I remember him saying that his father\u2019s name was Lin and his mother\u2019s name was Tang so he was called Lin Tang.Sigh\u2026\u2026..The scene was too bloody. I don\u2019t want to recall it or remember it.The other one was forced to enter the coffin because of an incorrect answer.Our answer for the second listening question was wrong, but how could it be wrong? I really don\u2019t get it\u2026\u2026The girl translated the entire speech spoken by the black widow for us. She said that the previous village chief was too foolish and disapproved of the black widow\u2019s involvement with the dead. He ostracised her for many years until her husband and children died (I suspect the village chief probably asked someone to do it and later the black widow killed him in retaliation?). She said she buried her entire family in the east part of the woods and had since become addicted to making dolls as a form of mental rehabilitation. The dolls helped convey her feelings, and through this she remembered her family.The girl wrote east part of the woods and also included grave as a precaution, but it was actually wrong!I don\u2019t get it. Now I want to go and take a look at the east part of the woods, but the villagers had warned us that we must not enter the woods. They seemed to be particularly afraid of that place. Having learnt our lesson from last night, this time everyone agreed to saw the same amount. We all only sewed the left arm so that there won\u2019t be anyone who has sewn more.It is now eight o\u2019clock at night. Soon there will be a meeting to discuss the answer to the next question. Sweet dreams.PS: I still find this village weird, especially those villagers. The girl said that the Gypsy inscription outside the village meant \u201cBlack Earth\u201d. Black could be associated with death and it\u2019s also the same black in black widow.So this was probably also \u201cThe Land of the Dead.\u201d-Day 3 of Foreign Language. Cloudy.-Another teammate died.It was because of those dolls.It was useless even if we sewed the same amount. They actually calculated by including the amount sewn on the first day too. Then that means I\u2019ve sewn a total of two arms and one leg?The only good thing was that we managed to answer correctly today.Please read this from kk translatesThe black widow\u2019s letter of blessing was very long. The girl could only understand a small portion of it. Along with some guesses, we felt that one of the dolls wearing black clothes looked a little like villager A. The letter of blessing said that we should stand at the door, knock three times and say, \u201cI have a gift for you\u201d. We were not allowed to get it wrong. We did as it said, and the door really opened. But the moment villager A saw the doll, he instantly went crazy.Forget it, I\u2019m not going to write about all the fights and conflicts. It\u2019s too tiring. It\u2019s enough just to be alive.Today everyone discussed again and decided to ensure that everyone has sewn the same amount.It is now eight o\u2019clock at night. Soon we will be having another meeting to discuss the next answer\u2026\u2026. But with fewer and fewer people, it can no longer be called a meeting.-Day 4 of Foreign Language-Another died.We all sewed the same amount so the one who is targeted was randomly selected.Also, another terrible thing happened.The person living in villager A\u2019s house had changed. The new one turned out to be Lin Tang who had died on the first day.It really was Lin Tang, not someone who resembled him. Even the mole was exactly the same.He looked very dazed and would dig for ice together with the other villagers. The scariest thing was that he didn\u2019t recognise us anymore and no longer remembered his name.He said his name was villager A. The previous villager had left, and he had only moved in today.Then\u2026\u2026does that mean that you are freed once you receive a doll? And the examinees who were killed would replace them as the new villagerIt is now seven o\u2019clock at night. There are only three of us left.I think\u2026..I probably won\u2019t be able to get through this exam. Although I have mentally prepared myself for this with every exam, it is still a little sad thinking about it.I hope that girl would be able to live a little longer. We have troubled her too much in this exam.If there is a 1 in 10,000 chance and we are able to successfully pass\u2026\u2026\u2026.I hope to see her again at another city. At that time, I would change my self-introduction and try to get to know her again.Alright, I\u2019m probably just being too wishful.-Day 5 of Foreign Language.-I was cut, but I was resurrected.I still have my arms and legs, but it feels strange to touch, like cotton.If this was what it meant to be alive\u2026\u2026..I can no longer remember what happened yesterday.While there\u2019s still time, I need to dig a grave.I hope I can remember who I am after digging one.I wish her sweet dreams.My name is Zhao Wentu.My name is Zhao Wentu\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2027The actual diary came to an abrupt stop here. The last entry showed signs of incoherence.On the reverse side of this entry were the words, \u201cMy name is Zhao Wentu\u201d filling the page. As it was written, the words became more and more awkward and crooked.At the very last line, there was only one word: \u201cMy\u201d.\u2027After reading Zhao Wentu\u2019s diary, everyone\u2019s heart went cold.Judging from the contents of the diary, the gravestone was probably set up by Zhan Wentu himself.He had constantly repeated his name as he stood there in desperate attempt to make himself remember it a little longer.But the moment he wrote \u201cRest in peace\u201d, he had become villager D and he no longer remembered anything.Occasionally, he would suddenly feel that he did not belong there, and he would also suddenly feel that a visitor appeared familiar, but he could never explain why.As a result, he had become known as the crazy man.When the ghost limbs cut them up, they said that obedient guests could live, while disobedient ones could only die?Could this still be considered living?The severing of the arms and legs was like a curse. Cursed examinees would become villagers and be forever bound to this village whilst bearing the name of villager ABCD until the day an examinee gives them the correct doll.At that time, they could finally truly pass on\u2026\u2026It was no wonder those villagers were so afraid of the black widow. It was because they also used to be examinees.No wonder they were reluctant to enter the woods. It was because their own graves were there.\u2027You Huo finished reading the final page and closed the diary expressionlessly.He shoved the diary back into the waterproof bag and intended to bury it back in place, but he eventually changed his mind.Holding the bag, he said: \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d \u201cGo where?\u201d Everyone had not yet recovered from their emotions. They were very confused.You Huo: \u201cI don\u2019t want to take the test anymore. Gifting all the dolls out tonight.\u201dThe words \u201cgifting the dolls\u201d were spoken by this great master, but his expression said \u201cbomb the exam\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31: Burn the ExamPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFrom their previous experience, they learnt that they didn\u2019t need to complete all the questions provided during the exam.As long as the examinee can bear the consequences of not writing down an answer such as not earning any points, non-critical ones could be skipped.There were three methods one could end an exam: One was total annihilation; another was when you run out of time and the last method was answering the key question(s) early.The key question of the hunter was finding that special set of tableware.The key question here was the reading question \u2014\u2014 Gifting out the dolls and finding your way home.Previously, Yu Wen had thought that it would take them a long time to gift the dolls out.Like how it was recorded in Zhao Wentu\u2019s diary, everyone would gather together, try and blindly guess the correct owner of each doll and then carefully complete a small portion of the task each day.He never expected this golden thigh of his to think that it was too slow and he even wanted to finish it in one night.Eighteen households in one night?What kind of joke is this\u2026\u2026..It wasn\u2019t because they didn\u2019t believe in You Huo, they just had no idea where to start.\u2027When they returned to their house, it was late at night.You Huo\u2019s room was still in the same state as it was when they left. The only difference was that the water on the coffee table had cooled down and the edges of the dry bread had turned white, making it even more unpalatable. The fire in the room was still burning well in the furnace.You Huo wandered around the sofa and suddenly asked: \u201cWhere\u2019s the sack?\u201d\u201cSack? What sack?\u201dThe others didn\u2019t understand.Just as You Huo wanted to add \u201cthe one with the dolls\u201d, he saw Qin Jiu indicate to the furnace with his chin.Everyone looked over.On the woollen rug next to the fire, a grey sack laid on the ground. One of the dolls inside had fallen out and it fell right next to the fire.If the fire was just a little stronger, it would have been burned.\u201cHow did it end up there?!\u201d Yu Wen hurried over and picked up the sack and the doll.You Huo pointed to the sofa and said: \u201cIt was there before. Who moved it?\u201dEveryone looked at each other but no one could answer his question.Old Yu said, \u201cWhen we found out that you were sent to enter the coffin, we rushed out after grabbing the rope. Maybe someone placed it wrongly because they were in a hurry?\u201dBut they all recalled carefully, and they were certain they didn\u2019t touch it.Could it be that\u2026\u2026\u2026It can move on its own?Just the thought of it was strange. No one dared to think any further.Yu Wen muttered: \u201cIf one got burnt and we don\u2019t have the right numbers, we would have been in trouble.\u201dHe picked up the doll by its leg: \u201cIt was so close. Look, there\u2019s a patch here.\u201d\u201cAnd here too. Even half of the clothes\u2014\u2014-\u201d Yu Wen turned the doll around.You Huo interrupted him: \u201cThose two places were there originally.\u201dYu Wen stopped: \u201cHuh?\u201dThat doll was one of the last four added by the black widow. You Huo recalled seeing burn patches on it at that time.\u201cThat being said, does that mean that it was almost burnt before?\u201d Yu Wen held onto the doll and said: \u201cWhy does it encounter so many disasters? Does this count as a clue? Who in the village has been burnt before?\u201dYu Yao said: \u201cZhao Wentu.\u201dEveryone was stunned for a moment. Even You Huo turned to look at her.Yu Yao felt uncomfortable being watched: \u201cUh\u2026\u2026.I\u2019m meant villager D.\u201dShe felt bad calling someone \u201ccrazy\u201d and said with a red face: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a little too concerned with cleanliness, I always notice it if other people\u2019s clothes are not clean. He had a lot of ashes on his sleeves and on the sides of his clothes. The back of his shirt was also a little burnt. It might not necessarily mean that he was burnt before, but I just thought\u2026\u2026\u2026maybe.\u201dWhen she was done speaking, she kept quiet again. She sat there with a completely red face.\u201cThat makes sense!\u201d Yu Wen looked at the doll and said: \u201cIf there are really those traces, then it must be him!\u201dYou Huo made a sound of agreement.When he nodded, everyone was instantly relieved.This kind of scene was like that moment when a study slag checks their answer with a study god. If they happened to have the same answer, they would be pleased because they were certain they would be fine.\u2027Zhao Wentu had mentioned in his diary that they gave the doll to villager A because they felt that the doll resembled him.So the key to giving these gifts out was to find the similarities between the dolls and the villagers. Each doll would represent a villager.\u201cI suddenly feel like I\u2019m playing a game\u2026\u2026\u201d Yu Wen held the sack of dolls in his left hand and shook the doll in his right hand: \u201cGuess who I am?\u201d\u201cThen guess.\u201d Old Yu pointed at him, \u201cPut it down and don\u2019t fool around!\u201d\u2027The dolls were lined up and everyone sat around it.After staring at it for a full minute, they exploded.Guess what?!Except for Zhao Wentu\u2019s doll which had been burned and had obvious differences from the other dolls, the other dolls had no unique characteristics at all. The minor differences were negligible, and they all shared a common point: Ugly.A couple of threads in the cloth and they dared to say that those were the eyes and nose. If you covered it with a piece of cloth, it was considered clothes.Holding this and saying to the villagers \u201cthis is you\u201d \u2013 Are you trying to piss them off?\u201cAre there any birthmarks?\u201d Chen Bin raised his hand and asked with embarrassment: \u201cCan\u2026..we take off the clothes?\u201d\u201cAre they going to fight you if you take of its clothes?\u201d Old Yu had a glum expression: \u201cBut there\u2019s a problem. Even if there are birthmarks under the clothes, are you going to go around stripping all the villagers?\u201dChen Bin: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesAlthough it was spoken quite harshly, he was right.What\u2019s more, those villagers locked themselves in the house all day and wouldn\u2019t come out.Zhao Wentu said that they would only open the door if you knocked on their door three times and said \u201cI have a gift for you\u201d.But once that door was opened, the examinees would need to gift out the correct doll. No mistakes were allowed.Everyone looked at the dolls in silence. They once again deeply felt confused\u2014\u2014How the fuck do we do that?\u2027\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d You Huo suddenly spoke up.Everyone looked at him. They then looked at Qin Jiu.Qin Jiu took out his phone: \u201cTwo in the morning. There\u2019s still about five and a half hours left.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cAre you sure?\u201dYou Huo drank some water and made a sound of affirmation. He then swept all the dolls into the sack.He looked around the room and pointed at a few things: \u201cRope, knife, cloth. Take those and whatever else you find.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dEveryone did as he said.They got everything ready and followed You Huo out the door before asking: \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201dYou Huo said: \u201cRobbery.\u201dEveryone: \u201c???\u201dQin Jiu suddenly laughed.That deep voice of his sounded close to his ear. It made those hearing it feel uncomfortable.\u201cGo over there and laugh.\u201d You Huo turned his head away with a stiff expression. He then said to the others, \u201cDon\u2019t waste time. Are you coming or not?\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Coming, coming.\u201d\u2027Soon, they stood in front of a small house.The sign on the door read: \u201c4 Chars Village\u201d.Knock, knock, knock.You Huo knocked on the door: \u201cI have a gift for you.\u201dEveryone held their breaths and waited. Rustling could be heard from behind the door.It was probably the sound of footsteps, but it sounded like cloth rubbing against the floor.Everyone recalled the contents of Zhao Wentu\u2019s diary. He had mentioned that although he had arms and lefts, they were soft to the couth, like it was stuffed with cotton\u2026\u2026\u2026It was both scary and sad.With a creak, the door opened.Zhao Wentu poked his head out. His face displayed signs of aging and his expression was dull. The white hairs mixed in in dark hair seemed to glisten a little under the moonlight.His black eyes stared at You Huo without blinking. He asked slowly: \u201cWhat gift?\u201dYou Huo took out the waterproof bag and the burnt doll: \u201cA diary and also a doll of you. It\u2019s called Zhao Wentu.\u201dThe overlooking moonlight stretched his shadow out. It fell over Zhao Wentu\u2019s face.He stood under the light and shadow for a long time. His eyes then finally revealed a small light.\u201cZhao\u2026\u2026.Wen\u2026\u2026\u2026..Tu\u2026.\u201d He looked at the humble doll and repeated that name slowly. Because he hadn\u2019t said it for a long time, his pronunciation of it was a bit rusty.\u201cZhao Wentu\u2026\u2026\u201d He repeated it again.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026He stood there muttering the same words numerous times. Suddenly, he started laughing out loud and bowing forward.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me he\u2019s crazy again?\u201d Old Yu asked with worry.Zhao Wentu didn\u2019t hear him.He laughed for a long time, and then he started to cry. Finally, he snatched the two gifts, pushed away You Huo and the others and rushed into the woods. In a blink of an eye, he had disappeared.\u201cDoes this count as\u2026\u2026..freeing him? Where is he going?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d You Huo walked away. It was as if he didn\u2019t care much about the outcome.\u2027In a blink of an eye, they stood before another house.This time it was 1 Chars Village, the house of villager A.Everyone stood there with a complex expression. They stopped talking.They had never seen this villager before so how were they going to match the villager with a doll?Let them pick it out randomly from the sack?Just as they were about to retreat, You Huo knocked on the door.\u201cOpen the door, I have a gift.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dOkay, it\u2019s too late now.Everyone looked on numbly as the door opened. A villager they had not seen before asked You Huo: \u201cWhat gift?\u201dYou Huo immediately responded with binding a rope around the villager\u2019s neck. He looped it around several times and bound the villager tightly.Villager A: \u201c???\u201dEveryone instantly collapsed: It really was robbery\u2026..You Huo tightened the ropes and placed the other end in Yu Wen\u2019s hand: \u201cDon\u2019t let go. If you lose it, you\u2019re dead.\u201dYen Wen held onto the rope and looked at villager A with similarly confused expressions. He didn\u2019t know what to do.By the time everyone returned to their senses, You Huo was already standing at the door to villager B\u2019s house.Before everyone\u2019s eyes, he once again raised that sinful hand of his and said: \u201cOpen the door, I have a gift.\u201dSoon afterwards, there was another person in Old Yu\u2019s hands.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2027Half an hour.In just half an hour, they had ransacked the entire village.There was a total of nineteen people in the eighteen households. Excluding Zhao Wentu who had already ran off in a crazy state, they others were all in their hands. This even included the village chief and his elderly mother.This was the most outrageous greeting ever received by the villagers in Chars Village.They found an empty space by the river and gathered the villagers there under You Huo\u2019s instructions.\u201cAnd then?\u201d Old Yu asked.He then saw You Huo pick up the sack and pour out all the dolls. He pushed them over before the group of villagers: \u201cWe have brought the black widow\u2019s gift.\u201dVillagers: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cSomething like this is okay?\u201dThe eyes of Old Yu and the others were about the protrude out. But they then thought about it: \u201cThat\u2019s true, the question didn\u2019t specifically say that they had to gift it out individually.\u201dThere was complete silence by the river.Then all the villagers went crazy.\u2027The dolls ended up in their hands and it ripped apart that earlier illusion of peace.The villagers started to scream and struggle around. With them losing their senses, they suddenly became a lot stronger.They broke free from the ropes and rushed forward, attacking everyone in sight.Their crazy act was completely different to Zhao Wentu\u2019s. Everyone was caught off guard by this and weren\u2019t able to hold them back.Although they had brought knives, it was only used for threatening. Now that they knew that the villagers were once examinees like them, they didn\u2019t have the heart to harm them.Please support the translator and read this fromkktranslates(.)home(.)blogAmidst the chaos, there was suddenly movement coming from the woods.The sound of crawling came from all directions.You Huo looked back and his pupils instantly constricted.The ghost hands that came out this time wasn\u2019t just one or two. It also wasn\u2019t a dozen\u2026\u2026.Everyone who had been buried six feet under- all their severed limbs and body \u2013 they all emerged out from within the woods.It wouldn\u2019t be too excessive describing this situation as exam uprising.Sharp screams rang. Everyone drew closer together and panicked.\u201cTake them into the woods!\u201d You Huo shouted.\u201cThe woods again? Why?!!!!\u201dDespite asking why, the group of people still did as they were told. They formed a circle and pushed their bodies to their absolute limits as they ran.The cold touch from the bone cleavers brushed past them numerous times. Each time, it would narrowly miss their faces and skin.All those \u201cnear misses\u201d were more terrifying than anything.Soon, they scattered in all directions like ripples in a pond.\u2027You Huo jumped over a fallen tree and examined his surroundings. He quickly calculated the density of the woods.Ever since Zhao Wentu ran into the woods, there had been one thought on his mind: In this place, what would be considered liberation?According to the diary, one could be freed following successful gifting of the dolls.But that was just Zhao Wentu\u2019s speculation. He was just an examinee at that time, so he only knew part of the truth. He just happened to see villager A go missing the next day after gifting him a doll, so he connected the two dots together.But looking at the situation now, there was clearly something important still missing.If not, they wouldn\u2019t be chased down like this.There must be something they had to do to quell the resentment and hatred held by these severed limbs. Only then, the examinees will be able to relax.You Huo had been constantly mulling over this problem.He then recalled the doll that had been burned by fire.Whether it\u2019s the doll or Zhao Wentu, why were burn marks appearing over and over again\u2026\u2026.Why did the villagers say that it was a tradition of Chars Village to bury, not cremate\u2026\u2026\u2026The more he thought about it, the more he felt that there was only one reason for this\u2014\u2014\u2013A burial would trap and bound them to this place while cremation would allow them to properly rest in peace.\u2027You Huo eyed several easily flammable locations and internally made his decision. He lured those arms and legs over to the burning nest and felt that time was right.Immediately, he stopped his steps. He reached inside his pocket intending to pull out his lighter and light up a nearby tree but the moment he reached inside, his eyebrows raised.Gone.His pocket was empty.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dMust have fallen out during the chaos earlier\u2026\u2026..But in some situations, even a one second pause would put one\u2019s life at risk.In just that time frame, countless horrible figures had already rushed over. They immediately surrounded him forming a circle.What was even more terrible was that there was also the thick fog from last time that induced drowsiness.\u2026\u2026\u2026.When the limbs started to take action, You Huo pressed his finger against a tree trunk and drew a few strokes.He did it faster than he could think about it.When he suddenly realised that what he was writing didn\u2019t seem to be 001, a sudden burst of fire enveloped those severed limbs.It was as if it was thrown into a pot of hot oil. The fire spread and scattered rapidly the moment it landed.The tangled trees here appeared to burn more easily than expected.In an instant, the woods were enveloped by a sea of fire.Countless pale severed limbs flew out from the fire before falling silently to the ground and disintegrating into dust.You Huo narrowed his eyes as he watched the fire. Bright reflections flicked against his light-coloured eyes. His gaze crossed over the fire and it fell over to a location out into the distance.There, invigilator 001 emptied the remaining contents of an oil barrel into the fire.The flames instantly surged in intensity. Under the bright lights, he strode over. There was a hint of arrogance lingering at the corner of his lips. It made his usually apathetic and lazy look seem a little livelier.Under the hands of this man, the entire examination centre had turned into a burning furnace. All the zombie limbs that were trapped in a never-ending cycle were smothered by this sea of fire.Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

From within that arrogance, there was also a hint of wildness.Admittedly, it was something that was very attractive to many.Despite clearly only knowing him for a few days, You Huo\u2019s instinctively had a strong thought.He felt that\u2026\u2026This was the moment that was closest to Qin Jiu\u2019s true nature. It was also much more pleasing to the eye.Qin Jiu stopped before him. From his pocket, he pulled out a lighter, \u201cI found this by the river. I wonder which not very well-behaved examinee is throwing things around?\u201dYou Huo\u2019s expression instantly turned cold. Internally he felt that he must have gone crazy. Pleasing to the eye my ass.Qin Jiu flicked the lighter causing a small flame to appear. He then blew it out and closed it.\u201cNo one wants it?\u201dYou Huo snatched it back. He coldly scowled, \u201cCan\u2019t you speak without provocation?\u201dQin Jiu laughed. He said modestly, \u201cBack at you.\u201dYou Huo\u2019s expression turned tense.He didn\u2019t want to give Qin Jiu anymore attention but a few seconds later he asked, \u201cDid you start such a big fire?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cNot necessarily. It could also be the examination centre spontaneously combusting.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeeing the great master\u2019s massive eyeroll, Qin Jiu laughed again, \u201cWho else would have the time to start such a big fire? If you must ask a question with such an obvious answer, I can only cooperate and answer you with an interesting answer.\u201dYou Huo ridiculed, \u201cThat must\u2019ve been hard on you.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..So when did you find the time? When I was gifting the dolls out by the river, you were still around.\u201d\u201cOh, you would need to thank those army of limbs. This time they weren\u2019t crazy enough to also chase after the exam invigilator.\u201d Qin Jiu looked around and said, \u201cYou all moved faster than rabbits and disappeared into the woods in a blink of an eye. I was bored and the doors to the houses just happened to be open so I went and looked around. On my way, I borrowed a few barrels of oil.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cAnd you poured it around the woods?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cA foolish trick.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe had only said it casually and it didn\u2019t mean that he really did that but there seemed to be a strange meaning behind Qin Jiu\u2019s words. This was particularly when he said the word \u201cfoolish\u201d and he just happened to glance at You Huo at the same time.He really was looking for death.Qin Jiu admired his stink-eye and he didn\u2019t seem to have any intention to stop his teasing, \u201cFoolish methods may be useful but it\u2019s boring. I don\u2019t like it.\u201dYou Huo also felt that it was boring, but he didn\u2019t say anything.Please read this from kk translates\u201cI was too lazy to circle the woods, so I just drenched the passing limbs in oil.\u201dThen, those severed limbs scattered out like dandelion seeds. It took along the oil and spread it in all directions.Whenever Qin Jiu found a barrel, he would pour it onto a nearby group. In total, twelve barrels were found and eleven and a half were poured out.Those severed limbs eventually understood that he didn\u2019t not have any good intentions and started to avoid him.So Mr. Invigilator took the last half barrel of oil into the woods with the thought that 'since it was open, he shouldn\u2019t waste it\u201d.You Huo finally could no longer hold himself back. He wondered, \u201cWith you pouring the oil out in advance, would that be violating the rules?\u201d\u201cAll invigilators should have the ability to predict and prepare in advance.\u201d Qin Jiu said.Having been an invigilator for so many years, he had been very accurate in his ability to predict when an examinee would ask for help.Making the necessary preparations in advance was something many invigilators would do to avoid being a step too late when the time comes.\u00b7Qin Jiu pulled out the help card from his coat pocket. With it sandwiched between his two fingers, he waved it around in front of You Huo, \u201cWith this card as a premise, how can it be considered as a violation?\u201d\u201cYou mean the help card has been used?\u201d You Huo asked doubtfully, \u201cHow can that be? I didn\u2019t write 001.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t write?\u201d Qin Jiu thought he was just too embarrassed to admit it. He laughed, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t write 001 then why would I be standing here?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cWho knows.\u201dQin Jiu narrowed his eyes, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t write 001\u2026\u2026then what did you write? It couldn\u2019t have been my name.\u201dYou Huo internally thought: Who knows your name? Don\u2019t be so narcissistic.He said stiffly, \u201cForget it. I wrote it in a haste. In any case, it wasn\u2019t you. If it was you, why has the help card not changed?\u201dAs he said that, the card in Qin Jiu\u2019s hand suddenly burst into flames. It had spontaneously lit up.The moment it turned into ashes, a crow nearby flapped its wings and perched onto a dead branch.It opened its beak and said with a rough voice: \u3010Examinee You Huo obtained a total of 1 help card, and have used 1. A total of 0 remains. \u3011You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dRubbish system.Qin Jiu spread open his hands, allowing the ashes of the card to fall through his fingers.\u201cSee? The system approves.\u201dSee your grandmother.You Huo maintained a handsome deadpanned expression and walked away with the lighter in his hands.He went to find the other examinees.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Behind Qin Jiu was the tree You Huo was supporting himself on. In the centre, there was a faint grey mark. It appeared to be stains left by a finger.If you examined it carefully, you could see that the grey marks formed two English letters: GIQin Jiu\u2019s eyes glanced over. Just as he was about to move closer, someone suddenly rushed out from the fire.\u2026\u2026\u2026.That person paused and stared at invigilator 001. His eyes swam around.His face revealed signs of haggardness and there were multiple rips in his clothes, making him look very pathetic but his eyes were still bright, like the stars during a winter night.It wasn\u2019t anyone else. It was Zhao Wentu who had run off madly earlier.After a long, long time, Zhao Wentu said, \u201cQin\u2026..Jiu? Qin Jiu?\u201dQin Jiu stopped. He furrowed his brows, \u201cDo you know me?\u201dZhao Wentu looked like he had just woken up, yet he also seemed like he was still stuck inside a dream from many years ago.He smiled. In that instant, he seemed to still possess the youth and vitality he once possessed like the photo at his gravestone: \u201cHow could I not know you? We went through three exams together. You may not remember me, but I remember you.\u201d\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d He sighed softly. He then added: \u201cWhat about that invigilator you\u2019re always against? Not here?\u201d\u201cWhich invigilator?\u201d Qin Jiu asked in a low voice.Zhao Wentu lowered his voice and moved closer: \u201cInvigilator A.\u201dHearing this title from another person\u2019s mouth, Qin Jiu frowned slightly. He couldn\u2019t tell whether he was in a good or bad mood.Zhao Wentu also said: \u201cWasn\u2019t your luck extremely bad such that you always end up in the same exam as him? Is he not here?\u201dQin Jiu didn\u2019t immediately burst the other party\u2019s dream state and just made a sound of acknowledgement.\u201cLong time no see. How many exams have you finished? Can you get out safely?\u201d Zhao Wentu finished saying this and then whispered: \u201cI probably asked a stupid question. You\u2019ll definitely have no problem passing. I on the other hand\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe turned around and looked at the sea of fire. He whispered: \u201cI can\u2019t do it\u2026\u2026..I can\u2019t get out. Even if I get out, it\u2019s pointless. I probably can no longer be considered human anymore.\u201dQin Jiu looked at the other party.Zhao Wentu stood there and watched the fire for a long time. He seemed to be trying to etch this scene into his memories.After a long time, he took something out from inside his clothes: \u201cI should go. Can you hold onto this for me?\u201dQin Jiu looked at the waterproof bag he handed over. The diary was still lying fully intact inside. In addition to that, there was also a dusty phone that clearly looked like it hadn\u2019t been used in a long time.\u201cI just remembered that I had hidden these for a long time.\u201d Zhao Wentu pointed to the phone and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to disappear completely. At least these will be able to prove that I once lived.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Okay.\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesZhao Wentu breathed a sigh of relief.\u201cI am Zhao Wentu.\u201d\u201cMy name is Zhao Wentu\u2026..\u201dHe laughed out loud. He then turned and ran back into the sea of fire.Qin Jiu held the waterproof bag and stood there for a while. It was like he was seeing off a distant friend.It wasn\u2019t until the fire came closer that he stowed away those items.\u2026\u2026..In the distance, there were sounds of people speaking.You Huo managed to find the others one after another. Qin Jiu had fortunately set the woods alight in time and no one had died.Fire was burning all over the place but the area they stood was fine.Perhaps the system left a small foothold for them so that they could hear the final results of the exams.The crows flew out from the several houses and perched in a row onto the dead branches above their heads.The moment Zhao Wentu\u2019s figure completely disappeared, they called out \u201cAhh\u201d and said:\u3010Examination centre has collapsed and cannot be recovered. Examination has been terminated. \u3011Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThis exam was divided into two parts.For the three listening questions, the total score was 15 points.Black widow\u2019s name (5 points)Where is the black widow\u2019s family? Please find them. (5 points)How many people are there in the black widow\u2019s house? (5 points)The two reading questions:Help the black widow send out her gifts (9 points)Find the way home (3 points)The black widow\u2019s name was 5 points, sending out gifts was 9 points and finding the way home was 3 points.It was Chen Bin\u2019s first time hearing a result like this. He was completely shocked. After a long time, he finally couldn\u2019t help but ask; \u201cWhen did we find the way home? I even suspected that there was no way home in the first place.\u201dYu Wen was the one who stretched his arm out and answered: \u201cIn a while after the fire is gone, will there be any more trees? Without the trees, everywhere is the way home!\u201dChen Bin: \u201c???????\u201dThe system continued to report the final examination results.The total points obtained by the examinees total 17 points, exceeding the average score of 12 points.The total time used was two and a half days. Compared to the average time used, 7 days and 5 hours were saved.Another high score!Another early paper submission!And they even destroyed the examination centre!Everyone was about to cheer when the examination system added:\u3010Examination centre was inflicted permanent damage. 5 points will be deducted from the examinee\u2019s total score. The total score is 12 points.\u3011You Huo tsked.\u3010Invigilator will be punished once.\u3011Qin Jiu: \u201cHah.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were high-rise buildings on both sides.The high-rise buildings were a bit old, like department stores from a century ago. The shop windows were grey and dusty, and the lights in the corners formed a ring of light around them.It was like a forgotten old city street.\u201cThis is a rest stop?\u201d Everyone grabbed onto the driver and didn\u2019t let him get back into the car.\u201cWhy are you grabbing me?\u201d The driver wasn\u2019t happy. He pried off their hands: \u201cThis is a rest stop. Can\u2019t you see that hotel over there?\u201dThe dilapidated minivan indeed stopped right before a hotel.The hotel had the typical look most common stores had. It was located at the corner of the street and appeared completely desolated.\u2026\u2026.Actually, it wasn\u2019t just that one. It was the same for the entire street.\u201cRest stops can change?\u201d Everyone was surprised.\u201cWhat about the small inn? Boss Chu? We only just managed to get acquainted with her.\u201d\u201cBoss Chu? Chu Yue?\u201d It may have been because of the lighting but the drivers\u2019 dark face appeared to turn a little red. He then quickly restored his expression: \u201cYou met her? She must still be in that small inn. There are five rest stops in total in the country and are often rotated.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cIn the country? This examination also happens overseas?\u201dThe driver pursed his lips.He didn\u2019t seem to want to speak any further but, for Chu Yue\u2019s sake, he finally said: \u201cOf course. Don\u2019t you have a foreigner standing there? Also, if there is a subject called foreign language, then there would naturally be examination centres overseas.\u201dThe examinees who had just left the village stared wordlessly at him.Driver: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYour situation was a rare case.\u201d He added.\u00b7You Huo looked around. Those high-rise buildings were brightly lit. It was as if it was filled with people.\u201cCan you choose the rest stop?\u201d He asked.The driver said: \u201cIt\u2019s generally random. Each of the five rest stops have their own special features\u2014\u2014\u201dYou Huo recalled the earlier rest stop and said expressionlessly: \u201cEspecially run-down?\u201dDriver: \u201c\u2026..Chu Yue\u2019s one is indeed a bit\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201dYou Huo\u2019s expression was cold.Driver: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026especially run-down.\u201d\u201cThat rest stop may be the only one without any merits.\u201d The driver frowned and mumbled: \u201cOtherwise, she wouldn\u2019t be sent there as punishment\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBut the others have their own advantages. Chu Yue\u2019s one is rest stop 1. Rest stop 2 is like a military base with all kinds of weapons. Whatever weapon you can think of, they will have it there. For some examinees, it is heaven.\u201d\u201cThe major feature at rest stop 3 is its casino. If you are lucky, you can give it a try. You may even get your hands on a guaranteed pass card. Rest stop 4 allows you to eat and play as much as you wanted to. Staying there for a few days would allow you to temporarily forget about the exams. And this place here is rest stop 5.\u201dYou Huo frowned. He had a bad feeling: \u201cAnd the advantage of this place?\u201dDriver: \u201cThe market is cheaper.\u201dEveryone: \u201cHow cheap?\u201d\u201c10-40% off.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dChen Bin couldn\u2019t help but say: \u201cIn all honesty, I can\u2019t even deduct 0.1 points right now.\u201dDriver: \u201cWhat a coincidence. Most examinees are just like you so coming here would be considered bad luck\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe lucky king You Huo turned his head and walked away.\u00b7Anyway, this rest stop was better than the previous one.They didn\u2019t want to use the adjective \u201cprosperity\u201d because it sounded rather ironic.In any case, even the management of the hotel was stricter.A scanner was installed on the automatic glass door and a red light swept across the examinees.With the principle of allowing the old, sick and frail to go first, You Huo leaned against the door and waited.He waited until everyone entered before following behind.Please read this from kk translatesThe moment he stepped through, the alarm went off.The woman at the front desk shot up. She stretched her neck out: \u201cWhat have you brought?\u201dYou Huo stopped his steps: \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dEveryone didn\u2019t understand what was going on, and they were worried about You Huo. They all stared at the front desk vigilantly.The woman at the front desk beckoned him over: \u201cI\u2019ll have to trouble you to come this way. I need to check.\u201dYou Huo threw the black bag onto the table and unzipped it. He raised his thin eyelid and said: \u201cCheck what? Go ahead.\u201dThat face of his was more impactful when seen up close.The woman went red from her neck to her face. She explained: \u201cUh\u2026..You can do it yourself. Please try and recall for a moment. Did you bring back anything from the examination centre?\u201dEveryone was confused.Yu Wen said: \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. There wasn\u2019t anything normal in that damned examination centre. Who in the right mind would take something from there? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a souvenir.\u201dThe woman at the front desk was amused by this: \u201cBut I can\u2019t rule out the possibility of something trying to slip out together with the examinees. I\u2019ve had it happen before, and it almost killed someone in the rest stop. It could be considered a reminder for us to reinforce security.\u201dEveryone internally commented: The previous rest stop didn\u2019t do these checks.But now that the alarm had gone off, they could only comply. Everyone just nodded and no longer made things hard for the front desk.That woman saw that they were easy to talk to and turned to You Huo while blushing: \u201cI know you didn\u2019t do it intentionally. How could a normal person do something like that? It\u2019s just a quick check to see if anything dangerous has secretly snuc\u2014\u2014-\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netYou Huo didn\u2019t even go through his belongings.

Just half a minute ago he was calling his brother \u2018not in the right mind\u2019.\u201cBrother, you\u2026\u2026.why did you bring back the black widow\u2019s doll?\u201d He mumbled in a quiet voice.You Huo: \u201cBy chance.\u201dYu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhat do you mean by chance?\u00b7In You Huo\u2019s hand was the black widow\u2019s doll.It wasn\u2019t the one he sewed himself, but a doll that was originally sitting on the bottom of the wooden frame. It was the doll with the bellflower pattern on its feet.Everyone had been tortured by these dolls for the past few days, so they felt traumatised when the saw the doll.Yu Yao and Chen Bin especially were ghostly pale.Who would have thought that the great master would take a walk around the examination centre and come back with a souvenir?You Huo asked the front desk: \u201cNot allowed to take them?\u201dFront desk: \u201cIt\u2019s mainly because we are concerned about examinees being faced with danger in the rest stop. If you really want it, you can keep it.\u201dYou Huo took the doll back again.Front desk: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAlright. You\u2019re the best.This woman no longer blushed. She tapped the keyboard and quickly pulled out a stack of cards which were then issued to each of them: \u201cThe rest time this time is five days. The room number is marked on the card. Please make sure you don\u2019t go to the wrong one to avoid disrupting the other examinees. The uppermost floor is the restaurant which is open 24 hours. Other daily necessities or examination required items can be purchased at the store. Five days later, which is the last day of your resting period, the store will have a big discount from 7-10am. Try not to miss it.\u201dYou Huo took the card and turned it over.Sure enough, the format was the same as last time.Name: You HuoExamination Ticket Number: 860451-10062231-000ACompleted subjects: Physics, Foreign Language (2/5)Total points: 27Yu Wen held his card and stood on the side scratching his head: \u201cThere is a problem with the scoring in these exams. You clearly answered the most questions and earned the most points, but in the end everyone got the same points.\u201dAnd You Huo also bought some things before. After going through the same two exams together, his total score was the lowest amongst them.\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d You Huo didn\u2019t look at it for long and just stuffed the card into his pocket.Chen Bin interjected: \u201cIt\u2019s not like this for every exam. At least one of the five exams will be scored separately. Whoever answers it will get the points. I\u2019ve experienced it before.\u201dYu Wen: \u201cAnd then? How many did you get?\u201dChen Bin answered grimly: \u201c3 points.\u201dEveryone was frightened by the news. No one spoke until they entered the elevator.\u00b7Their rooms were just below the restaurant upstairs, so it was very convenient.When everyone looked for their rooms, Old Yu suddenly said: \u201cWait, this isn\u2019t right.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s not right?\u201d\u201cThe dolls were given out to the villagers. If you brought one back, doesn\u2019t that mean that a villager didn\u2019t get their doll? Then why did we get full marks for that question?\u201dYou Huo said: \u201cExtra one.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dYou Huo raised the doll in his hand and said: \u201cThis one doesn\u2019t match with any of the villagers.\u201dEveryone was stunned. They then noticed the pattern on the doll\u2019s leg.\u201cWhen we were trying to figure out the differences between the dolls, this wasn\u2019t there. If it was, we would have noticed it immediately.\u201dYou Huo said: \u201cI didn\u2019t put this one in.\u201d\u201cThen does that mean that this was something the black widow made?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s weird! There is a total of eighteen households. If you include the village chief\u2019s daughter, it\u2019s a total of nineteen people. The black widow gave us twenty dolls? She can\u2019t count? Or did she do it deliberately to confuse us?\u201dYou Huo pinched the dolls leg and said: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because the person the doll matched with was overlooked.\u201dAs soon as he said those words, everyone stopped.What do you mean overlooked? All eighteen households in the villagers were given their doll. Did someone not come out?Impossible. Even the exam deemed them as correctly completing the task.How could anyone be overlooked in the examination centre?Everyone thought about this for a moment.Suddenly, their expressions turned green\u2014\u2014\u2014Of course they could. There were also examinees.Yu Wen shuddered: \u201cBrother, please don\u2019t tell ghost stories so late at night.\u201dWith this scare, everyone couldn\u2019t help but glance at each other.It was as if anyone here could be a ghost.They then noticed that You Huo was looking at someone on the right.The person being looked at was Yu Yao.She was the first to find her room and was currently swiping her card to open the door.The hotel had plenty of heating, so she had taken off Mike\u2019s large jacket.Like this, her torn clothes were naturally exposed. The clothes were torn both at her shoulder and at her pant legs.On her right exposed ankle, there was a small bellflower pattern. The lights in the corridor was bright enough to allow the others to clearly see it. It was exactly the same as the pattern on the doll\u2019s leg.Yu Yao stood in place with a ghostly pale expression.The expressions of the others were even more pale.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.Sister?\u201d Yu Wen\u2019s voice shook, \u201cYou\u2026\u2026.what\u2019s going on with you?\u201dYu Yao lowered her eyes. Her shoulders shook.After a long time, she lifted her head and looked at You Huo. With a pair of red-rimmed eyes that made her look like she had just cried, she asked: \u201cYou\u2026\u2026.when did you find out?\u201dEven at this moment, her voice was very gentle.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netYou Huo remained calm. He still retained his usual lazy and sleepy look: \u201cMe? I noticed something in the first exam and I only confirmed it just now.\u201dYu Wen was terrified: \u201cFirst exam? What was wrong with the first exam?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cThe question mentioned that there are thirteen people dining. Try and count how many people there are.\u201dYu Wen quietly counted: \u201cIt\u2019s thirteen!\u201dAs soon as he said that, he realised something: \u201cNo. There are thirteen examinees, but the people dining also include the hunter so that would be fourteen\u2026\u2026.Was one of us not human?\u201dEveryone looked at Yu Yao. Their faced turned from white to green.\u201cSister\u2026\u2026\u2026.What\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201dYu Wen wanted to say \u201cWhat the hell are you\u201d but just as those words were about to be said, the young boy relented and changed his words: \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201dYu Yao gripped tightly onto the door handle and exhaled softly: \u201cCome in. I\u2019ll tell you everything. It\u2019s not convenient standing in the corridor.\u201dWho would dare enter?While the others hesitated, You Huo nodded his head.\u00b7Soon afterwards, everyone crowded inside Yu Yao\u2019s room.Yu Yao stared at the doll for a long time and finally spoke: \u201cWhen I said that it was my first exam\u2026\u2026\u2026It was actually a lie.\u201d\u201cI am indeed an examinee, but that was years ago. At that time, I was very unlucky. The first exam I got was the one we just finished. We were tested on Gypsy and I\u2026\u2026\u2026 was in the same group as Zhao Wentu.\u201d\u2026\u2026..She knew a little Gypsy so she helped make simple translations for her teammates.Like this, she became the girl constantly mentioned in Zhao Wentu\u2019s diary.But at that time, she didn\u2019t know of this diary\u2019s existence.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026After Zhao Wentu was gone, there were only two examinees left.Only Yu Yao and a middle-aged man remained.That night, as usual the ghost arm came.It originally came for the middle-aged man but amidst the panic he pushed her over and sent her to her death.\u201cI still clearly remember his final words. Kill her, don\u2019t kill me. I beg you. The ghost arm didn\u2019t aim accurately, and the knife fell several times. It probably\u2026\u2026.was not a good sight.\u201d Yu Yao shrank in her seat as she recalled her memories.The group couldn\u2019t bear hearing this: \u201cThen you\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cI should\u2019ve met the same fate as the other examinees and be buried in the woods and become another one of the villagers?\u201d Yu Yao said: \u201cI also thought that, but maybe I was lucky.\u201dShe had cried for Zhao Wentu all day, and even went into the woods trying to find blood stains left behind by him to try and find his body.If the worst comes to the worst\u2026\u2026She could at least set up a grave for him.In the end, after searching around all night she didn\u2019t find any traces of Zhao Wentu and instead she found a card.\u201cWhat card?\u201d You Huo asked.Yu Yao said: \u201cRetake the exam.\u201d\u201cAfter I was\u2026\u2026.cut, that card took effect but because it was something I picked up, it only worked halfway.\u201dEveryone asked blankly: \u201cHalfway? What does that mean?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t become monsters like the other examinees, but I also wasn\u2019t completely resurrected to retake the exam.\u201d Yu Yao said: \u201cI drifted down the river in the village and was picked up by the black widow.\u201dYou Huo suddenly remembered the village chief once mentioning that the black widow specialised in dealing with the dead and had once picked up a girl from the river.\u201cI was clearly an examinee, but I also seemed to have become a part of the examination centre.\u201dAs part of the exam, the black widow used witchcraft on Yu Yao and it worked on her.She sewed a doll that resembled Yu Yao from her daughter\u2019s hair and then Yu Yao, like the villagers, came back to life.\u201cWhen I woke up, I was like this with a big belly. The black widow said she had hidden her daughter inside me.\u201dEveryone\u2019s hair rose.They then noticed another problem: \u201cYou can understand the black widow?\u201d\u201cAs part of the exam, I could understand her.\u201d Yu Yao said: \u201cBut after I left, I was no longer able to understand it anymore. Even the Gypsy I knew in the past was forgotten.\u201d\u201cLeft?\u201d You Huo: \u201cThe driver said he never picked up anyone.\u201dYu Yao: \u201cAm I still considered human? Even I don\u2019t know myself.\u201dShe was like a bug that had appeared by accident. She stood somewhere in between an examinee and an NPC.She didn\u2019t leave the examination centre by the intercity bus. Instead, she walked on her own for a very long time. After walking through numerous unknown places, she just happened to run into a group of examinees about to enter an exam.Perhaps it was something the system did deliberately, or perhaps it was because of other factors.Her memory got worse and worse. She could no longer remember the things that happened before the exam nor could she remember the people who had harmed her or protected her.\u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was supposed to do so I thought I could help out the examinees.\u201d Yu Yao said, \u201cThis continued until a certain exam where I once again saw the man who hurt me.\u201dYu Wen heard this and couldn\u2019t help but swear: \u201cFuck! He\u2019s still not dead?\u201d\u201cI later learned that he had an exam exemption card that he won through the casino.\u201d Yu Yao said: \u201cHe had wanted to try and pass that foreign language exam without using the card, but he later found it too difficult and used the card up.\u201d\u201cThen did you find him?\u201dYu Yao didn\u2019t speak. You Huo instead spoke up: \u201cYou found him. In the first exam.\u201dEveryone froze.Yu Yao was silent for a moment before she finally nodded.\u201cWho?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cThe one who turned into the hunter.\u201dEveryone was stunned.After a long time, Yu Yao sighed softly: \u201cI have always wanted to apologise to you. I have been overlooked by the system a lot and that violation that time\u2026\u2026.they probably overlooked me. You were stained by the ink, so the system wrongly punished you. I have been trying to find a chance all along to compensate you.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201dEven if he was punished a few more times, he didn\u2019t lose anything.\u201cBut you.\u201d You Huo said: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything when you saw Zhao Wentu?\u201dYu Yao was silent for a long time. She smiled bitterly and said in a quiet voice: \u201cI have already become like this. My face is also different now. Probably because of the black widow\u2019s daughter\u2019s influence, I now look like a young woman who had just come of age so he couldn\u2019t recognise me. Also, I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m a human or a ghost so\u2026\u2026\u2026..I didn\u2019t want to disappoint him.\u201dIf they didn\u2019t meet then\u2026\u2026.the Zhao Wentu who managed to remember his own name would at the very least be satisfied during his final moment in life.As for his regrets, it would remain inside his diary.He himself wouldn\u2019t be distressed about it anymore, only the ones who read it would know.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: OMG the black widow actually hid her daughter inside her.

The knowledge being assessed may not be difficult and may even be very simple, but the system would always have a way to twist it so that it could kill you.Different examination centres could accommodate different numbers of examinees so whether or not one could become teammates would depend on luck.As a bug, Yu Yao was the only free examinee and she could freely choose her own exams.That was why she was able to take the same physics exam as the bald man, and that was also why she was able to enter the same centre as You Huo and Yu Wen for foreign language.She used her identity as a bug to help out her comrades, but she didn\u2019t make it obvious.For example, in Chars Village.\u201cThose ghost limbs have a special habit.\u201d Yu Yao said.If there are guests who have sewn dolls and guests who haven\u2019t, they would give priority to those who have sewn themAfter Yu Yao was resurrected by the black widow, she was considered as half belonging to Chars Village. As long as she was there, the ghost limbs would subconsciously ignore that place.As such, on the first night of the exam, only Liang Yuan Hao and Chen Bin sewed the doll and only they separated from the group, so the ghost limbs naturally went after them.As for the second night, the ghost limb should have gone to find Chen Bin first but at that time Chen Bin was with Yu Yao and the others so the ghost limb could only retreat and go find You Huo instead.As for the third night\u2026\u2026\u2026You Huo himself sewed sixteen dolls, attracting all the hatred. Yu Yao conversely stayed with the others. With the ghost limbs having a clear goal, they all became frenzied.\u2027Chen Bin now realised that he was able to narrowly escape from death not just once.He thanked Yu Yao with gratitude and couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us this earlier?\u201dYu Yao\u2019s voice was soft. She said in a quiet voice: \u201cI look like a pregnant woman. If I behave too strangely or reveal that I know too much, the first reaction from others would often be doubt and wariness. Rather than doing as I say, they would even regard me as an enemy.\u201dEveryone fell silent.They tried to visualise it, and couldn\u2019t refute.\u201cBut you\u2019re all special, really.\u201d Yu Yao said earnestly: \u201cEver since we first met, all of you have always held good intentions. You would offer me allowance, call me sister, be punished in my stead and even lend me clothes to wear. I used to be constantly depressed and I felt like a lost soul wandering in and out of exams but now I would occasionally feel like I\u2019m alive. I have to thank you all for that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I decided to follow along to see if I could help even a little bit.\u201d She pushed back her hair and added: \u201cBut that was just my wishful thoughts. You probably are no longer willing. That\u2019s okay, I understand. Even I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable if I was in your position.\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesYou Huo remained leaning against the door.When Yu Yao finished talking, he suddenly broke the silence and said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of whether or not I\u2019m willing. It\u2019s the same to me regardless.\u201dYu Yao remained silent for a moment.Old Yu and his son also agreed: \u201cIf you want to follow then follow! We don\u2019t mind. You didn\u2019t try to harm us anyway.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right sister.\u201d Yu Wen also couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cIs Yu Yao not your real name?\u201dIf it was, why didn\u2019t the bald man recognise her when she said her name?Yu Yao this time blushed. She said with an apologetic expression: \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t speak truthfully at that time. That was a name I made up on the spot. Because I felt that you were very kind, I borrowed your surname.\u201dAs she said this, she flipped over the room card in her hand and pushed it over.On the card it said:Name: Shu XueExamination Ticket Number: 860575-02091318-1127Completed subjects: Foreign LanguageTotal points: 12\u201cThis is my name.\u201d\u201cMathematics?\u201d Yu Wen was amused: \u201cSister, your parents have the same taste as my family. Looks like we must still come from the same ancestor despite having different surnames.\u201d (KK notes: Mathematics(\u6578\u5b78)=Shu Xue. Homonym to Shu Xue\u2019s name. As a side note, Yu Wen\u2019s name is also a homonym for \u8bed\u6587 AKA Chinese)\u201dYu Yao\u2026\u2026.Oh, actually she should be called Shu Xue now.Shu Xue laughed: \u201cI also met someone whose name was a homonym for physics. We should form a group together.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026..Why do you only have one exam there? The total points also didn\u2019t increase.\u201d Everyone wondered.\u201cIt has always been like that. Every time I get to the rest stops, it has only been always been the same.\u201d\u201cOh is that so\u2026..\u201dThe others weren\u2019t able to process this information quick enough. You Huo went straight to the point: \u201cThen it means that you will never be able to finish the exam?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Shu Xue fell silent for a moment. She then smiled, \u201cBut I\u2019m happy enough just to let you guys get through this safely.\u201dYou Huo lowered his eyes and fell in thought. He placed the doll in front of her.The villagers were freed once they were given a doll, so what about Shu Xue? Would she be freed?\u201cThank you.\u201d Shu Xue was touched: \u201cActually, I would pick up this doll everyday back when I used to live in Chars Village, but nothing happened. It probably only works for the villagers\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dYou Huo however said: \u201cIt\u2019s not the same.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Shu Xue was confused.\u201cThe question said that it must be given out by an examinee.\u201d You Huo bend down a little and pushed the doll closer to her, \u201cI\u2019m giving it to you now.\u201dShu Xue froze. Her eyes fell onto the doll before her. She stared at it without blinking.At this moment, she felt very nervous.You Huo glanced at her clasped fingers. He picked up his backpack that was sitting on the table and said: \u201cIt\u2019s up to you whether or not you accept it. I\u2019m sleepy. Going to sleep now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone present couldn\u2019t help but think: Why are you sleepy again\u2026\u2026\u2026?After You Huo left, the others also felt that it was inappropriate for them to be there, so they similarly returned to their rooms.\u2027Over the next few days, except for mealtimes, Shu Xue didn\u2019t leave her room.It was the similar for the others too.For the first two days, they would wander around outside, but they soon found that the rest stop was too deserted. There wasn\u2019t a single person around and even though the lights in the buildings were on, no one answered when they knocked. The lights were probably only there for show.They couldn\u2019t afford eating at the restaurants and the only department store there only offered small discounts.You Huo was dragged around several times and he finally lost his patience.He eventually locked his door and even hung up a \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d sign before going back to sleep.\u2027The five-day break went by very quickly.Just before 7am on the fifth day, a group of people gathered at the hotel lobby.You Huo managed to catch up on his sleep during this time so for once he wasn\u2019t in an irate mood.He came downstairs with earphones in and saw Shu Xue the moment he entered the lobby.She had been holed up for five days straight, but she looked no different from before.You Huo\u2019s eyes swept over to her stomach. He took off the left earphone.Shu Xue spoke up before he could say anything: \u201cI thought about it and I still want to take another exam together with you all, so I asked Yu Wen to hold onto the doll first. I heard that the difficulty of the exams changes so the third exam is likely going to be more difficult. I\u2019m a little worried\u2026\u2026It\u2019s not too late for me to accept the doll once that exam is over.\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t like to intervene with other people\u2019s decisions so he didn\u2019t say anything. He just nodded his head before putting the earphone back in again.\u2027At exactly 7am, they entered the department store.In total, there were a total of eight floors. Like most shopping malls, it has pretty much everything.Please read this from kk translates\u201cMy god, there\u2019s every jewellery?\u201d Yu Wen looked at the counters and couldn\u2019t help but exclaim, \u201cWhy would they even have these and let it take up space? What kind of idiot would by them?\u201dAs soon as he finished saying that, his brother pulled out a men\u2019s watch from the counter and threw it into his shopping cart.Yu Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe immediately changed his words: \u201cA watch doesn\u2019t count. A watch is very useful!\u201dIf the clock in the exam centre no longer works\u2026\u2026\u2026For once, the department store finally had a bit more life. Several people wandered around and there were even hotel staff and restaurant owners present.A long banner hung from the top of the building. It said:Once a week discount day. From 7-10am, half of the products are 50% off. As today is December 13<sup>th</sup>, the 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> customer will get an additional lucky draw chance. Winning rate of up to 90%.In his entire life, You Huo never had much luck with lottery systems like this.So he didn\u2019t even spare a glance at the banner and just went straight up to the second floor via the escalator.The down jacket bought last time was ruined by the coffin boards, so he wandered around several times and picked up three new jackets.Yu Wen saw this and couldn\u2019t help but be worried: \u201cBrother, hold yourself back a little. Why do you need so many jackets?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cJust in case.\u201dJust in case you break the rules again?After picking up his clothes, he turned around and entered the supermarket. He proceeded to grab some fast food and canned food.Although there were more discounts today, for most examinees they would only window shop. It was naturally impossible for them to buy anything.As such, very few actually needed to check out.You Huo glanced downstairs and saw that the checkout counter was empty; there was no need to line up.His cart was very eye-catching.Wherever he went, examinees would stare at him.During the time he pushed it from the seventh floor to the first floor, the empty checkout counter had become rowdy.You Huo ventured closer and immediately understood the reason for that.At this moment, there was someone standing at the checkout counter. It was a tall man dressed in a smoky grey shirt. With both hands pressed down onto the counter supporting him, his defined shoulders and back was visible through his clothes.You Huo\u2019s footsteps stopped. He then rolled his eyes.That back view was too easy to recognise. Who else could it be apart from invigilator 001?A group of examinees stood in a circle not far from the invigilator. Their mouths were wide open in shock as they stared at his shopping cart.That great master not only needed one cart, he had two\u2026\u2026\u2026..The cashier closed his mouth and counted the contents inside his cart with a stiff expression.You Huo slowly walked over. He heard the cashier ask: \u201c\u2026\u2026.Are you sure you need four sets of clothing and two jackets?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cYeah.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cYou also want these cans of meat?\u201d The cashier placed emphasis on the word \u2018these\u2019.Qin Jiu: \u201cYeah.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cThis watch\u2014\u2013\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cYeah.\u201dThe cashier\u2019s expression was about to crumble: \u201cThen the suitcase\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dQin Jiu\u2019s patience was at its limit. He tapped his finger and urged the cashier: \u201cNo need to check. I want them all. Please check them out for me.\u201dWhen the cashier tapped on the keyboard, Qin Jiu looked around. The moment he saw You Huo behind him, he raised an eyebrow and smiled: \u201cGood morning. You\u2019re awake today?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026..Why are you here?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cBuying some examination supplies.\u201dYou Huo assessed him from top to bottom and said succinctly: \u201cAn invigilator still needs exam supplies? Don\u2019t you have your own building?\u201dQin Jiu let out an \u2018oh\u2019 and said: \u201cAn invigilator naturally doesn\u2019t need it, but an examinee should at least prepare themselves a little.\u201dYou Huo coldly snorted.A few seconds later, he suddenly looked up: \u201cRepeat that last part again. Who\u2019s an examinee?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cMe.\u201dYou Huo\u2019s response: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dYou Huo asked: \u201cWhy?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cThe system thinks that I overdid it when I provided help so according to the rules, I am punished to be an examinee for one round.\u201dThe source of this punishment was the help card, so it naturally had something to do with You Huo.He thought for a moment and added: \u201cHow long is one round?\u201dQin Jiu said: \u201cAt present, the entire examination consists of five subjects. Just like you, it will only count if I pass.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cOh.\u201dHe thought for a moment and, not knowing what else to say, he moved to put his earphones back in.But before he could do that, Qin Jiu spoke up: \u201cDuring the disciplinary period, I have no right to choose my own subjects. According to the rules, I must follow an examinee. Examinees could be personally selected but I\u2019m lazy so\u2026\u2026\u2026I went with the default.\u201dYou Huo held his earphones: \u201cWho\u2019s the default?\u201dQin Jiu laughed: \u201cDon\u2019t make that face. This is the rule. I ended up like this because of your help card so you naturally can\u2019t escape from it.\u201dHe took off his gloves and lazily stretched his hand out: \u201cPlease take care of me fellow examinee?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dYou Huo wanted to slam the shopping cart into his face.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: They\u2019re gonna be stuck together again \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was as if he had forgotten what he wanted to say.The cashier waited for the rest of his words but was met with silence. He tried to name a few items to help jog his memory: \u201cWhat is it? Cigarettes? Lighters? Alcohol?\u201dQin Jiu gently let out an \u2018ah\u2019 and said in a joking tone as he lowered his hand: \u201cA habit. I keep thinking that I should also buy something else, but I can\u2019t remember now. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dThe cashier nodded and reported the total price: \u201cIn total\u2026..19 points.\u201dThe examinees standing around were extremely fascinated: The total points amongst them probably don\u2019t even add up to 20 yet this person here spent 19 in one go.And the most annoying thing was, that person actually said to the cashier after hearing the total: \u201cJust give me something from the shelf behind you to round it up.\u201dCashier: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dRounding it up. Listen to those crazy words of his.The cashier was also a reserve invigilator who was sent over here to be a cashier as punishment, so he had met many invigilators before and naturally has heard of invigilator 001.But when he was working, Qin Jiu was recuperating and someone like invigilator 001 wouldn\u2019t randomly appear in a place like this.So the cashier didn\u2019t recognise him.The young man earnestly tried to persuade him: \u201cSir, it\u2019s like this. You just happen to be the twelfth customer today so you would have a lucky draw chance. With this, you may be able to get even more discounts so\u2026.Even if you round it up now, it\u2019s useless. It might not be a round number after the discount.\u201d\u201cThere was something like this?\u201d Qin Jiu said.\u201cYes. It says so on the banner.\u201d The cashier pointed above him, \u201cThe twelfth and thirteenth customer are the lucky ones today but the two of you will need to check out first and then go and exchange for it together.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Qin Jiu glanced up at the banner. He then looked over at You Huo with a sly smile: \u201cLucky one, come and check out.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWith that mouth of his, he didn\u2019t know if 001 had ever been beaten up by someone before but he sure as hell hoped he did.You Huo pushed his shopping card over and proceeded to place his items onto the counter.The cashiers face turned green again.What\u2019s going on today? A gathering of shopaholics?He muttered this internally as he counted You Huo\u2019s items one by one: \u201cTwo jackets\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cTwo cops of instant noodles, two cans of meat.\u201d\u201cA watch.\u201dHuh\u2026.It sounded a little familiar.The cashier secretly glanced at the two of them, but he didn\u2019t dare to speak.He helped You Huo pack his items up and then he reported the total price: \u201cTotal of 5 points.\u201dHe was afraid that You Huo would also say \u201cround it up for me\u201d so he quickly bent down and took a wooden box out from under the counter.Please read this from kk translates\u201cHere, the lottery box.\u201d The cashier introduced: \u201cThere are a total of 100 lottery tickets in here. The best one is 90% off. There is only a total of five of those but that\u2019s okay, there are also fifteen 70% off tickets, thirty 50% off tickets and forty 20% off tickets. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. IF you find a second place like this, you can cut my head off.\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t care about these, nor did he care about his head.He asked: \u201cWhat are the rest?\u201dThe cashier said: \u201cUh\u2026..five 10% off tickets, three 5% off tickets and two original price tickets.\u201d\u201cBut just think about it. The 10% off ones may seem abysmal but the probability of drawing that one is the same as drawing a 90% off ticket. It\u2019s very hard to draw. And there are only three of the 5% off ones and 2 of the original price tickets.\u201d He quickly added: \u201cWhat does that mean? It means that there are less of them than the 90% off tickets! Trust me. I\u2019ve been here for a long time and I have only seen people draw the 90% off tickets and never the 5% ones or the original price tickets. Afterall, the purpose of this activity is to reduce the burden on everyone and help you save even a little bit. Points are after all a matter of life and death.\u201dYou Huo said: \u201cSo I just draw?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe cashier was almost blinded by his enthusiasm.He glumly turned the lottery box around so that the side with writing faced You Huo and Qin Jiu: \u201cHere. In order to strengthen the bond between examines, there is a special rule for this and that is, mutual draw. The ticket you draw will be his while the ticket he draws will be yours. This rule is actually quite famous, so you probably have heard about it already.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cI have heard of it. The general consensus is that your boss doesn\u2019t like to do things the humane way and wants to start a fight amongst examinees.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.It\u2019s a big discount after all so how could it be so easy?\u201d\u201cHere, I love this moment the most. It\u2019s so exciting! It basically determines the relationship between the two and whether or not they can be friends in the future.\u201d The cashier shook the box and gestured for them to go ahead and draw.Five seconds later.Qin Jiu gave You Huo a 5% off ticket while You Huo in turn gave him an original price ticket.Qin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dCashier: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThere is something called mutual harm.There was also something called not letting the other party off.Everyone managed to witness this today.In the end, Qin Jiu still asked the cashier to help him round the numbers up.You Huo saw him pull out his card and found it strange: \u201cWhere did you get the points?\u201d\u201cThe system gifted it.\u201d Qin Jiu said.You Huo was a little surprised.You are gifted points even though you\u2019re getting punished? What kind of punishment is this?Qin Jiu: \u201cDo you know what this means?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cWhat?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cMany exam centres have a threshold for examinees. For example, examinees who are taking their first exam would be grouped together while those who have passed two exams would be grouped together in a different exam centre. The difficulty will also be different. With the system gifting me points, it means that the third subject that you will be choosing this time would have a threshold. The more subjects you clear, the more difficult the upcoming exams will be. It gifted me those starting points firstly to allow me to meet that criteria and be able to enter the same exam as you and secondly to ensure the exam difficulty so that I would not be divided into a group of examinees with zero experience.\u201dWhen Qin Jiu was asked questions about the system last time, he would always receive a warning.Now that he had been punished and demoted to an examinee, he was no longer restricted by those rules.You Huo asked: \u201cHow much did it give?\u201d\u201cIt is said that it was calculated based on the lowest score earned in a subject when I was an examinee. It is difficult to tell whether or not that is the truth.\u201dYou Huo internally thought: \u2018You don\u2019t even know what your own scores are? You should be able to tell in one glance whether or not that is true.\u2019Qin Jiu held up his card and turned it over to show You Huo.The demoted invigilator 001 held a card that resembled the ones the examinees possessed. It had his basic information written on the back:Name: Qin JiuExamination Ticket Number: 86010-06141729-GICompleted subjects: 2Total points: 20Unlike the examinees whose examination numbers end with numbers, his one ended with two letters of unknown meaning.Seeing You Huo staring at the letters \u2018GI\u2019, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s something unique to invigilators who have violated the rules. It works the same way as an examinee\u2019s number.\u201dThe English letters at the end of the ticket number was assigned by the system in order to differentiate the invigilators from the examinees.Qin Jiu\u2019s one was supposed to be GIN but the card left out one the last letter, so it became GI.This was something he should already know, but he had forgotten about it when his memory suffered some damage.It was unknown whether the invigilator responsible for writing it at the time genuinely made a mistake or if it was deliberately done as a joke.The cashier looked at Qin Jiu as if he was looking at a madman. In an instant, Qin Jiu had used up all his points.\u201cDo you have a grudge against yourself?\u201d The cashier couldn\u2019t help but ask.Qin Jiu laughed. He left You Huo with a \u201csee you at night\u201d and then left the rest stop.Please read this from kk translatesAt night, they all proceeded to check out from the hotel.A sign had appeared at some unknown point in time on the street, so everyone followed it down to an intersection.As expected, there was a T-shaped intersection.When they reached the centre of the intersection, the scenery behind them became blurred. Very quickly, everything was obscured by the thick fog and dark night.Three street signs stood at the end of each road:ChineseMathematicsHistoryAt the very centre was a familiar looking pavilion.Less than a second after the speaker inside the pavilion sounded, Qin Jiu appeared from within the dense fog\u2026\u2026\u2026pulling along his suitcase.\u201cIt\u2019s my first time seeing an examinee so damned laidback\u2026..\u201d Yu Wen quietly whispered to his brother.After speaking, he fell silent for a few seconds before adding: \u201cOh, that\u2019s not right. There\u2019s one right here in front of me. Never mind. Take it as if I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201dQin Jiu stopped beside the group.The speaker finally finished blaring. It paused for a moment and finally went straight to the point:\u3010Sudden examination reformation applies to this round. The current examination system has been changed to grades. All examinees would be divided according to their rankings into grades A, B, C or D. The top 10% will be Grade A. Grade B will consist of the top 50% excluding Grade A. Following that the top 75% will be Grade C and the rest is D.\u3011\u201cFuck\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dYu Wen who had been plagued with exam reformations for the past three years responded to this news with a plethora of curses.And the announcement didn\u2019t end here.\u3010The points will now be regarded as grades. The grades will be reassigned at the end of every exam.\u3011\u3010Elimination style system has been adopted henceforth. After each examination, examinees with a grade of D will be directly eliminated. Examinees with a grade of C will be under review and will need to retake the exam.\u3011\u3010The re-examination questions will be based on the original exam and the sub questions will appropriately modified.\u3011\u3010Examinees of grade B or above can freely continue onto their next exam while examinees of grade C will need to take the exam again. Examinees of grade D will be eliminated.\u3011\u3010Now updating results\u2026\u2026..\u3011In a blink of an eye, the LCD screen outside the pavilion suddenly turned on. Several lines appeared.It was reporting the grade conversion results of the examinees present.Yu Wen: AYu Yi Guo: AMike Rogen: AThanks to You Huo\u2019s blessing and the fact that they didn\u2019t mess around with their points, they currently held the highest grade.Chen Bin: BYou Huo: BThe former was able to achieve this thanks to a golden thigh while the latter dropped in rank because he bought too many things.Shu Xue: CShe may forever be C.Qin Jiu: D\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Those 0 points was something he had brought about himself.No comment.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Friggen hell Qin Jiu \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They turned to look at him.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dFor a moment, no one understood what he meant.You Huo turned to Shu Xue: \u201cAccording to your card, you only took one test and the total score was 12 points.\u201dShu Xue nodded and quietly made a sound of agreement.\u201cI don\u2019t know what people would normally get in an exam but if I remembered correctly, the average score for Gypsy was only 5. Even if the exam taken by other examinees was a bit easier how could 12 points give you a C grade?\u201d You Huo said: \u201cWho are you trying to cheat?\u201dThe speakers continued to play dead.It was clear that the system didn\u2019t want to answer this question of his but because You Huo\u2019s words were filled with scorn, the system finally refreshed the contents on the LCD screen:Qin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dDespite the fact that the system could just word using percentiles, it went out of its way to emphasise the fact that he was last.As soon as these results appeared on the screen, Shu Xue\u2019s expression paled.No one knew what to say to comfort her.To be honest, just the fact that she was able to enter and leave exams freely for such a long time was already an amazing feat.How could a savvy system like this tolerate the existence of a bug like her?You Huo even suspected that this sudden exam reformation was done by the system in order to give itself an excuse to justify its act of giving her a C ranking and forcing her to retake the exam. Like this she would be forever trapped inside the same exam with no chance of escaping.In other words, it was trying to imprison her.Please read this from kk translatesBefore he could return from his thoughts, Qin Jiu suddenly spoke up.\u201cOkay then, give us the punishment.\u201d He leaned against his suitcase handle and directed his words at the pavilion: \u201cOne grade C and one grade D. What was the punishment again\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201d\u201c\u2014\u2014Ah, I remember now.\u201d He acted as if he just remembered. He pointed at Shu Xue and said: \u201cThis young lady needs to retake her last exam. The last exam centre was Gypsy. Send her over.\u201dSpeaker: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dShu Xue was stunned. Everyone else was suddenly overjoyed.That\u2019s right! That exam centre was already destroyed. How could she retake that exam?!As if his words of mockery weren\u2019t enough, Qin Jiu continued: \u201cAs for me being eliminated, I don\u2019t mind. I can just go back.\u201dSpeaker: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dIf the system was human, it would have probably gone mad right then and there.It had dragged this 001 over for punishment, yet he would be eliminated before he could even enter the exam centre? Who are you kidding?The speaker suddenly crackled. From amidst the crackling sounds, a voice could be heard:\u3010Due to abnormalities in the data and the exam room malfunctioning, the original punishments assigned to examinees cannot be implemented. Examinees are to participate in the next exam normally however five points will be deducted. The final scores will be as displayed.\u3011The LCD screen refreshed, and new contents appeared less than a second later.Shu Xue was relieved. Qin Jiu on the other hand\u2026\u2026\u2026Qin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter those two lines appeared, another four words slowly appeared at the bottom of the LCD screen.Best your father.After appeasing all the examinees, the speaker finally spoke about the main point.\u3010Except for invigilator 001 who is being punished, examinees have the right to choose their subjects and can decide the order in which they wish to complete the exams.\u3011\u3010Please make your selection within the next 30 seconds.\u3011Ticking sounds could be then be heard. Each tick correlated with a second. It made the people tense up.\u201cWhich one?\u201d Old Yu swallowed nervously: \u201cBut\u2026\u2026even if we choose the same subject, it\u2019s not guaranteed that we would end up in the same exam centre, right?\u201dAs an invigilator, Qin Jiu naturally had a lot of experience with this.\u201cThere are many factors considered including scores, the time the subject selection was made, the difficulty of the previous exam, how many times you\u2019ve teamed up\u2026\u2026\u2026In a nutshell, it depends on your fate.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll leave it up to fate. Let\u2019s choose one first.\u201d Yu Wen said.Chen Bin said: \u201cI have already done Mathematics and Chinese\u2026\u2026 I suggest you not to choose those. Look at my scores. The total scores from both those exams only add up to 10 points.\u201dIn fact, he didn\u2019t need to voice out those warnings. No one present wanted to choose Mathematics.They could instinctively tell that it would be quite troublesome.\u201cThen History?\u201d Yu Wen said.All the people present including Chen Bin had not taken that exam. At the very least, it meant that they wouldn\u2019t leave behind anyone and secondly\u2026\u2026\u2026.it sounded simpler.\u201cWill History just throw us into a certain dynasty and force us to participate in some historical event?\u201d Yu Wen fiddled with his fingers and said: \u201cAs long as it isn\u2019t something life-threatening, it should be fine. Regardless of our age, I think we should all more or less know some historical things. At the very least, we wouldn\u2019t be moving around blindly.\u201dYou Huo asked: \u201cHow much do you remember?\u201dYu Wen scratched his head: \u201c\u2026\u2026.Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, Qing I guess?\u201d (KKnotes: Yu Wen here is just naming the different Chinese dynasties. Chinese students tend to memorise the dynasties in order using mnemonics like this.)\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s already a lot my dear brother! It\u2019s all very important.\u201d Yu Wen said, \u201cI thought about it while I was studying and I decided that it was more effective just knowing the main points\u2026\u2026\u2026.but I also haven\u2019t forgotten about the rest. I still remember them a little. As long as you don\u2019t ask me what year it was, and who did what in what year, I can muddle my way through most questions.\u201dThe ticking sounds got louder and louder. Each tick reminded them of the fact that time was running out.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d You Huo patted the screen and turned to look at Qin Jiu: \u201cAnd you?\u201dQin Jiu raised his eyebrow: \u201cDo I even have a choice?\u201dHe then followed that with a smile: \u201cUp to you. I have long become desensitised towards subject selection.\u201dEveryone present was speechless.But after thinking about it, they realised that it made sense. As an invigilator, what subjects has he not seen? As for which is easier and which is more difficult, it probably no longer meant anything to him.Everyone made use of the last few seconds remaining and managed to enter the intersection marked \u201cHistory\u201d.You Huo walked through the dense fog.Milky white fog spread apart before his eyes, revealing the scene behind the intersection.It was a dock.Actually, calling it a dock was giving it too much credit. To be more specific, it was a stone platform of about seven or eight square metres. There were low metal railings on both sides of the platform and the stone platform pointed ahead\u2026\u2026..into an endless expanse of sea.A wooden ship was docked there. From a tall mast, it hung\u2026\u2026\u2026.a kerosene lamp?You Huo stared at the lamp and the ship strangely. He had a bad feeling.An old man wearing a grey shirt and black vest was rolling up his sleeves. He threw a ball of something off.You Huo looked down. It was a long rope ladder.The rope was soaked. It exuded a sour smell that it had accumulated over the past 800 years.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesThe old man stood by the side of the ship with his hands on his waist. He tore open the ropes binding the sails and then beckoned at You Huo: \u201cCome up. Stop wasting time you two. I\u2019m in a hurry here.\u201dYou two?When You Huo thought this, he heard the rolling of suitcase wheels stop beside him.\u201cTsk.\u201d Qin Jiu glanced up. His dissatisfaction was evident: \u201cI\u2019m most tired of examinations on ships.\u201dYou Huo responded: \u201cI tired of examinations regardless of where it is.\u201dThe old man urged them again: \u201cHurry!\u201dYou Huo said: \u201cWait a little longer.\u201dThe old man said: \u201cWhat are you waiting for?! There\u2019s no one else, just you two. I\u2019m in a hurry here. Hurry up!\u201dYou Huo stalled for a moment.Qin Jiu quietly let out an \u2018ah\u2019 and said: \u201cLooks like their luck is bad this time and didn\u2019t get assorted to the same group as us.\u201dNot in the same group?Then what would happen?You Huo thought of the others\u2026\u2026\u2026His brows furrowed.Under the old man\u2019s urging, You Huo and Qin Jiu boarded the wooden ship one after another.The dirty sail changed its position slightly and the ship soon left the stone platform.By the time You Huo reached the deck, the stone platform had already become submerged inside the dense fog. Not a trace was left behind.All that was left was the wooden ship, sailing solitarily on the sea.The next second, jingles suddenly began to play.You Huo followed the sound and found its source. On a wooden box next to the old man was a small inconspicuous music box. It looked like a semi-finished product.After the music box\u2019s strange music ended, the system\u2019s familiar sound appeared:\u3010Examinees have boarded their ships. Navigating to examination centre.\u3011\u3010In thirty minutes, the exam will officially begin.\u3011\u3010Subject examined: History.\u3011\u3010Knowledge tested: World history, Sea Coachmen.\u3011\u3010All examinees please prepare yourselves.\u3011You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat happened to the agreed Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, Qing?Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: I searched around a little regarding \u201cSea Coachmen\u201d and it looks like it\u2019s a name the Chinese gave to the period where the Dutch was a maritime and ocean trading superpower in the 17<sup>th</sup> century.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019ll probably for be for about 2 weeks but it might be sooner than that if I\u2019m very productive. Once my other project is completed though, this novel will be updated daily~You Seem DeliciousChapter 38: Open QuestionThe old man adjusted the sails and then he wiped his hands on his pants.After jumping off the helm, his eyes glanced back and forth between You Huo and Qin Jiu.\u201cHow can two young and healthy men like you stand there while a weak old man like me is worked to the bones?\u201d The old man revealed his ripped arms that were twice the size of most people.What do you mean weak old man\u2026\u2026Qin Jiu smiled and said: \u201cThe weak must feel wronged.\u201dOld man: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dAngered, he sent a harsh glare at Qin Jiu: \u201cDon\u2019t just stand around with your arms crossed. I\u2019m most annoyed by young people who stand around with a cold expression acting all aloof!\u201dThe innocent You Huo found himself dragged into the situation: \u201c\u2026\u2026..What do you need help with?\u201dThe old man kicked the deck and said: \u201cThe hinges are a little rusted. I can\u2019t fix it alone so help me open it up. Otherwise you will just have to shrivel up on the deck!\u201dAlright then.You Huo was rendered speechless. He stretched out his feet and gave the deck a stomp to test its sturdiness.That act of his was purely done out of habit, but he soon found himself stepping onto Qin Jiu\u2019s shoe instead.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cThis examinee, aren\u2019t you being too childish?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m checking the deck. Why did you put your foot there?\u201d\u201cWhat a coincidence, so am I.\u201d Qin Jiu said.He lifted his foot and tested out a few areas before saying: \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s empty space under here. The two sides here are uneven, you can\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201dAs he said that, You Huo had already picked up a thin metal hook from the pile of debris nearby.He used the hook and inserted in between the two uneven deck boards.With a slam, sawdust scattered in all directions.The old man silently took a few steps back.He then saw You Huo lift his leg and then proceed to step heavily onto the obliquely angled hook.CRACK\u2014\u2014\u2014A crack formed across the deck.Qin Jiu was still wearing his black leather gloves. Before You Huo was able to do anything, he had already bent down and placed his hand into the gap that had formed. He then exerted some energy.The entire deck was ripped open.The rusty hinges fell to the ground with a clang.You Huo held the metal hook and glanced at Qin Jiu.It had been a long time since he encountered someone who could keep up with his pace.But the old man\u2019s face was completely green with anger.That deck was actually trap door.After opening it up, you could see stairs leading to the cabins below. Kerosene lamps hung from various places around the cabins and you could see separated bunk beds inside.The old man opened his mouth wanting to give them another other.But You Huo had already patted his back. He indicated with his chin: \u201cLead the way. Thanks.\u201dThe old man stared at him and closed his mouth.The three of them moved down to the cabins below. After covering the surface with the broken deck boards, the interior of the ship warmed up instantly.The old man didn\u2019t spare them any attention and went straight into his own single room. He then slammed the door shut right in front of their faces.Less than a minute later, a thunderous roar could be heard from the room.You Huo looked at the filthy sheets and had no intention to touch it. He found a chair in the cabin and sat down.A moment later, Qin Jiu also came over. His fingers were still pinching the tip of his nose. He was clearly quite bothered by the smell.Despite this, he still didn\u2019t forget to tease You Huo: \u201cIs today a special day? Why are you still awake?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe glanced at Qin Jiu: \u201cHow about I press you down onto that bed and let you breathe it in for half an hour? How does that sound?\u201dQin Jiu chuckled: \u201cThat\u2019s okay. But I might also drag you along to enjoy it together.\u201dYou Huo internally cursed him out.\u201cHow much do you remember about the Sea Coachmen?\u201d Qin Jiu asked.He rested his elbow on the table and his other hand played with the flame inside the kerosene lamp.Seeing that they held tacit understanding between them when they broke open the deck, You Huo replied: \u201cNetherlands.\u201dMany years had passed since he graduated from high school and he also didn\u2019t study liberal arts so his knowledge about history was very limited.In short, during that century Netherlands was also known as the Sea Coachmen.You Huo no longer remembered the reason for it but it probably had something to do with their cheap trading prices.The Netherlands had merchant vessels that were able to hold more cargo and they were also cheaper to rent compared to other merchant ships. It is said that they were very influential at that time.That was pretty much all he remembered about the Sea Coachmen.But\u2026\u2026..\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between remembering and not remembering?\u201d You Huo also added, \u201cWill they test it properly?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cIf you\u2019re lucky, there is a one in one thousandth possibility.\u201dYou Huo snorted: \u201cIt\u2019s faster to dream.\u201dWasn\u2019t this dumbass system\u2019s personality obvious enough? It naturally wouldn\u2019t do something like that.Even if it did, it would twist the question a billion times first. It definitely wouldn\u2019t be honest or straightforward.The ship responsible for picking up examinees was very small.After less than a few minutes of sailing, strong sea winds and waves appeared on the surface of the sea.It was as if it was simulating the moment they left the \u2018fake sea\u2019 and entered the \u2018real sea\u2019.The sea was very rough.They could hear the roar of thunderstorms coming from outside the wooden cabin. Occasionally, flashes from the lightning would penetrate through the trapdoor.The small ship swayed about.Despite being someone who doesn\u2019t get seasick, You Huo didn\u2019t feel comfortable. Qin Jiu\u2019s expression was equally unsightly.In this extremely uncomfortable environment, the two still fell asleep at the table. They became oblivious to the happenings outside.You Huo was awakened by the biting cold.He opened his eyes in daze and was met with a gloomy sky.Sky?He sat up. He saw that he was no longer inside the filthy boat cabin.Below him was a barely flat area of dark coloured reef. There was even a small layer of ice across it. The reef covered a large area and Qin Jiu laid nearby.They were probably still at sea. Behind them was a solitary island filled with rocks. Around the island were about twenty or so wooden ships.A dozen of them were similar to the ones they were on; small and worn out.There were three that were much larger.One of the three was lying crookedly nearby.You Huo could see that although the ship was rather narrow, the cargo and cabin area was large. It looked like those frozen dumplings.The lights on the ship were off, and some of its bows and masts had become frozen. You could tell that the ship had been moored there for a while, and no one was on board.You Huo patted Qin Jiu a few times. He found it a little strange.Even he himself was awake yet this person hadn\u2019t responded yet\u2026..The other party finally reacted after being patted awake. Squinting his eyes as he woke up, he initially didn\u2019t notice the changes around him. That alone was enough to show that Qin Jiu wasn\u2019t afraid of the cold.As he sat up and pinched his nose, he said to You Huo: \u201cMornin\u2019\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dYou Huo wanted to carve that word onto his face.\u201cEnjoy the breeze a little first and then decide whether you want to continue with your morning greeting.\u201dYou Huo stepped aside. The cold air that was blocked by him instantly surged onto Qin Jiu\u2019s face.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe effect was immediate. The invigilator instantly sobered up.Qin Jiu stood up. Using his glove to cover the glare, he looked out into the distance.From what he could see, everywhere was an extensive mass of ice and snow. It looked like polar ice fields.\u201cStill at sea?\u201d Qin Jiu frowned.\u201cYeah.\u201d You Huo pointed behind him with his thumb: \u201cThe island is back there.\u201dQin Jiu looked around: \u201cGo, let\u2019s check out the island.\u201dA moment later, You Huo, Qin Jiu\u2026\u2026\u2026and also Qin Jiu\u2019s suitcase was standing before a cave on the island.Someone had placed down a greying fabric at the entrance of the cave and used it as a marker.What made them uncomfortable was that they originally thought that the thing holding the fabric down was a mass of snow.But once they got closer, they noticed that there was a pair of eyes.Qin Jiu frowned when he recognised it: \u201cThe arctic rabbit.\u201dThe arctic rabbit had been dead for a long time. It had frozen together with the fabric and was sealed under a layer of ice.Just as You Huo was about to bend over to take a look, a familiar voice emerged from the arctic rabbit\u2019s body:\u3010All examinees have arrived at the exam centre.\u3011\u3010This exam is a large-scale examination. There is a total of 36 examinees which have been divided into 18 groups. There are two examinees in each group. The total points between the two examinees will be the basis for calculating the grade in this exam.\u3011\u3010The scoring method in this exam follows the participation model. There are no answer cards or standard correct answers. In addition to the original score, there are opportunities for bonus points, and the possibility of point deductions.\u3011\u3010At the end of this exam, groups with a total score ranking of C will need to undergo re-examination. Those of rank D will be eliminated.\u3011\u3010The starting scores for each group are as follows.\u3011At the same time, chiselling sounds could be heard from both inside and outside the cave. In the blink of an eye, the names of the 18 groups of examinees appeared on the flat stone surface above the arctic rabbit.The names were in pairs and next to it was a long bar. It indicated their total score.The higher the score, the higher the rank and hence the longer the bar.The list was ranked from highest to lowest score.You Huo glanced at it and saw the top group had a score of 42 points.Following that was a group with 40 points, 39.5 points, 35 points\u2026\u2026..And so on.Towards the middle, they saw Shu Xue\u2019s name. She was together with another examinee called Wu Li. (KKnotes: Another homonym. This time it\u2019s for physics. \u7269\u7406 ) The total score between them was 26 points. They were currently ranked twelfth and were temporarily given a C score.Apart from that, no other acquaintances were found.The Yu father and son pair were both not in this exam but maybe that was for the best. Perhaps they really did end up getting an exam about Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, Qing.As for You Huo and Qin Jiu\u2026\u2026..These two big names were too heavy. It sank all the way down and they were in the second to last position.Invigilator 001\u2019s points didn\u2019t help increase the total score. With just You Huo\u2019s effort alone, his 17.25 points solidified their D rank position.You Huo\u2019s expression was colder than the arctic rabbits\u2019.Qin Jiu\u2019s eyes met with his. He spread out his hands and said: \u201cThank you for your help top student. At last I\u2019m not sitting in last place. I have decided to work hard to help give you more face.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dEven the system/dead rabbit couldn\u2019t bear listening to his bullshit.The system\u2019s voice rudely interrupted him:\u3010The scores will be updated in real time. If you have any irrelevant questions, you can ask the invigilators of this exam; 154, 922, 078 and 021.\u3011When You Huo heard 154 and 922, he glanced over at Qin Jiu.\u201cDespite also being invigilator, why do you look so happy when you hear 154 and 922?\u201d Qin Jiu asked.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026With what eyes of yours did you see that?\u201dAs they spoke, the dead rabbit spoken up again:\u3010This exam will now officially start. We will now play out the exam question.\u3011\u3010Winter of 1597. Three Dutch ships were trapped in the frozen sea as it tried to reach Russia, so they temporarily docked on a nameless island and waited for the long winter to pass. This is currently the eighth month of their stay here. There are still 15 days until the end of winter and the ice melting. Please help all the crew members safely sail off.\u3011\u3010Question requirement: Do not let any of the crew members die. If one does, at midnight the group ranked last will bear the responsibility for their death.\u3011\u3010If there are more than two deaths in a day, it would be postponed until the next day. At midnight of the next day, the group ranked last would again bear the responsibility for the death and this would continue until the number of dead crew members are all covered.\u3011Bear the responsibility?How would they bear it? Die as replacement? Or die together?You Huo couldn\u2019t help but recall the villagers in Chars village. His expression again turned bad.He suddenly felt someone knocking twice on the back of his hand.You Huo looked down only to see that it was Qin Jiu\u2019s finger.\u201cDon\u2019t look at my hand. Look at the opening over there.\u201d Qin Jiu said this and raised his finger.You Huo looked over. He saw some people looking out from the cave opening.Those people wore thick grey clothes and brown woollen vests similar to those that you see in the middle ages. Some were also covered in dirty animal skins. All of them looked like foreigners.Their appearance could be described was withered. With a dull look, they slowly came out while carrying a few people.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dYou Huo looked at the people being carried. With a thud, his heart fell.Those people\u2019s eyes were tightly shut, and their faces were grey and lifeless. Two of them had even already hardened\u2026..The person at the head of the group appeared to be able to understand a little Chinese. He slowly looked over at You Huo and Qin Jiu with his dull eyes and said with extremely limited Chinese: \u201cDead. Crew member.\u201dQin Jiu\u2019s voice whispered softly: \u201cThis isn\u2019t good. We start off already with 8 dead crew members.\u201dThe last group wasn\u2019t enough buffer. Very soon, it would be their turn.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: The next one begins~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chapters will resume following the usual schedule (Monday, Wednesday and Friday). As soon as \u201cTo be a Heartthrob in a Horror Movie\u201d is finished, this will be updated daily~You Seem DeliciousChapter 39: Small Medicine BoxYou Huo and Qin Jiu entered the cave one after another, and the people inside all looked over.Although the weather was bleak and it was evening, the cave wasn\u2019t completely dark.Several kerosene lamps sat on the ground, projecting into the cave. Human figures sat around at the edges of the illuminated areas.You Huo glanced around.There were both men and women around. Except for a few middle-aged people, the rest of them were rather young.Unlike the ones carrying people out earlier, the people here were not wearing the same clothes. Down jackets, jackets, coats, sweaters\u2026\u2026..They were wrapped in almost everything. There was even one wearing a white doctors coat.After roughly counting thirty or so people, it was evident that they were probably the other 17 groups of examinees.Right next to the person wearing the white coat, You Huo found a familiar face\u2014\u2014-Shu Xue waved at them with bright eyes and patted the vacant spot next to her to signal them to come over.You Huo nodded his head but just as he was about to go over, Qin Jiu said: \u201cWait a moment.\u201dThen, under the gaze of the other examinees, he dragged a suitcase in from outside the cave.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe examinees instantly went crazy.They burst into loud discussions.An examinee didn\u2019t suppress his voice so his words were especially clear: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.Were you pulled in while you were on a business trip? It\u2019s already the third exam yet you\u2019re still dragging around a suitcase. It\u2019s no wonder you\u2019re second last!\u201dAs soon as he said that, everyone suddenly fell silent.They had arrived earlier and had already introduced themselves, so they all knew each other very well. With the arrival of You Huo and Qin Jiu, everyone in the cave knew that the sacrifices were here.It was okay just thinking that, but it was very awkward saying it out loud.This was particularly the case when it is said in front of the two involved parties. It was suffocatingly awkward.The person who misspoke was a very young man. He was probably the same age as Yu Wen and had a head of hair that was both permed and dyed grey.He looked down and coughed a few times to hide his embarrassment. He then whispered to his companion: \u201cI\u2019m doomed. I got too excited\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dUnexpectedly, You Huo acted like he didn\u2019t hear him.As for Qin Jiu who was one step behind him, he conversely smiled in amusement.Shu Xue whispered: \u201cScared me to death. I thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to follow you! I was super happy seeing your names earlier.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Qin Jiu joked: \u201cMy teammate doesn\u2019t seem to be very happy. Look at that green expression of his.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right let me introduce you. This is my partner.\u201d Shu Xue pointed to the woman in the white coat next to her, \u201cHer name is Wu Li, a neurosurgeon. You guys probably saw it on the ranking list, but she is very powerful.\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesYou Huo\u2019s gaze once again fell onto the woman in the white coat.Wu Li had rather plain and simple features. With a petite figure, she gave off a clean impression despite the chaotic environment they\u2019re in.The only thing that didn\u2019t fit with her image was her hair. It was short and messy, like it was recently cut off.You Huo only briefly glanced at her and didn\u2019t look too long.Wu Li wasn\u2019t a very lively or enthusiastic person, nor was she good at chatting. When she looked at others, it gave them a feeling as if they were being examined.She looked at You Huo with that kind of gaze for a moment and then she similarly looked at Qin Jiu before nodding: \u201cHello.\u201dWithout even waiting for their response, she looked away.Shu Xue recalled their ranking and was a little worried: \u201cOh yeah, did you hear the exam rules announced just now?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cVery clearly.\u201d\u201cThen you also saw the people carried out?\u201d Shu Xue didn\u2019t have a good expression. She was both upset and worried: \u201cThey\u2019re all crew members. Eight in total\u2026\u2026.\u201dThis meant that a few hours later at midnight, if the rankings don\u2019t change, the final ranked group would be doomed.Shu Xue quietly introduced the others present.Not far from them, the two doomed ones; Chen Fei and Huang Rui, had already lost their soul. They sat there in daze for a very long time.Surprisingly, the young grey-haired teen and the companion he was whispering to was currently ranked first with 42 points.The grey-haired teen\u2019s name was Di Li. It is said that, like Yu Wen, he had just turned eighteen. (KKnotes: Another homonym. This time his name sounds like Geography.)The walls inside the cave also displayed the rankings.You Huo looked away and suddenly asked: \u201cWhere are they?\u201dShu Xue was confused: \u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThe captain and the crew. The ones on those merchant ships.\u201d\u201cAll in here.\u201d Shu Xue pointed behind her.You Huo followed the direction of her finger.Only now he noticed that there was another hole inside connecting the space they\u2019re in with another space.A fire was set up inside and its light reflected off the stone walls.But the fire was very weak. It was as if it would go out at any time.\u201cThey can shelter from the wind there. It\u2019s small so it\u2019s also a little warmer.\u201d Shu Xue said, \u201cThe captain and the crew are all there. Before you came, we counted. There\u2019s a total of 36 people, exactly the same as us. Now\u2026.there are only 28 left.\u201d\u201cWhat happened to the 8 that died? Was it from injuries or hunger?\u201d You Huo asked.\u201cWe asked the crew. I guess the cause for it is everything. They were both cold and hungry and there are also some who are sick and injured.\u201d Shu Xue said.\u201cThe temperature here is too low and too cold. If you can\u2019t maintain your body temperature, you would need to sustain it with food, but their food source is also limited. Faced with constant hunger, their resistance lowered.\u201d An examinee added.\u201cThat is to say, in order to ensure that they can leave alive, they need to find fire first and then food?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cNo, find medicine first.\u201dWu Li suddenly spoke up.\u201cHuh?\u201dWu Li said: \u201cThe crew members are hurt. It was caused by a beast attack.\u201dShu Xue quietly exclaimed: \u201cWhat? There are beasts here too?\u201dEveryone glanced vigilantly at the cave entrance.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Wu Li said flatly: \u201cBut several of the deceased died from infection. Being both cold and hungry, the wounds also wouldn\u2019t heal. The remaining crew members are also in similar situations. Without medicine, they won\u2019t survive.\u201dThe white coat she wore made her words sound even more convincing.Everyone was lost: \u201cFinding fire and food is possible but where do we go to find medicine?\u201dThe grey-haired teen Di Li suddenly said: \u201cThe merchant ship has it.\u201dEveryone was stunned: \u201cWhat?\u201dDi Li said: \u201cFrom 1596 to 1598 a Dutch captain\u2026..if I recall correctly, he was called Barentz, was trapped in a place in the Arctic Circle. With a total of 18 people, the captain and crew survived the arctic conditions for 8 months. They relied on hunting for food and they used their fur for clothes. Once the fuel ran out, the ships deck was burned to keep them warm. It was said that there were food, clothes and medicine in the cargo, but they didn\u2019t touch it. In the end, a total of 8 crew members died. Once spring finally came, they were able to deliver the goods safely to their destination.\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesBefore anyone could react, he sniffled and added: \u201cIt was a question that appeared in my high school exam.\u201dDespite both having just completed their university entrance examination, Di Li and Yu Wen were on completely different spectrums.He still remembered questions from his high school papers whereas Yu Wen could only spit out \u201cTang, Song, Yuan, Ming, Qing\u201d.\u201cI remembered that question as soon as I came here.\u201d Di Li said: \u201cBut it probably isn\u2019t exactly the same. Firstly, the number of people is different. The original question said a total of 8 people died but that probably won\u2019t be the case here. As for whether the ship will have it, we will have to check it out.\u201d\u201cThere are.\u201dA lethargic voice responded.You Huo looked over at the source of the sound.It was a crew member who had just carried one of the bodies out.They just finished sorting their companions out and were slowly returning back inside the cave.Of those people, one was an Asian looking man sporting a short buzzcut. When he opened his mouth, Chinese was spoken.He coughed a few times and stared unwaveringly at Di Li. His expression was stubborn: \u201cWe have medicine on board but they\u2019re all cargo. No one can touch them.\u201dDi Li: \u201cWe also don\u2019t want to touch it but we\u2019re doing this to save you! If you don\u2019t use it, you won\u2019t be able to survive. Don\u2019t you understand?\u201dThe man: \u201cSo what if we can\u2019t survive? What you\u2019re doing is an insult to us.\u201dDi Li: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAs they spoke, the other crew members came over.All their heads turned to look over at Di Li.Di Li\u2019s companion tried to ease the atmosphere: \u201cNo, no. That\u2019s your ship after all so we naturally won\u2019t touch it without permission. We were just worried about you.\u201dSeveral of the crew members whispered a few things before giving them a look of warning.\u201cWhat did they say?\u201dThe man with the short buzzcut said sternly: \u201cThey said, we will never use any of the goods for private use. Not a single hair on it can be touched. This is a rule that has been passed down from generation to generation. Whoever breaks this rule is making all of us their enemy. We are not afraid to fight.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dEveryone\u2019s expression was particularly colourful. They internally thought: Who the fuck would want to fight you? If anyone dies, we would have to take responsibility.\u201cOkay, okay. We won\u2019t do anything. Whoever touches it will be punished!\u201d Everyone reassured them.The man with the buzzcut had exhausted his strength speaking. He lowered his eyes and waved at the crew members: \u201cLet\u2019s go, go inside.\u201dHe was probably the first officer. At the very least, the crew members listened to him.They lined up and went through the narrow hole one after another.The man with the buzzcut stood at the very end of the line. He couldn\u2019t help but emphasise again to everyone: \u201cWe check the goods every morning and night. If anything is missing, we will look for you to settle the debt. Medicine are scarce so we remember every single one of them. Don\u2019t even think about trying to fool us. If you want to touch them, you will have to step over our dead bodies first.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dIn this deadlock situation, a \u2018click\u2019 was suddenly heard.Everyone turned around and found the source of the sound\u2014\u2014\u2013Qin Jiu opened his very eye-catching suitcase and picked out a box from inside.\u201cFortunately, I came prepared.\u201dHe bent down and placed the box in front of Wu Li. With two slender fingers, he pushed the box closer by another half an inch before making a \u2018here\u2019 gesture.Wu Li froze for a moment. She opened the box.Everyone stretched their necks curiously to look inside.Inside that box were three neatly arranged boxes of medicine; anti-inflammatories, antibiotics and antipyretics. There was also a bottle of vitamins stuffed in the corner.Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dYou Huo glanced at it: \u201cYou\u2019re experienced. Would you call this having a cheat?\u201d\u201cBefore going to the rest stop, 922 dramatically wrote a shopping list for me. Of course, I didn\u2019t use it and he naturally didn\u2019t know about this. Maybe he was preparing me for the unexpected?\u201dQin Jiu didn\u2019t hesitate to throw is men under the bus.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dOn the sea, inside a brightly lit cabin.922 sneezed consecutively eight times.154 pulled out a few tissues and used it to wipe his face. He asked with disgust: \u201cIf you\u2019re sick, can you go up to the deck? The air in the cabin is not cycled. Do you realise you can infect others?\u201d922: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not sick. I think someone must be thinking about me.\u201d154 rolled his eyes: \u201cGhosts are thinking about you.\u201d\u201cSpeaking of ghosts\u2026\u2026..\u201d 922 wrinkled his face. He looked like he had just swallowed a bitter melon: \u201cThere is a god of misfortune in this exam. Do you think he will be come here again?\u201d154 thought for a moment and said: \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. Boss is there with him. If I\u2019m not mistaken, they should be in the same group. Do you think he would dare break the rules with an invigilator next to him?\u201d922: \u201cOh\u2026\u2026That\u2019s true.\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Are you sure about that 154 and 922?? \ud83e\udd2d\ud83e\udd2dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Here you go~You Seem DeliciousChapter 40: Distressed InvigilatorsWhen the examinees entered the centre, the ship crew saw them as uninvited guests and didn\u2019t have a good expression on their face.Of course, it would be impossible for them to have a good expression after living on a remote island like this for eight whole months.Now that the examinees were providing them with medicine, their attitudes changed significantly.To express their appreciation, the ship crew decided to share their fire with the examines. With this, everyone huddled into the inner cave..The cave was very small. As soon as the examinees entered, all the remaining space inside was filled.The man with the buzzcut gestured for everyone to quieten down: \u201cThe captain stayed up all night. Try to keep quiet and avoid waking him up.\u201dHe pointed at a figure in the corner.It was a middle-aged man. He huddled a little further away allowing the rest of the crew to sit closer to the fire.Facing the fire, he slept with a frown on this face. The light from the fire alone wasn\u2019t enough to change his pale complexion. Instead, it made his sunken cheeks and protruding cheekbones even more prominent.\u201cCaptain?\u201d Di Li assessed that person curiously and whispered: \u201cIs he called Barentsz?\u201dSeveral crew members looked at him strangely.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Di Li panicked. He quickly added: \u201cI was just\u2014\u2014\u201dBefore he could finish, a young crew member exclaimed with surprise: \u201cHow did you know? Are you a wizard?\u201dDi Li was extremely pleased. He flashed his canine: \u201cI\u2019m a werewolf.\u201dThe man with the buzzcut spoke slowly: \u201cWerewolf? Oh, I don\u2019t know if your lying or speaking the truth\u2026\u2026.In any case, no matter what you are, you should be careful. It\u2019s okay on this island but if you go out you will be caught and burned on a stake.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dDi Li\u2019s grin stiffened..Wu Li gave the crew members a simple examination. A total of fourteen of them were wounded, including the man with the buzzcut and Captain Barentsz.While this lady worked, she hated being watched by others.But because the medications were supplied by You Huo and Qin Jiu, she made an exception for them.And it was also because she needed someone to hold down these putrid smelling beings.For example, the anti-inflammatory medications.They came in injection vials. In a box of twelve vials, a single needle was supplied. With no option to change needles for each person, she could only rely on using the fire to disinfect the needle.When Wu Li unscrewed the cap from the needle, the crew members slowly backed away while murmuring suspiciously. But before they could take more than a few steps, they were stopped by You Huo from behind. Immediately, there was a look of despair on their faces.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Wu Li asked with a stern expression.The crew members felt that she didn\u2019t look like she was there to save them and was instead going to kill them.The first officer with the buzzcut explained: \u201cThey\u2019re saying that your medical treatment is too strange. Normal doctors wouldn\u2019t use something like that to draw water.\u201dWu Li\u2019s action stopped: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Draw water?\u201dThe man with the buzzcut could keenly sense her dissatisfaction. He quickly added: \u201cIt\u2019s just a description. Don\u2019t take it too seriously.\u201dWu Li remained stern: \u201cWhat do their doctors normally do? Tell me.\u201dOne of the crew members gestured around and even made some sounds: \u201cPa\u2014\u2014\u2013pa\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dThe man with the buzzcut explained simply: \u201cThey would generally use a thin rod and use it to whip the patient.\u201dWu Li: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do they do?\u201d Shu Xue didn\u2019t understand.Qin Jiu explained it even more succinctly: \u201cSending them to their deaths faster.\u201dShu Xue: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dYou Huo mocked him: \u201cYou\u2019re really good at summarising.\u201dQin Jiu smiled and said: \u201cThank you.\u201dThe crew member gestured again.The first officer with the buzzcut continued to explain: \u201cOr they would do bloodletting. Many doctors would choose to do that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dDr. Wu couldn\u2019t no longer continue listening to all this foreign nonsense. She said to You Huo and Qin Jiu: \u201cHelp me hold them down. I don\u2019t think I can do it alone. Thanks.\u201dJust as Shu Xue wanted to go over, it was as if Wu Li had a pair of eyes on the back of her head: \u201cYou go and sit back down.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d The fake pregnant woman felt wronged to death.When the crew members heard that they were going to forcefully treat them, they all tried to slip away.The other examinees didn\u2019t remain idle and they all worked together to stop them.While they tried to persuade them, they saw Qin Jiu pull out a rope and tie up a crew member in a blink of an eye.He was extremely skilled. A knot was done within three seconds and soon he had tied up a group of them.There were seven in total. This group of people were sent straight over to Dr. Wu.Just as he was about to tie up the eighth one, a long and slender hand interrupted.It was You Huo.This great master used his hand as a knife. With quick and precise attacks, he knocked out all the other crew members with a karate chop behind their head leaving only the man with the buzzcut behind to act as translator.The man with the buzzcut was dumbfounded.Wu Li looked at the pile of unconscious people laying on the ground. She almost couldn\u2019t maintain her stiff expression.She sighed and began to treat them one by one..You Huo noticed that the wounds on the crew members were strange.Some were flesh wounds while others had bruises on their backs or arms. Because it had been left there for a long time without recovering, it began to turn black and blue. It was quite a shocking sight.It wasn\u2019t something caused by a beast\u2019s claws, let alone a bite.But in this place covered in snow and ice, could it be caused by something like polar bears or arctic wolves?What kind of beast would leave behind injuries like these?While the man with the buzzcut was still conscious, You Huo asked him.He sighed and said: \u201cI also don\u2019t know. None of us do.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIn fact, this only started happening recently\u2026..\u201d The man with the buzzcut said.By recently, he meant that it started about ten days ago.That day, they happened to find a group of fish under some ice and managed to fish up a heap and eat their fill.It was one of those rare lucky days for them on the secluded island. After eating, they warmed themselves around the fire and chatted about things they were looking forward to once they returned.Eventually, they ended up falling asleep.When they were startled awake again, the fire they sat around had somehow gone out and the cave they were in was completely dark.They heard a scream. It came from right beside the man with the buzzcut.\u201cFortunately, my hand moved fasted than my thoughts. My first reaction was to reach over and grab him.\u201d The man with the buzzcut said: \u201cAnd perhaps it was because I was lucky, I managed to grab onto his ankle. At that time, he was being dragged out the cave by something. It was very strong. I called for everyone else to help but it was useless. All of us were almost dragged out together.This persisted until the fire was set up again.The force dragging them out suddenly weakened causing them to collapse into a pile.\u201cThe next day, the places we were dragged at became like this.\u201d The man with buzzcut sighed, \u201cAfter that, we didn\u2019t dare extinguish the fire. As long as someone was around, there had to be fire, so we took turns to keep it alight. It was just that we sometimes couldn\u2019t maintain it.\u201d\u201cWe later realised that the larger the fire, the safer we were and so the amount of fuel and firewood used doubled.\u201d\u201cWhen the fuel ran out, we had to dismantle a part of the deck to burn. It was enough to last us until the snow melted. We planned to stop it today.\u201cNo.\u201d Wu Li interrupted: \u201cYou can\u2019t stop the fire.\u201dEveryone looked at her.She said: \u201cJust taking medication is not enough, the body temperature must be maintained. Once the fire is extinguished, the temperature inside the cave would plummet within a few minutes and all that medication you took would be for nothing. You not only need fire; it needs to be stronger. It\u2019s best to light one both on the inside and outside cave to ensure that the optimal temperature is maintained.\u201d\u201cI understand the theory behind that but it\u2019s a bit difficult to put into action.\u201d One examinee said: \u201cI looked around when I came. This island is almost completely empty.\u201d\u201cIf worse comes to worse, you can use the merchant ship.\u201d Di Li\u2019s memory of the exam question was so good, he even remembered that the merchant ship was made from wood.The man with the buzzcut was anxious: \u201cNo! You can\u2019t touch the cargo! If you touched it, we won\u2019t have any dignity when we return. The captain said that he would throw himself into the sea if anything happened to the cargo and I have the same thoughts as him.\u201dEveryone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dDi Li quickly said: \u201cWe won\u2019t touch the cargo. We know that your cargo is more important than your life. I studied about this topic for a whole year. I meant dismantling the deck!\u201d\u201cThe deck can no longer be dismantled.\u201d The man with the buzzcut said: \u201cIf you dismantled more of it, the ship can no longer be used. All the cargo inside would be damaged by the wind and rain so the final outcome would still be us throwing ourselves into the sea.\u201dDi Li: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWhy do you have so many reasons to die?\u201cNot even one?\u201d Everyone tried to bargain.The man with the buzzcut: \u201cNo, and it won\u2019t be enough anyway.\u201d.Inside the cave, a fire about the size of a fist flickered. It was smaller than before.\u201cOh no, it\u2019s about to go out.\u201d Although Di Li was young, he was at the top of the scoreboard, so he felt that it was his destiny to act as the examinees\u2019 representative.He patted off the dirt from his butt and stood up: \u201cHow about this? A group of use will try and see if we can find branches on the island while the other group will follow this unc\u2014\u2013\u201dMan with the buzzcut: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201c\u2014\u2014-big brother to the merchant ship to take a look. Perhaps they may have been some that were overlooked? Even if it\u2019s just one piece of wood, it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201dEveryone else was older than him. They all gave him some leeway.What\u2019s more, this kid\u2019s words also made a lot of sense. Everyone formed groups and did as he said.Wu Li stayed behind to take care of the wounded.Wanting to also go out, Shu Xue internally prepared several excuses.She had wanted to follow You Huo and Qin Jiu to see if she could be of any help. Afterall, those two knew that she wasn\u2019t really pregnant so she wouldn\u2019t be a burden on them.Unexpectedly, these two great masters were sauntering slowly at the end of the group. Before they left the cave, they stopped Shu Xue.You Huo: \u201cI\u2019m going to look around alone.\u201dQin Jiu glanced at him: \u201cWhat a coincidence. So am I.\u201dYou Huo oh\u2019ed and then indicated at the cave entrance with his chin: \u201cDifferent ways. You can go.\u201dQin Jiu poked his cheek with his tongue. After thinking for a few seconds, he narrowed his eyes and said: \u201cAlright then.\u201dAfter Qin Jiu left, You Huo turned around.Shu Xue asked with concern: \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t need any help? It\u2019ll be difficult finding firewood in this place. I don\u2019t want to sit around while everyone is working hard but if it\u2019s not convenient for you, I can stay back with Wu Li.\u201dYou Huo said: \u201cIt\u2019s not bothersome. At most, it\u2019ll just be a little more work.\u201dShu Xue: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe waved his hand and turned around to leave. When he reached the exit, he turned back and said: \u201cYou should just stay here. Keep an eye on that person\u2019s suitcase.\u201dAfter that, he added: \u201cEats a lot.\u201dShu Xue: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Oh.\u201d.Under the twilight, the ships used to drop the examinees off were neatly anchored around the island. A short distance away from those ships were the three merchant ships mentioned in the question.According to the examination rules that were announced, these ships would sail off again once the exam is successfully completed to take the examinees away from the examination centre.And so, there shouldn\u2019t be anyone around.But at this moment, a tall figure suddenly appeared on the deck of one of those ships.He had just climbed up the rope ladder and was searching around near the steering wheel looking for tools.It was You Huo who said earlier that he wanted to look around alone.He was looking for the long hook he used earlier on the ship.He recalled leaving it there, but he somehow couldn\u2019t find it.You Huo looked around and eventually lost his patience. He found a small dagger slightly longer than his hand and decided to use that instead.He used his finger to feel for a gap between the wood on the deck and inserted the knife between the planks. Just as he was about to pry it apart, a cracking sound was heard from within the cabin.There\u2019s someone else around?You Huo was stunned for a moment. He then frowned and walked over to the stairs. Using his feet, he kicked open the trap door.He had thought that he would see that old captain inside but instead he saw Qin Jiu\u2026\u2026The other party was holding the missing metal hook in one hand and with the other hand he was breaking off a wooden board.With a thud, the wooden board fell to the side. There was already a small pile of wood there.Qin Jiu heard movements above. Twirling the metal hook around and resting it on his shoulder, he looked up: \u201cWhat a coincidence top student. You\u2019re also here to explore the ship?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe looked on through his half-lidded eyes for a moment. He then squatted down next to the trap door with the dagger.\u201cDo you still remember that you\u2019re an invigilator?\u201d He looked down at Qin Jiu from above and asked.Qin Jiu laughed: \u201cReally? I seem to recall something like that. But right now, I\u2019m moreso your comrade, don\u2019t you think?\u201dYou Huo looked down at him for a moment. He eventually snorted: \u201cAlright.\u201d.Half an hour later.Di Li and the others gradually returned to the cave in groups. They brought back their hard-earned loot: Two bundles of soaked branches and three pieces of wood from the deck that was exchanged for with their lives.That was it.It was clearly not enough.While everyone was clearly not happy, one examinee sitting closest to the entrance of the cave suddenly stood up.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Everyone became nervous.\u201cI heard something\u2026\u2026..Wait, I\u2019ll go and see!\u201d The examinee said this and rushed out.Less than a minute later, he returned.\u201cFuck\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe first thing he said when he returned was a curse. He then took two deep breaths.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Don\u2019t gasp and tell us!\u201d\u201cThose two ranked second last!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThey brought a huge pile of wood back. It\u2019s outside!\u201d\u201cA huge pile? How is that possible? Where did it come from?\u201d Di Li had already rushed out before he could finish speaking.The moment he rushed outside, he heard the examinee say: \u201cThey got it from the ship! They dismantled the systems ship!\u201dDi Li: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dWhat???More than thirty examinees rushed out the cave and were immediately shocked by the large pile of wood before them.Before they could close their mouths, the dead rabbit outside the cave came back to life:\u3010Examinee You Huo and Qin Jiu violated the rules by dismantling the system\u2019s ship.

He said to Di Li who flew out from the cave: \u201cTake this pile in first.\u201dAfter that, he walked away again with his dagger.Directly opposite the cave, a system ship sat there pitifully. Judging from the gaps and openings on the side of the ship, it was probably the ship that was pathetically pulled apart.And You Huo was walking towards it.Di Li was dumbfounded for a moment. He quickly shouted out: \u201cWait a minute. What are you doing now?\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t hear him.\u201cWhat did he mean?\u201d Di Li asked his companion, \u201cThe invigilators are coming so shouldn\u2019t they be waiting here? Write something to reflect on their wrongdoings or figure out a way to settle the problem? Apologise to the ship?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t keep up with the thoughts of these two young ones.\u201d His companion was a lot older than him. He said: \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can ask for pardon when the invigilators arrive.\u201dDi Li said: \u201cYeah. Uncle Li, were you in the legal field before? You\u2019re really good at speaking.\u201dHis companion spoke with frustration: \u201cI\u2019m just over 35. Who\u2019s your uncle?\u201dDi Li: \u201cHabit, habit. I didn\u2019t mean to call you old. I\u2019ve just been so used to calling those older than me uncle and aunty and haven\u2019t adapted to the change after entering university\u2026\u2026..\u201dHis companion could neither laugh or cry: \u201cWhat adapt\u2014\u2014- What\u2019s that noise?\u201dThe sound of wooden planks being broken off interrupted them.Everyone was stunned for a few seconds. They looked over at the source of the noise.On the system ship not far away, You Huo was standing on the side of the ship throwing down a few more broken boards.Behind him, the tall mast suddenly tilted. Together with the sails, it collapsed down onto the ship with a bang, startling everyone into closing their eyes.When they opened their eyes again, they saw Qin Jiu stand up near the point where the mast broke. He took the dagger from You Huo and cleanly cut off the rope before lifting his foot and kicking the mast aside.Please read this from kk translatesIt tumbled down the ship.You Huo bent down and disappeared for a moment. When he reappeared by the side of the ship again, he again began to throw things out.Chairs\u2026\u2026Table\u2026\u2026.Wooden box\u2026\u2026.And even a fucking cabinet.Thirty plus examines stood there in daze like emperor penguins.What repent and admitting to your mistakes? Since it was already a violation, they had just decided to dismantle everything!As long as it can be burned, nothing would be left behind.The small white ship occupied by the invigilators slowly appeared. Four invigilators stood at the bow.Under the looks of everyone, Qin Jiu waved at the invigilators before turning around and throwing a ship rudder out.Examinees: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dDi Li turned to look at his companion: \u201cBrother Li\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dBrother Li: \u201c\u2026\u2026.Just call me uncle. Looks like words won\u2019t save them from this mess.\u201d.On the small white ship, 922 stared ahead. His mouth twitched: \u201cI\u2019m seasick.\u201d154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d922: \u201cExtremely dizzy and sick. I can no longer stand. Can I go back to the cabin and rest?\u201d154: \u201cShut up. I\u2019m also feeling sick.\u201dThe newcomer 078: \u201c?\u201d922: \u201cDon\u2019t look at us like that. It\u2019s not true sickness. You don\u2019t understand yet. You\u2019ll find out soon.\u201d078 stretched his neck. Readjusting his sunglasses, he said calmly: \u201cWhat kind of examinees haven\u2019t I seen?\u201d922 stared at him.078: \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about 001, that is an exception. I\u2019m referring those other than him.\u201d922 scoffed.The other new invigilator was a tall woman. She had shoulder length hair and one side was tucked behind her ear. Large earrings hanging from her ears swayed with the wind.She wore a pair of sunglasses even larger than 078\u2019s and said: \u201cWho was the one whose legs shook for ten minutes back in the cabin when they heard that we\u2019re capturing 001?\u201d078: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d.The bow of the small white ship came into contact with You Huo and Qin Jiu\u2019s ship.You Huo threw out one last thing before patting off the dust from his hands and squinted over at the small white ship.A ladder was taken out. Four invigilators walked over.You Huo: \u201cWhat material is the invigilators ship made from?\u201dQin Jiu chuckled: \u201cWhy? You dare to tear it down?\u201d\u201cIf you want to demolish the invigilators ship then I won\u2019t accompany you.\u201d Qin Jiu stepped around the damaged parts of the deck: \u201cAfterall, my subordinates are there.\u201dAs soon as he said that, he said to the four invigilators standing not far away: \u201cHere to give us more wood?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe faces of three of the four invigilators instantly turned green.021\u2019s sunglasses were too big for them to tell if it was green or not.\u201cThe four are all your people?\u201d You Huo\u2019s light-coloured eyes glanced over.Qin Jiu shook his head: \u201cThat\u2019s not the case. The two with sunglasses are under 009.\u201d\u201cThere are so many chief invigilators?\u201dQin Jiu said: \u201cYou can\u2019t say that there are a lot. From 001 to 010, there are a total of ten. Each would lead a team of 10 and the invigilators under the chief invigilators are randomly assigned. It\u2019s mainly myself and 009 here in China though. The others are responsible for other locations.\u201d\u201cIs there a problem with your reputation?\u201d You Huo suddenly asked.Qin Jiu raised an eyebrow: \u201cSays who?\u201dYou Huo\u2019s eyes fell onto the only female invigilator and said: \u201cThat person seems to have something against you.\u201dThere was no need to mention 154 and 922. 078 had taken off his sunglasses after boarding the ship and had given Qin Jiu a small nod. While maintaining the sternness invigilators were expected to possess, he showed a some politeness.The only exception was 021.All this time, she didn\u2019t move to take off her sunglasses let alone show any signs of being polite.Qin Jiu looked over at 021: \u201cShe has something against me? Why can\u2019t I see it?\u201dYou Huo internally commented: It\u2019s probably because you\u2019re blind.\u201cBut even if she does, it\u2019s not necessarily because of my reputation. It is said that according to the original allocations, she was supposed to become A\u2019s subordinate but before she was able to officially join the team, A was gone. She later almost joined my team, but I was recuperating for a while so she went to 009. Perhaps she had heard some rumours and subconsciously is biased against me?\u201dQin Jiu thought for a moment and then laughed and said: \u201cWe\u2019re not close so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dAlmost became a part of his team yet he never asked about it?You Huo felt that Qin Jiu was very strange.As the chief invigilator 001, he should be an inseparable part of that stupid system but judging from his words, he could sense that he didn\u2019t like the system and didn\u2019t want to be too deeply involved with it.It wasn\u2019t just the system itself, it was also with the other invigilators..154 and 922 stood opposite Qin Jiu and You Huo. Both had uncomfortable expressions.Who would\u2019ve expected this\u2026\u2026\u2026.For thirty years, people east of the river prosper, then for another thirty years those on the west prosper. (KKnotes: Proverb basically saying that the world changes so fast, it is always beyond our expectations and therefore can\u2019t precisely predict the future.)Their former boss was now being send to be imprisoned\u2026\u2026..Yet the one being imprisoned was still smiling.154 internally expressed that he must have committed atrocious crimes in his past life for him to be punished into working as an invigilator in this life.Silence lasted for several seconds.Please read this from kk translates078 stood there for a while and finally could no longer keep still.He looked to the left. The mouths of his two colleagues 154 and 922 appeared to have been sewed shut.He then looked to the right. Forget it, he shouldn\u2019t mess with 021.He cleared his throat. With a stern expression, he said: \u201cTen minutes ago, we received a notice from the system saying that the two of you have dismantled a system ship used for transporting examinees. Damages were made to the deck\u2026\u2026\u2026.furniture, mast, rudder, stairs\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dHis lips twitched for a moment. He then continued when it stopped: \u201cCan the two of you please board this invigilator ship?\u201dYou Huo oh\u2019ed, \u201cWhat\u2019s the punishment this time?\u201d078: \u201c???\u201dHe turned to look at his colleague. 922 mouthed: \u201cOld customer.\u201d078: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe thought for a moment and said: \u201cAs it is the first violation for this exam, according to the rules it will be 3 hours of solitary confinement. It\u2019s probably not the first time for you? Since you know how it works, you should mentally prepare yourself.\u201dWhen 078 was done speaking, he ushered them up the ladder. He was to watch on from behind.But before he could take more than a few steps, he saw that old customer preparing himself. He asked 922: \u201cDo you have anything to eat?\u201d078 almost lost his footing and fell into the sea.\u201cNo, no food. I didn\u2019t bring any beef! Am I a cafeteria? Why are you ordering food from me?\u201d 922 was afraid of this god of misfortune. In two or three steps, he climbed up the ladder.He threw out a sentence \u201cI\u2019m seasick. I feel really sick.\u201d before sprinting off.154 finally couldn\u2019t watch on anymore. He said: \u201cBoss, to tell you the truth an hour ago 911 and I were saying that since you are here he\u2026\u2026..that examinee wouldn\u2019t violate the rules. Boss, look at me. My face was slapped so hard, it would be swollen soon.\u201dQin Jiu said: \u201cThose who are close to ink also get stained. The examinee was a bad influence.\u201dA particular examinee: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dCan you be more shameless?154 glanced at his boss before similarly running away..With two of the four invigilators slipping away, the numbers withered.078 could only follow 021 and take the rule violators into the ship cabins.The invigilator ship adhered to tradition. Apart from the fact that the exterior was painted white to allow for easy differentiation, the interior was similar to the other ships of this examination centre.There were three floors.The first floor was like those of the system ships. It was composed of compartments sitting opposite each other with a bed, chair and table. They were rooms for the invigilators to use and rest in. Afterall, like the examinees they were required to remain at sea for the entire duration of the exam.The two doors marked 154 and 922 were currently locked. It clearly expressed their intention to stay away from the god of misfortune.The next floor consisted of the dining room and kitchen.Fire was burning in the fireplace, keeping the entire cabin rather warm or even a little hot.Qin Jiu took off the scarf around his neck and held it in his hands.\u201cDo you need me to help you put that away?\u201d 078 began to talk awkwardly.Qin Jiu said: \u201cNo need.\u201dThe awkward conversation ended.078: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe glanced at 012. 012 was still standing there proudly with their sunglasses sitting on her face. She didn\u2019t show any intention to speak up.078 internally sighed. He took You Huo and Qin Jiu down.The lowermost floor of was very confronting. There were only a few rooms that were tightly shut lined down the narrow walkway.078 opened the first door and said to You Huo: \u201cGo in. 021 will come and open the door for you when time is up.\u201dThe layout of the confinement room was no different from before. As usual, there was a table and a chair, nothing else. On the wall was a line of mirrors making the room appear more spacious.You Huo calmly walked in and even closed the door himself after entering.078 stared at the door. He then silently opened the second door and said to Qin Jiu: \u201cUh\u2026\u2026\u201dWithout him needing to say anything, Qin Jiu went in.078 awkwardly coughed and said: \u201cAfter three hours, I will open the door.\u201dAfter that, the door creaked shut.The light from outside was cut off and the room fell into darkness.This darkness only persisted for a moment. It was then quickly replaced by sunlight.Qin Jiu narrowed his eyes and adapted to this change. When he opened it again, he found himself standing in a ruin site.The ruin site was large; much larger than the confinement room itself. It was surrounded by wire mesh protective fencing which circled around. Contained within these fences were rusted cars, scattered machines and broken cables\u2026..Ah, there was also long metal pipes and steels bars on the side.If he bent his leg, sat on those pipes, took off his coat and poured some blood onto the front of his shirt, it would look exactly like that scene in his memory\u2026\u2026.Qin Jiu stood before those metal pipes. His fingers unconsciously twitched a few times and he once again wrapped the scarf around his neck.He tucked the ends of the scarf inside his coat like a gentleman, covering the front of his shirt.For a moment, a thought flashed through his mind.It seemed that\u2026\u2026\u2026this was correct.In this distant, blurry memory, he should be wearing a scarf. It was either black or grey and it just happened to cover the blood on his chest.That person stood before him while he sat on the metal pipes. Except for some signs of exhaustion, he looked like he was unscathed.It seems that\u2026\u2026\u2026this memory is correct.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Slowly revealing their history?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was no invigilator A standing before him.Qin Jiu walked along the protective fences.In the distance outside the ruins was a forest. The tall and straight branches pointed at the sky. Occasionally birds would suddenly become startled and swarm into the forest.On the other side it was a mass of fog and there were some traces of smoke.As an invigilator, Qin Jiu had a good understanding of the confinement rooms.Here, people would be exposed to the most feared event in their life and be forced to experience it repeatedly.He truly believed that this was true because all the examinees who had entered the confinement rooms would wet themselves. Even 154 and the others who had become invigilators feared this place.But now, he felt that it was all just an exaggeration.A field of ruins, a forest and this quiet environment \u2013 What was there to be \u201cfeared\u201d?Of course, the word \u201cfear\u201d could mean many things.As he stood there taking in the ruins and forest, he indeed felt a small sense of emptiness. It was as if\u2026\u2026.it was hard for him to be happy again.But this was far from \u201cfear\u201d.He once thought that the word \u201cfear\u201d had nothing to do with him.Before this, he had always felt that if he entered the confinement room, he would either see a blank space or the room would remain as is.But now, it had become very intriguing.What did that invigilator A do for him to even appear in the scene produced by the confinement room?Qin Jiu wanted to see if he could find some clues in this ruin site.After wandering around for twenty minutes, nothing was found.It probably had something to do with his memory. He could only remember this much so the confinement room naturally couldn\u2019t reveal any more than that. At most, it just helped with bringing out the scenes from within his subconscious..On the second floor of the invigilator ship.While You Huo was confined, 922 slipped out of his room and rushed over to the kitchen downstairs to continue making his smoked chicken and lamb chops.It wasn\u2019t until the sides had turned light brown and the outside had turned crispy causing the cabins to be filled with its delicious scent did 922 recover from his shock of \u201cdetaining his boss\u201d.He squatted behind the wooden cabinet searching for a clean plate. As soon as he looked up, he saw 078 come in following the scent. 078 said: \u201cIt\u2019s not bad working together with you guys. The meals are very different. It\u2019s no wonder 021 chose this team. Did she work with you two before?\u201d\u201cIf you want to eat, wash the dishes first.\u201d 922 shoved four plates into his arms, \u201c021 chose this? Don\u2019t tell me she came over just to see our boss get detained\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so? No one would have expected him to violate the rules. It might be because she wanted to try being 001\u2019s invigilator?\u201d 078 said: \u201cAnyway, there were several groups we could choose from. While I was hesitating, she decided on this one without a moment of thought! This lady has always been decisive.\u201d922 made a sound of acknowledgement and divided the chicken and lamb chops onto the clean dishes: \u201cSo where is Miss Decisive? Tell her it\u2019s time to eat.\u201dPlease read this from kk translates\u201cSitting in the monitoring room.\u201d 078 said.922 was stunned: \u201cWhat\u2019s she doing there?\u201d\u201cWatching.\u201d 078 was even more surprised: \u201cYou guys don\u2019t monitor them?\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201d 922 shook his head.Even that was an exaggeration. In fact, they don\u2019t look at all.Every invigilator\u2019s site would have a monitoring room allowing them to see the inside of the confinement rooms. Everything the examinees experience in the confinement room would be shown on the screen.As for whether an invigilator was required to monitor them, there was no hard and fast rule.Since there was no hard and fast rule, other invigilators interpreted as a \u2018requirement\u2019 while Qin Jiu took it as \u2018unnecessary\u2019.And so, either the monitoring room would be empty, or it would be completely shut off.This time, invigilators from two different teams had come together and they each had their own habits.922 didn\u2019t stop them. He just said: \u201cThen does it mean that you two take turns to eat? Or do you bring the food into the room and eat in there with her? It\u2019s better eating it while its hot and crispy. It won\u2019t taste good once it gets cold.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take it over to her then. She has always been like this.\u201d 078 said: \u201cI won\u2019t eat in there. I have a weak stomach. If I see something bloody or gruesome, I would probably vomit. Are you sure you and 154 aren\u2019t going to watch?\u201d922 held his plate. He felt conflicted.To be honest, he was really curious about what his boss would see in the confinement room.But in the end, his desire to live won over his curiosity.He shook his head and said: \u201cForget it. I\u2019ll get 154 to come eat.\u201d.According to group 9\u2019s usual practices, 078 and 021 worked on a shift-like schedule. For the first half of the day, 021 would watch in the monitoring room and on the second half of the day, it would be 078\u2019s turn.So at this moment, 078 had not yet seen what the two confinement rooms were like.\u201cMiss Decisive, your dinner.\u201d 078 pushed open the door was soon surprised: \u201cWhy are you standing?\u201d021 was standing next to the control pad. She said while looking back: \u201cSitting for too long affects your figure.\u201d078: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Okay then.021 didn\u2019t continue this topic, \u201cWhat did you just call me?\u201d\u201cMiss Decisive. It was a name 922 came up with. I think it\u2019s quite appropriate.\u201d 078 placed the plate on the table, \u201c922 made some fried chicken and I also boiled some vegetables for you. You\u2026\u2026.can stand and eat?\u201d021 pulled over a chair and sat down.She finally removed her sunglasses. Her eyes were beautiful and sharp. She cut off a small piece of chicken and when she was about to eat it, she looked over at 078: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to eat? Or are you waiting for me to collect the plate?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t 078\u2019s first day with her so he was used to her way of speaking and wasn\u2019t upset. He said: \u201cI\u2019m eating. I\u2019ll go back and eat. I was just curious about 001\u2019s room\u2014\u2014-\u201dHe turned around as he said that and saw that one of the monitoring screens was on.The camera was angled down from the corner of the room. It appeared to be a ruin site. Qin Jiu was leaning on a relatively clean metal table\u2026\u2026.reading.078: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe almost pressed his face against the screen to confirm what he saw.He really was reading\u2026\u2026\u2026.or just looking at some leather backed book.Who knows?In short, the chaos and panic he had expected to see wasn\u2019t happening.It took a long time before 078 could utter his next sentence: \u201cIs he there just having a goddamned afternoon tea\u2026\u2026\u2026?\u201d021 slowly chewed on her chicken and hummed in response without raising her head.\u201cWhat about the other one?\u201d 078 again asked, \u201cWhy is only one screen lit up?\u201dMiss 021 had always been particular about not speaking while eating. Her finger painted with dark-red nail polish poked at the screen on the bottom right corner to indicate to 078 the location of the screen.078 again sprawled against the screen.He felt that he had probably gone blind. It was completely dark. There was nothing at all.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening here? Is he afraid of the dark?\u201d021 didn\u2019t speak any nonsense. In one smooth motion, she turned on the night mode.This time 078 could finally see the scene inside the confinement room. That person\u2026\u2026.that examinee who was supposed to be confined in there was lying on the table sleeping like a dead pig.He got closer and listened intently. He could even hear his smooth breathing.078: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dOne was reading, one was sleeping. What was the point of this confinement punishment? Was this humiliating the invigilators or humiliating the system?\u201cForget it. I\u2019m going to eat\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe had been angered until he was hungry. He turned around and headed for the kitchen.The monitoring room became quiet again. 021 swallowed her vegetables and finally raised her eyes. Those beautiful eyes stared intently at the screen..Five minutes later, while the three invigilators were eating lamb chops in the kitchen, 021 came upstairs.\u201cThe monitoring system is broken.\u201d She held her plate and glass and for a moment looked a little innocent.078 swallowed the food in his mouth, \u201cAh? Why did it suddenly break? Wasn\u2019t it fine just now?\u201d021: \u201cI accidentally overturned my glass and water was poured all over the control pad. When I tried to wipe it up, I may have pressed the power button or something.\u201d\u201cWhat now?\u201d 078 said, \u201cReport to the system?\u201d021 was a bit reluctant.That was also normal. No invigilators were willing to anger the system.922 spat out the bones and said: \u201cWe\u2019re out at sea my Brother. What\u2019s the point of reporting? It doesn\u2019t matter if we can\u2019t monitor them. The confinement room is the only place free from the system. Anyway, the confinement room itself is enough punishment for the examinee and the system has not been too intrusive about this. Our team has never looked at it. Not even the red lights turn on.\u201d078 originally wanted to say something but when he thought about the two who are reading a book and sleeping, he felt that there really wasn\u2019t much to see.Please read this from kk translatesIf he watched that long enough, it would probably frustrate him to death.And so, he sat back down and resumed eating the piping hot lamb chops.Now no longer needing to monitor, 078 and 021 joined the others and ate together.They warmed themselves up by the fire and chatted as they checked the time. They only wanted to send away the gods of misfortune as soon as possible..In the second confinement room on the lower floor of the ship, Qin Jiu turned to another page.What he was reading wasn\u2019t a book. It was the Zhao Wentu\u2019s diary that was entrusted to him.He had kept this diary with him the entire time and it was only now that he took it out to read. Afterall, the confinement room was a rather special place.This was the only place in the entire examination system that was not monitored.In other words, every other place including the invigilator\u2019s living area, exam centres and rest stops are under the system\u2019s surveillance. It would always know what everyone was doing right away.The only exception was the confinement rooms.Following the earliest rules of privacy, the systems invisible eyes were not there. There are only the physical surveillance cameras.Once you turned those off, the confinement room would become the most private of places.Of course, access to these rooms were restricted.Only rule violating examinees could enter and invigilators could only enter when dropping off or picking up the examinees..During this rare period of private time, Qin Jiu had already gone through half of the diary.There, Zhao Wentu had made records about every exam he took and every note-worthy person he met.Qin Jiu saw his name in there\u2026\u2026..And he also saw invigilator A.Mathematics Day 2RainYesterday, I almost went crazy. But even after calming down, I still don\u2019t understand. What sin did I commit for me to be dragged into this exam? (I had a peaceful breakup with my last girlfriend. Not a scum.)I would rather drop out of school and repeat the university entrance examination for ten years than taking this shit! At the very least, I wouldn\u2019t be burned to death if I couldn\u2019t solve the math problems in the exam.Oh, but there is also something that\u2019s pretty good. There is a very amazing person in the team called Qin Jiu. It was all thanks to him that we were able to survive yesterday.But he would always step on the examination rule boundaries. I am a little scared. No, the entire team is scared. Everyone except for him.I hope he can hold himself back. Please hold himself back (It\u2019s too scary kneeling before him in person so I\u2019ll kneel in my diary. Thud.)It is currently 10 o\u2019clock at night. I hope we get through the night safely. Good night.Mathematics Day 3RainToday was really nerve-wracking. A teammate was almost burned to death, but Qin Jiu instead burned the monster down. (He really dared to do that\u2026\u2026..)To be honest, it was actually quite exhilarating seeing it happen. It felt like we had just returned from the brink of deathQin Jiu was then taken away. (Our team\u2019s only hope!)Yes, this damned exam actually also has a fucking invigilator. A living one. In short, invigilator A took the rule violating Qin Jiu away. The most ridiculous thing was that he didn\u2019t take it seriously at all and was even teasing the invigilator.That invigilator A was too fucking young. I think he\u2019s probably around my age and a year or two younger than Qin Jiu? That guys charisma though. As soon as he appeared, no one dared to move or speak. (But it may also be because he is an invigilator, so everyone didn\u2019t dare do anything. Everyone except for Qin Jiu.)It is said that the punishment for rule violation was solitary confinement. Qin Jiu said that the fundamental meaning of confinement was to get examinees to sit in the room alone and suffocate from boredom. (But why do I feel that it doesn\u2019t sound right? How scary could sitting in a room alone be?)Anyway, I still hope he can hold on. This exam will take twelve days.It is currently 9:30 at night. Long live Brother Qin. I hope nothing crazy happens tomorrow. Wish me good dreams.Mathematics day 4FineA little girl almost died today. That girl was only six years old and was dragged into doing this disgusting exam. Fucking hell.The little girl gave Brother Qin a candy. Brother Qin then helped her overthrow a question about the auditorium.In the end, the auditorium collapsed so Brother Qin was once again taken away by the invigilator.Today\u2019s invigilator A was also cold. His expression this time however was a bit bad. (Oh no. Because of Brother Qin, I am even no longer feeling nervous. I don\u2019t know if this is a good or bad thing.)I suspect that with these two consecutive trips, invigilator A and Brother Qin would probably put each other on their blacklist.Based on my instincts as a former member of the national defence squad, this invigilator probably used to be in the army. Or at least he had some sort of similar experience. Then wouldn\u2019t that mean that he\u2019s in a similar field as Brother Qin? So that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t get along\u2026\u2026What was even more scary was that Brother Qin said that he would cause more disruptions for the invigilator next time he is detained (since he won\u2019t see this entry, I\u2019ll just say that his actions are called enticing death.) Hmm\u2026.. You couldn\u2019t tell if he was speaking the truth from his expression. In any case, he always spoke like that.Don\u2019t tell me he had gone mad from the confinement?It is now 10 o\u2019clock at night. Sweet dreams.Mathematics day 5FineMy god. We completed the exam\u2026\u2026\u2026But as soon as we left the exam centre Qin Jiu was again taken away by the invigilator.For a moment, I didn\u2019t know who I was more worried about.Forget it. I just hope I can meet Brother Qin again in the next exam.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: LOL Qin Jiu has been breaking the rules since long agoPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Qin Jiu occupied more space in the entries than he himself.Perhaps it was because of the dangerous environment at that time and the fact that Qin Jiu was too outstanding in the team, he became the most memorable person in the diary.However, this was only comparatively speaking.Zhao Wentu\u2019s diary wasn\u2019t very detailed. At least, it wasn\u2019t enough for others to imagine the events.But several times Qin Jiu felt a faint sense of familiarity.It was as if those forgotten memories could be remembered if he read more of the entries.Qin Jiu read on.However, over the next few days Zhao Wentu only mentioned him a few times.Because while the others went to the rest stop after completing the exam, Qin Jiu didn\u2019t go and was getting punished at the invigilators place\u2026..It wasn\u2019t until a few pages later that his name appeared again.Exam break day 5FineThe same thing happened to me again this morning.As soon as I pulled open the curtains and saw the high-rise buildings outside, I would always feel as if I had just woken up after a nap at home.This rest stop is too deceiving. They might as well throw us into the wilderness. At least that way I wouldn\u2019t get confused and it wouldn\u2019t make me lose my spirit all morning.It is said that there are more than one rest stops. We were lucky and ended up in one of the more bustling city-like ones. Just this morning, Old Li even found a chess and card centre. It really was a chess and card centre. They even had mah-jong and poker. (Even I find it quite ridiculous as I write this)In a world that is trying to kill us as we complete exams, there was actually something as grounded as a chess and card centre\u2026\u2026.Old Li and the others put together a mah-jong table. (They\u2019re pretty amazing. There\u2019s an internet caf\u00e9 opposite us but I remained calm) I didn\u2019t know how to play, and I wasn\u2019t interested so I slipped out.When I went downstairs for dinner at four or five in the afternoon, they were still playing. They didn\u2019t even have lunch. In a way, they were a little too entranced. Just the thought of it was scary, but it was also understandable\u2026\u2026I was feeling a little annoyed afterwards, so I wandered around to gather my thoughts. Using my phone, I filmed my surroundings. (Being able to use the phone in the rest stop was probably the only source of comfort for me. It just can\u2019t connect to the normal world\u2019s internet dammit.) I wonder if these videos would become filled with pixels once I complete the exam and return to the normal world? Afterall, I also took some of the invigilator.On the street next to the mall, Brother Qin was together with invigilator A. When my camera swept over, I was taken aback.How should I put it? In any case, whenever I see the two of them, I would always feel as if knifes would suddenly be thrown around. (My Chinese can no longer be saved. What am I going to do if I end up getting this subject?) Although Brother Qin was smiling\u2026\u2026For some reason, it looked like the two were completely hostile to each other.Invigilator A didn\u2019t stay for long and left within a few seconds. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t see me recording the video. If he did, he would have probably thrown me a rule violation offence.Brother Qin said that his punishment was over and invigilator A was just following the rules and sending him back to the rest stop. It was said that he dropped him off by car. It was also said that he did it very reluctantly and would deliberately take detours into the remote wilderness. (Although there are many places like that in this damned place, I still think the invigilator did that because he wanted to kill him)At night, I went with Brother Qin together to the mall. I only bought a retractable fruit knife while he filled a small suitcase.I suspect that we are not in the same world. I came here to take the exam while he\u2019s here on holiday.Why is there such a big difference between people?Having had my thoughts interrupted by these things, my mood was no longer so bad.I don\u2019t know if I would be able to be in the same exam as Brother Qin for the next one but, regardless, I hope to be a little stronger. I am after all someone who has done this before.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netPS: My diary entries are recently getting longer and longer. It might be because I\u2019ve been idle the past few days, so I\u2019ve been thinking more. We\u2019ve also discussed about this for a long time, but we eventually couldn\u2019t figure out who could be responsible for making this system, what their intentions are and why we were dragged in. Old Li said that it\u2019s pointless thinking about this right now and that we should focus on staying alive.\u2026\u2026.But I still want to figure it out. How could it be considered living if you don\u2019t even know the reason behind what you\u2019re doing?It is now midnight. We\u2019re another day closer to the next exam. I wish us all good luck and that we can survive and figure out what\u2019s going on. Good night..This entry of Zhao Wentu\u2019s covered several pages. Qin Jiu pressed his finger on one of the pages.His eyes lingered on a certain line for a long time. A fuzzy scene suddenly flashed past in his mind\u2026\u2026It appeared to be at night. Before him was a car, a black one. The light from the streetlight was reflected on the window and you could faintly see the silhouette of the person inside.It was very strange. The time, place and also the car was unclear and indistinct, yet that window was exceptionally clear in this scene.He leaned onto the roof of the car with one hand and knocked on the window.He couldn\u2019t remember what mood he was feeling at that time. Was it amusement? Picking a fight? Provocation?Anyway, he waited for a while, but the window didn\u2019t lower. Instead, the horn went off.He also no longer remembered the meaning behind the horn.Perhaps the person inside was provoking him back? Asking him to move aside and get lost? Or did it mean something else?He straightened up and the car then drive off without looking back.That scene was like a bird swooping past. When he tried to recall it, he could only catch the final fleeting shadow\u2014\u2014\u2013He crossed his arms and leaned against the streetlight as he watched the car disappear in the distance.\u2026\u2026\u2026..In confinement room 1 next door.A finger resting on the back of You Huo\u2019s neck suddenly twitched.He was startled awake but the moment he woke up he had forgotten what he had dreamt about. He kneaded his neck and lifted his head. Through half-opened eyes, he looked around at his surroundings.It was pitch black.It wasn\u2019t the kind of darkness you get when you turn off the lights. Instead, it was complete and utter darkness like if one was blind.You Huo\u2019s eyes had been injured in the past so he was very sensitive to the difference between the two.Back when he was recuperating in the hospital, he had lived in this darkness for almost a year.One year. For someone who was both blind and missing his memories, it was a very long time.For a long time, he would fall into silence so that he wouldn\u2019t ask any stupid questions. He also spent most of his time in a lazy and drowsy state as he wiled his time away by sleeping. At all costs, he wanted to avoid feeling around like the blind\u2026\u2026..That was too weak. He didn\u2019t like it.Over time, it became a habit.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netThe doctors said that he was a little emotionally deficient. He didn\u2019t express his emotions much and he also possessed very little curiosity and doubt.He didn\u2019t take it seriously.It was just that he didn\u2019t meet the right people. If you brought over eight invigilators, his emotions would definitely not be deficient. As for invigilators like 001, just one would be enough.And now, he even felt a little doubt.When he was confined during the last exam, the room remained the same and nothing had changed.So why did he suddenly become blind after waking up from his nap?The most feared thing in his life\u2026\u2026.What silly algorithm did this confinement room use for it to think that he was afraid of being blind? If he was really afraid of that, why didn\u2019t the confinement room last time undergo any changes?You Huo sat in the darkness for a moment before sprawling back across the table expressionlessly.The confinement room was completely silent. Apart from him, there was no one else around.His light-brown eyes blinked silently in the dark a few times. He then buried his eyes in his elbow and soon fell back asleep..Back in the cabin, the minute hand on the clock moved a notch.For the invigilators, the three-hour confinement period passed in a blink of an eye.As soon as the bell rang, 078 leapt up from the sofa startled: \u201cLet\u2019s go. We should get\u2026.021?\u201dBefore he could finish speaking, he noticed that 021 wasn\u2019t anywhere on the second floor.\u201cThat\u2019s strange. She was clearly sitting on the carpet playing on her phone just now.\u201d 078 muttered with confusion.He guessed that Miss Decisive may have gone to the bathroom. He knew that with her personality, it was unlikely for her to be late, so he didn\u2019t think too much of it and went downstairs first.But when he reached the bottom floor, he saw 021 standing before the door to confinement room 1. She had just opened a small gap in the door.\u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d 078 said: \u201cI was wondering where you went. Didn\u2019t you say that we should wait for the bell?\u201d021 glanced at him and said: \u201cI just wanted to get some water and I saw that it was almost time. I didn\u2019t want to sit down and then stand up again.\u201d078 didn\u2019t doubt her words. He nodded and said: \u201cOh is that so? Okay then. You can call out this one, I\u2019ll get 001. I\u2019ll find you later.\u201d021 nodded. She then pushed open and entered You Huo\u2019s confinement room.078 saw her close the door behind her and internally thought: You\u2019re just calling him out so why all the effort closing and opening the door?But he only thought this. He naturally didn\u2019t dare say this to 021.That young lady may look good, but she has a bad temper.078 pushed open the door to the second confinement room. The scene of the ruin site was slowly fading. Because no conflicts happened, the room was clean and free from blood and flesh.And as for the detained Mr. 001, he was no longer reading the book. Instead, he was holding onto a black phone and fiddling with it.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026What are you doing?\u201d 078 approached with a frown.Qin Jiu welcomed him over: \u201cYou came just in time. I have something I want to ask.\u201d078: \u201cWhat is it?\u201dQin Jiu waved the phone and said: \u201cAn old device from a few years ago. It won\u2019t turn on. Do you know how to repair it?\u201d078: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWho are you asking to repair the phone? Care to say that again?Qin Jiu really repeated it: \u201cDo you?\u201d078 almost broke down: \u201cI don\u2019t. I really don\u2019t. Why did you suddenly pull out a phone in the confinement room?\u201dQin Jiu said: \u201cIt\u2019s a legacy my friend left with me. I wanted to see what\u2019s inside.\u201d078: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe said nothing in response to that. He gestured over to the door: \u201cPlease.\u201dIt had the same meaning as \u201cget out\u201d..Next door.021 stood before the table in the confinement room. Her fingers with dark red nail polish poked at You Huo\u2019s shoulder.The darkness around them was slowly fading and the lights from within the room gradually projected down.021 stood under the light and whispered: \u201cYou said it yourself. If you were ejected and the system still existed, I must bring you back and wake you\u2026..\u201d\u201cYou. Should. Wake. Up. Now. Mister. Invigilator.\u201d She poked him as she emphasised each word. Although her expression was no different from the usual, her tone was much livelier.After a long series of pokes, she waited for a while. You Huo who was almost impossible to wake up ruffled his hair and sat up.He squinted his eyes and looked up. His cold and beautiful face was even more dazzling under the light.When 021 was about to say something, several knocks came from the door behind them.\u201cDone yet? Let\u2019s go.\u201d 078 poked his head in.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe corner of 021\u2019s lips twitched. She pulled out her big sunglasses and put them on. Resisting the urge to twist off that head of his, she calmly raised her chin and said: \u201cWe\u2019re leaving now.\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Miss 021 knows somethinnnnggg!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The undercurrent beneath the sea was turbulent.The small white ship began to turn back.After coming out from the confinement room, 021 didn\u2019t try to talk to You Huo again.Everything was like how it was when they first boarded the ship.This Miss Decisive walked through the cabin wearing her big sunglasses paying no heed to the others. Whenever she had the opportunity, she would lash out at 078.078 didn\u2019t know what he did wrong.But given this lady\u2019s usual temper, he didn\u2019t think too much into it.There were only some very occasional moments when she would quietly look though her sunglasses at You Huo without anyone else noticing.She wanted to know whether You Huo heard what she said in the confinement room earlier.But judging from how he was acting, he appeared to have no reaction.He was there talking to 922\u2026\u2026.He was responsible for being \u201cthere\u201d.922 was responsible for \u201ctalking\u201d.\u201cOkay, okay, okay. There\u2019s no point looking at me. With such strong current, how can I get the ship to stop moving?\u201d 922 raised both his hands.\u201cIsn\u2019t this the invigilator\u2019s quarter?\u201d You Huo said.\u201cThe invigilators quarter must keep pace with the rest of the examination centre. If there are turbulence, there will be turbulence. We don\u2019t get special treatment.\u201d922 pointed next to the table: \u201cLook at 154. His face is almost the same colour as bile. If we had the ability to stabilise the ship would we have to wait until now to do that?\u201d154 supported himself using the table and stood up with a green, sickly face. Just as he wanted to open his mouth to placate them, his expression suddenly changed, and he turned around and ran off.\u201cPoor thing. Gone to throw up again. These seasickness plasters don\u2019t work at all.\u201d 922 said.The small white ship swayed too much. Regardless of whether they\u2019re invigilators or examines, none of their expressions were good.Only 922 who constantly cried \u201cseasick\u201d seemed to be fine. The ship swayed until the floors were practically like a seesaw, yet he remained stable like an old dog.But that old dog seemed to fear You Huo. Fearing that he would dig himself a grave if he explained too excessively, he subconsciously pushed Qin Jiu out: \u201cBoss, you know very well how dipilated this ship is. You\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAs soon as 922 turned his head, he saw Qin Jiu who is very familiar with the ship walk naturally into the kitchen.Please read this from kk translates922: \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhat are you doing\u2026\u2026..?In an instant, Qin Jiu reappeared. In his hand was a plate of fresh oranges.There was clearly a chair, but he didn\u2019t sit there. Instead, he had to sit on the armrest of the sofa You Huo was on, deliberately making him a whole lot taller.He changed into a relaxed posture and passed the plate over: \u201cRisked my life and got these from the kitchen. Seeing that we both got confined, how about I give you half?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dWhat damn fucking risking your life?\u201cNot eating.\u201d You Huo had lost his appetite from the swaying of the ship.Qin Jiu picked up a slice and said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard about this. Sailors during the middle ages are very susceptible to scurvy. I don\u2019t know about those in the cave, but it could possibly affect us if we stay here for a while. Those who have scurvy would have dark spots on their face and their teeth would become loose. If you accidentally knocked them, they could all fall out.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd then\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dQin Jiu wanted to continue but before he could do that, You Huo snatched three slices from his place.922: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dYou may be able to prevent other things, but it was impossible to stop his boss from pushing the limits.But what could he do? He could only let them eat.And that damned boss even teased the examinee: \u201cCongratulations, you have just escaped from the brink of death.\u201dThe examinee returned him with three slices of orange peel.922 couldn\u2019t watch it any longer.Since it was already like this, he had nothing else to lose. He went over and prepared to fry two more lamb chops.He didn\u2019t want to anger his boss and the god of misfortune. It would be better to make everyone happy, not to mention he also originally wanted to make something for his boss.Are there any rules prohibiting examinees from eating light meals at the invigilator\u2019s quarter?No.Afterall, when these rules were first made, no one would\u2019ve expected something like this.Thinking this, 922 busied himself in the kitchen..It took half an hour for the small white ship to return to shore.Before leaving, You Huo expressed his gratitude to 922 by asking if he had any extra food.922: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dA damned cafeteria wasn\u2019t enough for you and now you want takeaway?As soon as he was about to speak, the red light on his finger unsurprisingly lit up and it was accompanied by the \u201cbeep\u201d warning.\u201cLook, I received a warning.\u201d 922 showed him his finger: \u201cThe content of your exam is to keep those crew members alive, so it also includes providing them with enough food. If I let you get takeout, then that would be equivalent to me secretly helping you answer the question! In which exam have you seen invigilators help examinees with their answers?\u201dThese words hit the nail on the head.You Huo indeed had the intention to take some food back for the crew members.But since there was a warning, he didn\u2019t insist.He was okay with violating rules on his own accord but forcing others to violate them was too much.What\u2019s more, after these few exams he had a rather good impression of 922..The place where the small white ship docked at wasn\u2019t at the entrance to the stone cave. Instead, it was on the other side of the deserted island.The two familiarised themselves with the terrain before walking around the island along an indistinct road.According to Di Li\u2019s description of the question, this place should be part of the arctic circle.And therefore, it was completely different to ordinary deserted islands. Apart from the stone cave in the vicinity, all they could see was snow and ice.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netYou Huo and Qin Jiu trekked through the snow one after anothe. Their footsteps were accompanied by crunching sounds.This half of the island was extremely quiet. The sky was overcast, and in some areas you could faintly see a couple of stars. Even the sound of raging waves was obscured by the large reef which acted like a barrier.Qin Jiu looked up at the point where the sky met the sea and suddenly heard You Huo ask: \u201cIs the confinement room a special place?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Qin Jiu paused.His footsteps stopped. You Huo was a step ahead of him and his tall back silhouette melted into the night.Qin Jiu raised and eyebrow: \u201cWhy are you asking this?\u201d\u201cJust casually asking.\u201d You Huo\u2019s turned and glanced at him. He urged him with low voice: \u201cAre you coming or not?\u201dQin Jiu unhurriedly kept up with him: \u201cYou\u2019re trying to make me violate the rules. As a top student, you should be honest and well-behaved\u2014\u2014-\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026.Bullshit.\u201dQin Jiu laughed.\u201cAren\u2019t you demoted into an examinee? How could you be breaking the rules?\u201d You Huo glanced at his wrist.There was now a watch worn there covering the place where the rule violation warning light was. In any case, ever since Qin Jiu started taking the exam, that red light never turned on again.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to say a little more about the examinees.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cBut not the system. And even more so about things the system doesn\u2019t want us to mention.\u201dYou Huo\u2019s gaze wavered.Although that sentence of his didn\u2019t appear to mean much, it revealed some hidden messages.Those confinement rooms were indeed special. It had something to do with the system\u2019s settings, and the system didn\u2019t want to them to mention it.What could it not want to be mentioned?It could either be something confidential, or a bug.For a while, neither of them spoke. Only the sound of footsteps through the snow could be heard.Qin Jiu would always walk half a step behind. After a while, he spoke up with his low voice: \u201cI\u2019m very curious.\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t look up. As usual, he silently waited for the rest of his words, but the other party didn\u2019t say anything for a long time.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe stopped. He looked at Qin You with an exasperated look and forced out a single word: \u201cSpeak.\u201dQin Jiu then continued: \u201cDid you really see nothing in the confinement room?\u201dYou Huo naturally wouldn\u2019t tell anyone what he saw. Who knows whether the other party would think that he\u2019s afraid of the dark, especially someone like Qin Jiu\u2026\u2026So he just let out a \u201cmn\u201d and asked back: \u201cI heard you read a book for three hours in the confinement room and tried to repair a phone?\u201d\u201cWho did you hear that from?\u201d\u201c922.\u201dQin Jiu mentally noted that down: \u201cIt\u2019s not a book, it\u2019s a diary. Both the diary and phone are Zhao Wentu\u2019s.\u201dYou Huo stalled: \u201cZhao Wentu?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity you had already walked away when he rushed over.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cOtherwise you could see him in his sane state. At least he could remember his name. I guess it gave him that little bit of comfort.\u201d\u201cSo he does know you.\u201dQin Jiu looked at the horizon. The white mist from his breath blurred up the night scene: \u201cI was in his team when I was an examinee, but I didn\u2019t have any impression of it, so I tried to recall by looking through the diary.\u201dIt had been many years since Qin Jiu was an examinee. It was normal for him to no longer remember things from that time. Afterall, although he often smiled, he wasn\u2019t someone to form close relationships.\u201cRemembered anything?\u201d You Huo casually asked.\u201cMy memory of the events recorded in the diary wasn\u2019t deep, but I recalled some other things.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cFor example, invigilator A.\u201dYou Huo was still quite interested in this invigilator A. He waited to hear his next words.Qin Jiu fell silent for a moment. He then said: \u201cJust some unpleasant bits and pieces.\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: LOL these two managed to get a free meal too \ud83d\ude02Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He then dragged his words and described: \u201cIn order to anger someone, for example me, you would help speak for someone you don\u2019t know, for example invigilator A? Honestly, it\u2019s quite childish of you.\u201dYou Huo snorted. He pulled up his collar to cover his mouth and chin and walked on: \u201cMy mouth belongs to me.\u201dThe wind in the arctic at night was so cold, it could make facial paralysis turn into true paralysis. No one wanted to speak in this environment.The two walked on in silence for a while.Without anyone speaking, the island seemed a little too quiet. Just like how it was when they first came ashore, it seemed to be missing something.You Huo took a few more steps before coming to a sudden realisation.There were no sound of waves.They had experienced the turbulent waves on the small white ship, but it disappeared the moment they came ashore.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dSeeing him suddenly stopping, Qin Jiu was a little perplexedYou Huo said: \u201cThe sea is covered in ice. How did the invigilator\u2019s ship come in?\u201dIn the question, the reason why three Dutch merchant ships were anchored here, and the captain and crew were forced to live on this deserted island for eight months was because the sea was blocked by a thick layer of ice, preventing them from sailing out.That man with the buzzcut said that the merchant ships originally had ice breaking installations and would normally get through normal layers of ice without any trouble.But the ice here was too thick and too wide. All three ice breaking parts on the ships were rendered useless.The small white ship they were on earlier however was able to enter without a trouble and it\u2019s speed wasn\u2019t slow.He had actually overlooked something like this.\u201cThe invigilator\u2019s ship had some special ice breaking mechanism?\u201d You Huo asked Qin Jiu.As an invigilator, Qin Jiu was more than well-versed about matters associated with the examination centre and invigilators. He was practically like a one metre ninety reference book.The book said: \u201cWhy? You want to steal the equipment from the ship?\u201dYou Huo who was seen through didn\u2019t try to hide his intentions: \u201cI can\u2019t?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that you can\u2019t.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cIt\u2019s just that there aren\u2019t any. The invigilator\u2019s ship does not rely on any ice-breaking equipment to sail through. If it did, you would\u2019ve heard the sound of ice breaking along the way.\u201d\u201c922 said that invigilators ships do not receive any special treatment but in fact it does. It\u2019s ability to sail itself is a special treatment.\u201dQin Jiu said: \u201cWhen the invigilator\u2019s ship sails through, the ice around it would disappear and become normal seawater. It doesn\u2019t need any ice breaking equipment. Haven\u2019t you noticed? If it is something that allows invigilators to apprehend examinees more easily, the system would happily help out.\u201dThen maybe he could let the crew members pack up and sail out along the path the invigilators ship came in through?You Huo thought this as he walked towards the edge of the reef.Qin Jiu seemed to have the ability to read his thoughts. He turned around and shone his phones\u2019 flashlight at the place they were docked at earlier: \u201cDon\u2019t waste your energy. Look, as soon as the ship is gone, the ice is sealed up.\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesSure enough, when the light swept past the ice all looked flat. It was like it was never touched.\u2026\u2026Alright then.You Huo dispelled that thought of his.The people on the invigilator\u2019s ship had temporarily managed to escape..In the cave, everyone was busy.The wood from the two great masters that piled up as high as a mountain managed to solve the problem of not having enough burnable material in an instant.Everyone naturally wouldn\u2019t waste these resources which were obtained with much difficulty.They placed the wood in the driest spot possible and each took a tool and used it to cut them up into smaller pieces so that they would burn more easily.The crew members from the merchant ships possessed extensive survival experiences so the ones who were not injured helped the examinees set up the fire.It was necessary to ensure that the inside of the cave was sufficiently warm, but they also had to set it up so that smoke could be ventilated, and the fire pit wouldn\u2019t collapse.Several fires were set up. The inner and outer caves instantly became warmer and brighter.Frozen hair and clothes that were covered in filth were dried using the fire and the wounds on their skins looked better.Everyone\u2019s mood had improved significantly. They all sat around the fire to rest.Several seriously injured crew members, including the captain, were still in a lethargic state. Every half an hour, Wu Li would roughly check their wounds and body temperatures. Shu Xue worked hard as her assistant.It had to be said that her status as a pregnant woman made her look non-threatening and, with her gentle temperament, she was able to get close to the others very quickly.Even the extremely stoic Wu Li spoke to her more than anyone else.While they rested near the fire, Wu Li suddenly asked Shu Xue: \u201cDo the two friends of yours suffer from a mind illness?\u201dShu Xue: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThis extremely serious lady asked that very politely, but it sounded like she was cursing them out.Shu Xue could neither cry nor laugh: \u201cI haven\u2019t heard them mention it. Why do you say that?\u201dWu Li said: \u201cThey sometimes act like they do.\u201dShu Xue thought about it for a moment: \u201cIn fact, I haven\u2019t known them for long. We went through two exams together, so I only know them to a certain degree. Why don\u2019t you\u2026\u2026ask them?\u201dShe herself couldn\u2019t see any signs of illness in You Huo and Qin Jiu. She just felt that they were brave and strong and didn\u2019t appear to be sick. Besides\u2026\u2026\u2026.mind illnesses shouldn\u2019t be that common? How could both of them coincidentally have it at the same time?The probability of that happening was too low. Shu Xue felt that it wasn\u2019t likely.But she wasn\u2019t a professional herself. Wu Li certainly had her own reasons for her to say that. Shu Xue didn\u2019t want to overstep her boundaries and jump to conclusions for You Huo and Qin Jiu.Mm\u2026\u2026.What if there really was something and it was overlooked.Shu Xue thought this.Wu Li rubbed her hand to warm it up and said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see. Maybe it\u2019s just my occupational disease playing up and I was being overly sensitive.\u201d.When You Huo and Qin Jiu returned to the stone cave, everyone had already finished their part of the job and were taking turns resting.Some slept by the fire letting out small snores.Most didn\u2019t sleep very well. From time to time they would open their eyes and roll over.She Xue looked very sleepy. Sitting in the corner while holding onto the suitcase, her head would drop from time to time.You Huo and Qin Jiu lightened their footsteps and walked over.She patted herself awake and said: \u201cYou\u2019re finally back\u2026\u2026\u2026I calculated the time. It has been more than three hours, so I thought something happened. I wanted to go look for you but was stopped.\u201dThe man with the buzzcut shoved his pocket watch back and said rigidly: \u201cIt\u2019s not safe at night. I naturally won\u2019t let you take risks.\u201d\u201cNow that the last two are also back, go and seal up the hole.\u201d He called out to a crew member and they went outside together. Using the fire, they set up a few obstacles.\u201cHurry and rest up. Try to sleep as soon as possible so that you won\u2019t wake up if anything happens at night.\u201dHearing the words \u201cwon\u2019t wake up\u201d, Qin Jiu gave You Huo a meaningful look.You Huo sat in the cover and straightened out his legs: \u201cI\u2019ll keep watch.\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net\u201cDid you sleep your fill in the confinement room? If you haven\u2019t slept enough, I don\u2019t mind doing a little more work tonight. I\u2019m just worried that you\u2019ll fall asleep halfway. You sleep more deeply than I do.\u201d Qin Jiu said.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dUnder his piercing glare, Qin Jiu gestured an act of zipping up his mouth before covering himself up and closing his eyes..You Huo leaned back against the stone wall. His eyes quietly looked over the people in the cave before finally stopping somewhereThere, two men huddled together. They both trembled slightly, and their enlarged shadows reflected onto the walls also similarly shook.Their faces were like white paper. One of them was nervously biting his nail looking particularly anxious.You Huo recognised these two. One was called Chen Fei and the other was called Huang Rui. Their total score was only 11 points, which was a little more than 6 points less than You Huo and Qin Jiu\u2019s. They are currently ranked last.They had tried very hard. They searched everywhere for branches and even checked the merchant ships, but their harvest was too small to reverse their situation.If nothing went wrong, in a few hours at midnight, they would be the first group to take responsibility for the dead crew members and would be subjected to due punishment.Although they didn\u2019t know what the punishment was and why it was called bearing responsibility for their death, they knew it wasn\u2019t going to be anything good\u2026\u2026perhaps they would instantly lose their lives.Right now, they were just waiting for the guillotine to come down..The first officers\u2019 pocket watch slowly ticked on. It represented the examination time.At 23:57pm at night, a bell suddenly sounded inside the cave.The sleeping examinees were instantly startled awake. One even jumped up sporting their messy bed hair: \u201cExam time?\u201dThe one who jumped up was Di Li. He looked around blankly before rubbing his face and sitting back down: \u201cFuck\u2026\u2026Scared me to death. I thought I heard the bell for class and thought I was late for my university entrance examination.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your imagination.\u201d\u201cThere really was a bell. Scared me\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy is there suddenly a bell? I\u2019m most afraid of that sound.\u201dThe others murmured in confusion.Qin Jiu was rubbing the inner corners of his eyebrow. You Huo suddenly patted him.\u201cHm?\u201d He looked up.You Huo pointed at the stone wall and said: \u201cRecalculating points.\u201dAs soon as he said that, the voice of the dead rabbit rang through the cave. It carried a strange echo.\u30102 minutes and 21 seconds until midnight. Now recalculating today\u2019s score.\u3011\u3010Today, examinees could earn points from two areas.\u3011\u30101. Treating the crew members.\u3011\u30102. Finding fuel to ensure that temperature is maintained inside the cave.\u3011\u3010The scores are calculated as follows:\u3011\u3010A total of 6 points for treating the crew members, including 2 points for finding medicine and 4 points for diagnosis and treatment.\u3011\u3010A total of 8 points for finding fuel to ensure that temperature is maintained inside the cave, including 5 points for finding sufficient fuel, 1 point for chopping up the firewood, and 2 points for starting up the fires safely.\u3011On the stone wall, the scores for the examinees began to change.Because Qin Jiu and You Huo provided medicine and found fuel, they earned 7 points and jumped up from 17.25 to 24.45. In an instant, they became top four.Shu Xue and Wu Li earned 4 points for diagnosis and treatment, so they also jumped up in rank by two places.Although Di Li and the others also found some fuel, the quantity found was too far from \u201csufficient\u201d, so they only received 1 point.Most of the remaining groups also earned 2 points for chopping up the firewood and starting up the fire. It was better than nothing.Chen Fei and Huang Rui did their best and received a total of four points. Their total score changed from 11 to 15, but they were still in last place.They sat there paralysed. They were both shocked and terrified.At this moment, the dead rabbit spoke again.\u3010All points have now been allocated. Bonus points and penalties will now be applied.\u3011\u3010Today, examinees could be penalised for one area.\u3011\u30101. Violating examination rules and dismantling the system ship.\u3011\u3010The scores are calculated as follows:\u3011\u3010Dismantling of the system ship resulted in complete loss of function of the ship. As it can no longer be repaired, the nature of this violation is extremely serious. A total of 10 points were deducted for offending examinees.\u3011The scores on the stone wall once again began to change.You Huo and Qin Jiu\u2019s points were severely affected. From 24.25, it crashed to the ground and changed into 14.25.Thanks to the joint efforts of the two, they went in the opposite direction and fell into a pit. The total score for them today was -3, successfully kicking Chen Fei and Huang Rui away and taking over the throne in last place.The examinees were as silent as a mouse.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: What a rollercoaster\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He stared blankly at the two great masters.During the afternoon, everyone was saying that these two were their hope but within just a few hours, their hope was about to get themselves killed..With the attention of more than 30 examinees in the cave on them, You Huo squeezed out a whisper from the crevices between his lips: \u201cWhen did the retard learn to penalise points?\u201d\u201cYou called it a retard so it would naturally deduct points to save its face.\u201d Qin Jiu seemed to think that whispering to each other was amusing so he similarly suppressed his voice, \u201cSomething like this isn\u2019t unusual. Didn\u2019t you also get points penalised in the first exam?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cIt was only two points.\u201dFortunately, he had said that with a small voice. If the other examinees heard the word \u201conly\u201d, they would probably experience discomfort and feel faint.Afterall, the others worked themselves to the bones that afternoon to earn those three points. If their progress was called \u201cclimbing\u201d, the progress of those two were more like \u201cflying up and down\u201d.Qin Jiu said: \u201cThere is a difference in severity between illegible answers and dismantling a ship.\u201d\u201cIs it the hunter\u2019s death considered serious?\u201d You Huo said: \u201cYet no points were deducted, and bonus points were given instead.\u201dQin Jiu wanted to laugh.A degraded invigilator was still an invigilator.He looked at You Huo\u2019s calm side profile and waved his hand to signal for him to come closer: \u201cI think there is a need to explain something to this almost rebellious top student here.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026..Speak.\u201d\u201cHere, triggering the exam subject and triggering the system are of two completely different natures.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cOf course, it is better not to trigger both.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dYou Huo looked expressionlessly at him.As an invigilator who dared to trigger anything, he didn\u2019t know how he had the nerve to say something like that.Qin Jiu saw his expression and paused before adding: \u201cIn theory, both shouldn\u2019t be triggered but if you wanted to compare them, there is no doubt that the latter is more serious. It\u2019s not just an issue of one being more serious\u2026\u2026.You\u2019re in fact challenging its authority.\u201dHearing the word authority, You Huo murmured, \u201cAuthority.\u201dA system that would drag people into exams for no reason, a gadget that would casually decide one\u2019s life and death, actually had the nerve to mention authority?Please read this from kk translates\u201cDon\u2019t sneer at me.\u201d Qin Jiu casually pointed around: \u201cIt is everywhere in the exam centre. You can do that a few times to the scoreboard or towards any corner of the cave. You can even do it to the rabbit.\u201dDead rabbit: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cCurse it out a few times and get penalised 10 points?\u201d You Huo said: \u201cThat\u2019s okay. Not bad.\u201dDead rabbit: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t be that bad.\u201d Qin Jiu said with a grin: \u201cYou touched the crow\u2019s head in the last round, but did they penalise you? You can just curse it out as much as you want.\u201dDead rabbit: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dYou Huo glanced at Qin Jiu strangely: \u201cAre you speaking up for it?\u201dAfter he asked that, he felt that those words of his didn\u2019t sound right.As an invigilator and a part of the system, it was natural for Qin Jiu to speak up for the system.But his words\u2026\u2026.unknowingly placed Qin Jiu on the opposite side of the system; into his own faction.And yet he didn\u2019t even realise himself when this change first started\u2026\u2026..You Huo furrowed his brows slightly. He then said almost immediately afterwards: \u201cForget it. Take it as if I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cI heard it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dYou Huo\u2019s expression gradually turned expressionless.\u201cIf you are really curious about something, we can find an opportunity to discuss it another time. If we are invited back to the invigilator\u2019s quarter again, we at least will have some topics to talk about to pass the time.\u201d When Qin Jiu said that, he winked his right eye.You Huo was slightly stunned.In an instant, Qin Jiu continued: \u201cIn short, the system has its own set of rules. Challenging the system far exceeds challenging the exam subject in severity so you would only be punished for violating the rules for killing the hunter and no points were deducted. Dismantling the ship however is not the same. This is something the system cares a lot about.\u201dYou Huo looked at him for a moment. He then raised another objection: \u201cDestroying the examination centre is more serious than dismantling a ship but only five points were deducted in the last exam.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.Looks like this majesty is very forgetful. Let me remind you again.\u201d Qin Jiu pointed to himself: \u201cOnly five points were deducted because another person had to bear the rest of the responsibility. That person is talking to you right now.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cHonestly, I have always been waiting for a gift of gratitude, but it seems that a particular examinee has no awareness of this common courtesy?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s okay.\u201d Qin Jiu added: \u201cI have a lot of patience. I don\u2019t mind waiting a few more days.\u201dYou Huo\u2019s beautiful eyes finally moved a little. He thought for a few seconds before replying without hesitation: \u201cCoincidentally, I also don\u2019t mind.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d.Not far away, Di Li was utterly shocked: \u201cAre the two discussing about their fates? Why are they still smiling?\u201dHis teammate Brother Li carefully assessed their expressions and said: \u201cThe thing is, only one of them is smiling\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dDi Li: \u201c\u2026\u2026Is there a difference?\u201dBrother Li: \u201cNo.\u201dEveryone was worried about what was going to happen, but the two involved parties were calm and was even in the mood to chat.At this point, Di Li finally understood how the scores of those two came about.As someone who had undergone a number of exams, he was extremely sensitive to scores. On any normal days, it pained him a lot if he lost a single point but now, he felt pain all over when he looked at You Huo and Qin Jiu.He even impulsively had a thought: If the system allowed it, he could gift them two points. But he thought about it again and realised that no matter who he gave those points to, someone would always be ranked last.There would always be someone who couldn\u2019t escape the punishment.Seeing You Huo and Qin Jiu dive straight to last place, he felt uncomfortable.But would he feel better if they were replaced with Chen Fei and Huang Rui?Of course not.No matter which group it was; no matter who it was that was standing at death\u2019s door, he wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable.Afterall, the human heart was still soft.And this garbage system never did anything reasonable.Before everyone was able to return to their senses following the sudden changes in scores, a strong gust of wind suddenly started inside the cave.The first to notice were the merchant ship crew members.These NPC\u2019s who had suddenly become sleepy when the dead rabbit spoke was suddenly startled awake.The first officer with the buzzcut asked with confusion: \u201cWhere\u2019s the wind from? Was the fire at the entrance of the cave moved?\u201dHe asked the crew member near him.The crew member muttered: \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be. I\u2019ll take a look.\u201dThe first officer then asked the examinees: \u201cDid you feel it?\u201dAs he said that, there was another gust of wind. It was wet, and it carried the smell of the sea.Many examinees noticed it this time.They shuddered for a moment. A feeling of numbness crawled up to their scalp.The stone cave outside was near the entrance so it was normal for it to occasionally have some wind. They are however currently gathered inside the inner cave which could only be accessed after turning down a couple of bends, and there was also a fire barrier\u2026\u2026..How could the sea breeze reach where they were?And the wet water vapour in the air should also have dried up after passing through the fire!Everyone looked around trying to find the source of the wind. They became more and more afraid.Suddenly, someone screamed: \u201cWait, I hear something!\u201dEveryone stopped. They immediately froze in place: \u201cWhat sound?\u201d\u201cListen. Don\u2019t make any sounds and listen carefully!\u201dThat examinee\u2019s eyes were extremely wide, and his eyeballs spun around in panic. He looked suspiciously at every corner of the cave.He pressed his finger to his lips and maintained that position.Before his eyes could move around a few more times, he heard a huff. All the fires went out at the same time.The cave suddenly turned dark. They couldn\u2019t even see their own hands.Exclamations and screams sounded almost at the same time. In an instant, the cave was filled with panic.\u201cStop shouting.\u201d You Huo warned with a low voice.He pulled out a lighter from his pocket and flicked the lid open.Click.A thin, small flame lit up within the darkness. Although it was not as good as the fires, it was better than nothing.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netHe and the flame in his hand suddenly became the centre of attention. More than thirty examinees and the few crew members who were awake regarded him as the target and moved in closer together.The feeling of suffocation by humans was by no means a wonderful experience.With everyone huddling over, You Huo almost stepped onto Qin Jiu..The voice of the first officer with the buzzcut sounded: \u201cIt\u2019s here. It\u2019s here. Every time we encountered it, it would be like this\u2026\u2026.Somehow falling asleep, the fire suddenly going out and then a monster suddenly attacking.\u201dThose words of his scared the people present. Everyone stiffened up. No one dared to act rashly.In an instant, the stone cave became deadly silent.Then\u2026\u2026..a strange sound was heard.Squeaking. It was hard to describe.It sounded like something soft being pulled and rubbed\u2026\u2026It made those hearing it feel uncomfortable.Not only that, it was also accompanied with some kind of hollow dripping sound.It was probably the sound of water dropping from a large height.Splat\u2014\u2014\u2014Di Li suddenly felt something wet on his face. He reached out to touch it.Splat\u2014\u2014\u2014You Huo also felt something wet on him. He squinted his eyes in response to the spatters.He blinked a few times. Just as he was about to recover, he suddenly felt someone gently grab his wrist and lift the lighter up. The lighter was guided around above his head.Qin Jiu said: \u201cLook up.\u201dEveryone slowly looked up to find the source of the dripping water.On the cave ceiling was something they couldn\u2019t make out. Its skin was fleshy and pale, its body was spread everywhere like vines and it also sported two large, dark eyes.It quietly covered the entire ceiling of the inner cave. Twisting its greasy head, it quietly looked down at the people below before opening his blackhole-like mouth.Huff\u2014\u2014\u2014A wet wind carrying the scent of the sea blew through them.The lighter suddenly went out.This time, no one screamed.When faced with true fear, no one had the time or ability to scream.Only suffocating silence remained.Di Li felt his mind go blank.By the time he could make a sound, he noticed that something near him seemed to be missing.After another two seconds, he realised that You Huo who he was huddled against was gone.Not only You Huo\u2026\u2026He felt around blindly in the dark. Qin Jiu was also gone.Soon, more people noticed this.In an instant, discussions and cries of alarm sounded.\u201cWhere did they go?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re gone! They\u2019re really gone!\u201d\u201cYou Huo? He\u2019s called You Huo right? Qin Jiu?\u201dSomeone tried calling out their names in the dark.But there was no response.Just as everyone was busy making a fuss, the dead rabbit spoke up again.\u3010Unfortunately, a total of eight crew members died today. According to the examination rules, at midnight today the group ranked last would need to bear responsibility for the deaths. If the number is not enough to make up for the number of dead crew members, it will continue the next day, and so on.\u3011\u3010This deserted island does not exclusively belong to the crew taking refuge here. During the past eight months, all the prey and nearby fish entered the crew\u2019s stomach and the original resident of this island is not happy. It had starved for many days and had always been trying to fill its stomach, but it had never been able to do so until today\u2026\u2026.\u3011\u3010To it, today is a wonderful day. The dead crew members could fill its stomach, but the officer ordered for the bodies to be hidden, ruining its plans. But that\u2019s okay. These strangers here are just as delicious. Seeing them, it instantly felt an increase in appetite.\u3011\u3010And so, it took them away.\u3011The dead rabbit stopped for a moment. It then said in a rigid voice:\u3010After two hours, the remaining examinees can mourn for their companions. I wish you good luck.\u3011Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Taken away \ud83d\ude31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It didn\u2019t give them any chance to react.The crew members at least experienced the process of being taken away so they could struggle and fight against it but, for the examinees, the process of being \u201ctaken away\u201d was omitted and they were no longer inside the cave the moment they opened their eyes again.From the corner of his eyes, the environment had completely changed. As for what exactly changed, for the time being You Huo couldn\u2019t tell. Afterall, he was currently facing the monster\u2019s mouth\u2026\u2026.It was probably its mouth.In any case, it was a very big hole. Salty \u201csea breeze\u201d rushed over onto his face.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe was in the air. On his body was a large, pale, flesh-like thing lined with white holes that continued to squirm closer and closer intending to wrap around him completely.He was extremely disgusted.It turns out that, in order to punish people, the system was willing to do anything.The moment he was about to be completely wrapped up, You Huo heard Qin Jiu cursing out the system.\u201cTop student, li\u2014\u201dBefore he could finish, there was a click.The lid of the lighter in You Huo\u2019s hand flicked open. A small flame appeared.They were indeed wrapped by the monster\u2019s body because it was slippery and pale all around and there was fleshy softness under their feet\u2026\u2026but this was not the real mouth.The real mouth was just a few steps away. Lined with a circle of fine, sharp teeth, it exuded an extremely unpleasant smell.You Huo looked at Qin Jiu with a green face; \u201cThere are cigarettes in that pocket.\u201dHis upper arm was bound tightly. Although his elbow could move, he wasn\u2019t able to reach his jacket pocket from where his arm was so he could only try to turn sideways.The mouth opening was coming closer and closer.A hand reached into his pocket.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dAt this moment, this great master deeply regretted that suggestion of his.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netThe feeling of someone else\u2019s hand reaching into your own pocket felt too strange\u2026\u2026Fortunately, Qin Jiu moved fast.Before he could urge him to move faster, he had already retracted his hand.There was a sound of tearing\u2014\u2014The fine sound of paper tearing could be heard.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026You fucking still have the time to tear the packaging???\u201dThat mouth was almost closing up to his face.He rarely spoke with this tone. Hearing this, Qin Jiu actually laughed.But the sound of paper tearing also stopped.You Huo passed over the lighter. Qin Jiu grabbed a cigarette and sent it over\u2026\u2026That mouth lined with teeth widened a little. The fine blade-like teeth came into contact with his skin and he could feel the cold and wet sensation as well as its strong odour.Fuck.You Huo turned his face away and held his breath.\u2026\u2026\u2026The monster\u2019s fleshy white limbs were wrapped to form a ball. It covered the food that was just stuffed into its mouth and looked like an old-lady\u2019s toothless mouth.Time seemed to have stopped.Every second felt like a year.After about ten years, the toothless old lady began to emit smoke.It squirmed a few times and held it in.After another ten years\u2026\u2026\u2026.The old lady couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore.It was as if it had lung disease and it coughed furiously a few times\u2026\u2026.Eventually, it vomited..When he fell to the ground, You Huo subconsciously supported himself up.But when he pressed his hand down, he felt a bunch of strange things.It felt like a mound of various hard objects. When he supported himself up, those things broke apart and scattered.His palm was also cut by something sharp.But he paid it no heed.He fumbled around quickly to find somewhere to hide. After gesturing to Qin Jiu, the two fled and hid behind something.He flicked the lighter a few times before a flame finally appeared. It was however a lot fainter than before.You Huo lifted up the small flame and looked around. He saw that the thing they were hiding behind was a cabinet.The cabinet was rusty to the point that the lock and door had been fused together so it was impossible to open but you could still faintly see the markings on it.The markings looked very familiar. It was similar to the style on the first officer\u2019s pocket watch.They then saw wooden floors, cabinets and boxes that were half covered in green algae. Half the stairs had collapsed\u2026\u2026.and there was a round, dusty porthole before them.This was probably a ship that was abandoned a long time ago, but they still had no idea where the ship was located.You Huo looked around. There were two vertical stone pillars piercing through the ceiling and floor.From the look of these two stone pillars, they could guess that the ship may have encountered a large wave at one point causing it to overturn and then be lodged into these knife-like stones.On the ground next to the stone pillars were piles of yellow and white human bones.Many skulls sat amongst that pile, their empty eyes silently facing the two from various angles.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netThat was what they touched when they fell earlier.When You Huo looked out to look more closely, he supported himself with his right hand on the ground.There was a puddle of water under the metal cabinet. He just happened to press his palm onto it, and it was biting cold.The moment the chill rushed to the top of his head; he suddenly had a feeling of\u2026\u2026. familiarity.The skewed ship cabin, the sharp stone pillars, and also those pale human bones.Even the stuffy and suffocating smell. He felt like he had smelt that somewhere before.It was as if at some point in time, he had similarly looked out from the same place and saw the same scene.The water was colder than it was now and there was a monster throwing sticky filth around while exuding the smell of decay mixed with rust that was similar to the smell right now. At that time, it was probably even stronger\u2026..So strong, it made people vomit the moment they opened their mouth.He pursed his lips tightly together and blocked his nose with his knuckles. He didn\u2019t want to breath the air in.Someone then patted him on the shoulder and said: \u201cMister Invigilator, give me a cigarette.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201cWhat?\u201d You Huo suddenly returned to his senses and subconsciously looked back.Behind him, Qin Jiu was reaching out wiping his fingers across the porthole glass. His fingers left behind three finger streaks.He turned around and was confused: \u201cWhat what?\u201d\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d You Huo asked.\u201cMe?\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201dYou Huo frowned. He then quickly smoothened it out and restored his expression back to his usual expressionless look.\u201cWhy? You were too affected by this place, you started to hallucinate?\u201d Qin Jiu laughed.\u201cMn.\u201dYou Huo looked away. He once again tried to look out and examine the cabin.He changed his position. Just as he wanted to throw those words to the back of his mind, his finger came into contact with something.It was something short. It had fallen in the gap under the metal cabinet.You Huo frowned and picked it up. Using the flame from the lighter, he examined the object.After careful examination, he realised that it was a half-burnt cigarette.\u2026\u2026From a few days ago? Or about ten days ago?At the examinee\u2019s rest stop at the foot of the mountain, the sharp-tongued boss Chu Yue once mentioned that some examination centres were not cleaned well and that there may be traces left behind by someone from several years ago\u2026\u2026.Not far away, the monster who was forced to breathe a mouthful of smoke was behind the stone pillar. It was so enormous; you couldn\u2019t see its entirety.It quickly recovered and moved over to continue its attack.You Huo knew that he should be concentrating on this and looking for the right time to fight back\u2026\u2026..But somehow, he found himself lost in thought for a moment while he looked at the half-burnt cigarette that had already changed colour.He tried to recall the words earlier only to find that he could no longer remember it.He wasn\u2019t able to hear the contents clearly, nor distinguish that voice.He didn\u2019t know who had said those words but the moment it disappeared and the moment he saw that half-burnt cigarette, he suddenly found himself feeling\u2026\u2026.sad for no apparent reason.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: I can\u2019t wait till he remembers\u2026\u2026..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019re not moving.\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d You Huo shook his head.The flame from the lighter flickered before going out again.The cabin was dark. Only Qin Jiu\u2019s eyes faintly reflected some light.You Huo\u2019s fingers holding onto the cigarette moved slightly. A familiar feeling once again flashed by.He turned to stare at the monster.After a while, he suddenly uttered in the dark: \u201cDo you smoke?\u201dThis question was asked out of nowhere. Qin Jiu was stunned for a moment: \u201cNow?\u201dYou Huo then realised how ambiguous his question was: \u201cNo\u2026\u2026.\u201dThat feeling only flashed by for a moment and after it was gone, he suddenly felt a little empty.He had only met Qin Jiu a few times, but he never saw him buy cigarettes. What\u2019s more, it was too strange to pick someone out and ask them this. He recalled his question earlier and felt very stupid.\u201cForget it. Take it as if I didn\u2019t ask.\u201dYou Huo returned to his indifferent demeanour.Qin Jiu seemed to want to say something.But as soon as he opened his mouth to speak, he suddenly stopped himself. He tapped You Huo\u2019s shoulder twice as a reminder.Behind the stone pillar, the monster had finally recovered from its coughing fit.It began to move quietly.It seemed to carry a bit of fluorescence; or it may be because of its unusually pale white flesh, as it was more conspicuous in the dark.You Huo could clearly see its movements.Its large eyes looked out from behind the stone pillar before turning up, down, left and right. Its body that was large enough to fill the entire ship cabin heaved with each breath. Its multiple stretched out limbs tapped gently onto the wooden floorboards in accordance to the rhythm of its breathing.Tap, tap.This monster looked like a large mutant octopus. Its limbs were tentacles and there were even sucker pads lined on the inside.But it looked more grotesque than an octopus.You Huo held his breath in disgust.The tentacles of the ugly octopus were still outstretched. Its huge head looked out from behind the stone pillar and its eyes began to look around.Suddenly, one of its tentacles lashed out.Like a gecko\u2019s tongue stretching out to catch its prey, it lashed out in one direction.There was a boom.A stack of wooden boxes collapsed to the ground.The one that was hit directly by the tentacle was broken into small wooden pieces.Unfortunately, no one was there.The ugly octopus tilted its huge head to another direction and its eyes followed.It keenly used its senses.The cabin was silent. All that could be heard were the small squelching sounds it made as it moved.\u2026\u2026You Huo felt his shoulder being quietly poked a few times again.He turned around and saw Qin Jiu show his palm. On his palm was a mouldy cork.The other party gestured something.You Huo instantly understood.Qin Jiu\u2019s free hand pointed up his index finger:13The moment three fingers were up, You Huo threw out the half-burnt cigarette in his hand. At the same time, Qin Jiu threw the cork in the opposite direction.Whooooooshh\u2014\u2014\u2014-The tentacles followed at an extremely fast speed. They could even hear the wind whistling by.The body of the ugly octopus didn\u2019t move an inch. Only two of its tentacles went in both directions.Unsurprisingly, a wooden cabinet was hit causing it to fall over.As it fell, one side of it got stuck against the stone pillar.As for the other side, the mound of human bones was scattered around.Pelvic bones, skulls, leg bones\u2026.they were all scattered across the ground.Some also flew towards You Huo.You Huo and a skull stared back at each other.Many years ago, when it still had flesh and blood, it may have belonged to a captain or crew member of a previous fleet, or it may have belonged to an examinee who was dragged over to take the exam.You Huo\u2019s finger which reached out towards the skull paused for a moment. He then changed targets and grabbing a handful of nails and wooden chips.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netWithout saying anything, he started throwing them out one by one.Every time one was thrown, the ugly octopus would throw a tentacle out.One was thrown, and a tentacle followed.It didn\u2019t let any escape. It was clearly very excited\u2026\u2026How should he put it\u2026\u2026 You Huo suddenly understood why dog owners enjoyed throwing frisbees for their dogs to catch.It was the same on Qin Jiu\u2019s end.For a moment, a strange battle unfolded inside the cabin.His body didn\u2019t move, Qin Jiu\u2019s body also didn\u2019t move, and the ugly octopus similarly remained motionless.Only arms and tentacles flew around.It continued for a few minutes.The cabin was almost completely demolished. The tables, chairs and cabinets were all broken to pieces, but its two prey was still nowhere in sight.Ugly octopus: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe two great masters looked out. Seeing the chaotic scene before them, they expressed their satisfaction.They took a short break.The cabin suddenly went quiet. The ugly octopus\u2019s eyes started moving around again. The movements of its body began to slow down.It seemed to have calmed back down.It was as if it was playing a game with its food. It wasn\u2019t worried.Today\u2019s food was just a bit more mischevious.But that doesn\u2019t matter. It didn\u2019t mind playing hide and seek for a while before eating them.After exerting some energy, it would help increase its appetite and conversely make the food taste even more delicious.It thought generously.The more they resisted, the more delicious they would be.If they were frightened, the meat would become all soft and it wouldn\u2019t taste good.It even felt that eating them all in one go was too boring. It planned to eat one to fill up its stomach first before playing around with the other for a day and eating it afterwards.Whilst maintaining a certain level of hunger, every bite it takes would be even more satisfying.It wasn\u2019t afraid of its food escaping.In any case, no matter how much they tried to escape, at midnight the food would once again be delivered right to its front door.That fear, despair and also little bit of helplessness tasted exceptionally delicious.\u2026\u2026...You Huo didn\u2019t know that the ugly octopus was thinking this.He only saw its mouth open and close a few times before letting out a few droplets of drool.With the dim light entering from outside the porthole, it glistened.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs soon as the monster drooled, the smell inside the cabin became even more nauseating.You Huo held his breath for a moment\u2026\u2026..He finally couldn\u2019t stand it any longer.Without even looking back, he nudged Qin Jiu several times.He then used his fingers to quietly gesture a few numbers:13He hunched his back and rushed out.On the other side, Qin Jiu didn\u2019t disappoint him and similarly took action.The ugly octopus suddenly became excited. More than a dozen tentacles attacked them one after another.Wherever there were sounds, the tentacles would strike it.If one wasn\u2019t enough, it would send two.If two didn\u2019t manage to catch it, then it would send across a third tentacle.The cluttered and chaotic cabin was something the two had deliberately created. It placed them in a more advantageous position.While one passed through the stone pillar, the other had just jumped over the stairs.While one hid behind the metal cabinet, the other would rush through the gaps between toppled furniture.\u2026\u2026\u2026..Less than two minutes later, You Huo stood still behind a stone pillar.The tentacles of the ugly octopus were sharp and thin. In his hands, he held a bunch\u2026\u2026..Qin Jiu half squatted on the stairs. Next to him was another stone pillar and the rest of them were restrained under his feet.As for the ugly octopus\u2026\u2026\u2026Its tentacles were divided into two. They looped around everywhere inside the chaotic cabin with the ends of it caught by the two great masters.Its humungous head was lower than usual. With its tentacles in a split-like posture, it laid there slumped.You Huo asked Qin Jiu: \u201cDid you bring your rope?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate but I\u2019m not allowed to bring along any invigilator\u2019s items\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Qin Jiu\u2019s mouth may have uttered the word unfortunate, but his eyes swept across the room.He reached out and grabbed a rope from the corner of the staircase. After checking it, he said: \u201cI just saw this. It was probably used to tie the sails. Here.\u201dQin Jiu stretched his arm and threw the rope over.You Huo caught it and immediately tied the tentacles up like a ponytail.\u201cYou\u2019re really\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Qin Jiu said.Despite looking so cold and proud, you like to play with anything.You Huo threw away the tied ponytail and looked up at him. He waited expressionlessly for him to finish his bullshit.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netQin Jiu let out a sound before changing his words: \u201cFunny and humorous. Very interesting.\u201dAs he said that, he similarly searched around and found another rope. He bound together the tentacles below his feet.This time it was a double ponytail.Ugly octopus: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dQin Jiu supported himself with one hand and jumped off the stairs.The tentacles tied up by him was yanked down from the side of the staircase. It laid there like it was dead.Qin Jiu examined it and said: \u201cCan this thing be eaten?\u201dUgly octopus: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.No.\u201dQin Jiu was quite surprised: \u201cNo? But it looks no different to octopus tentacles.\u201dYou Huo glanced at him with disbelief.Qin Jiu thought he would say something like \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d but in the end the great master threw out a single sentence: \u201cIt\u2019s head is too ugly.\u201dUgly octopus: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dAs they spoke, the head of the ugly octopus grew rapidly in size.It accumulated a large amount of energy.It was then followed by several snapping sounds. The tentacles that were tied together suddenly broke off.Once the ugly octopus was no longer restrained, it immediately retracted the remnants of its tentacles.The large pale and fleshy body then quietly shrunk in size before disappearing through a crack in the wall.It disappeared in just a blink of an eye. All that were left were the two bundles of ponytails that it had voluntarily given up.Cutting off its tail to ensure survival?\u2026..Alright them.You Huo again flicked on his lighter. He walked over to the place where the ugly octopus disappeared.There were a few pieces of broken wooden boards there forming a hole less than one metre in diameter. Through the hole, you could see an uneven rocky reef surfaces as well as several deep crevices between them.The salty smell of the sea could be smelt through the crevices, and the sound of waves were faintly audible.After a while, Qin Jiu whistled softly beside the porthole.You Huo\u2019s attention was drawn over.\u201cRan off.\u201d Qin Jiu knocked on the glass window.Outside the porthole was the deep sea.On one side was the reef. The other side was the seawater beneath the ice.It appeared that this abandoned ship was still on the island. It was just stuck in a complicated position so they didn\u2019t notice it earlier.You Huo thought this and looked out through the porthole.In the sea not far away, the figure of something pale flashed by. It swam away without looking back.In an instant, the sea returned to its quiet and calm state.\u201cI don\u2019t smoke.\u201d Qin Jiu said suddenly.You Huo stopped for a moment before straightening himself up. He saw Qin Jiu leaning against the porthole watching him: \u201cWas this what you were asking earlier?\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t expect him to still remember that.Qin Jiu said: \u201cWhy did you ask that?\u201d\u201cNo reason.\u201d You Huo paused for a moment, \u201cPicked up a cigarette butt and was looking for the owner.\u201dQin Jiu remembered that mouldy thing and raised his eyebrows.You Huo had already left.The cabin was a mess.You Huo and Qin Jiu searched through the \u201cbattlefield\u201d and managed to find a lot of useful things inside the broken boxes and collapsed cabinets.This included candles, a lamp and a compass.There was even a medieval-style badge, a pocket watch and a rusted box.You Huo lit the lamp and finally gave the lighter a chance to rest.The two moved the compass dials and followed the direction of the wind inside the cabin to find the exit..Shortly afterwards.Inside the stone cave, the group of examinees exchanged information as they held up their fire torches.\u201cHave you found anything?\u201d\u201cWe went around and walked along the coast for half an hour, but we couldn\u2019t find any trace of that monster.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u2026there weren\u2019t any bones?\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u201d\u201cOh, oh, oh. That\u2019s good then. At least there\u2019s still hope that they may still be alive.\u201dAfter the disappearance of You Huo and Qin Jiu, they were quite scared.However, with the pregnant Shu Xue picking up a fire torch insisting on going out to look for them, how could they just sit around? They naturally formed teams and went out to search for them.But after searching for almost an hour, they couldn\u2019t find anything.Although they said that there was still hope if there were no corpses found, they were also fully aware of how slim that hope was\u2026..Everyone fell silent. They then let out a gloomy sigh.But before they could completely finish their sigh, two figures appeared at the entrance of the cave.When everyone looked back, they saw the two people they had thought had turned into bones carrying two bundles of tentacle, a metal box and a lantern\u2026\u2026They had returned with bags of goods.Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt this moment, one of the two great masters even glanced at the score wall. Standing before the dead rabbit, he muttered: \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t it considered violating the rules this time\u2026\u2026\u2026?\u201dDead rabbit: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dAre you fucking addicted to it???Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: HAHAHA Yep, definitely addictedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not only that, it would also whistle and make it sound like it was haunted.Those who are on the timider side would probably wet themselves.But at this moment, two tall figures squeezed out through the reef\u2014\u2014\u2014It was Di Li and his companion Brother Li.These two just happened to be a little OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder), and this trait of theirs was particularly obvious when they searched for someone\u2014\u2014\u2013They must ensure that they have walked through every single path at least once. If they missed any, they would feel uncomfortable all over.And so, they ended up in a damned place like this.In order to find them as soon as possible, they split up to search.Each went through a narrow gap and squeezed into the reef..Di Li just happened to be walking against the sea breeze. He squinted his eyes as he struggled on.As he walked, he suddenly heard strange noises behind him.At first, he thought it was the whistling sounds made by the wind but after taking a few more steps, he felt that something wasn\u2019t quite right.The whistling sound was indeed rather loud. It dragged on for a long time and it followed the rhythm of the wind but, in addition to that, there was also another sound\u2026\u2026.It sounded like\u2026\u2026.footsteps coming from behind.Echo?Di Li comforted himself.He deliberately lightened his footsteps. Supporting himself using the reef walls on both sides, he walked on slowly\u2026..But the footsteps from behind started to increase its pace.Di Li: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dCould it be Brother Li coming over?He again comforted himself.To verify this, he shouted out boldly: \u201cBROTHER LI\u2014\u2013\u201d\u201cAh, goddammit. You scared me!\u201d Brother Li\u2019s voice came from a gap diagonally ahead of him: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dDi Li: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe immediately stopped his footsteps and turned around.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netThe flame in the oil lamp he held flickered.There was no one behind him.\u2026\u2026\u2026...In the gap between the reefs nearby, Brother Li waited for a while, but he didn\u2019t receive any response.Di Li who had shouted his name earlier had suddenly stopped talking. It worried him a little.\u201cXiao Di\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201d Brother Li again raised his voice: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong\u2014\u2014-\u201dStill no answer.Only the sea breeze could be heard.Brother Li\u2019s heart fell. He supported himself with the reef wall and walked a few steps: \u201cXiao Di you\u2026\u2026.\u201dBefore he could finish speaking, there was finally movement from the other end.Di Li\u2019s passionate voice carried over with the wind: \u201cProsperity! Democracy! Civility! Harmony! Freedom! Equality! Justice! Rule of Law!\u201d(KKnotes: LOL here Di Li is reciting the core values of Chinese socialism.)Brother Li: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat the hell is this?He was so startled; he slipped and fell. He slid across the ice for about half a metre.He only managed to stop when his pant leg got caught onto something.Brother Li was both angry and amused. He quietly cursed: \u201cLittle brat playing around and scaring me\u2026..\u201dHe supported himself using the thing that stopped him from slipping and intended on standing back up.But the moment his hand came into contact with it, his scalp suddenly turned numb.This oil lamp that had falling to the ground rolled around a few times before the flame inside went out.But just that short moment was enough to see what he was holding\u2026\u2026..It was a hand.A frostbitten hand stuck out from under the ice and snow. Because it was so cold, it even stuck to the skin of his palm.Brother Li: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dSoon afterwards, two passionate voices could be heard coming from the reefs: \u201cPatriotism! Dedication! Integrity! Friendship!\u201d.Di Li and Brother Li rushed back to their nest.Before they had even entered the cave, they had already started shouting.\u201cWe found them! Hurry! Take a long a few more fire torches and we will also need a shovel or knife! We need to dig\u2014\u2014-\u201dBefore they could finish, the two rushed into the cave one after the other and came face to face with You Huo and Qin Jiu.Di Li: \u201c\u2026\u2026..The fuck?\u201d\u201cDig what grass?\u201d Qin Jiu\u2019s eyes moved back and forth between the two. (KKnotes: Di Li\u2019s curse earlier was \u64cd (Cao) and it also sounds like grass \u8349 (Cao) hence Qin Jiu\u2019s comment.)\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dDi Li was stunned for a moment.He stared at them with his already big eyes and said: \u201cYou\u2026\u2026.Weren\u2019t you\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe then pointed outside the cave and then looked at the completely fine You Huo and Qin Jiu. He finally realised how bit of an idiot he and Brother Li was.When he had touched that hand earlier, Brother Li didn\u2019t dare look at it too carefully.He just thought that the monster was a lot more efficient than he expected. It had only been an hour, yet the body was already hardened and buried under the ice.They had planned to rush back to get more manpower and tools to retrieve the bodies of their companions.But they didn\u2019t expect that they had already returned.Not only did they come back completely fine, they had also brought back a bunch of gifts.Di Li closed his mouth and was amazed.He patted off the ice and snow from his clothes and squatted near a fire.After warming himself up slightly, he suddenly wondered: \u201cSs\u2014\u2014\u2014-Since you two are back, then who\u2019s hand did Brother Li hold?\u201d\u201cWhat hand?\u201d You Huo asked.Di Li and Brother Li recounted their experience earlier.Qin Jiu raised his chin and indicated outside the cave: \u201cDid you forget? The crew members here have also buried people.\u201d\u201cOh yeah!\u201d Di Li knocked on his head: \u201cLook at this head of mine. As soon as its frozen by the sea breeze, my IQ immediately plummets.\u201dThe others also echoed: \u201cThat\u2019s right, the question also mentioned it before. The first officer would hide the bodies of the dead crew members.\u201dPerhaps it was because he was afraid of them being eaten by the monster, he had them buried under the ice allowing them to merge together into one. This way, it would be difficult for the monster to consume.But, wasn\u2019t the place where Di Li and the others went not that well-hidden? Afterall, they ended up holding hands only after tripping over.You Huo didn\u2019t quite understand the first officer\u2019s thoughts.But since this was after all a matter between the crew members, they had their own preferences. Perhaps they not only hid the bodies, they also took into consideration the ships customs..The items brought back by the two great masters aroused everyone\u2019s interest.The compass probably came from an examinee, and it appeared to still be functional.\u201cBut knowing north, south, east, west on an island like this is meaningless for now.\u201d An examinee sighed.\u201cWhy is it meaningless? Wasn\u2019t the final requirement of this exam to send the crew safely back on their journey?\u201d Classmate Di Li believed that there was a reason for its existence and he also had a little hamster disease where he would hoard everything that he felt might be useful, \u201cIf the compass is useless, are you going to rely on your finger to direct you home?\u201dAfter reprimanding the other person, he then felt that he went overboard so he added: \u201c\u2026\u2026..I\u2019m not trying to argue with you.\u201dThe examinee: \u201cI meant temporarily. It is meaningless for now. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to set sail tomorrow.\u201dNo one refuted.He wasn\u2019t wrong. There are still more than ten days until the ice melted so they would still need to stay here for a while.Thinking this, everyone\u2019s mood turned for the worse.But they quickly became excited again. It was because of the pair of ponytails.They were both scared and curious. Staring at the two bundles, they asked: \u201cThis\u2026\u2026.why did you bring something like this back?\u201dDi Li wasn\u2019t lacking in his gaming experience. He commented: \u201cThe tentacles of the boss. For clearance? For medicine?\u201dQin Jiu rummaged through the pile of wood. He picked up two pointed wooden sticks and said dully: \u201cFor seafood.\u201d\u201c?????\u201dEveryone retreated.They still vividly remember the monster hiding above the stone cave staring down at them just an hour ago.Who are you trying to scare?!This reaction of theirs wasn\u2019t unexpected. Qin Jiu didn\u2019t even move his eyebrows.He bored a wooden stick through each of the two bundles and then smoothly set up a stand above a fire pit before beginning to roast it.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netThe tip of the flames occasionally licked the surface of the tentacles.Gradually, the cave was filled with faint sounds of roasting. Just the sound alone was very enticing\u2026..The will of the people there were being tested..You Huo had already had a light meal at the invigilator\u2019s quarter so he was not very hungry.Besides, he had also brought along canned beef and instant noodles this time. Although it couldn\u2019t be compared to 922\u2019s cooking, it was still edible.So, when Qin Jiu started roasting the tentacles above the fire, he was completely unmoved.Rather than roasted tentacles, he was more interested in knowing how far he had to go to make the system deem something as rule violation.Sizzling sound entered You Huo\u2019s ears.He looked over at Qin Jiu with a frown. He then walked from the inner cave to the outer one and looked at the score wall with his hands in his pockets.Theoretically, that ugly thing was something the system sent over to punish them so it could probably be considered to be part of the system.As part of the system was cut up and roasted by them, no, by that person, can the system tolerate it?Judging from the earlier incident, it\u2019s probably\u2026\u2026.given up.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe noticed that the score wall wasn\u2019t far enough. At the very least, he could still see Qin Jiu from the corner of his eyes.After a moment of silence, he moved out of the cave.From this place, that bastard invigilator doing ridiculous things could no longer be seen. Not even his hair was visible.The sea breeze outside rushed past, slapping his face in the process.The others wouldn\u2019t stand out here for no reason, particularly at night, so there was only You Huo and the frozen dead rabbit by his feet.He squatted down and looked down at the rabbit.The rabbit looked back at him in silence.Qin Jiu had mentioned that, in fact, the system was everywhere. It wasn\u2019t just using things like birds and rabbits to watch and listen.So where could those so-called eyes and ears be? What kind of appearance would it take\u2026\u2026\u2026..He could smell the scent of roasted octopus.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d.Qin Jiu sat on one side of the fire with one leg bent. He slowly turned the wooden sticks one after another.The tentacles had curled up with the heat and it had also changed colour. In some areas, it had a shiny oil sheen and other areas had turned golden brown. The aroma of roasted tentacles was too strong. Very quickly, it filled up the entire cave, breaking down the will of most examinees.Firstly, it was because they\u2019re really hungry\u2026\u2026..And secondly, if they ignored that monster\u2019s face, these things here are octopus tentacles!Examinees came over one after another.Then came the ship crew.And last, the captain who was drifting in and out of consciousness also came over\u2026\u2026..It turns out that even if your stomach shrank after starving for so long, it didn\u2019t prevent people from experiencing the \u201cjoy\u201d of being full.The atmosphere inside the cave was both joyful and relaxed..You Huo avoided the sight of that ugly food and squatted at the entrance of the cave for half an hour.Just as he was about to stand back up, the dead rabbit which had been silent until now suddenly spoke up:\u3010After so many days, the crew members finally managed to have a filling meal. Bonus reward conditions have been met.\u3011\u3010The melting of the glaciers that was initially set to be in 15 days have been pushed forward to 2 days later. All examinees should make the most of this opportunity to return the crew members back on their journey.\u3011\u3010Note: The melting of the glaciers will only happen once. It will be at your own risk if you missed it.\u3011\u3010In addition, the involved team will receive an additional 6 points.\u3011On the score wall, Qin Jiu and You Huo\u2019s points floundered again. It rose from 14.25 points to 20.25.Chen Fei and Huang Rui returned to the bottom.The two of them were shocked stiff.You Huo stared at the rabbit with a frown.But it once again fell silent after making that report. It no longer made a noise.This was far from his expectations\u2026..A shadow fell over him. Qin Jiu walked over: \u201cAre my roasting skills that bad for you to prefer squatting out here for 32 minutes instead of staying inside?\u201d\u201cOr are you more interested in roasted rabbits than roasted octopus?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dHow much better could a dead rabbit be compared to a fake octopus?Qin Jiu suddenly stretched his hand out: \u201cCan you stand? I can reluctantly lend you a hand.\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t get up. He looked at Qin Jiu\u2019s dry palm and suddenly asked: \u201cWould it count violating the rules if we really roasted it?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWould it count? Mr. 001 didn\u2019t know but he didn\u2019t mind giving it a try..Five minutes later, the small white invigilators ship received two new rule violation notices.Familiar names, familiar people.922: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d078: \u201c\u2026\u2026Is it too late to apply to be reassigned?\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: They actually roasted the rabbit!! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Also, for your information they have moved the melting period ahead so it\u2019s not 15 days, it\u2019s 2 days.\u201d\u201cOh yeah! How could I forget this?

Two days would be four half days so they could come back eight times\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d 078 calculated this and fell into despair: \u201cI really don\u2019t understand what the hell they\u2019re thinking.\u201d922 was also in despair: \u201cThey\u2019ve probably digested their dinner and is coming back for supper.\u201d154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d078 sat paralysed in his chair: \u201c\u2026\u2026.I used to think that being an invigilator was easy and that it should be the examinees who should be afraid of violating to the rules. If anyone accidentally violated the rules, the other examinees would tread around carefully to avoid another case.\u201d922 missed those times: \u201cYeah\u2026\u2026..\u201dBefore encountering You Huo, their days as an invigilator were also like this.\u201cI have also worked with other teams often. A four-member team should logically be easier\u2026\u2026.\u201d 078 said.\u201cYeah.\u201d 922 echoed.\u201cWhich blind guy made me join your team?\u201d 078 then said.\u201cYeah.\u201d 922 again echoed.021 slammed the cup in her hand onto the table.078: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAh, he almost forgot. The blind person who picked this team was 021. Was this young lady someone he could anger?Of course not.078 said without hesitation: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dOutside the porthole, the night was deep.Looking into the distance, the sea was frozen for thousands of miles. There was only turbulent water around the small white ship.Please read this from kk translatesOnce it set sail, the ship again began to sway. 154 felt faintly nauseous. He leaned back against the chair to recover slightly.922 went upstairs to find him some seasickness patches. 078 on the other hand went downstairs to prepare the confinement rooms.021 picked up her sunglasses from the table and proceeded to clean them.The lying corpse 154 suddenly spoke up: \u201cAre you sure you want to wear sunglasses in the middle of the night Miss? Be careful or you might fall into the sea.\u201d021\u2019s movements stopped. She glanced across the table at him.154 was still leaning back. His eyes were not open, and his face was furrowed with discomfort.021 said with annoyance: \u201cAm I stupid?\u201dIf she wore it during dusk, she could say that it was used to block the sea breeze. In any case, she had always been acting coquettish, so no one would suspect anything she did.If she wore it at night, even if the other party\u2019s IQ was like those of 078\u2019s, they would notice that something wasn\u2019t right.She was originally just planning on cleaning the lenses before putting it away.But this 154\u2026\u2026seems to be quite sensitive?Without turning her beautiful eyes, she carefully assessed the seemingly proper looking colleague of hers. 154 then stood up.He glanced at Miss Decisive. Just as he was about to say something, he suddenly retched, covered his mouth and rushed to the bathroom.021: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dDo I look so vomit inducing?.Before long, the small white ship was moored on the coast.Four invigilators stood in a row at the bow, the rough sea breeze slapping them in their faces.078 was a very pompous person. He dug out two notes and officially read out the notice of violation: \u201cNot long ago, we received a notice that the two of you roasted the rabbit used for broadcasting announcements\u2026\u2026\u201dHe paused. He couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cWere you really that hungry?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t eat. Just roasted it for fun.\u201d Qin Jiu stood below the ship and laughed very contemptibly: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to read the notice, just throw the rope ladder down. You\u2019ll also be able to go back to the cabin earlier. Does it feel nice standing out here in the wind?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dYou actually have the nerve to say that?078 internally complained: If it wasn\u2019t for you who violated the rules, would we have to come out here to enjoy this damned wind?But those words of complaint were only uttered in his heart. Afterall, the other party was 001.To some extent, this person was someone who existed in \u201crumours\u201d and \u201clegends\u201d. In any case, he shouldn\u2019t mess with him.021 stood by the side of the ship. She used the tip of her shoe to pick up the rope ladder and throw it down.You Hu and Qin Jiu climbed up the rope ladder one after another.She wasn\u2019t wearing her sunglasses at this moment, so she did her best maintaining her expression.But the moment You Huo crossed the ship\u2019s rail, her eyes lit up.Unfortunately,\u2026\u2026the other party didn\u2019t appear to have noticed this change and just walked past her. He then headed straight into the ships cabin without any hesitation.021 internally thought: Sure enough, he probably didn\u2019t hear a single thing she said last time.Although she had expected this, she was still a little disappointed.Whenever this young lady was in a good mood, it wouldn\u2019t be shown on her face but if she was in a bad mood, it was very obvious.It made her other three colleagues fearful.As they brought the two gods of misfortune down to the bottom floor, 078 quietly asked 021: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we\u2026\u2026swap? Last time I was responsible for 001 and to be honest it was really awkward. This time, can\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs soon as he raised his eyes, he was met with 021\u2019s cold gaze.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d 078 shut his mouth and thought for a moment. He then whispered: \u201cOkay, okay. Take it as if I didn\u2019t ask. I know you\u2019re not a fan of that person. Here, you first.\u201dAs he said that, he moved aside and made way for the door to the first confinement room..You Huo walked into the confinement room.Before the door was closed, the room was the same as usual. It didn\u2019t turn black.Inside the room was a table, chair and a large mirror hanging on the wall.Instead of pulling out the chair to sleep this time, he walked around a few times before stopping before the mirror.Please read this from kk translatesThe mirror reflected the scene by the door.078 sent over his greetings before walking across to the second confinement room. Qin Jiu followed behind him. As he walked past, he raised his eyes and it met with You Huo\u2019s through the mirror.He gently winked, before brushing past 021\u2019s shoulder and walking on.021 then entered the confinement room and closed the door behind her..The room was silent.In the mirror, the cold Miss Decisive leaned against the door panel and brushed her hair behind her ear.She took a deep breath and was about to speak.You Huo said: \u201cWhat you said last time, I heard it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe breath Miss Decisive took was stuck in her throat. She had forgotten to exhale.You Huo turned around and quietly looked at herThis something completely unexpected.Along the way here, 021 had been thinking about how she should start speaking and what she should do to clarify everything in a short amount of time. Even if it wasn\u2019t everything, at the very least she should pass on the important information.She had planned it all out but with You Huo\u2019s sudden words, she suddenly\u2026\u2026.didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201cSit down and speak?\u201dYou Huo pulled out the chair. He then turned it around and placed it in front of her.021 was shocked by this act of his. She finally returned to her senses.She quickly waved her hand and said: \u201cNo need, we don\u2019t have much time. The confinement room would take effect about one or two minutes after the examinee enters. If I stay here until then, I would be the one crying.\u201dAfter she said that, she finally remembered her planned speech. She spilled it out like a machine gun: \u201cYou once said that if you were ejected, the first thing the system would do is to clear your memories of those years. Looks like it really happened. I know you have a lot of questions, but please don\u2019t ask anything yet. Listen to me first.\u201d\u201cI know you\u2019re curious about this examination system, but I can only make a long story short.\u201d\u201cThis system was created many years ago. The original plan was to apply it in the military and the like. Its role is for screening special recruits. Each exam is highly comprehensive and difficult because it aims to test all skills and aptitudes of the candidate. Those who are selected are regarded as highly dangerous individuals. Like a double-edged knife, if not handled properly, it could potentially harm yourself.\u201d\u201cAt first, for the sake of fairness and safety, a group of trainers were selected to monitor the test subjects. Of course, to ensure that they can suppress those examinees, the trainers are all elites and mostly from domestic and foreign military forces. In order to accommodate the situation, these trainers were later renamed invigilators.\u201d\u201cYou entered the system before me and was earlier than any other invigilators on board this ship. You were one of the first batch of invigilators and was the leader of an entire invigilator team. Your rank was A.\u201d\u201cLater, there were some problems with the system\u2026\u2026..You can tell without me pointing it out. The examinees being pulled into the system got more and more strange. The elderly, the pregnant, all kinds of people were dragged in. Even now, I still haven\u2019t figured out what basis the system used for this. In any case, it\u2019s a bit out of control.\u201d\u201cI participated in the examination very early. At that time, the system had not yet become like this. We were from the same school so you can be considered my senior. Of course, you don\u2019t know me, and you probably have no memory of my code number in your remaining memory. Anyway, you were the invigilator for several of my exams and over time with my one-sided efforts, we got a little more familiar.\u201d\u201cWhen I became an invigilator, the system had already started to act strange, but I couldn\u2019t get away. The systems control and monitoring of its invigilators was even more strict than those of examinees because we have become a part of it.\u201d\u201cThe invigilator teams had already been decided early on. After a reserve period, I should have originally entered your team but before I could enter, you encountered an accident.\u201d\u201cEverything related to that accident was completely wiped out by the system. It was difficult finding any relevant clues. At that time, I had only just transitioned from a reserve invigilator to an official invigilator, so I wasn\u2019t directly involved but I knew that you wanted to destroy it.\u201d\u201cYou tried to destroy it, but the chance of success was slim, so you left me with a message. You said that the system would likely eject you out and if the system still existed and you were gone, I was to pull you back in and reawaken you.\u201d\u201cActually, I was quite surprised you chose to leave me with that message. My abilities were limited so it took some time.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026..fortunately, I came.\u201dAs the lights in the confinement room began to dim, 021 spoke faster and faster.Except for the last sentence.After that, the confinement room once again fell into silence.You Huo sat on the edge of the table. His eyes looked in the distance at an empty spot and he appeared to be lost in thought.He had always been like this. Whenever he was silent, he would appear cold and aloof. Anger and sorrow could never be seen from his expression alone. It made it difficult for others to tell what he was thinking.After a moment, he looked up at 021 and said: \u201cThank you.\u201dIn that moment, 021 felt a little emotional.She took a deep breath and finally smiled for the first time.\u201cThen\u2026\u2026.after saying so much earlier, did you feel a bit of familiarity? Or did you remember anything?\u201d\u201cNothing for now.\u201d021 was disappointed, but she immediately livened up again: \u201cThat\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll remember eventually.\u201dYou Huo nodded.The confinement room got darker and darker. 021 said: \u201cI have to leave now. I know you still have a lot of questions; I\u2019ll try to create opportunities to find you in the future. Please cooperate.\u201dAfter saying this, she then remembered how this great master usually operated and hastily added: \u201cJust cooperate a little. You don\u2019t need to do much.\u201dWhen she grabbed the doorknob, You Huo suddenly said: \u201cThat\u2019s right, I have a question. And also I need your help.\u201d021 turned: \u201cWhat question?\u201dYou Huo said: \u201cWhen I was an invigilator, what was my relationship like with that person next door?\u201d021: \u201cMm\u2026\u2026\u201dYou Huo: \u201cMm what?\u201d021: \u201cDon\u2019t even mention the person next door. Just mentioning it ruins my mood. Your relationship was very bad. It is said that the accident that happened was mainly because of him.\u201dAfter she said that, she then asked You Huo: \u201cLet\u2019s skip this topic, lest you remember something bad instead. You said you needed help with something, what is it?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cCan examinees be confined together? Help me be confined next door.\u201d021: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dFuck this.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: And we finally learn a little more about this examination system.

What was even more coincidental was that they were each other\u2019s\u2019 nightmares. Does this sound familiar?\u201dYou Huo said: \u201cContinue.\u201d021: \u201cIn short, what A was most afraid of seeing was B, and what B was most afraid of seeing was A. It was something like that. With the two placed in the same confinement room, what do you think happened?\u201dThe young lady not only rambled, she even gestured with her body.It was a pity her audience didn\u2019t buy it.Fortunately, she was used to the other person\u2019s cold and aloof demeanour. Without waiting for You Huo to speak, she revealed the answer to the mystery: \u201cIn a single confined room, there were two A\u2019s and two B\u2019s.\u201d\u201cOne was the true person themselves, while the other was an image created from the other party\u2019s fear.

Four pairs of eyes looking at each other\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d021 paused appropriately to create a feeling of trepidation: \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about how horrible that could be. What about the confinement room?\u201dEven if the invigilators don\u2019t go crazy, the system would go crazy.After listening to her, You Huo nodded: \u201cSo it is possible, it\u2019s just that the most feared scenes of both parties would converge?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d021 internally felt that her efforts were wasted. All that talking she did wasn\u2019t to let him come to this conclusion!If he was 078, his head would have already been twisted off.But the other party was You Huo. She could only take a deep breath and keep smiling.\u201cIt won\u2019t necessarily converge.\u201d 021 explained: \u201cThey can also cover up. If one person\u2019s fear is significantly stronger than the other, it would cover up the other. Or, there is a possibility of the two scenes combining to form a new scenario. That would be the worst.\u201dShe wanted to say a few more in hopes of getting You Huo to give up.But this great master just nodded and said: \u201cYou guys have done this more than once?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dDamn you.Miss 021 even had the urge to kill.Except for the culprit You Huo, she would kill whoever appeared before her next.Just as she thought this, someone really came over to give up their life.Someone knocked on closed door to the first confinement room. When 021 opened the door, she saw the punching bag 078 standing outside.He looked a little surprised: \u201cYou haven\u2019t left yet?\u201d021 simply: \u201cLeaving now.\u201d078: \u201cWhy so long?\u201d\u201cJust checking to see if the confinement room is malfunctioning or if this tender looking examinee really has no fears.\u201d 021 said.This young lady\u2019s expression was cold to the extreme. Her hand behind her back however waved furiously at You Huo.078 had long grown used to this young lady\u2019s manner of speech and answered normally: \u201cIt\u2019s good that you haven\u2019t left yet, you saved me having to go upstairs. 001 just joked around with me but that reminded me of something.\u201d021 looked at him suspiciously. She had a bad feeling.Please read this from kk translates\u201cHow about this? Let\u2019s confine them together. In any case, it\u2019s boring for them staying in here alone and the purpose of punishing them isn\u2019t achieved. Confining them together might increase the effect.\u201d 078 said, \u201cWasn\u2019t it covered in the rules? If there are problems with the confinement room or if it cannot meet the needs, other appropriate measures can be put in place including merging the rooms.\u201d021: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dIn fact, they had done something like this before, so it wasn\u2019t something they had not done before. 078 however always liked to pull out all sorts of reasons to support his case when proposing something to 021 to make his words seem more convincing.Look, didn\u2019t he shock 021 just now?Uh\u2026\u2026perhaps he went a little overboard.078 internally thought this.A few seconds later, Miss Decisive wore a \u201cI\u2019m going to break the legs of this colleague of mine\u201d expression as she brought You Huo into the second confinement room.\u201cIn any case, be careful.\u201d She mouthed these words to You Huo with her back facing the door.When she was done, she changed her expression and went out to look for 078 to deal with..Inside confinement room 2, the scene of the ruin site was already beginning to appear.The sky was still extremely high, the air was cold and the forest in the distance was still as quiet as before.It wasn\u2019t very different from last time but there were also some slight changes.For example, those stacked metal pipes.Last time, there weren\u2019t much rust on the surfaces of the metal pipes. It could be considered the newest and cleanest thing in this ruin site.But this time, there were three additional red marks on them.Qin Jiu bent down before the metal pipe and reached out to touch it.Unsurprisingly, it was dried blood.It was not only on the metal pipes, there were also similar marks on the ground below his feet\u2026\u2026..Qin Jiu gently rubbed his fingers.After one confinement session, his memory of this place appeared to have become even more clearer.He didn\u2019t notice this change himself until it was once again recreated inside this confinement room. Because the scene here is created from his memories, some details that weren\u2019t there last time were now present..Qin Jiu stared at the bloodstains for a moment. He then sat down on the same metal pipe as the one in his memory.Once in this position, those three bloodstains matched with him.It was as if his fingers which were stained with blood was wiped on the tube. As for those on the ground\u2026\u2026..it seemed to have come from the blood on his chest.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026While he was lost in thoughts, startled birds flew out from the forest in the distance.The sky then gradually grew dark.He pulled out Zhao Wentu\u2019s phone from his coat pocket, but his eyes were still looking at the sky.There, the sky was clear. There were no clouds or signs of a storm, but the sky was steadily darkening.It was as if the stopped time was suddenly sped up. From early morning to dusk and then to nightfall, the entire process only took ten seconds.But he soon realised something.It wasn\u2019t the time that was changing, but that another person had entered this place causing everything to gradually darken.Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t completely dark. It stopped just before late evening..Footsteps could be heard in the distance. The light rustling sounds didn\u2019t break the silence of the ruins.Qin Jiu looked over in the direction of the sound\u2026..There, there was an opening by the base of the wall. The metal protective fences in that place was broken and twisted such that it formed a broken entranceway. A large mound of broken machinery and scrap metal blocked a part of that opening.You Huo walked out from behind that pile of machinery. Against the dark night, his tall figure was a little indistinct.He raised his hand to hold up the twisted fence before bending over and passing through the opening. When he raised his eyes, it met with Qin Jiu\u2019s.He unhurriedly approached him and stopped short before the pile of metal pipes.This scene was extremely similar to that scene in his memory\u2026\u2026..Despite knowing that both the time and person wasn\u2019t right, for a moment Qin Jiu was in daze.In the end, You Huo broke the silence after looking around: \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of being alone in the countryside?\u201dQin Jiu instantly returned to his senses: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s true, it really did look similar.He let out a low laugh and didn\u2019t refute. Instead, he similarly looked around and asked You Huo: \u201cWhat about you? Afraid of the dark?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dQin Jiu stretched out his long legs and patted the metal pipe to indicate for You Huo to sit down.Just as You Huo was about to bend over, he saw the bloodstains.At that moment, a feeling of extreme rejection suddenly surged inside him. It was clearly something that had already dried up but for some reason it bothered him a lot.\u201cIt\u2019s yours?\u201d He suddenly asked.\u201cNo.\u201dQin Jiu answered very quickly. It was almost done without a thought.After saying this, he froze. Internally, he could neither cry nor laugh.Those blood stains were indeed his, but it was something from many years ago. It was not a big deal admitting to it, so he didn\u2019t understand why he denied it so quickly.But since he had already denied it, he continued: \u201cIt was there when I came. I don\u2019t know who left it.\u201dYou Huo stared at those stains for a moment. That feeling of rejection lingered for a long time.He straightened himself up, turned around and found a scrap machine to sit on.The overwhelming coverage of one\u2019s fears by another\u2019s fears mentioned by 021 didn\u2019t occur, nor were there any increase in effect as anticipated by 078.There weren\u2019t two of him here, nor two of Qin Jiu.Please read this from kk translatesIt was just a ruin site half covered in darkness\u2026\u2026\u2026The scenes of the two of them had actually merged together without a problem. Everything was extremely calm.\u201cThat phone is Zhao Wentu\u2019s?\u201d You Huo\u2019s eyes fell onto Qin Jiu\u2019s hand.\u201cMn. He left it with me last time, but it had not been used for a while so for now I can\u2019t turn it on.\u201d Qin Jiu said.You Huo said: \u201cYou seem to have fiddled with it for a while. Any progress?\u201dQin Jiu said: \u201cMuch better than last time. I can at least get past the booting up screen.\u201d Qin Jiu said.\u201cAnd then?\u201d\u201cAnd then? It automatically shuts back down.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dYou Huo watched him fiddle with it for a while before asking: \u201cWhy did you call me over?\u201dQin Jiu said: \u201cI called you over? When?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026Then did your eyes cramp up?\u201dQin Jiu oh\u2019ed and pretended to just remember: \u201cI was just feeling sorry for this examinee. As an experienced invigilator and insider, I decided to satisfy your curiosity, so I gave you a hint. If you have anything you wanted to ask, you can come to the confinement room.\u201dHearing the words \u201cinvigilator\u201d and \u201cinsider\u201d, You Huo\u2019s eyes wavered.021 had spoken too quickly. All the information from earlier was only now being processed.As for questions, he indeed had some. This was also his purpose of coming here.\u201cHow safe is the confinement room?\u201d You Huo asked.Qin Jiu took off his watch and unbuttoned his cufflink to reveal his lean and muscular wrist. A few centimetres down from the wrist was a small indicator light about the size of a grain of rice.\u201cSafe enough for me to reveal all the secrets without this thing here lighting up.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cThis is the only place in the system that doesn\u2019t have its eyes or ears.\u201dHe then added: \u201cAs far as I know.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Asked You Huo.Qin Jiu: \u201cBecause of the original rules. The system can interfere with itself, but it cannot interfere with the examinees.\u201d\u201cSo, in a way, examinees can be considered to have the most freedom in this examination system. What you think and do is beyond the systems control. You have the right to do whatever you want including violating the rules, but you will need to bear the consequences.\u201d\u201cThe confinement room is the examinee\u2019s world. It is a place created based on the examinee\u2019s memories and fear. According to the rules of non-intervention, the system cannot spy on them.\u201d\u201cThen what about the invigilators\u2014\u2014\u201d You Huo asked then then frowned: \u201cWhat does that expression of yours mean?\u201dQin Jiu shrugged: \u201cNothing. Just thought that your way of wording things is very interesting.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dQin Jiu said: \u201cI thought you would ask \u2018What about you guys?\u2019 to indicate the division between the two groups. Can I take that as \u2014\u2014-\u201dYou Huo interrupted expressionlessly: \u201cNo.\u201dQin Jiu raised his eyebrow and looked at him for a moment. He then said with a smile that was also not quite a smile: \u201cAlright then, invigilators and examines are different. They\u2026\u2026\u201dThis person even emphasised the word \u201cthey\u201d. You Huo\u2019s expression for a moment turned sour.\u201cThey are regarded as a part of the system and can be intervened with when necessary. This includes their actions, and here.\u201d Qin Jiu knocked against his temple with his knuckles.You Huo: \u201cTo what extent?\u201dQin Jiu was silent for a moment. He then said: \u201cTo any degree. It could just be a short moment; it could also be for a long time. Maybe it just wanted to interfere with a thought, maybe it wanted to change up an entire memory.\u201dHis eyes narrowed in the dark for a moment. He then added: \u201cIt may also be an issue the invigilator themselves. A rumour has been circulating around for a while saying that the original invigilators were not normal people\u2026\u2026..\u201dYou Huo tilted his head a little. His expression was unclear in the dark night: \u201cThe original invigilators? Including the invigilator A you mentioned?\u201dQin Jiu said: \u201cNot to mention whether those lead by him are normal, it is also a question whether they can be considered human.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dSitting on the machine, he used one of the handles as a footrest while his other leg hung down lazily. He quietly watched Qin Jiu for a moment before moving his lips: \u201cI remember you saying that you were incompatible with invigilator A?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what other\u2019s say.\u201d Qin Jiu remembered the scene of the car taillights in the distance and added: \u201cBut it\u2019s indeed not very good.\u201dYou Huo looked at him expressionlessly for a moment. He finally couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cHas your mind been interfered with?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c?\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: *clutches heart and cries bloody tears*Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you said that they were deliberatively pretending to be stupid\u2026\u2026.He wasn\u2019t certain whether 922 was really acting stupid or if he truly was stupid.As for whether they knew about the system and invigilator A, it was difficult for him to tell for now.As for Qin Jiu\u2026\u2026Whether they were \u201cincompatible\u201d or \u201cdidn\u2019t have a very good relationship\u201d, Qin Jiu at the very least should have interacted with him before.Qin Jiu definitely knows invigilator A, yet why didn\u2019t he react when he saw him?Qin Jiu\u2019s reaction contradicted 021\u2019s words.If what 021 said was true and he was indeed invigilator A, then why didn\u2019t Qin Jiu recognise him?Was he deliberately pretending to be a stranger for fun? Or was there something wrong with Qin Jiu?If Qin Jiu was fine, then that would mean 021 was lying. That would mean that this system had nothing to do with him, and he is not the so-called invigilator A she claims he is.\u2026\u2026.You Huo leaned more towards 021 speaking to truth or, at least, the majority of her words should be the truth.Because she really had no reason to go through all those loops to avoid being watched by the system just to make up such a lie to an examinee she had only just met.What could she be planning? To find herself a boss?How bored must she be\u2026\u2026.But speaking the truth didn\u2019t mean that everything she said was true.One person\u2019s perspective and view of something can be very one-sided. He must confirm it again with Qin Jiu.A gust of wind passed through the ruin, sweeping dust along with it.Qin Jiu changed into a more relaxed posture and asked lazily, \u201cAre you trying to curse me out? Or are you asking that question seriously?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d You Huo asked back.\u201cMe? I think you\u2019re trying to curse me out but couldn\u2019t find a reason for it.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cI just gave you an explanation about the system\u2026..Did I say anything that could have upset our top student here?\u201dHe pointed to his ears: \u201cTell me. I\u2019m happy to listen to your complaints. Where have I said something inappropriate? Please point it out.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dAt some unknown point in time, the ridiculous nickname \u201ctop student\u201d had changed into \u201cour top student\u201d.You Huo internally thought\u2026\u2026.If he was deliberately trying to tease him, he probably wouldn\u2019t say something like that.Who would say something like this to someone they hated? Rather than inflicting damage to the other party, you would probably disgust yourself first.He looked at Qin Jiu and suddenly asked out of nowhere: \u201cDo you feel like vomiting?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cWhat?\u201dIt was dark but he could still see the confusion on Qin Jiu\u2019s face clearly.You Huo shook his head: \u201cForget it, it\u2019s nothing. I was asking seriously. Have you ever been interfered with?\u201dQin Jiu didn\u2019t answer this question directly. He instead fell silent for a moment before saying: \u201cMy words may lead to the misunderstanding that the system would interfere with an invigilator\u2019s thoughts without reason or the fact that\u2026\u2026.all invigilators could have been interfered with.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not the case?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d Qin Jiu\u2019s fingers gestured a small gap: \u201cOnly when necessary. And those situations are not very common because there are rules limiting it.\u201dSince the beginning of this examination, You Huo often heard them mentioning one word \u2014- Rules.And later, they would always repeatedly emphasise the importance of that word.This was based on XX rules, this does not meet XX rules, the system needs to follow XX rules.You Huo found it a little hard to understand\u2026\u2026\u201cIf I am not mistaken, the system should be the one governing everything but based on your words, it still needs to follow some rules?\u201d You Huo mocked: \u201cIsn\u2019t this a bit ridiculous?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous? It\u2019s not ridiculous.\u201d Qin Jiu said, \u201cThis is exactly the reason why it thinks it can govern everything. It believes that this is why it is superior. Humans would always violate rules for various reasons, but it won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cIt would never violate any of the rules. No matter the reason. If one day it breaks the rules, it loses the sole reason why it is superior than humans and it would be no different from humans. This is something it cannot stand.\u201dHe said to You Huo: \u201cThere is one particular person\u2026\u2026\u2026You\u2019re someone it dislikes the most.\u201d\u201cConstantly doing things it hates, constantly breaking the rules.\u201d Qin Jiu shrugged and smirked: \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t like the sight of you, yet it can\u2019t get rid of you. As long at it is within the scope of the rules, it would do anything it can to kill you or kick you out.\u201cBut, I\u2019ve always been curious about you\u2026\u2026..\u201d Qin Jiu said.You Huo who was busy massaging his wrist heard this and looked up: \u201cCurious about what?\u201dCurious about why the system seems to be\u2026\u2026\u2026more tolerant towards you.Qin Jiu thought.But this was something he felt based on his own intuition. His intuition told him that the system seemed to be more forgiving towards You Huo, but it was also cautious and sometimes ridiculous.It was more tolerant, so it threw him into the coffin? More tolerate, so it sent him straight into the monster\u2019s mouth?Please read this from kk translatesIf he said that out loud, he would probably be mocked.And so, Qin Jiu just thought this and shook his head: \u201cForget it.\u201dIn general, bastards who only speak halfway without finishing their words would typically be beaten.And those listening would urge them to finish.But unexpectedly, You Huo just calmly let out an \u201coh\u201d and asked: \u201cSo you still haven\u2019t answered the question. Have you been interfered with?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dInvigilator 001 snorted softly: \u201cWhy are you so stubborn about this question?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cBecause you\u2019re stubbornly avoiding it.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dThere was a moment of confrontation between the two. No one moved.You Huo rested his chin on his resting knee and stared at Qin Jiu for a moment. He suddenly asked: \u201cDo you find it shameful?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dQin Jiu touched his chin. On his face was the look of someone who resolutely didn\u2019t want to admit it.In an instant, the fierce tiger backed off.He said vaguely: \u201cWhy should I feel ashamed?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cHow should I know?\u201dQin Jiu looked at him exasperatedly.After a while, he gave up and said: \u201c\u2026\u2026.Alright then.\u201dHe lowered his eyes and flipped Zhao Wentu\u2019s phone over before pressing a few of its buttons.The light from the screen was very dim. Like there was a thin layer of dark fog over it, it was blurred.\u201cThere was indeed a period like that.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cBut the official statement said that it wasn\u2019t interference but a bug in the system which resulted in the involved personnel such as the invigilators getting hurt. Unfortunately, when the bug occurred, I just happened to be at the scene. Because of certain reasons, I was there with a certain someone. In short, I was lucky to have survived. After recuperating for a while, I was able to return. As for what happened over those years\u2026\u2026..due to being accidentally injured, I have already forgotten.\u201dYou Huo\u2019s heart suddenly skipped a beat. He asked: \u201cThat certain someone was referring to invigilator A?\u201d\u201cHow did you know?\u201d His tone was indifferent as usual, but one could faintly tell that he wasn\u2019t very enthusiastic.Because I seem to be that person you\u2019re talking about\u2026..You Huo internally thought.But perhaps it was because the night and environment was too quiet, he hesitated for a moment and didn\u2019t speak.Very soon, Qin Jiu restored back to his usual state: \u201cBut you were right. It was indeed a little shameful. To be interfered with by something that isn\u2019t even human and to have my memory, thoughts and even behaviours controlled indeed makes me feel useless.\u201dYou Huo who was in a similar situation was similarly slapped in the face by the word useless. Internally he called it bullshit.\u201cDid you recover after being interfered with?\u201d He asked.\u201cYes.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cBut with you suddenly caring about me so much, I can\u2019t help but suspect that you have other intentions.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dGet out of here..Suddenly, there was a burst of beeps.The two froze and looked at Zhao Wentu\u2019s phone.Only then did Qin Jiu notice that the night here was strange.Whether it was \u201cafraid of darkness\u201d or the like, it should be ordinary darkness and light should light it back up.But here it was different.The bright light from the screen wasn\u2019t enough to penetrate through the darkness and the writing on the screen was very dim.Qin Jiu stared at the screen. His first reaction wasn\u2019t to turn the phone on but to look at You Huo with surprise.\u201cBlind for a while but I\u2019m fine now. Look at your phone.\u201d You Huo said.Qin Jiu only looked back after a long pause.Zhao Wentu\u2019s phone rang again.Please read this from kk translatesThe small battery icon in the upper right corner of the screen only had a small sliver left. It tirelessly sent out the low battery warning to indicate that it was about to die any moment.This was something Zhao Wentu left for Qin Jiu. Perhaps it was a message to him, or perhaps there are some other information inside.You Huo felt that he was an outsider so, to avoid being too intrusive, he walked away to let Qin Jiu fiddle with the phone..The ruined phone\u2019s sensitivity was very poor. It took Qin Jiu a lot effort before he was able to enter the gallery interface.Zhao Wentu had filmed many things in the rest stop. Just the videos alone amounted to twenty and he couldn\u2019t scroll to the very end.Qin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe screen flickered again indicating that it would let out its last breath any moment.He squinted and tried to read the names of the videos only to end up lost for words.Not one of them were serious\u2026\u2026\u2026\u3010Chicken Speaking with the Duck\u3011\u3010Donkey\u2019s Breakfast\u3011\u3010Get a Dog to Talk to Me\u3011\u2026..What the hell is this?He firmly believed that the video he took of invigilator A wouldn\u2019t be named after animals, so he skipped through a group of animals until he finally reached a suspicious looking video below.The video was named \u2014\u2013 God of Misfortune on the Streets. Mortals Please Avoid.Qin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe video thumbnail depicted a street intersection.This was likely the right one.He tapped it with his finger and watched the screen flicker a few times before suddenly turning black.What a time to die\u2026\u2026...You Huo walked around a broken machine and managed to pry open a metal cover to a box.Inside was a row of neatly lined up explosives.He looked up in surprise, and saw Qin Jiu walk over with a dark expression.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNo power so it turned off. Didn\u2019t get to see what I wanted to see.\u201d Qin Jiu said in a low voice.\u201cIs there a place to charge it?\u201d You Huo turned and looked around.\u201cNone here.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cI searched last time.\u201d\u201cLook for your two subordinates when you\u2019re out?\u201dQin Jiu said: \u201cThis is the only confinement opportunity left. Next time you violate the rules, the invigilators will be following you around full time; you won\u2019t be able to return here.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cWhat now?\u201d\u201cI can only trouble them to come here. 922 will always bring backup chargers when going out.\u201d Qin Jiu looked around and seemed to be looking for something.\u201cHow are you going to do that?\u201d You Huo didn\u2019t know much about the confinement rooms so he didn\u2019t know how they could call an invigilator over after the room had transformed into a ruin site like this.But Qin Jiu knew.\u201cI\u2019ll just make a small commotion to get their attention.\u201dA moment later, he pulled out a shoulder-mounted rocket launcher from the trunk of an old car.From the box You Huo opened, he took out a few explosives.A few seconds later.There was a sudden boom coming from under the cabin, causing the entire ship to shake.The invigilators chatting in the dining room on the second floor were shocked.\u201cFuck!\u201d\u201cWhat the hell is this? Did we hit an iceberg?\u201dIn the confinement room, You Huo watched the explosives explode in the sky. He suddenly felt that this Qin Jiu person was one crazy guy but the next second he couldn\u2019t help but turn his head and laugh.Let me tell you a joke:In order to charge a phone, we\u2019ll make a small commotion.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: So close!!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It pierced through the ruins shrouded in darkness, illuminating half the sky.You Huo suddenly recalled the day when the vision in his eyes were restored. The gauze over his eyes had not yet been completely removed but the light that he had not seen for a long time penetrated through those meshes. Although it couldn\u2019t be said that it brought him joy, it allowed him to slacken and relax.\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201cLaughed?\u201d Qin Jiu glanced at You Huo. He picked up another explosive and skilfully loaded it.He squinted his eyes and again fired another one at the sky.The recoil from it caused dust around him to scatter.Even while standing in a safe area, he could still feel the heat from the explosives.You Huo patted Qin Jiu\u2019s shoulder.The other turned his head with a deep smile on his lips. This man\u2019s arrogance was cleverly wrapped up and concealed by his clothes. He seemed to possess a different kind of madness.\u201cWhy? Want to play with it too?\u201d He asked.\u201cLet me try.\u201d You Huo reached for it.Qin Jiu jokingly moved it away: \u201cI know our top student is very skilled, but this is something you shouldn\u2019t play around with.\u201dYou Huo who\u2019s hands grabbed thin air: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you being childish?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay. Overall quite mature.\u201d Qin Jiu nodded solemnly: \u201cI just wanted to let you know that without professional training, you can easily die from playing around this.\u201dYou Huo glanced at the marking on the side of the barrel.This was a cheaper and simpler version of AT4CSRS so it was slightly heavier compared to the original. It has a range of 300 metres, can be reloaded and has the advantage of being able to be used in a closed space but, if there were anything obstacles behind it, the recoil would likely harm the user.It was indeed something that could result in death if used incorrectly.Qin Jiu may have appeared to have fired it casually, but he didn\u2019t overlook anything. In one glance, you could tell that he was experienced.This was a classic example of putting ones skills into use.\u201cYou\u2019ve been in the army?\u201d You Huo asked.\u201cFour years in the military academy and three years in the army.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cThen I came here.\u201d\u201cMy stay in the army was shorter than yours but I was in the military academy longer than you. Because I skipped grades, I\u2019m also younger than you.\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netYou Huo glanced at him and placed the launcher onto his shoulder. He then kicked Qin Jiu a few times to indicate for him to move aside.\u201cSo, if you didn\u2019t die from this, I won\u2019t die either.\u201dHe half closed his left eye and fired one in one go.Qin Jiu raised his eyebrow. His eyes glanced over at You Huo\u2019s earring before finally settling on the corner of his pursed lips.Another burst of light illuminated the sky.You Huo lowered his hands. The launcher slammed onto the ground.\u201cWill the ship collapse?\u201d He asked.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say.\u201d Qin Jiu lied and made seem as if he was telling the truth, \u201cPerhaps seawater would pour in later. Are you good in water? If you\u2019re not good, I can consider lending you a hand.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter being stared at by those cold eyes for several seconds, invigilator 001 changed his words and said: \u201cYou can just regard the current confinement room as a separate examination centre connected to the invigilator\u2019s ship. The commotion we made wouldn\u2019t result in the ship collapsing. At best, they will just feel a small tremor.\u201d***After three \u201csmall tremors\u201d passed, two plates were broken, three cups of coffee were spilt, and an oil lamp fell and shattered on the second floor of the invigilator\u2019s ship.The four invigilators searched everywhere to find the source of the quakes.The sea was as usual a frozen mass. There wasn\u2019t anything suspicious floating around.There also weren\u2019t any sea monsters seeking death below the ship.After searching around for a long time, they finally\u2026\u2026.in disbelief\u2026..found themselves standing in front of the door to the second confinement room.\u201cIt\u2019s really this place?\u201d 078 was still not convinced: \u201cCan a confinement room cause this? Why haven\u2019t I seen it happen before?\u201d922: \u201cI also haven\u2019t\u2014\u2013\u201dBefore he could finish, there was another bang.The invigilators expressions all fell.922: \u201c\u2026\u2026..I have now seen it.\u201d154 said calmly: \u201cGo open the door.\u201d922 was dissatisfied: \u201cWhy me?\u201d154: \u201cYou\u2019re energetic.\u201d922: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d***After a moment of silence, the door was opened by 922.He cautiously stuck his head in only to find himself next to a blackened wall. Thick smoke filled his nose.\u201cBoss\u2026\u2026.what the hell are you holding?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe moment before the door opened, someone had just finished firing the fourth explosive before shoving the launcher into his hands in attempt to push the last two explosions onto him.It was the classic move of someone playing their fill and then turning their back.Qin Jiu snorted. Holding the launcher, he stepped forward and said to 922: \u201cYou came just in time. I need you for something.\u201d922 was startled by the launcher: \u201cWhat happened? Is there a problem with the confinement room?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cThen could there be another system bug?\u201d 922 was even more worried.\u201cWhat?! System bug?!\u201d 154 who was outside also stuck his head in, \u201cBoss, are you okay?! Anyone hurt?\u201d078 and 021 were also startled. They all grabbed the door and rushed in.For the first time, You Huo saw the invigilators expressions change one after another. One after another, their faces turned pale with shock.Qin Jiu however said: \u201cDon\u2019t panic, the system is okay. There are no bugs. Those grabbing the door can let go.\u201d\u201cReally okay?\u201d\u201cReally.\u201d922\u2019s neck seemingly grew another inch. He stretched his neck out and looked around.Seeing that nothing strange appeared to be going on, he let out a sigh of relief.Qin Jiu saw their startled behaviour and couldn\u2019t help but say: \u201cEven if there was a bug, did you have to be so anxious?\u201d\u201cOf course\u2026\u2026\u201d 922 said: \u201cEven you couldn\u2019t deal with a bug and had to recuperate in the ICU for two years so how could we not be anxious\u2026\u2026\u201d154 tugged furiously at his sleeve but he was unfortunately a little too late. This stupid colleague of his had already finished speaking.Qin Jiu glanced at 922 before asking 154: \u201c922 came here rather late so how did he know about it? Did you tell him?\u201d154 silently covered his face. He then said with a guilty conscience: \u201cWe touched on that topic during one of our conversations.\u201d078 this idiot also tried to join the excitement: \u201cIsn\u2019t it normal knowing about this? I heard about it as soon as I joined our team. I heard it was very scary and dangerous and you were even announced dead several times. There was blood everywhere and even several plates of metal\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe found himself met with Qin Jiu\u2019s cold and indifferent gaze. He then reacted and stopped himself: \u201cUh\u2026\u2026.It was something like that.\u201d\u201cThe creativity and embellishment is not bad. It exaggerated the dangerousness of a system bug.\u201d Qin Jiu added calmly.078 said: \u201cIt\u2019s indeed a little\u2026\u2026..the system bug is one thing but the legendary invigilator A may have also played a role. If not, you wouldn\u2019t have been hurt that ba\u2014\u2014\u2014Ow\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dThis punching bag suddenly yelped in pain. When he looked down at his foot, he saw the heel of Miss 021\u2019s high heel pressed down onto his toes.\u201cMiss, you\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d021 stopped and gently let out an \u201cah\u201d: \u201cSorry, I was too anxious trying to get in.\u201d078 slid down against the door frame clutching his foot. He quietly uttered out: \u201cIt\u2019s alright\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYour team is unexpectedly quite concerned about me. I\u2019m a little flattered.\u201d Qin Jiu pulled 078 up, \u201cWhat else did you chat about? Tell me?\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netHis attitude was quite good, and there was also a hint of playfulness in his words.078 hopped a few times before finally recovering from the pain: \u201cThat was about it. In fact, we only just talked about it a few times when I first entered the team. I was new after all\u2026\u2026so I was curious about everything. We tried guessing what the bug was like, how you dealt with it and also where invigilator A may have gone. After going through all kinds of possibilities and no longer having anything else to guess, we stopped talking about it.\u201dQin Jiu who heard those words of his suddenly found it a little funny.As the person involved, he would occasionally remember that incident over the past few years. It appeared that this was the same for those outsiders\u2014\u2014\u2013They would similarly try to guess what could have possibly happened that day, guess how everything was resolved and guess what may have happened to invigilator A.He had no memory about the first two and there was no data he could access left in the system. Just purely speculating wasn\u2019t enough.As for the last one\u2026\u2026.Although he couldn\u2019t remember and he couldn\u2019t find the relevant information, but based on the system\u2019s usual operations, to an extent the answer could be inferred.That invigilator A was either dead or abolished. Since he was removed from the system, his memory should have also been wiped.A long time ago, 154 had rashly asked him about that incident.\u201cBoss, what if\u2026\u2026I\u2019m only asking what if. What if invigilator is not dead and you meet him again one day?\u201dAt that time Qin Jiu said: \u201cMeet him? He doesn\u2019t remember me; I don\u2019t remember him. Something like this can\u2019t be called meeting. It\u2019s strangers sharing the same path.\u201d154: \u201cThen if you recognised him?\u201d\u201cGive him back a few critical condition notices?\u201d Qin Jiu replied casually. After a while, he also lazily added: \u201c\u2026\u2026I would probably ask him to stay away. Regardless of whether we really didn\u2019t get along, nothing good seems to come from with us being together.\u201d.Qin Jiu blinked a few times before returning to his senses and said to 078 and the others: \u201cAlright now. The others should go back and rest. I just needed 922 for something. I don\u2019t need such a big audience here.\u201dAll the invigilators there internally said: Your actions earlier clearly didn\u2019t mean that!922 asked: \u201cWhat do you need me for?\u201dQin Jiu stretched his hand out: \u201cDid you bring your portable charger? Lend it to me.\u201d922: \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d922: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d922: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAt this moment, 078 finally realised what a terrible idea it was to confine them together.In order to avoid wasting more time, he brazenly separated the two great masters. You Huo was sent back to the first confinement room while Qin Jiu continued to stay in the second confinement room.Before turning around and going over to the room next door, You Huo pulled Qin Jiu over and tried to say something.But he then remembered 078\u2019s words from earlier including the mention of all the death notices and the metal plates. He felt that it was inappropriate telling Qin Jiu that he was invigilator A at a time like this\u2026\u2026For once the atmosphere between them wasn\u2019t bad. Why bother ruining it?Moreover, he still didn\u2019t have conclusive evidence to prove that he was once invigilator A.If he had not yet clarified it, why bother dragging someone else in?.The second half of this round of confinement was extraordinarily long.At the very least, time seemed to be particularly long for Qin Jiu as he waited for the phone to come back to life\u2026\u2026..It almost felt like a century.The phone seemed to be deliberately playing with him.It chose to suddenly turn on just before 922 returned to reopen the door.Qin Jiu didn\u2019t waste any time this time and quickly clicked into that video.As soon as the play button was selected, the street in the video came alive.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: The video finally plays!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From an empty street to an ordinary apartment building, to a commercial street, it then finally stopped on a man\u2019s face.The man looked very thin and pallid. There were dark shadows under his eyes, but his eyes were still bright and energetic.It was Zhao Wentu who had not yet become a villager.It wasn\u2019t until he saw this video that Qin Jiu realised that the man who had been writing \u201cBrother Qin\u201d here and \u201cBrother Qin\u201d there in the diary was actually a young man who had not yet graduated from university.He turned on the sound.Zhao Wentu\u2019s voice sounded: \u201c\u2014\u2014\u2013I just came out of the apartment to find something to eat. This is today\u2019s street. Even if I throw a stick around, I won\u2019t hit anyone. There aren\u2019t even any birds.\u201dThe camera again turned back to the empty street crossing.Zhao Wentu explained: \u201cSee that? If you continued down there you will see a mass of white fog. That\u2019s where the examination centre was. We went through that fog to reach this rest stop. I have been wondering about it the past few days; if I went back and walked through that fog, what would I see? Would there be monsters in there? Would I return to the previous examination centre? Or would I be taken somewhere else?\u201dThe camera shook slightly as he walked.As the man spoke, he even walked towards the fog for a while.\u201cForget it. I\u2019m a little scared. I think I\u2019ll just\u2014\u2014Huh?\u201d Zhao Wentu suddenly stopped moving.The camera shook.\u201cScared me. Why would someone suddenly appear from there\u2026.\u201d He muttered.Because he was scared, he seemed to have turned around and ran a few steps.But he then quickly stopped himself.\u201cWait a minute, wait a minute\u2026\u2026.That seems to be my Brother Qin!\u201dZhao Wentu\u2019s tone gave away the fact that he was happy.The camera then shook again. It was accompanied by a shutter sound.But it quickly stabilised again.From the looks of the swaying branches in the background, he seemed to have avoided the road and was standing by a fence somewhere.Zhao Wentu\u2019s voice suddenly became clearer. He seemed to be speaking closely to the microphone.\u201cInvigilator A! That invigilator A is also there standing next to Brother Qin. I wonder what they\u2019re talking about. The service desk mentioned that invigilators generally don\u2019t come to the rest stops. This might be the only time I can take a picture of the invigilator\u2026\u2026.. In a way, it\u2019s also a photo of the system. I hope I can get through this examination alive so that this video won\u2019t be useless.\u201d\u201cHere\u2026\u2026\u2026that\u2019s the god of misfortune\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dWith Zhao Wentu\u2019s words, the camera focused back at the corner of the intersection.\u2026\u2026..The originally empty intersection suddenly had some life.A car was parked by the side of the road. It was a low-key black colour. It coincided with the scene from Qin Jiu\u2019s memory.Please read this from kk translatesThere were two people standing by the car. They were both very tall, making the dusty newsstand nearby appear rather small.But the one on the left was several centimetres taller.With his jacket hanging on his arm, he leaned against the car door while speaking. The buttons on the collar of his shirt were not buttoned and it was casually left open. The outlines of his muscles were very prominent as he crossed his arms.That was Qin Jiu himself from a few years ago.His features had not changed much, but his hair was shorter, and he looked prouder. That lazy and arrogant demeanour of his was even more unrestrained back then.As for the person next to him\u2026\u2026.Even if the camera was quite far away, you could tell that he was an extremely handsome young man. Under the light from the setting sun, his skin was still dazzling pale.He was wearing a simple plain shirt, army green trousers and his calf was wrapped in high topped leather boots. As he listened to the other person speak, he would always have his brows furrowed into a cold look that also seemed to carry a hint of sleepiness.That outfit would occasionally appear in the system\u2019s long-forgotten data. It was the earliest version of the invigilators uniform but in those forgotten photos, none wore it as well as he did..The phone flickered and, for a short moment, the screen was covered in static.However, it was as if Qin Jiu was not aware of this. His eyes remained fixed on the screen. It stared motionlessly..By the time the static was gone, the scene had zoomed in.Zhao Wentu probably felt that he was too far and that it wasn\u2019t close enough to record all the details of the two men, so he zoomed in closer.The appearance of that young man could now be seen clearly on the screen\u2026\u2026..Familiar eyes, familiar lips and even the occasional look of impatience and habit of touching his earlobe while frowning\u2026\u2026\u2026It couldn\u2019t be more familiar.The only difference was that his earlobe here was empty. There was no eye-catching earring there.\u2026\u2026\u2026Less than two hours ago, he was still standing inside this confinement room, standing next to Qin Jiu.They haven\u2019t even known each other for more than a month.Here, Qin Jiu called him \u201ctop student\u201d and the system called him \u201cExaminee You Huo\u201d.But in the video from many years ago, he was \u201cInvigilator A\u201d..Qin Jiu watched his past self move away from the car, straighten up and say something.From the angle the video was taken, he couldn\u2019t read his lips.Invigilator A then walked straight past him to open the door to the driver\u2019s seat.He leaned onto the roof of the car and said a phrase expressionlessly.This time, Qin Jiu could see it.He said: \u201cI hope you are true to your words. It\u2019s best that we don\u2019t meet again.\u201dWith his back to the camera, Qin Jiu raised his hand, pointed to his temple and then pointed to his ear. He seemed to be jokingly indicating that he has heard his words and will not meet again.The scene here probably took place in late autumn. Even the setting sun in the west couldn\u2019t warm the place up.Dead leaves by the wall swirled into a vortex as the wind blew past.Invigilator A got into the car.Soon afterwards, the car turned around and drive off down the street. In a blink of an eye, it had disappeared into the white fog..This time, it should have been 078 who was supposed to let them out once the punishment was done.This warrior sat in his room for an hour before suddenly realising that he may have mentioned something he shouldn\u2019t have mentioned. At the very least, it was something unpleasant and it made that 001 unhappy.He debated over it for a long time before finally deciding to find a sacrifice. He quickly swapped shifts with 922.922 still retained some trauma from the rocket launcher earlier. Fearing that he would be hit as soon as he opened the door, he tried knocking first.No one answered\u2026\u2026\u2026.The sound insulation of the confinement room was pretty good. From outside, it sounded completely quiet.922 knocked on the door again. Still, there was no response.He found it strange and decided to go ahead and unlock the door.\u201cBoss, the punishment time is over.\u201dHe said that as he walked through. The moment he turned around; he froze.It wasn\u2019t that Qin Jiu wasn\u2019t there.He was standing there, standing very close to the confinement room door. He held an old phone in his hand from which soft static sounds could be heard.He didn\u2019t know what it was playing but Qin Jiu was staring at the screen the entire time. He didn\u2019t even notice him coming in.\u201cBoss?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d922 was confused. He walked over to Qin Jiu\u2019s side.When he looked at the phone, the video was showing the second half.After just watching a few seconds, he froze.922 recognised the first-generation invigilator uniform.922 also knows what You Huo\u2019s face looked like.But when the two are put together\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.He suddenly couldn\u2019t recognise him anymore.It wasn\u2019t until the video began to loop that 922 suddenly returned to his senses.There was a knock on the door. 154\u2019s muffled voice travelled into the room.\u201c922? Where are you? Did you get lost on your way to release our boss?\u201d922 was shocked. When he turned his head around, Qin Jiu had already looked back up.\u201cBoss\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d 922 pointed at the screen and then he pointed outside: \u201cWhy would that person be in here? Isn\u2019t that the first-generation invigilator uniform? Why would he be wearing it?\u201d\u201cWho\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.is this?\u201dThere was the sound of the door outside unlocking.As the confinement room door opened, the light that suddenly poured in blinded Qin Jiu who squinted his eyes in response.They had been in the room for a while and everyone was waiting outside.154 breathed a sigh of relief when he saw them. He then said angrily: \u201cScared me. I thought something happened again. This round of confinement really is\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d021 next to him added: \u201cExhausting both physically and mentally.\u201d154 subconsciously nodded. He then glanced at Qin Jiu and quickly shook his head: \u201cActually, it\u2019s not that bad.\u201dNext to them, You Huo was leaning lazily against the porthole waiting for them to finish. He subconsciously fiddled with his earring with one hand. He raised his eyelid and looked over at Qin Jiu with his light brown eyes that seemed slightly transparent under the oil lamp.For a moment, his appearance overlapped with invigilator A in the video.It was as if he had never changed after all those years.\u2026\u2026\u2026..Qin Jiu\u2019s lips moved.As if he was possessed, he turned off the phone and stored it back inside his pocket before looking at You Huo and saying to 922: \u201cNobody.\u201d922: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dAm I blind\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..?.On the way back, the atmosphere inside the ship was very strange.Even 154 who was a rather tolerant person could no longer stand it, but he couldn\u2019t tell why it felt strange.It wasn\u2019t until the small white ship reached the shore and he watched the two disappear back into the cave that he realised\u2026\u2026..Please read this from kk translatesThese two gods of misfortune didn\u2019t make 922 make them supper?\u201cDid something happen in the confinement room? Why do I feel that boss\u2019s mood is strange? You as well. You have been lost in thought ever since you came out. What have you been thinking about?\u201d He nudged 922 who had lost his soul.922 returned to his senses and look at him.Everything in the video flashed through his mind\u2026\u2026.He knew that the uniform in there was something only worn by the earliest group of invigilators. After that, it was abolished, and casual wear was allowed.He had also seen pretty much everyone from the earliest group of invigilators. Even if he didn\u2019t see them in person, he had seen them through photos.All except for one\u2026\u2026\u2026.Invigilator A\u2026\u2026\u2026..922 grabbed onto 154 and let out a curse: \u201cFuck!\u201dAs soon as he was about to speak, he lost his footing.With two consecutive splashes, 154 was dragged straight into the sea by this unlucky colleague of his.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Finally revealed!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A pure idiot.078 and 021 reacted very quickly. From the moment they noticed it and until they were pulled back up, it took less than twenty minutes.But in this sea of ice, twenty minutes was enough for one to lose half their life.Fortunately, although Miss 021 didn\u2019t like Qin Jiu, she wasn\u2019t someone who would just sit around and do nothing. She also regarded 154 and 922 as colleagues.She strode over quickly in her high heels. With her hands, she popped open a bottle of alcohol and poured it all into a bucket.After emptying out almost ten bottles, she instructed 078 and said: \u201cThese are all that I could find. I left a bottle for them to drink later. Rub this into them first. Remember, they can only go warm up by the fire after you warm them up with this or those two unlucky ones would be roasted crisp.\u201d078 was also a high-ranking invigilator so he understood what she meant. It was just that his reaction was a little slower than Miss Decisive so he could only follow her instructions: \u201cOkay, okay, okay. Understood.\u201d\u201cIt must be done quickly otherwise their skin will be gone.\u201d 021 said.078 said: \u201cBig sister, I only have two hands\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou want me to rub one of them?\u201d 021 kicked the bucket over to him, \u201cIf you really can\u2019t, give them the bucket. Let the two of them rub each other.\u201d078 imagined that scene. Pretty good.He shouted out \u201cgood idea\u201d and ran off with the bucket.Hearing the sound of his footsteps disappear upstairs, 021 turned around and rekindled the fire stove.Along with small crackling sounds, the fire in the stove grew bigger.021 squatted there watching the fire for a while before nestling into a nearby chair.The living room was extremely warm, but her expression was sombre.Following the end of the confinement, she had used that opportunity to say a few more things to You Huo.In fact, it couldn\u2019t be called \u201csaying something to You Huo\u201d. She was only passing on a message. It was invigilator A asking her to pass a key message to his future self \u2014\u2014-\u3010Go to the rest stop. Find a thing and a person.\u3011You Huo asked her: \u201cWhich rest stop?\u201dShe said: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dYou Huo asked: \u201cWhat does it mean by finding a thing?\u201dShe said: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dYou Huo asked: \u201cWho to find?\u201dShe said: \u201cI also\u2026\u2026don\u2019t know.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dUnable to answer any of his questions, Miss Decisive covered her face in shame: \u201cYou probably can\u2019t find a worse messenger than me.\u201dPlease read this from kk translates\u201cIt has nothing to do with you.\u201d You Huo casually comforted her: \u201cThe problem lies with the person not speaking properly.\u201dFor a moment 021 didn\u2019t know whether she should mock him.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Until this moment, their conversation was quite normal.She patted her chest and said that she will definitely help him find clues while the other party expressed his gratitude.The atmosphere was very harmonious\u2026\u2026..But soon afterwards, You Huo suddenly asked: \u201cHow bad was my relationship with 001?\u201dAnd just asking wasn\u2019t enough, this former invigilator even tried to get her to give an example.Give your grandma an example!Do you even need an example for something like this?But because time was limited, she couldn\u2019t elaborate. What was most frustrating was that she really didn\u2019t know much.At this moment, 021 began to contemplate. Where could she go to find something that would let this invigilator see for himself?There were suddenly footsteps coming from the stairs.078 had returned with his two colleagues who had just taken a dip in the sea.021 restored her expression and watched them sit down by the fire. Each wrapped in a blanket, 154 and 922 huddled on the sofa shivering intensely.\u201cBetter?\u201d 021 asked.078 nodded: \u201cIn any case we just rubbed everywhere. The skin was even rubbed red. I only brought them down here once they started to warm up.\u201d154 was wrapped tightly by the blanket and only his flushed face was exposed. Those who weren\u2019t aware would have thought that he was embarrassed but, in fact, he even had the urge to kill 922.\u201cY-y-y-y-you tell m-me\u2026.\u201d His teeth chattered as he asked 922. \u201cWhy were you o-o-o-out of it? What were you t-thinking for you to f-f-fall into the sea? I r-r-remember you trying to s-s-say something\u2026.\u201d922 was huddled next to him. Because of his height, the blanket wrapped around him made him look like a large silkworm.What he was thinking of before falling in \u2013 He remembered it very clearly.He had heard that the phone was something another examinee left behind so that video should be something taken many years ago. Within that video was Qin Jiu who was still an examinee and invigilator A who still existed.And that invigilator A was You Huo\u2026\u2026.He recalled the rumours over the past few years. It all said that invigilator A was likely dead; that he was eliminated by the system.But now, it seems that he not only didn\u2019t die, he had returned back to the system. This time, however, he had changed his identity and had become an examinee.Based on their previous interactions\u2026\u2026\u2026. He probably no longer remembered the past.So, what was his purpose of returning this time?\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Something like this was shocking but he was able to calm back down after taking a dip in the sea.What really surprised 922 was Qin Jiu\u2019s reaction.He had previously heard from 154\u2019s end matters involving his boss\u2019s injury and memory loss, and a name that would be mentioned every time was invigilator A.It was a well-known fact that these two were arch enemies.Shouldn\u2019t arch enemies take advantage of the situation and bring more trouble to the other party to address their inner grievances?But why was Qin Jiu\u2019s first reaction after watching the video to say \u201cnobody\u201d? Was he subconsciously trying to hide it?It would be understandable if he was trying to hide it from You Huo but why was he also hiding it from his closest subordinate?If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he knew that the relationship between the two was bad and that Qin Jiu didn\u2019t have a good attitude towards invigilator A\u2026\u2026.922 would\u2019ve even suspected\u2026\u2026\u2026.that this form of concealment was a disguised attempt to protect.But that definitely couldn\u2019t be it.922 thought: Perhaps he had something else in mind?He shrank inside his blanket. Even after mulling over it for a long time, he couldn\u2019t figure out what Qin Jiu wanted to do.But this didn\u2019t stop him from siding unconditionally with his boss.\u201c922?\u201d\u201cFool?\u201d\u201cStu\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d 922 abruptly returned to his senses as 154 continuously worsened his name calling.154 pursed his lips for a few seconds before saying: \u201cI\u2019m asking you a question. What did you want to say earlier?\u201d922 shivered while internally giving his apologies. With his mouth, he said: \u201cI\u2026\u2026.ah, it\u2019s too fucking cold. What did I want to say? I\u2019ve f-f-forgotten.\u201d154\u2019s expression turned dark. Internally he cursed: Damn you and your grandmother. If I don\u2019t beat you to death, I will take your surname..This round of confinement lasted for three hours. By the time they were released, it was midnight.Snoring could be heard coming from the cave. The main source of it were the crew members who had eaten their fill and didn\u2019t have anything else to worry about. The examinees on the other hand were sitting there with their eyes wide open, looking like a group of perched owls.Amongst them, Di Li and his teammate were still holding onto a wooden stick. On the wooden stick hung the dead rabbit.It was as if they were holding out an offering waiting respectfully for someone\u2019s arrival.Please read this from kk translates\u201cHungry again?\u201d You Huo whose eyes were blinded by the sight of the roasted rabbit the moment he entered the cave asked.Di Li: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Even if I starve to death, I wouldn\u2019t eat this.\u201d\u201cThen why are you holding it?\u201d\u201cWe were planning on getting rid of it\u2026\u2026.\u201d Di Li wanted to say that it was because the others didn\u2019t dare touch it.Shu Xue and Wu Li dared to, but the two of them are thin and fragile so he felt bad asking them to dispose of the rabbit. He could only do it himself.\u201cThen why haven\u2019t you disposed of it?\u201d\u201cSince you guys roasted it, I was afraid that you guys really did want to eat it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cSo, are you guys still eating?\u201d Di Li asked cautiously.\u201cNot interested.\u201d You Huo wanted to tell him to dispose of it but he remembered that he was also referring to Qin Jiu when he said \u201cyou guys\u201d. What if Qin Jiu wanted to?\u201cWhat about you? Eating?\u201d He looked back and asked.The moment he looked back, he saw Qin Jiu who stood a step behind him look at him with a very, very complicated expression.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s just eating a rabbit. Do you need to be so conflicted?He stopped his steps and asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dQin Jiu who was lost in thought suddenly returned to his senses.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Nothing.\u201d He quickly furrowed his brows and pinched his nose bridge a few times.It was as if he suddenly felt sleepy and was struggling to stay awake.When you looked back again, he had already returned to normal.\u201cWhat? Did you specially leave this thing here for our supper?\u201d He asked Di Li.Di Li froze for a moment. He spoke with surprise: \u201cYou\u2019re really eating?\u201d\u201cJust joking around.\u201d Qin Jiu reached his hand out: \u201cGive it here. I\u2019ll bury it at the entrance. It might still be able to talk once it\u2019s frozen again.\u201dAs soon as those words were said, the expressions of many examinees changed.\u201cDon\u2019t go out\u2026..\u201d Di Li said.The others hurriedly nodded.\u201cYes, don\u2019t go out.\u201d\u201cWait until the sun rises.\u201d\u201cWhat time is it now? Is it 3, 4 o\u2019clock yet? Anyone have a watch? Or we can secretly borrow the crew members watch to check?\u201d\u201c3:30am. It won\u2019t be long till dawn. Let\u2019s wait until then before doing anything.\u201dAll these murmurs didn\u2019t help You Huo with figuring out the situation.Shu Xue waved the two over: \u201cSometime happened earlier. You two went to the invigilator\u2019s quarter so you don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d You Huo walked over.\u201cThere\u2019s something approaching outside.\u201d Shu Xue said.\u201cApproaching? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like this\u2026\u2026\u2026..After you two were taken away to the invigilator\u2019s quarter, everyone here wanted to change shifts so that one half is resting and the other half waits for your return. I was part of the latter group\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAt that time, the resting group fell asleep very quickly. The cave was soon filled with soft breathing sounds.Shu Xue was leaning against the wall poking at the fire when she suddenly heard a very strange speaking voice.It sounded like several people whispering at the same time. Mixed to some light humming, she couldn\u2019t decipher the contents.There were four men guarding at the entrance of the cave, so Shu Xue thought they were chatting quietly to relieve their boredom. As such, she didn\u2019t pay it much heed.But soon, that whispering sound was heard again. This time, she looked specifically at the four men only to see that they were lost in thoughts. No one was speaking\u2026\u2026.She then waited a little more. When the whispering sounds appeared again, she leaned forward and looked around.She then finally found the source of the sound\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026That sound didn\u2019t come from inside the cave. Instead, it came from somewhere outside. It travelled into the cave through the thick stone walls.Shu Xue didn\u2019t want to take any changes. She immediately told the other night watchmen about her discovery.Everyone immediately leaned against the wall to listen to the strange sound.\u201cWe heard it six times in total.\u201d Shu Xue said: \u201cWhat was scary was that every time the sound was heard, it sounded like it was a little closer than before.\u201dDi Li interjected: \u201cThat\u2019s right. Not long before you returned, a few of us took a fire torch and pointed it at the cave entrance but found nothing.\u201d\u201cPointed it at the entrance?\u201d You Huo glanced at the cave entrance: \u201cHow did you do it?\u201dDi Li cleared his throat. He then walked over to the cave entrance, did a lunge and swept the fire torch around: \u201cJust\u2026\u2026.like this.\u201dYou Huo gave up.He went over to a fire and bent down to pick up a fire torch.Di Li asked: \u201cYou\u2026\u2026..what are you doing?\u201d\u201cGoing out to take a look.\u201d As You Huo said this, he reached out to pick up a second one.But before he grabbed the next one, he stopped.Ever since the beginning of this exam, he and Qin Jiu had always been together whenever something significant happened.In fact, it wasn\u2019t that often but strangely enough, it had now become a habit for him.He would habitually think that \u201cgoing out to take a look\u201d referred to the two of them.You Huo\u2019s fingers stopped several centimetres away from the fire. His expression was cold and indifferent, but inside he felt awkward.But this awkwardness didn\u2019t last long.His finger moved. He eventually seemingly nonchalantly picked up a second fire torch.For reasons even ghosts wouldn\u2019t know, he didn\u2019t want Qin Jiu to know that he is invigilator A for the time being.According to what he had heard, as someone who was always going against Qin Jiu, invigilator A should be someone who would rather be beaten to death than invite his enemy out to work together.He was now doing the opposite. Even if Qin Jiu had ten brains, he wouldn\u2019t associate him with invigilator.Perfect.He held up the fire torch and glanced at Qin Jiu. For the first time in 800 years, he took the initiative and asked: \u201cComing?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dPerhaps it was too surprising. Invigilator 001 was so happy; his expression was completely stiff.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net<Table of Contents>Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netClickNovel has something to say: They both know but they don\u2019t know each other knows \ud83d\ude05Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Every slap was received by him.You Huo handed the fire torch over.Qin Jiu wordlessly received it.He stood in place for two seconds before suddenly turning his head to the side and covering his face.Noticing that he wasn\u2019t keeping up, You Huo stopped and asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dQin Jiu massaged his jaw: \u201cFace hurts.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cForget it, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Qin Jiu added some more fire to his fire torch and followed: \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe moment they reached the cave entrance, they were stopped by someone.In addition to the two activists Di Li and Brother Li, there was also Chen Fei and Huang Rui who often filled the final place position.\u201cWhy, not letting us go?\u201d Qin Jiu asked.Chen Fei shook his head: \u201cNo, we\u2026\u2026we have a request.\u201d\u201cSpeak.\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t like to be stopped and didn\u2019t much patience. He coldly threw out a single word.Chen Fei and Huang Rui glanced at each other. They then said cautiously: \u201cCan we go too? We promise not to drag you down.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cWhat kind of request is this?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dChen Fei was a little embarrassed.In comparison, Huang Rui was much more direct.He scratched his head and said: \u201cThat was just one thing. Another request is\u2026\u2026.If. If there is time, can you teach us a little bit about dealing with the monster?\u201dAfter he was done, Huang Rui again explained: \u201cBased on the current situation, it looks like the two of us are bound to be last. The sun\u2019s about to rise and we\u2019re getting closer and closer to the second night. I heard you two say earlier that the monster\u2019s legs were cut off and it had escaped but we\u2019re still afraid\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dChen Fei nodded and said: \u201cDon\u2019t laugh at us. We are really scared. We have always been thinking about what we should do if the monster appears again tomorrow night.\u201dYou Huo\u2019s skill in freezing someone was sufficient, but he was lacking in his ability to comfort others.He listened quietly for a while and suddenly nudged Qin Jiu.Qin Jiu stared at his arm that was nudged before slowly speaking up to comfort the others: \u201cThere\u2019s no point worrying. There is an 80% chance of it coming back.\u201dYou Huo corrected: \u201c90.\u201dChen Fei: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dWith their slim hope crushed, the expressions of the two in last place were extremely pale.\u201cThen\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Huang Rui swallowed several times. He did his best to calm himself down but he couldn\u2019t form a complete sentence.He repeated the word \u2018then\u2019 several times as Qin Jiu finally turned his attention away from his elbow that was nudged and You Huo.\u201cWhat did you ask just now?\u201d Qin Jiu for a moment couldn\u2019t remember.Huang Rui: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cHow we dealt with the monster, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dQin Jiu shook the fire torch in his hand and said: \u201cWe relied on this.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Chen Fei and Huang Rui looked puzzled: \u201cBut\u2026\u2026..did you bring along a fire torch when you disappeared? You didn\u2019t, right?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cWe didn\u2019t. He has a lighter.\u201d\u201cLighter?\u201d The two were doubtful: \u201cThat little flame worked?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cI guess. Just burnt that thing\u2019s mouth.\u201dYou Huo: ?\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net\u201cTh-that monster was so easy to deal with?\u201dChen Fei and Huang Rui looked at each other.They felt that it sounded a little unreal\u2026\u2026.No, not just a little. It was too unreal. To rely on a small lighter like that, you could deal with something so scary?With just that monster\u2019s size, overturning a ship with its tentacles alone was not a problem. Just its eyes were about the size of half a human and it was also something that could stretch, shrink and change its shape as it pleased.Just a small flame was enough?Why are you trying to trick?But when Qin Jiu spoke, he didn\u2019t appear to be joking. Instead, everything was said lazily.It was as if he would answer casually any question he was asked but he didn\u2019t have any intention to elaborate.But for some reason, it was very persuasive.Perhaps it was because he didn\u2019t panic that he seemed reliable? Or perhaps it was because of his deep voice that gave them a sense of trustworthiness?Chen Gai and Huang Rui felt complicated. The more they thought about it the more it seemed\u2026\u2026\u2026like it wasn\u2019t impossible?\u201cReally?\u201d Chen Fei checked again.Qin Jiu looked at him through half-lidded eyes with a look that said \u2018it\u2019s up to you whether or not you believe it\u2019s true\u2019.Chen Fei quickly shrank his neck back and answered himself: \u201cIt should be true.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c?\u201d\u201cIf a small fire from the lighter was enough, then wouldn\u2019t it be easier for us if we each carried a fire torch?\u201d Huang Rui who finished saying that felt that he had spoken too rashly and added: \u201cI mean, that way it wouldn\u2019t be that scary.\u201dChen Fei then asked suspiciously: \u201cBut when the monster\u2019s mouth is closed, the lighter may still work for a while. Would a fire torch this big really not go out?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cThen bring along two more knifes or some other form of sharp weapon. That would be enough.\u201dThe two bowed their head in thought again.\u201cIf you have time, it would be better to use it to find a useful weapon.\u201d Qin Jiu said and glanced at You Huo before the two left one after another.***When Chen Fei, Di Li and the others rushed out with their fire torches, the two great masters had long disappeared.\u201cAre there any strange gates in this place? How did they disappear so quickly?\u201d Di Li muttered.\u201cIt\u2019s all our fault. We probably annoyed them with our questions.\u201d Huang Ruin was a little frustrated, \u201cI knew we should have accompanied around the island first before asking.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d The good-tempered Brother Li again began to speak nonsense: \u201cThose who are too outstanding all tend to have a bit of a lonely personality because they can\u2019t get along with others. Those two look like they\u2019re used to going around alone.\u201dDi Li pouted: \u201cThat\u2019s not right. They\u2019re clearly going around in pairs.\u201dBrother Li: \u201cThey just happened to get along.\u201dDi Li was a little discouraged: \u201cI think they just didn\u2019t want to take us along.\u201dIn any case, he was also the top ranked player here. To some extent, he was doing alright.But with those two here, he couldn\u2019t keep up with their pace and conversely felt like he was just taken for a ride.With that head of grey hair bowed down, Brother Li found it a little funny: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Xiao Di classmate?\u201dDi Li said glumly: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m dragging them down. This is the first time in my life that I\u2019ve felt like this.\u201d\u201cActually, it\u2019s not you. How should I put it\u2026\u2026.What did we rely on to get points before this?\u201d Brother Li asked.\u201cBravery and tactics.\u201d Di Li who blew his own horn covered his face in embarrassment.\u201cI guess so.\u201d Brother Li said: \u201cThink about it. What is bravery? After confirming the answer, deciding what you must decide?\u201dDi Li: \u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cThen what about tactics? It\u2019s for us to act carefully; not to be reckless. To plan everything one step at a time before reaching our final objective. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dDi Li: \u201cYeah\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201d\u201cNow think about what those two rely on to get points.\u201d Brother Li.Di Li thought about it. He realised that of those two, one relied on acting wildly while the other relied on force\u2026\u2026..\u201cIsn\u2019t it the complete opposite?\u201d Brother Li asked. \u201cIt\u2019s along the lines of them earning points by failing while you do it following the normal procedures. Even if you wanted to drag them down, it\u2019s impossible because the starting points for both of you were different from the very beginning.\u201dDi Li suddenly came to a realisation.\u201cThen what do we do?\u201d Di Li asked.Brother Li wanted to say that they should taken care of themselves well so as not to become a burden to the others.But before he could speak, he heard Di Li suggest with epiphany: \u201cWe lose out minds too and join them?\u201dBrother Li: \u201cHuh?\u201d***You Huo had no knowledge of the conversation that took place at the entrance of the cave.He just knew that with Qin Jiu\u2019s ramble earlier, those who wanted to follow weren\u2019t able to keep up. Perhaps they had formed another group and had gone in another direction.There were only the two of them on this road.The flames flickered past the frozen ice, giving the snow-white surface an orange-yellow tinge.Their shadows wavered under the fire.This island tour was different from what You Huo had envisioned. The atmosphere was a little strange.But for someone who never usually paid attention to the atmosphere to think this\u2026\u2026\u2026that in itself was very strange.He held the fire torch in one hand and his other hand was tucked in his pocket. You Huo\u2019s eyes swept across the reef.As someone who was accustomed to the cold, he actually felt that this road was too quiet. There was only the sound of ice crunching under their feet. He walked ahead while Qin Jiu walked half a step behind him.You Huo listened for a while before suddenly asking: \u201cWy did you lie to them just now?\u201d\u201cTo let them toughen up a little.\u201d Qin Jiu said, \u201cFor them to be able to survive until the third round, they shouldn\u2019t be completely useless. They\u2019re probably just a little scared. By letting them believe that a lighter was enough to help them escape and getting them to prepare adequately, perhaps they will be successful.\u201dYou Huo said: \u201cIt is also possible that they won\u2019t be successful.\u201dAfter saying that, for a long time he didn\u2019t hear a response.When he turned his head to look back, he saw Qin Jiu again looking at him. His eyes reflected the flames from the fire torch.\u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Qin Jiu retracted his gaze. He continued to look at the road ahead. After a moment, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that you sometimes like to carry heavy burdens and would even do that without saying anything.\u201dYou Huo wasn\u2019t very happy with his way of describing things. He gave a quiet snort.\u201cIf it is an examination centre with 100 people, I suspect you would be too busy to worry about anything else.\u201d Qin Jiu said.\u201cIs the pot calling the kettle black?\u201d You Huo glanced at him: \u201cAnd you do less than me? Were you not involved with all the things I\u2019ve done?\u201dQin Jiu let out a sound of affirmation but didn\u2019t say anything.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netAfter a few seconds, he suddenly added: \u201cThe motive is different.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cHow is it different?\u201d\u201cYou take the initiative.\u201d When Qin Jiu spoke, a cloud of white fog formed before his face: \u201cAs for me\u2026\u2026I just recalled for a moment; most of the time I was dragged into it.\u201dBullshit.You Huo didn\u2019t know where that bastard logic of his came from and couldn\u2019t help but say: \u201cAre you the one with amnesia or am I the one with it?\u201d\u201cI really did lose my memory before.\u201d Qin Jiu continued without any hesitation.As soon as he said that, he paused and added: \u201cAs for you, I\u2019m not sure.\u201dYou Huo was rendered speechless by him. A snort was emitted from his nose and soon everything turned silent again.Qin Jiu\u2019s gaze fell onto You Huo\u2019s shadow. He narrowed his eyes slightly.He was waiting for an answer.Just as he thought he wasn\u2019t going to get a response, You Huo suddenly said: \u201cI\u2019m really similar to you.\u201dQin Jiu\u2019s eyebrow raised. He looked back up at him.The flames painted a warm outline on his side profile, making him look slightly gentler than usual. It aided in hiding some of his cold and arrogant demeanour.You Huo said: \u201cThere are a few years that I no longer remember.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..What do you mean by not remembering?\u201d\u201cLiterally.\u201d You Huo said.\u201cThen when you said that you were in the military academy for how many years, were you fooling me?\u201dInvigilator 001 probed a little further.\u201cThat I still remember, but my impression of it isn\u2019t very deep.\u201d You Huo said. \u201cI have forgotten everything after that.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cAccidental injury during training.\u201dThat was the reason he was told when he woke up. He himself had also believed that for many years so it couldn\u2019t be considered as lying.You Huo internally thought this.Qin Jiu softly let out an \u2018oh\u2019.It was only at this moment that he realised that he felt relieved.You Huo still didn\u2019t know that he was invigilator A. Something like this actually made him\u2026\u2026..a little thankful.As for what he was thankful about, he didn\u2019t know. In any case, Mr. 001 pushed the phone in his pocket deeper inside.***The ice field was once again quiet.They both walked on carrying different thoughts in their minds.\u201cWait\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dSuddenly, a soft whisper could be heard.You Huo\u2019s heart suddenly skipped a beat. He turned and asked Qin Jiu: \u201cWhat?\u201dQin Jiu was also surprised. He almost pulled the phone out of his pocket: \u201cHuh? I didn\u2019t speak. Another auditory hallucination?\u201dAs soon as he said that, he realised that this time it wasn\u2019t You Huo\u2019s imagination.Because he heard it too.Several faint whispers were carried over by the wind. It was both vague and faint, as if there was something obscuring it.It should be what Shu Xue was describing.The two instantly stopped. They swept their fire torches around.After listening for a while, they came to a realisation. That sound didn\u2019t come with the wind. In fact, it came from below their feet\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In some places that were clearer, you could see the dark reefs buried deep down at the bottom. The others were covered in non-transparent, white web-like cracks.Under a certain area of ice that was covered with cracks, a man\u2019s pale face looked out. His pupils were so dilated, it occupied the majority of his eyes.He quietly looked at You Huo.\u201cAfter all that searching, turns out it was hiding here?\u201dQin Jiu\u2019s voice sounded from above his head. He straightforwardly gave that face a greeting: \u201cGood evening.\u201dHis \u2018good evening\u2019 was like bait thrown into a fishpond. More than a dozen more faces appeared.They all looked up at the same angle. Together, dozens of eyes stared at You Huo.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Jiu\u2019s lips began to move.\u201cYou shut up.\u201d You Huo said.Qin Jiu squinted his eyes and obediently kept his mouth shut.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dHis expression began to turn strange.But before he could think about it, Qin Jiu again pointed to the ground to motion for him to look down.As soon as You Huo lowered his gaze, his expression fell.His words \u201cyou shut up\u201d were like newly thrown out fish bait. An even larger group of faces appeared.It really was a group\u2026\u2026.Wherever the light from the fire torch illuminated, it was all faces.It was practically like what you would see at a big concert.Qin Jiu wasn\u2019t able to hold himself back. Glancing around, he commented: \u201cPretty popular. The response is good.\u201dYou Huo internally cursed: Your damn grandfather\u2019s response is good.He looked at Qin Jiu coldly.Qin Jiu again obediently shut his mouth. He even gestured with his index finger \u201cshhh\u201d.You Huo\u2019s expression turned even more strange.That\u2019s right, Qin Jiu had also teased him before.Things like the ridiculous nicknames \u201cMr. Humph\u201d and \u201cTop student\u201d and his teasing tone gave others the mistaken impression that they were \u201cclose teammates\u201d.It was like a lion who had eaten its fill and was lazing around for the moment. Using the tip of its claws, it would occasionally poke you, and then poke you again. Although it was a little sharp, it didn\u2019t hurt.That act of his was too confusing.It would make people forget about the lion\u2019s aggressiveness, lower their vigilance and gradually grow accustomed to it\u2026\u2026You Huo was a classic example of this.But he felt that he was probably standing at the midpoint between vigilance and becoming used to him. A certain balance was maintained.But now the other party had suddenly withdrawn their claws, leaving only the meat pad\u2026\u2026\u2026.Did he take the wrong medicine? Or did he have some other intentions?Standing above those human faces, You Huo fell into thought.He just had a small concern\u2026\u2026..If it went on like this, when Qin Jiu finds out who he had been teasing, would he hang himself in front of him with his leather rope?***\u201cHey! They\u2019re here, I found them!\u201d A shout rang in the distance. \u201cHEEEEYYYY\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dYou Huo quickly returned to his senses.Raising his eyes, he saw Qin Jiu looking away. It was as if he had just retracted his gaze from him.In the distance, someone was still shouting.Perhaps because he felt that it was impolite to shout \u201chey\u201d, he changed his words: \u201cBROTHER YOU\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013BROTHER QIN\u2014\u2014- WAIT FOR US. WE\u2019RE COMING OVER NOW!\u201dBased on the voice, it was probably Di Li.Behind him was a group of people all carrying fire torches. He had probably called out all the examinees inside the cave.This grey-haired classmate was quite good a projecting his voice. His shouts echoed throughout the deserted island.The name \u201cBrother Qin\u201d for a moment reminded Qin Jiu of Zhao Wentu.Please read this from kk translatesHe was stunned for a moment. He then said to the grey-haired boy who was bounding over: \u201cDon\u2019t come here, and don\u2019t make a sound.\u201dDi Li shouted: \u201cWHAAATT?\u2014\u2014\u2014-THE WIND IS TOO STRONG\u2014\u2014I CAN\u2019T HEAR\u2014\u2014\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was probably too late to shut up now.The eyes of the human faces under the eyes suddenly moved. They changed directions and swarmed towards Di Li.If it was just one or two faces, those quiet movements could easily be overlooked.But with such a large group, it was unavoidable. Di Li saw a large piece of white cloud-like mass float over and stop below his feet.He looked down\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201cMummy\u2014\u2014\u201dHe yelped and slipped. His butt crashed onto the ice floor.Right below him was the white, cloud-like mass.\u201cFuck\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe scrambled frantically over towards the two tall figures and was finally lifted up.\u201cWhat the fuck was mnmm\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dClassmate Di Li who had just managed to recover from the shock was in the middle of expressing his heartfelt feelings when two hands reached over the same time.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dOne covered his mouth and nose while the other covered his eyes and nose.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dDi Li who was struck twice was almost about to die from suffocation.As it turns out, being too agile wasn\u2019t always a good thing.This was especially the case when it comes to people who have the same reaction speeds\u2026\u2026You Huo covered Di Li while half of Qin Jiu\u2019s hand was pressed onto the back of his hand and the other half covered Di Li.Both froze.You Huo\u2019s hand that was pressed down moved slightly.Qin Jiu glanced at him before lowering his head and saying to the grey-haired classmate: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be chased by them, shut your mouth and don\u2019t make a noise.\u201dUnder them, a large mass of faces were waiting for the opportunity to strike.Qin Jiu thought a bit more and added: \u201cIt might also be better not to open your eyes for the time being.\u201dSeveral seconds passed after he said that. You Huo then felt the heat on the back of his hand disappear.Qin Jiu had removed his hand.***With one of the two hands removed, Di Li took a few deep breaths and obediently kept his eyes shut.He knew that those things were currently right underneath him.During moments like this, it was worse for those with vivid imaginations.Uncontrollable images constantly appeared in his mind\u2026..In his mind, all those human faces managed to get through the ice. Slowly starting at his toes, they would gradually chew all the way up.Chewing his calf, chewing his thigh, chewing his\u2026\u2026..Ahem\u2026\u2026\u2026You Huo gestured something at Qin Jiu and bent over to melt some of the ice using his fire torch.When he looked back, he saw the ace student silently guarding his groin.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dWhat is this kid thinking\u2026\u2026\u2026.?\u201cThat brat\u2019s sense of danger is pretty sharp.\u201d Qin Jiu broke off small pieces of ice and stone from the area melted by You Huo.Di Li endured for a moment but was unable to hold himself back. Using a voice as small as a mosquito, he asked: \u201cWhy can you guys talk?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cBecause we\u2019re not scared.\u201dDi Li again whispered: \u201cWhat are you guys doing now?\u201d\u201cWith more than thirty examinees all on their way here\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201d Qin Jiu glanced at the oncoming crowd, \u201cIn order to avoid having someone cry or wail, or even wet themselves, we\u2019re just preparing something small.\u201dAlright then.Wasn\u2019t it just human faces? Who hasn\u2019t seen them before? It\u2019s everywhere on the streets.Di Li mentally prepared himself, took a deep breath and opened his eyes.The first thing he heard were sounds of something cracking. He realised that those faces below him were trying to break through the ice.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe instantly jumped away. When he turned around, he saw You Huo kick off a rock about the size of a head and reach out to pick it up.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dDi Li felt that he appeared to have misunderstood what they meant by \u201csomething small\u201d.Although it was not what he had expected. Di Li quickly adapted.He followed You Huo and Qin Jiu. Making the most of the time before the rest of the examinees arrived, he proceeded to gather rocks both large and small.As expected, as soon as those examinees arrived, there were screams one after another.You Huo stood up: \u201cBe quiet!\u201dThe examinees reflexively stopped and stared at him wide-eyed.You Huo: \u201cTurn around.\u201dThey obediently did as they were directed.This time, they didn\u2019t need to wait for You Huo\u2019s instructions. They instinctively ran back towards the cave.The faces pressed against the ice floor were frozen for a moment. They then moved to chase after them.You Huo threw out a large stone in the opposite direction.Thuuuuud\u2014\u2014\u2014That stone smashed against the reef, emitting a loud sound before landing on the frozen floor.It rolled along the ice for a few more metres.The noise created by this was much louder than the examinee\u2019s slippery footsteps. The human faces quickly stepped on their brakes and turned around to chase after the rock.The three of them stepped back slightly. They slowly moved closer to the rest of the examinees.Seeing that those faces were about to return, Qin Jiu also threw out a rock.Thuuuuuud\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014It was another loud sound. Those faces all chased after the source of the sound.Di Li internally wondered if this was okay.He then threw out a small rock himself.Although the rock was small, it still made a loud sound when it made contact with the hard, icy surface.Unsurprisingly, those faces went after that sound.As they slowly made their way back to the cave, they threw stones in the opposite direction.Di Li watched the pale faces rush over to the east and then rush over to the west. He suddenly felt that he could now appreciate what it was like to bait a group of fish.***During the rest of the night, the atmosphere inside the cave had completely changed.Except for the two great masters You Huo and Qin Jiu who probably didn\u2019t even have the word \u201cscared\u201d in their dictionaries, the other examinees were vigilant and nervous. Not a single one of them were able to sleep.They not only didn\u2019t sleep; they also didn\u2019t dare make any noise. Even the mouths of the two snoring crew members were covered.They picked up a few twigs and roasted them using the fire. If they wanted to say something, they would use the burnt end of the twig to write on the ground.Because the cave was quiet and the temperature was just right, You Huo slept very well. When he opened his eyes again, the sun had already risen.As soon as he sat back up, he was met with a bunch of scrawls on the ground. He almost thought he had interrupted a demon summoning session.As for the examinees, they were all staring unblinkingly at him. Seeing how stiff they were, they had probably stared at him the entire night.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe ruffled his hair. Just as he was going to ask them what they were doing, he heard someone cough a few times followed by footsteps and rustling sounds.To make so much noise as soon as they woke up, it was clearly not an examinee.It was a crew member from the merchant ship. While yawning and stretching, he gave them his greetings.Except for a few simple vocabularies that were poorly pronounced, the language the crew member spoke with was all nonsense. None of the examinees understood. This persisted until the first officer appeared.The examinees quickly called him over and said quietly: \u201cFirst officer, tell your crew to speak more quietly.\u201dThe first officer was confused: \u201cWhy?\u201dPlease read this from kk translates\u201cShhhhh\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201d Di Li immediately gestured.He quietly recounted everything that happened late last night.The first officer who heard this fell silent for a moment. He then said: \u201cWe have stayed here for eight months but we haven\u2019t seen anything like that.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about that, but it appeared last night.\u201d Di Li said.As they spoke, a low voice that spoke in a different language interrupted.When they turned around and looked, they saw that it was the captain.The captain was both sick and injured. From the beginning until the end, he had constantly been in a state of unconsciousness and semi-consciousness. The strongest impression left by the captain was his various sleeping positions.Thanks to Wu Li\u2019s bandaging and treatment, and also with last night\u2019s filling dinner, the captain called Barentz was finally able to recover some of his energy.He stretched his limbs. While he tied his long hair behind his back, he nodded at the examinees.Then, he blew a whistle at the first officer.First office: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d The first officer said.The captain muttered a single word. \u201cWhat?\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe first officer used their language to explain.From the looks of it, he was probably recounting Di Li\u2019s words.But for some reason, upon hearing this news the captain was a little\u2026\u2026\u2026.happy?After a long time probing, everyone finally understood why the captain was happy. It was because of a legend.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: OHHH A legend~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It is an ancient, disaster-prone fleet that is also blessed by God.\u201cFor a long time, we have always withheld a strong belief \u2014\u2014\u2014 The goods return to the land, the humans return to the bottom of the sea.\u201d The first officer said.\u201cI understand that the goods return to land but what does it mean by humans returning to the bottom of the sea\u2026\u2026..?\u201d The good student Di Li asked sincerely. He truly felt the last half sounded very morbid.\u201cCrew members spend their entire life out at sea. If anything were to happen while delivering goods, wouldn\u2019t you be returning to the bottom of the sea?\u201d The first officer said.The captain and the first officer had worked together for a very long time so he had also learnt some broken Chinese \u2014\u2014 He could understand but his ability to speak was poor.Hearing the first officer\u2019s words, the captain next to him interjected with a single word: \u201cRoman.\u201dFirst officer: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dDi Li: \u201cHuh?\u201dThe captain waved his wounded arm around and added a few more gibberish.The first officer rolled his eyes to express his contempt towards his level of Chinese.He then translated: \u201cWhat the captain meant earlier was that sleeping eternally at sea was something sailors would regard as romantic; their dream. Though you may think that it\u2019s strange\u2026\u2026\u201dThe examinees thought about it for a moment and said: \u201cHmm\u2026\u2026It\u2019s actually understandable.\u201dThe first officer then said: \u201cOh right, I almost forgot. I heard earlier that you guys are adventurers? Then you probably think the same.\u201dDi Li: \u201cNo thanks, I\u2019m still young.\u201dThe captain laughed heartily.\u201cIn any case\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201d The first officer forcefully redirected the topic back and continued: \u201cThis belief has been carried down from generation to generation. Every time a ship goes out to sea to deliver goods, no matter where it is, no matter what happens, there would always be someone alive to deliver the goods to the destination. There was just one exception.\u201d\u201cThis place here.\u201d\u201cThis part of the sea here is one of the most dangerous places. When we deliver our goods using this route, we would often get lost halfway and get stuck here. We have lost many people here before and, in severe cases, no one would return alive.\u201dHearing this, the examinees could basically understand what was going on.Please read this from kk translatesThe so-called crew members being lost here generation after generation probably referred to the previous examinations. Every time there was an exam, a group of merchant ships would be stuck here.If the examinees were able to solve the question, then part of the crew would be able to return alive.If the examinees couldn\u2019t solve it, then all the crew would die from various issues until the bodies of the entire fleet are left behind on this deserted island.\u201cBut there were also several times when we were lucky and were favoured by God.\u201d The first officer said.\u201cAnd so, a legend was created by word of mouth from the survivors. Uh\u2026\u2026.The captain said that we no longer know who exactly it was that started it. In any case, the so-called legend mentioned the existence of messengers on the deserted island who symbolised life and hope. What you saw last night was probably those messengers. Some call them spirits but to us, they\u2019re angels.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe examinees expressions were filled with doubt. Internally, they commented: Your angels sure are terrifying.The captain again interjected energetically.He appeared to always be filled with energy. Even with his thin and emaciated body, he could still laugh out loud.Such a captain was indeed inspiring. Even the examinees relaxed a little.\u201cThe captain said that the words life and hope wasn\u2019t entirely accurate. He had done some research and learnt that the so-called hope referred to the ice melting. With the appearance of these messengers, it meant that the ice would melt, and we would soon be able to leave this place.\u201dThe first officer also rejoiced.But his personality was stoic by nature. After smiling, his expression turned stern again: \u201cThis is on the premise that everything goes well.\u201dThe captain was like a big monkey. He coaxed out the rest of the crew members from the cave.After a while, they all slipped back in.\u201cFor now, we didn\u2019t see the messengers. Maybe they don\u2019t appear during the day?\u201d\u201cBut there are several holes outside the cave. Maybe it was done by them?\u201dThe crew members chattered excitedly.The first officer was also excited, but he held himself back.The examinees who heard it however became nervous.\u201cWhat do you mean by that? Your angels came out?\u201d\u201cCame out to greet the sun and grant us hope.\u201d\u201cAlso, for the moment there hasn\u2019t been any changes to the ice. But Vanod said he felt the ice moving and he\u2019s an experienced sailor!\u201dThe crew started to dance.The examinees leaned against the wall in despair.The captain roughly combed through his dishevelled long hair with his fingers and plopped down before You Huo and Qin Jiu. The first officer had already accepted his fate to act as a translator.\u201cWith such good news, isn\u2019t it worth celebrating? You people seem very calm.\u201dThey had mistakenly thought that the examinees were also ship crew members in a similar predicament.You Huo didn\u2019t explain. Afterall, there was no point clarifying things with an NPC.\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to the melting of the ice, we knew about it last night. It\u2019s not a surprise.\u201d Qin Jiu said.The captain was surprised.\u201cHow did you know? Have you also heard of that legend?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cThat\u2019s not it. We heard it from a rabbit.\u201dCaptain: \u201cRabbit? A fairy tale? I like it. Where is the magical rabbit? Will I have the honour to meet it?\u201dQin Jiu brought over the roasted rabbit that was left in the corner.Captain: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe look he gave the rabbit was a little strange.So strange that, for a moment, he didn\u2019t seem like an NPC. It however only lasted a moment.Very quickly, he changed his expression and scratched his head before mumbling something.The first officer hesitated and translated: \u201cThe ending of this fairy tale is a little dark.\u201dYou Huo coldly inserted his own comment: \u201cNot as dark as the rabbit itself.\u201d\u201cYou guys are from different ships and now working together?\u201d The first officer asked.\u201cYou guys?\u201dThe first officer pointed at Qin Jiu and then at You Huo: \u201cYou two.\u201d\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d Qin Jiu glanced at You Huo and asked jokingly, \u201cWe don\u2019t look like we\u2019re from the same ship?\u201dThe first officer shook his head: \u201cYou look like captains. Two captains.\u201dQin Jiu pointed at You Huo: \u201cIs there such a rude captain like him?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dIn response to being mocked at his face, he snorted and stood up. Shaking off the numb feeling on his leg, he said to the captain: \u201cThe ice will melt tomorrow. We will send you home. If you have anything to say, say it now.\u201d\u201cTomorrow? Are you sure?\u201d\u201cMhn.\u201d\u201cThe captain instantly sprang up: \u201cThen we don\u2019t have much time!\u201dIf they were going back, there were many things they needed to prepare.The merchant ship was damaged, but it was enough if it could still sail and they could make do. If not, they would need to do some quick repairs.Please read this from kk translatesFuel and resources are also required to maintain life on the ship.Furthermore, the goods needed to be checked.Everyone quickly threw away the shadows left by their recent near-death experience and quickly scrambled up to help. This would also help them finish their exam as soon as possible.There\u2019s a hole on the side of the ship?Tear down the system\u2019s ship.Too many holes on the deck?Tear down the system\u2019s ship.The rudder is damaged by ice?Also tear down the system\u2019s ship.The advantage of Qin Jiu being an invigilator was most evident at this moment.He was knowledgeable about the majority of the rules and their associated punishments, so he knew that there was no additional penalty for the same rule violation. There was no difference between plucking out a strand of hair versus plucking everything out until it was completely bald.In any case, he and You Huo had already been punished for tearing down the system\u2019s ship. The fate of their ship was already predetermined.The examinees had a strong desire to live so their efficiency was very high.In about a days\u2019 time, two of the three merchant ships were repaired.At this rate, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for them to set sail tomorrow.The crew members calculated it and once again started dancing around the fire.But this celebration didn\u2019t last long.As soon as night came, the examinees quickly held them down and urged them to sleep to avoid luring the \u201cangel\u201d over.***At 11:55pm, the fire inside the cave was still burning strongly. It was eerily quiet.The excited crew members had already entered their dreams. The atmosphere inside the cave once again turned nervous.Chen Fei and Huang Rui were leaning with their backs against the stone wall.After hearing Qin Jiu\u2019s words, they didn\u2019t forget to make some preparations during the day while they were repairing the ships.Chen Fei had a fire torch in one hand, and a knife in another.The knife was something he had borrowed from one of the crew members. It came from the kitchen and was used to cut fruit and meat.Huang Rui, on the other hand, held two long metal hooks.He had considered taking the ships anchor. With it, it would be unparalleled in strength. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem knocking the monster out. But when he tried to lift it, he couldn\u2019t move it a single inch no matter how much effort he exhausted so he could only make do.Clutching tightly onto their weapons, the two felt a little safer.But their hands still couldn\u2019t help but tremble.11:57pm.The roasted rabbit hopped up and suddenly spoke up:\u30102 minutes and 15 seconds until midnight. Now recalculating today\u2019s score.\u3011\u3010Today, examinees could earn points from one area.\u3011\u30101. Repairing the two ships\u3011\u3010The scores are calculated as follows: \u3011\u3010A total of 6 points for repairing the merchant ship, including 3 points for preparing the materials and 3 points for repairing.\u3011On the stone wall, because everyone participated, everyone\u2019s score increased by the same amount.Every group earned 6 points.\u3010All points have now been allocated. Bonus points and penalties will now be applied.\u3011\u3010Today, examinees could be penalised for one area.\u3011\u30101. The crew did not eat three proper meals and went to sleep tired and hungry.\u3011The examinees were speechless.They didn\u2019t even mention eating yet they still had to carry the blame?But the system continued to chatter on:\u3010The score are as follows: \u3011\u3010As a hungry and tired state can affect the crew members ability to return home, each examinee is penalised 2 points.\u3011The scores once again changed on the stone wall.With all the adding and subtracting, the result was an increase in 4 points.But in fact, there were no changes to the ranking tonight.You Huo had hoped that his act of roasting the rabbit would allow him to be penalised but it seems the system had become smarter this time.Perhaps it was because roasting of the rabbit didn\u2019t affect its ability to speak, and because both had already been punished, it no longer wanted to punish these two annoying examinees lest their punishment devices get damaged too.So tonight, Chen Fei and Huang Rui were still ranked last.No one could save them.***On the cold and damp ceiling of the cave, the ugly octopus laid in wait.Once again, it was time for it to eat, but it wasn\u2019t happy at all.It was upset\u2026\u2026Its food last time was too mischevious and it resulted in it losing all its tentacles. It took it an entire day to regrow them back. If it was going to meet those two again\u2026..It would rather starve to death. At least that way it would still have some dignity left.It laid in wait for a long time before finally receiving the final result.It\u2019s dark, round eyes instantly lit up!This is great! The menu had changed tonight!It can finally have a filling meal!It cracked open its dark, hole-like mouth. Saliva constantly flowed out from this opening as it slowly extended its tentacles down.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: \u201cAngels\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The system had once again quietly sent the last ranked examinees over to the monster.Just like Qin Jiu and You Huo last ti\u2026\u2026..Huh?\u201cWhere\u2019s Brother You?\u201d Di Li was a little confused.He now regarded You Huo and Qin Jiu as something on par to cram study sessions and would stare at them all day long without averting his gaze.But now, one of them was gone.\u201cIsn\u2019t he her\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201dShu Xue turned around and pointed behind her only to find that there was only Qin Jiu there.There was an empty space on his left. Before the monster\u2019s arrival, You Huo was standing there but now not even a shadow was left behind.Shu Xue asked with surprise: \u201cWhere did he go? I heard him speak earlier.\u201dQin Jiu slowly wound a rope back up: \u201cThen did you hear what he said?\u201d\u201cI was looking at the scores so I didn\u2019t hear clearly\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dShe and Wu Li\u2019s ranking had been rising steadily so there was nothing to worry about, but she was very concerned about You Huo and Qin Jiu.These two gentlemen themselves didn\u2019t care so she had to do their share for them.Shu Xue tried to recall: \u201cI think I heard you two betting something.\u201d\u201cMhn.\u201d Qin Jiu said, \u201cWe made a bet.\u201dThey betted whether their ranking would drop.The winner could work out a little by doing some fishing, while the loser would need to deal with the boring aftermath.Qin Jiu won.But when the monster\u2019s tentacle reached down, someone cheated. Without a word, he stepped forward and was snatched away by the tentacle right in front of Qin Jiu\u2019s face.\u201cS-so what now? What\u2019s happening now?\u201d Someone asked.\u201cI\u2019m going to go find it to get someone back. You are free to do whatever.\u201d Qin Jiu strung the coiled rope on his arm and left the cave.Di Li was shocked for a moment. He then quickly rushed over to the entrance of the cave: \u201cAre you going to fight it? Can I go too\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201d***The system\u2019s punishment mechanism always comes into effect instantly.The moment the ugly octopus\u2019s tentacles that are lined with suction cups wrapped around the two final ranked examinees; the surroundings changed instantly.For a moment, it felt that the food tonight was a bit heavy.Something didn\u2019t seem right.But the next second, the tattered cabin was reflected on its round, beady eyes and it was welcomed with a familiar smell. It very quickly relaxed.It had returned to its usual dining place.It called this place the Cliffside Restaurant.Because the old ship had been trapped in the reef here for many years, layers upon layers of ice covered it.But the other side was suspended in the air, as if one day it would still break away from the ice and return to sea.But today the Cliffside Restaurant was a little messy\u2026\u2026.No, it was a complete chaos.It was all thanks to the efforts of its two food sources from last night.No matter where the octopus looked, anger surged.Carrying an \u2018if I don\u2019t see it, it\u2019s okay\u2019 mindset, it twisted around and proceeded to stuff its two new prey into its mouth.Just as it turned around, it noticed someone standing by the porthole.A familiar figure and familiar face. Who else could it be if not for You Huo?Please read this from kk translatesThe octopus\u2019s dark eyes widened in shock.It saw the headache inducing food from yesterday stand there as if he had just arrived\u2026\u2026..Next to him was a sack and in his hand was a knife.Those who didn\u2019t know what was going on would think he was here to get sashimi.The octopus\u2019s soft mouth trembled a few times. It intended to swallow its food first before fighting the person before it.But before it could do that, the food in its mouth suddenly moved.It felt a sharp, burning pain. It\u2019s tentacles instantly curled up.Soon after were two needle-like pricks. Its eye rolled over and it saw two metal hooks sticking out of its mouth pinning deeply into its flesh.Bang, bang, bang\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014There were several dull sounds coming from inside its mouth.The new food had suddenly started to struggle. They danced around wildly inside its mouth causing pain to the octopus.The octopus endured but eventually couldn\u2019t hold itself back. Once again, it vomited\u2026\u2026..Chen Fei and Huang Rui tumbled out onto the ground.They still hadn\u2019t realised that they had escaped and were still flailing around with their eyes closed.This continued until Chen Fei kicked Huang Rui causing the other to cry out. Only then did they stop.Chen Fei opened his eyes wide open. He and Huang Rui stared at each other. They were both still in a state of shock.They gasped for air for a long time before the thunderous roar nearby gradually subsided.\u201cMove aside!\u201d You Huo\u2019s voice suddenly sounded from behind.Perhaps it was the natural tone of his voice but at this moment his voice sounded extremely calm.Chen Fei and Huang Rui were startled out of their shocked state. They fumbled over to the side.By the time their backs met the wall and they could no longer back away any further, You Huo had already jumped over a staircase and started his fight with the octopus.\u201cWe\u2026\u2026\u2026.we\u2019re alive?\u201d Chen Fei was still very much confused.Huang Rui panted and said: \u201cAlive! Alive\u2026\u2026\u2026..It really worked!\u201dHuman\u2019s are very strange creatures. Once they\u2019ve managed to escape from the tiger\u2019s mouth, they no longer felt that the tiger itself was scary. They suddenly felt as if they had become stronger or, at least, they were stronger then they thought.Chen Fei watched You Huo\u2019s agile figure: \u201cAre we just going to sit here and watch?\u201dHuang Rui gripped tightly onto a metal hook: \u201cI have no pride anyway.\u201d\u201cMe too.\u201d\u201cGoing?\u201dChen Fei took a deep breath. Together, he and Huang Rui rushed out.***With one hand on the ground supporting him, You Huo took advantage of the tilted cabin floor to slip under various obstacles.The tentacles chasing after him weren\u2019t able to stop in time causing it to ram into those obstacles. Once those tentacles hit the wrong target, You Huo used that opportunity to cut it off.Slap\u2014\u2014-The severed tentacle fell to the ground. After writhing around a few times, it became lifeless.You Huo was used to fighting alone.With Qin Jiu not around this time, he suddenly realised how beneficial it was to have someone whose skills are par to his fight together with him.It would be much more efficient, and it would at least prevent him from spilling a sweat.But with just a giant octopus, it wasn\u2019t something he couldn\u2019t manage on his own.At most, it would just take a few more minutes.What surprised him was that the two examinees who were almost eaten were not completely scared witless and had even joined the battle.Compared to Qin Jiu, their agility, strength, speed, skill and physical fitness was not as good\u2026\u2026.They also couldn\u2019t take much damage and their minds weren\u2019t quick enough but they were still reasonably good teammates.You Huo glanced at the sack and internally made some calculations. He would leave after cutting off three more tentacles.But the ugly octopus appeared to have realised its predicament. It bolted away as fast as it could.As soon as he lifted the knife, the octopus tensed up it\u2019s tentacles and thrusted itself out through a hole in the bottom of the ship. Passing through the narrow cracks, it slipped out into the sea.\u201cIt ran away?\u201d Chen Fei stared at the hole not daring to move.Huang Rui walked over and carefully looked down. He reported: \u201cI don\u2019t see it anymore. It probably left.\u201d\u201cI guess so. It also left from there last time.\u201d You Huo kicked up the sack and tossed a few more tentacles in. After checking the weight, he appeared to look a little disappointed.Just as he was about to tie up the mouth of the sack, there was a soft squelching sound coming from the bottom of the ship.It was as if something had quietly attached itself to the ship.You Huo frowned. He looked up and said to Huang Rui: \u201cDon\u2019t stand there!\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesIt was almost too late when he said that.Thanks to Huang Rui\u2019s conditioned reflex to automatically obey You Huo\u2019s instructions, he didn\u2019t even have the time to think before his body instinctively fell backwards.The moment he fell, several thick tentacles pierced through the hole.Just a little more, and he would have been dragged out into the sea.Strange squeaking sounds resonated within the cabin. It was as if something slippery and soft was rubbing against something hard. It also seemed to be\u2026\u2026..some strange form of communication.You Huo didn\u2019t have a good feeling.Sure enough, the next second three identical octopuses emerged from the hole on the ground.Their tentacles swung around wildly, and it even carried whistling sounds as it flew past.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t think that a monster like this would go call its parents over after being defeated.One gigantic octopus was manageable and two would also be alright.But wasn\u2019t three a little too much???Those three ugly things were extremely large and plump. The old ship was already in a dire state and it couldn\u2019t contain those three things.You Huo kicked the sack over to the corner, grabbed the other two and pulled them behind the metal cabinet.After just a few creaks, the deck above them finally succumbed. In an instant, it broke open.***Not far away, on the ice field.With Di Li and the others insisting on following, Qin Jiu didn\u2019t stop them.And so, a large group of examinees hurried over the ice while trying their utmost best to avoid making too much noise in fear that the \u201cangels\u201d under the ice would be lured over.\u201cAre we there yet? How far is it?\u201d Di Li who did his best keeping up with Qin Jiu asked in a quiet voice.As soon as the last of his words were spoken, loud explosions could be heard in the distance. Soon afterwards, fleshy white tentacles appeared. They swung around wildly, smashing everything in sight.Alright then.With all this ruckus, even without Qin Jiu answering, everyone knew the answer.Di Li took in those giant tentacles and swallowed nervously: \u201cI\u2026\u2026..Fuck\u2026\u2026It doesn\u2019t seem to be just one?! That octopus can reproduce?\u201dQin Jiu\u2019s looked over in the distance. He didn\u2019t answer.The next moment, he suddenly chuckled.Di Li internally wondered if he had gone mad.But before he could suppress those thoughts, Qin Jiu turned around and said to everyone: \u201cExcuse me.\u201dEveryone had grown used to him acting roguishly the past few days. With him suddenly saying \u2018excuse me\u2019, for a moment they couldn\u2019t get used to it.\u201cNo, no, no. Don\u2019t say excuse me. If there\u2019s anything we can do, please tell us.\u201dThey said in a very small voice.Qin Jiu: \u201cShout a few times.\u201dEveryone: \u201c???\u201dHuh?With all those angels watching underground, you\u2019re getting who to shout a few times?Di Li was so dumbfounded; he almost fell to his knees.But his brain worked quickly. After standing there frozen for a few seconds, he came to understand Qin Jiu\u2019s intention.And so, with his two hands forming a projecting horn in front of his mouth, he let out a howl.Just howling out wasn\u2019t enough, he even jumped on the ice a few times.The next second, hundreds of small pale faces raced over.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026***In the cabin, the three giant octopuses were still rampaging around.Probably because it was bullied earlier, it wanted to vent and show off its power now that it had the upper hand.The sounds of smashing and collisions were endless. The whistling of the air as the tentacles flew by was extremely terrifying.In addition to this, there was also something else going on in the background.It was the sound of the ice below them cracking.Unfortunately, the octopuses were too excited and were completely unaware of this.By the time it was done showing off its power and was ready to attack, human voices suddenly filled the half-destroyed ship.The three octopuses froze for a moment. They then looked back impatiently.At this moment, they saw thirty plus examinees rushing over.But that wasn\u2019t the main issue. The main issue was behind them\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Numerous pale human faces swarmed over. Like a white wall of wind, it rushed over like a tsunami.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe octopuses didn\u2019t know what sin it had committed.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: It\u2019s hard being a villain these days\u2026..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The hunter from the first exam is actually called Hunter A. Not that it\u2019s important\u2026..but I just wanted to keep it as close as possible to the raws.You Seem DeliciousChapter 60: Turning SharplyThis examination centre had been around for a long time.If you calculated it based on the time in reality, it had existed for many years. If you based it on the time in here, it could be considered a century-old island.For almost a century, the octopuses had based their lair here in this corner of the island.From one to two and then it became a family of three.Of course, they also knew about the existence of those pale faces under the ice. They not only knew about it, they have also personally witnessed them grow larger and larger in size, eventually becoming an existence on the island that could not be provoked.Every time those faces wandered around at night, that sight was truly terrible\u2026\u2026.Due to various reasons, they didn\u2019t want to interact with those pale faces.Fortunately, their range of activities were different.While they ate in the ship cabin, those faces were on shore chasing the examinees. While they returned to the sea after eating, those faces were still on shore chasing the examinees.Well water does not interfere with river water. (KKnotes: Basically, everyone minds their own business.)They had thought that life on the island would always be like this.They had never expected\u2026\u2026..that something like this would happen.The three octopuses were frozen in place.They froze for a few seconds and quickly turned to flee into the sea.But at this moment, something clanged\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Inside the cabin, You Huo slammed his foot against the metal cabinet.The rusty mass collapsed and accurately fell over the hole on the ground.And outside the cabin, with one hand supporting himself using the railing, Qin Jiu jumped in and landed in front of You Huo. In his hands, he carried a bundle of rope.You Huo naturally thought the rope was brought to tie up the octopuses and internally thought their tacit understanding of each other was quite alright. Although it was a bigger commotion than he had anticipated, the aftermath was dealt with excellently.Contrary to his beliefs, after Qin Jiu stood back up, he gently threw the pre-prepared rope around You Huo.The great master was caught off-guard. For a moment, he was stunned.All the compliments and praises instantly evaporated.What cooperation? What bullshit tacit understanding?It wasn\u2019t until Qin Jiu tightened the knot around his arms that he was able to ask incredulously: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t tell?\u201d Qin Jiu looped the remainder of the rope around his hand: \u201cI travelled through mountains and valleys to catch a cheater. Along the way, I also tricked a few thugs over.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d The cheater pursed his lips and fell silent for a few seconds: \u201cCan\u2019t you prioritise?\u201dQin Jiu turned around and looked behind him\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Thirty plus examinees dropped in one by one like dumplings. All sorts of exclamations and cries of pain were let out as they fell in.And above them, the system\u2019s punishment device and the examination subject had already started to fight\u2026\u2026..The pale-faced army greeted the ugly octopuses directly.At that moment, the wind suddenly became stronger and howling sounds came from all directions.For some reason, the pale faces had forgotten about the examinees they were pursing and seemed to possess unimaginably strong aggressiveness towards those three octopuses.With their necks outstretched, in a blink of an eye they had engulfed the octopuses into a white whirlwind.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netIt was the first time the examinees saw such violent expressions on those pale faces. Terrified, they quickly retreated into a corner of the cabin.Qin Jiu turned back and said to You Huo while pointing behind him: \u201cI went and found some thugs first before coming to get you. I think I prioritised well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dYou Huo had no words to say in response to that.The upper deck of this tattered ship was already broken off. Their view outside was unobstructed.Those faces had already lifted the octopuses half into the air. Ice fragments and seawater splattered in all directions, hitting the interior of the cabin in successive waves.The wooden floor pitter and pattered like it was raining.None of the examinees dared to look out.The diligent classmate Di Li found a great spot for himself. Crouching next to Qin Jiu and behind a wooden box, he pretended that it helped with blocking some of the ice and water.He looked out from behind the wooden box, looked at Qin Jiu, looked at the rope and then looked at You Huo before asking curiously: \u201cBrother Qin, what is the ropes purpose? I can\u2019t keep up this time.\u201dYou Huo said: \u201cA madman\u2019s purpose.\u201dQin Jiu laughed seemingly in silent agreement.You Huo moved to unbind himself. As he undid the rope, he said to Qin Jiu: \u201cDidn\u2019t you bring along medicine? You should take some before you leave.\u201dDi Li finally realised how stupid his question was. He quietly shrank back.As he shrank away, he heard Qin Jiu answer unhurriedly: \u201cThere\u2019s none left. All used by the crew.\u201dDi Li: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe fuck? You can answer like that?Di Li retracted the rest of his head and decided to act like he didn\u2019t exist\u2026\u2026\u2026***That night, the one thing the examinees regretted the most was the fact that they had lost their fire torches as they ran over.Those small pale faces were extremely aggressive, but the giant octopuses were also not something easy to deal with.The two parties struggled with each other for very long time.From the shore to the sea and then from the sea back to the shore, they moved back and forth over the bare and tattered ship.It was surprising that there was no breaks in the frozen sea with all this commotion.Some of the examinees who were on the braver side took a quick look and even doubted whether tomorrow\u2026\u2026.Oh, that\u2019s not right. It\u2019s today now. They doubted whether the ice would melt today.During the remainder of that period, the examinees shivered in the cold.Those small pale faces were at a disadvantage because they didn\u2019t have as many arms as the octopuses. This one battle lasted all night.It wasn\u2019t until the horizon in the distance began to turn grey and the sky brightened up that the small pale faces gradually dissipated along with the morning mist.The exhausted octopuses laid sprawled across the reef, like seafood waiting to be dried.With them no longer moving, the examinees could now take action.***Three semi-unconscious giant octopuses suddenly felt suffocated.When they opened their eyes, they felt pain on their faces.It was especially painful.It was like it was pulled hard by someone and then it snapped back like a rubber band.Soon they realised\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026It really was like that!They were actually tied up and bound against a nearby reef.If it was just their tentacles tied up to prevent it from being thrown around, it wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal because they could still detach it on their own accord and escape.But with prior experience, this time the examinees also tied down their faces.Missing limbs could be regenerated but regenerating a missing head was impossible.As they baked under the sun and gradually dried out, anger and despair filled their hearts.After all that time on this deserted island, this was their first time losing so much dignity\u2026\u2026\u2026.But this was nothing. Some demonic examinees were still capable of making them lose even more dignity\u2014\u2014\u2014-Even after the sky finally brightened, nothing happened to the surface of the sea.Letting the octopuses air dry outside, the examinees proceeded to repair the last merchant ship.Perhaps it was because of their anxiousness, everyone\u2019s efficiency was very high. In less than two hours, everything was completely repaired.Waiting was always the most difficult.They couldn\u2019t sit still and eventually began to find something to do.The sun changed position. The area where the octopuses were drying were now under some shade. With consensus from the rest of the examinees, a group of ten examinees moved to drag the octopuses onto the ice.Their soft faces scraped against the ragged reefs the entire time until they reached the shore.The front of the merchant ships were able to hold the most weight, so the examinees decided to lift the octopuses onto the ships and tie it to the side facing the sun.As they tied the last knot, Captain Barentz looked out from inside the cave.He gestured and shouted something.The first officer also looked out. Using his louder voice, he translated: \u201cWHAT ARE YOU DOING\u2014\u2014\u2013?\u201dThe octopuses deformed faces were so disgusting, it was blinding. You Huo removed his eyes from it like he would go blind if he looked at them a second longer.He was the first one to return to the cave.The first officer pointed to the ship and asked again: \u201cThe captain asked what you\u2019re doing with his ship. What have you tied to it?\u201d\u201cReserve food. Prepared it for you.\u201dThe captain immediately became happy. He shielded the sun and looked over. He recognised those tentacles as the ones they ate last night.First officer: \u201cThe captain gives you his thanks. It looks delicious. He\u2019s currently extremely hungry.\u201dAs soon as he said that, the first officer\u2019s stomach also made a few sounds.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netHe silently froze. The captain next to him smacked his back and laughed loudly.All the crew there were extremely hungry but, now that they were about to set sail, they were too excited to calm down and eat.The octopuses were still hanging from the side of the ships with not a shred of dignity left. They waited there for their final sentence.\u2026\u2026\u2026The sun slowly began to sink. You Huo leaned against the entrance of the cave.Soft rustling sounds were heard nearby. He glanced over. It was Qin Jiu.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Qin Jiu looked out with one hand raised to support himself against the cave entrance.You Huo indicated with his chin: \u201cWaiting to see when the ice will melt.\u201d\u201cIn a hurry?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d You Huo said: \u201cA few hours earlier or a few hours later makes no difference.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still a little different.\u201d Qin Jiu also leaned against the wall outside, \u201cIf it only melts when night comes, it might attract those human faces over. At that time, it\u2019s going to be rowdy again.\u201dThose words of his came true.The froze surface was like an old granny\u2019s mouth. It stubbornly didn\u2019t let a single crack escape.They waited until the sky darkened and then waited until it was night. When it finally reached late at night, they heard a small sound amidst the silence.\u201cIt\u2019s melting!\u201d Several of the older crew members jumped to their feet.The next moment, all the crew members had rushed out of the cave.It was the soft sound of ice breaking.The first was soft. The second was also soft. But with all the ice breaking at the same time, the effect was rather terrifying.The examinees hurried out carrying their weapons and fire torches and were instantly greeted with deafening sounds.Although no one dared to look below them, they knew very well that those faces were coming their way.Perhaps the next second they would break through the ice and rush over like a tsunami, engulfing everyone in a whirlwind of pale faces.Although they haven\u2019t experienced it personally, they have witnessed it happen to the three octopuses.And now, they were blindfolded and tied to the ship. Although they were unable to see anything, they still subconsciously writhed their tentacles around in attempt to avoid being beaten up a second time.If those giant octopuses are so scared, it wasn\u2019t surprising for a small human to fear those facestoo\u2026\u2026\u2026But because they needed to help escort the merchant ships out, the examinees could only remain on the ship.A crew member threw down a rope ladder. One by one, they climbed up onto the ship. As soon as they reached the deck, the white all of wind came.Roars came one after another. It sounded like it was coming from all directions. The faces desperately stretched their necks out searching for their target.Despite such ferocity, their expressions didn\u2019t change. The contrast between their expression and the actions conversely made it even more terrifying.\u201cFUUUCKK! Hurry up! Didn\u2019t you say that everything is ready? Why aren\u2019t we leaving?!\u201d\u201cHurry and go!\u201d\u201cPull the sail! PULL THE SAIL\u2014\u2014-\u201dThe wall of wind composed of pale faces was rapidly approaching the ship.\u201cQuick! Hurry up captaaain! If we don\u2019t leave now, we\u2019re going to die!!\u201dShouts from the ship and roars from the wind intermingled.As they shouted, the helmsman turned the wheel completely. The mended sails instantly filled with wind.The moment those pale faces reached the shore, the merchant ship had just barely left.A trace of disappointment was evident on those stiff faces.This is great. Although they still felt a little uneasy\u2026\u2026but it\u2019s finally over.The captain thought this.He held a rusted pocket watch in his hand. He repeatedly opened and closed the lid. Accompanied with his actions were small clicking sounds.You Huo glanced at the small portrait on the pocket watch through the corner of his eyes.Perhaps it was due to his instincts, but his eyelid suddenly started to twitch.At the same time, Qin Jiu next to him murmured: \u201cNot good.\u201dAs soon as he finished saying that, the three ships which had just left the shore suddenly turned around. After a complete 180 turn, it returned back to its original place.Soon afterwards, a music box like object on the ship suddenly spoke:\u3010Detected that return conditions were not completely met.\u3011Examinees: \u201c?\u201d\u3010The merchant ships have all returned to shore. This melting period will end in five seconds.\u3011Examinees: \u201c???\u201d\u3010Counting down: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.\u3011\u3010Following the end of this melting period, there will not be one in the near future.\u3011\u3010We hope the examinees can send the merchants home soon and achieve good results.\u3011The situation had suddenly changed.Before the examinees were able to register this announcement, the sea was once again frozen.It didn\u2019t even give them time to digest what was happening!And it asked them to achieve good results\u2026\u2026\u2026.Bastard.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Oh no, what could they have overlooked?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He screamed and fearfully scrambled away.\u201cEveryone into the cabins!\u201d The captain stood on a post used for securing ropes and shouted this order.The wind from the wall of faces was so fierce, he couldn\u2019t open his eyes.After shouting this order, he was pulled down. All the crew members jumped into the cabin as they were trained.As most of the people fled in panic, You Huo on the other hand moved closer.He took a few steps towards the white wall of faces and seemed to want to check something\u2026\u2026.\u201cStop looking! You don\u2019t want to live anymore?!\u201d The first officer shouted in Chinese and roughly yanked him away: \u201cHurry and get in!\u201dIn a blink of an eye, the decks of the three merchant ships were emptied. Everyone had entered the ships\u2019 cabins.A crew member immediately slammed the trapdoor shut and tied it shut with a rope before collapsing onto the stairs, his face void of colour.The first officer leaned against the rope and panted for a while. He had yet recovered from the terror.\u201cWhat was that?\u201d He asked: \u201cIt was too chaotic earlier. I was too busy pushing people in and didn\u2019t have the chance to look closely.\u201dDi Li was also leaning on the same rope. He said breathlessly: \u201cYour angel. Probably here to see you off.\u201dFirst officer: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe finally began to doubt the authenticity of the legend. He angrily shouted: \u201cCaptain\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dThe captain was almost out of air from shouting earlier. At this moment, he was fanning himself with his hat. He also looked like he was quite frightened by those faces and wasn\u2019t in a very good state.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d The captain asked.The first officer said: \u201cWhere on earth did you hear a legend like that? It\u2019s quite different from reality?\u201dThe captain snorted. He didn\u2019t have a good expression: \u201cDo legends need to be verified first so that they can be considered legends?\u201dDi Li didn\u2019t understand their language, but he could guess based on their expressions.He pondered and asked the first officer: \u201cCan you ask your captain if the legend also mentioned anything else? Anything more detailed?\u201dHe knew very well that the clues these NPCs held were probably not accurate and probably came with the guise of legends, notes, maps, last words and the like.It didn\u2019t matter if it was a little inaccurate. Just having information was enough.Di Li desperately clung to this hopeful thought of his.The first officer asked before turning around and explaining in Chinese: \u201cI asked. There\u2019s nothing else. The legend was from a long time ago, so the content is a little vague now. It was just those same sentences. The captain already told you everything that he knew.\u201dDi Li sighed. He scratched his head in frustration.The first officer said: \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I made you happy for no reason.\u201dNot only the examinees, this was true to the crew members too.They had fully believed that they could leave this deserted island, and they didn\u2019t expect to be sent back again at such a critical moment.The mood inside the cabin was down. A cloud of gloom covered the heads of everyone there.Di Li calculated in disbelief with his fingers: \u201cAll three merchant ships were repaired.\u201d\u201cThe precious goods were also counted, and we have confirmed that nothing was missing.\u201d\u201cFood; that\u2019s tied up to the ship and it can even regenerate itself so it should last all three ships for a long time.\u201d\u201cAs for wood used for heating, there\u2019s plenty of that too. If they used it sparingly, it can last a while.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.What else are we missing? We\u2019re not missing anything.\u201dWu Li\u2019s white coat was actually very thin. She huddled together with Shu Xue to keep warm.She sat on the steps and rubbed her arms for a while before rummaging through her pocket and pulling out a recording pen.\u201cYou even carry this around with you?\u201d Shu Xue was a little surprised.\u201cI have meetings often. Work requirement.\u201d Wu Li fiddled with the recording pen and played a short recording.\u3010Winter of 1597. Three Dutch ships were trapped in the frozen sea as it tried to reach Russia, so they temporarily docked on a nameless island and waited for the long winter to pass. This is currently the eighth month of their stay here. There are still 15 days until the end of winter and the ice melting. Please help all the crew members safely sail off.\u3011Everyone froze for a moment.This was the original question played by the system on their first day here.Hearing it again, it sounded a little unfamiliar.Human memories are very strange; it would always subconsciously grasp the key point. And the key point here that they\u2019ve grasped onto was \u201chelping the merchant ship sail off\u201d.Other words and descriptors were considered as minor details and automatically ignored.Now that they were listening to it again, Brother Li\u2019s occupational disease played up and he immediately remarked: \u201cAll the crew members\u2026\u2026\u201dHe placed emphasis on the word \u201call\u201d.Please read this from kk translatesDi Li moved his neck off the rope: \u201cOh yeah\u2026\u2026..That\u2019s right! All! Strictly speaking, the crew here can\u2019t be considered as \u2018all\u2019. We still need to include the eight who have died!\u201dAs they became excited, the pale faces outside seemed to also be excited.The wind shook the ship around violently.Everyone shrank back and lowered their voices back down.\u201cThen what do we do?\u201d\u201cHide out here for a bit first. When the angels are gone, we\u2019ll go find the rest of the crew.\u201dThey previously feared when night came to this deserted island because, every night, someone would be sent to become the octopus\u2019s dinner.Now that the octopus had become their food, the threatening existence was gone. Staying another night was no longer a problem.While they rejoiced, You Huo didn\u2019t join in.He had borrowed the pocket watch from the captain and was looking at the portrait inside.This pocket watch was actually something he brought back.He had picked it up in the cabin were the octopuses were and gave it to the first officer because he thought the design was similar to the one he had. Unexpectedly, it had ended up in the captain\u2019s possession.But he wasn\u2019t concerned about this. He was concerned about the man in the portrait.It was a half-body portrait of a man with long hair. With thick eyebrows, a high nose bridge and his lips slightly arched downwards, he looked a little serious.In particular, this man had a small mole just above his lips, right in the centre. There was also a similar one above his left eyebrow.Lifelike portraits like these could be somewhat different from reality, but these two moles wouldn\u2019t be.The moment he saw him, You Huo was reminded of someone.No, to be more precise, it was a face\u2014\u2014-It was the first face he saw under the ice when he and Qin Jiu first toured the island.That pale face looked up at him for a very long time and he clearly remembered that the face had moles in the exact same position. With the face also quite similar to the portrait here, he felt that it was probably the same person.You Huo asked the captain: \u201cWho is this?\u201dThe captain\u2019s usual cheerful expression disappeared. He lowered his eyes as he received the pocket watch and he rubbed his thumb over the portrait.After a moment, he looked back up and returned to his usual relaxed expression: \u201cMijn vader\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe turned around and called the first officer over.The first officer translated: \u201cThis is the captain\u2019s father, and also the captain of the previous merchant fleet.\u201dHis words attracted the attention of the other examinees.After he was done speaking, everyone learnt that there had been many captains before this over the past century. Barentz\u2019s father was also one of them.He had joined the fleet at 18 years of age and, because of his skills and strict personality, he became the captain of a fleet at 23 years of age. Travelling back and forth through various heavy storms and difficult environments, he managed to successfully deliver countless goods.At the age of 29, he and his fleet encountered a storm and died at sea.At that time, Captain Barentz had just turned 4.The blood of a sailor was still in Barentz\u2019s bones. He was fated to also go out to sea when he turned of age.The year he became a captain, he was also 23 years old, just like his father.Over all these years, he would sometimes think that perhaps one day he could find traces left by his father at sea.But he never found it. It was like this until today, until just now\u2026\u2026\u2026When he boarded the ship, he saw the metal box and the pocket watch amongst their belongings. It resembled the ones in in his memory.After thirty years, he finally achieved his wish.***Despite knowing that these people are only subjects of the question, the examinees still felt a little emotional.They quietly digested this information and suddenly noticed a problem.\u201cSo those fa\u2014\u2014\u201d Di Li smacked his lips and changed his words: \u201cThose outside\u2026..they\u2019re the crew members who had died out here in the past? They\u2019re all from the merchant ships?\u201d\u201cIt should be\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cThen those bones in that ship?\u201dEveryone looked at each other.\u201cProbably belonged to crew members and previous examinees.\u201dOver all these years, batches after batches of crew members were stranded on this deserted island.Those three octopuses would eat examinees when there were examinees and if they didn\u2019t have examinees, they would eat the crew members. This continued day after day and the pile of bones in the old cabin gradually grew larger and larger.No wonder those pale faces were so angry when they saw those octopuses\u2026\u2026.Their lives were taken by them.If they were still alive, they would be someone\u2019s parents, someone\u2019s child, someone\u2019s lover, someone\u2019s home\u2026\u2026\u2026.***You Huo looked around.There was someone missing in the cabin. It actually felt a little strange.Taking advantage of the confusion, he opened the trap door.The wind formed by the human faces were filled with water vapour. It shrouded the merchant ship like a large mass of fog.And before them stood the person You Huo was looking for.The trap door creaked.Qin Jiu looked back.\u201cYou didn\u2019t enter the cabin?\u201d You Huo hopped onto the deck.Qin Jiu froze for a moment before squinting his eyes: \u201cYou specially came out to find me?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d You Huo walked over to the bow of the ship and said, \u201cSuddenly thought of something. Came to confirm it.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cConfirming their aggressiveness.\u201d You Huo pointed at the pale faces.Since those small pale faces used to be crew members and examinees, then perhaps\u2026\u2026..they are not malicious.Legend has it that they would appear when the ice melts. Perhaps it was just their way of reminding those leaving not to forget them, not to leave them behind\u2026\u2026..You Huo had intended on confirming this but unexpectedly Qin Jiu was a step ahead of him.Please read this from kk translatesBut this Mr. 001 didn\u2019t hear about the story behind the pale faces.He said: \u201cI was just curious. If I tried to force my way through, how much harm could they cause? So I stayed behind.\u201dYou Huo remained silent. He wasn\u2019t surprised.Qin Jiu raised his left hand. There was a small cut on his palm. It was long, but not deep.\u201cAt first it was quite fierce, but now it has calmed down.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI could almost guess their intentions so I said to them that we would take them away once they stop.\u201dAnd so\u2026\u2026\u2026.those pale faces stopped in mid-air, and became a large, floating cloud.***It didn\u2019t take long for the other examinees and crew members to notice this. They slowly pulled open the trap door and stuck their heads out before letting out a long sigh of relief.Although they knew the problem, solving it was another issue.Led by the first officer, they ran across the deserted island in search of the eight buried crew members. They then spend another night melting them away from the ice and removing the old ship filled with bones from the reef.Year after year, all the bones had mixed together. One could no longer tell which belonged to who.But at least, they were all there. Not a single one was lost.The crew threw down a long rope. Everyone tied the old ship tightly behind the merchant ship.The sky in the distance began to brighten. Everything was ready.The more experienced crew members looked in the distance for a moment and said: \u201cIt\u2019s a rare sunny day. We can depart any time.\u201dEveryone was excited. They all quickly climbed onto the deck.But after a while, they all became depressed\u2026..\u201cThe system personally said that the ice wouldn\u2019t melt in the near future. The near future is too general. How would we know how long it would take\u2026\u2026.\u201d Di Li had become a little braver and was now able to complain and curse out the system.After he cursed a few times, Qin Jiu interrupted: \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible if we want to leave now.\u201dDi Li\u2019s eyes brightened: \u201cHuh???\u201dYou Huo glanced at him and asked: \u201cI don\u2019t mind but are you sure you can continue playing around like this? Any more and they will no longer let you off.\u201dQin Jiu laughed. He didn\u2019t care.Di Li watched them speak in riddles. He was utterly confused.After a while You Huo and Qin Jiu undid the rope around the octopus\u2019s tentacles, leaving only the part tied around their faces.With the tentacles regaining freedom, it immediately started to dance around wildly. Several times, it almost hit the sails, startling the people present.But the two great masters were very satisfied.They then borrowed a quill from the captain\u2026\u2026.Di Li walked over carefully and saw You Huo randomly pick up a clean wooden board and write four numbers onto it.922 154 021 078***In the small white invigilator\u2019s ship, four examinees suddenly received a request for help from an examinee.078 almost died from suffocation the moment he saw the name.021 was the complete opposite, but she didn\u2019t show it.922\u2019s expression was very strange.Only 154 said: \u201cHe\u2019s actually asking for help?\u201d078 suddenly remembered something: \u201cOh right! Wasn\u2019t there a message from the system before? They have missed the melting period and are probably in a difficult position?\u201dYou Huo\u2019s in a difficult position!This sentence made the invigilators pleased.Without a word, 078 turned the ship and headed for the deserted island.Twenty minutes later, the small white ship could be seen in the distance.It was still a few dozens of metres away from the island. All four invigilators were standing on the deck.They rearranged their clothes and intended to reaffirm their authority but when they looked out, they were met with the sight of countless tentacles flying around in front of the three merchant ships.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhat the hell is this?!The invigilators instantly turned their heels and rushed back into the cabin without looking back.078 rushed to the wheel and sharply turned it around.Unfortunately, no matter how fast his reaction was, there was still some delay.The invigilator\u2019s small white ship continued forward a few dozens of meters and gently brushed against the shore. Any place the ship touched; the frozen ice automatically melted.On the merchant ship, the captain shouted his commands and the helmsman immediately turned wheel of the ship.Taking advantage of the wind from the pale faces, the sails instantly billowed out.The strong wind blew. The sea water swelled.Three merchant ships carrying dancing octopus tentacles chased after the invigilator\u2019s ship.Wherever the invigilator\u2019s ship passed, nothing obstructed its path.***Seeing You Huo and Qin Jiu on the deck, the first officer called the captain.\u201cYou\u2019re here? Give me your address. I don\u2019t know about you, but I now regard you two as friends. If there is a chance, I\u2019ll write you a letter.\u201dSaid the captain.At that moment, he looked nothing like an NPC. Instead, he looked just like a living human.A living human who lived in a certain country, in a certain town like everyone else.You Huo took the pen, raised his hand and wrote an N. He froze.He had lived in many places but none of them started with an N. For some reason, he had subconsciously written that.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d The first officer asked: \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you\u2019re not willing.\u201dYou Huo shook his head. He crossed out the N character and wrote Yu Wen\u2019s address: \u201cSend it here.\u201dThe first officer then gave the pen to Qin Jiu.Qin Jiu didn\u2019t accept it.He looked down at You Huo\u2019s writing and said: \u201cI can\u2019t receive it.\u201dEven You Huo was stunned for a moment.Qin Jiu then laughed. He pointed at You Huo and said to the first officer: \u201cWhen I can someday, I\u2019ll get your address from him.\u201dThe captain and first officer nodded in understanding.\u2026\u2026\u2026..Behind them, an old soggy ship followed.It had been stranded for many years and was tattered beyond repair. Now, with its cabin filled with bones, it once again rode the waves.At long last, the sun filtering down ahead directed its way as it was forcibly pulled along.White fog closely followed.

The examinees however didn\u2019t remain on the ship for long.Just ahead, dark clouds suddenly appeared.The captain said that once they passed through those dark clouds, they would be getting closer to the mainland.And so, the three merchant ships taking along the old wrecked ship entered those dark clouds\u2026\u2026\u2026.They went through, but the examinees didn\u2019t.The examinees immediately felt cold, like there were suddenly soaked with ice water.In a blink of an eye, the scenery before them changed.The merchant ship disappeared with the dark clouds. They had returned to the deserted frozen wasteland.The moment they saw the stone cave, they fell into despair.\u201cAfter working so hard to get away, why are we back again?!\u201d Someone complained loudly.\u201cOtherwise? Did you want to go home with the merchants?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026That\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cI thought we would go back to the rest stop after going through those dark clouds.\u201d\u201cYou wish. I didn\u2019t think we would return to the rest area, but I also didn\u2019t think we would return back here. I\u2019m traumatised by this place. Just the sight of this stone cave makes me feel suffocated\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cMe too. So why are we sent back here?\u201d\u201cThe points haven\u2019t been calculated yet?\u201d Di Li suddenly suggested.All the discussions instantly stopped.They had become too immersed with helping the merchants that they had forgotten that they were in the middle of an exam. They had forgotten something so important.And only Di Li who had been calculating points for more than ten years would remember something like this.Sure enough, as soon as he said that, a familiar voice sounded.Strictly speaking, that voice wasn\u2019t unpleasant. In fact, it actually sounded pretty good.But with its monotonous tone and along with the nature of the contents it said, it made it difficult for others to like it.\u3010All merchants have returned. The examinees have completed their paper. The examination has ended.\u3011\u3010Now finalising the rewards and penalties.\u3011The examinees froze for a moment before slithering into the cave.A familiar stone wall, familiar ranks.The only difference was that there were no fires around to heat up the cave nor were there snoring crew members.They had clearly only just sent them off, but it felt like a century had passed.\u3010This examination followed the participation model. The questions are open-ended and there are opportunities for bonus points and point deductions throughout. All the points that were earned prior to this had been calculated and published in real time. It is now time for the final calculations.\u3011\u3010The examinees in total triggered four areas.\u3011\u30101. Repairing the last merchant ship.\u3011\u30102. Providing sufficient fuel for the merchant ships.\u3011\u30103. Providing sufficient food for the crew members.\u3011\u30104. Successfully sending the merchant ships home.\u3011\u3010The scores are calculated as follows:\u3011\u3010A total of 3 points for repairing the merchant ship, including 1.5 points for preparing the materials and 1.5 points for repairing.\u3011\u3010A total of 4 points for providing sufficient fuel for the merchant ships.\u3011\u3010The total for provision of sufficient food for the merchants was originally 2 points but because the food far exceeded minimum requirements and is enough to provide the crew with filling meals every day, additional reward conditions are met. Applicable examinees are rewarded 6 points.\u3011\u3010A total of 15 points for sending the merchant ships home as it was the main subject of this exam.\u3011As the system calculated, several of the examinees were in daze.Because all the scores being added was too shocking\u2026\u2026\u2026Apart from the 6 points for the food, they received points for all the other areas. In total, 22 points\u2026\u2026\u2026..22 points!Di Li\u2019s group who had the most points immediately flew to 69.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netShu Xue\u2019s group also changed into 56. Even Wu Li the silent, rational and down-to-earth person was shocked for a moment.Apart from them, two groups received the extra six points.One group was undoubtedly You Huo and Qin Jiu. They instantly swept from 24.25 points to 52.25 points.The other group was Chen Fei and Huang Rui, but they didn\u2019t receive the full 6 points an only got an additional 3 points.These two in the last ranked group was probably the most dumbfounded of them all.\u201cWhy did we get three extra points\u2026\u2026?\u201d Chen Fei was confused.Huang Rui was even more confused.Sometimes when good things come too suddenly, it conversely seemed more like a scam.Right now, they felt that the system was cheating them.This continued until You Huo suddenly spoke up: \u201cYou also hit the octopus. Is there a problem with that?\u201dThe two returned to their senses: \u201cBut\u2026\u2026that also counts?\u201d\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it count?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThey wanted to say that they only hit the octopus because they were caught by it, because they had no other choice. As for those two, they did it on their own initiative. It wasn\u2019t the same.But if they said it, they feared that these two great masters would probably just glance at them.And so, they hesitated for a moment before finally peeping out a small \u201cthank you\u201d.You Huo looked at them strangely: \u201cWhy are you thinking us? You did it yourself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dChen Fei and Huang Rui were at a loss for a long time. They didn\u2019t know how to refute.Once the scores were finalised, the cave was filled with excitement.For most of the people there, this was their first time feeling so excited after an exam. It was as if they will soon be able to go home.Di Li forcefully pinched his thigh and then moved to pinch Brother Li: \u201cSorry, just confirming.\u201dBrother Li: \u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dDi Li: \u201cIt hurts. Does it hurt for you?\u201dBrother Li: \u201cIt hurts a lot, so it\u2019s not a dream.\u201dDi Li: \u201cThen does that mean that we have already completed 60 points???\u201dBrother Li: \u201cYeah\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dNot only 60, they even exceeded it by 9 points.The second ranked group also felt like they were in a dream: \u201cWe also have completed it. 68 points. According to normal circumstances, does this mean we passed?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only the third subject and our scores are already so high?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think something\u2019s not right?\u201dThe examinees didn\u2019t notice the problem. It wasn\u2019t until former invigilator Qin Jiu burst their bubble.\u201cWake up. This is two people\u2019s total score.\u201dThis one slap of his instantly woke everyone from their daze.Total score\u2026\u2026.Then this meant that everyone\u2019s true score would be cut in half.Everyone was struck by lightning.But the damages inflicted on them didn\u2019t stop there.The system took a deep breath and continued. It always has a knack for picking the most appropriate time to give them examinees another blow.\u3010All points have now been allocated. Bonus points and penalties will now be applied.\u3011\u3010Today, examinees could be penalised for two areas.\u3011\u30101. Damaging the examination centre\u2019s punishment mechanism and deliberately setting the punishment device free.\u3011Examinees: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThat\u2019s right\u2026\u2026\u2026..The octopuses left together with the merchant ships.But if you called that \u201csetting free\u201d, the octopuses definitely would not agree.\u30102. The purpose of this exam was for all crew members of the merchant ships to be sent home, that is, the living crew and their eight dead crew members. Examinees have exaggerated the meaning of the words and made incorrect interpretations ultimately maliciously setting free hidden parts of the exam.\u3011Examinees: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s right\u2026\u2026.Those faces also left\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..But if they only took those eight people, the faces definitely wouldn\u2019t agree.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netDespite the fact that there were no undulations in the system\u2019s voices, everyone felt that the system was seemingly scolding them.After the scolding, it said:\u3010The scores are calculated as follows:\u3011\u3010A total of 5 points deducted for applicable examinees for setting free the punishment device.\u3011Everyone\u2019s points fell.\u3010A total of 5 points deducted for applicable examinees for setting free the hidden part of the exam.\u3011Only You Huo and Qin Jiu\u2019s groups points fell.Examinees: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dEveryone immediately fell into discussion.Di Li\u2019s voice was again the loudest: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Didn\u2019t everyone drag the ship with bones over?\u201dBut the system ignored them and stubbornly continued to report the final result.\u3010All examinees have completed three exams. The following ranking is calculated based on your performance in comparison to examinees in similar situations worldwide:\u3011Again, scratching sounds came from the stone wall.An additional line announcing grades appeared.Although 5 points were deducted, the examinees in the first six groups sat firmly in A.Most of the remainder examinees were actually in B, including Shu Xue and Wu Li.Only two groups fell in the C rank:You Huo, Qin Jiu: 42.25Chen Fei, Huang Rui: 38\u3010Examinees ranked B or above can successfully continue on to their next examination. Please return to the ship you arrived on within 5 minutes. You will be sent back to the rest stop for a short break.\u3011\u3010C ranked examinees will retake the exam as specified by the rules.\u3011The system paused and said:\u3010In view of the fact that the punishment device was set free and the examination room emptied, a new round of examination cannot proceed. C ranked examinees will be taken back by the invigilators and will undergo re-examination at another examination centre.\u3011\u3010Examinees You Huo and Qin Jiu\u2019s act of damaging the examination ship and instigating the punishment device to attack the invigilators have violated examinations rules. They will similarly be taken back by the invigilators and will undergo re-examination after punishment.\u3011The two rule violators looked at the score wall as if they were looking at an idiot. They were completely indifferent.The announcement this time was unprecedentedly long. Everyone seemed to sense a hint of tiredness in the system\u2019s voice.It must have been very angry, but it persisted with forcing out its next words:\u3010In addition, the total time spend in this exam was 4 days which was far less than the average time required. All examinees are rewarded one card drawing opportunity. Invigilators will implement this.\u3011Whether it is to deal with the C ranked examinees, to punish the violators or to draw cards, it all involved the invigilators.This is on the premise that they can come\u2026\u2026\u2026.The system said: \u3010Invigilators 021, 078, 154 and 922 have been notified.\u3011\u3010Invigilator\u2019s ship is currently on its way to be repaired.\u3011Qin Jiu finally let out a mocking laugh.The roasted rabbit instantly combusted on the spot.As the examinees ranked B and above left the cave, You Huo asked: \u201cWith the ship damaged, can they still punish us as usual?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cDid you think that we\u2019re going back to the invigilator\u2019s ship?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201dChen Fei and Huang Rui came over to listen. It was their first time encountering this and they were very uneasy.Qin Jiu said: \u201cIf an examinee happens to violate rules just as the exam ends, they don\u2019t go to the invigilator\u2019s quarter in the examination centre. Instead, they are sent to the invigilator\u2019s district.\u201d\u201cInvigilator\u2019s district?\u201d\u201cA place that looks no different from a normal city. It has a punishment sector and a special situation management sector. Apart from those special sectors, everything else is there. Sometimes, it even gives people the illusion that they\u2019re living a normal urban life.\u201dQin Jiu paused and added: \u201cInvigilators also all live there.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cAll invigilators?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cYes, all.\u201dIncluding the present ones, and also the past.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: New arc~Small note: Just saw a review on NU for this novel complaining about You Huo having too much luck.

Red Harbour Wharf.The signal light flashed in the dark night. On the electronic screen nearby, 9:03pm was displayed.Gentle splashes could be heard as the white ship docked safely at the wharf.A rope ladder was thrown down and several figures disembarked one after another.The system\u2019s familiar voice sounded in thin air:\u3010Welcome back.\u3011Fuck.Chen Fei who was climbing down the ladder slipped and almost stepped onto Huang Rui\u2019s head.\u201cYou can\u2019t even get off a ship?\u201d922 quickly grabbed him to prevent the two from falling into a heap.Chen Fei looked around in shock: \u201cWhy is there another examination broadcast?\u201d\u201cThis is the base camp. The system is everywhere. I suggest you adapt to it.\u201d Qin Jiu said casually.Base camp?You Huo took this in and looked into the distance.Just as Qin Jiu described, this place looked like an ordinary coastal city.Lights from the tall buildings shone down and crossed with each other to form colourful patterns.Standing there, he could even feel the city\u2019s liveliness.922 was still counting for the examinees: \u201cParking, stopping at traffic lights, swiping your card, ringing the doorbell\u2026\u2026.In any case, it\u2019s everywhere. You\u2019d better be prepared for it. It would be a pain having you trip every time.\u201dChen Fei and Huang Rui glanced at each other. They were utterly petrified.021 also came down in her high heels.As soon as she stepped down onto the wharf, the system\u2019s voice sounded again:\u3010December 30<sup>th</sup> 21:05pm. The outdoor temperature is -4 \u2103. Invigilator\u2019s equipment no. 09271 was docked at Pier 13.\u3011Chen Fei and Huang Rui still felt their scalp go numb when they heard it, but this time they managed to remain standing.\u201cIt\u2019s already past 9. If nothing happened along the way, we could have actually returned during the day.\u201d 078 couldn\u2019t help but mutter.It took them two hours to repair the ship.After finally picking up the examinees and making their way back to the invigilator\u2019s district, 021 had lost her invigilator\u2019s card so they had to turn back to pick it up. This return trip alone took another four hours.078 was a strange man with very low EQ.He originally only wanted to complain about the repairing of the ship with the intention to make the rule violating examinees feel a little guilty. Afterall, attacking an invigilator was too much and almost unheard of.But in the end, the examinees were unmoved, and he had instead provoked 021.\u201cAre you trying to say that I\u2019m scatterbrained?\u201d\u201cNo, no, of course not! I was just commenting that it\u2019s already past nine. I had no other intention.\u201d 078 immediately explained.As this young lady was easily provoked, his body had already developed a reflex to apologise as soon as he could.Apologise first. There was nothing wrong with calming the situation down.021 naturally wasn\u2019t someone scatterbrained. She would never lose anything important.Please read this from kk translatesThe reason why she would lose her card on the island and only notice two hours later was because she wanted to drag it out into the night.The invigilator\u2019s district was a place where all invigilators lived.This includes the later ones, and also the original early invigilators.There weren\u2019t many of the initial invigilators, only a dozen. English letters alone were enough for their code names. Later, because there were more problems that needed to be addressed, the system selected several powerful figures from amongst the examinees to add to the original group of invigilators.After the first supplementation, the invigilators totalled 50 people.These newly added invigilators quickly took up the remaining letters and were allocated based on chronological order of joining. The rest of them started with English letter combinations. It was a little like English names.Qin Jiu was one of them.And this group of invigilators have worked with A.021 later quietly calculated\u2014\u2014\u2013During all these years, one of the 50 early invigilators was demoted to a rest stop very early on. Unless it was due to special circumstances, an invigilator would not go to the rest stop, so she had never seen that invigilator in person, and only saw their picture.13 were injured due to various official activities and were recovering in the rehabilitation centres. They were heavily guarded there so, for the time being, they will not be able to leave the hospital.26 had been dispatched abroad. As each examination wasn\u2019t short, and they didn\u2019t have great masters like You Huo or Qin Jiu guiding them, it was unlikely for the exam to end early and for them to run back here.In other words, apart from You Huo who had a problem with his mind and Qin Jiu who also had a problem with his mind, there are 8 early invigilators in this invigilator\u2019s district.They. All. Know. A.That was too scary.021 didn\u2019t know what You Huo was planning. She suspected that this Big Invigilator himself probably didn\u2019t know either.But she felt that having people recognise You Huo early on may not help this invigilator with what he wanted to do.And so, she could only try her best to keep You Huo away from those eight invigilators. The further away, the better.After changing into letter combinations, the code names for the invigilators later became numbers. The early invigilators were usually ranked relatively high.Based on Miss 021\u2019s observations, the four invigilators 016, 025, 033 and 058 were frequently spotted in this part of the district.Straight ahead down the lively Baihua Street was 016 and 025\u2019s current place of residence.025 in particular liked to sit by the window to smoke.And there was a bar there that 058 would visit almost every night.Sometimes 058 would return at 9 o\u2019clock, sometimes at 11 o\u2019clock.If 021 walked down this street ten times, eight times out of ten she would run into one of them. It was unavoidable.With this frequency, she was determined to steer away from this street.***\u201cYou two don\u2019t need to be punished but you will need to stay in the waiting sector.\u201d 078 called Chen Fei and Huang Rui over, \u201cThat place is composed of apartments. In a while, I\u2019ll take you over to get some simple paperwork sorted.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s the waiting sector?\u201d\u201cOver there.\u201d 078 pointed.Chen Fei and Huang Rui stuck their necks out and looked over.Behind the street near the wharf, one could vaguely make out the outline of two tall twin towers.Symmetrically, the two towers shot up into the sky. Many windows were lit up.\u201cYou\u2019re looking at the wrong one. The twin tower is the punishment sector. You\u2019re going to those small buildings next to it.\u201d 078 pointed at You Huo and Qin Jiu and explained to the other two examinees: \u201cAs for these two gentlemen, the punishment will last three days. During these three days, you will wait in the waiting sector. Once they\u2019re done with their punishment, we will arrange a new examination for you all.\u201dHe started making his way over: \u201cLet\u2019s go through Baihua Street.\u201dAs he said that, someone appeared outside the Baihua Street Bar.Those familiar with him could recognise him at first glance. It was the early Invigilator 058.Qin Jiu saw him and immediately turned around, \u201cNot going.\u201d078: \u201c?\u201d021 still had the word \u201cno\u201d on the tip of her tongue. She quietly swallowed it back down.Did 001 take the wrong medicine? Why was he standing on the same side as me?078 was at a loss: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Baihua Street?\u201dQin Jiu glanced at You Huo from his peripheral vision and started talking nonsense, \u201cThe bar\u2019s filled with smoke. I\u2019ve been annoyed by it for a long time.\u201d078: \u201c?\u201dWhat smoke? Do you realise that bar prohibits smoking?You can\u2019t just tarnish the bar\u2019s reputation just because someone came out from it\u2026\u2026078 didn\u2019t dare retort and could only ask pathetically: \u201cThen where should we go?\u201dQin Jiu randomly pointed down a small alley furthest away from Baihua Street: \u201cThere.\u201d078: \u201c\u2026\u2026.Are you sure?\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesQin Jiu grunted and proceeded walk down that small alley.154 and 922 were originally his subordinates so they immediately followed after him.Even 021 had no objections. Wearing her high heels, she turned around and followed.078 watched them with confusion. He wondered if he really wasn\u2019t going mad.Rather than going down the brightly lit street, they opted to go down a small, dark alley\u2026\u2026What\u2019s going on? Were there ghosts waiting to attack you on Baihua street?Regardless of whether there really were ghosts, they all turned into the quiet alley.The drunk 058 seemed to have ran into someone and was laughing loudly.Because it was quiet, his laughter travelled all the way over to them before gradually getting further and further away.021 quietly breathed a sigh of relief.You Huo didn\u2019t seem to have noticed 058. He continued to look down and fiddle with his phone.Very soon, they passed through the small alley. Just as two of them hoped, they didn\u2019t run into any acquaintances.***The twin towers stood in the middle of the prosperous city. It had a stone wall separating the prosperous city from the tower.\u201cI will take them to the waiting sector. Do you want to go up first?\u201d078 stopped below the twin towers and pointed to the small building next to it.For once, 021 said cooperatively: \u201cWe\u2019ll just wait for you here. It\u2019s just a few minutes.\u201d078 grinned and quickly took the examinees away.You Huo watched the three of them disappear into the night and then looked up at the twin towers.The exterior of the tall towers reflected dark blue light. It gave it an unapproachable and cold impression. Through the large glass windows, lights inside it shone out like stars.For a moment, You Huo found this scene familiar. It was an inexplicable sense of familiarity.It as if he had once similarly looked up at the towers like this.You Huo removed his gaze and subconsciously glanced around.He suddenly stopped and pointed at an area with villas to the east of the towers: \u201cWhat\u2019s that there?\u201dQin Jiu glanced at where he was pointing: \u201cI live there.\u201dYou Huo\u2019s expression turned strange for a moment: \u201cYou live there?\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201d He then turned around and looked at You Huo with a raised eyebrow: \u201cSince we\u2019re on this topic, why don\u2019t we take a look while we have time to spare?\u201dNo.No time.Nothing to spare.021\u2019s lips twitched.But in the end, You Huo nodded.021 silently turned around. Looking up at the night sky, she gave it a massive eyeroll\u2014\u2014Some people\u2026\u2026Once there\u2019s something wrong with their mind, they would nod at anything!Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: HAHAHA Feeling bad for 021Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thinking that his answer might not be enough, he turned and repeated it to 021: \u201cThere are indeed none.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d021 glared at him.Of course, there aren\u2019t any damned rules like that. Because there hasn\u2019t been an invigilator like your boss before. You should know that too, okay?She was determined to argue back. In any case, everyone was already aware that she didn\u2019t like 001.But the frustrating thing was that the amnesiac Invigilator A had a good relationship with him. If her attitude was bad, it might affect her image.So, she could only hold back and change her words: \u201cExaminees cannot enter the invigilators residence for no reason. This is clearly written in the rules. I\u2019m afraid you must have forgotten about this.\u201dQin Jiu indeed forgot about it.He \u201coh\u201ded and then said unhurriedly: \u201cIf there\u2019s a reason then it\u2019s okay.\u201dYour uncle\u2019s the reason.021\u2019s could almost no longer maintain her cold expression: \u201cThe place of residence for the next three days for the punished examinees have already been arranged. If you have a problem with it, go and talk to the system. After the punishment, it is your business if you want to go home. I have no authority on that.\u201dWhen she was done, she entered the building accompanied by the clack of her high heels.***The twin towers looked like ordinary commercial buildings. On the first floor, there were three elevator doors.Each door had a different indicator light; red, white and blue.922 who was still absentminded subconsciously stood before the elevator with the red light and was glared at by 021.\u201cWrong one.\u201d 154 pulled him over to stand before the elevator with the blue light and reminded: \u201cBoss didn\u2019t violate the rules in the living quarters. He is considered as an examinee for these few rounds.\u201dYou Huo heard this and internally understood\u2014\u2014\u2014Those three elevators cannot be used randomly. They were probably divided acording to on one\u2019s identity.The one with the blue light was for examinees.The one with the red light was for invigilators.Then what about the one with the white light?For NPC\u2019s? Rest stop owners, drivers and servers?You Huo was a little curious.Two successive \u201cdings\u201d sounded in succession in the hall.The door to the elevator with the blue light before them opened, and the door to the elevator with the red light next to it also opened.Two people came out one after the other.The one ahead was a young man. He was dressed meticulously and could be comparable to that of 154.Seeing that there were others in the hall, he stopped for a moment before nodding: \u201cGood evening.\u201dIt may be because of Qin Jiu\u2019s presence, he nodded at a larger angle to demonstrate respect.When he looked up, he would occasionally secretly glance at 021. His expression was serious, but you could see his ears slightly tinged red.Following behind him was a middle-aged man.Please read this from kk translatesHis hair had not been taken care of and was messy like a birds\u2019 nest. On his chin were some stubble. He probably hadn\u2019t shaved in days.The moment she saw him, 021 froze.Afterall, this person was also one of the earlier group of invigilators. He similarly knows Invigilator A.It is said that he was once very powerful, and his age seemed to have no effect on him. He was however later injured and, since then, his physical abilities plummeted such that he was now ranked 1006.This was also something that was determined taking into consideration his performance in the earlier years.If they only considered the past two years, he would likely be ranked towards the end.021 internally wondered why people who normally were difficult to run into on a normal day kept appearing today. It really made things difficult for her.Fortunately, 1006 was an old bird.With half-opened eyes, he looked over, raised his hand and mumbled out a \u201cHi\u201d. He probably didn\u2019t even see them properly.He then turned around and left.021 breathed a sigh of relief.She held the door open and ushered them in: \u201cHurry in.\u201dAs she said that, 078 had just returned. He managed to get onto the elevator in time.There were no buttons inside the elevator to select the floor. It went up by itself.You Huo glanced around.Qin Jiu explained: \u201cThe floor it stops at is random.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201dHe thought Qin Jiu would say \u201cdifficulty\u201d or the like, but the other party instead said: \u201cThe difference between good luck and bad luck.\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t bother with giving him any more attention.After a few seconds, he suddenly remembered something: \u201cThat guy earlier was also an invigilator?\u201dIt was his first time seeing an invigilator like that.021 really wanted to answer You Huo but she had to do her best to continue acting cold and aloof.But the next second, she regretted not saying anything.Because the one answering was Qin Jiu again.\u201cAn invigilator who had just finished his punishment.\u201d Qin Jiu said.\u201cWhat? Who?\u201d 078 couldn\u2019t keep up.154: \u201cJust ran into 1006.\u201d078 instantly understood: \u201cOh I think I saw him. I ran too quickly and didn\u2019t have the chance to greet him. He was punished again?\u201d154: \u201cYeah.\u201d078: \u201cThen he probably didn\u2019t look good.\u201d154: \u201cYeah, quite haggard.\u201d078 glanced at You Huo. He deliberately tried to scare him: \u201cAfterall, punishments can be very hard on you.\u201dHe smacked his mouth a few times and glanced at You Huo again.The other party was still indifferent.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d078 felt that he had just blinded himself with his acting.***The elevator soon stopped.The metal doors opened, but the four invigilators didn\u2019t move.\u201cWe\u2019re here. You can get off. The punishment this time is to clean the examination centre.\u201d 078 took out his phone and glanced at the time: \u201cIt is now 9:30pm. It\u2019s a little late but I hope you can finish in one night. We\u2019ll see you when you\u2019re done.\u201dWhen he was done, the elevator door once again closed and took the four invigilators back down.\u201cWhat does cleaning the examination centre mean?\u201d You Huo retracted his gaze from the closed elevator doors.\u201cOnce an examination is over, some examination centres can get quite ugly and require some cleaning.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cThe system made this a punishment because the trouble you can encounter while cleaning won\u2019t necessarily be less than the exam itself.\u201dWhen he was done, he stopped and then added: \u201cWith the exception of a destroyed examination centre.\u201dYou Huo nodded.The floor they were at was a large empty floor.Right opposite the elevator was a large French window. A grey-haired old man sat by it with his head hanging low as he slept.The conversation and commotion just now didn\u2019t wake him,\u201cLook for him?\u201d You Huo pointed at the old man with his chin.Qin Jiu glanced around: \u201cI guess so. I don\u2019t see a second living being here.\u201dWhat do you mean I guess so\u2026\u2026\u2026..?You Huo: \u201cYou haven\u2019t been here before?\u201d\u201cI think you have a slight misunderstanding. Generally speaking, I abide to the rules and regulations quite well.\u201d Qin Jiu said.He walked over to the old man and snapped his fingers before him a few times.Once he was done, he turned around and said to You Huo: \u201cThis is my first time.\u201dThe old man was startled awake.He looked up and said as soon as he saw Qin Jiu: \u201cWhy are you here again?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.Who?\u201dOld man: \u201cYou.\u201dQin Jiu said peevishly: \u201cYou got the wrong person.\u201dThe old man seemed to be a little confused.His old eyes stared at Qin Jiu for a moment before murmuring: \u201cWrong person? Ah\u2026\u2026That might be true. My memory hasn\u2019t been good lately.\u201dThe old man bowed his head in thought for a moment and then brushed through his hair with his fingers: \u201cForget it, don\u2019t worry about it. Here\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dHe pointed at a metal panel in front of him: \u201cPress your palm here. I need to register your violation information.\u201dQin Jiu did as he was told.The moment his palm was pressed onto it, several lines appeared on the screen.Name: Qin JiuExamination ticket number: 86010-06141729-GiAssociated examination ticket number: 86010-06141729-82Past record: 12 timesThe old man was instantly revigorated: \u201cTwelve times! I knew I didn\u2019t get the wrong person, it is you!\u201dQin Jiu himself was stunned.He turned to look at You Huo.You Huo: \u201cLet me tell you a joke. It\u2019s my first time here.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cDid you miss a digit?\u201dQin Jiu stared at the information and rubbed his neck: \u201cIt\u2019s associated with the old examination ticket number. It was probably from when I was an examinee.\u201dBut twelve times\u2026\u2026\u2026You Huo: \u201cSince you violated the rules just as the exam ended, you violated rules in twelve exams?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..I guess.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s now a five-subject exam. How many subjects were there in your time? Fifteen?\u201dBefore Qin Jiu could answer, the old man interjected: \u201cWhat fifteen? It\u2019s just five subjects. At most nine.\u201dQin Jiu raised his eyebrow.The old man said: \u201cPut that eyebrow back down. I definitely remember you! Although my memory is getting bad and my body is old, I still remember you. You left a deep impression\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dPlease read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen.It was indeed a deep impression.As he got older, his mind and body gradually got duller.What he did before, why he came here, when he started watching over this place\u2026\u2026\u2026All these things, the old man no longer remembered.On the contrary, it was the examinees he met as he watched over this place over these years that he still had some impression of.Qin Jiu was one who he had more of an impression of.He could even remember bits and pieces.Something like this was really not easy for him.***It was a rainy day. The scene outside the window was completely grey. Lighting flashed and thunder crashed.The napping old man was woken from his slumber by the thunder and wasn\u2019t able to fall asleep again.He was staring out the window in daze when the elevator suddenly rang.He turned around and looked over.Two people stood inside the open elevator.One was Qin Jiu. The other stood in the corner of the elevator but because of the angle, he never saw his face.All he could see was the hand holding the railing, the white and clean shirt cuffs, and black military boots.Qin Jiu raised his hand and greeted the old man: \u201cGood afternoon.\u201dThe old man said: \u201cWhy is it you again?\u201dQin Jiu smiled: \u201cYeah, I\u2019m here again.\u201dThis examinee\u2019s lazy demeanour really made others want to kick his ass.Not only did the old man think this, the one inside the elevator thought the same.The old man saw the military boots move. That person said to Qin Jiu: \u201cGet out of the elevator and chat. Stop holding the door. I\u2019m busy.\u201d\u201cWhy are you busy?\u201d Qin Jiu asked back.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Meeting. Does it have anything to do with you?\u201dQin Jiu grunted and said without answering his question: \u201cPretty good, you\u2019ve improved.\u201d\u201cImproved what?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cWill now answer questions. A bit more enthusiastic compared to last time. A definite change compared to last, last time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe old man who heard this also felt his feet itch.If he wore boots, he would have already kicked him.Sure enough, he saw one of the military boots raise.Qin Jiu just laughed, stepped aside and walked out the elevator.He pressed the down button for the invigilator and when the elevator door slowly closed, he waved at the person inside: \u201cTry harder next time Big Invigilator.\u201dThe elevator descended.Qin Jiu turned around and walked over to the old man. Familiar with how everything worked, he pressed his palm onto the panel.With a beep, several lines appeared on the screen:Name: Qin JiuExamination ticket number: 86010-06141729-82Past record: 5 timesThe old man couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cHow many subjects did you do?\u201d\u201cFive.\u201dThe old man\u2019s expression turned incomprehensible: \u201cAre you coming here once for every subject?\u201d\u201cNot exactly. I had to retake my exam twice, so I guess for seven exams, I came here five times.\u201d\u201cAre you proud of that?\u201dQin Jiu smiled again.This examinee would often be smiling. When he spoke, he would smile. If he was too lazy to speak, he would be smiling.But these smiles of his would be 80-90% filled with arrogance.He probably isn\u2019t a decent person inside and out.In short, it made one gnash their teeth.The old man said: \u201cYou should be on your last subject now? You\u2019ll be leaving after this punishment?\u201d\u201cNot necessarily.\u201dThe old man choked on his water: \u201cIsn\u2019t this a five-subject exam?!\u201dQin Jiu pulled out a card from his pocket: \u201cStill have one left.\u201dThe old man took a closer look. On the card were two bold words: Retake Exam.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dQin Jiu then said: \u201cBut it\u2019s a pity it might not be used now.\u201dThe old man asked curiously: \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause I drew a black card. Exam reformation.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cIf I base it on ranks, I just need to stay on C.\u201dOld man: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dWhat do you mean just stay on C???He sincerely believed that this examinee may be a psychopath.He slammed down the control button.In an instant, the French window disappeared. The thunderstorm outside blew in.The place where the old man sat was just outside its range.This place was the punishment sector. The punishment involves cleaning up an examination centre. The examination centre is chosen at random.As long as the examinee climbs down from the opening left by the French window, the examination centre one finds themselves in when they reach the ground is the one they are required to clean.The old man had always felt that the climbing process was probably the most terrible part of the punishment.With such a tall building, not to mention climbing down, just standing on the edge and looking down can make people\u2019s legs go soft.He had seen plenty climb while crying.The only exception was Qin Jiu.This man had been training in the army for a long time and wasn\u2019t afraid of anything.Watching him walk towards the window, the old man couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cWhy are you retaking exams all the time? Getting more points?\u201dQin Jiu stopped at the edge. Raindrops slid down his handsome, sculptured face.He smiled and said: \u201cYou guess.\u201dHe then turned and jumped out.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nKK has something to say:\u201cPut that eyebrow back down.\u201d \u2013 This made me laugh \ud83d\ude02Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On the other hand, it depended on luck.If they were allocated a simple exam centre, there was less trouble. If they were allocated a difficult one, even their lives could be lost.The punishment time specified by the system was three days.The old main had been watching over this place for a long time so he had also seen many things.In general, when the three days are up, the examinees will still be nowhere in sight. The invigilator responsible would need to go down and pick them up for the punishment to be considered as complete.But Qin Jiu was always an exception. He would always finish in advance.Sometimes, it was half a day. Other times, it was a whole day.The old man no longer remembered the specifics. He just remembered that there was one time where Qin Jiu overdid it\u2026\u2026\u2026After Qin Jiu jumped out that day, the French windows were closed up again.Torrential rain outside had not stopped. It continued to smack against the glass.The old man looked outside the window, trying to recall events from long ago.He had always wondered why he would be here watching over this place, but he couldn\u2019t remember.Bored, he fiddled with the metal panel before him and casually flipped through the records.There are several of these metal panels in the invigilator\u2019s district. They are installed at various punishment sites and the systems are all interconnected.It didn\u2019t have any authoritative powers and was just used as a recording device.Whether it\u2019s an invigilator or an examinee, anyone who had violated the rules before would be recorded here.The people here weren\u2019t interested in reading past records, but the old man enjoyed it.The names of the examinees were all unfamiliar, and he couldn\u2019t match the invigilators with their code names.But he flipped through the records mainly so that he could feel a little more human.This place here was too systematic and uniform. Even the people here were so systematic, they almost seemed lifeless.It was only the moment when someone steps outside of the rule boundaries that there would be a trace of human vitality.And so, in a place like this, someone like Qin Jiu was extremely eye-catching.It didn\u2019t matter if you liked or hated himIn any case, you would always notice him, and remember him.The old man flipped through for a while before soon rolling his head and dozing off.After an unknown amount of time passed, he was once again startled awake by the thunder.In a still confused and drowsy state, he heard knocking sounds.Knock, knock, knock\u2014\u2014\u2013Who?The old man opened his eyes and subconsciously looked towards the elevator.The elevator door was still closed. No one came.Besides, who in the right mind would knock on an elevator door?He yawned and got ready to continue sleeping.The knocking sounded again.Knock, knock, knock\u2014\u2014\u2014-The old man froze for a moment and suddenly realised that the sound was coming from the window\u2026\u2026\u2026Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen.He quickly looked over. As he did that, he almost twisted those old bones of his.Outside the window, the sky had become darker.The torrential rain was still falling leaving behind water streaks on the windowpane. The lights from the city down below illuminated those water streaks which scattered light everywhere.And amongst it, there was a blurry figure\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe old man clutched his chest and slowly inched closer.The tiny platform outside the window could barely support someone.That examinee called Qin Jiu looked like he had just arrived and was squatting there removing white bandages from his left hand.The old man turned his head slightly and glanced at the time.Since the time this person jumped off\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.it hadn\u2019t even been six hours??While he was still in his surprised state, the elevator suddenly opened with a \u201cding\u201d.A young invigilator wearing the invigilator\u2019s uniform walked out.He appeared to have just left a meeting as he was still wearing his special glasses. The dark brown lenses covered the upper half of his face.The old man quickly glanced at him.Even if only the lower half of his face was exposed, he could tell that he had the looks that could bring calamity.\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026here for the examinee?\u201d The old man asked with hesitation.The invigilator didn\u2019t answer very enthusiastically: \u201cJust happened to pass by.\u201dThe old man who finally found his saviour immediately said: \u201cYou came just in time! Your examinee just came out.\u201dHe quickly pressed the control button.The French window disappeared, and cold wind accompanied by rain droplets poured in.Qin Jiu stood up straight. As he undid the bandage knot on his right hand with his teeth, he raised his eyes and looked into the room.The moment he saw the invigilator, he was a little surprised but the next second it changed into a smile.\u201cI thought I would have to wait a while today. I didn\u2019t expect you to be so fast.\u201dHe then brushed his wet hair back and walked in while holding the bandages. He said to the old man: \u201cWhere can I throw this?\u201dThe old\u2019s lips twitched and pointed next to his seat: \u201cThere\u2019s a bin over there.\u201dQin Jiu went around the table to throw it, and even helped him press the control button along the way.The French window once again closed, blocking the wind and rain outside.\u201cYou might need to get someone to mop the floor.\u201d Qin Jiu glanced down at the wet footprints he had left behind.Is this the time to talk about mopping the floor?The old man internally thought.Although he couldn\u2019t see the invigilator\u2019s eyes and eyebrows, the old man was certain that he must be frowning.\u201cYou have completed the cleaning task?\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cSo fast?\u201d The invigilator asked suspiciously.Qin Jiu smiled more deeply: \u201cI know your intention is to question me but that tone really makes me a little\u2026\u2026proud.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe invigilator\u2019s lips pursed into a straight line.The old man couldn\u2019t help but cut in: \u201cWhat now?\u201dThis had not happened before.As stipulated by the system, examinees will need to stay in the invigilator\u2019s district for three days. Originally, those three days would be the time the examinee spends cleaning the examination centre so there was no need to consider the issue of food and accommodation.Now with Qin Jiu finishing in less than a day, how they were going to deal with the remaining two days had become an issue\u2026\u2026..\u201cAny relevant regulations?\u201d The old man asked.The invigilator said: \u201cNo.\u201dHe paused and added another sentence: \u201cNone at the moment.\u201dAt the moment\u2026\u2026\u2026The old man internally thought: If this happens two more times, the system should quietly go and update its rules.For example, regardless of whether or not they would end up using it, they should first assign a place somewhere for them to stay to avoid something as unusual as this happening.But that was for future cases.Right now, that very unusual being was standing right before them\u2026\u2026.so they had to decide on what to do.The invigilator was ruthless.He looked around and said to the old man: \u201cGive him a bed. I\u2019ll pick him up in two days.\u201dQin Jiu squinted his eyes.The old man immediately refused: \u201cNo, that can\u2019t do.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d\u201cNo bed.\u201d The old man said: \u201cDespite this place being so big, there\u2019s nothing here. It\u2019s only enough for me alone.\u201dAs he said that, Qin Jiu suddenly turned his head and sneezed.The invigilator\u2019s lips were pursed even more firmly into a straight line.Through the dark lenses, you could see his knitted brows.He then said stiffly: \u201cFollow me down.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cHuh?\u201dInvigilator: \u201c\u2026\u2026.Follow me down. Don\u2019t make me say it a third time.\u201d\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Qin Jiu started dragging his voice as he rambled on nonsensically: \u201cI am now drenched from the rain and I\u2019ve exhausted all my energy. If you deal with me irresponsibly, my life might be in danger.\u201dPlease read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen.The old man couldn\u2019t help but roll his eyes.He suspected that the invigilator might have also rolled his eyes under those lenses.The invigilator looked at Qin Jiu expressionlessly for a while before saying: \u201cGo to my place. You won\u2019t die.\u201dThere was a trace of surprise on Qin Jiu\u2019s face.Without waiting for the other party to answer, the invigilator had already turned around and moved to wait for the elevator.Qin Jiu leaned against the metal panel. He stared at his back for a while before straightening himself up.The elevator arrived with a \u201cding\u201d. The invigilator didn\u2019t wait for him and went straight in.Qin Jiu waved at the old man and quickly strode over. Just as the doors were about to close, he stuck his hand in and walked in with a smile on his face.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026What happened after that, the old man could no longer remember clearly.It seems that Qin Jiu really did stay at that invigilator\u2019s place for two days.In order to meet the punishment objective and to avoid being too lax around the rule-violating Qin Jiu, the examination system had implemented some measures as last minute solutions. In a way, it was its way of tying up one of its loose ends\u2014\u2014\u2013The invigilator had vacated a room out and the system changed it into a confinement room.The specifications of it was exactly the same as a normal confinement room. It was practically a case of copy and paste.For the remaining two days, Qin Jiu had spent it in that confinement room.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026This last-minute solution was maintained for a while.Was it for half a year, or a year?In any case, if anyone completed their punishment ahead of time, they would continue solitary confinement punishment at the invigilator\u2019s place.Later, the system suddenly changed it.Perhaps it felt that it wasn\u2019t right, or perhaps it was because more examinees were completing their punishment ahead of time.It is said that the system later established a place for examinees to stay and several more rules and regulations were added.As for the events after that, the old man didn\u2019t know.As he got older, his memory got worse. He no longer paid attention to the happenings outside.He just remembered that at one point in time, the examinee Qin Jiu no longer appeared.And there was also no more news of that invigilator\u2026\u2026.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: He stayed at Invigilator A\u2019s place~ \ud83e\udd2d\ud83e\udd2dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was especially so when recalling the past.When the old man returned to his senses, he saw a pair of well-defined hand reach over before him, slap the control button and then retract back.The old man looked up. Qin Jiu shot him a smile: \u201cYou can continue. We\u2019ll help ourselves.\u201dWhen he was done saying that, he strode over to the French window. There, the other rule-violating examinee waited.Whoooshhh\u2014\u2014\u2013The window disappeared in an instant. The cold winter night wind rushed in.That examinee stood on the very edge of the platform outside the window looking out at the bright city lights below. Looking from the side, his thin eyelids were half drooped and his expression was both cold and calm.For a moment, the old man had a strange thought\u2014\u2014\u2014If that invigilator that vaguely existed in his memory took off his sunglasses, he would probably have eyes and brows like his.\u2026\u2026\u2026.After You Huo observed for a while, he turned his head and asked: \u201cGo down from here?\u201dThe old man internally felt that even the way they spoke was the same.Like that invigilator, they would always speak in a very unenthusiastic tone.Seeing that it was his first time here, the old man reassured: \u201cYes, just go down from there. If you look down and to the right, you should see a long ladder. You can just follow that down.\u201dYou Huo looked down next to his feet.Nailed to the wall were individual bars one after another. From top to bottom, you couldn\u2019t see the end of it.If one had a fear of heights, they would definitely feel their heart racing just looking at it.Because his temperament seemed so familiar, the old man couldn\u2019t help but say a few more words: \u201cIt\u2019s a little scary like this, right? You actually overcome the psychological part of it rather quickly.\u201dQin Jiu no longer remembered his past twelve punishments.Like it was his first time here, he looked out curiously. He then jokingly smiled and said to You Huo: \u201cDo you need to overcome it? I don\u2019t mind waiting for you for a while. This ladder doesn\u2019t look too long.\u201dYou Huo glanced at him and proceeded to jump off.Qin Jiu stood there for a moment and suddenly let out a laugh. He soon followed after him.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dJumped off in less than a second.The old man swallowed back his words of comfort. He felt that today was very strange.After all these years, that unusual being had now become a pair of unusual beings.But he couldn\u2019t help but sigh.Even though his appearance was unchanged, the Qin Jiu now was not the same as the one back then.He was now like a long sword that was wrapped in a thin film. Only at some inadvertent moments would a small glint of the blade accidentally leak through.As one with years of experience, this type of change wasn\u2019t something new. It was something he commonly saw in everyday life.It was like someone who had lost something important and was unable to find it. They would often be distracted, and others would take it as them being lazy and indifferent. It was only during those moments when they return to their senses that they would reveal a hint of their usual liveliness.That was just like Qin Jiu\u2019s current state.But Qin Jiu\u2019s arms and legs were intact. They\u2019re neither injured nor rendered useless.The old man mulled over this for a long time but couldn\u2019t figure out what he could\u2019ve lost.His head started bobbing as he started dozing off again.As he was about to nod off, the old man suddenly remembered something\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..Ah, that other examinee hasn\u2019t registered yet!***The act of not registering, You Huo had done it intentionally.The memory of that device was too good, and it even held past records. From Qin Jiu\u2019s results, it seems to have bound the examinee and invigilator periods together.If he pressed his hand onto it, his records as Invigilator A might appear.It was better to leave it for now.The falling duration was unexpectedly long.With the cold winter wind rushing from bottom up, it felt like tens of thousands of arrows stabbing into the skin.After a long time, the speed suddenly fell. He smashed into a mound of cushions which cushioned the impact and quickly adjusted his posture as he landed onto the ground.When he stood up and looked around, he saw that he was standing next to a stack of sponge mats which were covered with a dark green cover. It was these things that had cushioned his fall earlier.Not far away was a sandpit and a little further from that was a rubber running track and a field of grass.This was a sports field.With the sun setting in the background, students were grouped in threes and fours. Laughter was everywhere.Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen.Apart from where You Huo stood, there were people no matter where he looked.Another thud sounded from the mats next to him.You Huo turned his heand and saw Qin Jiu flip over and jump off the mats.\u201cWhere is this?\u201d Qin Jiu\u2019s dark eyes scanned around: \u201cA school?\u201d\u201cMhn.\u201d You Huo said: \u201cAre you sure this is right?\u201dEverywhere looked clean and tidy. You Huo didn\u2019t see a need for them to be here.They shouldn\u2019t be called here just to dust the windows.\u201cWhen it comes to punishing people, the system never makes mistakes.\u201d Qin Jiu walked around the mats that reached his waist and said: \u201cLet me see\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s usually a cleaning roster. It tells the punished person what conditions need to be met for the cleaning to be considered as completed \u2014\u2014-Ah, here it is.\u201dThere was a note by Qin Jiu\u2019s feet. It was half-buried in the sandpit.The paper was yellowed which made it easy to overlook.There were a few lines written on the note:> Examined subject: Politics> Examined topic: Philosophy (Materialism and Idealism)> The actions of the examinees from this session were frequently overexcessive resulting in the examination centre going out of control. Effects that were originally limited to only the examinees now also involve everyone in the examination centre (including examinees and the subjects of the question).> According to the rules, restoration and clean up is required following the examination centre going out of control more than five times in a row.> The cleaning tasks are as follows:\u3010Please properly clean up all subjectively conjured objects and restore the examination centre to a functional state.\u3011Politics?Philosophy?Materialism and Idealism?You Huo\u2019s gaze once again moved back to the sports field: \u201cWhere\u2019s the \u2018subjectively conjured objects\u2019?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cNo idea. Perhaps all those people there are.\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t say anything.The bells signalling the end of class rang throughout the teaching buildings. Several physical education teachers standing at different parts of the field blew their whistles.Girls chattered happily as they made their way to gather up while boys dribbled the basketball around a little longer and tried to make a shot first before slowly walking out of the court with the ball.\u201cA little green. Doesn\u2019t seem to like this setting very much.\u201d Qin Jiu said suddenly.You Huo: \u201c?\u201dWhen he returned to his senses, he saw Qin Jiu with hands into his pockets leaning forward in a lazy manner assessing his face.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cReporting the changes to your expressions.\u201d\u201c\u2014\u2014\u2014For a moment it turned white and now it\u2019s stiff.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Jiu\u2019s gaze moved down a little. He watched You Huo\u2019s lips purse into a straight line.You Huo endured for a moment but was no longer able to endure it any longer: \u201cDid you eat something stupid before you came?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Qin Jiu straightened back up, \u201cJumped off a building and now in a pretty good mood.\u201dIf those words were heard by the old man, he would probably clutch his chest again.But the process of falling did indeed give him the thrilling sensation he had long forgotten.However, it wasn\u2019t the fall itself that gave him this feeling. Instead, it was this place.He thought perhaps those twelve punishments he had weren\u2019t that bad. Or perhaps\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. Something good may have happened during those times.Even just that small feeling of deja vu put him in a good mood.***\u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d A voice came from afar.You Huo followed the voice and looked over.A middle-aged woman wearing a coffee-coloured dress waved at them and quickly strode over.\u201cYou\u2019re here to help, right?\u201d The woman asked. \u201cI am the head of the department here. My surname is Xiao. These here are our outstanding young teachers.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThis system\u2019s level of absurdity was really too high.They just needed to clean up yet it felt the need to include an entire scenario for it.\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between this and doing another exam?\u201d You Huo mocked.Qin Jiu: \u201cThere are. There\u2019s the difference of not being last.\u201dThe focus wasn\u2019t on the teachers. After a brief introduction of the young teachers, Director Xiao asked the two: \u201cDo you know the general gist of what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know. Do tell.\u201d Qin Jiu said.\u201cYou don\u2019t know? What are you doing here if you don\u2019t know?\u201d A young man muttered impatiently.There were two dark patches under his eyes. His eyebags were almost about reach the corner of his lips.This was not only the case for him. It was the same for the others there.Standing together, the visual effect of it was rather shocking.Director Xiao pushed up her glasses, looked at him reproachfully and reprimanded: \u201cXiao Zheng!\u201dThe young man reluctantly shut his mouth.Director Xiao nodded politely to Qin Jiu: \u201cSorry about this. They\u2019ve been recently overwhelmed with troubles and haven\u2019t been able to sleep much so they\u2019re exhausted physically and mentally. Sometimes they can be a little anxious.\u201d\u201cWhat troubles?\u201d Qin Jiu probed.You Huo snatched the note from his hand and examined both sides.Director Xiao: \u201cIt\u2019s like this. Recently the school has been\u2026\u2026\u2026.not very clean.\u201dPlease read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen.Qin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe was almost pushed to his limits with this \u2018squeezing toothpaste\u2019-like questioning but he held himself back and asked patiently: \u201cWhat do you mean not very clean?\u201dThat anxious Teacher Zheng couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He took the lead and answered: \u201cA while back, there were some games popular among the students. You should understand that with all the stress from learning, children tend to like to play these games\u2026\u2026..They\u2019re the types that allow you to make wishes or summon ghosts. Some did it for excitement, others pure curiosity. There are also others who are a little more courageous.\u201d\u201cOh, I have heard a little about it.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cSo what did they summon?\u201dTeacher Zheng broke down: \u201cI don\u2019t know what that thing is. According to the students, it\u2019s something that makes dreams? Or does it steal dreams? In any case, it has something to do with dreams. But that\u2019s not the main issue, the main issue is its power.\u201d\u201cYes, the most problematic is its power.\u201d Director Xiao finally started speaking, \u201cIt is said that it can make dreams come true.\u201d\u201cYou can summon a thing like that?\u201d Qin Jiu raised his eyebrow.Director Xiao: \u201cI also didn\u2019t believe it before but now I really do.\u201d\u201cHow to summon it?\u201d Qin Jiu then asked.Director Xiao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dAre you here to solve the problem or create more problems?Director Xiao felt that this gentleman here seemed to be more eager to try it out than the students.She quickly waved her hand and said: \u201cNo, no, no. The summoning isn\u2019t the problem. The problem is that with so many students making wishes, the whole school is in chaos. Everyone\u2019s dreams are coming true.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that good?\u201d Qin Jiu said jokingly: \u201cUniversity entrance rate 100%\u201dTeacher Zheng couldn\u2019t hold back: \u201cBullshit. It was okay the first two days; there were fewer students slacking off, there weren\u2019t many who believed it, those who did had good dreams and the exam scores really did improve. But how can everyone have good dreams? There would always be a few with nightmares and that\u2019s now becoming the bane of my life.\u201d\u201cI was on night shift that day and stayed in the dormitory\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Teacher Zheng covered his face with both his hands: \u201cMy god, you have no idea what I went through that night. There would be a figure of someone hanging outside the window, half the bed would be covered in blood and there was also something outside constantly scratching at the door.\u201dThe things in the student\u2019s nightmares had also turned into reality and they now roamed the dormitories.They would visit numerous rooms and the next day, half the students would have massive eyebags looking more like a ghost than an actual ghost.\u201cThat day, the school\u2019s counselling room was almost filled to the brim.\u201d A female teacher with short hair said: \u201cI\u2019ve worked here for a long time and the past few days have busied me to the point that I\u2019m starting to doubt my life.Director Xiao said: \u201cNot only Teacher Chen\u2019s counselling room, the medical room and the teacher\u2019s office were all filled with students. Our school is a boarding school, a full boarding school. Students only return once a month, so we are like their parents. The child is scared so they naturally came to find us.\u201dThat day, a large group of students were frightened.After some comforting during the day, everyone felt that they had probably made a commotion over nothing.At night, it once again took shape.\u201cDon\u2019t talk about the students. As for me!\u201d Teacher Zheng said: \u201cI had nightmares one after another at night. All the horror movies I watched since I\u2019ve was young were recalled.\u201dThe counsellor pointed at his eyes and said: \u201cI had insomnia at night. My eyeballs were almost about to sink in.\u201dBecause many more people had nightmares at night, the chaos that took place in the school naturally increased several folds.Like this, it became a vicious cycle.Each night became more terrifying than the previous night.\u201cHave you taken sleeping pills?\u201d Qin Jiu asked.\u201cOf course.\u201d Director Xiao said: \u201cI not only took it myself; I also gave it to the students. In any case, we did everything we could.\u201d\u201cRecently the roads are closed outside, and the school can\u2019t go on break.\u201d She then added: \u201cWhat\u2019s more, no one knows whether this would continue if they\u2019re let out. If it conversely involves the student\u2019s place as well, rumours will circulate, and it would be terrible.\u201dNot far away, the students were led back to the teaching building by the physical education teachers. Although their faces didn\u2019t look great, they were in general still youthful and energetic.Director Xiao said: \u201cThey\u2019re children. They\u2019re always like that. During the day they would eat and run around. Those things don\u2019t come out during the day so at first it might seem okay. Just wait until night comes and you\u2019ll see\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dTeacher Zheng said: \u201cThere were a group of transfer students before. Most of them\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dDirector Xiao shook her head: \u201cIf it goes on like this, our school won\u2019t be able to continue running. Even if we do, we feel bad for the students who are affected. Since the principle invited the two of you over, he should have his reasons. You\u2019ll definitely be able to help, right?\u201dThey\u2019re already here to be punished so how could they say no?So, this was basically a ghost story.The so-called transfer students were probably the batches of examinees. The original \u201cdreams come true\u201d effect that should only affect the examinees had malfunctioned and had now spread over to all the NPCs in the exam\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013And so, demons and monsters rampaged, and hundreds of ghosts wander the night.You Huo held the note between his fingers and said coldly: \u201cPolitics, philosophy.\u201dMaterialism and idealism? Subjectively conjured objects?What a load of nonsense.He then asked Director Xiao: \u201cHow many people in this school?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s probably\u2026\u2026.Since it\u2019s winter vacation make-up classes now, there aren\u2019t many.\u201d Director Xiao answered: \u201cThe first years aren\u2019t here, only the second and third years. Just over a thousand probably.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dA thousand students, a thousand ghosts.Director Xiao said: \u201cThe principal wants us to cooperate with you as much as possible. Let us take you to your arranged accommodation first.\u201dShe waved a student over: \u201cZhang Ming, come here.\u201dIt was a little fatty. His round face was particularly pleasing to look at.This school is currently in need of those with a skill like this to alleviate their fears.Zhang Ming came over: \u201cTeacher, what is it?\u201d\u201cThese two here are guests invited over by the principal. They will stay in the dormitory for the night; the empty room on the sixth floor.\u201dZhang Ming: \u201cOh, the one next to ours?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dDirector Xiao pointed at You Huo: \u201cThis is Teacher A.\u201dThe ones with A in their names before this were all dead. And he was the one who caused it.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dShe then pointed at Qin Jiu: \u201cThis is Teacher B.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.Alright then. It\u2019s at least better than C.\u201d <sup>1 </sup>(KKnotes: Okay, so there\u2019s a slight joke here which I didn\u2019t know how to translate over to English so I kind of muddled my way through it. It\u2019s very minor so it won\u2019t affect your understanding of the novel, but I\u2019ve left an explanation at the end of the chapter for those interested.)Zhang Ming laughed until his eyes were almost gone.Director Xiao got someone to get some essential items for them while the little fatty led them to the dormitory.These two men didn\u2019t think that there would be a day where they would go back and stay overnight in a student dormitory.Zhang Ming had a very lively personality. Perhaps he was extremely accepting but he just found the ghostly incidents to be rather incredible.Qin Jiu asked: \u201cDo you have nightmares?\u201d\u201cI do!\u201dWith the spirit of wanting to gather information, Qin Jiu asked: \u201cOh? What kind of nightmare?\u201dThe little fatty waved his hand and said: \u201cA whole party!\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dA thousand students. It would be funny if there were a thousand partiesPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: 1. Basically, there is another counting system the Chinese use; \u7532, \u4e59, \u4e19, \u4e01\u2026\u2026etc. I used A, B, C, D for the English translation and didn\u2019t feel the need to explain it before. (tbh it\u2019s probably not that important but I\u2019ll just explain it. Feel free to ignore if you want) Hunter A from the first exam and the villagers from the second exam were named using this counting system, while the alphabet A was used for Invigilator A (You Huo). Now in this round, they are called Teacher A and Teacher B using the former counting system so when You Huo was given the alias Teacher A, he thought of the dead hunter and villagers who had similar names\u2026.But anyway, what I wanted to clarify was what Qin Jiu said. What Qin Jiu actually said here was \u201cIt\u2019s at least better than \u2018bing\u2019\u201d. Now, third value in the counting system is \u4e19 \u201cbing\u201d but the word Qin Jiu used here was \u997c \u201cbing\u201d which has the same pronunciation. \u997c can refer to cake/pancake/pastry etc so here Qin Jiu was basically joking that he\u2019s at least better than cake. Again, it\u2019s a very minor detail so it won\u2019t affect the story much.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Essay analysis, question analysis, and practising difficult exercises were among the tasks they needed to do.As soon as the little fatty Zhang Ming entered the classroom, he immediately turned silent and obediently returned to his seat.\u201cHere, pass it back. Do these two readings and we\u2019ll go through it in the next class.\u201d Chinese teacher Yu Luo stood on the podium, divided her stack of papers into six smaller piles and gave it to the first desk on each row.To avoid students pairing up to chat, the desks in the classroom were single desks; one for each student. You Huo looked around. There are 46 students in this class. There were two seats vacant at the end of one of the rows.As soon as Qin Jiu and he entered the classroom, they caught everyone\u2019s attention. The little brats stretched their necks out and quietly whispered to their neighbouring seats.\u201cWho are these two?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.

It\u2019s obvious isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cGhost catching?\u201d\u201cCapturing the great god?\u201d\u201cThey look like this?!\u201dThese were the boys.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dThese were the girls.They didn\u2019t speak and just grabbed a nearby female student\u2019s arm and shook it like crazy. It was enough with just their expression and eyes alone. They didn\u2019t even need to move their lips to communicate.There was obvious tacit understanding.You Huo sauntered over to an empty seat and sat down.Qin Jiu sat behind him.Although the seats these two sat at were empty, there were books and pencil cases on the desk. Perhaps it belonged to students who originally sat there but they were unable to come because they were injured.Those brats used the excuse of passing the paper behind to steal a few more glances.Yu Luo cleared her throat at the podium. The brats quickly turned back, but their eyes continued to glance back.It made her both angry and amused.She internally thought that if they wouldn\u2019t have nightmares if they looked at handsome men, the principal should past their photos all over the school.But unfortunately, that was impossible.Short term stimulation like this wouldn\u2019t achieve this effect. She understood these rascals very well.Sure enough, the students very quickly calmed back down and went back to struggling with their papers.Only the girl at the very back of the row was still blushing.She placed the extra paper on You Huo\u2019s desk and quietly glanced at him and Qin Jiu before asking softly: \u201cDo you want it?\u201dWithout waiting for You Huo\u2019s answer, she threw out a word \u201chere\u201d, and quickly turned back around.The papers stopped there at You Huo. It wasn\u2019t passed back.Afterall, these were for the students. They didn\u2019t need it.You Huo casually flipped through the paper and glanced at the article.Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen.Following the suggestions from the counsellor, Yu Luo had specially picked out two witty articles. On one end, it helped with distracting the students. On the other hand, it could also ease the atmosphere at night.Despite the good intentions, it was hard to tell whether it would work on these students.You Huo skimmed through the article. No one in the classroom spoke.The cold, white light shone down from above\u2026\u2026.In the silence, someone tapped his back with their finger.It was very light, and a little ticklish.You Huo\u2019s lowered eyes moved a little but his gaze still remained on the paper.After a while, he leaned back. With his back against Qin Jiu\u2019s desk, he turned his head slightly.He waited for Qin Jiu to speak.But several seconds passed and it was only silence behind him. Not a word was spoken.You Huo turned his head and looked back.He saw Qin Jiu sitting back against his chair with one hand resting on the table spinning a pen.His gaze was on You Huo\u2019s side profile. For a moment, he seemed to be lost in thought.But the moment You Huo turned his head, he returned to his senses.In the classroom, a student murmured quietly. There was also someone borrowing lead refills and correction pens. It was all done quietly.The sound of pens scratching against the paper became background noise.Qin Jiu stared at You Huo like this for a few seconds before raising his chin and saying: \u201cSuddenly forgot what I wanted to say. You can continue.\u201dYou Huo glanced at him. His back was still against the edge of the table.This time, there was no student mumbling. The classroom was quiet again.He didn\u2019t speak. After a while, he turned back.Before the pen in Qin Jiu\u2019s hand could spin a complete circle, You Huo suddenly raised his hand and passed a paper back onto Qin Jiu\u2019s desk.In addition to the printed questions, there were two additional handwritten marks.One was in the name box. Someone had filled in \u201cPerson B\u201d.The other was on the lines for the first question. There was an additional sentence \u2013 The student in front is Han Ling.The little fatty\u2019s enthusiasm was helpful. It at least gave them some information.This includes things he didn\u2019t dare tell the teachers.For example\u2026\u2026..This summoning dream game actually originated from their class. The first to play it was Han Ling.She had dug out an old book from the library. Its pages were yellowed, and you couldn\u2019t tell which century it was from. The price of it was 0.36 yuan. One could tell with just a brief look that it was a very appropriate book for superstitions.Students of this age have very strong curiosity. This was particularly so for spiritual and supernatural things.Han Ling took a photo of the contents and brought along three friends to give it a try.Perhaps it was because she had something weighing on her mind and it was consequently reflected in her dream. At that time she just happened to have lost an expensive pen of hers and that night she dreamt that she had found it. When she woke up halfway through the night, the pen was next to her pillowSomething like this happening in the middle of the night was actually very scary.At that moment, rather than feeling happy, Han Ling was startled awake.According to the little fatty, that night Han Ling didn\u2019t dare move a single inch. She stared stiffly at the pen for more than two hours and only had the courage to sit up when her roommate got out of bed to go to the bathroom.That night, her and her roommate didn\u2019t go back to sleep. They spent the entire time staring at the pen.The next day, news of the game began to spread.From one to ten, ten to a hundred, the source of the news eventually couldn\u2019t be tracked.With something so terrible happening afterwards, they were even less willing to mention it.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026You Huo and Qin Jiu chose to stay in the classroom with the intention to have a chat with this Han Ling.Qin Jiu looked at the thin scrawls on the paper, stopped spinning his pen and wrote a reply under that line.Two seconds later, You Huo\u2019s back was poked again.The paper that was folded several times was passed across his shoulder and fell onto his desk.Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen.When You Huo opened it, he saw Qin Jiu\u2019s reply \u2014\u2014\u2014 Teacher A, as far as I can see, there are six students in front of you. Are you referring to the little girl who blushed after looking at you?You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dAlthough he knew it was a ridicule, for some reason those words didn\u2019t sound right.You Huo\u2019s lips moved a little. Holding his pen, he looked at it expressionlessly for a while. He then dropped the pen and decided not to respond.***In a blink of an eye, the class was over.As soon as the bell rang, the students seemingly came to life.The sounds of zippers zipping, papers being folded, and chatter suddenly filled the room.It was like a large group of bees was suddenly released.Some of the students remained sitting in their seats looking at the two visitors as they discussed about their fear for the night.But the braver students immediately came over and began to ask questions.You Huo didn\u2019t speak much. With him only spitting out a few words after all that questioning, he clearly gave off a vibe that he was difficult to get along with.Qin Jiu on the other hand would joke around as he subtly probed around for information.The young girl Han Ling couldn\u2019t control herself. Perhaps it was because she was affected by their attractiveness and her mind became muddled.Despite normally unwilling to say anything, she immediately spilled everything when facing You Huo and Qin Jiu.And so, they learned that\u2026\u2026At first, this dream coming true thing involved a small number of people. It really worked, and the effect even lasted throughout the day.Later, as it spread and more people became affected; to the point that the entire school was trapped, the dream coming true effect had changed and the time it could last also shortened.It would only take effect at about 2 o\u2019clock at night. A group of demons and ghosts would create ruckus for a few hours and would then disappear with sunrise.The living creatures dreamt would materialise, but the setting wouldn\u2019t necessarily appear.Some clearer objects such as tables and chairs would appear the same as the dream but big items like high-rise buildings, expressways etc wouldn\u2019t appear. Perhaps it was because the cities in the dreams are only vague backgrounds and not very clear.As for the one thing they were most concerned about, Han Ling also mentioned it.That is \u2014\u2013 What should be done to be considered as cleaning?Han Ling secretly showed them the photo she took because that book had already disappeared from the library.In the photo, there was a certain paragraph. If you translated it into human words, it was:If they can completely remove all the materialised monsters and ghosts from the school before sunrise, the \u201cdream come true\u201d effect would be gone from then on.In other words, they can only leave this place after cleaning up everything in this school in that short four-hour time frame.This condition was rather terrible.But no matter how terrible it was, it didn\u2019t affect You Huo\u2019s sleep.That night, he fell asleep just after 10.And then, he was instantly slapped in the face. Strangely enough, he dreamt of a scene\u2026\u2026\u2026Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Bonus chapter will be out soon after this one!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The interior was mainly composed of a mixture of white and dark blue and grey colours. It was simple and clean.You Huo dreamt of himself walking down the stairs\u2026\u2026\u2026This place was very strange.It wasn\u2019t the place he stayed at temporarily when he was abroad, nor was it any place he had stayed at in China.It wasn\u2019t the hospital, it wasn\u2019t the military academy nor was it Old Yu and Yu Wen\u2019s place\u2026\u2026..In short, it wasn\u2019t a place he recognised.But as he stood there, he had a both familiar yet unfamiliar feeling\u2014\u2014\u2014He seemed to know which corner he should turn at, seemed to know which room he was going to and seemed to know the structure of this house.Every move of his was as if he was the owner of this place. Everything felt familiar.But he didn\u2019t feel any sense of belonging from this, so it was also unfamiliar.He guessed that this was probably where had he lived when he was Invigilator A.This house should be located somewhere in the invigilators district, and he didn\u2019t like this place.But that was also normal. Who would think of a place like this as their home?It was getting dark outside. The sun had set.On one side, there were large French windows on both the first and second floor. Every time You Huo turned to that corner, the lights outside would dazzle his eyes.Through the glass and with the aid of the lights, he could see that it was snowing outside.Clearly the sun had only just set but the snow was falling very heavily\u2026\u2026He squinted to block the light, but his steps didn\u2019t stop at the first floor.The You Huo in the dream somehow knew that he was heading for the basement\u2026\u2026..***This was a day from many years ago. Night had just come, and snow was falling ceaselessly outside.The temperature in the house was just right; just a single shirt was enough.Invigilator A had just returned from a trip outside and had accumulated a layer of snow on his shoulder.He took off his coat and went upstairs to hang it up in his bedroom. Just as he was about to take a shower, there were suddenly sounds coming from downstairs.This was the place of residence the system had arranged for the invigilators. It was a group of identical villas.To the left of the villa\u2019s were the twin towers used for punishing examinees and to the right was a makeshift park that was usually very quiet.And so, the sounds downstairs were rather abrupt.Invigilator A lived alone. He didn\u2019t like to invite friends over so there would rarely be other people at his place.But the last two days were an exception\u2014\u2014\u2014A rule violating examinee called Qin Jiu was also staying there.Of course, he didn\u2019t stay in a bedroom and was instead confined in a confinement room.The system didn\u2019t allow rule violating examinees to live too comfortably.The sounds downstairs stopped for a moment before starting again.They weren\u2019t sounds created by one\u2019s voice, it was a gentle knocking sound. It tapped on unhurriedly.You could tell just from the sound that the person doing the knocking did it with a joking intent.Invigilator A listened to it for a moment and followed the stairs down to the basement.According to the original villa design, the basement was supposed to be a leisure area and it also had a guest room. But to accommodate Qin Jiu, the system had changed that guest room into a confinement room.Except for its lack of monitoring cameras, it was exactly the same as a normal confinement room.The knocking sounds came from inside the confinement room.He scanned his finger and opened the door.There wasn\u2019t much in the confinement room. A set of table and chair and a bed against the wall was all the furniture it had.Some equipments hung from the walls pretentiously.At this moment, Qin Jiu who was still an examinee was sitting on the edge of the bed.The lights from the corridor outside projected into the room and just happened to fall onto Qin Jiu.He squinted his eyes, turned his head away from the light and raised his hands that were tied together by some rope.Past his open palm, you could see a lazy grin hanging from the corner of his mouth.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Invigilator A asked as he leaned against the door.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cI heard a particular Big Invigilator return and just wanted to give my greetings.\u201dHe squinted his eyes again, still unable to adapt to the excessively bright light.Invigilator A glanced back at the corridor light and used the back of his hand to close the door of the confinement room.He closed it very forcefully causing it to let out a \u201cbang\u201d. He clearly did it reluctantly.The room suddenly darkened.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you using the light?\u201d Invigilator A asked coldly.Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen.He slapped the switch and a light somewhere in the corner turned on. Compared to the light in the corridor, it was much dimmer.\u201cOh, I wanted to use it.\u201d Qin Jiu raised his hands and said: \u201cBut unfortunately, I was tied up like this by someone so moving around is inconvenient. The person who tied me also spent half the day outside without leaving me with any food or water. If I didn\u2019t take the initiative to greet you, you would\u2019ve probably forgotten about me\u2026\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t you think this punishment is too excessive Big Invigilator?\u201dAs far as everyone knew, Invigilator A was the youngest of all the invigilators.So young, that it was quite surprising.However, both examinees and his colleagues would subconsciously overlook his age because he was too strong. In the system, he held a very a high status.Qin Jiu alone was an exception.The first time this examinee saw Invigilator A, he unfearfully ridiculed him.After learning that Invigilator A was younger than himself by two years, he added a \u201cbig\u201d in front of his title and would call him \u201cBig Invigilator\u201d left and right.This name would have been okay if it was someone else calling it.In fact, there were also some invigilators who used this as a way of showing respect to his head invigilator status.But when it came from Qin Jiu\u2019s mouth, it carried a hint of casual teasing.Invigilator A glanced at the clock and said: \u201cI went out for work at 4pm. It is now 6:10pm.\u201dA total of 2 hours and 10 minutes. You have the nerve to say that it\u2019s half the day?As for not giving him any food or water, that is all bullshit!He coldly snorted and pushed the glass and plate on the table: \u201cIs this pig food?\u201dOf course, it wasn\u2019t pig food. The food was exquisite, and very expensive.It was something another invigilator got from a restaurant in the commercial area. It was given to him as a form of apology for some things that had happened during the day.He wasn\u2019t hungry so he threw them into the confinement room.But this examinee didn\u2019t appreciate it.Qin Jiu stretched his legs and changed it into a more relaxed posture. He lifted his eyelids and scanned over the food disinterested: \u201cIt\u2019s different from last night.\u201dInvigilator A: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe food last night was very good. The taste was unique.\u201d Qin Jiu continued: \u201cThe prawns were a little burnt but other than that it was very good.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dInvigilator A expressionlessly pulled a nearby bin over and poured out the water and meat: \u201cYou chose this. Just starve then.\u201dHe leaned against the edge of the table and poured out the already cold dinner before throwing the dishes back onto the tableTwo sets of clatters sounded in the confinement room and then it was quiet again.For a moment, there was only the sound of the two of them breathing.With his arms crossed, Invigilator A eyelids lowered, and his gaze fell onto Qin Jiu.Silence would always carry a sense of confrontation.This confrontation continued quietly for a moment before Invigilator A finally spoke up: \u201cWith you violating the rules so many times, what is your purpose?\u201dQin Jiu raised his eyebrow: \u201cDo I need to have a purpose to violate the rules?\u201dInvigilator A didn\u2019t speak.Qin Jiu then said: \u201cIsn\u2019t the purpose of this examination to select the right candidates? As far as I know, it should be like this. The questions are quite difficult. I couldn\u2019t think of a perfect way to clear it so I could only use alternative means. If there are better methods, why would I violate the rules? Who isn\u2019t afraid of punishment?\u201dInvigilator A: \u201cThat\u2019s enough nonsense from you. You can stop there.\u201dQin Jiu laughed.He laughed for a moment and said: \u201cI\u2019m being serious. Don\u2019t you believe me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201dQin Jiu made a regretful expression. Just the sight of it made one have the urge to beat him up.\u201cThe first time you cleaned the examination centre, you buried a radio jammer.\u201d\u201cThe third time you cleaned the examination centre, you led the exam subjects into a logical mess. When the examination centre was later put into use, it broke down halfway. Even now, it has not been successfully repaired.\u201dInvigilator A listed them one by one.Qin Jiu however wasn\u2019t anxious when he heard this. He just said bluntly: \u201cIt\u2019s just a prank.\u201dInvigilator A: \u201cThe fifth time, you said you lost a re-examination card.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cThat forest looked the same everywhere. It might have fallen out when I pulled out the compass. I remember mentioning it to you at that time?\u201dInvigilator A paused: \u201cAnd last time, you hid a cheat sheet.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cI enjoy helping others.\u201dInvigilator A stopped talking.His light-coloured eyes that reflected the light looked even lighter than it already was. He stared quietly at Qin Jiu.Qin Jiu also looked back at him. He didn\u2019t try to avoid his gaze.After a moment, Invigilator A removed his gaze. His eyes swept around the room before falling over onto the floor lamp.A few seconds passed before he suddenly spoke up: \u201cForget it. I\u2019ll just say one last thing.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cWhat is it? Go ahead.\u201d\u201cI had countless opportunities to interrogate you, but I chose to do it here. Do you know why?\u201dQin Jiu thought about it and said: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dInvigilator A: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dQin Jiu took in his expression and suddenly laughed: \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll answer seriously. It\u2019s because this is a confinement room.\u201dInvigilator A\u2019s eyes flickered: \u201cSo you know.\u201d\u201cI just happened to have heard a rumour.\u201d\u201cThat the confinement room is the only place that is not under the system\u2019s control. This is the only place left from the original settings and is considered a safe haven from the rules.\u201dQin Jiu paused and then said: \u201cI also heard that this safe haven didn\u2019t exist before this year. Someone had proposed to the system that its practice wasn\u2019t in compliance with the rules and after that the confinement room was exempted from its control.\u201dInvigilator A heard this and said: \u201cWho did you hear it from?\u201dPlease read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen.Qin Jiu: \u201cThose who have investigated, those who have participated, those who just happened to know.\u201dThis answer was equivalent to a confession of some sort.Invigilator A remained silent for a while. He then said: \u201cSo you did come with a mission. And then you had your eyes on me.\u201dThis should have been an interrogative statement, but he spoke very calmly.Qin Jiu: \u201cInvigilator A has a special relationship with the system. This was the information I got. If I didn\u2019t give you special treatment, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s too unreasonable?\u201dInvigilator A coldly snorted. It could be considered an answer from him.This reaction of his seemed to please the examinee. He stared at Invigilator A for a long time and said: \u201cWhen I first saw you, I felt that you were on the system\u2019s side. Like all the engineers and personnel involved, you had your head buried in the sand like an ostrich; covering your eyes and ears so that you can pretend not to have noticed the system\u2019s problem. Afterall, it would be the ones who try to interfere who would be in trouble if it can no longer be controlled.\u201d\u201cBut I later realised that it didn\u2019t seem to be the case.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cBut you\u2019re too difficult to read. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s because you\u2019re good at acting or if it was because of reasons on my end, I have never been able to determine your position. In fact, even just now I was a little swayed.\u201dInvigilator A looked at him through the corner of his eyes. As usual, he spoke unenthusiastically: \u201cAnd now?\u201d\u201cNow? Let\u2019s change it up a little.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cCan you tell me something straightwordly Big Invigilator? I have been trying to guess your thoughts for a long time\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe paused for a moment and then said: \u201cIf I continue guessing, I\u2019ll soon start doubting my identity.\u201d\u201cIdentity? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cDo you know what kind of relationship involves guessing the other person\u2019s thoughts?\u201dInvigilator A looked at him and didn\u2019t speak.Qin Jiu also didn\u2019t speak.Silence once again spread through the room.Invigilator A suddenly spoke up: \u201cThe confinement room exemption, I did that. Is that straightforward enough?\u201dQin Jiu\u2019s eyes were bright. He said: \u201cForget it, it\u2019s barely okay.\u201dInvigilator A glanced at the time again. He finally got up.Qin Jiu only now realised that he hadn\u2019t taken off his military boots. He probably still needed to go out again.\u201cYou can slowly bear with it then.\u201d He said this as he headed for the door.Qin Jiu\u2019s voice rang from behind him: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to untie me?\u201dInvigilator A\u2019s footsteps stopped. He answered expressionlessly: \u201cYou can obviously undo it in one minute. Do you really need to pretend to be so pitiful?\u201dBehind him, a chuckle sounded. This was followed by the rustling of ropes.\u201cAlright then, but there\u2019s something you\u2019re wrong about\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201dInvigilator A didn\u2019t look back.Just as he reached the door, someone appeared behind him.\u201c\u2014\u2014\u2014-It actually only takes a few seconds.\u201dQin Jiu stood behind him and was about to say something, but he suddenly stretched his thumb out and rubbed it against the side of his neck: \u201cYour collar is a little damp. Is it raining outside?\u201dSensation of that touch was both warm and dry.Invigilator A held the door handle and didn\u2019t move. Only his eyes narrowed slightly.After a while, he said: \u201cNo, it\u2019s snowing.\u201d***At this moment, You Huo suddenly woke up.Like those occasional dreams he had the past few years, the moment he woke up, the contents of his dream became too fuzzy and vague to remember.He could only quickly grasp onto little bits and pieces left behind.You Huo could only remember that there seemed to be Qin Jiu in his dream, as well as a rope and a room.But he couldn\u2019t remember the details.Somewhere outside, there were a few knocking sounds. They were dull knocks.You Huo sat up from his bed and pinched the bridge of his nose to ease off his sleepiness.But after pinching his bridge a few times, he suddenly felt that something wasn\u2019t right.Dreams come true, dreams come true. If he really dreamed of Qin Jiu, then wouldn\u2019t that mean\u2014\u2014-You Huo quickly opened his eyes.The first thing he saw was Qin Jiu in the bed opposite his. He had also just woken up and was a little confused.Soon afterwards, he silently turned his head. There were now extra people in the dormitory\u2014\u2014-Not far from his bed, a man with his hands tied up with rope was sitting lazily on the desk.And next to Qin Jiu who had just woken up, there was a man wearing a shirt, trousers, and military boots leaning against the balcony door. With his arms crossed and his eyes half-lowered, he coldly watched them.A badge was attached to his upper right arm. On it were the words \u201cInvigilator A\u201d engraved.It was clear who dreamt of who.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe atmosphere in the room was extremely stiff.

No one spoke up.But unfortunately, there were two others in the room that aren\u2019t human.The one bound with rope broke the silence: \u201cWhat kind of game is this?\u201dHe then paused. His eyes scanned over the person standing by the balcony door with an Invigilator A arm badge and he then looked over at You Huo.After looking back and forth a few more times, he finally made a choice\u2014\u2014\u2013Sitting on the desk, he leaned forward with one foot in the chair. He raised his hands and said to You Huo who was sitting in bed: \u201cShouldn\u2019t you untie me first Big Invigilator?\u201dBig Invigilator\u2026\u2026That title gave a big blow to everyone.After he finished speaking, the atmosphere was even worse.Invigilator A standing by the balcony had his lips pursed even tighter.The invigilator Qin Jiu sitting in bed narrowed his eyes and had a slightly complicated expression. Even he himself didn\u2019t know why he felt displeased.You Huo\u2019s expression was the most stiff out of everyone present.This clearly proved that he had dreamt of himself tying Qin Jiu up, but he didn\u2019t know what it was for.How honourable.Just as the silence was about to linger even longer, Qin Jiu broke it.He pointed his chin at himself from several years ago and said: \u201cI\u2019m confused. Do you really need help untying that?\u201dThe examinee sitting on the desk tilted his head and looked over casually: \u201cNot necessarily, it depends on the mood. But my friend, did you ask for my permission before disguising yourself as me?\u201dQin Jiu laughed briefly. It was hard to tell how much of it was amusement and how much of it was mockery.The tied up \u201cQin Jiu\u201d also laughed.He twisted his wrist and in a blink of an eye, the rope loosened. The rope now sat in his hands like a toy.He unhurriedly straightened the ends of the rope.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dWith how everything was going, it if developed further, they might need to fight first.This was different to their expectations\u2014\u2014-Those students had explained to them: \u201cThe dream would only materialise superficial things. It has no soul.\u201d\u201cFor example, you dreamt that you were on a date with someone. In the dream, the other party smiled a lot and has a good temper. The person who materialises will also be someone who smiled a lot and has a good temper. They will only show those two sides. You won\u2019t find a third personality trait from them.\u201d\u201cAnd here\u2019s another example. You dreamt that you were on a date with that person again. In that dream, that person said to you that they had poor grades in elementary school and only played around. When first year of middle school came, they suddenly came to a realisation and started working hard! The background of the person who materialises will only be limited to this. What happened after that? What about high school? University? They wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cIf you dream of monsters eating human, it would always eat humans. If you dream of a female ghost hiding under the bed, that female ghost would always hide under the bed. It\u2019s pretty much like this.\u201dThose little brats explained with great detail.You Huo and Qin Jiu surmised from this that the so-called dream come true was essentially a group of replicas with generally low IQ and EQ.Whatever you think it is like, it would be like that.But the tied up \u201cQin Jiu\u201d before them wasn\u2019t like that.The same was true for the arm badge wearing \u201cInvigilator A\u201d.***The scene in the room with four pairs of eyes staring at each other made \u201cInvigilator A\u201d a little confused and also a little impatient.He leaned against the door frame and continued to watch on as a spectator. He had the same habit as You Huo and would rub his earlobe when he is distracted or in thought. The only difference was that he didn\u2019t have an earring.In a tense setting like this, \u201cInvigilator A\u201d also wasn\u2019t someone to underestimate.This was something You Huo knew very well.He didn\u2019t know what Qin Jiu had dreamt of to magnify this \u201cunable to underestimate\u201d side of him so much.\u201cGive me an explanation. Is this a bug or an exam effect?\u201d\u201cInvigilator A\u201d\u2019s eyes scanned across the two Qin Jiu\u2019s before falling over onto You Huo.As he spoke, his hand moved to touch his waist. It was as it he would beat them down on the spot if anyone was to say the wrong thing.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe actually understood.With the premise that he had no knowledge of the context, seeing someone identical to you standing in before you\u2026\u2026..Being happy about it was impossible.In any case, if it wasn\u2019t a demon, it would be a ghost.With his character, he had already done his best not beating the other party to show their true form.As someone who knew what was going on, You Huo for once squeezed out some patience to explain: \u201cExam effect.\u201d\u201cContinue.\u201d \u201cInvigilator A\u201d wearing the arm badge said.\u201cA dream coming true effect. In this examination centre, everything you dream of will materialise.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cSlept and dreamt some things so you guys appeared.\u201dYou Huo\u2019s patience was gradually running out.\u201cInvigilator A\u201d said indifferently: \u201cSo you two are real, and we\u2019re fake?\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201d\u201cHow to prove?\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cInvigilator A\u201d said: \u201cI think I am real, you think you are. How do you prove it?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dForget it, let\u2019s just fight.It won\u2019t be so difficult to explain once you\u2019ve beaten them.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.***It is currently 2:23am at night. The boarding high school had turned into hell.Han Ling huddled in her bed with her blanket pulled up so that it reached just below her nose, leaving only room for her to breath.She didn\u2019t dare move. She listened to the muffled noises coming from the wall\u2014\u2014Thud\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Thud\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Thud\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014It sounded like something heavy hanging outside. Swaying with the wind, it would hit the wall again and again.Even the bed she was on shook with each impact.She knew what that was.She would always remember her dreams especially clearly\u2014\u2014\u2013It was a dead man hanging outside. With his body covered with a sack that\u2019s tightened around his neck, only his deathly pale head was revealed.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netThat thudding sound was the sound of his head knocking against the wall.After experiencing it so many times, she would still tremble with fright every night.She huddled in her bed and trembled for five minutes when she heard the wall cracking.She thought: \u201cIt\u2019s game over today. Might not be able to escape this time.\u201dAfter a few cracking sounds, parts of the white wall started to chip.Han Ling finally could no longer hold it back. She let out an ear-piercing scream and instantly rushed out from her bed.Her long hair was a mess, and she didn\u2019t bother with changing out of her red pyjamas.Dragging her roommate, they both rushed out the door and ran into another long haired girl wearing red.\u201cAHH\u2014\u2014-\u201d\u201cAHH\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dTwo screams sounded at the same time. The sounds of hasty footsteps filled the building.As soon as they released their vocal cords, it kicked off the start of the school\u2019s nightlife.The more people there were, the richer the variety.One by one, students rushed out from their rooms and formed small clusters.On the wall, a large hole suddenly broken open. A deathly pale face looked into the hole and its big round eyes stared unrelentingly at the dormitory room.There was an eight-limbed monster chasing people with its axes. There was also a female ghost missing her lower half of her body dragging herself along the corridor with just her hands.Screams sounded from the bathroom one after another.At some point in time, the ceiling was missing a board. Through that dark hole, there as something quietly looking down at the people below.Sometimes long hair would fall from above. Sometimes blurred faces would appear from the gaps between the doors.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.The sports field had long been turned upside down from the chaos. It looked like an abandoned mass grave.Old, weathered tombstones were erected all over the place. Graves from who knows what century had been split in half and there were openings on the coffin lids.All kinds of deaths, all kinds of ghosts.There were also zombies, beasts, monsters\u2026\u2026..There were ones as big as Godzilla, and there were ones as small as insects, but they were all equally deadly.These students would dream of almost anything. Even the ants try to drill into people\u2019s eyes and brains instead of carrying their food home.There was even someone who dreamt of a natural disaster.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026***With a loud boom\u2014\u2014\u2013The entire dormitory building shook for a moment. Bookcases fell, water spilled everywhere and the fluorescent lights up above had half fallen off.The little fatty Zhang Ming desperately dragged his roommate out the door. As he dragged him, he shouted: \u201cHurry!! RUNNN\u201dHis body wasn\u2019t in good shape, but his speed was very fast. He sped off like a pinball.This pinball rolled straight over to the staircase before remembering something and rolling back.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d His roommate shouted.\u201cNext door! I\u2019ll take a look next door\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dThis little fatty strongly favoured heroic plotlines. Even in a situation like this, he went against the current and squeezed over to a dormitory room door.He raised his fist and got ready to knock.Just as he knocked once, the door opened on its own.He stumbled in.\u201cHurry up and go!! Why are you\u2014\u2014\u2013huh?\u201d He almost ran into the balcony but was stopped by someone\u2019s foot. Another person also grabbed him by the back of his shirt.The person who stopped him was sitting by the window. He remembered Director Xiao\u2019s introduction, it was Teacher B.He turned his head and looked. The person holding the back of his shirt also looked familiar\u2026\u2026\u2026It was also Teacher B!The little fatty\u2019s mouth opened with surprise. He looked in front and then looked behind him again. He thought he might have seen wrong.Soon afterwards, he realised that there were also two Teacher A\u2019s in the room\u2026\u2026\u2026The little fatty remained stunned for a few seconds before returning to his senses. He realised that it was probably caused by the dreams.***You Huo and Qin Jiu, the two\u2026\u2026\u2026no, four people in the end didn\u2019t start fighting.It was because the school was on the verge of collapsing. The monsters and demons had started their nightly rampage.They briefly set their differences aside and decided to resolve the problem first before resuming their discussion.The examinee \u201cQin Jiu\u201d sat on the windowsill with his legs crossed. He lowered his eyes, looked out and reported the current situation: \u201cA group of monkeys\u2026\u2026Can\u2019t see clearly what it is but let\u2019s just say they\u2019re monkeys.\u201d\u201cGet to the main point.\u201d\u201cInvigilator A\u201d also pulled out a weapon and jumped out the window onto the balcony.\u201cThe main point is, that group of monkeys just passed by five metres below me and is now gnawing at the wall.\u201d\u201cGnawing what wall?\u201d\u201cThe wall literally.\u201dExaminee \u201cQin Jiu\u201d pointed down and said: \u201cThere. Gnawing on it like meat. If it continues, the building will collapse.\u201d\u201cInvigilator A\u201d flipped onto a platform nearby.This dormitory had a platform on the roof that used to be open to students to air out their blankets, but it was later locked up in fear of students jumping off.As \u201cInvigilator A\u201d stood on the narrow edge of that platform, his tall, lean figure reflected the swaying lights from within the dormitory building.Because of their daring and fluid actions, the little fatty was dumbfounded.Against the night, the examinee \u201cQin Jiu\u201d turned his head and said to \u201cInvigilator A\u201d: \u201cCan you stand steadily? I don\u2019t mind going down to catch you.\u201d\u201cJust be concerned about yourself.\u201dThe examinee let out an \u201coh\u201d and then said to the two in the room: \u201cWhat do you need to clean?\u201dQin Jiu pointed out the window with his chin: \u201cAll of them.\u201dThe Qin Jiu\u2019s from two different stages in life looked at each other for a moment. Even the angle of their smirk was exactly the same.The examinee \u201cQin Jiu\u201d pointed at the \u201cInvigilator A\u201d on the platform and said: \u201cWe\u2019re a team, you\u2019re a team. Let\u2019s see who\u2019s faster.\u201dAs soon as he was done saying that, he turned and jumped out.Little fatty: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe stared blankly out the window and then stared blankly at Qin Jiu and You Huo: \u201cHe left.\u201dAfter pausing for a few seconds, he said with an even more shocked expression: \u201cThis is the sixth floor\u2026\u2026..\u201dQin Jiu let out an \u201coh\u201d: \u201cIt\u2019s a little dangerous.\u201dLittle fatty: \u201c???\u201dThe word \u201ca little\u201d shouldn\u2019t be used this way.When he turned his head back, the handsome man on the platform was also gone.The little fatty gulped.He finally realised that he may not have gone against the current to be a young hero\u2026\u2026.He had come here to be a bear. (KKnotes: I\u2019m not too sure what \u2018being a bear (\u5f53\u718a)\u2019 meant. From what I can gather, it refers to someone who mindlessly throws themselves in dangers way?? Maybe??)BOOOOMMM\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013A loud sound projected throughout the dormitory building.It was as if a large whip had whipped against the building causing the entire building to rock violently. The roof and floors began to collapse.\u201cHurry and go!!\u201d The little fatty shouted.\u201cNo rush.\u201d Qin Jiu said.\u201cI\u2019m in a rush!!! You guys should be in a rush too! Hurry!\u201dOn the side, You Huo pulled off the curtains.He shattered the window with two kicks, tied the curtains together, secured it with the rope left by the examinee \u201cQin Jiu\u201d and tested its sturdiness.Qin Jiu looked at him with surprise: \u201cYou need this?\u201dYou Huo kicked the little fatty\u2019s back: \u201cHe does.\u201dThe little fatty was in complete panic.You Huo threw the other end of the curtain to Qin Jiu.Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen.Qin Jiu held the little fatty down and secured the curtain around him: \u201cWhat big parade did you dream about today?\u201dThe little fatty howled out amidst the shaking and sounds of the building collapsing: \u201cI don\u2019t know! I forgot!! A Jurassic war against zombies that caused an earthquake or something\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dHalfway through his speech, he was bound securely by the curtain and was placed onto the windowsill by Qin Jiu.\u201cIt might be a little thrilling later.\u201d Qin Jiu comforted the little fatty and said: \u201cBut if we don\u2019t do this, you won\u2019t make it out in time.\u201dThe dormitory building started to crumble.You Huo squatted on the windowsill with one hand supporting himself using the empty window frame.He lowered his eyes and made eye contact with Qin Jiu.Ever since they were startled awake in the middle of the night, this was their first time looking at each other.Both expressions for a moment were a little complicated.Qin Jiu said: \u201cNow that outsiders are not around, I want to ask you something during this chaos.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026..Speak.\u201d\u201cWhen did you know?\u201dHis question was asked without context but You Huo didn\u2019t have any trouble understanding.\u201cNot long ago. Found out at the end of the last exam.\u201d You Huo paused and added: \u201cWhen I was confined.\u201dWhen he was done speaking, he looked at Qin Jiu again.Qin Jiu understood that he was asking him back. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s the same. I also\u2026\u2026.while confined.\u201dFor some reason, he suddenly found it amusing. He even let out a laugh.You Huo turned his head aside. The corner of his lips curved slightly.It was very strange. The lingering awkwardness from earlier was gone in an instant.It was as if it didn\u2019t matter anymore.Qin Jiu still wanted to say something else, but he was interrupted by the little fatty who was wrapped into a cocoon: \u201cI\u2019m still here\u2026\u2026I-I-I didn\u2019t want to interrupt but\u2026\u2026the building\u2019s really about to collapse\u2014\u2014-\u201dYou Huo straightened up.His figure was exactly the same was \u201cInvigilator A\u201d who stood on the platform earlier.No, to be more precise, the \u201cInvigilator A\u201d from the dream was exactly the same as him.He looked out into the night. Greyish white ape-like beasts rushed towards the building in swarms. It attacked the building that was about to collapse, gnawing at the walls and pillars with frenzy.A large chunk of the side wall had already been chewed off.You Huo wound the other end of the rope around his hand and suddenly said to Qin Jiu: \u201cYou can come up.\u201d\u201cOn the count of three.\u201d3, 2, 1.The building crashed. The little fatty screamed.As they jumped down, You Huo could see that Invigilator A not far away had already killed a group of the apes. The metal buckles on his shirt and military boots were especially conspicuous against the night.He suddenly grew curious about the contents of Qin Jiu\u2019s dream.Qin Jiu whispered quietly in the wind: \u201cSome trivial things from long ago.\u201d***Although he said it was from long ago, it wasn\u2019t that long ago. At least, it wasn\u2019t during his time as an examinee.He dreamt of himself when he had already entered and joined the invigilators team. Using his original title Gin, he became Invigilator A\u2019s colleague.At that time, there were a total of fifty invigilators. Each and every one of them had their own personalities and stances. There were often differences in opinions as they discussed the implementation of rules of the examination centre so there would often be quarrels during the meetings.What he dreamt of was one of the usual meetings.As for what they were arguing about at the meeting, he could no longer remember. All the arguments in this dream were endless and incoherent.He only remembered that at this meeting, he and Invigilator A were sitting on opposite ends of the long table. Both with tension in the air, their opinions were always the opposite of each other.They didn\u2019t speak much, but they were clearly representatives of the two opposing factions. As long as one gave the signal to start, the others would quickly jump in and start arguing.There were also several peacemakers who would occasionally try to make peace with Invigilator A and then move to make peace with him.Occasionally, his eyes would meet with Invigilator A\u2019s eyes across the long table.During those moments, those peacemakers would quickly jump in and block it, fearing that their relationship would worsen if they maintained eye contact for too long.During the intermission in the middle, some would go to the bathroom, others would go get coffee or water, but more would stay behind in the conference room to continue discussing.Invigilator A listened to them talk for a while before getting up and leaving.Soon afterwards, Qin Jiu also left.The corridor was very long. Doors that caved in were lined along both sides.Qin Jiu unhurriedly walked down this corridor. As he passed a corner, he suddenly stopped his steps.From the corner of his eyes, he saw Invigilator A leading against one of the doors seemingly looking this way.Qin Jiu\u2019s feet turned. He was about to walk over.Several colleagues just happened to pass by behind him. His shoulder was patted, and a peacemaker said: \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to argue during the meeting. Having a clash in opinion is normal when you\u2019re exchanging ideas but let\u2019s drop it during the breaks shall we? Let\u2019s go, I just happen to have something I want to talk to you about.\u201dHe raised his eyes and saw that not far away; another invigilator had also appeared. Invigilator A turned to speak to that person in his usual cold and indifferent manner.Qin Jiu snorted.In the dream he was a little annoyed.But strangely enough, this negative emotion wasn\u2019t directed at Invigilator A.He felt that the peacemaker next to him was being too nosy, and he also felt that his colleagues were speaking too much and was too noisy.What made him most annoyed was the system\u2019s constant prying\u2026\u2026\u2026.Those people continued to talk non-stop. He kneaded his neck and walked away with the other invigilators.Before leaving, Invigilator A\u2019s light-coloured eyes again turned to look at him.And then he woke up.***The building crashed to the ground. Smoke and dust scattered.The little fatty tumbled across the ground. It just happened to help unwrap him from the curtains. Apart from dizziness and slight pain in his butt, he wasn\u2019t injured.Beside him, You Huo landed cleanly on the ground. He took a moment to recover from the impact.As he moved to straighten up, Qin Jiu just happened to land next to him.He suddenly felt a tug on his earlobe.Qin Jiu\u2019s quiet voice sounded next to his ear: \u201cI have a question that I\u2019ve been wanting to ask for a long time. Why do you wear an earring?\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: \u201cOne tied up, one in uniform, and two in bed\u2026\u2026..\u201dThat sounds dirty \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Day by day, it gets worse.The students in this school are classic examples of this.Inspired by the dreams their classmates dreamt of, the next night their dreams would become even richer.With this, it became a vicious cycle.The most obvious indication for this was \u2014\u2014 Before they were fortunate enough that their rooms weren\u2019t demolished. Today, two entire buildings had collapsed.The male and female dormitories were located opposite each other with a small road in between. There was slight misalignment of the floors to prevent boys from looking into the girl\u2019s balconies.The surrounding fences pointed up towards the sky like an arrow, threatening the mischievous children trying to get in.Normally what they could do was rather limited but now the entire female dormitory had fallen, smashing into the male dormitory.Seeing the groups of girls descending from the sky, the screaming boys instantly became more dignified.Adolescents have a very strong desire to protect. They immediately built up their courage and moved to escort the girls.But within a few minutes, they realised that they may have had a misunderstanding.Those girls were completely different from what they had imagined\u2014\u2014\u2014The ones who were screaming were them. The ones who cried particularly badly were them. The ones who were scrambling around attacking and scratching the ghosts were also them.Several boys who couldn\u2019t dodge in time were mistaken as ghosts and scratched.It was because the girls attacked with their eyes closed.Han Ling was among this group of unlucky girls. She screamed the loudest and fought the hardest.Together with the fallen building, she fell into the male dormitory crying the entire time.As she cried, she ran down the stairs dragging along the hanging ghost by the hair.She fought so fiercely because she was very scared inside.There was no hero coming to save her, she could only save herself.She stumbled down the stairs, kicked aside the ghost and ran off barefoot.She would usually vomit after running 800m during physical education class but now she had probably done that several times and was still able to go on.The school was in chaos. It was impossible to tell where they were.Han Ling ran around the dormitory area in panic and was finally able to get rid of that hanging ghost, but she found herself in the even more terrible sports field instead.One of the coffins was left uncovered and she immediately fell in.The horrid stench of something rotting filled her nose.She felt that her feet could no longer move. Her hand had a large wound and her knees were swollen. Every part of her body hurt.At this moment, she heard rustling sounds above her.She fearfully looked back.Seven or eight zombies circled around the coffin.Their skins were completely rotten. Some of them had eyeballs partially falling out while others only had dark holes for their eyes.The zombies lowered their hands. Gurgling sounds were heard as they seemingly communicated.Without removing their gaze, they continued to stare at her. Saliva formed long thin strands as it fell from their mouths.It\u2019s over. Looks like this time she\u2019s really going to die here.Those zombies slowly stretched out their claws.She tried to shrink back a little further, but she had nowhere to go.This coffin was about to belong to her\u2026\u2026\u2026.She subconsciously closed her eye, but she then heard some cracks.Soon afterwards, it was the sound of something falling. It was very faint.Han Ling built up her courage and opened her eyes. She saw that all the zombies around her had fallen and there were two figures standing near the grave mound; one closer and one a little further away.The one closer to her had an extremely handsome figure. In his hand was a long thin knife that he had procured from somewhere.Han Ling had never seen a knife like this. In any case, it wasn\u2019t like the ones she had seen before.The knife was thin and narrow, and the blade was extremely sharp. It reflected a cold light.The person welding the knife made clean and simple movements. With each blow, a zombie\u2019s head flew off.He seemed to find those heads dirty. After every blow, he would always flick the knife and throw the head far into the distance.Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen.When he was done cutting them down, he turned around allowing Han Ling to finally see his face.She recognised this person. He was the one sitting behind her during evening self-study.Han Ling subconsciously called out: \u201cTeacher A!\u201dOther party: \u201c?\u201dUh\u2026\u2026..When did Teacher A change his boots?Han Ling froze for a moment.Just as she was lost in thought, another wave of zombies rushed over from the other side.Han Ling exclaimed in surprise: \u201cBe careful\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201dAs a result, the figure a little further away from her turned around. With one hand supporting himself using the tombstone, he flipped across the pit.The place he chose to land on was very\u2026\u2026.specific.He landed right next to Teacher A.As soon as he landed, he grabbed Teacher A\u2019s wrist and pulled it over: \u201cBig Invigilator, let me borrow the knife.\u201dAs soon as he was done saying that, the zombie heads also fell to the ground.He had cut six down in one go.The man borrowing the knife was also someone Han Ling recognised.It was the person sitting two seats behind her during evening self-study.Who else could it be if not Teacher B?But\u2026\u2026\u2026.Why was Teacher B\u2019s hair a little shorter?Moreover, why did Teacher B call Teacher A \u201cBig Invigilator\u201d?Han Ling wasn\u2019t given the opportunity to mull over this.She heard Teacher A\u2019s cold voice speak: \u201cThrow it away.\u201d\u201cAs you wish.\u201d Teacher B responded playfully.And then\u2026..Han Ling saw heads fly around.Those two teachers probably threw them quite far.In any case, she could no longer see them.She could only hear the zombie\u2019s cries.As they did this, Teacher A said: \u201cCan\u2019t you find a knife for yourself?\u201dHis tone was very cold. Han Ling felt that if it was her, she probably wouldn\u2019t dare speak back.But Teacher B just laughed. He then responded: \u201cNo time.\u201dUh\u2026\u2026\u2026..I guess it\u2019s true that he didn\u2019t have time.Afterall, they are currently in such a predicament.Han Ling thought this.The next second, a zombie head was picked up and thrown over.It drew an arc and, with its eyes still open, it landed right before Han Ling.She instinctively screamed.As soon as she activated her vocal cords, she heard a rustle.A figure landed by the side of the coffin and a good-looking hand reached over to pick up that head. With a \u201cwhoosh\u201d the head was thrown away.Han Ling opened her eyes and saw Teacher B squatting there. From above, he held up two fingers and casually greeted her: \u201cSorry, were you scared by that?\u201dHan Ling called out: \u201cTeacher B.\u201dOther party: \u201c?\u201dThe handsome man raised his eyebrow.A long time ago, some would call him officer. After that there were people who called him Brother Qin or examinee. It was his first time however to be called Teacher. It was a little strange.\u201cInvigilator A\u201d walked over. He flicked off the blood from the tip of the knife.\u201cCan you stand?\u201d He asked Han Ling.Han Ling nodded.\u201cThis is a school? Is there a place for people to hide?\u201d Examinee \u201cQin Jiu\u201d asked.\u201cThere\u2019s an underground carpark but\u2026\u2026\u2026but there may be ghosts there too.\u201d Han Ling felt that since it was usually quiet and empty, it was the ideal place for ghosts to appear.She was afraid that it was probably the most affected place right now.\u201cDoes it have a door?\u201d\u201cI remember there was a door slot at the entrance. It should be able to be sealed.\u201d Han Ling said: \u201cI heard it was initially made to be a shelter.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s fine then. We can just kill however many ghosts there are.\u201dExaminee \u201cQin Jiu\u201d said this.Han Ling: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dShe couldn\u2019t keep up with this kind of thought process.Han Ling climbed out of the coffin and saw that the entire cemetery had been cleared.She knew there shouldn\u2019t only be this many zombie. The others may have\u2026\u2026uh, been scared away?At least they temporarily wouldn\u2019t come any closer.She said: \u201cI\u2019ll take you to the carpark.\u201dThe little girl walked ahead with a red face.With her back defended by these two, she wasn\u2019t afraid.\u201cQin Jiu\u201d took a few steps before rubbing his fingers and saying: \u201cBig Invigilator, lend me two tissues.\u201d\u201cInvigilator A\u201d glanced at him: \u201cWith what eyes of yours do you see me carrying tissues around?\u201dIt was very strange. He was clearly disgusted when the knife touched the zombies, but he didn\u2019t cut off nor move away from the hand waving next to him that had touched those zombie heads.Han Ling ahead took a few steps and silently passed over a bag of tissues from her pocket.She then silently turned back\u2026\u2026\u2026She didn\u2019t know why but she felt that she shouldn\u2019t say anything right now.Firstly, with two handsome men before her, she was a little shy.And secondly, she just felt\u2026\u2026\u2026that it wasn\u2019t appropriate.\u201cQin Jiu\u201d gave her his thanks and pulled out two pieces to wipe his hands before handing another to \u201cInvigilator A\u201d.\u201cInvigilator A\u201d looked at the tissue but didn\u2019t move to accept it: \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cTo clean the knife. To think that such a picky Invigilator A could carry that zombie-fluid stained knife around for so long.\u201dHearing the words \u201czombie-fluid stained knife\u201d \u201cInvigilator A\u201d expressionlessly reached out and snatched the tissue.The grass below them rustled as they walked through. The sound of tissue rubbing the knife was very faint.For a moment, there were no other sounds.After a while, \u201cQin Jiu\u201d suddenly spoke up: \u201cYou\u2019re unhappy.\u201d\u201cInvigilator A\u201d\u2019s act of cleaning his knife stopped. He then looked at him with a frown: \u201cWho?\u201d\u201cYou.\u201d\u201cInvigilator A\u201d looked back and continued cleaning his knife.\u201cLet me think\u2026\u2026..Is it because I called the other person in the dormitory room Big Invigilator?\u201d\u201cQin Jiu\u201d walked ahead and then turned around. He tilted his head as he walked backwards and studied \u201cInvigilator A\u201d\u2019s expression.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cInvigilator A\u201d who was watched for a while finally couldn\u2019t hold himself back. He spoke up: \u201cWalk properly.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll walk properly as soon as I get the answer.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cThen walk upside down.\u201d\u201cQin Jiu\u201d suddenly laughed.He then said: \u201cBig Invigilator, out of us and those two, who do you think is real and who do you think is fake?\u201d\u201cInvigilator A\u201d said expressionlessly: \u201cUs.\u201dPlease read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen.But after a while, he suddenly said: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m dreaming.\u201d\u201cMn?\u201dHe felt like he was in a dream.As for what reality was like, it was unclear. But dreams have always been vague and illogical.\u201cI vaguely remember you becoming an invigilator, but you\u2019re saying that you\u2019re an examinee.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cInvigilator A\u201d didn\u2019t say anything else.Afterall, his memories were also vague so he couldn\u2019t say it with certainty.It was as if in this place, only his personality and appearance hadn\u2019t changed but the rest had been cut off. There was no past, and no future\u2026\u2026.Perhaps those two were right?They came from a dream?After thinking for a while, he suddenly asked \u201cQin Jiu\u201d out of nowhere: \u201cAt the dormitory, why did you think the other person was real?\u201d\u201cQin Jiu\u201d raised the corner of his lips: \u201cAre you jealous Big Invigilator?\u201dHan Ling up ahead almost tripped.\u201cInvigilator A\u201d: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cQin Jiu\u201d then said: \u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll be serious.\u201dHe squinted his eyes in thought for a moment.Why was it?Perhaps it was because the lights weren\u2019t on?When he first saw \u201cInvigilator A\u201d, for some reason he felt that he was a little far. Despite clearly standing near the balcony and was at most five or six metres away, he felt that it was so far, he couldn\u2019t see him clearly.It was as if there were various annoying things between them, preventing him from seeing the other party more clearly.He felt that if the moonlight was just a little brighter\u2026\u2026\u2026perhaps he could see more clearly.He thought about it and said to \u201cInvigilator A\u201d: \u201cThe room was too dark. Maybe it was because he wore an earring, so I saw him more clearly.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026***Downstairs, a large group of the white-haired monkeys had perished.The little fatty Zhang Ming could no longer speak. These two great masters were astonishingly efficient. They flew through the monkeys and ghosts like a tornado ripping through a town.He had even forgotten about his fear and inexplicably felt exhilarated!The most frustrating thing was that the flagpoles in the yard had been broken off and were lying on the ground.Teacher A had used them as bamboo sticks and skewered all the ghosts and beasts he defeated onto it. Like meat skewers, more than a hundred laid scattered everywhere.The little fatty and the other boys who were huddled together got hungry just looking at it.Qin Jiu turned his head and saw You Huo raise his foot. The last of the ghosts was kicked into the air before accurately plunging into a pole.Standing on a tall dilapidated wall, he lightly tapped the top of his shoe with the steel bar in his hand. He looked into the distance and then lowered his head and said to You Huo: \u201cAre you hungry? The lights in the cafeteria are still on. Want to get something?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe boys nearby: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dYou Huo stood there coldly for a moment and then turned to ask the little fatty: \u201cWhat time is it?\u201dLittle fatty: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cTe-ten minutes past two.\u201dIn just ten minutes, the entire dormitory area had been cleaned up\u2026\u2026.If it continued like this, then they really would have time to go have supper at the cafeteria.The little fatty shook his head to throw away those ridiculous thoughts.Qin Jiu jumped off and went together with You Huo to the cafeteria.The little fatty and the others looked at each other and wondered if they\u2019re really going to go have supper. They then followed behind them like ducklings.Before they could take more than a few steps, Qin Jiu suddenly said: \u201cYou haven\u2019t answered the question\u2026\u2026..Big Invigilator.\u201dWhen he said the first half, he was initially going to stop there.But he felt that it was incomplete, as if it was missing something.It wasn\u2019t until he added that title at the end that he felt that\u2026\u2026.this was right.It was as if\u2026\u2026\u2026the man from the dream had opened a hole for him, allowing a rush of fresh air to enter.You Huo subconsciously turned his head. He was probably afraid that he would tug at his ear again.He pursed his lips and said subconsciously: \u201cBecause it\u2019s bright.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cMn?\u201dAfter he said that, You Huo himself felt that the reason was too strange. He continued: \u201cI forgot. I was wearing it when I woke up. I don\u2019t remember why anymore.\u201dAfter being asked by Qin Jiu, he finally realised that he had never seemed to consider taking it off.He couldn\u2019t remember why he wore it, but he didn\u2019t want to take it off.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Don\u2019t mind me.

All the ghosts fled from the school and would along the way kill the even smaller things.With the little fatty\u2019s words: \u201cThose monsters and ghosts are so pitiful\u2026\u2026.They\u2019re walked around like dogs.\u201dThe big fish ate the smaller fish while smaller fish ate the shrimp and the shrimp ate dirt.This chain dealt with 90% of the monsters.Although the remaining 10% were troublesome, it could still be cleaned up before sunrise.At 4:37am in the morning, the two laboratories on the west side of the school were ablaze with fire.Countless zombies rushed over like a wave. They attacked the large monsters and chewed them down until only bones remained.Burnt smells that accompanied the roars travelled throughout the school.The teachers who were helping out collapsed at a safe distance away pathetically catching their breath.The two chemistry teachers who did the most were whispering to each other.One said: \u201cI knew it. Sooner or later, the school\u2019s laboratory was going to burn down. Look at it now, both of them are gone.\u201dThe other said: \u201cIt was obviously bombed\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same. Haven\u2019t you sung that song before when you were younger? Something about carrying a backpack to bomb the school. That dream came true tonight.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026You should watch yourself. It\u2019s okay to say things like this in class to make the students happy but you shouldn\u2019t speak nonsense in front of Director Xiao.\u201dDirector Xiao\u2019s heels had already disappeared who-knows-where and you could no longer make out the original colour of her dress. Even like this, when she sat on the ground her posture was still very proper. With two legs crossed to one side, she remained reserved.She tapped on her phone a few times. The Chinese teacher Yu Luo next to her couldn\u2019t help but turn her head and ask: \u201cDirector Xiao, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cRecording the damages.\u201dAs Director Xiao typed, she said: \u201cTwo student dormitories destroyed, two laboratories burnt, the sports field was half destroyed, four roads cracked, the bridge connecting the school broken, table and chairs in shambles\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Luo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dWith the other party often maintaining a stern look, she would normally be a little scared of the director but this time she couldn\u2019t help but say: \u201cDirector Xiao\u2026\u2026\u2026It may seem like there are lots of damages, but it\u2019s actually not bad. Tonight, no one was injured. At this time yesterday, we were still running around escaping from the monsters.\u201dShe felt that no matter what, these damages shouldn\u2019t be held responsible by those two\u2026\u2026ahem, four.Unexpectedly, once Director Xiao was done tapping on her phone, she looked over at her from behind her glasses: \u201cWhat is this Teacher Xiao Yu? You thought I was going to get A and B to compensate us? I\u2019m usually very strict and hard to talk to but that doesn\u2019t mean that I can\u2019t distinguish between black and white. I\u2019m recording this for the principal.\u201dYu Luo: \u201cHuh?\u201dDirector Xiao: \u201cShow the leader how miserable we are to get some money. Little girl\u2026..Go wash your face. We\u2019ll need to go thank those two later.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dTeacher Xiao Yu was stunned for a moment before running off with a smile.She washed off the dirt from her face and went together with Teacher Zheng to find You Huo and Qin Jiu.Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen.They found the great masters behind the bombed laboratories, but it wasn\u2019t good news\u2026\u2026\u2026because they had started fighting.Teacher Xiao Yu and Teacher Zheng looked at each other with confused expressions.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d Teacher Zheng couldn\u2019t endure it any longer. He rushed over to stop the fight but was held back by Teacher Xiao Yu.Teacher Zheng reluctantly shrank over in the corner and quietly watched the fight.With his rich experience in fights, he felt that the fight between those four wouldn\u2019t come to an end.The two sides both knew each other very well. All the moves were almost exactly the same, and their reaction times were also similar.He watched silently for about three minutes and was a little thankful that Teacher Xiao Yu had held him back.With his rashness, if he rushed in those four great masters wouldn\u2019t he harmed but conversely, he would probably be left with a bruised nose and swollen face.The two young teachers discussed with each other and decided to call for assistance.***In the distance, it was the sound of fire burning. Up close, it was the sound of wind whistling.Mixed in together with it was the sound of metal clashing and the rustling of fabric.Chokeholds would be choked back. Armlocks would be armlocked back.It was extremely fierce and there were no signs of victory on either end.Those thousands of monsters didn\u2019t give them trouble, fighting oneself was the most troublesome.After another attack was intercepted, the two parties were at a deadlock for a few seconds. They then withdrew at the same time.Qin Jiu and You Huo were standing before the ruins so they subsequently jumped nearly behind the broken walls.They used the broken wall as a shield and used this opportunity to catch their breath.Qin Jiu suddenly laughed. He pulled at his collar and said: \u201cThis fight can\u2019t be fought.\u201dOn such a cold day, You Huo\u2019s temple was damp with sweat. He pursed his lips and breathed a little harder than usual.After recovering slightly, he said: \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a problem if you dealt your blows a little harder.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dWhen Qin Jiu had \u201cInvigilator A\u201d trapped earlier, if he was a little more aggressive, the other party would be stunned for at least two seconds, but he held back at a critical moment.Qin Jiu turned his head and looked at him for a moment before slowly pointing out: \u201cMr. A, if you\u2019re going to bicker about this, I\u2019ll have to say that you\u2019re no better.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dWhere are you getting all these names\u2026\u2026..He internally thought this.But Qin Jiu was right. He really wasn\u2019t any better. It was the same for him and the other \u201cQin Jiu\u201d.And objectively speaking, the opposite was also true.They realised halfway that the fight had become \u201cthem fighting themselves\u201d. If it continued like this, they would probably fight until the next century.\u201cWhat to do now?\u201d Qin Jiu leaned back against the wall.\u201cDid they understand what we said before?\u201dYou Huo muttered.They weren\u2019t just fighting earlier and were actually exchanging words through their blows. They had told their other selves the general exam situation as well as the consequences of not completing the cleaning.Qin Jiu: \u201cMaybe.\u201dHe had a feeling that they weren\u2019t just people from a dream. He felt that\u2026\u2026\u2026that was himself, and that was You Huo.A You Huo from a certain time and himself from a certain time.And that was why they would always hold back at critical moments.Qin Jiu rested the back of his head against the wall and suddenly winked at You Huo: \u201cWhat exactly did you dream about?\u201dThat gentle wink surprised You Huo for a moment. He then returned to his senses and looked away: \u201cA room that seems to have a table and chair. There\u2019s also a\u2026..\u201dBed.It was a simple word but You Huo suddenly stalled.\u201cA what?\u201d Qin Jiu asked.You Huo narrowed his eyes: \u201cA bow.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c?\u201dYou Huo expressionlessly spoke some nonsense: \u201cYeah, I was holding a bow and arrow. Probably was going to hit you with it.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c???\u201dTwo more seconds passed.You Huo heard a low laugh from the person next to him.***A few tens of metres away, examinee \u201cQin Jiu\u201d and \u201cInvigilator A\u201d were hiding around the corner of the teaching building watching for movements from the other two.\u201cQin Jiu\u201d looked on for a while before suddenly speaking up: \u201cInvigilator, do you believe what the other two said just now?\u201dPlease read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen.\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\u201cI believe.\u201d\u201cQin Jiu\u201d said.\u201cInvigilator A\u201d was a little surprised: \u201cYet you fought that long?\u201d\u201cQin Jiu\u201d let out a sound of acknowledgement.In fact, \u201cInvigilator A\u201d also believed it. Afterall, the timeline of the other two was the same whereas his and the examinee \u201cQin Jiu\u201d\u2019s were not.Logically speaking, if one of them must be fake, it could only be himself and \u201cQin Jiu\u201d.He was also aware of this, yet he also fought for a long time.It was silent for a few seconds. No one spoke.After a while, \u201cQin Jiu\u201d lazily turned his head around. His dark eyes reflected light amidst the dark sky: \u201cActually, I also feel like I\u2019m dreaming. As far as I know, we seem to have been in opposition for a long time.\u201d\u201cInvigilator A\u201d looked at him.\u201cQin Jiu\u201d suddenly winked at him and said: \u201cNow that I\u2019ve got the rare opportunity to be your teammate, I should naturally make the most of it don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201cInvigilator A\u201d didn\u2019t speak.After a while, he turned his head and laughed.\u201cQin Jiu\u201d looked at the thin lines outlining his neck and suddenly had an urge to bite down onto it.He restored his gaze and licked the tip of his teeth.In the distance, the sky was getting lighter. The thick darkness had slowly turned grey.He knew that the sun was about to rise.Soon, time was about to be up. They were the last two dreams that needed to be cleaned.\u201cQin Jiu\u201d didn\u2019t look back: \u201cBig Invigilator\u2014\u2014-\u201d\u201cMhn.\u201d\u201cIt seems that I am always the one calling you. What do you call me? I suddenly want to know.\u201d\u201cInvigilator A\u201d stopped for a moment.This was probably a dream of his. A fragmented dream; one without a past or future. All the scenes only consisted of the meeting room, the corridor, his blurry faced colleagues and Qin Jiu.In this dream, he never called Qin Jiu\u2019s name, nor did he call him anything else.But the moment he heard the question, an answer suddenly appeared in his mind.It was as if it was buried in his subconsciousness and had been said in private many times.He said: \u201cGi.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cGin. Without the last letter.\u201d\u201cThey all call me that? Or is it just you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIs this a nickname?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cAlright then, I\u2019ll remember it.\u201d\u201cQin Jiu\u201d grinned and said: \u201cThe sky\u2019s getting brighter. Dare to gamble?\u201d\u201cInvigilator A\u201d: \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I dare?\u201d***Behind the broken wall, You Huo suddenly asked Qin Jiu: \u201cIf it was you, what would you do?\u201dIf you found out that you\u2019re from a dream and would cause trouble if you remained in reality, what would you do?Qin Jiu said: \u201cProbably will play around more crazily.\u201dWhen he heard this question, arrogance and madness had once again surged from his bones.He thought\u2026\u2026.No, he was very certain\u2014\u2014-\u201cLook to your left.\u201dYou Huo looked over. The red-orange fire was extremely dazzling in the night.Qin Jiu said: \u201cI will make a big gamble. Let\u2019s go in.\u201dAs he said that, they heard someone suddenly whistling.It carried a teasing and arrogant nuance.They looked at each other and stood up.Not far away, the Qin Jiu from the examinee period and Invigilator A walked side by side.The blazing fire behind them stretched their shadows before them. At this moment, the red-orange fire was especially fierce.Qin Jiu looked at himself from a certain point in time in the past turn around and wave with his back towards them. As usual, he carried a lazy and arrogant demeanour. Together with You Huo from a certain point in time, they walked into the fire without looking back.At that moment, Qin Jiu once again felt a sense of familiarity.He could even remember the feeling of being surrounded by fire\u2026\u2026..Not far away, a group of teachers and students rushed over screaming and gasping.The little\u2019s fatty\u2019s voice carried over. He said: \u201cFuck, if I have another dream tonight, I would probably dream about this\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just him. Everyone felt this way too.If they dreamt again, they would either dream of the great masters entering the fire or of the great masters fighting the monsters.\u2026\u2026The moment the little fatty finished speaking, the scene suddenly stopped.The system\u2019s voice sounded.\u3010Due to unpredicted factors, the examination centre has stalled. Cleaning is suspended. All examinees please leave the centre immediately.\u3011If there was another night of this, with more than a thousand students there would be more than a thousand You Huo and Qin Jiu.That would be even more terrible than the zombies and Godzilla.If the system was a human, one word could replace that announcement\u2014\u2014-Scram!!!!Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net<Chatper 73>ClickNovel has something to say: Getting kicked out \ud83d\ude02Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

While Qin Jiu wasn\u2019t paying attention, he frowned and touched his earlobe and the side of his neck.It was all thanks to Qin Jiu\u2019s hand.Now, as long as he speaks a little closer to him, You Huo\u2019s ears would begin to ring alarm bells.It was like someone getting ready to tickle you. Despite being five centimetres away, you would already start to sweat and feel ticklish.The only difference however, was that that is an instinctive reflex. You Huo\u2019s on the other hand was an acquired reflex\u2014\u2014\u2013Number of times required to acquire: 1Incubation time: 1 second.The results were immediate, the final outcome outstanding.Perhaps it might be because it is a rather sensitive place.The great master thought self-depreciatingly.The two walked within the smoke for a while. Except for the blurred vision, they didn\u2019t find it too suffocating.You Huo suddenly said: \u201cLet me ask you a question.\u201d\u201cMhn?\u201d Qin Jiu glanced at him without surprise: \u201cWhat is the question?\u201d\u201cHaving invigilated for so long, how many people have you seen pass successfully?\u201d\u201cPass successfully?\u201dQin Jiu was silent for a moment. He then smirked: \u201cThere are two situations. Which one are you referring two?\u201d\u201cTwo situations?\u201dQin Jiu pointed at himself: \u201cThe first kind is in front of you; those that successfully pass the examination and later become an invigilator. I have seen many of this. Practically everyone in the invigilators district are like this.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe originally wanted to say that he was obviously not asking this but for some reason he suddenly remembered Qin Jiu\u2019s words from when they were on Captain Barentz\u2019s ship.\u201cYou said that\u2026\u2026.\u201d You Huo asked: \u201cYou can\u2019t receive letters?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cMhn\u201d\u201cHave you gone outside before?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cOf course, there is a period I no longer remember but as far as I remember, I haven\u2019t. I can also answer your question earlier\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201d\u201cThe other type of people who successfully pass the exam would have average grades and standard performance. According to the regulations, they do not become invigilators and are able to leave this place.\u201d Qin Jiu paused and said: \u201cI have indeed seen them. There aren\u2019t many and they\u2019re getting fewer and fewer. As for whether they really returned home after leaving and whether they still remember what happened in here, I don\u2019t know\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAfterall, he had never gone out.At this moment, You Huo wanted to ask what the purpose of this exam was.But he thought about it again. There was no point using normal logic to try and understand something that had gone out of control.He remembered 021 once mentioning that this system was developed through joint efforts of various parties and was originally used for military screening.Technically speaking, things that were developed by the military shouldn\u2019t normally lose control\u2026..But since it was joint efforts, it made it hard to say. Perhaps someone had secretly planted a small seed during the research and development process.If that was the case\u2026\u2026\u2026.Do the people who leave this place still remember what happened in here?Have the people outside realised that the system had gone out of control?With so many people dragged into here to take part in the exam, no one noticed that it\u2019s strange?Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen. Please don\u2019t support those thieves, the translator KK is going to cry\u2026Perhaps the time in the system is different to the time in reality.If they stayed here for several months, perhaps only a day or two had passed in reality? Or maybe a few hours?It is hard to say\u2026\u2026.Compared to what the system which had gone out of control had in mind, he was more concerned as to whether anyone had left and whether they could leave.Was it possible\u2026\u2026\u2026..to set free everyone trapped in here?He looked around.From what he could see, apart from Qin Jiu and the smoke, there was nothing else.But Qin Jiu had said that in an examination centre, the system is everywhere.It wouldn\u2019t be a good idea discussing here how to get rid of the system or how to find some loopholes.And so, You Huo didn\u2019t ask any further questions.Qin Jiu also realised this.He specifically went and changed the topic: \u201cWhy are you suddenly asking this?\u201d\u201cWould you answer if I asked you on the first day?\u201d You Huo glanced at him.\u201cFirst day?\u201d Qin Jiu casually walked ahead and recalled for a moment: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.That time I brought you back to the invigilator\u2019s quarter with a note?\u201dIt clearly wasn\u2019t that long ago, but it felt like it happened in their last lifetime.But when recalled, it was still clear and vivid.You Huo corrected: \u201cAbused your authority and brought me back.\u201d\u201cAbused my authority?\u201d Qin Jiu looked at him doubtfully. You couldn\u2019t tell whether he had really forgotten or was just pretending to have forgotten.Under You Huo\u2019s stare, he let out an \u201coh\u201d and said: \u201cYou mean how I wrote you down as a young girl?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeeing that his footsteps has stopped, Qin Jiu carelessly raised a hand and said: \u201cDon\u2019t glare at me so quickly. I have the right to plead my case.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cI am very wronged Mr. Invigilator.\u201dWronged your ass.This was written on You Huo\u2019s cold face. He was unmoved.Qin Jiu said: \u201cYou should know\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201dYou Huo: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cOkay then, you don\u2019t know\u2014\u2014-\u201d Qin Jiu changed his words: \u201cDid you notice that 154 and 922\u2019s notes were handwritten?\u201d\u201cWhat about it?\u201d\u201cIf you paid more attention afterwards, you would\u2019ve noticed that the system wouldn\u2019t handwrite anything and would just send the information over directly.\u201d Qin Jiu explained slowly: \u201cThe initial report I received from the system said that it was you. Later, it changed into a young girl and then it changed back to you. Like this, it changed back and forth three times.\u201dYou Huo coldly cursed the system \u201cretard\u201d.Qin Jiu: \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cIt is rare to see the system being so indecisive. Like it was stalled, it jumped from one end to the other. That expressionless 154\u2014\u2014-\u201dYou Huo glanced at him.Qin Jiu placed an index finger on his lips: \u201c\u2014\u2014Don\u2019t tell him I said that. 154 urged us to hurry and leave so I just scribbled down young girl and tossed it to him. In any case, I was going over there too, so I\u2019ll be able to tell who violated the rules once I\u2019m there.\u201d\u201cAfter that, I probably don\u2019t need to explain myself.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cThe young girl didn\u2019t exist, so I naturally thought that it was you.\u201dWith him saying this, You Huo finally understood.The one who had violated the rules at that time was Shu Xue but Shu Xue was a special case \u2014\u2014- She was a system bug. In most cases, she wasn\u2019t even considered an examinee or a living person. And with the black widow attaching her daughter to her, the young girl the system referred to was probably the daughter.Qin Jiu, 154 and 922 would naturally be unable to find this young girl.And so, the only person who could\u2019ve violated the rules was him.\u201cIs an explanation like this acceptable?\u201d Qin Jiu stopped.A gleam of light flickered across the sky. Soon following that was the roar of thunder.The smoke in the air was cut through by the lightning before gradually becoming fainter and disappearing.In a blink of an eye, the scenery around them had changed.The ruined school was gone and the ground below their feet had turned into a wet surface. They were surrounded by cliffs and a familiar high-rise building stood before them. Against the night, its large windows reflected faint cold light.It was one of the twin towers, the one they had jumped down from.Looking up at it from below, the tower looked extremely tall.There were no doors before them let alone elevators. There was only a steel ladder nailed into the wall leading up the building.A ladder that was\u2026\u2026..several dozens of floors high.Apart from that, there were no other paths.A familiar voice once again urged them:\u3010All examinees please leave this place immediately and return to the punishment centre.\u3011Immediately\u2026\u2026\u2026Why don\u2019t you try it yourself???Qin Jiu looked up and estimated the distance \u201cLooks like the system is pissed.\u201dYou Huo snorted.Qin Jiu looked on for a while before suddenly calling out to him: \u201cBig Invigilator.\u201dYou Huo turned to look at him.\u201cHave I told you that when I first saw you that day, I was in a bad mood?\u201d Qin Jiu also looked at him.You Huo\u2019s brow wrinkled slightly.\u201cDon\u2019t frown, I haven\u2019t finished speaking yet.\u201d Qin Jiu then said: \u201cThat was actually what 154 and 922 said. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s accurate.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think then?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Qin Jiu paused. He then said: \u201cI can\u2019t remember now. I have said some rude things in front of you at that time too. As for whether I meant it or not, I couldn\u2019t tell. Since I didn\u2019t get the feeling of meeting an old friend when I first saw you, I think most of it was true. I guess\u2026\u2026.our relationship in the past wasn\u2019t very good.\u201dAt that moment, You Huo\u2019s heart missed a beat.He couldn\u2019t describe what he was feeling.He also noticed Qin Jiu pursing his lips and narrowing his eyes.A moment later, Qin Jiu pointed at the tower with his chin: \u201cBut no matter how bad it was, I have already forgotten. Let\u2019s come to an agreement Big Invigilator. No matter what we remember later, let\u2019s not hold a grudge?\u201dYou Huo leaned to the side and listened to this proposal. He didn\u2019t speak.After thinking for a moment, he kicked Qin Jiu and said: \u201cHurry and go up.\u201d***This damned ladder wasn\u2019t something that deterred You Huo.He wasn\u2019t afraid of heights and his physical ability was good enough. At most, he would just be a little sweaty when he reached the top.Qin Jiu was just a little ahead of him. The two have similar speed and endurance so the distance between them remained unchanged.After who knows how long, You Huo heard rustling above him.Qin Jiu had already hopped onto the platform. His voice travelled over: \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201dYou Huo made a sound of acknowledgement and climbed up another two rungs.Now that he was closer to the platform, he got ready to jump onto the platform, but Qin Jiu instead squatted down on the edge.Not far away, the silver edge of the crescent moon that was partially obscured by the night clouds sprinkled faint light past his shoulders.With his back against the light, Qin Jiu\u2019s handsome features were even more defined.Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen. Please don\u2019t support those thieves, the translator KK is going to cry\u2026He raised his little finger at You Huo and there was a hint of a smile in his low voice: \u201cHave you considered my proposal? Would you like to lock it in?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t in a hurry getting up anyway.He could just stay on the ladder and catch his breath.His gaze fell onto Qin Jiu\u2019s thin and well-defined little finger before raising his eyes and looking at Qin Jiu: \u201cWhat does it mean after locking it in?\u201d\u201cAfter locking it in we will from now on be friends.\u201dThis was actually a sentence Qin Jiu had thought of in advance but when he said the word \u201cfriend\u201d, he felt that it wasn\u2019t right, as if it was still lacking something.But he only paused lightly before finishing off the sentence.You Huo\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change.He was always like that. Whether he was happy or unhappy, he would always appear cold and indifferent.He didn\u2019t make a sound. After a long time, he finally reached out and slapped Qin Jiu\u2019s palm.As his finger swept past Qin Jiu\u2019s palm, his little finger lightly hooked around Qin Jiu\u2019s finger.***The old man had never expected that there would people who would become sworn brothers while standing on the platform outside a high-rise building.Next to the elevator, the invigilators who had received the systems explosive notifications had already arrived.021, 078, 154 and 922. Not a single one of them was missing.They looked like they were about to face a powerful enemy. Seeing the two clapping hands out on the platform, the four invigilators were instantly dumbfounded.The orange in 922\u2019s hand fell to the ground.021 opened her mouth in shock for a moment and then turned around to curse.After the window was removed, You Huo and Qin Jiu walked in one after the other.The old man pointed at the metal panel and said: \u201cTouch it! You should touch it! It\u2019s so hot it can fry an egg. The whole database is in shambles.\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t expect the control pad up here to also be affected.He walked over and touched it. It was indeed very hot.The screen was stuck on the loading interface for who knows how long.Qin Jiu flicked it with his finger a few times but received no response. He asked the old man: \u201cWere you looking at this?\u201d\u201cBored so I was going through old records to reminisces.\u201d The old man thought some more and added: \u201cBut\u2026\u2026.I no longer remember who\u2019s who. It has been stuck on this page for more than twenty minutes. I haven\u2019t been able to change to the next page and it\u2019s all thanks to you two!\u201dQin Jiu leaned against the metal panel and beckoned over 154 and the others: \u201cWhat information did you receive? Has this cleaning task been suspended or is it over?\u201d154 is an honest man: \u201cIt\u2019s over. The exam is stalled, and the system isn\u2019t masochistic enough to send you to another one\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Jiu nodded in understanding: \u201cMakes sense.\u201d\u201cNow that the cleaning task is over, you two also have a chance to draw a card left. Once you\u2019ve drawn the card, you can go and wait at the examinee waiting sector.\u201d 154 said: \u201cWe have the cards here. 922\u2014\u2014\u2014-922?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d922 returned to his senses.He pulled out a stack of cards from his pocket and shoved it into 154\u2019s hands: \u201cYou shuffle. My hands are weak.\u201d154 looked at him like he was looking at someone crazy.\u201cAlright\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d154 shuffled the cards twice. Seeing that the other three didn\u2019t have any intention to move, he sighed and walked over to his boss and You Huo: \u201cHere, once for each of you.\u201dIn light of previous experience, You Huo who saw those cards had the urge to gnash his teeth.He pushed Qin Jiu over and said: \u201cYou first.\u201dQin Jiu who heard this laughed.He knew about You Huo\u2019s luck and didn\u2019t refuse. He randomly drew one from 154\u2019s deck.When he turned it over, he pouted.> Last-Minute CrammingAs a not very diligent examinee, all these years of exams has helped you develop a wonderful ability that is scientifically known as \u201cComprehensive accumulation of knowledge just before an exam\u201d and commonly known as \u201clast-minute cramming\u201d. Not everyone can do this, only those with skills can. Those who can often have excellent short-term memory, strong mental aptitude and suffer from a severe case of procrastination. Habit is something difficult to correct. Examinees who receive the last-minute cramming card can quickly learn an ability in an examination centre when they use this card.Remember, you can only learn one thing.No wonder Qin Jiu pouted.This wasn\u2019t exactly a good card.It could only be used in an examination centre, you could only learn one thing, and it wasn\u2019t guaranteed that this ability could help you clear the hurdle.For great masters like You Huo and Qin Jiu, this was really\u2026\u2026..a useless card.Qin Jiu\u2019s horrible luck gave You Huo some comfort.He walked over to 154 and pulled out a card.He shouldn\u2019t be unlucky to the point that he would always draw a good student card, right?As soon as he finished thinking this, he flipped the card around.Fuck.Another damned top student card.Even the old man couldn\u2019t hold back. He pfft\u2019ed and said: \u201cNice card.\u201dYou Huo\u2019s face once again turned green.The old man realised that he may have said something wrong and quickly backed away.For some reason when he first saw this examinee, he inexplicably wanted to get close to him. Taunting him probably wasn\u2019t the best way to get close to someone.***After the card drawing session was over, 154 indicated to You Huo and Qin Jiu that they could go.You Huo bid goodbye to the old man and walked towards the elevator.The other invigilators had already entered the elevator one after another.Qin Jiu however stopped for a moment by the metal panel\u2026..Because the screen that was said to have been \u201cstalled for more than 20 minutes\u201d had finally come to life. After the screen loaded for two seconds, it revealed a new page.Qin Jiu casually glanced at the screen as he moved to leave.But before he could take more than a step, his eyes slowly moved back.The old man was looking at records from many years ago.The records were arranged according to time. Generally, ten records would fill one page.But the new page that had appeared was different. There was only one solitary record listed in the centre. It read:Rule Violator: Invigilator AViolation: Overly intimate relationship with *.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: OMG the violationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if he didn\u2019t actively search for them, he has read his fair share of violation records.Not to mention others, he himself also has a few of his own.But this type of violation by Invigilator A was something he had not seen before.What on earth is going on with the asterisk???Many people enter and leave the system. Including both the invigilators and examinees, they could make up a small city.Unable to see every one of those faces and unable to recognise every one of them, was there a need for the asterisk?If you took a thousand steps back and thought about it\u2026\u2026\u2026Since the rules had already been violated, wouldn\u2019t it be normal to expose it?What was the point of covering it up? Giving them a leeway?Qin Jiu furrowed his brows and poked at the name \u201cInvigilator A\u201d.The screen changed to another page. It revealed all the records under the name \u201cInvigilator A\u201d.The number of violations by Qin Jiu was shocking. Afterall, just the number of times he cleaned the examination centre was twelve times. If you added the various violations he accumulated at other times\u2026\u2026.It would be difficult to keep track of.In comparison, Invigilator A\u2019s page was much cleaner.At the end of each violation record there would be a small symbol. Each would have a different colour.It represented the systems perception of how severe the violation was\u2014\u2014\u2014Small troubles that were harmless are green;Ones that were a little worse are yellow;The more severe cases are orange;And the highest level is red.On Qin Jiu\u2019s screen with numerous violations, most were green with one or two yellows and oranges scattered in between. Red was naturally rare.Our Invigilator Mr. You didn\u2019t have many violation records. In total, there were five.Three oranges and two reds.That was it.Qin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe suddenly remembered a description he heard from a colleague of his.It was said that back then Invigilator A was young and arrogant, cold and distant. He was basically a perfect representative of the system.But now\u2026\u2026\u2026.Perfect representative my ass. The system would be the first to disagree.This invigilator either didn\u2019t violate the rules or if he violated the rules, he would take it too far.When sorted by time, that \u201cOverly intimate relationship with *\u201d was Invigilator A\u2019s first violation.The strange thing about it was that this violation was orange.How intimate must an intimate relationship be for it to be orange?Qin Jiu stared that that line for several seconds.He thought the other violation records could provide some clues about the \u201casterisk\u201d but unexpectedly all personnel mentioned in his records were censored out.The red violations were even worse; they were all blank.This clearly meant that after Invigilator A was removed, the system not only deleted all his photos and information, it also cut off all the relationships he had with the others\u2026\u2026Even the violation records were not overlooked.Qin Jiu guessed that even if You Huo pressed his hand onto the panel now, it probably wouldn\u2019t reveal anything about his identity.As for why the system still retained these records instead of deleting them\u2026\u2026\u2026..Perhaps it was left there as a warning to the future invigilators?And now to the bigger question \u2014\u2014\u2013Who was this asterisk?***\u201cBoss!\u201d 154 held the elevator door open and shouted out: \u201cDo you still need something?\u201dYou Huo who was standing deep inside the elevator saw Qin Jiu\u2019s finger tap on the metal panel a few times before looking over.Perhaps it was just a coincidence. As he looked over, his eyes passed through 154, 922 and the others and directly met with You Huo\u2019s eyes.A few minutes ago, he was clearly acting like a rogue on the roof platform but now he seems\u2026\u2026\u2026unhappy?You Huo\u2019s gaze had a hint of questioning.Qin Jiu looked away and closed the screen, \u201cComing.\u201dHe would usually be smiling but when he walked over, his mouth was pursed into a straight line. This kind of expression was rarely seen on him. Whenever it inadvertently slipped out, it would make the other party feel an invisible sense of pressure.When the elevator door closed, 078 found himself faced with this pressure.Standing in front of him was Qin Jiu, to his left was 021 who looked like she had just eaten something wrong, to his left was 922 who had once again lost his soul and behind him was You Huo whose eyes he would meet if he turned his head slightly.078 felt suffocated.Five minutes later, this suffocation reached its peak.The reason for this was Qin Jiu\u2019s words earlier about inviting You Huo to his place.The villas were next to the twin towers and are fenced off with only an entrance and exit.078 didn\u2019t have a problem entering but when You Huo took a step in, the entire access area flashed, and a warning sounded.\u3010Warning. Entry is prohibited.\u3011Qin Jiu and You Huo looked at 078 at the same time.078: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d078 didn\u2019t know what sin he had committed for him to suffer like this.Fortunately, the system spoke up in time:\u3010Dangerous examinees are prohibited from entering an invigilator\u2019s residential area.\u3011\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Qin Jiu asked with dissatisfaction.The system here sounded much livelier. It even interacted with Qin Jiu.Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen. Please don\u2019t support those thieves, the translator KK is going to cry\u2026It said:\u3010This is the order to prohibit entry of dangerous examinees.\u3011Qin Jiu: \u201cWhat rule states it? Why don\u2019t I know about it?\u201d\u3010Article 13, line 5 of Safety Regulations of the Invigilators District. As of today, ot has been in effect for 4 years, 11 months and 7 days.\u3011\u201cAlright then. Even if there is a rule like that,\u201d Qin Jiu continued, \u201cwhat is the definition of a dangerous examinee? How is he one?\u201d\u3010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u3011The system didn\u2019t answer for about five seconds. There were only buzzing sounds as electricity flashed to express its silent complaints.154 couldn\u2019t watch any longer and whispered: \u201cBoss, how is he not one\u2026\u2026..\u201dAt the same time, the screen at the entrance angrily revealed several lines\u2014\u2014-Examinees with the following characteristics are classified as a dangerous examinee:Those points above all applied to You Huo.154 coughed.Even 021 turned her head slightly.\u3010Involved invigilators please take the dangerous examinee away from the residential area and settle them in at the examinees waiting sector as specified by the rules. Before the punishment time is over, the examinee must not leave their designated room.\u3011If that was a threat, You Huo didn\u2019t take it seriously.But the system added something else:\u3010If there is a violation, the examinee will be punished. Involved invigilators will also be punished for their mistake.\u3011\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt was equivalent to having their fates hanging from the same line. You Huo revealed a hint of disgust on his face. His expression didn\u2019t look too good.\u3010Invigilators, please promptly take action.\u3011078 glanced at 021: \u201cThen\u2026..let\u2019s go?\u201d021 nodded. She pretended to be impatient and annoyed, and said to You Huo: \u201cHeard that handsome? Are you coming or not?\u201dYou Huo let out an \u201cmhn\u201d.He was used to being alone. He subconsciously started to leave.021 followed quickly with a clack of her high heels.But soon, the great master stopped his steps.021: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dYou Huo placed one hand in his pocket and used the other to fiddle with his earlobe.With half his face against the light, from 021\u2019s angle she couldn\u2019t see his expression clearly nor make out what he was thinking.She saw him stand there for a moment and then turn to look back.Not far away, Qin Jiu was still at the entrance. His shadow was stretched out by the streetlight next to him and he was saying something to 154 and 922.Halfway through the conversation, he seemed to have noticed something and suddenly looked this way.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Qin Jiu asked.You Huo thought for a moment and said: \u201cSince we\u2019re considered friends, do I need to bid you farewell before I leave?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dFor a moment his expression was a little complicated.As for why he felt complicated, he didn\u2019t know.Perhaps he had also eaten something wrong.You Huo watched him for a while and said: \u201cI\u2019m done bidding. Leaving now.\u201dHe then placed the hand that was fiddling with his earlobe into his pocket and walked off.021: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWTF\u201d hung above her head. She quickly shook it off and followed after him.***For a moment, the entrance to the residential area was quiet.154 secretly glanced at Qin Jiu\u2019s expression and couldn\u2019t help but say: \u201cBoss\u2026\u2026.are you hurt?\u201dQin Jiu returned to his senses and frowned: \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing. I just thought you didn\u2019t look comfortable and thought you might have gotten hurt while cleaning the examination centre.\u201d 154 said.\u201cNo.\u201dQin Jiu rubbed his neck and said firmly.\u201cThat\u2019s good then.\u201d 154 said: \u201cShall we go in?\u201dHe had followed them around for a long time and was starting to feel sleepy.But when Qin Jiu lifted his foot and stepped in, the system once again rose from its grave:\u3010Warning! Dangerous examinees are prohibited from entering!\u3011154 who was just crossing through the door was almost electrocuted.He quickly stepped back and shouted out with his deadpanned face: \u201cWhat is this?!\u201dThe system repeated stubbornly:\u3010Dangerous examinees are prohibited from entering!\u3011The screen with the definition of a dangerous examinee flashed twice.154 stared at the screen for a few seconds before slowly turning to Qin Jiu: \u201cUm boss\u2026..It might have\u2026\u2026.also classified you as an examinee.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dSoon afterwards, the two dangerous ruffians You Huo and Qin Jiu once again met in the corridor of the waiting sector.One was forced into 318, and the other was forced into 324.***With the cleaning task completed ahead of schedule, for the next two days they were required to stay in the room.The room was actually not small. It was a little like a hotel suite room.But\u2026\u2026.it was very boring.You Huo walked around the room and charged his phone.He had grown used to using his phone as a timer, a recording device and a gaming device so he was surprised to see that he was connected to the internet when he swiped open the screen.You Huo froze for a moment and asked 078 who was accompanying him: \u201cThere\u2019s internet here?\u201d078 huddled in the corner of the sofa dejectedly: \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s not the internet you are familiar with.\u201dYou Huo randomly opened a few apps and saw that they could all be used: \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cHow should I put it\u2026..You can use the internet to search for things and find all kinds of information, that is not a problem.\u201d 078 thought for a moment and said: \u201cBut if you want to send something out, you can\u2019t. In other words, you can receive information and use this opportunity to see what it\u2019s like outside, but the outside can\u2019t receive anything from you.\u201d078 laid there and rubbed his nails. He mumbled: \u201cYou can get information, but nothing gets out.\u201dHearing him say that, You Huo opened the browser and searched a few key words.The webpage loaded very quickly. There were no limitations put in place.He then opened a few social media applications.These applications were still stuck on National Day which was the day he was pulled into the examination system.Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen. Please don\u2019t support those thieves, the translator KK is going to cry\u2026He rarely chatted with people so there were only four people on his messaging interface.The one at the top was Yu Wen. This cousin of his was the most talkative and would often send him something.Sometimes it would be a video, other times it was to a news report.You Huo would occasionally respond with a few words but if he read the message too late, he would just leave it on read.Fortunately, this cousin of his didn\u2019t need responding. His enjoyment was the act of sharing, so he didn\u2019t care much about it after pressing the share button.There was no burden in responding.Old Yu didn\u2019t speak much. Each year, he would send You Huo a few routine messages.During new years he would send messages commonly used by middle aged people and the rest were basically questions asking him: Are you coming back to China? When are you coming back? Are you coming to Harbin?As for the other two, they were his doctor and carer who took care of him while he recovered from his injuries.The hospital he stayed at had a close relationship with the military, and the doctor in charge of him was also of Chinese ethnicity. Surnamed Wu, the doctor would from time to time ask him about his health and how he was going with his recovery. His most recent messages asked him how he felt after returning to China.As for his head and eye injuries, it was this doctor Wu who first explained it to him.He said it was injury incurred during training and never mentioned anything about the \u201csystem\u201d.Seeing the exchanged messages on his phone, You Huo suddenly found it a little strange.This system was developed through joint efforts of various parties so even if there were some who had malicious intents and did something to it, wouldn\u2019t the involved personnel notice it after all these years?They couldn\u2019t be that slow.But if they knew, why did they hide it from him?To some extent, he was also a victim of the system going out of control. Doesn\u2019t he have the right to know about the cause of his injuries?For what reasons did they hide it from him?078 was still mumbling on but after a while his words started becoming more and more incoherent. He was seemingly about to fall asleep.Outside the window, the sky was dark.There was no one else in the examinee waiting sector, everything was extremely quiet.You Huo stared at the chat interface for a while and tried to send a message to Dr. Wu.Doctor, have you heard about the examination system\u2014\u2014-Just as he was about to finish the sentence, his fingers stopped.He thought about it and deleted the sentence, leaving only the word \u201cDoctor\u201d.After the message was sent, the small ring next to it kept spinning to indicate that it was trying to send.After about a minute, the small ring changed into an exclamation mark.You Huo pressed it and a box appeared: Do you wish to retry?He selected yes.The small circle again started to spin.After another minute, it once again changed into an exclamation mark.078 was right. Receiving information wasn\u2019t a problem but he couldn\u2019t send anything out.You Huo leaned back against the sofa and looked at the interface for a while before closing it.He switched back to the browser and searched for the name of the street where he, Yu Wen and Yu Wen\u2019s father was dragged into this system.After going through a dozen pages, he couldn\u2019t find anything.This meant that nothing strange had happened at that intersection the day the three of them were pulled into the system \u2014- There were no headlines, no news reports.And all his searches stopped at October 7<sup>th</sup>.Was there really a time difference?You Huo internally wondered\u2026\u2026\u2026.***For him, the sudden ability to access the internet was enough to help him address his boredom.But for Qin Jiu who had long grown accustomed to this kind of internet where he couldn\u2019t send anything out, he preferred to close his eyes and rest over searching for information on his phone.922 specially came over to change shifts with 154 to watch other their boss.He absentmindedly opened the fridge, pulled out some ingredients and absentmindedly entered the kitchen to fry some eggs and bacon.922 plated the food on two plates and brought it over to the coffee table. He placed one in front of Qin Jiu and used his fork to pierce a hole in his own bacon\u2026\u2026..\u201cBoss\u2026\u2026..\u201d922 glanced at him: \u201cLet\u2019s talk?\u201dEver since he discovered that You Huo was Invigilator A, it had been constantly bothering him. The more he held back, the more questions he had so he wanted to find a chance to have a chat with Qin Jiu.But before he was able to think of what to say, he heard Qin Jiu make a sound of agreement, straighten up and look at him with an incomprehensible look.Before he was even able to speak, 922\u2019s courage had disappeared under that stare.\u201cBoss? Why\u2026..why are you looking at me like that?\u201d 922 asked.Qin Jiu said: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Let me ask you a question.\u201d922: \u201cOh, what is it?\u201d\u201cOverly intimate relationship. What does it normally mean?\u201d Qin Jiu said.Although 922\u2019s ranking wasn\u2019t high, he was someone who had been an invigilator for three years, so he was very familiar with the language the system used.He opened his mouth and said: \u201cDoesn\u2019t it mean improper relationships? The system often words it like this, did you forget?\u201dQin Jiu\u2019s fingers loosely crossed together. His fingers tapped a few times: \u201cImproper relationships. What do you think it refers to?\u201d922: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe silently glanced at the plate and internally wondered: Boss didn\u2019t eat anything strange so why is he acting so strange today?He pondered for a moment and said: \u201cLo-lovers I guess.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d922 uncomfortably took a bite of his bacon.\u201cThen\u2026\u2026\u2026In what situation would an overly intimate relationship cause an orange level violation?\u201d922 swallowed the bacon with difficulty: \u201c\u2026\u2026..Found a particularly troublesome person and was engaged in an affair?\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he quickly drank some water.When he looked back up again, he was met with Qin Jiu\u2019s dark expression.922: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe wants to switch with 154\u2026\u2026\u2026..***After two long days were over, both the examinees and invigilators were finally set free.Two days later, the four retakers gathered at the re-examination area preparing to enter a new examination centre.021 pushed up her sunglasses and held a note in her hand: \u201cBecause this is a re-examination, the subject is still history. In a while, you will enter through this door. The examination centre has already been set up.\u201d\u201cWe wish you good luck.\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: HAHAHA Feeling bad for 922Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Someone glanced at him through the arguing crowd before picking up his jacket and leaving;On a certain day of a certain year, he led a group of people through a long corridor and happened to pass by another group of people. His footsteps paused momentarily but he didn\u2019t give his greetings;On a certain day of a certain year, he was driving around a corner of a street. Someone who was leaning against a streetlamp gradually got further and further away through the rear-view mirror;Again, on a certain day of a certain year, his vision was dark and blurred. Someone sat before him laughing and he heard rustling sounds that sounded like a scarf being tied. He seemed to smell blood, but he could already no longer see\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201cSir?\u201d\u201cSir? Are you okay?\u201dYou Huo blinked a few times and returned to his senses.At some unknown point in time, the fog had cleared up. Before him was a long dirt road and a black carriage. The coachman was dressed in clothes from another century and he spoke with a thick accent.He must have entered the exam.You Huo looked around. There was no one else around.The coachman said: \u201cYou don\u2019t look well. Your face looks pale.\u201dYou Huo stood there for a moment before responding: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dThe coachman glanced at him worriedly several more times.You Huo pinched the bridge of his nose and asked warily: \u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to pick up you and your wife.\u201d The coachman said: \u201cDid you forget? You promised to be a guest at Carlton Manor.\u201dYou Huo\u2019s movements stopped. He looked at him like he was mad: \u201cPick up who???\u201dThe coachman: \u201cYou and your wife.\u201dHe opened the carriage door and made a respectful gesture: \u201cMadam is already inside. Please come on. I have food prepared. You might feel better after eating a little.\u201dYou Huo\u2019s brows were so furrowed together, it could trap mosquitoes.He entered the carriage and saw a young lady inside who looked more confused than he was. She looked at most twenty.Inside the carriage was a round framed oil painting of a flat-faced cat.The coachman pushed him inside and said as he closed the door: \u201cThe weather in this area is bad, especially in this season.\u201dHe sat at the front and picked up the reins. Looking into the distance, he said: \u201cThat dark cloud there is coming closer. If we delay this anymore, I\u2019m afraid it will rain. Sir and madam, please be seated. We have to hurry and reach the manor before it rains.\u201dThe carriage was actually very spacious. The seats facing the door were decorated with gorgeous cushions and the sides were reinforced with armrests. The female stranger sat there and there was still enough space next to her to sit a large person.The girl froze for a moment before patting next to her and saying: \u201cThat\u2026\u2026You\u2019re also an examinee? You should sit here.\u201dBefore You Huo could say anything, she quickly added while waving her hand: \u201cPlease don\u2019t misunderstand. I don\u2019t have any intention to take advantage of you. I also just got on this carriage maybe about two minutes before you. That coachman caught me by surprise when he opened his mouth and started calling me madam. I tried to persuade him to change it, but it didn\u2019t work.\u201dYou Huo let out an \u201cmhn\u201d and said lightly: \u201cProbably the system\u2019s doing.\u201dHe however didn\u2019t sit down next to her and instead sat on the side to maintain a polite but also unfamiliar distance.This was not the young lady\u2019s first exam, so she had also seen many ridiculous things done by the system.But she still mumbled: \u201cWhat damned system would help people get married\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, there\u2019s wine and bread here. Would you like you eat a little? You don\u2019t look well\u2026\u2026.\u201dThere was a silver bucket filled with hard bread, two bunches of grapes and a couple of silver jugs.You Huo glanced at it: \u201cHave you eaten?\u201dThe girl shook her head: \u201cI\u2019m not hungry. I came after eating at the rest stop.\u201dYou Huo nodded.He was somewhat absentminded. He once again opened the window and looked out.\u201cAre you waiting for someone?\u201d The girl asked.You Huo\u2019s finger touching the window paused. He then answered: \u201cYeah.\u201d***Unfortunately, the coachman didn\u2019t appear to have any intention to wait around.There were also no other people here.The dark clouds in the distance slowly travelled closer but the sun above was still bright.It was already the middle of summer here. The sunlight poured over the treetops turning the green surface white.You Huo sat in the carriage for a while before noticing the heat.It was as if he was lost in thought before this.He removed his winter coat leaving only a white t-shirt.The girl said, \u201cThere is a box under my seat. You can put your coat in there.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cMy name is Zhou Qi. What about you?\u201d\u201cYou Huo\u201dZhou Qi let out an oh. Seeing that the other party wasn\u2019t very talkative, she didn\u2019t continue talking.She leaned her head to the side and looked out the window. Soon, she was lost in thought.The carriage travelled on for about half an hour. The coachman turned around and said: \u201cSoon we will enter the town and pick up another pair of guests.\u201dYou Huo opened his eyes. There were no signs of sleepiness in his eyes.Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen. Please don\u2019t support those thieves, the translator KK is going to cry\u2026For the first time he hadn\u2019t fallen asleep on the way to the examination centre.Hearing the coachman\u2019s words, he opened the window again.This was a small town with houses made of stone. The women wore tattered dresses from another century while the men wore grey shirts with deep necklines that almost reached their bellybuttons.It was clearly daytime, but the town wasn\u2019t busy.Everyone\u2019s expressions were dull, and their eyes were blank. Their faces sunk in making them look very sickly.When they saw the carriage approach, they quickly closed their windows and doors.The carriage made a turn in the town and stopped by a wood.In the forest was a familiar patch of thick fog. You Huo\u2019s eyes fell over to that place.The branches swayed with the wind and a woman stepped out from the fog.You Huo\u2019s eyes moved passed her and continued to look at the dense fog.The coachman once again walked over. He said: \u201cMadam, I\u2019m here to take you to Carlton Manor. If you could please board the carriage?\u201dAs he spoke, another person appeared from the thick fog.This time it was a man.It was unknown who he was. In any case, he wasn\u2019t Qin Jiu.At this moment, Zhou Qi was leaning against the door looking out. Behind her, there was suddenly a \u201cclatter\u201d.She was startled. When she looked back, she saw that the handsome man called You Huo had broken the window off. The metal hinge holding it dangled helplessly in the air. On the other hand, he had closed his eyes and was sitting there with his arms crossed. He clearly had no interest in their two new companions.Uh\u2026\u2026He seems to be in a bad mood.Of course, the moods of the two newcomers were no better.As soon as the man and women boarded, the entire mood in the carriage plummeted.Zhou Qi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t even know if I should introduce myself.But she was a passionate girl. After holding it in for a long time, she finally said politely: \u201cUm\u2026\u2026.My name is Zhou Qi. Are you also examinees?\u201dIt was obvious just by looking at their clothes.That woman appeared to be a little over thirty years old. She had short hair and looked very capable. She sat down next to Zhou Qi and said: \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just in a bad mood after being dragged over to take the exam. Did I scare you earlier? I\u2019m 0\u2014\u2014-\u201dShe spoke halfway and suddenly stopped. She then awkwardly changed her words: \u201cMy name is Zhao Jiatong.\u201dZhou Qi: \u201c?\u201dZhao Jiatong nudged the man next to her: \u201cGo on.\u201dThat man still carried the smell of alcohol on him. His hair was messy like a bird\u2019s nest and there was a faint stubble on his chin. Overall, he looked very dishevelled.He rubbed his face and looked up at Zhou Qi with bloodshot eyes. He said in a low voice: \u201c1006.\u201dZhou Qi: \u201c???\u201dShe was stunned for a moment before suddenly realising: \u201cInvigilator?\u201dZhao Jiatong nudged him again. He then changed his words: \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t sleep last night so I\u2019m a little muddled. What was my name again?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe two women looked at him stunned.At this point, Zhao Jiatong finally couldn\u2019t take it anymore. She rubbed her forehead and said: \u201cHis name is Gao Qi. Yeah\u2026\u2026..We\u2019re both invigilators.\u201dZhou Qi let out an \u201cah\u201d: \u201cInvigilators also have to take the exam?\u201dAs she said that, she glanced over at Gao Qi. He had pulled out a flask from the silver bucket in the carriage.Zhao Jiatong snatched the flask away with a stern expression: \u201cCan you be sober for just one day? Huh?\u201dZhao Qi shrank back.While she shrank back, she saw the handsome man who was in a bad mood through the corner of her eyes and was again scared.When he heard that the two opposite him were invigilators, he finally turned his head over and opened his eyes.Zhao Jiatong held the flask and apologised, \u201cSorry for wak\u2026\u2026.\u201dHalfway through her words, her eyes widened.She stared at You Huo\u2019s face in shock. The flash fell from her hands.Wine poured all across the carriage floor.Zhou Qi regained her spirit: \u201cHuh?\u201dShe looked at You Huo and then at Zhao Jiatong. The latter wasn\u2019t able to utter a single word the entire time and could only elbow Gao Qi like crazy.Gao Qi was secretly trying to grab another flash.\u201cIt\u2019s just one flask. One tiny flask!\u201d He protected the wine in his hands and looked up.Thud\u2026\u2026.Another one fell.Zhou Qi: \u201cHuh???\u201dWhat kind of magic is this???You Huo frowned. He lifted his leg to avoid the wine.Gao Qi finally uttered out a sentence: \u201cWhat the fuck, Invigilator A??!\u201dZhou Qi didn\u2019t know what this \u201cInvigilator A\u201d meant but she could tell that it was something big.Because this Mr. Gao Qi\u2019s voice had cracked.As an audience, she felt like even her voice would crack.Zhao Jiatong also murmured: \u201cInvigilator A\u2026\u2026.My god, is that you?\u201dGao Qi: \u201cYou\u2019re not dead???\u201dZhao Jiatong: \u201cWeren\u2019t you removed?\u201dGao Qi: \u201cYou\u2019re actually not dead???\u201dZhao Jiatong: \u201cHow could you still come back?\u201dGao Qi: \u201cHow are you not dead???\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026..Do you have a grudge against me?\u201dIn three sentences, he had died three times.Gao Qi who was asked this was in shock.He stared at You Huo while his mouth opened and closed several times. He finally uttered: \u201cGrudge? Hey\u2014\u2013 He asked if I have a grudge against him.\u201dGao Qi shook Zhao Jiatong a few times and said: \u201cMy god, he actually asked me if I have a grudge?\u201d\u201cAfter you fucking left, the one who suffered the most was me and you ask me something like this?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so angry.\u201d Gao Qi said this and grabbed another flash.Zhao Jiatong: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dThis time she didn\u2019t stop him.Gao Qi took a large swig and stared at You Huo for a long time with his bloodshot eyes.This strange man had surprisingly calmed down after drinking some alcohol.After a while, he said: \u201cDid you\u2026\u2026..forget about the past?\u201dYou Huo internally commented that he has keen observation. After having such a loud outburst, he finally started to speak properly.\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t remember.\u201d He said.Gao Qi\u2019s expression was complicated. He then nodded: \u201cThat\u2019s true, that\u2019s true\u2026..You were removed so they naturally wouldn\u2019t let you remember. But how did you get in again?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cHow should I know? I was having dinner with my family and the three of us got dragged in.\u201d\u201cThen you probably got involved by accident\u2026\u2026..\u201d Gao Qi said.Zhao Jiatong murmured doubtfully: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the system kick you out again?\u201dGao Qi: \u201cAre you also drunk? Once you\u2019ve entered, you must follow the rules. The system must follow the rules even if it wants to kick him out!\u201dZhao Jiatong: \u201cOh right.\u201dYou Huo responded: \u201cSeems like that\u2019s the case.\u201dPlease read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen. Please don\u2019t support those thieves, the translator KK is going to cry\u2026He had some doubts before about why 021 was being so careful whereas Qin Jiu would directly call him Big Invigilator.But now that he thought about it, just the fact that he had entered the system itself was a success.And 021 still needed to hide her identity and position. As for Qin Jiu\u2026..He has always been a thug.Gao Qi gulped down the rest of the wine and slammed the flask onto the table. He let out a long sigh: \u201cForget it, let\u2019s not talk about this. Since you no longer remember, let\u2019s get to know each other again.\u201d\u201cMe, I used to be rank D. Jiatong was rank E. We used to be in the same faction.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cFaction?\u201d\u201cOh right, that statement is outdated now. You probably have never heard of it.\u201dThat was something from a long time ago.At that time, invigilators had just increased from ten to fifty. Because a lot of outsiders were added at once and because the system was starting to go out of control, the conflicts in ideas and positions were even more obvious.The fifty invigilators were divided into two groups.The first faction mainly consisted of the initial invigilators. They were the first ones who were in contact with the system and had been with the system when it was functioning normally, so they more or less had developed some form of attachment. They insisted that the occasional moments when the system goes out of control was just a loophole that can be fixed gradually with continuous upgrades and improvements without the need to go against the rules and regulations. Afterall, they are currently bound by the systems rules.The other faction consisted of mostly newly joined invigilators. Every one of these people are a double-edged sword and most of them were hot-headed. They liked to challenge the rule boundaries and they all stood out.Their thoughts were more intense. Whenever there was a problem, they would directly break the rules to enforce changes.To put it bluntly, they treated the system as something potentially dangerous. One faction believed that it was better to slowly persuade it without angering it while the other faction believed that force was the only option.In fact, everyone knew at that time that most of the invigilators who had joined later came from the military and that most came with a mission.Because the core of the system was hidden here, if they wanted to do something, they could only enter the tiger\u2019s den first.But once inside, they are under the control of the rules.To go against the rules, they understood it more than anyone.To go against it for a day or two by force, that was fine.For one month? That was barely okay.Then one year?Who could last that long?What\u2019s more, every time they tried something and was unsuccessful, not only do the ones in the forceful faction suffer, the others were dragged in as well.Over time, even hard bones can be worn away.So, at the very beginning, the majority were in the forceful faction.Later, one after another after another, they shifted over to the gentle faction.The system bug resulting in the removal of Invigilator A was a warning to those in the forceful faction.After that, there were no more invigilators who would openly say that they are part of the forceful faction.In other words, there was no need for factions anymore.Everyone was the same.Gao Qi said: \u201cIt\u2019s meaningless to talk about it now. The people I would start fighting with as soon as I saw them back then, I can now talk to them normally. There are only a couple I still don\u2019t like seeing.\u201dAs soon as he said the first half, You Huo could guess the second half of his statement.But he still asked: \u201cFor example?\u201d\u201cFor example, 001.\u201d Gao Qi said. He then let out an \u201coh\u201d: \u201cYou might not have met 001. Back then, he was always going against you.\u201dYou Huo internally thought: As expected.\u201cDuring meetings back then, there would always be one party who would kick the door open and leave. I remember one time I accidentally placed the two of you too close together. The invisible knifes in the air\u2026\u2026\u2026..and then a glass and a phone was broken.\u201dGao Qi who said this then proceeded to smack his lips: \u201cI\u2019m actually missing it a little. I must be drunk.\u201dZhao Jiatong said: \u201cWhen are you not drunk?\u201dGao Qi then said: \u201cBut for me, shaking hands with 001 is not possible. If it weren\u2019t for him, you also wouldn\u2019t have almost died.\u201dHe mumbled and again emphasised: \u201cImpossible.\u201dAs they spoke, the carriage looped around Carlton Mountain and turned into the woods near the manor.The coachman said: \u201cSir, madam, we\u2019re almost there.\u201dAt this moment, the flat-faced cat hanging from the carriage wall spoke:\u3010Examinees have arrived at the final examination site using their respective carriages.\u3011\u3010The exam is about to officially start.\u3011\u3010Subject examined: History\u3011\u3010Knowledge tested: World history. Black Death\u3011\u3010This exam is a large-scale examination. There is a total of 26 examinees which have been divided into 13 groups. There are two examinees in each group. The total points between the two examinees will be the basis for calculating the grade in this exam.\u3011\u3010The scoring method in this exam follows the role-playing model. There are no answer cards or standard correct answers. In addition to the original score, there are opportunities for bonus points, and the possibility of point deductions.\u3011\u3010At the end of this exam, groups with a total score ranking of C will need to undergo re-examination. Those of rank D will be eliminated.\u3011\u3010The points will only be announced at midnight every night. Apart from that, only the examinees of each group will know about the changes to their points in real time.\u3011\u3010Now revealing the examination question.\u3011\u3010In 1347, the Black Death had spread to Carlton Mountain. Half of the people in the town had died because of this plague and Carlton Manor was no exception. The Duchess, her newly born son, the housekeeper and most the servants died last year. On Easter this year, the Duke mourned for the dead. Guests who came to expression their condolences assured the Duke that they had brought a doctor who could help treat the sick.\u3011\u3010Exam requirements: As a guest, examinees must not go against any requests made by the duke or both members of the group will be subjected to punishment.\u3011\u3010If you have any questions, you can ask invigilators 154, 922 and 021. Invigilator 078 has taken sick leave.\u3011The four people in the carriage looked at each other.After a moment, Zhou Qi asked carefully: \u201cThe guests who came, does that refer to us?\u201dZhao Jiatong: \u201cMost likely.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.Is there a doctor here?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen what is there to treat?!\u201dGao Qi said: \u201cThat\u2019s actually not the key point. From my experience, the exam requirements are often the key points. Rather than worrying about whether there is a doctor, it\u2019s better to worry about whether the Duke has any strange quirks and whether he will make strange requests.\u201dThe carriage stopped. The coachman got ready to open the door for them.When he opened his mouth, the first words he spoke was: \u201cUm\u2026\u2026.We will soon enter the manor. I just want to warn you that the Duke is actually very friendly, but he has some strange problems. You\u2026\u2026you should be careful.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe next moment, the carriage window was opened.The flat-faced cat oil painting was then thrown out.Gao Qi got off first.Many carriages were sitting outside Carlton Manor.The sky above was overcast. Dark clouds covered their heads and lightning split through. It made the castle-like building appear even more eerie.The rumbling of thunder roared\u2026\u2026..\u201cNot a good day\u2026\u2026..\u201dGao Qi muttered. He turned and looked at the other examinees.As he looked around, his eyes suddenly stopped. In an instant, his expression fell.Zhao Jiatong followed behind him and said: \u201cWhat are you doing? Saw a ghost?\u201dGao Qi: \u201cI fucking really did see a ghost!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dGao Qi pointed in the distance: \u201c001!\u201dZhao Jiatong followed his finger and saw Qin Jiu get off a carriage.Lightning flashed several times startling most of the examinees.Only he alone raised his head and looked around.\u201cWhat a bad coincidence\u2026\u2026\u2026he seems to be looking for someone?\u201d Zhao Jiatong commented, \u201cHuh? Is he looking here?\u201dGao Qi\u2019s back stiffened: \u201cFuck. He\u2019s not only looking here, he\u2019s coming over! What does he want?\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: You Huo, who were you looking for \ud83e\udd2d\ud83e\udd2dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although she had some differences with Qin Jiu, she wouldn\u2019t show it.Gao Qi was different.When Qin Jiu walked over, he acted like he had met his greatest enemy.If not for Zhao Jiatong holding him back, he would have already rolled his sleeves up.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Zhao Jiatong glared at him.Gao Qi: \u201cConditional reflex.\u201dZhao Jiatong said with frustration: \u201cI don\u2019t see you do that in the invigilator\u2019s district!\u201d\u201cAlcohol calms people down.\u201d Gao Qi lied to her face.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBesides, I rarely run into him. He\u2019s 001, I\u2019m 1006. Although we both have two zeros\u2026\u2026.\u201d Gao Qi said self-deprecatingly: \u201cThe difference is too big. Even if I want to fight, I can\u2019t.\u201dZhao Jiatong: \u201cRestrain yourself. They all say that 001\u2019s memory was affected, and he no longer remembers that incident.\u201d\u201cI know but who can guarantee that it\u2019s true?\u201d Gao Qi questioned.\u201cYou really are\u2026\u2026\u2026. What\u2019s the point of lying?\u201d\u201cThere are lots of benefits.\u201d Gao Qi started counting, \u201cSaves the need to explain what happened that day, won\u2019t having people look for him for trouble, avoids suspicion\u2026.. I fell from E to a four-digit number while he, the involved person, is still able to do whatever he likes after recovering. Aren\u2019t those benefits enough?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dZhao Jiatong had nothing to say.In fact, most of the early invigilators also thought this.The system bug accidentally injuring him \u2013 That was just an excuse.The earlier invigilators including those who were involved and those who were in the dark knew what went on\u2026\u2026..It was likely a case of someone secretly working on it, quietly making preparations with the intent to destroy the system in one go but for various reasons\u2014\u2014\u2013Was it someone leaking the information out? Infighting? Or someone deliberately going against that person? \u2014\u2014 In any case, the operation failed, and the system won in the end.Of the invigilators who were involved, the ones who needed to be punished were punished and the ones who needed to be monitored were monitored.Before the incident, the others didn\u2019t know about the specific details.But after that accident, they could tell just by looking at the result.Invigilator A was removed by the system whereas the one who was not affected and could continue on as Invigilator 001 was Qin Jiu.You see? It\u2019s obvious.They were surprised to see that the Invigilator A who had appeared to be a perfect representative of the system would actually do something someone in the forceful faction would do. They were also surprised to see the outwardly forceful faction advocate Qin Jiu in the end turn around and protect the system.After that incident, the system did some self-maintenance and self-upgrading.For almost a month, all the invigilators stayed in the invigilator\u2019s district while all the examinees stayed at the rest stops.Gao Qi was at first very angry. He had always regarded Invigilator A as a friend, but the other party had secretly done something like this without his knowledge. During that month he finally learnt that this was his cold-faced friends\u2019 way of protecting them, so that the system wouldn\u2019t do anything to them.If he was successful, everyone was free.If he was unsuccessful, only he would be affected.After that month, the system had changed significantly.On one hand, the monitoring of invigilators became more rigorous. A lot of rules were also added. On the other hand, it had become stranger.As for how it was strange, he couldn\u2019t pinpoint it.In any case\u2026\u2026.It was a little crazy.After that, the early invigilators gradually moved away from the systems core. They later became the subordinates of invigilators who had joined later, and their numbers were now near the end.As for the invigilators who had joined later, they didn\u2019t know if the system had used some tricks to convince them, or if it had brainwashed them.But those who entered the system would unknowingly start to forget about their life in the real world.It wasn\u2019t anything noticeable. Instead it was\u2026\u2026.You would suddenly realise that they never mentioned \u201cI did this before\u201d, \u201cThis happened to me when I was a child\u201d etc unless you asked. It was as if their life started when they entered the system.Since then, there were no more stubborn ones who would go against the system.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Regardless of the other matters, just based on this alone how could Gao Qi reconcile with Qin Jiu?His nostrils flared and he pointed at Qin Jiu: \u201cYou saw it. He approached me first.\u201dZhao Jiatong: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dZhao Jiatong wondered whether drinking too much affected his intelligence. His words were very immature.But she didn\u2019t have enough energy to argue back. It was because Qin Jiu had already approached them.She was also a little tense.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Gao Qi threw this sentence out.Qin Jiu\u2019s footsteps stopped. His eyes moved and, as if he had only just noticed him, his expression revealed slight surprise.He raised his hand and said: \u201cGood afternoon. Why are you here?\u201dGao Qi: \u201cGo ahead, keep pretending! If you didn\u2019t see us here, why did you come over?\u201dQin Jiu raised his eyebrow.In Gao Qi\u2019s eyes, he took it as taunting.Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen. Please don\u2019t support those thieves, the translator KK is going to cry\u2026Qin Jiu then suddenly started laughing: \u201cI don\u2019t get this strange hostility of yours\u2026\u2026\u201dGao Qi turned towards Zhao Jiatong and mouthed: See, the benefits of memory loss.Zhao Jiatong: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dQin Jiu stood in front of the carriage: \u201cBut I\u2019m not here for a fight. I\u2019m here for a person.\u201d\u201cListen to him. I told you he\u2019s here for\u2014\u2014-\u201d Gao Qi complained to Zhao Jiatong and suddenly stopped: \u201cFor what???\u201dQin Jiu placed both his hands behind his back and casually rotated his shoulders: \u201cI\u2019m here to find someone. No need to glare, it has nothing to do with you.\u201d\u201cYou came to our carriage to find someone, yet it has nothing to do with me? What the hell are you saying\u2026\u2026..\u201d After Gao Qi finished his sarcastic talk, he turned vigilant: \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201dAfter he asked, he heard a voice speak up behind him. It sounded from above his head.\u201cFor me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh???\u201dGao Qi looked back so fast, his neck looked like it was going to snap.He saw You Huo lower his head to get out the carriage. In his hand he carried his coat. He glanced at him and repeated: \u201cMe.\u201dGao Qi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe pointed at Qin Jiu and asked You Huo: \u201cDo you know who he is?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cQin Jiu.\u201dGao Qi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThis great master was afraid that Gao Qi may not know Qin Jiu\u2019s name, so he even considerately added: \u201cInvigilator 001.\u201dGao Qi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThis middle-aged man couldn\u2019t believe his ears.He turned his head again and pointed at You Huo as he asked Qin Jiu: \u201cDo you know who he is???\u201dQin Jiu looked up at You Huo.His posture with his hands behind his back was clearly a gentlemanly posture, but there was also a hint of arrogance.He laughed and said: \u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot of hurdles to get through to get to our Big Invigilator. Are these newly hired gatekeepers?\u201dThe faces of the gatekeepers turned green.\u201cWho\u2019s yours?\u201d\u201cHow is he your Big Invigilator?\u201d\u201cWhat our?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no our, take that back.\u201dGao Qi was like a rooster chasing after someone. He threw out those statements in succession.It even made Qin Jiu lean back a little.He was confused for a moment, but he soon recalled something from the depths of his memory.It seems that someone had told him a long time ago that this Invigilator 1006 not only knew Invigilator A, he was also Invigilator A\u2019s friend.When he heard about this at that time, to him Invigilator A was just a meaningless name \u2013 a predecessor who had already been deleted, someone who was younger than him by two years, someone who was very powerful and someone that he didn\u2019t get along with.That was it.So to him, those statements about his friends and family were just insignificant nonsense. He didn\u2019t pay it much attention.Unexpectedly, it actually became useful a couple of years later.He miraculously understood this unfamiliar invigilator before him and swallowed back the words \u201cYou drank too much\u201d.He didn\u2019t mind the other party\u2019s unfriendly attitude.You Huo supported himself and hopped off the carriage. He said to Gao Qi: \u201cI didn\u2019t mention it earlier. I know 001.\u201dHearing the word \u201cdidn\u2019t mention\u201d, Qin Jiu once again raised his eyebrow.You Huo continued to say to Gao Qi: \u201cThe first exam I did, he was the invigilator.\u201dGao Qi was confused: \u201cGenerally speaking, the invigilators wouldn\u2019t appear if you clear the exam normally.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cAppeared because I violated the rules.\u201dGao Qi again said with confusion: \u201cBut that would just involve putting you in the confinement room?\u201d\u201cViolated it several times.\u201dGao Qi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s here as a personal invigilator????\u201d Gao Qi was vigilant again.\u201cNo.\u201d You Huo said: \u201cWhen he did, he helped burn an exam centre down and is now demoted into an examinee.\u201d\u201cSo, what are you two now???\u201d Gao Qi rubbed his face. His head hurt.\u201cWe\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dYou Huo paused for a moment. He then glanced at Qin Jiu before looking back: \u201care friends.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThis time it was Qin Jiu\u2019s turn to feel hurt.He poked his cheek with his tongue. His expression was indecipherable.Gao Qi looked at Qin Jiu with slight surprise. His expression was a little complicated.Zhao Jiatong poked him lightly and mouthed: Memory loss.Gao Qi came to a realisation.He internally thought: That\u2019s right. He now believes that Qin Jiu really did lose his memory. If he didn\u2019t, he would rather die than mingle with Invigilator A. To even be friends\u2026\u2026.How big of a face slap would that be?!Invigilator A had lost his memories, 001 also lost his memories.So now they can peacefully know each other, peacefully get along, peacefully become friends\u2026\u2026He could understand\u2026\u2026As if!Gao Qi internally cursed.But taking into consideration Invigilator A\u2019s presence, he restrained himself.Reconciliation was impossible.Taking advantage of the moment Qin Jiu was distracted, he whispered to Zhao Jiatong: \u201cThings like friends are all nonsense. They can be like this because both their brains are damaged. Let\u2019s see what happens when they recover their memories.\u201dZhao Jiatong: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026You sure they can be recovered?\u201dGao Qi: \u201cWho knows? I have heard of some things\u2026\u2026.I\u2019ll get A to try it later.\u201dZhao Jiatong frowned: \u201cIs it reliable? Don\u2019t mess around. Do you think the system is dead?\u201dGao Qi pouted: \u201cI\u2019m an examinee now.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Not far away, horse carriages formed a circle and the coachmen adjusted their whips.You Huo said to Qin Jiu: \u201cI thought you were sent by the system to another exam.\u201d\u201cI thought so too, but I still tried looking around after getting off.\u201d Qin Jiu rearranged the coat he had removed and looked up at him with a chuckle: \u201cSeems my luck is pretty good.\u201dThe midsummer air was suddenly a little dry.You Huo licked his lips. He tucked his hands in his pockets and looked at the castle not far from them with narrowed eyes: \u201cDid you hear the exam question? This time in groups of two, I\u2014\u2014-\u201dAs he said this, Zhou Qi also got off.The coachman couldn\u2019t read the situation. He led the horse over to bid farewell: \u201cThe two couples have been dropped off. I will go back to town first. If you need anything, you can find me in town.\u201dHe turned to Zhou Qi and said: \u201cMadam, I\u2019ll just be a little nosy. When you\u2019re here, it\u2019s best not to stray too far from your husband.\u201dAfter saying that, he pushed Zhou Qi over and then ran off after saying goodbye.Zhou Qi was completely dumbfounded.Qin Jiu didn\u2019t speak. You Huo also didn\u2019t speak.After several seconds of silence, just as You Huo was about to speak, Qin Jiu turned his head and looked into the distance. A tall woman walked over and said: \u201cYou found you friend?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Qin Jiu replied. He turned and said to You Huo: \u201cThe system forced us into groups of two. I now also have a wife.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dAfter a while, he let out a grunt.Zhou Qi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dShe still can\u2019t figure out why she is standing here.All the coachmen soon left, leaving only pairs of \u201cmarried\u201d examinees outside in the stone square. They didn\u2019t know what the system was thinking.Overhead, thunder rumbled again.The castle gate opened, letting out a loud creak.A tall, thin old man wearing a suit walked out. His grey hair was meticulously combed into a small ponytail.He bowed to everyone and said: \u201cGood afternoon sir\u2019s and madam\u2019s. I am the head butler here, Douglas.\u201dPlease read this from kk translates\u201cThe Duke is feeling unwell and is currently resting after having afternoon tea. I will have your rooms arranged for you to take a short break. Dinner will be held as scheduled.\u201dAs he said that, he scanned his eyes across the large group of guests and then made a strange request: \u201cCome a pair at a time.\u201dAlthough the question mentioned that the plague was affecting them, the servants in the castle still worked very diligently. It was hard to tell that they were also suffering from this calamity. Douglas pulled out a piece of parchment paper and would make a note every time a pair of guests entered.Although it was unknown whether he was recording their number of guests or making a note next to their names, since he was an NPC he could surely distinguish between everyone after a once over.Unsurprisingly, the servants had arranged a room for each couple.Most of the examinees didn\u2019t dare say anything.In the exam, it was already good enough if they had a place to sleep. If there was a companion, it was even better. They weren\u2019t so particular about the gender factor.When he reached You Huo\u2019s end, Zhou Qi spoke up first: \u201cExcuse me\u2026\u2026.Can you give us two rooms?\u201dYou Huo looked at her with surprise.He naturally had considered it too, but it wasn\u2019t good saying it in front of the young lady with so many people around. He had planned to talk to Zhou Qi later and change rooms so that Zhou Qi could stay together with another woman.In a place like this, having two people was definitely safer than being alone.Unexpectedly, when the head butler Douglas heard this, he walked over and stared at Zhou Qi unblinkingly with his grey eyes: \u201cMy apologies, married couples must stay in the same room.\u201dZhou Qi: \u201c\u2026..Can\u2019t divorce?\u201dYou Huo frowned. He gently pushed Zhou Qi over to the side.And so, Douglas\u2019s eyes met with his.The old head butler said: \u201cThe Duke only accepts loving couples as guests. Singles are not accepted, separated couples are not accepted and divorced are naturally not accepted.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dHow did this madman live until now?The question had specified that they had to meet the Duke\u2019s requests, or the group would be punished.He didn\u2019t mind, but what about Zhou Qi in his group?And so, You Huo could only hold himself back and say to the head butler with a bad expression: \u201cGo on then.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..After a while, all the rooms were allocated.You Huo\u2019s room was located on the third floor near the east tower while Qin Jiu and that lady called Yang Shu was to his left, and Gao Qi and Zhao Jiatong was to his right.The room was quite large and was divided into inside and outside spaces. There were white curtains decorating the windows, dining table and chairs, a dressing table, a long leather bench, animal skin carpet and a bedroom and bathtub.The only problem was that there were not many washrooms in this castle, and they had to go to the first floor.Heavy curtains hanging above the bed covered the bed.Zhou Qi entered the room awkwardly and checked the bedroom first. She mumbled: \u201cDo you smell something?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dYou Huo was thinking about finding someone to change rooms with and was a little distracted.Zhou Qi lifted the curtain and sniffed it, but she shook her head. She then crouched next to the bed and sniffed it but again shook her head.\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u2026\u2026.There\u2019s some kind of bad smell.\u201dShe thought about it and said: \u201cSmells a little funky.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe young lady sniffed left and right and didn\u2019t even overlook the fan and chairs. She then rubbed her nose and said: \u201cCan\u2019t find the source. Maybe it\u2019s just my nose that\u2019s strange\u2026.But I am a little overly sensitive. It\u2019s probably a psychological thing.\u201dYou Huo asked for her opinion: \u201cThe two ladies on the right and left. Who would you choose?\u201dZhou Qi: \u201cHuh?\u201dShe froze for a moment before finally realising: \u201cOhhh, it\u2019s okay. Any is fine. Why not\u2026\u2026why not the right one then. We\u2019ve already chatted in the carriage today.\u201dYou Huo pursed his lips.Zhou Qi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dUh\u2026.Left\u2026\u2026.is also okay.Though the lady Yang Shu looks a little domineering\u2026\u2026.Just as she wanted to speak, You Huo turned and walked to the door.The door was made of wood. As it opened, it let out a weak creak.It was okay during the day but if one heard it at night\u2026\u2026It could cause people\u2019s hairs to stand.As soon as the door was opened, You Huo moved to walk out.He then saw two male servants come over from both sides and say: \u201cYou can\u2019t change rooms.\u201dThere were not only one on each side of the door, all the households along the street\u2026\u2026Ahem, all the rooms along the corridor had a servant standing outside.Zhou Qi was afraid of something happening to this handsome guy, so she quickly pulled him back: \u201cForget it, it\u2019s okay. At most we can take turns using the bed. Let\u2019s use scissors, paper, rock. Tonight, you can sleep on the bed and I\u2019ll sleep outside, and tomorrow I\u2019ll sleep on the bed and you can sleep outside. Anyway, there are doors and screens.\u201d\u201cNo need, you can sleep on the bed.\u201d You Huo said: \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter to me. Just a chair is enough.\u201dAs soon as he said that, there was a soft sound coming from the balcony.The two turned and saw Gao Qi creep in. He covered his face and said to You Huo: \u201cA, help me out. I don\u2019t dare stay in the same room as Zhao Jiatong. If I get drunk, it might affect her. Can I stay here with you? The NPCs are all guarding outside. I thought about it and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good doing something to the other party on the first day.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dGao Qi then looked at Zhou Qi and said: \u201cOh right. Young lady, I\u2019ve spoken to Zhao Jiatong. In a moment, she will pick you up from the balcony. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re very skilled. If you fall, I\u2019ll take responsibility.\u201dZhou Qi was flattered. She quickly nodded and said: \u201cI\u2019ll trouble you then.\u201dGao Qi bought the young lady over to his side first and then turned back to You Huo like a big dog: \u201cOkay?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.Okay.\u201dZhao Jiatong was a very agile woman, but they didn\u2019t expect Zhou Qi to also be very skilled.The young lady stepped onto the balcony and stepped across to the other side with her legs almost in a split before very flexibly flipping over.With the girls sorted, Gao Qi instantly relaxed.He hadn\u2019t seen his old friend in a very, very long time. Even if this old friend no longer remembers him, it was okay. Nothing can stop the power of friendship!Everything can be nurtured! In a life and death exam, we can have a chance to have a proper heart to heart talk\u2026\u2026..Oh right, Invigilator A doesn\u2019t like talking.He could just talk onesidedly. That was fine too.Gao Qi entered the bedroom and hung his coat on the hanger.He then walked out, found a rustic silver cup on the table and poured himself some water. Just as he took a sip, he heard a soft sound coming from the balcony.You Huo was in the middle of moving a screen across and was kicking it in place.Hearing the sound, he looked over at the balcony.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d You Huo asked.Qin Jiu squatted on the stone railing of the balcony with his arms hanging loosely. He looked a little frivolous.This man had a liking for dangerous spots and wasn\u2019t afraid of falling.\u201cChecking the situation out.\u201d He then dragged his voice and asked You Huo: \u201cIs the lady in?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026..No.\u201dQin Jiu raised his lips and smiled.Using one hand to support himself, he jumped off the stone railing and joked: \u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019m here to have an affair with you.\u201dPfftt\u2014\u2014\u2014-Behind the screen, Gao Qi spat out his water.Qin Jiu narrowed his eyes: \u201cYou\u2019re even hiding someone?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dAre you possessed by something?Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: OMG Qin Jiu \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The air from his movements caused the fire in the lamp to flicker. The room dimmed and brightened as a result.When You Huo looked back, he happened to meet Qin Jui\u2019s eyes.The other party suddenly snorted. It was a soft and quiet snort.It was as if he really was a lover who was just thrown aside.Behind the screen, Gao Qi coughed a few times again and carefully wiped the table down.The sound wasn\u2019t very loud, but at this moment it sounded a little noisy\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201cHuh, you\u2019re actually standing there properly.\u201d Gao Qi suddenly said.You Huo broke eye contact.\u201cWhat standing?\u201dHe looked over at the screen.Gao Qi who was done cleaning stepped out from behind the screen. With a towel in his hand, he pointed at Qin Jiu with his chin, \u201cI was talking about him. He actually entered properly.\u201d\u201cWhy? I can\u2019t enter properly? Then how should I enter?\u201d asked Qin Jiu.\u201cWhile dreaming.\u201d Gao Qi said.He glanced at You Huo and mumbled, \u201cHis temper has improved after losing his memory\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe remembered Invigilator A\u2019s icy cold expressions during the meetings back then. If he was able to patiently listen the other party\u2019s idiotic ramblings, it meant that he was in a pretty good mood. If anyone came over to him and said \u201cI\u2019m here to have an affair with you\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026..My god, he would probably throw a glass of water across and tell them to calm down first before speaking.Gao Qi grinned and flashed his teeth. He said to Qin Jiu: \u201cIf it was the past, do you believe that he would have kicked you down on the spot?\u201dQin Jiu threw his coat onto the chair and nodded while he unbuttoned his cuff buttons: \u201cI do. I can imagine it.\u201dAs he said this, he looked up at You Huo: \u201cHe\u2019s pretty fierce.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dGao Qi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dFor some reason, Gao Qi felt it sounded a little strange. It seemed to carry some other meaning.He had said it only to stop this person from taking things too far.But the one involved didn\u2019t say anything.Can you not be so high and mighty even at a time like this?For a moment, Gao Qi felt like he was living like a eunuch.He wanted to reveal all the past details to the two, but he also felt that if he nagged too much he would be more like a eunuch.In fact, he understood inside that since these two knew their own and each other\u2019s identity, they must have also heard of bits and pieces of their past.They\u2019re all adults. Since they didn\u2019t have an issue with being partners, why should he waste his effort convincing them otherwise?Afterall, it was always better to have more friends and less trouble during the exams.When was he ever so naggy?Never!He would only do this for his friend A.Perhaps it was because when something happened to A back then, he wasn\u2019t able to do anything and felt a little guilty\u2026\u2026.Or perhaps it was because he was a little overwhelmed after seeing his old friend again, he worried about him like a mother.Mother Gao angrily poured himself a second cup of water and sat down in a chair. He heard You Huo ask Qin Jiu: \u201cYou want to stay here?\u201d\u201cCan I stay?\u201d Qin Jiu asked.You Huo then indicated next door with his chin, \u201cYour wife is alone?\u201dHearing him ask this, Qin Jiu laughed.Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen. Please don\u2019t support those thieves, the translator KK is going to cry\u2026\u201cMiss Yang is very reluctant to share with others. She said that neither men nor women will do.\u201d He shrugged, \u201cI told her that if something happened, she can just give me a shout.\u201dA woman of this character was quite rare. It was rather surprising.Qin Jiu looked at You Huo again.He was already here but he still insisted on asking: \u201cSo can I stay?\u201dGao Qi guzzled down his water and gnashed his teeth.He internally thought: They\u2019re both friends but why was their treatment so different?But overall, he was a little friendlier to him. After just explaining it with a sentence or two, A agreed. Everything was settled quickly and easily.What was all this nonsense about the wife\u2026\u2026\u2026.You Huo looked at Qin Jiu: \u201cBed is mine.\u201d\u201cWith such a big bed, why don\u2019t you consider giving me half?\u201d Qin Jiu said.Gao Qi: \u201c???\u201d\u201cI mean, shouldn\u2019t this be a matter of first come first served?\u201d He interrupted.Qin Jiu leaned against the back of the chair and turned to look at him: \u201cWhy?\u201dGao Qi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dOne was said to be a friend of many years and the other was just\u2026..a friend.In short, this matchup was very troublesome.You Huo looked at the two and thought of a compromise, \u201cForget it. I\u2019ll sleep outside. You two can take the bed.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c?\u201dGao Qi: \u201c???\u201dIt was still too early for dinner. Thunder clapped and lighting flashed outside. Once again, it started to rain.Gao Qi yawned several times making even You Huo and Qin Jiu sleepy.\u201cI can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m going to take a nap.\u201dGao Qi mumbled as he entered the bedroom.You Huo got ready to settle in a chair when he heard Gao Qi say: \u201cForget it. I\u2019ll sleep outside instead.\u201dWhat was wrong now?It\u2019s just sleeping so why was there so many issues?You Huo looked over with a frown. He saw Gao Qi point to the bed and say: \u201cI suggest that we all sleep on the ground tonight. The colour of the bed isn\u2019t right.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean the colour of the bed isn\u2019t right?\u201dThey walked into the bedroom, pulled open the heavy curtains and saw that the entire bed including the sheets and the blankets were stained reddish brown.\u201cThe lamp here is a little dim so I don\u2019t know if you can tell.\u201d Gao Qi pointed at the dark red bed and said, \u201cLooks like blood. The dried-up kind.\u201dQin Jiu touched the blankets.You Huo picked up a corner of it and smelt it.Gao Qi internally wondered how these two could touch it without any hesitation.\u201cAny smell?\u201dYou Huo shook his head, \u201cNo.\u201dThere was no smell coming from the blanket apart from a very light floral fragrance. It was as if the colour of the bed was dyed using various flowers.\u201cI don\u2019t think it should smell much. If it was that obvious, we should smell it as soon as we entered.\u201d Gao Qi said.You Huo suddenly recalled Zhou Qi\u2019s words. She had walked around the bedroom a few times saying that she smelt something bad.He told the other two about this and Gao Qi immediately started to sniff around.Qin Jiu on the other hand circled around the room.\u201cI still don\u2019t smell it. Maybe that chick has a keen sense of smell. Anyway, no matter whether it smells or not, from my experience anything that looks like blood is usually nothing good. It\u2019s better not to touch it.\u201dThey warned the others in the rooms on their left and right.Zhao Jiatong said: \u201cI didn\u2019t notice at first. It was Xiao Zhao who told me that there was a strange smell in the room.\u201dXiao Zhou said: \u201cI inherited a dog\u2019s nose.\u201dYang Shu on the other hand let out an oh, gave her thanks and went back into her room.The three women all have different personalities. Gao Qi muttered this and retracted his head.They avoided the bedroom, and each found a place to nap.The thunderstorm outside continued. Rain hitting the stone railing caused splattering sounds.As the moist air entered, the sultry heat in the room lessened slightly.After an unknown period of time passed, a small chill that wasn\u2019t normal for a midsummer\u2019s night swept through.It was like\u2026\u2026..a small drop of ice water landing onto the back of your neck and then sliding down your back.Gao Qi who was sleeping on the table suddenly twitched. He rubbed the hairs on the back of his neck.While still half asleep, he raised his head.The room was dim. The fire in the lamps had gone out at some unknown point in time. Only the one in the bedroom gently swayed. It illuminated through the curtain and revealed the big bed inside.There was a person sitting on the bed.It didn\u2019t move.Fuck.Gao Qi was startled awake.He rubbed his face and reached over to the man sitting in the chair nearby.Please read this from kk translatesAfter patting him three times, You Huo was still lying there with his arms blocking the light and half his face covered. He continued to sleep deeply.Gao Qi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHis lips twitched a few times. He then reached back and patted the other person.Qin Jiu who sat in the armchair had one hand supporting his head and was similarly in deep sleep.Gao Qi swore internally.He stiffened his back and quietly clenched his fists.The fire suddenly flickered. The figure in the curtain disappeared for a moment and the curtain was no longer transparent.Gao Qi heard the rustling of fabric. It sounded like the thing on the bed was moving.When the fire was back on again, the curtain was swaying gently under the light.Gao Qi could now see that the person sitting on the bed was a woman. Her hair was tied up very high and her neck and shoulder that was exposed from her dress was dazzlingly pale.She seemed to hear the breathing outside and looked over.But strangely, her act of turning her head was very stiff, and very slow. It was as if her head would fall off if she did it any faster\u2026..Gao Qi was frightened by this wild imagination of his.He twisted his lips and dismissed that thought from his mind before making eye contact with that woman.Through the curtain, he couldn\u2019t really tell if the other party was actually looking at him.He could only see an extremely pale face with fuzzy features as well as a pair of dark, hollow eyes.She blinked her eyes.Suddenly, her entire body crumbled.Her arms and legs scattered, and her head fell and rolled under the bed. With her lips facing up and her eyes below, she continued to stare his way.Gao Qi immediately jumped up.But it wasn\u2019t to run away.It was frightening but he had plenty of experience and knew that in a situation like this, it was safer facing it than turning his back and running.He picked up a chair and rushed straight for the bedroom.The head had already rolled under the bed. He smashed the chair onto the bed, pulled his coat off from the hanger and waved it near the fire lamp.The fire shook violently and was almost extinguished by this act of his.His coat caught on fire and instantly started to burn.Gao Qi threw the burning mass under the bed.Generally speaking, the head under the bed would be driven away by the fire and all he needed to do was to deal with the limbs on the bed.But when he pulled open the curtain, it was empty.The chair fell to the ground making a loud clatter.The limbs were all gone. He froze and suddenly squatted down.There was only a burning coat under the bed. No head could be seen.Gao Qi stiffened.Suddenly a hand patted his shoulder.\u201cFuck\u2014\u2014-\u201dHe was startled, and immediately threw a punch back.In the end, his fist was caught by someone and his arm was then twisted behind him.In just a few moves, he was pushed down onto the ground.Just as he was about to curse out, cold water was poured over his head.Gao Qi was startled. He closed his eyes and opened them again.He then saw that the room was bright. The fire in the fireplace gently flickered.As if everything he saw earlier was a dream, it disappeared without a trace.Qin Jiu had his knee pressed against his back and was looking down at him. You Huo held an empty cup. He said: \u201cAre you awake now?\u201dGao Qi was stupefied.He broke away from Qin Jiu\u2019s grip. Two red marks were left on his wrist.\u201cWhen I woke up, I saw you sitting on the bed holding a knife in your hand about to cut your own head off.\u201d Qin Jiu said.\u201cNo, I saw a woman. Her head fell under the bed. I grabbed a coat, set it alight and tried to burn her.\u201d Gao Qi pointed until the bed, \u201cI threw it he\u2014\u2013\u201dHuh?His words stopped. There was only a fallen knife on the ground and there was a small bloodstain on the edge of the knife.His coat on the other hand was still on the hanger.Gao Qi got up and touched his neck. His hand was covered in blood.While they all looked at each other, someone knocked on the wooden door.The head butler Douglas\u2019s voice spoke: \u201cSir and Madam, I\u2019m here to inform you that dinner will soon start. The Duke has always liked to be traditional so you will need to change into formal attire. The lord also has a custom. He would like all guests to wear masks to help keep Easter\u2026..a little more sacred.As he spoke, the door creaked open.A servant came in holding two sets of formal clothing. Qin Jiu quickly hid behind the bedroom door.The servant looked around, hung the clothes on the screen and walked over back to the door to wait.\u201cPlease change into these as soon as you can. I will lead you there when you\u2019re done.\u201dQin Jiu opened the bedroom door and looked out.On the screen hung a set of male formal attire from another century that was both exquisite and elegant.There was also a particularly gorgeous dress\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dQin Jiu again closed the door.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Who\u2019s gonna wear the dress?? \ud83d\ude09Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Who\u2019s wearing it?\u201d He turned to the other two in the room and wiggled his brows.As he did that, he saw that those two were looking at him with a terrifying look.How terrifying was it?It was to the point that he could tell that if he remained here any longer, that dress would be wrapped around his neck.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dGao Qi immediately stored away his smile and escaped.\u201cI\u2019ll see you at dinner!\u201d He then flipped across the balcony and escaped next door with vitality of a fifteen-year-old.He had slipped away too fast.

He raised his eyebrow and said: \u201cWhich wife is changing?\u201dIf he was just teasing, then that was fine, but this bastard even held the dress up and compared it with You Huo\u2019s body. He made a \u2018mm\u2019 sound of satisfaction.Mm your grandma!He held Gao Qi\u2019s \u201cself-beheading\u201d knife and pointed the tip of it to the room next door: \u201cScram back next door and change.\u201dQin Jiu placed down the dangerous object with a smile and jumped off the balcony.This old castle was huge.As the pairs of guests walked out of their rooms wearing formal attires and masks, for a moment they couldn\u2019t help but feel as if there was a problem with time and space and that the other guests were actual noblemen from another century.Zhou Qi who was looking around and taking in the layout inside the castle slowly moved closer to You Huo.You Huo glanced at her: \u201cScared?\u201dZhou Qi smiled meekly: \u201cAll the clothes are almost the same and the masks are similar so I can\u2019t tell who is who. When I looked at you from a distance, I thought you were someone from here and I was an examinee who had snuck in. It\u2019s a little scary\u2026\u2026\u201dYou Huo leaned against the stone wall of the corridor and watched the people coming and going below. He didn\u2019t appear to have any intention to leave.The male servant urged: \u201cSir, madam, I\u2019ll take you to the dining hall.\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t even look up: \u201cWaiting for someone.\u201dThe male servant said: \u201cThe dinner banquet is about to begin.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cOh.\u201dMale servant: \u201cThe Duke is waiting for you.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cThen he can wait.\u201dMale servant: \u201cThe lady is already here, who are you waiting for?\u201dAs an NPC, he didn\u2019t seem to understand relationships other than \u201cmarried couples\u201d.You Huo didn\u2019t pay him any attention.The male servant then said: \u201cYou can go to the dining hall first to wait.\u201dYou Huo pretended to be deaf.Male servant: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs they spoke, the wooden door next door creaked open.Qin Jiu who pushed the door open saw You Huo stand by the side of the corridor.The formal clothes he wore made him look tall and straight, and when he turned his head, the material at his waist wrinkled slightly. The mask covering the upper half of his face was intricate and delicate, a direct contrast to his cold lower half of his face.Please read this from kk translatesQin Jiu\u2019s footsteps stopped.At that moment, he suddenly felt that the collar around You Huo\u2019s neck was too tight.So much that he wanted to go over and pull open the top button, rip off the mask and either bite or kiss him. In any case, he wanted to do something to break up that contrast and make those cold lips show some other emotions.Perhaps it was because the lights above them were dim and ambiguous.He actually felt that a You Huo like that wasn\u2019t unfamiliar, and he could even imagine how the other party would look when he could no longer maintain that cold and indifferent look.It was almost as if he had seen it before.But it was just almost.That subtle feeling passed through him fleetingly. Very quickly, it disappeared like an illusion.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cAre you ready now?\u201d The male servant asked again. He was expressionless but his eyes revealed some discomfort, like he was ready to cry on the spot if You Huo didn\u2019t move.You Huo hummed in response and straightened up.He saw Qin Jiu tug at his collar and walk over unhurriedly. Qin Jiu opened his mouth to say something.At this moment, the other door also opened. Gao Qi walked out awkwardly. As he tugged at his sleeves, he complained to Zhao Jiatong: \u201cThis thing is really uncomfortable to wear. The collar is not a collar, the waist is not a waist. Are they bullying me because my neck is short\u2026\u2026..Huh? Are you waiting for me?\u201dHe looked over at You Huo while straightening his clothes.You Huo paused. He then nodded at Gao Qi: \u201cHurry up.\u201dGao Qi was moved.Master You felt guilty.They lived the furthest away and they took their time changing so by the time they started heading off, there were no other examinees left on the third floor.The three pairs of guests actually have three servants leading the way.The three servants walked very quickly. If they could, they would probably choose to drag the examinees over.The overall colour tone of the castle was dark.The Duke seemed to have a special liking for colours similar to blood. All the curtains and tablecloths were this colour.About every ten metres, there would be an oil painting on the corridor wall.It was a painting of a family of three.A woman in a red dress sat in an armchair with her left elbow resting on the armrest. Her snow-white neck and shoulders were delicate and beautiful, and she looked gentle and dignified\u2026..In her right hand she held a mask which covered the upper half of her face.Her exposed lips were bright red and plump. The corners of her lips were raised as she smiled.Standing next to her was a young boy. His hair was combed meticulously, and he wore an exquisite formal suit. He had one hand on the woman\u2019s wrist and he also held a mask in his other hand.Behind the mother and son stood a tall, thin man. He was bending forwards slightly and had both his arms propped onto the back of the armchair. He similarly held a mask to cover his face and his lips formed a smile.This was likely the Duke\u2019s family.But now the wife and child had died, leaving only the Duke behind.The three male servants led them through several corridors and past several empty rooms before finally reaching the end.At the end was a tall and magnificent door. Voices of people strategizing could be vaguely heard through the door.A servant looked at the time and heaved a sigh of relief. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, we\u2019re on time.\u201dHe pushed the guests through the door and left.***In the dining hall, a long table travelled from one end of the room to the other. It was enough for 13 groups of examinees to sit down and eat and there were even spare seats.The very last few seats were probably left for You Huo and the others. The man sitting at the head of the table should be the Duke.Although the head butler Douglas called him \u201cMaster\u201d here and \u201cMaster\u201d there, he wasn\u2019t old and was actually very young.He looked around\u2026\u2026.twenty years old.A dozen or so children dressed in snow white formal attire and identical masks stood on a platform in the corner singing.The Duke looked over at You Huo and the others and knocked on his glass with a silver spoon.He \u201cshh\u201dd and the entire hall quietened.\u201cDouglas, are these guests late?\u201d The Duke asked the head butler beside him.His voice was strange. It was as if he was accustomed to speaking in a low voice and was deliberately suppressing it. It was a little hoarse and it wasn\u2019t very comfortable to listen to.Douglas shook his head: \u201cNo Master. They came just in time.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u2026..\u201d The Duke nodded.Although he looked young, he didn\u2019t behave like a young man. Perhaps it was because he had grown used to being the superior one and acted accordingly.\u201cNot late\u2026\u2026.\u201d The Duke repeated softly.He smiled and said: \u201cThen sit down. The wine is all there. Don\u2019t hold back.\u201dThe food on the table was very alluring.With a quick glance, you could see clear water beads clinging to the glass glistening under the lights. The skin of the roasted chicken was crisp and brown, and it exuded a strong, delicious aroma\u2026\u2026It was a sharp contrast to the dry bread that was provided in the carriage.The examinees almost couldn\u2019t hold back.But they didn\u2019t dare eat.After taking several exams, they had become very vigilant.You Huo however immediately picked up the wine and took a seat after sitting down.Zhou Qi let out an \u201cah\u201d but didn\u2019t stop him.\u201cYou\u2019re really drinking?\u201d She glanced over at the Duke and whispered.You Huo: \u201cYou drink when you\u2019re thirsty. What\u2019s the problem?\u201dThe food this time was much better than the food in previous exams. The skill was on par to 922\u2019s so he naturally could swallow it down.\u201cBut\u2026\u2026.\u201dZhou Qi felt that she wasn\u2019t a friend yet so she couldn\u2019t stop him. She turned to Qin Jiu to ask for his help.In the end, Qin Jiu had actually drunk a little more than You Huo.Zhou Qi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Duke laughed joyfully: \u201cI like guests like these\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe then turned to Douglas and said: \u201cI like it. I don\u2019t mind letting them stay here longer.\u201dDouglas nodded and said: \u201cUnderstood, Master.\u201dThe examinees closest to the Duke overhead this and hesitated for a few seconds before also starting to eat.Human\u2019s were like this. As long as there were two or three taking the lead, the others would quickly join in.In a blink of an eye, those who only swirled their wine glasses around but didn\u2019t drink took a small sip. When they felt that it didn\u2019t taste strange, they started to pick up their knives and forks.At this moment, the door opened again.A pair of man and woman hurried in. The man\u2019s formal attire was incorrectly buttoned making him look dishevelled and pathetic.The woman\u2019s dress also wasn\u2019t arranged properly. Shrinking behind the man, she held his hand a little nervously.You Huo glanced at them. He internally thought that the system didn\u2019t seem to be a complete rogue. At least not all \u201cmarried couples\u201d were forced together. Some were probably real couples.Even if they\u2019re not couples, with the accompaniment of the life and death exams, there would at least be a bit of a suspension bridge effect.Please read this from kk translatesThe Duke placed down his glass and turned to ask the head butler: \u201cDouglas, this pair of guests should be late, right?\u201dDouglas nodded: \u201cYes, Master.\u201dHis old eyes looked over at the pair of examinees. He then added: \u201cQuite late.\u201dThe Duke nodded: \u201cI see.\u201dHis voice wasn\u2019t very loud.But the hall was extremely silent. With the others remaining silent and not interrupting, it sounded especially clear.That pair of examinees immediately started to tremble. Their faces turned pale.The Duke raised his hand and said: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t be afraid. I was just asking out of habit. Here, sit here. We left you a seat. The wine is already prepared.\u201dThe man patted the woman\u2019s hand, took a deep breath and built up his courage before walking over to the long table.There were indeed two empty seats beside the Duke. They looked like they were specially prepared for late guests.Zhou Qi continued to stare at the Duke. A moment later, she whispered to You Huo: \u201cI know those two examinees. We were together in the first round. The man is called Zhang Pengyi and the woman is called He Jiajia. They were a couple and their relationship was pretty good\u2026\u2026..\u201dShe said this and then looked at the Duke again: \u201cMy boyfriend was originally here too but unfortunately we got separated in the second exam.\u201dYou Huo asked her: \u201cHow many have you done?\u201dZhou Qi said: \u201cThis is my fourth one.\u201dHer results were barely okay. It was enough to let her hold onto a small sliver of hope. Her boyfriend was a little better than her so as long as he didn\u2019t run into any strange exams, he should perform better than her. Once five exams are done\u2026\u2026\u2026perhaps they could get out together.As she spoke, she continued to stare at the Duke.You Huo asked: \u201cAre you afraid of him?\u201dZhou Qi froze. She shook her head and then nodded: \u201cI am afraid. He\u2019s the subject of question. Who knows what he would do? But I\u2019m always looking at him because\u2026\u2026his lips look a little like my boyfriends. I miss him.\u201dShe grievously drank some wine. She then glanced at You Huo and then at Qin Jiu.With a long sigh, she said: \u201cI miss him more now.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHalfway through the delicious meal, the Duke knocked on his glass again: \u201cThank you everyone for coming all this way to accompany me in remembering my Alyssa and Colin. I believe\u2026\u2026.I believe they will be very moved if they knew about this. I heard from Douglas that you promised to treat the townspeople here.\u201dHe paused and then said in a gentle voice: \u201cThose poor people. I thank you in their stead.\u201d\u201cDouglas will arrange for the carriages to take you to town during the day but be sure to return by nightfall. I can\u2019t do much so please give me this chance to provide you with delicious meals and warm beds.\u201dAfter he said this, he suddenly turned his head aside and coughed a few times.It was stifled but his entire body shook with each cough. It was as if he was trying his best to suppress his cough.Douglas supported him.He used a tablecloth to wipe his mouth. When he turned back, his lips were bright red.The people sitting at the table quietly gasped.The Duke said: \u201cI have been feeling a little unwell the past few days. It\u2019s something small, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cAh yes, while everyone stays here, please don\u2019t take of the mask.\u201d The Duke suddenly added: \u201cIt\u2019s neat and beautiful like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWho wants to look neat?This Duke probably has OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder).But because everyone had mentally prepared themselves in advance and knew that this Duke must have some strange quirks, they didn\u2019t take it to heart.The Duke then said: \u201cMy house is a little big. You can easily get lost at night. It\u2019s better to drink more wine so that you can have a good night\u2019s sleep without needing to get up in the middle of the night.\u201dHe gently laughed: \u201cThere is also another request. As I have said just now, I am feeling a little unwell. My sleep quality at night isn\u2019t very good so I do not want to be disturbed. If there are any friends who like to get up in the middle of the night, please don\u2019t go to the first floor of the west tower. My temper isn\u2019t good when I don\u2019t sleep well and I don\u2019t want to offend anyone.\u201dEveryone nodded. They started to feel a little scared.But the fine wine and good food was very alluring, and the Duke behaved very courteously. Soon afterwards, the examinees once again buried their heads in the food.The children\u2019s singing acted as background music. The light and feathery voices made people feel a little sleepy.But everyone struggled to stay awake and chatted amongst themselves.The examination question this time was a little strange. Usually something would happen on the first day or some hidden exam requirements would be revealed.Or at least some punishments would be enforced for the group in last place.But this time it was very strange. Nothing happened.Gao Qi mumbled something to Zhao Jiatong before grabbing a bread and turning around to ask You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026.A, what do you think?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI just discussed with Zhao Jiatong. Should we go to town to check out the situation tomorrow or use the opportunity while everyone is away to investigate this castle.? The Duke is probably going to be troublesome so it\u2019s better not to provoke him for the time being.\u201dHe had told Zhao Jiatong about his dream and it had been constantly on his mind.He felt that this castle was 120% strange.\u201cZhao Jiatong votes to go to the town first because it\u2019s safer. I voted to investigate the castle. Which would you vote for?\u201dYou Huo said: \u201cI want to check out the invigilator\u2019s quarter first.\u201dZhao Jiatong: \u201c?\u201dGao Qi: \u201c???\u201d\u201cI mean\u2026\u2026.What did the invigilator\u2019s quarter do for you to want to check them out first?\u201d Gao Qi didn\u2019t understand.He turned and looked at Qin Jiu before rubbing his nose and asking angrily: \u201cWhat about you? Zhao Jiatong wants to go to town first, I want to investigate the castle first and A over here wants to visit the invigilator\u2019s quarter. There\u2019s one vote for each of them. It\u2019s up to you now.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cI want to provoke the Duke.\u201dGao Qi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWhy did he have to take the exam with these two psychopaths?Not far away at the head of the table the Duke covered his mouth and coughed a few more times. He then turned to the late examinees Zhang Pengyi and He Jiajia and said softly: \u201cAre you free tonight?\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Oops.

Along the way, Zhou Qi was a little absentminded.\u201cXiao Zhou, are you okay? Your expression doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d Zhao Jiatong asked worriedly.\u201cThe mask is covering it, yet you can see that her expression doesn\u2019t look good?\u201d Gao Qi had once again drunk until his tongue was loose.\u201cCan\u2019t you see the pale lips?\u201d Zhao Jiatong pushed him aside, \u201cYou move over.\u201dYou Huo and Qin Jiu who walked in front turned around when they heard this.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dZhou Qi hesitated for a few seconds.A ridiculous thought appeared in her mind \u2014\u2014- The Duke\u2019s look earlier seemed to be warning her not to drink the wine.But it really was a ridiculous thought.As the exam subject NPC, the Duke who shouldn\u2019t be a good person would give her a warning like that? Even if he was to give a warning, why would he only warn her?It didn\u2019t make sense.Moreover, the two great masters ahead ate and drank without a worry. Perhaps it was because they were experienced and powerful, they didn\u2019t appear to be concerned.Gao Qi in particular drank a lot.If she told them now that the wine might be problematic, wasn\u2019t that too late?Zhou Qi swallowed the words back down and shook her head: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I just don\u2019t like it here. I don\u2019t feel comfortable staying here for too long. I\u2019m a little scared.\u201dYang Shu said lukewarmly: \u201cDidn\u2019t eat or drink. Probably hungry.\u201dZhou Qi internally said: I\u2019m really not hungry\u2026\u2026But she didn\u2019t want to mess with this domineering big sister and just nodded: \u201cProbably.\u201dZhao Jiatong kicked Gao Qi: \u201cDidn\u2019t you go to the rest stop before you came? Did you buy food?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Gao Qi dug out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and said innocently, \u201cJust bought this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..You\u2019re useless.\u201d Zhao Jiatong said: \u201cIt\u2019s either alcohol or cigarettes. Can\u2019t you have a good habit?\u201dGao Qi was used to her nagging and wasn\u2019t angry. He just raised his hand and surrendered: \u201cAlright, alright, I won\u2019t smoke. You happy now?\u201dAs he said that, he stuffed the cigarettes into You Huo\u2019s pocket.\u201cHere, my gift.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cI don\u2019t smoke.\u201dGao Qi then dug out a lighter and passed it over: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you smoke either but don\u2019t you always have a habit of bringing a pack whenever you supervise an exam?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Zhao Jiatong was curious.Although they were all people who had followed Invigilator A in the past, it didn\u2019t mean that they were close.In any case, Zhao Jiatong used to be a little afraid of him. Curious, but afraid.Gao Qi next to her answered: \u201cHow should I know?\u201dAs he said that, he secretly glanced at Invigilator A himself.You Huo didn\u2019t even raise his head.Gao Qi looked at Zhao Jiatong and spread his hands. He mouthed: Don\u2019t ask anymore. Probably forgot.Gao Qi and Zhao Jiatong sighed.As You Huo was about to store the lighter away, two slender fingers suddenly reached over and took it away.He knew it was Qin Jiu just by looking at the hand.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cA little curious. Borrowing to take a look.\u201dQin Jiu walked next to him and spun the lighter between his fingers. He suddenly asked: \u201cIn the past, was there someone who would always borrow the lighter from you?\u201dPerhaps it was because his voice was too low, or perhaps it was because he was very close, You Huo\u2019s heart trembled.It was as if something he had long forgotten was brought up. He suddenly had a faint impression of it.He looked at the object in Qin Jiu\u2019s hand: \u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cBecause you asked me if I smoked.\u201dAs Qin Jiu said this, he looked up at him.You Huo remained silent for a moment. He took the lighter back and stored it in his pocket: \u201cYou said you don\u2019t smoke.\u201dQin Jiu stopped. You Huo didn\u2019t stop. In a blink of an eye, he had walked ahead.Gao Qi and Zhao Jiatong who were bickering looked up and wondered: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why did you suddenly stop?\u201dQin Jiu rubbed his empty fingertips together and looked up: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just thinking about something.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Gao Qi looked around: \u201cDid you find something?\u201d\u201cHas nothing to do with the exam.\u201d Qin Jiu paused and added: \u201cA private matter.\u201d***The Duke\u2019s wine worked very well.As soon as everyone returned and quietly changed rooms, they soon began to feel sleepy.In the middle of the night, the castle was silent.Holding a lamp, Butler Douglas stood before a room on the second floor and knocked a few times.After a while, the door opened.The man scratched his head and asked sleepily: \u201cWho is it\u2014\u2014-\u201dThe old head butler was old and his skin sagged. The light from the oil lamp illuminated his face from the bottom, startling the person who opened the door.It wasn\u2019t anyone else. It was Zhang Pengyi who was late for dinner.\u201cM-Mister Butler?\u201dDouglas nodded and said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir for disturbing your sleep.\u201dZhang Pengyi rubbed his face. His fingers trembled slightly.He didn\u2019t want to sleep.The Duke\u2019s question during the dinner banquet scared him. He and Jiajia were extremely afraid and didn\u2019t plan on sleeping but they somehow fell asleep and now he had somehow woken up.\u201cDo\u2026..Do you need something?\u201d Zhang Pengyi glanced into the room.Strangely, he had woken but Jiajia was still sleeping deeply.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netIt wasn\u2019t like this before. Jiajia would wake up as soon as he rolls over.Douglas said slowly: \u201cI don\u2019t know if sir still remembers, the Duke said he would like to see you tonight.\u201dJust this sentence made Zhang Pengyi\u2019s heart fall.\u201cCan\u2019t it be tomorrow during the day?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I think it\u2019s better that you go now.\u201dZhang Pengyi glanced down the corridor.There were clearly many people in this castle but right now it was extremely quiet.There were no sounds of human voices nor any sounds of snoring.He remembered the Duke\u2019s reminder during dinner. It was as if everyone here would automatically fall into deep sleep at night.Not only that, the servants who were standing outside during the day were also gone.The fireplace in the corridor was almost completely extinguished. Only the flickering light from the lamp in the old butler\u2019s hand was left.Zhang Pengyi felt cold sweat roll down his back.Anxious, he opened his mouth and shouted: \u201cHEL\u2014\u2014\u201dBefore he could finish that word, the slow butler suddenly lashed out and smashed his head with an iron rod.Zhang Pengyi\u2019s call for help abruptly stopped and he crumbled to the ground.On the big bed in the room, He Jiajia continued to sleep. It was as if she was deaf. She was completely unaware of what was happening.The old housekeeper returned to his expressionless look. He reached out and grabbed Zhang Pengyi\u2019s collar.The back of his hand was covered in wrinkles. Purple and green veins could be seen on his pale skin.He was clearly old and frail, but he dragged Zhang Pengyi along with no changes to his expression.In the corridor, only the rustling of clothing fabric rubbing against the ground could be heard. This continued from the second floor to the first floor before finally stopping before a bedroom in the west tower.The old butler knocked on the door.The Duke\u2019s voice came from inside. It was very soft and very hoarse: \u201cIs it Douglas?\u201d\u201cWho else could it be, Master?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a little slow today.\u201d\u201cSorry, Master.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dThe door creaked open. Two male servants held the door open expressionlessly. It was as if they didn\u2019t see the old head butler drag a person in.The Duke stood there with his mask.It was clearly the middle of summer, but he rubbed his hands like he was cold.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I have all the patience in the world for you.\u201d The Duke said softly, \u201cWhat can I do without you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll always be there.\u201dDouglas dragged Zhang Pengyi into the large bedroom.The Duke followed behind him, still warming his hands by rubbing them together. A smile rested at his lips. It was a little like the person in the oil painting, but it was also\u2026\u2026\u2026not exactly the same.He said to the other servants without looking back: \u201cLeave.\u201dThe two servants moved as directed. After leaving, they closed the bedroom door behind them.Douglas threw Zhang Pengyi into an armchair. He slowly brought over a pile of candles and lit them one by one.The Duke stood in front of the armchair. He took off Zhang Pengyi\u2019s mask, pinched his chin and assessed him.He snorted and said: \u201cI don\u2019t really like this face. You even damaged it.\u201d\u201cSorry, Master.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We don\u2019t need to use it. But I also don\u2019t like his figure.\u201d The Duke then unbuttoned the other party\u2019s shirt.He coughed a few times. His lips were stained with blood. He said regretfully: \u201cBut never mind. My heart can\u2019t last any longer.\u201d***Zhang Pengyi suddenly felt a chill. Soon afterwards, it was a splitting headache.He vaguely heard some voices and was then startled awake.He found himself sitting in an unfamiliar room surrounded by a ring of white candles and some dry branches.He had watched his fair share of TV dramas so the first thing that came to mind was something along the lines of medieval witchcraft.But the next second, those thoughts were gone.Because fear had prevailed \u2014\u2014- He found himself unable to move.The old butler Douglas stood outside the circle while the Duke stood in front of him inside the circle.The other party leaned down and stared at him through the holes in the mask.Zhang Pengyi smelled something strange.It was rotten and cold\u2026\u2026The Duke smiled.If you looked at it from a close distance, you would see that his smile was very stiff and not very well controlled. He could only move the corners of his lips.\u201cLook at me.\u201d The Duke said.His eyes seemed to have the power to bewitch. Zhang Pengyi inexplicably became a little dazed.\u201cKind-hearted guest, would you do me a favour?\u201d The Duke asked softly.Zhang Pengyi opened his mouth.His mouth and brain seemed to be separated. He wanted to say \u201cno\u201d but his lips instead said \u201cyes\u201d.He struggled with himself. His eyes rolled up as he struggled, making him look both pathetic and pitiful.The Duke clicked his tongue and murmured: \u201cIt\u2019s even uglier.\u201dZhang Pengyi didn\u2019t hear it.He felt pressure around his chin again. When his eyes once again met with the other person\u2019s eyes, he gradually stopped struggling.After a moment, he said with a blank expression: \u201cI will.\u201dThe Duke smiled: \u201cMany thanks.\u201d***There were muffled noises in the bedroom. It sounded like something was plunged into flesh.It only stopped after a while.And then it was the sound of something heavy being dragged.A mirror with intricate patterns sat in the corner of the room. The Duke stood in front of the mirror wiping his fingers and carefully examining the person inside.He changed into Zhang Pengyi\u2019s clothes. The shirt was unbuttoned, revealing his upper body. Thin blood-red lines travelled around his waist and neck like uniform stitches.Douglas helped button his shirt.The Duke said, \u201cI thought about it. I\u2019m not going to use his face.\u201d\u201cThen what about this gentleman\u2019s wife?\u201d Douglas asked, \u201cThey seem very loving.\u201d\u201cLoving\u2026\u2026..That\u2019s good.\u201d Said the Duke. \u201cWe can give it a try later.\u201dThe Duke touched his chin: \u201cThis face should be replaced soon. It hasn\u2019t been very obedient the past few days.\u201dAs he said this, he rolled his eyes like a madman and his neck twitched a few times.It was as if\u2026..his head was struggling.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netThe butler said: \u201cUnderstood, Master.\u201d\u201cPiecing it together like this is too troublesome. If would be nice if there was a perfect guest.\u201d The Duke thought for a moment and continued: \u201cThe dinner this time was good. I saw two such guests. If one of them does not abide by my requests and makes a small mistake, that would be best.\u201d\u201cHopefully they are people who don\u2019t follow the rules.\u201d The butler answered, \u201cI will pray for you.\u201dThe Duke raised his chin and indicated to the butler to button up his shirt.He glanced at the butler and said: \u201cDouglas, your body is too old this time. When can it be changed?\u201dDouglas: \u201cAfter you and madam reunite.\u201dThe Duke\u2019s eyes softened a little: \u201cIt\u2019ll be soon. Didn\u2019t you say that this guest and his wife are very loving? My Alisa will be back soon.\u201dHe turned to Douglas again and continued: \u201cWhen you change to a young face, I want to find a painter to add a few strokes to those oil paintings and add you in too.\u201d***The night got darker. The sky was overcast again.Several thunders rolled by and the rain that had only just stopped started again.The stone railing outside dampened from the rain. Beads of water slid down leaving behind long trails.Douglas held a lamp and returned back to Zhang Pengyi\u2019s room.He said to the person behind him: \u201cGo ahead.\u201dThe Duke wearing Zhang Pengyi\u2019s formal clothes walked into the room and went straight into the bedroom.On the crimson red bed, He Jiajia was curled up under the blankets, sleeping deeply.The Duke sat down by the bed and took off the other person\u2019s mask. He examined her sleeping face.In his chest, his heart started racing faster. He closed his eyes and took in this sensation.He said to Douglas: \u201cGood\u2026\u2026..Very good. I can feel it\u2026\u2026.\u201dThere was another ring of white candles around the bed.The Duke\u2019s eyes had become a lot gentler.He gently patted He Jiajia\u2019s face and said: \u201cMy dear, wake up.\u201dThe next moment, the person who was in deep sleep actually woke up.She said mumbled in her confused state: \u201cPengyi? Why are you up?\u201dThe Duke stroked her face and looked down into her eyes: \u201cWake up. Open your eyes and look at me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u2026\u2026Just like that.\u201d\u201cKind-hearted lady, would you do me a favour?\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026..***The thunder suddenly got louder.On the third floor in a room directly above that bedroom, Zhou Qi suddenly jolted awake. Her heart pounded in her chest.She had suddenly dreamt of her boyfriend. The other person was standing before a large dressing mirror wearing formal clothes from this castle and, in his hand, he held a mask he had just taken off.With a pale face, he said to her: \u201cQiqi, I\u2019m a little cold\u2026\u2026..\u201dShe wanted to go over, but the other party moved away: \u201cDon\u2019t come here. Don\u2019t look at my eyes. Just sleep. This place is so cold\u2026\u2026\u201dShe then jolted awake.Zhao Jiatong next to her still carried the faint scent of wine. She slept soundly.Zhou Qi sat there for a while. Her body went through sudden cycles of hot and cold.She recalled her boyfriend\u2019s words from her dream before laying back down.They didn\u2019t use the bed and was sleeping on the carpet.She opened her eyes and watched the water droplets roll down the wall.It looked like someone crying\u2026\u2026..She huddled closer to Zhao Jiatong and closed her eyes again.\u2026\u2026\u20263am in the morning.A phone alarm suddenly went off in a room on the third floor closest to the east tower.After ringing, it was snoozed.Several minutes later, it started again but it was again snoozed.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.You Huo finally moved his arm away and opened his eyes.He woke up in a bad mood and looked over to the side with a frown.Qin Jiu was next to him looking down at him: \u201cIf you don\u2019t wake up, I\u2019ll have to take some drastic measures.\u201dYou Huo closed his eyes for a moment and finally sat up.In a poor mood, he asked, \u201cWhy are you waking me? I set an alarm.\u201dQin Jiu waved his phone and pointed at the screen: \u201cAre you referring to this alarm that went off eight times?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026..\u201dHe expressionlessly touched his empty trouser pockets and stared at Qin Jiu for a moment before asking: \u201cWhy is my phone in your possession?\u201d\u201cIt was too noisy. I stole it.\u201dQin Jiu bent down: \u201cSince you\u2019re awake, I\u2019ll return it to the owner.\u201dThey naturally didn\u2019t sleep with those constricting formal clothes and only wore white shirts and trousers with pockets close to their hips.You Huo watched the other person retract their hand. A corner of the phone peeked out from his pocket.\u2026\u2026\u2026After Gao Qi grabbed his coat from the bedroom and came out, he saw You Huo stand up from his seat and readjust the position of the phone in his pocket.The formal clothing here also consisted of boots. At first glance, he resembled how he looked when he was an invigilator.Gao Qi froze for a moment and said, \u201cThe boots are all the same but why do they make your legs look long and straight and mine look so bad\u2026\u2026\u201dYou Huo looked up at him.Gao Qi felt that he probably wouldn\u2019t say anything nice, so he quickly interrupted: \u201cForget it, treat it as if I hadn\u2019t said that. That\u2026\u2026.We\u2019re really going to harass the Duke now? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou can choose not to go.\u201d You Huo said.Gao Qi felt that there was a crack in this friendship.Just as he wanted to say a few more words to persuade them, someone suddenly appeared on the balcony.Zhao Jiatong said to them: \u201cDon\u2019t rush over to harass the Duke. Let\u2019s save our companion\u2019s life first.\u201dYou Huo stopped.Zhao Jiatong pointed next door: \u201cXiao Zhou is a little strange.

They could tell just by looking that her fever was very high.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Gao Qi asked.Zhao Jiatong replied: \u201cHow should I know? I\u2019m also confused. She was fine the first half of the night. Although she was a little scared, there was nothing wrong when we chatted. I have neither heard her sneeze or cough or even mention anything about being too hot or cold. She fell asleep before me and I even deliberately chose a spot away from airflow from the balcony.\u201d\u201cThen how did she become like this? When did this happen?\u201d\u201cJust now.\u201dZhao Jiatong said: \u201cShe wasn\u2019t feeling well and huddled over. I was originally sleeping quite deeply and was woken up from my nightmare by her temperature. She was like this when I opened my eyes.\u201dShe looked at Zhou Qi\u2019s unconscious state and commented worriedly: \u201cBut it\u2019s a fever and it\u2019s during an exam. I\u2019m worried about whether it was caused by the exam.\u201d\u201cWhat exam? To see who can reach the highest temperature?\u201d Gao Qi grumbled.\u201cDon\u2019t mess around. Although the system is getting more and more\u2026..\u201d Zhao Jiatong held herself back and didn\u2019t say it directly. She used actions instead to express her thoughts and continued: \u201cBut the basic rules are observed. Everyone is fine and only Xiao Zhou alone is having a fever. She must have triggered something. That\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of.\u201dQin Jiu walked around the room and checked everything: \u201cThe bed didn\u2019t move?\u201dZhao Jiatong shook her head: \u201cNo. She\u2019s more sensitive than me.\u201d\u201cAny changes to the furnishings?\u201d\u201cNone.\u201d\u201cMask, clothes?\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t taken them off.\u201d\u201cGone out alone at night?\u201dZhao Jiatong hesitated: \u201cI\u2019m not sure about this but I don\u2019t think so. Who\u2019s \u2014\u2014\u2014\u201dLike you guys?She cleared her throat and swallowed the last half of her words: \u201c\u2014\u2014She\u2019s not timid but she is definitely not brave. Even if she wants to go to the bathroom at night, she would\u2019ve woken me up.\u201d\u201cThen it can only be the dinner.\u201d Qin Jiu said.They were all the same. The only one who was different was Zhou Qi who didn\u2019t eat.Gao Qi suddenly said: \u201cCould it be like this\u2014\u2014-?\u201d\u201cThe question specified that we cannot go against any of the Dukes requests. That sickly Duke asked us to enjoy the dinner but Zhou Qi didn\u2019t touch it, so this is the so-called punishment?\u201dYou Huo immediately threw that conjecture out the window: \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cShe drank some wine. Even a drop is considered drinking.\u201d You Huo said, \u201cThe exam also mentioned that the whole group will be punished and I don\u2019t have a fever.\u201dThat\u2019s true.Gao Qi nodded: \u201cThen that\u2019s not it.\u201dUnable to find the cause, it was difficult for them to help Zhou Qi.There was clean water in the corner of the room. Zhao Jiatong soaked a towel and placed it on Zhou Qi\u2019s forehead to hopefully help cool her down a little and at least wake up.But Zhou Qi continued to remain in her unconscious state. No matter what they did she didn\u2019t show any signs of opening her eyes\u2026\u2026.She didn\u2019t even groan.As they spoke, there was suddenly a sound coming from the balcony.They all looked over.It was Yang Shu.Everyone was shocked: \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cI came from the balcony. How else?\u201d Yang Shu said this while still holding the large dress up.Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen. Please don\u2019t support those thieves, the translator KK is going to cry\u2026She untied the straps and impatiently tied the skirt up, revealing two long straight legs.\u2026\u2026\u2026Barefoot.She had probably left her heels behind in her room.The three gentlemen politely turned their heads away.But Miss Yang just said: \u201cWhat are you turning your heads for? You haven\u2019t seen people wear skirts out on the streets?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe three men couldn\u2019t refute. They quietly turned back.Gao Qi secretly exchanged looks with Zhao Jiatong. He then glanced at Zhou Qi and Yang Shu.He thought: They\u2019re all wives forcefully allocated by the system yet why is there such a big difference???Yang Shu muttered \u201cThis damned dress is really inefficient\u201d as she dug out a simple bag from her dress.Not to mention the men there, even Zhao Jiatong was surprised: \u201c\u2026\u2026..Where did you get that out from?\u201d\u201cThis dress has three layers and there\u2019s also a cage. You can try stuffing something in the second layer. I can guarantee you it won\u2019t fall out for an entire day.\u201dYang Shu would always lift her chin slightly when she spoke. It made her appear domineering and difficult to get along with.She pulled out a small box from the bag. Inside it were various neatly sorted medications.\u201cHow did you know she\u2019s sick?\u201d Zhao Jiatong was again surprised.Yang Shu: \u201cI don\u2019t. I heard you say next door that she\u2019s strange, so I came to see what\u2019s wrong.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dGao Qi said with doubt: \u201cWhere did you get the medicine?\u201dYang Shu was even more doubtful: \u201cIt\u2019s strange carrying medicine around?\u201dGao Qi shut his mouth.Yang Shu walked over to Gao Qi and unceremoniously started doing her thing.She opened Zhou Qi\u2019s eyes, pinched her mouth to force her to open it, looked at it under the lights and then pressed her finger against her neck.Her movements were very straightforward and not very gentle.You Huo took this in and asked: \u201cYou\u2019re a doctor?\u201dYang Shu: \u201cNot exactly.\u201dAlthough she said not exactly, she spread open her hand and spoke to the others without turning her head: \u201c80-90% of it is from shock. As for what caused it, I don\u2019t know. Her current situation is okay, it\u2019s stable. Her temperature is just a little high. Do you have water?\u201dZhao Jiatong passed a basin over.Yang Shu: \u201c\u2026\u2026..To drink. Not for washing rags.\u201dZhao Jiatong shook her head. She was afraid that the young lady here would say \u201cThen drink the rag water\u201d so she immediately said: \u201cIs it for the medicine? Taking it without is fine too. I learnt a trick from someone in the military so I can help her swallow.\u201dYang Shu crossed her arms and watched her with slight concern.It wasn\u2019t until Zhou Qi really swallowed the medicine that Yang Shu looked at Zhao Jiatong with an assessing look: \u201cYou\u2019re from the military?\u201d\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t look it?\u201d Zhao Jiatong smiled bitterly, \u201cI have been a bit slack the past two years.\u201dYang Shu pursed her lips but didn\u2019t comfort her.Her finger swept across the others in the room. She pointed at You Huo and assessed: \u201cYou should be from the military.\u201dShe then pointed at Qin Jiu: \u201cYou should be too.\u201dAnd she finally moved to Gao Qi: \u201cYou are definitely not.\u201dGao Qi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe middle-aged man who heard this almost vomited blood.Miss Yang calmly analysed: \u201cYou are in a bad state, but it doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that it\u2019s all just a pretence.\u201dGao Qi neither nodded nor shook his head.\u201cYou said you\u2019re not exactly a doctor. What do you mean?\u201dEveryone was also a little curious about this lady here.\u201cI study this. As for the specifics, it\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d Yang Shu said.\u201cOh\u2026\u2026.I thought you were from the military health department.\u201d Gao Qi mumbled, \u201cYoung lass here is quite good at judging people.\u201dYang Shu frowned. She clearly didn\u2019t like the term \u201cyoung lass\u201d.\u201cI have dealt with the military for some projects before.\u201d She explained briefly and then changed the subject. She clearly couldn\u2019t be bothered talking about it any further.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netZhou Qi\u2019s sickness was both sudden and the cause was unknown. It seemed inappropriate to continue with their plans of causing havoc so You Huo and Qin Jiu decided to push the plan back.Since they weren\u2019t sleepy, they didn\u2019t return to their rooms.While waiting for Zhou Qi to recover a little, they discussed the exam.Gao Qi and Zhao Jiatong conversed back and forth and tried to extract information from the Duke and head butler\u2019s words.Yang Shu didn\u2019t comment or intervene and just sat there listening.Using Gao Qi\u2019s words: She looked like a judge.As they discussed, two of them were completely uncooperative\u2014\u2014\u2013Qin Jiu said to You Huo: \u201cI have been thinking that there is something unusual in this exam.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe group punishment mentioned earlier.\u201dGao Qi\u2019s originally keen ears caught onto this and he immediately rolled his eyes. Okay! Go ahead and ponder about the rule violations, thought Gao Qi.\u201cIn previous exams, if there were punishments, it would be clearly stated. At the very least, they would tell you the punishment method.\u201dFor example, the Foreign Language exam. The system mentioned \u201centering the coffin\u201d.Another example was the previous one. The system also mentioned \u201cto replace the dead examinees\u201d.Although it wasn\u2019t explained in detail, it at least gave them information.This time it only said \u201cgroup punishment\u201d. What was the punishment? How would it be implemented? None of that was mentioned.You Huo also noticed this peculiarity.Afterall, information related to rule violations have always drawn his attention more.Qin Jiu asked: \u201cWhat do you think the system meant?\u201dYou Huo coldly ridiculed: \u201cDamned system couldn\u2019t think of anything else.\u201dGao Qi and Zhao Jiatong suddenly turned their heads and looked at him.You Huo: \u201c?\u201dGao Qi said incredulously: \u201cYou can actually swear?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHis expression gradually turned colder. Qin Jiu quietly laughed.Gao Qi quickly explained: \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m just\u2026\u2026\u2026a little surprised. I don\u2019t often hear you speak like that.\u201dIn his memory, this young friend of his was cold, indifferent and not very talkative but he was also very good at sarcasm. Whenever this Big Invigilator was angry, every word of his were like icy cold needles. Although the amount was small, it was very painful. That was something everyone knew.But as a friend, Gao Qi could sense from various aspects of life that Invigilator A was holding back.In fact, most invigilators are holding back. If anyone were to live all year round in a place where you\u2019re constantly being monitored, one would naturally hide their \u201ctrue selves\u201d and restrain themselves so that they could meet the system\u2019s standards as best they could.At the very least, that was what it seemed like on the surface.But Invigilator A was different.Someone once joked in private that the reason why Invigilator A was ranked A was not only because he was strong, it was also because he was very similar to the system itself.He was able to adapt to the systems changes faster than any of the other invigilators, and he was cold and unsympathetic. All the emotions a normal young man would experience was very rarely seen on him.He would get impatient, unhappy, be picky or be disgusted.But more intense emotions like irritation, anger, excitement, sorrow or even cursing out\u2026\u2026..It didn\u2019t exist.It was only when he was confronted by the other faction that he would occasionally show a bit more life.Gao Qi had grown used to it in the past, so he took it for granted.But now he suddenly remembered\u2026\u2026\u2026.Invigilator A back then was just a twenty-something year old young man.If he wasn\u2019t under the systems constraints, he should be like a normal young man filled with vitality and emotions. Although he might be a little arrogant because of his good looks but when he\u2019s happy he would smile, when he\u2019s angry he would curse and he would also have people he hates, and people he loves.He wouldn\u2019t have become a cold, emotionless representative of a machine.He would have had the life of a normal person.When they were in the carriage before, Gao Qi felt that You Huo\u2019s behaviour was still the same as the past and not much had changed. He thought the influence and effect by the system was probably too strong, too deeply etched into him. Even after losing his memories, Invigilator A was still unable to revert back.It was only now, when he saw You Huo talk to Qin Jiu, that Gao Qi finally saw on this old friend of his\u2026\u2026..A trace of vitality that he should see in a young person.He wasn\u2019t used to it, but he was very happy.Very, very happy.\u2026\u2026\u2026He even started to find Qin Jiu a little more pleasing to the eye.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Mother Gao Qi worrying about his good friendPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They muttered: \u201cMaybe we thought too much. It was just a normal fever.\u201dYou Huo however didn\u2019t so.He asked Qin Jiu the time and then looked at the sky outside.Gao Qi had been an invigilator for many years, so he was a little unfamiliar with exams. Intuitively, he wasn\u2019t as sensitive as the regular examinees. He asked curiously: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is there something?\u201dJust as You Huo was about to speak up, Qin Jiu answered: \u201cJust thought the time is a little too coincidental.\u201dYou Huo closed his mouth again: \u201cMhn.\u201d\u201cWhat coincidence?\u201d Gao Qi asked again.\u201cThe time Miss Zhou\u2019s fever receded.\u201d Qin Jiu said.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think that Miss Zhou\u2019s fever receded just at the right moment?\u201d Qin Jiu pointed out the balcony: \u201cIt\u2019s dawn. All the restrictions at night have been lifted and her fever has receded.\u201dIt was as if\u2026\u2026..Her fever was there to ensure that she stays quietly in her room without going anywhere.Gao Qi laughed: \u201cThat can\u2019t be. What type of exam would be so nice? And to even have this ability? How is that possible?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a little strange.\u201d Qin Jiu pointed at You Huo and said: \u201cThat\u2019s why Mr. Invigilator is checking.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dEverything he wanted to say was already spoken. It saved him the effort of opening his mouth.He stood behind the door listening to the sounds outside and glanced at Qin Jiu: \u201cAre you surnamed Hui?\u201d (KKnotes: Here he refers to roundworms (Hui Chong\u86d4\u866b). Basically, he\u2019s commenting on Qin Jiu\u2019s ability to read his mind.)Qin Jiu said: \u201cI can occasionally activate this ability.\u201dHe sauntered over to the door and stood behind You Huo. With his hand already grasping the door handle, he suddenly added another sentence: \u201cBut there are some prerequisites.\u201dYou Huo looked at him for a moment: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026For example?\u201d\u201cFor example\u2026\u2026\u2026It depends on whom?\u201dQin Jiu said this and opened the door slightly.Outside, all the servants who had disappeared during the night had suddenly returned. They stood next to the doors like guards, one on each side.They were expressionless and stiff, as if they had been standing there all night.The morning sun rays filtered through several of the windows. It was as if nothing had happened overnight.A servant heard the door open and turned his head. His eyes met with Qin Jiu\u2019s.Qin Jiu calmly greeted him: \u201cGood morning.\u201dThe male servant: \u201cGood morning.\u201dThe door then slammed shut.Two seconds later, the male servant suddenly turned his head and stared at the door: \u201c?????\u201dAnother voice asked hoarsely, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cThe gentleman who stays in this room\u2026\u2026.looks like that???\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem so.\u201dOn the other side of the door, Qin Jiu who had one hand pressed on the door smiled at You Huo: \u201cRun.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe next second, Gao Qi saw two figures flash past. They reached the balcony in an instant and jumped over, disappearing one after another.When they passed him, they even pushed him to urge him to go over to the door.The male servant ignored common etiquettes and directly opened the door. As soon as it opened, he saw Gao Qi leaning next to it.Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen. Please don\u2019t support those thieves, the translator KK is going to cry\u2026The two looked at each other.The servant asked: \u201cYou opened the door just now?\u201dGao Qi: \u201cOf course.\u201dServant: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dAlthough the mask only revealed the lower half of the face\u2026\u2026\u2026He went to the room next to the room next door in disbelief. As soon as the door opened, he saw Qin Jiu come out of the bedroom with his coat. He casually revealed a slight look of surprise: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dYang Shu was sitting on the carpet in her large dress organising her bag. She turned to the male servant and reproached: \u201cWho taught you to enter a lady\u2019s room without knocking? Get out.\u201dServant: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe closed the door and stood outside in silence for a few seconds. Was I blind??***Although Zhou Qi\u2019s fever had receded, her overall condition wasn\u2019t very good.As Yang Shu said, it was probably from shock. She also didn\u2019t eat breakfast today.With her like this, You Huo who was in the same group had one more thing to worry about.As such, he and Qin Jiu for once decided to hold back a little. In other words, they changed their plan and decided to follow Zhao Jiatong\u2019s suggestion to follow the plot and go to town.At 8 o\u2019clock in the morning, black carriages were stopped outside the old castle. It waited there silently.The guests boarded the carriages one after another before the carriages turned a corner around Carlton Mountain and disappeared in the distance.In the west tower, the Duke stood behind the window looking out past the curtain.\u201cMaster.\u201d The butler Douglas stood behind him and asked respectfully, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dThe Duke replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Suddenly wanted to take a look at the guests. I wonder how many will come back safely.\u201dAfter he finished saying that, he pursed his lips and the corners of his lips fell. He appeared to be in a very bad mood.The entire room was filled with dangerous oppressiveness. Rotten atmosphere carrying the scent of death permeated through the silence.Douglas didn\u2019t speak.A moment later, the Duke suddenly spoke: \u201cThis time it was unsuccessful.\u201dHe turned and asked the butler: \u201cWhy\u2026\u2026.is this?\u201dHe touched his chest. This place had already been replaced. Zhang Pengyi\u2019s heart was beating inside, slowly integrating with him.\u201cI can feel that he loves that woman.\u201d The Duke lowered his head and said this: \u201cJust like how I love my Alyssa. Although that woman\u2019s face is far inferior to Alyssa\u2019s\u2026\u2026.Someone as gentle as Alyssa wouldn\u2019t blame her. So why is it? Why didn\u2019t Alyssa return to me, Douglas?\u201dThe butler stood with his hands overlapped respectfully and said with his frail voice: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps the lady doesn\u2019t love this gentleman enough.\u201dThe Duke\u2019s mood finally improved a little.He thought about it: \u201cThat\u2019s true. That\u2019s probably it.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m still not happy.\u201d The Duke said softly, \u201cI tried too many times and waited too long. My patience is almost gone.\u201dButler: \u201cThere will be a day.\u201dDuke: \u201cThat\u2019s right, have you dealt with these kind-hearted guests?\u201dHe said softly: \u201cAlthough my Alyssa didn\u2019t come back, they helped me a little and made a small contribution after all. We can\u2019t have them exhibited out here.\u201dThe butler lowered his eyes and bowed his head: \u201cIt\u2019s done. As directed, I let them rest just like the others.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. That\u2019s good\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d The Duke added: \u201cIt won\u2019t bring me any trouble, right?\u201dThe butler\u2019s frail voice said: \u201cIt won\u2019t, Master.\u201dThe Duke patted his shoulder: \u201cI feel reassured with you dealing it it\u2026\u2026..How old were you when you came here?\u201d\u201cFour years old, Master. You saved my life and I have always been here since.\u201dDuke: \u201cIn this world, aside from Alyssa, you treat me the best.\u201d\u201cAs I should, Master.\u201d\u201cYou will never betray me?\u201d The Duke stared into his eyes.\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYou will always listen to me?\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201d\u201cThen hurry and change into a young body. I think that guest\u2026\u2026that guest is good.\u201dThe Duke thought it over: \u201cThe body of those two guests are too perfect. Their height, their muscles, the lines, their strength\u2026\u2026.You take one and I take one, we\u2019ll divide it?\u201dDouglas hesitated for a moment before nodding: \u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, the guests are very shy and timid. I observed those two during breakfast for a long time and I think they\u2019re too gentlemanly. Can you think of ways to make the two perfect gentlemen make a mistake? The kind that would make me unhappy. That way I can have a reason to give them a small punishment.\u201dDouglas thought for a while and said: \u201cI will try.\u201dThe violent head butler pondered over this for a moment and decided to follow the guests to town \u2014\u2013 There, he would have a whole day to lure the guests into making a mistake.Please read this from kk translatesThere was no need for a big mistake.They had seen plenty of visiting guests. These cowards wouldn\u2019t dare do anything too outrageous.A small mistake would be enough to make them tremble.***The weather in the middle of summer was sultry and humid. The town was as usual very lifeless.It wasn\u2019t until a large number of horse-drawn carriages stopped in town and circled the fountain that several townspeople looked out from their doors and windows.\u201cAre you here to treat us?\u201d They asked.One of the examinees answered: \u201cYes, that\u2019s right!\u201dNot far away, the door to a small church opened. A nun in a black habit ran over to the carriages: \u201cYou\u2019re finally here. Come with me.\u201dThe examinees glanced at each other before following after the nun.The nun reached out and counted: \u201cA total of 24?\u201dMany subconsciously nodded.After a while, someone suddenly whispered: \u201cThat\u2019s not right. Weren\u2019t there 26 examinees?\u201dFor a moment, everyone was silent. Then it was the sound of discussions.\u201cZhang Pengyi and his girlfriend\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s the two who were late last night. Where are they? They didn\u2019t come?\u201d\u201cMaybe\u2026\u2026Maybe they overslept? Or they gave up getting points from the town?\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026Many of them had a terrifying thought but no one wanted that thought to come true, so they only tried to make more positive guesses.After a moment, they fell silent again.\u201cWhich room did those two examinees stay in?\u201d You Huo asked suddenly.Zhao Jiatong: \u201cI didn\u2019t pay attention. Seems to be downstairs?\u201d\u201cDirectly below your room.\u201d Qin Jiu said.\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Zhao Jiatong asked with surprise.\u201cPaid a bit more attention last night.\u201dYou Huo looked at Qin Jiu. He hadn\u2019t said anything yet.Qin Jiu nodded: \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll take a look tonight.\u201dZhao Jiatong: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Am I deaf?***The church was dark and gloomy.As soon as they entered, everyone couldn\u2019t help but hold their breaths.The smell was terrible.The smell of sweat, rotting flesh and blood were mixed together. It made breathing extremely difficult.The church\u2019s pews had been removed and replaced with numerous worn-out beds. Roughly counting, there were about twenty or so of them. On every one of the beds was a curled up mass\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cOh my god\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that a human???\u201dExclamations and gasps sounded one after another.Those with weaker tolerances started to gag.The nun lowered her eyes: \u201cThese are the sick. They have been sick for a long time. The Duke has been very kind and would always invite some guests here to help. It is said that they are all very skilled in medicine, just like you.\u201dGao Qi muttered: \u201cThat\u2019s just pure lies\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dYou Huo looked over at a bed nearby.He saw sores of various sizes on that person\u2019s face, and one side of his jaw was bloody.He hid inside the discoloured bedsheets clawing at his face in agony. The top of his fingers was completely stained red.The nun sighed: \u201cUnfortunately there aren\u2019t many doctors who can really help these sick ones. Some doctors weren\u2019t able to help treat this disease and was conversely infected.\u201dAs she said this, she led the examinees over to their positions.After she was done, they realised that there was a total of 26 beds. If Zhang Pengyi and his girlfriend was here, the number of sick corresponded exactly to the number of examinees.It could be deduced from this that helping the sick was probably the way to score their first point.Of course, it could also be a death question.The nun walked over to the last bed and gently let out an \u201cah\u201d.There was only a filthy sheet on the bed. No one was there.\u201cHaa, twisted thoughts again.\u201d The nun\u2019s mutterings entered You Huo\u2019s ear.She hurried to the door and said to everyone: \u201cA disobedient one slipped away. I have to go find him. As for the remaining ones here, I\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d\u201cBy the way, just a quick reminder. They have been sick for a long time, so their tempers are a little bad. Please\u2026\u2026.be careful. Also, don\u2019t touch their sores. Once you touch it, you can be infected.\u201dShe pulled open the door and turned her head back: \u201cGetting infected is a very terrible thing. You can die from it.\u201d\u201cI wish you good luck.\u201dWhen she was done, she closed the door.The sound of the door handle clanging could be heard from outside.The moment the sound was heard, a hand suddenly reached over and grabbed You Huo\u2019s arm. It carried a smelly and sticky sensation.You Huo looked down. The patient he was in charge of, with bloody sores all over his hands, was grabbing his arm\u2026\u2026\u2026..And he even had the nerve to look at him and cry.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: No need to try and make them make a mistake.

It was the one he had used when he was sleepwalking. He intuitively felt that the town wasn\u2019t safe and stored it there just in case. He didn\u2019t expect it to come in handy so quickly.Gao Qi had always strongly favoured his friends. If anyone dared to touch his brothers, he would cut their hands off.It wasn\u2019t a joke.Unexpectedly, just as the tip of his knife was about to pierce through, another person was a step ahead.A slender and powerful hand grabbed the \u201cpatient\u2019s\u201d arm that was covered with bloody sores and rotting flesh and twisted it in the opposite direction.There was a crack.That rotting hand twitched and fell to the ground before rolling around a few times.\u2026\u2026\u2026.Everyone was shocked. This included Gao Qi who was still holding his knife.He dumbfoundedly looked at the ruthless man.Who else could it be apart from Qin Jiu?!With his lips pursed, he casually flicked off the blood on his hand and turned to Yang Shu: \u201cI remember you brought tissues?\u201dThe domineering Miss Yang was also shocked by his actions. She mechanically pulled out her bag from her dress and handed him the tissues.And Qin Jiu even gentlemanly said: \u201cThank you.\u201dGao Qi: \u201c???\u201d\u201cWhy did you grab him?\u201d Miss Yang finally couldn\u2019t hold back and asked the question Gao Qi wanted to ask.Qin Jiu didn\u2019t even look up. He pulled out two sheets of tissues and said: \u201cThe Black Death won\u2019t last this long. You also said earlier that with the severity of the disease, it wouldn\u2019t be an issue even if they lose a limb. Or did you actually plan to treat them and give them medicine?\u201dYang Shi internally commented: Who discussed the matter of treating or not treating?? Was this the main issue here???But before she was able to say anything, a scream rang out.The patient who lost his arm reacted belatedly and instantly started to howl.With this howl of his, all the other \u201cpatients\u201d in the room started to howl too.The examinees were startled by this and subconsciously covered their ears.The next moment, the patients curled up in their sheets rushed out. Their bloody hands grabbed at the examinees standing before their beds.In an instant, screams and shouts filled the entire church.Qin Jiu felt an arm hook around his neck. The hand was clenched into a fist to avoid it touching his face.He was then dragged over past a square pillar and his back was pressed against it.You Huo removed his arm from Qin Jiu\u2019s neck and frowned: \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d\u201cYou mean this?\u201d Qin Jiu raised his blood-stained hand, \u201cI have always been crazy, didn\u2019t you know that?\u201dThe church\u2019s stained-glass windows sat very high up on the walls. The gloomy light from outside passed through the stained glass, leaving only several rays.Only one of Qin Jiu\u2019s eyes was illuminated under that light. He jokingly blocked You Huo\u2019s line of sight and said: \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. According to the nun\u2019s words, you have been infected. Are you scared?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cNot scared.\u201dA disease from the exam. It obviously wasn\u2019t going to be anything normal.But he had even entered the coffin before so why would he be afraid of this so-called \u201cinfectious disease\u201d?\u201cThat\u2019s no good.\u201dPlease read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen. Please don\u2019t support those thieves, the translator KK is going to cry\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s very lonely being alone when you\u2019re sick, Big Invigilator.\u201d Qin Jiu shook the tissue apart and handed one over: \u201cI\u2019ll keep you company.\u201dYou Huo suddenly felt like his heart was gently scratched.***The inside of the church was chaotic and messy.On one hand, the examinees were scared. On the other hand, they also had other concerns\u2014\u2014-If they fought, they feared that they would touch the sores and also start rotting.If they didn\u2019t fight, then for how long will they need to run?Gao Qi and Zhao Jiatong are very capable.But fighting with your bare fists was already difficult against four pairs of hands let alone the fact that there are more than forty hands that are comparable to that of biohazard weapons.They pressed down four of the \u201cpatients\u201d onto the beds and then tied another two up with the sheets.Yang Shu wasn\u2019t from the military so she definitely couldn\u2019t fight.However, neither she nor Zhou Qi dragged them down. The two girls were first-rate in agility and flexibility. As they dodged, they even used their heels to clobber one of them.But they didn\u2019t have the upper hand.These patients weren\u2019t afraid of dying but they still wanted to live.\u201cFuck! The knife is too short!\u201dTwo black and bloody heads flew over. Gao Qi cursed and pushed Zhao Jiantong behind him.He subconsciously closed his eyes and internally shouted: This is just a fucking infection! Come one! I dare you to infect my face directly!As soon as they\u2019re about an inch away from him, he heard a thud.The blood and flesh he expected didn\u2019t spatter onto his face and he instead heard the sound of something heavy falling.Gao Qi opened his eyes.He saw that the two \u201calready infected\u201d great masters had jumped in. They jumped across the bed and joined the chaos.The so-called strong feared those who weren\u2019t afraid of dying.As for those who weren\u2019t afraid of dying\u2026\u2026\u2026.They feared the strong who weren\u2019t afraid of dying.You Huo and Qin Jiu carried a \u201cwhat\u2019s done is done\u201d attitude and didn\u2019t hold back.Those patients were fighting while riddled with sores so they naturally couldn\u2019t match with those two.And so, it only took 15 minutes in total from beginning to end for the dark little church to \u201cchange completely\u201d.Beds were lying crooked everywhere and the so-called \u201cpatients\u201d were all bound by the bedsheets such that only their rotting heads were revealed.25 of them were lined up along the ground. At first glance, they looked like a group of bowling pins.You Huo held a metal stool and coldly stood in front of one of them to impose onto him a silent threat.Patient: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe moved his eyes and looked up. It met with the eyes of another great devil.Qin Jiu stood behind him. With his hand touching his shoulder that was covered by the bedsheet, he bent down and asked: \u201cThat nun left in too much of a hurry and spoke too generally so we\u2019re finding it hard understanding. Can you explain to us what this disease is?\u201dPatient: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe felt that if he said the wrong thing, the stool before him would be thrown over and the person behind him would directly twist his head off.The examinees watching on the side were already speechless.On one hand, they felt extremely exhilarated. On the other hand, they were also a little shocked\u2026.Gao Qi looked at Zhao Jiatong with a complicated expression: \u201cHey, those two\u2026\u2026uh, it makes this amiable middle-aged man feel complicated.\u201dZhao Jiatong: \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cNo matter how you look at it, we look more like the villains, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Gao Qi clenched his fist and quietly whispered a slogan: \u201cJustice will always prevail over evil\u2014\u2013We\u2019re the evil ones.\u201dZhao Jiatong: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dIt really does look like it\u2026\u2026\u2026Zhao Jiatong: \u201cDo you want them to change their way of questioning?\u201dGao Qi: \u201cThat won\u2019t do. I\u2019ll just keep quiet.\u201dTo be smashed to death or to have his head twisted off?This was a death question.Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen. Please don\u2019t support those thieves, the translator KK is going to cry\u2026That patient groaned and said hoarsely: \u201cIt\u2019s not the Black Death\u2026\u2026..\u201dYang Shu rolled her eyes with her arms crossed: \u201cWe know that.\u201d\u201cThis town used to have Black Death, but it had already passed. Those who had to die had already died and they\u2019ve all been cremated. When winter came and snow fell, the disease was gone. The number of deceased here in the town cannot compare with the deceased in Carlton Manor\u2026\u2026\u201d The patient said slowly.His eyes were very large. If it rotated around a little more, it looked like it could fall out.There were also several moments when the right and left eyes were looking in different directions.Yang Shu who stood on the side frowned. She turned and looked up at the lights inside the church and walked away quietly with bare feet.The patient continued: \u201cSpeaking of the Black Death, the Duke also had it.\u201dThe patient next to him hoarsely added: \u201cNot just him. The Duke, his wife, his child, the butler, and their servants\u2026\u2026.All of them.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The Black Death spread very quickly. Those doctors wore masks and black robes and had themselves completely covered up, but it still got to them. Who could avoid it in the castle?\u201dThose patients looked like dead people. The words they spoke were also very haunting.Many of the examinees who heard this felt goosebumps form along their arms, but no one interrupted.\u201cLater, after who knows how long, news came from the castle\u2019s end. They said that the Duke managed to find a witchdoctor and was soon about to recover. Perhaps it was because they wanted to do good deeds, they sent food over to every household.\u201d The patient said.\u201cYes, I remember\u2026\u2026They said they were afraid of infection, so they didn\u2019t invite us to the castle. Instead we received fresh beef, mutton and large barrels of wine. After the Black Death, it was the first time we ate so well. That day I ate too much and vomited twice before starting to have a fever\u2026\u201dHearing this, You Huo asked: \u201cThere\u2019s a problem with the food?\u201dThat patient shook his head: \u201cNo. Only I was sick for a few days. The others were fine.\u201dThe other patients agreed.\u201cMy fever came and receded, came and receded. After a few days, perhaps because my body couldn\u2019t handle it anymore, I got blood ulcers both large and small. Afterwards\u2026..I\u2026\u2026.\u201dThat patient tilted his head in thought for a while and said: \u201cI forgot\u2026\u2026I seem to have always been staying in this church.\u201dUnable to be cured, he had always been here in the church.The people around him gradually increased. Like him, they were similarly covered in sores and bloody flesh wounds.\u201cFrom time to time, waves of doctors would come \u2013 just like you guys. But we don\u2019t remember the specifics\u2026..Maybe some were burnt? And maybe some were infected?\u201dOne examinee finally couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cAre you\u2026\u2026.still alive?\u201dThe patient was blank for a moment: \u201cI forgot.\u201dIt had been too long. This kind of torture had lasted too long.They had already forgotten whether they were still alive\u2026\u2026.Yang Shu\u2019s voice suddenly travelled over: \u201cYou guys come here.\u201dYou Huo straightened up and looked over. At some unknown point in time, Yang Shu had moved to a corner of the church.Above her was the church\u2019s stained-glass window.You Huo tiled his head over and said to Qin Jiu: \u201cGo and take a look.\u201dThe two finally moved away from the patient and walked over to Yang Shu one after another. The other examinees also gathered around.Looking at it closely, they finally realised that the picture depicted in the stained-glass window wasn\u2019t the ones you normally see in churches. Instead, it was of a person wearing a hood and a mask surrounded by a circle of candles.The light from outside shone in from those candles. Looking over from their position, those patients bound in sheets were no longer human. There weren\u2019t any blood or flesh on their faces. It was only white skulls.Those skulls looked blankly over at the group through their dark holey eyes.Gao Qi cursed: \u201cI knew the history question was just a guise. What kind of history has something like this?\u201dThe Black Death was fake. Sorcery was real.An examinee trembled while asking seriously: \u201cIt might be because I read too many short stories, but this looks like a curse.\u201dAnother examinee asked: \u201cWhen the sun shines, they look like skeletons\u2026\u2026How can this disease be treated? Kill them all?\u201dYou Huo thought about it and turned to Qin Jiu: \u201cI\u2019m going to tie up the nun. You coming?\u201dQin Jiu laughed: \u201cHow can you do naughty things without me?\u201dOther examinees: \u201c???\u201dGao Qi: \u201cI\u2019ll go too.\u201dQin Jiu asked: \u201cHave you been infected?\u201dGao Qi: \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, I have.\u201d Qin Jiu smiled and patted his shoulder: \u201cJust stay here obediently.\u201dGao Qi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dIs being infected something you should be so pleased about???Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net<Chatper 83>ClickNovel has something to say: \u201cIt\u2019s very lonely being alone when you\u2019re sick, Big Invigilator.\u201d Qin Jiu shook the tissue apart and handed one over: \u201cI\u2019ll keep you company.\u201dAHHHHH \u2764\u2764Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I mean, didn\u2019t the nun mention it? There were doctors before who were able to treat the patients. Although there weren\u2019t many, it wasn\u2019t none.\u201dAfter You Huo and Qin Jiu left, the other examinees didn\u2019t remain idle.They tried to get more information from the patients or find clues hidden in the church.Gao Qi and Zhao Jiatong became the leaders of this group.\u201cThese patients have already become like this. I don\u2019t think the so-called treatment is what it means in a literal sense.\u201d Gao Qi looked carefully at the carvings at the base of the stone pillar and said: \u201cSearch everywhere. If you find anything share it with everyone.\u201dZhao Jiatong added: \u201cFirst, find things related to the patients. Afterall, they are the key to the current problem. Although they themselves are already\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dShe wanted to say \u201cneither a human nor a ghost\u201d but because she felt a little bad for them, she changed her words: \u201cthey no longer remember, there should be traces left behind. It might possibly be a clue.\u201d\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d\u201cCome on, let\u2019s split up and search.\u201dThe examinees voiced their agreements and scattered across the church.What surprised Gao Qi and Zhao Jiatong was that some examinees they were unfamiliar with came over and asked: \u201cWhat about those two? Are you really going to let them go out like this? Won\u2019t something happen?\u201dHumans are always like this. In a dangerous setting, they are more inclined to hide out where it\u2019s safer. With the church figured out, it was much safer than the town outside.From what they could see, although those two are very powerful, it was still dangerous going outside.Gao Qi internally thought: With the first-generation invigilator leader and the second-generation invigilator leader working together, what could they be afraid of?But he still remained humble and reassured: \u201cThose two are fine. They know what to do. If they encounter any problems, they will come back for help.\u201dAfter the examinees left, Zhao Jiatong suddenly sighed.Gao Qi: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cJust felt it\u2019s quite unexpected?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s unexpected?\u201d\u201cThe exams over the past two years have become more and more tricky, and more and more unreasonable.\u201d Zhao Jiatong said: \u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s clearly just trying to trap people in here. This kind of environment generally makes examinees develop in a negative direction. I thought they would be more cold, indifferent\u2026\u2026..and more animalistic.\u201dSelfishness was very natural.In order to live, some would hold malicious intentions.She didn\u2019t expect that the examinees she encountered would be willing to work together, share information and even worry about a companion they had met for the first time.Gao Qi thought about it: \u201cIt might be because we haven\u2019t reached that stage yet. At least in this exam we haven\u2019t reached that point yet.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dGao Qi touched the stone pillar and said after a while: \u201cWith you saying that, I suddenly understand why A has been always acting out.\u201dZhao Jiatong stopped: \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI just feel that although he is very proud, his personality isn\u2019t one that would want to attract attention. It might be because he may have some madness hidden inside but it shouldn\u2019t be to this extent.\u201dZhao Jiatong nodded: \u201cYeah, to be honest, I was quite surprised too. I almost thought it was because of 001\u2019s influence.\u201dPlease read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen. Please don\u2019t support those thieves, the translator KK is going to cry\u2026Gao Qi: \u201cMaybe he\u2019s doing this to make the exam seem less intimidating? Almost to the point that it\u2019s childish; like a joke? To let the other examinees realise that it\u2019s still far from the need to give up on humanity and kill one another.\u201dZhao Jiatong mulled over this thoughtfully.Gao Qi stopped for a moment and then said with a complicated expression: \u201cSo when 001 was a defiant examinee, he was probably also thinking this?\u201dIf that was the case, he could understand why the two of them are able to get along so well.Suddenly, Zhou Qi\u2019s voice travelled over: \u201cBrother Qi, Sister Tong, please take a look.\u201dThey looked over.She and Yang Shu were squatting beside a bed that had fallen onto its side.Yang Shu pointed under the bed: \u201cBlood writing.\u201dEveryone heard this and gathered. Under the bed was crooked writing written in blood.One could imagine that at some point in time a patient had hidden under the bed and, while their consciousness was still clear, written with their bloody, mutilated fingers\u2014\u2014The nun and Duke are devils, madmen! They\u2019re causing harm\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026***The back door of the church led out to an overgrown garden. On both sides was a promenade and once you pass through that there was a small hut with a pointed roof.You Huo and Qin Jiu looked around as they walked through but found no trace of the nun or patient no. 26. The door of the small hut with the pointed room however was slightly ajar.The two looked at each other and quietly entered the room sideways.The hut looked like it probably had not been used in a long time. Thick dust was gathered everywhere.The mirror, candles, tables and chairs were all covered in spider webs. There was a musty smell in the air.Qin Jiu swept away the dust in front of him and looked around the room while covering his nose.You Huo had a look of disgust. He coughed a few times.He used the tip of his finger to pull open drawers and open boxes. After rummaging around, an old book caught his attention.The books in the room were either placed on the bookshelves or stored in wooden boxes. Only that book sat on the hearth of the fireplace. From its uneven corners, it was clear that it had been ripped.He opened the book and read a few pages.\u201cWhat did you find?\u201d Qin Jiu came over and asked in a low voice.\u201cA witchdoctor\u2019s book.\u201d You Huo pointed at the faded name at the bottom of the title page: \u201cThe priests\u2019. Stained with blood and missing pages.\u201dCoincidentally, the missing pages appeared to be witchcraft about resurrection.The book mentioned that it is a very dangerous witchcraft. For resurrection, there was a horrible price that needed to be paid.The contents came to an abrupt end after this. The dozen or so pages after that had been destroyed. There were both tearing and burn marks.This made it all the more clear\u2014\u2013Ever since they came here, they had not seen the priest around. He was probably dead or among the 26 patients.\u2026\u2026..Perhaps he was the one that went missing.The only person in charge here was the nun but there were no signs of her living here in the church.She either lived somewhere else in the town, or she wasn\u2019t a normal person.Suddenly, wailing broke the silence in the hut.The voice was muffled and dull\u2026\u2026.Qin Jiu listened to it for a moment and pointed at the floor. He whispered: \u201cDown here.\u201dThat voice came from somewhere underground. It was probably a basement.They found a trapdoor under the desk. In order for it not to get in the way, they took off their formal coat and left it next to the bed \u2014\u2014 The only place that had no spiderwebs.Although silk shirts and tall boots weren\u2019t appropriate for fighting, it wasn\u2019t something that would hinder them too much.Under the trapdoor was a long set of stone steps. It was both dark and wet.At the end of those steps was a narrow tunnel.Wind from who knows where caused the fire on the stone walls to shake.They could vaguely hear a woman\u2019s hoarse whisper as they walked through the narrow tunnel. Sometimes it was close, sometimes it was far. It gave it a very haunted feeling.The tunnel was filled with bones.Rumour has it that there are such tunnels under some old European castles where the bodies of the dead were piled up.You Huo frowned. He gestured something to Qin Jiu and went deeper in as he followed the voice.Deep inside, there were several rooms. Iron fences surrounded each of them. It was probably an underground dungeon.The first room was covered with mouldy grass. Several animals laid paralysed on the grass. Their chests rose and fell so they were still alive but they were also not far from dying.You Huo looked around and mouthed to Qin Jiu: \u201cTwo pigs, four goats, and a snake.\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesQin Jiu: \u201cKeeping pets underground. That\u2019s a pretty unique interest.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026.The taste is more unique.\u201dHe held his breath with a taunt expression.The nuns voice was just ahead. It travelled past the rough underground dungeon stone wall.She lowered her voice and said hoarsely: \u201cJust five left. Just five sacrifices left. Why are you always trying to escape?\u201dThe other voice was sobbing. It trembled as it sobbed.\u201cLook. The other patients are being good. Only you\u2019re like this. Do you know what you are like right now?\u201d The nun said quietly.The sobbing stopped. It spoke while trembling: \u201cKnow\u2026..I know. It was written in the book. I remember it. Using this witchcraft requires you to pay a huge price. You all passed that onto us\u2026\u2026.I probably, I probably\u2026\u2026\u2026no longer look like a human.\u201d\u201cYou actually remember that. I\u2019m a little surprised.\u201d The nun giggled: \u201cBut it\u2019s not that you no longer look like a human. You can\u2019t be called a human anymore. Do you know what you look like when the sun outside hits you? When it\u2019s on your hand, your hands are bones. When it\u2019s on your face, your face is all bone. If you go outside and stand under the sun, imagine how many townspeople will be scared?\u201d\u201cThis should\u2019ve been yours.\u201d That voice whimpered, \u201cYou and that Dukes. You two deserve this curse.\u201dThe nun said: \u201cYeah, it\u2019s all thanks to kind-hearted people like you that we can avoid this kind of pain. How about this\u2026\u2026.\u201dThere was a sound of rustling. It sounded like a large dress moving across the stone ground.\u201cI\u2019ll set you free in advance so that you won\u2019t run around anymore. Your mental power is unexpectedly strong, it\u2019s surprising. Not bad\u2026\u2026that\u2019s not bad. Why haven\u2019t I noticed this before?\u201d The nun said: \u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019ve grown tired of using this woman\u2019s identity. I want to change back into a man.\u201d\u201cNo. Don\u2019t light the candles\u2026\u2026..Please, don\u2019t light them.\u201d The wailing person begged incoherently: \u201cYou can\u2019t. I\u2019m already rotten. Rotten. No flesh or blood left. It\u2019s useless to change.\u201dThe nun said: \u201cLooks like you didn\u2019t read the book you stole carefully enough. It\u2019s the curse that\u2019s making you look like a skeleton under the sun. I\u2019ll find a body for you, so you won\u2019t have to rot so badly. How good is that? You lend me your body; I\u2019ll transfer the curse to the nun, and she can return to the sickbed in your place. How does that sound?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u2026..no! You\u2019ll cut me. Cut me to pieces. I saw the Duke do this!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t. I promise.\u201d The nun persuaded. It even sounded a little tempting: \u201cThe Duke just used the wrong method at the beginning causing him to change his body piece by piece. But that\u2019s also because he\u2019s too picky. When he finds a body that both perfect and strong, I think\u2026\u2026.he probably won\u2019t make it so ugly anymore.\u201dThat missing \u201cpatient\u201d was still crying. He repeatedly begged \u201cNo, please\u201d, but the nun ignored him.You Huo and Qin Jiu sneaked over. They quietly leaned against the wall and glanced in.In the dungeon, the nun with her hair scattered was laying candles in a circle around a bloodied man.The flames on the candles suddenly leapt and turned crimson red. It was strange and terrifying.The nun\u2019s finger stroked the top of the bloodied man\u2019s head. She then bent down, closed her eyes and whispered a few words.The moment the candle flames began to tremble wildly, You Huo bend his finger at Qin Jiu and made a gesture.Kidnap?Together.***While the two gentlemen are sweeping through the dungeon without a care in the world, a tall, thin figure slipped through the church door and entered the dusty small hut.It was none other than Douglas, the Duke\u2019s head butler.With his old, wrinkled face, he lightly coughed a few times before his eyes fell onto the coats next to the bed.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026got them\u201d Douglas whispered: \u201cNot wearing their formal clothes. This is a small mistake that will make the Master unhappy.\u201dBut it seems that the two gentlemen had strayed into the dungeon.If the witchdoctor had taken them first, that would be a pity\u2026..Haa, pitiful people.Douglas muttered this internally.He found the trapdoor with familiarity and followed the stone steps down into the dungeon hoping to get the two gentlemen back before the witchdoctor could do anything.Douglass heard some noises as he walked through the tunnel. He subconsciously quickened his pace.He thought he would see something like this: The two gentlemen tied up and, on their knees, trembling pitifully and begging for mercy. The witchdoctor who wore the nun\u2019s skin would stand among the candles with his hand on their heads laughing while waiting for the other party to give up their body.It wasn\u2019t until he reached the iron fence and took the scene in that he almost couldn\u2019t breathe.The candles were there.The people were all there too.But the position was reversed\u2026..The one kneeling in the circle was the witchdoctor and the ones holding him down were the two gentlemen.In the corner nearby was a bloodied patient. It was the priest.And next to the witchdoctor in the ring of candles, laid a pig.Of the two gentlemen, one held the witchdoctor down with one knee and the other held the witchdoctor\u2019s hand and pressed it on the pig\u2019s head.The witchdoctor was about to go crazy.Douglas was also about to go crazy.What was frightening was that the moment those two gentlemen heard sounds from his end, they both looked over.One of them tilted his head and smiled: \u201cWhat a coincidence, another one is here.\u201dThe other said: \u201cThen I\u2019ll go catch another one.\u201dCatch another what?The butler didn\u2019t want to know\u2026\u2026.He only came here to lure the other party into making a small mistake. He didn\u2019t want to drag himself into this.No way!Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: It\u2019s hard being a villain nowadays\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No, the two bandits did not hold back when threatening others. It even made the witchdoctor mistakenly think that he was actually the good and helpless one.Those animals were bought here by him to be used as blood sacrifices. He didn\u2019t expect it to be used like this.He could change into all kinds of shells; male or female, young or old, and he could tolerate that. He could even piece together different body parts\u2026\u2026\u2026But not for animals, let alone those that have been confined in the dungeon until they were about to grow mould.It was the most effective form of threat for him.With the pigs\u2019 eyes watching him, the witchdoctor was practically ready to answer anything he was asked.From him, You Huo and Qin Jiu found out about the general situation \u2014\u2014-There was indeed an outbreak of Black Death in Carlton Mountain. The disease spread rapidly and no one in the huge ancient castle was spared. With her weak physique, the Duchess passed away in within two days.The Duke who was closest to her also suffered from a serious case of the disease and only managed to last two days longer than her.After that, it was the servants.Douglas the head butler lasted the longest. He got people to clear away with the dead servants and set up a coffin for the Duke and his wife.The day before the burial, the witchdoctor came to the castle.At that time, the witchdoctor hadn\u2019t borrowed the nun\u2019s body and was hiding in his old shell. He would sway slightly whenever he walked.This person who looked like he was on the verge of death said to Douglas: \u201cI can bring your Master and his wife back to life.\u201d\u201cGo and find a pair that\u2019s similar to them. The more similar, the better.\u201d\u201cAppearance and status are of secondary importance. The most important thing is their heart and soul.\u201dThe witchdoctor said this to Douglas.After giving him hope, he added: \u201cThe resurrection process is a little gruesome, but it is a sacred ritual. As someone who resurrects them, you must willingly sacrifice yourself.\u201dDouglas said: \u201cOkay.\u201dLate at night, he tricked a travelling couple and dragged them into the bedroom after rendering them unconscious.He then pried open the coffin that was about to be buried and brought the Duke and his wife back.In the silent and empty bedroom, he cut off the head, limbs, chest and waist of the Duke and again pieced them together. Candle wax that was dripped onto the knife solidified into a milky-white film.He drank a few glasses of wine, sat on the ground for a moment while the witchdoctor watched on before proceeding to cut up Alyssa like a melon.White candles were place around them in a circle.The witchdoctor pointed at the two unlucky travellers and asked Douglas: \u201cOkay, one last step left. I\u2019ll confirm it with you again, are these two unfortunate people here indeed similar to the Duke and the Duchess? If they\u2019re not, it won\u2019t succeed.\u201dDouglas half knelt before the couple and poured wine onto them to wake them up.With his back facing the witchdoctor, he said without looking back: \u201cIt\u2019s similar. They are very much in love.\u201dUnder the couples devastating cries, Douglas reached out and placed his hands on their heads.\u2026\u2026\u2026.That night, the Duke was resurrected.The rotten parts of his body were replaced by parts from the traveller\u2019s body. This included most of his face too.When he opened his eyes, the young butler Douglas turned old at a speed that was visible to the naked eye. In an instant, be became an old man.Everything was as the witchdoctor had said\u2026\u2026..Unfortunately, the Duchess failed to be resurrected.***The witchdoctor licked his lips and said: \u201cI still remember the Duke\u2019s expression at that time. Next to him was his chopped up wife, in the mirror was his pieced together face, the ground was covered in blood and there was an old unfamiliar looking butler too\u2026\u2026..Hah.\u201dHe narrowed his eyes and looked at the old butler who was also tied up: \u201cYou are the most ruthless person I\u2019ve ever encountered. I was not as resolute as you when I did it the first time and even shed some crocodile tears.\u201d\u201cBut the Duke surprised me too.\u201dIn the witchdoctor\u2019s eyes, the castle brought forth many hidden talents.The butler cut people up like melons without any hesitation and the resurrected Duke was also only in shock for a few minutes before calmly accepting the situation.The witchdoctor said that there were too many servants in the castle, and it was too troublesome resurrecting them one by one. He had a way to let them continue existing, but they would be neither alive nor dead, like ghosts trapped inside the castle for life.The Duke thanked him.The witchdoctor also said: \u201cWhat about your wife? Rebury her?\u201dThe Duke found a large wooden box and instructed Douglas to put Alyssa in it before replying: \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I can occasionally invite some guests over\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf there is a pair of lovers or a married couple like myself and Alyssa,\u201d the Duke said, \u201cI have enough patience to wait. Douglas will always be with me, right?\u201dDouglas echoed: \u201cI will always be here. I will find the most suitable and loving guests for you.\u201dThe master and servant strangely worked well together.When the witchdoctor proposed that \u201cthe act of continuously resurrecting and changing bodies incurs curses, you will lose your body\u201d, they didn\u2019t hesitate to transfer it over to the small town behind Carlton Mountain.***\u201cHow is the curse transferred?\u201d You Huo held down the other party\u2019s wrist.The witchdoctor hesitated and didn\u2019t want to speak. He struggled to get his hand out of his grasp and wanted to move back a little \u2013 at least an inch more away from the pig. Unfortunately, no matter how hard he tried, the opponent held firm.The witchdoctor struggled until his face was red.\u201cHow could you bear being so rough with a lady?\u201d He asked You Huo while wearing the nun\u2019s skin.You Huo remained indifferent: \u201cI can be even more rough.\u201dThe witchdoctor shut his mouth.He took advantage of his close proximity to You Huo and stared into his eyes. Since the other method didn\u2019t work, he wanted to try and confuse You Huo with seduction: \u201cThis beautiful gentleman, I actually still have a lot\u2014\u2014\u2014ugh!\u201dHalfway through his words, Qin Jiu pressed him down with his knee on his back.Please read this from kk translatesThe witchdoctor collapsed onto the ground, his lips kissing the pig.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dQin Jiu glanced at You Huo before threateningly looking down at the witchdoctor: \u201cYou\u2019re seducing the wrong person. Can\u2019t you see that this beautiful gentleman over here is very annoyed? But compared to him, I\u2019m a little more ruthless.\u201dHis low voice sounded next to the witchdoctor\u2019s ear. It sounded like a devil\u2019s voice: \u201cCutting up a pig is no problem. Cutting a human like you is also not a problem. If you continue being so uncooperative, I\u2019m afraid you might not even have a whole pig and would only get the pigs head.\u201d\u201cCombining a pig and a sheep sounds good too.\u201dWitchdoctor: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe beautiful gentleman sang in harmony with the devil. He said coldly: \u201cThree options. I\u2019ll give you three seconds to decide.\u201dThe witchdoctor felt like he had ran into a couple of psychopaths.\u201c3.\u201d\u201c2.\u201dThe witchdoctor immediately spilled: \u201cFood and wine.\u201d\u201cThe food the Duke prepared for the townspeople are the medium for the transfer. After eating those things, it\u2019s equivalent to agreeing to sacrifice themselves. The more they eat, the deeper they are bound and the sooner they will be cursed.\u201d\u201cFood and wine?\u201dYou Huo suddenly recalled Zhou Qi\u2019s fever after not eating anything and turned to the butler: \u201cThe food provided to the guests at the castle are like this too?\u201dDouglas didn\u2019t speak. It could be taking as silent affirmation.The witchdoctor interjected: \u201cOf course. After luring guests over, even if the Duke doesn\u2019t use your body, he can use you to block part of the curse so why waste it?\u201dYou Huo and Qin Jiu looked at each other. They frowned at the same time.If the scope of the curse was not limited to the town and even included examinees, then those bloodied half-dead people in the church probably aren\u2019t all townspeople.\u201cHow to get rid of the curse?\u201d You Huo asked the witchdoctor.The witchdoctor said: \u201cDidn\u2019t you listen in earlier? Like I said, you just need to transfer it to another person.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m talking about getting rid of it completely.\u201dYou Huo bent down and looked at him coldly.The witchdoctor\u2019s eyes met with his. He said defeatedly: \u201cKill the cursed or kill the duke.\u201d\u201cYOU\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201dThe butler who had his head lowered suddenly straightened up. Just as he wanted to speak, Qin Jiu stuffed a pig hoof in.The witchdoctor snickered and repeated: \u201cJust kill the Duke.\u201dThose one-sided words of his could have contained hidden motives. Qin Jiu glanced at the bloodied man curled up in the corner: \u201cPriest?\u201dThe bloodied man laid there like he was dead. After a moment, he looked up weakly and nodded: \u201cI remember this\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cThanks.\u201dHis eyes scanned between the witchdoctor and the butler. He then suddenly said jokingly: \u201cThe interrogation is temporarily over. Big Invigilator, what do you think? Rank A, B, C or D?\u201dYou Huo released his hold and indicated at the witchdoctor with his chin: \u201cC for this one. Re-examination.\u201dWitchdoctor: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe then indicated at Douglas: \u201cD, elimination.\u201dQin Jiu raised his hand and tapped his forehead to salute mischievously: \u201cGive me half a minute.\u201dThe edges of Douglas\u2019s wrinkled lips turned down. A hint of despair was evident on his face.***The darkness underground makes people forget about the time. By the time You Huo and Qin Jiu exited the small hut, the sky was already starting to get darker.The sky in the distance was overcast with dark clouds. It slowly moved closer.They wore their formal coat and returned to the church only to find everyone crowding around the bowling pins. The mood was a little strange.Gao Qi called out to them from afar: \u201cYou\u2019re finally back. We were about to go search the back for you.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Qin Jiu glanced at the crowd.Gao Qi: \u201cWe found some clues and found out what it means by curing the patient.\u201dEveryone turned over a few of the stretcher beds and showed the blood writing underneath it to You Huo and Qin Jiu.\u201cThere are repetitive parts. Putting it together, it says\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Gao Qi took a deep breath and said: \u201cThey can be freed by killing them.\u201dHe also pointed at one of the beds and said: \u201cThis is definitely something an examinee left. Three points for killing a patient, not capped.\u201dAfter killing them all, perhaps the exam would end.But You Huo counted roughly. Except for the priest who had ran off, the original 25 people here were still present. Not one was missing.Not one of the examinees had moved to earn points.Qin Jiu raised his eyebrow.Before he could speak, an examinee mumbled: \u201cIn addition to that, we also found something else. We think\u2026\u2026..among these patients, at least four or five of them are like us. They\u2019re examinees from another session.\u201dIf they were just NPC\u2019s they wouldn\u2019t feel burdened if they had to kill.Until now, who hasn\u2019t killed a few small monsters?But when they learnt that there were real people among them, no one could do it.3 points. That was quite an impressive number for most.But like Gao Qi and Zhao Jiatong had said, they had not reached that point of desperation.Please read this from kk translatesThey were not desperate enough to kill an examinee for those three points. That was a big relief.But this mood was soon to be broken. Qin Jiu told everyone about the information they got from the dungeon.Everyone\u2019s faces turned green in an instant.Gao Qi\u2019s face was the greenest of them all.He drank more than everyone else combined. If the curse was to be inflicted onto them, he would be amongst the top three.***The rainstorm started just before nightfall.Under the curtain of rain, the old castle sat there like a predatory beast lying in wait.In a large bedroom on the first floor of the west tower, the Duke was taking his anger out on the male servants. He smashed a cup splattering an oil painting in the process and kicked over everything that could be kicked over in the room\u2026\u2026\u2026Because the butler was nowhere in sight.A dozen carriages carrying the guests returned. The only one missing was Douglas.Wasn\u2019t he the best at inducing the guests into making mistakes? What was taking him so long?The Duke turned the ring on his hand. The mood around him was so poor, no one dared to approach.For a moment, he suspected that Douglas may have joined forces with the witchdoctor. Perhaps they were doing something behind his back.But soon, he persuaded himself again.Anyone could betray him, but Douglas wouldn\u2019t.\u201cMaster, it\u2019s time for dinner.\u201d A male servant reminded.Even though the servants were no longer living and every action they did exuded the scent of death, they could still feel fear.The Duke paused for a moment before commanding darkly: \u201cIf Douglas returns, tell him to get his ass over to me. I have to teach him properly about punctuality.\u201dWhen he was done, he changed into his masked smile and turned into the dinner hall.Today\u2019s dinner was very strange.The guests all stared at the wine and roast chicken with dignified expressions. Only three gentlemen performed outstandingly\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Like they were cursed by something, You Huo and Qin Jiu unhurriedly tasted all the food like they did the night before.As for Gao Qi\u2026\u2026\u2026.Since he couldn\u2019t be saved anyway, he simply let himself go and drank freely.The Duke gently tapped his glass and said with a smile: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? My dear guests don\u2019t have an appetite today? This was carefully prepared by the chefs. If you don\u2019t eat, I\u2019ll be a little sad.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dOkay, everything is as you say.The examinees took a deep breath. Wearing the expression if someone who was about to head out to war, they picked up a tiny piece of chicken skin\u2026\u2026.The duke crossed his fingers. The eyes behind the mask curved.At 10 o\u2019clock in the evening, dinner was over.The Duke sat at the head of the table and watched the examinees leave the hall. His eyes were constantly following the two perfect gentlemen. Inside, he looked forwards to Douglas\u2019s return and the good news he would bring with him.When the last examinee left, a male servant hurried over.\u201cMaster.\u201d\u201cYes. Did Douglas return?\u201dThe male servant\u2019s gey face changed into several colours. He stiffly nodded and said: \u201cYes, just returned\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cWhere is he? Waiting for me in the bedroom?\u201dThe male servant hesitated: \u201cNo.\u201dThe Duke frowned: \u201cWhy?\u201dThe male servant shrank back: \u201cButler\u2026\u2026..um\u2026\u2026went into his bedroom as soon as he came back.\u201dThe Duke was a little angry and also a little puzzled.He made the male servant lead the way and headed straight for Douglas\u2019s bedroom with a stern expression.\u201cWhat the hell are you doing, Douglas?\u201d The Duke immediately reprimanded as he opened the door.The answer he expected didn\u2019t come.The person he expected to see wasn\u2019t there.\u201cWhere is he?!\u201d The Duke glared at the servant.The servant pointed at the corner of the bedroom: \u201cTh\u2026..there\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Duke looked over:A pig wrapped in the butler\u2019s shirt laid there paralysed. A parchment was tied to the shirt collar.The Duke strode over and removed it.The handwriting on the paper said:Master, I am Douglas. You made me go and create some trouble for the guests.Are you satisfied with this trouble?Kind regards.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe Duke almost died from anger.He crushed the parchment paper with shaking fists and turned to leave the bedroom.As he walked, he said to the male servant: \u201cI want the bodies of those two guests tonight! Don\u2019t let a single one get away!\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: \ud83d\udc37\ud83d\udc37\ud83d\udc37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They felt more and more uneasy.The sensitive nosed Zhou Qi also said that she smelt something. It was stronger than before.Zhao Jiatong searched the room completely from the bottom of the bed to the wardrobe and the blankets but was unable to find the source.Before going to bed, Zhou Qi suddenly leaned against the wall beside the door and sniffed it for a moment before saying: \u201cSister Tong\u2026\u2026.It seems to be coming from the wall.\u201dHearing this, Zhao Jiatong\u2019s hair stood up.\u201cXiao Zhou, tell me honestly what field you worked in.\u201d Zhao Jiatong said jokingly to try and ease the atmosphere.Zhou Qi waved her hand: \u201cNo, it\u2019s really not it. I just have a dog\u2019s nose.\u201dShe used her coat as a blanket and laid down onto the carpet. Looking at the candle chandelier above her head for a while, she suddenly said: \u201cBut I haven\u2019t been this sensitive before. Maybe this exam is special.\u201dZhou Jiatong laid down beside her. She thought inside: It is indeed special.Special to the point that\u2026\u2026\u2026. It was as if there was something in the exam secretly giving Zhou Qi warnings.Zhao Jiatong closed her eyes and secretly thought this. She then paid careful attention to sounds next door.With the bastardly things A and 001 did, if she was the Duke, even she would go mad. It would be impossible for her not to go find them to pay them back. As soon as the Duke comes, she plans to secretly follow.However, when there really were sounds coming from outside, she was unable to do so.Because Zhou Qi again had a fever.This young lady\u2019s fever was very high, and she was also having a nightmare.She struggled with knitted brows and mumbled incoherently as she dreamed but she just couldn\u2019t wake up.Zhao Jiatong moved closer and could vaguely make out: \u201c\u2026\u2026I want\u2026\u2026.Why won\u2019t you let me see\u2026\u2026.\u201dAfter that it was crying and whimpering.With two consecutive nights of high fever, it was too strange.Zhao Jiatong couldn\u2019t help but recall Qin Jiu\u2019s words\u2026\u2026..This sickness seemed to be deliberately restraining Zhou Qi to prevent her from venturing out late at night.Was it to prevent her from encountering something?Or was it to prevent her from seeing someone?***The walls of the long corridor were dimly light at night. All the servants in the castle had disappeared. It was empty before the doors, like they were never there in the first place.Suddenly, there were footsteps coming from the stairs.Several male servants went up to the third floor. The one at the front held an oil lamp while the others walked behind him in a line.Their faces were half illuminated by the swaying light. With their faces taut and expressions stiff and expressionless, they looked lifeless.The unfortunate butler had been turned into a pig and was unable to help the Duke, so it was now their job to get the guests.\u201cIt\u2019s ahead.\u201d The servant at the front said quietly.He pointed at a door in the distance and instructed another servant: \u201cGo knock. The others should block off the room.\u201d\u201cWhat about the other one?\u201d The servant who was tasked to knock raised his hand and asked hesitantly: \u201cDidn\u2019t Master ask us to get two?\u201dPlease read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen. Please don\u2019t support those thieves, the translator KK is going to cry\u2026The leader said: \u201cIt\u2019s next door. Once we invite this one over, we will invite the other one. We have many people, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201dThey formed a semicircle and the servant knocked on the wooden door.Knock\u2014\u2014\u2014After one knock, the door opened.Male servant: \u201c?\u201dYou Huo who opened the door looked at them expressionlessly.The servant opened his mouth and forgot his lines for a few seconds. He then said mechanically: \u201cGood evening, sir. You\u2026\u2026.didn\u2019t sleep?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d You Huo was taller than this servant. When he looked at him, he looked down through half-lidded eyes. The servant who was neither dead nor alive panicked.The servant froze again. For a moment, he didn\u2019t speak.It was the one holding the lamp who spoke: \u201cIf you haven\u2019t slept, that\u2019s great. The Duke would like to invite you over for a chat.\u201dAs he said that, the other male servant gripped tightly on a metal rod behind his back.From what they have seen, guests would always panic when they are invited, and they would try to yell.The butler Douglas would always carry some equipment with him, and this metal rod was something he usually used.The servant got ready to strike as soon as the guest shouts.But unexpectedly, that person said: \u201cOh.\u201dThe male servant almost struck his leader\u2019s face with that rod.Awkward expressions slowly appeared on their pale faces. The man who held the lamp took a step back to make way for You Huo.Unexpectedly, this guest took a step and then stopped. He turned to the room and said: \u201cWe\u2019re going, hurry up.\u201dThe servants were stunned. They said: \u201cWhat? Madam also isn\u2019t asleep?\u201dYou Huo who heard the word \u201cmadam\u201d glanced at him.The servant maintained a stern expression: \u201cThe Duke only invited sir. Ma\u2014-\u201dHe wanted to say: Madam, please wait here.But when You Huo pulled the door open, it revealed a man a little taller than him.Male servant: \u201c?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t finish his \u201cma\u201dHe stared at the lower half of Qin Jiu\u2019s face and froze for a second before stepping back and checking the room number. He said calmly: \u201cThe Duke said that married couples should stay in the same room. Why is sir here in the middle of the night?\u201d\u201cWhy do you think?\u201d Qin Jiu asked.Male servant: \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe took this in, and his expression remained stiff: \u201cThe Duke doesn\u2019t like unfaithful people. We were also going to get you. Since this is the case, can both please come with us.\u201dQin Jiu didn\u2019t care. He calmly walked out.He then turned and looked into the room.Inside, a third person yawned. He mumbled: \u201cHey, wait for me to put my shoes on.\u201dServant: \u201c???\u201dWhile putting on his boots, Gao Qi hopped out. His stubble came face to face with the male servant.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe expression on servants pale face was indecipherable. He then waved his hand: \u201cTake them all away!\u201dWhat a joke. Three men\u2026\u2026\u2026How could something so ridiculous be accommodated in this castle!With just this, Master will definitely scare them until they cry.***The corridor was still dim. The same oil paintings hung on the stone wall.Three servants followed behind Qin Jiu. With them half surrounding him, he walked at the front.The servants also surrounded You Huo. They walked about seven or eight metres behind Qin JiuTwo more steps behind them was Gao Qi and the rest of the servants.The oil lamp held by the servant creaked. The light from it was like turbulent water; suddenly bright, suddenly dim. It left a long shaking shadow behind Qin Jiu.When You Huo removed his eyes from the oil paintings, this was what he saw.Please read this from kk translatesHe suddenly felt that he had seen a scene like this many times\u2026\u2026The same long corridor, the same lingering stare\u2026..There would always be a group of people following behind Qin Jiu. The same was for him too. Occasionally, he could hear Gao Qi\u2019s long yawn.Sometimes they were walking towards each other, other times they walked one after the other just like now.Either way, there was always a neither short nor long distance between them.For some reason\u2026\u2026.He had always felt that Qin Jiu would suddenly stop to grab some documents or something and lazily talk to the people around him.As for him, with the group including Gao Qi\u2026\u2026he would continue walking.When they passed, Qin Jiu would casually glance over while talking before looking away.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cWhy are you walking faster and faster. Showing off your long legs?\u201d Gao Qi\u2019s voice sounded.You Huo returned to his senses. At this moment, he realised that he had unknowingly increased his speed and was just a few steps away from the person ahead.When Qin Jiu turned the corner, he stopped. His eyes fell past the three servants and stopped at you Huo.This time he didn\u2019t look away. He winked at You Huo and said: \u201cHurry up. We shouldn\u2019t make the Duke wait.\u201dAs they descended to the first floor and got closer and closer to the bedroom on the first floor of the west tower, the others started to move.If the male servants walked a little slower, they would be able to hear faint phone alarms going off past the closed wooden doors.Soon afterwards, a door on the third floor quietly opened.A head came out. It looked around before turning and saying to the people inside: \u201cThey should be downstairs. I just heard some sounds just now.\u201dSoon afterwards, another door nearby opened.A second head stuck out. It even waved at the first head.And then there was a third, and a fourth\u2026\u2026.In a blink of an eye, most of the examinees came out from their room.This was something they had agreed on previously.Since killing the Duke can get rid of the curse, when was it a better time to do it than today?If they could finish the exam early, they could return and take a break early too.They lowered their voices and gestured to each other quietly before silently slipping down to the first floor.***The large bedroom on the first floor of the west tower was terrifyingly quiet.The Duke wore a long hood. Its silk hem swept across the ground.He was currently lying out candles for Douglas.His face was astonishingly pale. It was probably because blood no longer flowed. The curve at the corner of his mouth clearly showed that he was currently in a bad mood. He was very angry. He was angry at both the pig acting dead in front of him, and also the guests that were heading this way.With the candles set up, he straightened up and pulled out a towel to wipe the bone cleaver.He narrowed his eyes and licked his lips: \u201cDouglas, your negligence worries me. Without you, it takes me more time and effort to take control of those two.\u201d\u201cOf course, this extra time and effort is negligible.Afterall, most of the time the guests would be in a state of fright.\u201cHopefully those stupid servants dragged two gentlemen here with their faces facing up. I told them but it\u2019s hard to say whether they will remember. Afterall\u2026..Afterall, they\u2019re too stupid. They\u2019re still different from living beings.He touched the blade and again muttered: \u201cBut when they were alive, they also weren\u2019t very clever. I still remember that one time when Alyssa caught a cold. Those idiots made it worse and she only recovered after a month.\u201dThe Duke paused and glanced under the bed: \u201cMy Alyssa\u2026\u2026.Hey\u2026..Wait until I have dealt with the two gentlemen and I\u2019ll help you find their wife. Just wait a little more. Just a little more\u2026\u2026..\u201d He softly joked: \u201cFirst, let\u2019s let our butler look more human.\u201dFootsteps were heard outside the door.The Duke hummed a tune in excitement. He placed his knife behind him and stood at the door waiting to greet the unfortunate guests.But when the door opened, the male servants respectfully urged three people into the room with their heads lowered.Three men\u2026..Three men who are all taller than the Duke and stronger than the Duke.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe Duke\u2019s smile immediately disappeared.The tallest Mr. Perfect glanced at the pig and candles before smiling: \u201cYo, have you completed all the preparations?\u201dAs he said that, he pulled out two pairs of white gentleman gloves from his pocket, patted it and handed it to the person next to him.The other cold and aloof Mr. Perfect received it. He wore it and then pulled out a knife: \u201cResolve it quickly and cleanly.\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: OMG I lol\u2019d at the servants reactionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was eye catching, and it also carried a strange hint of attractiveness.After Qin Jiu held down the struggling Duke\u2019s hands and suppressed it with his knee, he looked up and was met with this scene.The fire on the wall flickered. They stood very close together.So close, they could feel each other\u2019s body heat whenever the other party moved.Qin Jiu stared at the two winding trails of blood for a few seconds. He then pointed at his own neck: \u201cHere\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d You Huo who heard him looked up. His light-coloured eyes carried a questioning look, but his hands plunged the knife deeper in without any hesitation.As he did that sort of action, he carried a cold and dangerous temperament. Together with the red streaks along his pale porcelain neck, it was bewitching.Qin Jiu stopped speaking and stared at it for a while under the flickering flames: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. The blood almost stained your collar.\u201dAs he said that, he reached out to wipe the blood off.The glove fabric was thicker and rougher than silk. As it rubbed across the skin, you could almost feel its distinct texture.For a moment, You Huo\u2019s neck stiffened. He however didn\u2019t avoid it.He just turned his head slightly and briefly narrowed his eyes. His eyes then fell onto Qin Jiu\u2019s hand.The gloves didn\u2019t fit perfectly. It wrapped loosely around his fingers.\u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d Qin Jiu rubbed his fingertips and showed him the stains on his blood and index finger, \u201cBut\u2026\u2026Did I use too much force just now, or is Big Invigilator\u2019s skin too thin?\u201dHe glanced at the side of You Huo\u2019s neck: \u201cYour neck here is a little red.\u201dGao Qi who also contributed was cleaning the battlefield.After rummaging through the Duke\u2019s room, he wanted to say something to You Huo and Qin Jiu but he instinctively withdrew the foot he had stepped out with.The Duke was still twitching on the ground, but there was a strange atmosphere between those two.It was hard to say why it was strange, but he just couldn\u2019t take that step.Maybe that circle of candles has a barrier function.Gao Qi internally thought this.***The Duke\u2019s movements grew smaller and smaller. After a few final twitches of his finger, the eyes under the mask widened and his pupils slowly dilated.You Huo loosed his grip, pulled out the knife and stood up. As he touched his neck, he kicked his calf and said: \u201cFinally dead.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s really dead?\u201d Gao Qi only now came over. He circled around the Duke\u2019s stiff body, pried off his mask and used the tip of his knife to open his shirt collar.Fine lines that resembled stitches formed a dividing line separating different skins. Seeing it at such a close range made one feel chilling nausea.\u201cFuck\u2026\u2026\u2026.He\u2019s really pieced together.\u201d Gao Qi quietly cursed.As soon as he finished saying this, a voice that had been absent for a while suddenly spoke up\u2014\u2014-\u3010Point acquirement detected.\u3011\u3010Examinees You Huo, Qin Jiu and Gao Qi has triggered a total of 1 factor.\u3011\u30101. Stopped the Duke\u2019s heart.\u3011\u3010The scores are calculated as follows:\u3011\u3010A total of 9 points for killing the Duke which are distributed according to contribution and 1 point for the last blow.\u3011\u3010The points of each examinee have been recalculated.\u3011Gao Qi received 2 points.Qin Jiu received 4 points.You Huo received 3 points. The last blow accounted for one point.Gao Qi was stunned for a moment before mumbling: \u201cI let myself go too far when I\u2019m with you two. I almost forgot about earning points.\u201dNot to mention him, even You Huo and Qin Jiu were surprised.The examination system had been quiet throughout this exam and they had almost forgotten about its existence.\u201cBut it\u2019s a bit strange.\u201d Gao Qi said, \u201cThe Duke is dead so shouldn\u2019t those patients be freed? We should\u2019ve met the conditions so why didn\u2019t the exam end?\u201d\u201cMaybe the patients need time to recover.\u201d Qin Jiu said.Gao Qi nodded: \u201cThen that shouldn\u2019t be long. They might recover by tomorrow morning.\u201dJust the thought of this pleased him.He straightened up but he then saw You Huo staring at the Duke\u2019s face lost in thought.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Gao Qi asked.You Huo answered: \u201cHis face looks a little familiar.\u201d\u201cYou know him?\u201d Qin Jiu also looked over.You Huo shook his head.This sense of familiarity wasn\u2019t to the extent of knowing. He felt that it was a face he had probably seen on passing recently. It didn\u2019t leave him with a strong impression.It wasn\u2019t until Gao Qi pulled out his phone with the intention to take a photo of commemoration that You Huo finally remembered.\u201cZhou Qi\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201dGao Qi and Qin Jiu were both surprised.\u201cHow do you know what Xiao Zhou\u2019s boyfriend looks like?\u201d Gao Qi wondered.\u201cPhone screensaver.\u201d You Huo explained.Zhou Qi\u2019s phone screensaver was a photo of her boyfriend. Whenever she was lost in thought during dinner or taking her phone out to take a photo, that face would constantly light up and darken in Zhou Qi\u2019s hand.When they were assigned to the same room, Zhou Qi had briefly mentioned this to You Huo to avoid awkwardness.As she mentioned it, her face and ears were completely red. Her expression was mostly filled with worry, but it also carried a hint of happiness that couldn\u2019t be concealed.Please read this from kk translatesIt was very obvious that this young couple got along very well.Zhou Qi had mentioned that if she could get out of here alive, the first thing she wanted to do was to drag her boyfriend to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.\u201cNow that you mentioned it, I remember!\u201dGao Qi\u2019s face instantly changed. He squatted down and stared at the face for a long time before murmuring: \u201cSeems to really be\u2026\u2026..that Xiao Zhou\u2019s\u2014\u2014-\u201cHis words stopped there. He let out a long sigh: \u201cIf she knows, my god\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe bedroom fell into silence.The three of them looked at the Duke\u2019s pale face with complicated emotions.As soon as the room fell silent, the sounds outside became more obvious.Gao Qi couldn\u2019t help but look up at the door. He said with a frown: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What\u2019s happening outside?\u201dThey suddenly realised that the other examinees should have already left their rooms. According to their plans, they should arrive only a few minutes after them.Even if they crawled\u2026\u2026they should\u2019ve already reached the door. Why wasn\u2019t anyone around?Booom\u2014\u2014\u2014There was another sound outside. It sounded like someone lifting something heavy and smashing it against the wall.Soon following that were some faint voices which were mixed with shouts.It sounded horribly chaotic.\u201cTake a look.\u201d Qin Jiu said.You Huo flicked off the blood on the knife and walked to the door.After just taking two steps, he remembered something and walked back.He picked up the mask on the ground and placed it back onto the Duke\u2019s face.He didn\u2019t know if Zhou Qi would come downstairs.Although she should take another look at this young man\u2019s face, it shouldn\u2019t be done like this nor in this situation.***As soon as the three of them exited the bedroom, they were greeted with cries and shouts ringing throughout the castle.They didn\u2019t expect the soundproofing of the room to be so good.Along the long and dim corridor, the oil paintings shook causing its wooden frames to knock against the stone wall. It looked like it would fall off any moment.Their first thought was that an earthquake had struck causing the entire castle to shake.But in reality, the floor under their feet was very stable. The only thing shaking were the tall, damp walls.The cries came from inside the walls.It was as if\u2026\u2026.there were countless people sealed inside those thick stone walls.As the fire on the walls swayed, the shadows casted onto the walls looked like they were alive and struggling to break away. Following the damp corridor, they made their way towards the others.The examinees had been thrown into chaos.Wall smashing, throwing punches, tumbling\u2026\u2026Some were evading, others\u2026..looked like they were possessed.The three of them rushed over without any hesitation. They each held a knife and in a blink of an eye knocked down a bunch of them.When they reached the second floor, Gao Qi saw that two of the bedroom doors were open. He immediately shouted: \u201cOld Zhao!!! Are you awake?! Wake up and knock them out\u2014\u2014\u201dZhao Jiatong and Yang Shu looked out at the same time. Yang Shu took in the situation and bent down.You Huo guessed that she was probably taking off her heels.Sure enough, the next second a shoe flew out smashing into someone\u2019s face.Zhao Jiatong on the other hand held up her large dress and sent out a flying kick.She didn\u2019t even forget to retort: \u201cGet rid of that old!\u201d\u201cXiao Zhao!! Nice!\u201d Gao Qi shouted this as he knocked out another two.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on\u2014\u2013?!\u201d Zhao Jiatong shouted: \u201cXiao Zhou has a fever again. Should I bring her down?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Gao Qi thought of the Duke\u2019s face and immediately said, \u201cNot now. It\u2019s even more crazy downstairs. There are fewer people upstairs. Go and lock doors. Leave the rest to us!\u201dYou Huo slashed across a dark shadow but the knife went through it like it was plunged into water.The shadow sank in, and then quickly climbed up his arm.You Huo clicked his tongue in disgust. He pulled his knife out and jumped to the side to avoid it.Along the way, he pulled back an examinee who was about to jump out castle window. When he turned to look back, he found himself blinded by bright light.It was the torch light from Qin Jiu\u2019s phone.Everywhere the light swept across, the shadows scattered and retreated.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter a few seconds of speechlessness, You Huo also took out his phone.\u201cYou can do something like that?\u201d Gao Qi dragged an examinee away from the wall and similarly turned on the flashlight function on his phone. He held his phone like it was a lightsaber.The shadow moved swiftly along the parts of the walls that were still in the dark. Just as it was about to come out, it was pushed back by Gao Qi with his light.When it was about to come out again, it was pushed back by You Huo.In another attempt, Qin Jiu was waiting on the other end.Shadow: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dIn the end, Gao Qi stood in the corridor sweeping his phone back and forth.Miss Yang\u2019s crisp voice floated down from upstairs: \u201cI dare you to lift my skirt! I dare you!\u201d\u201cSo annoying\u2014\u2014-How do you fight\u2014\u2014-this thing!\u201d Zhao Jiatong dragged her dress along as she fought.Miss Yang avoided a sneak attack before turning around and rushing over to the other end of the corridor. When she looked down, she saw Gao Qi standing there calmly waving his phone around.\u201c\u2026\u2026.Who are you cheering for?\u201dAs soon as she asked that, Miss Yang suddenly understood. She knocked her head: \u201cI became dumb at a critical moment.\u201dVery soon, under the cheering lights\u2026\u2026.Ahem, under the bright lights, the shadows escaped.On the stone walls, they twisted and writhed around, disgusting the two ladies.The mixture of men and women\u2019s\u2019 cries were very harsh to the ears. It continued on for a while.A bell suddenly rang from somewhere in the tower. The cries came to an abrupt halt and the shadows instantly scattered across the wall. Looking at it now, it looked like it had turned back into normal shadows.The earthquake-like shaking also subsided. You Huo pried off the examinee who almost jumped out the castle.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netIt was a short man.Thanks to his short legs, it made it difficult for him to climb the stone railing. If not for that, You Huo wouldn\u2019t have been able to catch him in time.He was in shock for a moment. He violently shook his head to wake himself up. As soon as he returned to his senses he slid down the stone railing and crumpled onto the ground in fear: \u201cI\u2026\u2026I\u2026\u2026..Did I almost fall off just now?\u201dYou Huo comforted him: \u201cYes.\u201dThe young man leaned against the wall fearfully for a while before saying: \u201cThank you. That scared me\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Gao Qi and Qin Jiu came over to ask.\u201cI don\u2019t know. We set an alarm and followed you down when we saw that you\u2019ve reached the first floor.\u201d The man pointed in the direction of the west tower: \u201cAt that time there were many servants outside. Seeing that there were more of us, we tried to get through by force.\u201d\u201cWe originally wanted to enter after knocking them out but for some reason those servants suddenly turned around and ran.\u201d\u201cRan?\u201d Qin Jiu asked.The man thought for a moment and said: \u201cYou can\u2019t really call that running, I guess. They went to the main entrance and then\u2026..disappeared. I thought they looked a little scared. The walls then started to shake. We thought the castle was going to collapse and even got ready to get you guys out of the room. As soon as we rushed over, those shadows on the walls came alive and even started crying!\u201dHe rubbed his arm nervously: \u201cThose cries made me feel dizzy. I felt like I was dreaming\u2026..I saw\u2026\u2026saw someone being beheaded. The Duke was standing there with one hand grabbing that person\u2019s hair and holding a knife in the other hand\u2026..That man struggled desperately to escape and I was also escaping but someone had grabbed my collar to stop me from moving.\u201dThe man shot You Huo a glance: \u201cAnd then you know what happened afterwards.\u201dThis sounded familiar.You Huo and Qin Jiu looked at Gao Qi at the same time. Gao Qi scratched his cheek: \u201cIt\u2019s similar to my first day.\u201dIt likely wasn\u2019t just the two of them. All those examinees that looked like they were possessed were probably in the same situation.\u201cSo, the person I saw was an examinee who was cut up?\u201d Gao Qi didn\u2019t have a good expression.He thought of the woman on the bed who suddenly crumbled into pieces and then he thought of Xiao Qi\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s head. He felt a little sick inside.\u201cWith so many deaths, it\u2019s normal to be haunted.\u201d Gao Qi sighed.Who would be willing to be cut up like that and pieced together with other body parts?He turned his head and saw You Huo staring at the wall. He wondered: \u201cBut why was the wall reacting so strongly? Is there a problem with the paintings?\u201dWhen it came to the walls, the first thing that came to everyone\u2019s mind were the paintings.With a picture of the strange Duke and his family hung up every few metres, it indeed looked very strange at night.The examinees gradually woke up one after another. They started discussing the earlier incident.Several braver examinees entered the Duke\u2019s bedroom to see how the Duke died.You Huo stood by the wall. Just as he was about to reach out and touch it, he suddenly heard noise from nearby.He turned to look and saw a group of examinees escaping out of the Duke\u2019s bedroom like a tide. They looked like they saw something terrifying.The next second, he understood.One examinee exclaimed: \u201cIsn\u2019t the Duke dead?\u201dYou Huo and Qin Jiu exchanged glances.The other party frowned and said: \u201cIs this what I\u2019m thinking it is?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026.Take a look.\u201dThey hurried to the Duke\u2019s room. Candlelight leaked out through the half-open door.Examinees standing next to the door gestured wildly. You Huo went over to the door and looked through the opening \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 The Duke who was killed earlier was standing in front of the mirror flexing his neck while buttoning his collar.He finally understood why the system didn\u2019t directly end the exam.It was because the exam hadn\u2019t ended. That bastard Duke was alive again.It was as if everything that had happened earlier hadn\u2019t happened at all.If it wasn\u2019t for the system saying \u3010Stopped the Duke\u2019s heart\u3011, he would have even suspected that everything earlier was an illusion.Qin Jiu pulled his gloves up and tilted his head towards the door: \u201cGo again?\u201dYou Huo expressed his agreement to this practical suggestion\u2014\u2014-Holding their knives, they pushed the door and entered.Everything played out like it was being replayed.The Duke arranged his hair, picked up the knife on the table and turned around\u2026\u2026And was met with three men standing in a row.Duke: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThis time the Duke only lasted 3 minutes. While pinned to the ground by a knife, he slowly convulsed to his death.The system\u2019s voice again sounded. They each gained another set of points.And then\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The Duke was alive again.This time the three of them stood there in silence for a few seconds. They then handed a knife to a more courageous examinee, gave them some instructions and stepped aside.\u2026\u2026\u2026.One hour.One full hour.The Duke refreshed eight times during that time. The examinees didn\u2019t fight and took turns.They basically took on a \u2018progress together, prosper together\u2019 attitude.After those eight times, all the examinees present had gained a satisfactory amount of points.***At the top of Carlton Mountain, a small cabin with a pointed roof stood alone in the night.The cabin consisted of two floors; the ground floor and a basement.Carrying an oil lamp, 154 emerged from the basement and said to the other two: \u201cIt\u2019s late. You two don\u2019t plan on sleeping?\u201d021 crossed her long legs: \u201cIs the basement flooded yet?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. There was some water in one of the confinement rooms, but I\u2019ve cleaned it up.\u201d 154 said.922 laid on the floor shaking his leg: \u201cHaa\u2026\u2026..\u201d154 asked with annoyance: \u201cWhat are you sighing for? You\u2019ve already sighed ten times tonight.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d 922 continued to shake his leg, \u201cdon\u2019t you think this exam has been particularly quiet? I\u2019m used to the confinement room constantly being used now. Boss and A\u2026\u2026.ah, that person shouldn\u2019t be like this. I can\u2019t even sleep.\u201dHe almost let slip but fortunately he reacted quickly and saved it in time.021 shot him a glance: \u201cDon\u2019t you think there\u2019s a problem with your way of thinking? No one is breaking the rules yet your sighing.\u201dIn fact, 021 was also sighing inside but she had to stay in character.154 thought for a moment and said: \u201cIt\u2019s nice that it\u2019s quiet. Anyway, it\u2019s boss that\u2019s getting punished each time a rule is broken. I hope that they can quietly get through this one.\u201dAs soon as he finished saying that, the system sent a timely notice.Half a minute later, they each held a notice with a look of shock.The notice wrote:Examinees You Huo, Qin Jiu and Gao Qi led 16 examinees to score points maliciously. A total of 19 examinees have violated the rules. Invigilators, please address this immediately!922: \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d021: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe invigilators were about to go bald.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: 19 in one go \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Take them downstairs. There\u2019s not enough space for me to stand here.\u201d922 responded: \u201cMiss, do you think there\u2019s enough space downstairs? We only have three rooms. If three enter at a time, it will take a day for everyone to be done.\u201d\u201cAt a time like this there\u2019s no point giving single rooms. Put them together.\u201d 154 said.Please read this from kk translates***The basement wholeheartedly upheld the unique characteristic of the invigilator\u2019s area and remained consistent in style with the examination centre.It looked just like the underground dungeon under the church\u2014\u2014\u2014-After going down the stone steps you would be greeted with an underground tunnel. Along the semi-arced walls hung several fire torches which separated the tunnel into bright and dark blocks.At the end of the tunnel were three adjacent rooms that looked like stone prison cells. Narrow black doors stood before the three rooms.Perhaps it was done with the intention to make the rooms appear more suffocating and smaller, there was only one small source of light here in the basement. Most of the basement was only dimly lit and covered in dark shadows.021 furrowed her brows when she came down.922 muttered bluntly: \u201cOut of all the confinement rooms, I hate this kind the most.\u201d\u201cStop complaining okay? This is after I cleaned it. It was more realistic before that.\u201d 154 replied with annoyance.The examinees stood at the end of the tunnel exchanging looks with one another.A more courageous one raised his hand and asked: \u201cInvigilator, can I ask what the punishment is?\u201d\u201cAh, you don\u2019t know?\u201d 922 asked without thinking.The examinee was very confused: \u201cShould\u2026..I know?\u201dThe three invigilators froze for a moment. They suddenly realised that they had been conditioned by You Huo and Qin Jiu and had almost forgotten that normal examinees should have no knowledge about the punishments and would be a little fearful.152 cleared his throat and answered with a straight face: \u201cIn the case of first-time rule violations, violating examinees will be confined for three hours each.\u201d\u201cIs it life-threatening?\u201d\u201cGenerally, it\u2019s not.\u201d 154 said.Generally?Several of the timider examinees almost broke down.154 hesitated and added: \u201cYou will see your most feared scenes, person or thing in the confinement room. As long as you keep that in mind, it won\u2019t be life-threatening.\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, his small red light beeped again.His first thought in response to this was that the system tonight was being very strict. It was acting a little harsher than usual.But when he opened the first confinement room door and secretly felt glad that the danger may be reduced with more people present, he suddenly realised\u2026\u2026.It wasn\u2019t that the system was being particularly strict, it was him. At some unknown point in time, he had started becoming more biased towards the examinees.In other words, their position as an invigilator had become more and more obviously biased towards the examinees. At times, it wasn\u2019t very well concealed.They became more and more unruly.In the past, he would immediately become more cautious whenever the red warning light goes off.But now, the warning light had turned on twice and he didn\u2019t even glance at it.Not only him, it was the same for 922 and 021.It was probably due to the influence of those two.\u201cWhat are you standing around for?\u201d 922 suddenly patted him, \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d154 returned to his senses: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d922 shot him another glance before turning around to organise the examinees.Perhaps it was because he wanted to covertly reduce the danger and risks, this idiot tried to shove all 19 of them into the same confinement room. With more people, the terrifying scenes that may appear would likely mix together and no longer feel scary.What\u2019s more, with companions beside them, they could also help each other out.But as he tried to shove the sixth one in, the system suddenly spoke up.Although its voice had no undulations, it was clear that it had held itself back for a long time and was not in a good mood.\u3010Warning. The maximum capacity of a confinement room is 5 people. Room capacity exceeded.\u3011922 said: \u201cWith three rooms, only 15 can be done. What about the other four?\u201d\u3010Remaining examinees should wait patiently on the bench outside the confinement rooms. No ruckus should be made.\u3011922: \u201cOh\u2026..\u201dHe then tried to put Qin Jiu, You Huo and Gao Qi into the three separate rooms. With those three taking the lead, the confinement rooms shouldn\u2019t be a problem.But unexpectedly, the system again spoke up.\u3010Examinees Pang An, Meng Cenchen, Li Hao, Zhang Rui and Xu Xinxin enter the second confinement room.\u3011922: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dGreat. It\u2019s now doing a rollcall.This wasn\u2019t a party; this was a bank.The system again called out another five names and directed them to enter the third confinement room. It then said:\u3010Examinees Qin Jiu, You Huo, Gao Qi and Zhao Hong, please wait outside.\u3011Hearing this, 922 finally frowned.Even a fool like him could tell that the system held bad intentions.According to his understanding, this examinee called Zhao Hong was also someone who performed rather well. Besides those other three, he was the one who had scored the most points in this exam.To put those four together into a batch, the system\u2019s intention was too obvious\u2014\u2014-Firstly, it avoided the possibility of making the confinement rooms too easy.Secondly, those people could return to continue the exam after three hours whereas they would need to wait six hours.It had removed them from the exam under the guise of punishment.Please read this from kk translatesWith those four not around, who knows what the resurrected Duke would do?If he could reach this conclusion, his boss naturally would too.922 shoved the last group of examinees into the confinement room and turned to glance at Qin Jiu only to find the other party pinching his nose looking uncomfortable.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong boss?\u201d He and 154 came over.Qin Jiu had already lowered his hand. He looked the same as usual: \u201cWhat what\u2019s wrong?\u201d922 for a moment thought he saw wrong.They didn\u2019t probe further and went back upstairs after bidding goodbye.There were several benches outside the confinement rooms. Although they were referred to as benches, they\u2019re actually stone slabs.The examinee Zhao Hong was still immersed in the excitement of having scored points and was too excited to sit down.After pacing back and forth a few times, he wanted to say \u201cCome great masters! Let\u2019s discuss what to do next.\u201d but great master number 1 threw out a sentence \u201cSleepy. Going to sleep.\u201dYou Huo then casually found a \u201cbench\u201d in the corner, laid down and soon fell asleep whilst using his arms as a pillow.Zhao Hong then looked over at Qin Jiu.He sat down on a stone slab next to You Huo and said: \u201cI\u2019ll rest a little too.\u201dAfter that was silence.Gao Qi watched him and muttered with confusion: \u201cIt\u2019s understandable that A is a little sleepy but why are you coming here too?\u201dQin Jiu had already closed his eyes. He answered lazily without opening his eyes: \u201cProbably got infected by him.\u201dGao Qi snorted. He thought: Are you trying to show off again?Zhao Hong then looked over at Gao Qi. Gao Qi pointed at a stone slab and suggested: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we also take a nap?\u201dZhao Hong: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dAre you coming to the invigilator\u2019s area to catch up on sleep?Gao Qi meant it when he suggested that. Very soon, soft snoring could be heard in the basement.As Zhao Hong laid on one of the stone slabs, he could faintly hear screams coming from the confinement rooms. Although it wasn\u2019t blood-curdling screams, it did contain fear and shock.He listened to this for a while and could no longer sleep. He simply laid there in thought with his eyes open.Qin Jiu and You Huo sat very close to Zhao Hong. His eyes moved and inadvertently travelled across to those two.Perhaps it may just be due to the dim lights, Qin Jiu slept with his brows slightly furrowed and there was a small trace of fatigue on his face.Zhao Hong wasn\u2019t very familiar with them. His only impression was: Super powerful.He subconsciously thought: They can also get tired?But he then thought about it and felt that this thought of his was very strange. How could one not be tired?Just as he was about to continue with his daydreams, his line of sight travelled past You Huo and abruptly stopped when he noticed his arm.There was a large red patch on his wrist.Zhao Hong took a closer look. It was a wound.A large, bloody flesh wound.It was very strange.That wound wasn\u2019t there ten minutes ago when You Huo laid down.Zhao Hong was shocked for a moment before suddenly realising\u2014\u2014The disease from the church had started to take effect\u2026\u2026\u2026..***You Huo knew that he had a fever. All his muscles and joints were sore.Perhaps it was because he was a little tired, he didn\u2019t sleep very well. Once again, he had one of his rare fragmented dreams.He again dreamt of that familiar house.He again dreamt of that basement.In the dream, his surroundings were dim just like the invigilators area they were currently in. Only a single corridor light was on.He came out from the confinement room and used the back of his hand to close the door behind him.For some reason, the ends of his hair and neck were a little damp.\u2026\u2026\u2026..But his shirt was still neat and meticulous. He just had the sleeves rolled up a little to his elbows.He followed the stairs and headed upstairs, grabbed a clean set of clothes from the sofa in the living room and turned into the bathroom on the first floor.Before he could take more than a few steps, a voice suddenly sounded.In reality, this voice annoyed him. It was even more so in the dream.\u3010Invigilator A, why are you taking a shower after coming out of the confinement room?\u3011You Huo frowned. He returned to his usual cold look.\u201cIs it interesting watching me 24 hours a day?\u201dThe system\u2019s voice again sounded:\u3010This is my responsibility and something that is within my ability. Most importantly, it complies with the rules.\u3011There was a slight difference between the system here and the system in the examination centres. It spoke more like a human here.The You Huo in the dream didn\u2019t speak. He just focused on retrieving a towel from the drawer.The system didn\u2019t relent:\u3010You still haven\u2019t answered. Why are you taking a shower after coming out of the confinement room?\u3011You Huo\u2019s movements stopped. After a pause, he answered indifferently: \u201cBecause it\u2019s humid.\u201dThe system no longer spoke. Several seconds later, it added:\u3010But according to the records, the temperature didn\u2019t increase 15 days ago. You did the same that day too.\u3011You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dYou Huo threw his clothes onto the vanity. He supported himself with it in silence for a moment and said: \u201cLike I said, it\u2019s because it\u2019s humid. When do you plan to move the confinement room above ground?\u201dSystem:\u3010Not moving. The comfort level of the confinement room determines the punishment severity. It will never be moved.\u3011Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Now why did he take a shower??

According to my database, examinees like these have a tendency to search for loopholes and take advantage of it. To put it more simply, they\u2019re crafty and sly.\u3011You Huo didn\u2019t even look up. He treated the speaker as if it didn\u2019t exist.He would often ignore the sound that would appear in his house from time to time and would only very occasionally utter a few words when required or when annoyed.For the remainder of that time, he would treat the other party as air and go about normally with his life.If the other party was a human, it would probably explode with rage from this kind of cold treatment.Unfortunately, the other party wasn\u2019t.No matter how similar it was, it wasn\u2019t.And so, the system just took You Huo\u2019s cold treatment for granted and was able to continue speaking for a long time without receiving a response.\u3010The number of violations made by this examinee is much more than the combined total of violations made by the rest of the examinees in the same examination centre. As of now, he has violated the rules 9 times. According to my analysis, this kind of behaviour isn\u2019t just craftiness, it\u2019s complete conceitedness.\u3011\u3010Conceited.\u3011\u3010Dangerous.\u3011\u3010Arrogant.\u3011\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..The system threw out word after word of insults directed at the examinee.According to its initial settings, the system should only be responsible for initial assessment and it was the responsibility of invigilators to comment on such matters.Even after the system gradually lost control and expanded its scope of control, it would rarely single out an examinee and evaluate them like this.Just the use of one or two adjectives was rare. For the system to give out three adjectives, it could be said that the examinee had struck gold.And for this examinee, it was as if the floodgates holding the system back was gone. Words were constantly thrown out one after another.\u2026\u2026.\u3010Haughty.\u3011\u3010Lazy.\u3011Those who didn\u2019t know what it was doing would have thought that it was going through a dictionary.You Huo finally interrupted. \u201cYou done?\u201d\u3010No.\u3011You Huo threw his phone onto the vanity, \u201cThen make it a yes.\u201d\u3010Are you taking the examinee\u2019s side?\u3011\u201cYou\u2019re thinking too much.\u201d You Huo\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. He continued coldly, \u201cYou\u2019re just too noisy.\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesThe system then said confidently:\u3010According to data analysis and personality matching, the probability of you and that examinee getting into physical altercation is 52.11%, the probably of verbal argument is 46.32%, the probability of getting along peacefully is 1.16%, the probability of having a pleasant conversation is 0.403333% and the probability of becoming friends is 0.\u3011\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe You Huo in the dream was left speechless for a moment. He could neither cry nor laugh.He didn\u2019t know if it was because of the system, because of the system\u2019s nonsense talk or because\u2026.of its description of the examinee.Everything in the dream was a little unclear, particularly his state of mind.Not only You Huo himself, the system also wasn\u2019t clear.It is everywhere and can see and hear almost everything, but it\u2019s understanding of emotions was still very poor.After reporting those statistics out, it said firmly:\u3010Just from this, the likelihood of you taking his side is very small. If humans tried to calculate this, this information would definitely be overlooked, and they would directly consider it impossible. I however won\u2019t do that.\u3011\u3010There is still a 0.00666\u2026\u2026..67% possibility of you and that examinee becoming friends.\u3011\u3010But that small probability does not have the necessary conditions to allow it to happen.\u3011\u3010That examinee has re-done his last exam several times and will soon come to a realisation that his efforts are pointless. After this confinement session, he should reflect on himself a little. As long as he manages to stay within the rule boundaries next time, he can leave.\u3011Hearing the word \u201cleave\u201d, You Huo finally showed a reaction.His thin eyelids lifted slightly before falling back down again.His expression remained calm, but his fingers moved to turn on the faucet.Water gushed out into the sink while he was a little lost in thought.\u3010Aren\u2019t you going to take a shower? Washing your hand before showering is a waste of resources.\u3011You Huo froze for a moment.He didn\u2019t want the system to notice that he was distracted and expressionlessly brought some water up to splash his face before turning the faucet off.Contrary to the temperature on a hot summer\u2019s night, the water was very cold. The wrist of the hand that touched the water was wet, and even a little painful.That short period of pain almost pulled You Huo out of his dream state, leaving him in a half-asleep half-awake state.On one end, he was that person supporting himself with the vanity. On the other end, he was someone standing on the side watching his past self.Strangely enough, as an onlooker he didn\u2019t know who the person in the confinement room was and he also didn\u2019t know who the person the system said would leave was.But for some reason, the he in the dream felt a little complicated.He was disappointed, but also relieved.The system emphasised again:\u3010If he performs normally, the probability of passing the exam is very high.\u3011The You Huo in the dream dried his hands.He still remembered those examinees who had been converted into NPCs. Perhaps Zhao Wentu had left him with a deep impression.And so, he asked: \u201cYou will really let him go?\u201dThe answer was something he both expected and didn\u2019t expect.The system didn\u2019t answer directly. It thought for a moment and said:\u3010Overly dangerous people should not be directly released. I will deal with them in accordance to the relevant rules and regulations.\u3011You Huo frowned slightly. He replaced the towel he was using to try his hands back onto the vanity.\u3010Also, you went to the control centre twice this week. It is once more than the specified number of times.\u3011You Huo ignored the system and entered the shower. Very soon, the sound of water flowing could be heard.This was not his first time, so the system didn\u2019t continue pursuing. For once, it was considerate enough to stop blabbering.According to its data, humans are most relaxed when bathing and their five senses will be significantly weakened. Even if it spoke, he probably wouldn\u2019t be listening.A long time later, You Huo dried his hair, changed into a new set of clothes and headed downstairs with a glass of water.The system spoke again:\u3010You have been entering the basement more frequently each day compared to before.\u3011You Huo stopped: \u201cIf you really want to kill examinees from thirst, go and let them do that at the examination centre. Don\u2019t let them die at my place.\u201dThe system obediently shut its mouth.Carrying a cold invigilator\u2019s expression, You Huo entered the confinement room.After turning around and lowering his head to lock the door, a figure suddenly appeared beside him.That person lightly grabbed You Huo\u2019s wrist, twisted it behind his waist and took the glass he held with his other hand.\u201cYou won\u2019t get a second one if you spill it.\u201d You Huo turned his head and said to the person behind him.Despite being restrained like this, he wasn\u2019t angry.Perhaps it was because the other party didn\u2019t use any force and had only done it as if he was joking.He couldn\u2019t see the face of the person behind him, but he could tell from that person\u2019s posture that he was lazily drinking the water.You Huo saw through the corner of his eyes the other person\u2019s raised arm with their sleeve loosely rolled up. The other person\u2019s atmosphere completely enveloped him, and it carried a feeling of oppressiveness that wasn\u2019t unpleasant.Please read this from kk translatesIn the dream, that atmosphere was somehow very familiar.You Huo was then woken up by this sense of familiarity.Next to him were hurried footsteps as well as quiet discussions. It sounded like there were quite a few people around and they were anxious about something.The moment his consciousness cleared, the scene in the dream faded and he was only left with a faint impression\u2026.For example, the wrist that was restrained, and side of his waist that it was pressed\u2026\u2026It hurt a little?In his still muddled state, You Huo was a little puzzled.As his mind gradually cleared up, those two areas started to become more and more painful.This great master finally realised that something wasn\u2019t right.He furrowed his brows and heard Gao Qi\u2019s voice: \u201cHey, hey, hey, he moved! Is he waking up? Any water? Young lady, don\u2019t be stingy. Seeing that we\u2019re practically colleagues, can\u2019t you give us two glasses of water?\u201dMiss 021\u2019s voice soon followed: \u201cMedicine too.\u201d\u201cYes, and some fever medicine. You can just keep it on my tab. If it\u2019s not enough, you can deduct it from my card. Two glasses of water and two fever medicine. Just deduct from it according to the standard price at the rest stops.\u201dBefore 021 was able to speak, 922\u2019s voice rang: \u201c154! I found the bandages! But there\u2019s not much\u2026I don\u2019t know if its enough for them both. I knew I should\u2019ve brought two less boxes of meat.\u201d154: \u201cWhat did I say before we came? Didn\u2019t I tell you to bring more useful things? You only know to eat.\u201dYou Huo finally half opened his eyes. He could vaguely see 922 standing in front of 154 with his hands clapped together: \u201cI was wrong, I was wrong. I didn\u2019t think it would be so bad this time. I will definitely reduce two boxes next time.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d You Huo asked.It was only after speaking that he noticed that his throat was both dry and sore. It felt like it was rubbed by sandpaper and all his joints ached.He tried to sit up, but Gao Qi flew over: \u201cDon\u2019t move! Please, just stay like that. Don\u2019t move.\u201dIn a place outside of everyone\u2019s line of sight, 021 chewed on her bottom lip. Her worried eyes met with You Huo\u2019s.Gao Qi asked worriedly: \u201cAre you cold?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s summer\u2026\u2026.\u201d You Huo said with annoyance. His voice was still hoarse.\u201cHere, drink some water first. I got this from 021. I\u2019ll get more if it\u2019s not enough.\u201dYou Huo reached out to receive it but his movements suddenly stopped.He finally knew why his wrist was hurting more and more. It was because a large chunk of the flesh there was missing.It was different from ordinary injuries. Blood wasn\u2019t gushing outwards in large flows and was just slowly trickling out. It was bright red and sticky, and you could almost see his bone underneath.If it wasn\u2019t on his body, he would have even doubted that the arm belonged to a living human.Gao Qi sucked in a breath: \u201cYou\u2026..Are you in a lot of pain?\u201dYou Huo froze for a moment and said: \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dBut it was indeed an ugly sight.\u201cYou should mentally prepare yourself. It\u2019s probably\u2026\u2026..the effect of the curse starting.\u201d Gao Qi explained, \u201cWe wanted to apply some medicine and treat the wound but\u2026\u2026.it\u2019s not a normal wound.\u201dWhen they first saw it, that area was only missing some skin and was at most the width of two coins in size.In less than half an hour, it had spread into something that was almost half the size of a palm, and particularly deep.Just from its appearance, it was obvious that the wound that was just \u201cokay\u201d should be painful enough for one to cry in agony.Gao Qi said: \u201cYou have a fever right now. Can you feel it? I think this wound is only going to get more and more serious. We had a discussion just now; this probably has something to do with the Duke.\u201dFrom what they had heard from the townspeople, it usually took some time for the curse to spread.That townsman had said that he initially started with a fever before getting sores and wounds on his skin a few days later but how long had it been for You Huo?\u201cEvery time the Duke is resurrected, the curse is activated. After killing him so many times\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe curse had increased by almost tenfold.Gao Qi said: \u201cAlthough it might not help much, you should take some fever medicine\u2014\u2014Huh?\u201dHalfway through his words, You Huo suddenly stood up.Under the complex gazes of 021, Gao Qi and 922, he immediately walked over to Qin Jiu\u2019s side, \u201cHow many injuries does he have?

His voice was still low, \u201cAccording to 1006, his wounds appeared after yours so he will probably wake up a little later.\u201d154 only now returned to his senses. He soaked the medicine in the water and said, \u201cAs for how many there are, we don\u2019t know. We haven\u2019t checked.\u201dQin Jiu\u2019s hand rested beside him. His palms were a terrible sight, almost comparable to that of You Huo\u2019s.It was clearly similar with a mixture of blood, flesh and bones peeking out from underneath but You Huo felt that Qin Jiu\u2019s wounds looked more horrific.Perhaps it was because it was on someone else, so it looked worse.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you check?\u201d He asked 154.\u201cWhen asleep, boss doesn\u2019t like others\u2014\u2014\u2013huh?\u201d 154 was halfway through his explanation when You Huo reached out for Qin Jiu\u2019s collar.Qin Jiu who was still suffering from his fever furrowed his brows when he felt this.His mask had been removed and left to one side. Under the dim underground lighting, his lips and face were colourless.Normally, he would be lazy and arrogant. Sturdy and reliable, it was as if he would never be tired or sick.This sickly and fatigued appearance of his was rare, and it looked extremely serious.You Huo\u2019s fingers paused. He lightened his movements.Just as he was about to continue, his wrist was grabbed.922 sucked in a breath.Fortunately, You Huo wasn\u2019t using his injured hand. If Qin Jiu had grabbed onto that wound with that amount of force\u2026\u2026\u2026.Ugh\u2014\u2014\u2013He couldn\u2019t help but shudder.922 rubbed his arms.154 sighed and finished his words, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like others touching him. There\u2019s an 80-90% chance of being attacked.\u201dJust as he finished saying that, Qin Jiu woke up.With half-opened eyes, his eyes that were heavy with sleep fell onto You Huo\u2019s face.His fever made it difficult to tell whether it was dream or reality.Qin Jiu soon closed his eyes again. The tension in his handsome brows were not gone, but it was no longer furrowed as tightly as before.He reduced his strength on You Huo\u2019s hand but didn\u2019t let go. As he closed his eyes, he gently used his thumb to rub You Huo\u2019s wrist a few times.It was a very small and natural action that carried an almost intimate and reassuring meaning.The others didn\u2019t notice it; only You Huo felt it.He curled his fingers slightly.He clearly could just move away but it was as if he was suddenly hit with a bout of laziness and he didn\u2019t retract his hand.After being in daze for another two seconds, Qin Jiu again opened his eyes.This time he was completely awake. His eyes once again fell onto You Huo\u2019s face before sweeping over to the others around him. He then sat up and retracted his hand.Please read this from kk translatesAfter the temperature around his wrist was suddenly withdrawn, You Huo moved his hand back and flexed his joints.\u201cNumb?\u201d Qin Jiu\u2019s voice was hoarse and rough, \u201cI\u2019m a little alert when sleeping. Did I hurt you?\u201dThose actions earlier were clearly something he had done unintentionally. He no longer remembered it.You Huo shook his head, \u201cJust grabbed it. Didn\u2019t use force.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your hand?\u201d Qin Jiu\u2019s eyes fell onto his other wrist. His eyebrows furrowed again.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026You should look at your own hand first.\u201d922 knocked his head onto 154\u2019s shoulder. He couldn\u2019t help but lament: \u201cMy god. I\u2019m can\u2019t believe this\u2026\u2026.\u201d154 had an intolerable expression. He didn\u2019t know if it was because of the wounds, or because of the two people themselves.You can already see the damn bones, yet your attention is on the other person. Is this because you lost sensation there or because you have a big heart?Perhaps it\u2019s because amazing people like them are different from others.Examinee Zhao Hong who was mingled in with the group of invigilators couldn\u2019t help but think: I probably won\u2019t be a great master like them in this lifetime no matter what I do.After a brief explanation, Qin Jiu understood the current situation: \u201cSo the method of killing the Duke is wrong.\u201dGao Qi: \u201c\u2026\u2026.We said all that because we wanted you to understand how serious that curse is. You two are in danger now. Life-threatening danger, do you understand? If you are not careful, the two of you will end up in that church calling those bloodied humans brothers! Who has the time to discuss the method of killing the Duke?!\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dGao Qi: \u201cUnderstand my ass!\u201dQin Jiu looked at him with a raised eyebrow.Gao Qi looked back at him challengingly for a few seconds before suddenly rubbing his face. Fuck, what happened to me. I\u2019m now treating 001 as a brother rather than an old adversary.With his face covered, he muttered a few things about A being the one at fault and how he was probably affected by the ridiculous idea that a friend of a friend is a friend.Gao Qi turned around and glared at You Huo.You Huo and Qin Jiu sat on the same bench. Under the collective urging from 922 and 154, and 021\u2019s silent stare\u2026\u2026..You Huo refused to take the medicine.154 had his hand out. In it were several kinds of medications including fever medications, anti-inflammatory medications and medications for pain relief.Miss 021 changed her attitude as quickly as one would turn over a page in a book; a moment ago she refused to give medicine but the moment she saw You Huo\u2019s waist also bleeding, she rushed upstairs to grab the first aid kit.\u201cOne is enough.\u201d You Huo said and nudged Qin Jiu, \u201cDeal with your people first.\u201dJust that one phrase of his gave Gao Qi mixed feelings.Several years ago, when You Huo was still wearing the invigilator\u2019s uniform, he would often throw out the line \u201cdeal with your people first\u201d to Qin Jiu.And Qin Jiu would always reply, \u201cMy people? Sure. When I discipline them next time, I\u2019ll invite Big Invigilator over to give me some feedback. How does that sound?\u201dThe locations would always be at the meeting room, control centre, corridor, punishment building etc. The atmosphere between them was always filled with tension. A\u2019s expression was always cold and 001\u2019s tone would always be provocative.It had become a routine at the invigilator\u2019s place.Unexpectedly, after so many years, the same words were spoken by the same person but in a completely different context.Qin Jiu took in You Huo\u2019s bloody hand and continued to furrow his brows. He then said to 154: \u201cOne is definitely not enough.\u201dYou Huo on the other hand pointed over and said to 154: \u201cGive it to him.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dBefore 154 was able to speak, 021 couldn\u2019t hold herself back.The young lady rolled her eyes and poured out two piles of medicine, \u201cHere, here, here. Is this okay now? You\u2019re both acting like we\u2019re forcefully feeding you poison. This examinee earlier allowed me to appreciate the beauty of the NPCs at the church and they were almost completely rotten. For the sake of not becoming like those NPCs, can you throw away that male self-esteem of yours and admit that it you\u2019re sick and in pain?\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesShe tossed the two piles of medicine into two glasses and forced it into their hands: \u201cDrink!\u201d****You Huo and Qin Jiu couldn\u2019t argue against this young lady. Maintaining their gentlemanly attitude, they reluctantly took the medicine and wrapped their wounds up.The effectiveness wasn\u2019t obvious, but it was better than nothing.Under the effect of the medicine, the two slept again.Three hours passed very quickly. When the door to the confinement rooms finally opened, the first batch of examinees ran out crying and howling with faces covered in snot and tears.Fortunately, they were only rendered miserable, and no one was hurt.The remaining four were easier to accommodate.Taking into consideration You Huo and Qin Jiu\u2019s condition, 922 wanted to put the two together so that they could help each other out.During those three hours, who knows whether the wounds would continue to spread.But the system once again spoke out with bad intentions.Its goal this time was clear. Without too much nonsense, it directly assigned them to the following confinement rooms:Qin Jiu in room one.Gao Qi in room two.Examinee Zhao Hong in room 3.That was it.Two could clearly be confined together but the system didn\u2019t allow it.You Huo was once again excluded and was forced to be in the third batch.After Qin Jiu entered the confinement room, 922 and 154 left the basement.Like the other confinement rooms, there was also a room in the cabin with three screens connected to the three confinement rooms that is referred to as the monitoring room.Under the influence of their boss, there was no such thing as monitoring the examinees in 922 and 154\u2019s dictionaries.This was their first time using the monitoring room. It was mainly because they were worried about Qin Jiu who confined in there alone.The screen very quickly turned on. The two of them pulled up a chair and sat down before the screen with a serious expression\u2026..They had no interest in examinees private matters so watching them through the monitoring screens was a long and boring task. As for monitoring Qin Jiu\u2026\u2026.Other rule violators\u2019 would at least be a little stimulating. His was just an unchanging ruin site.922 watched on for a while and couldn\u2019t help but start chatting with 154.\u201cWhere is this ruin site?\u201d 922 asked curiously, \u201cI don\u2019t seem to have seen it before.\u201d154: \u201cIt\u2019s not a place one would go to normally so it\u2019s normal for you not to have seen it.\u201d\u201cNot a place one would normally go to? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cUnder normal circumstances, it\u2019s a place even invigilators cannot enter.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d922 nodded as if in understanding.On the screen, the other two confinement rooms were very lively. In contrast, Qin Jiu\u2019s screen was very quiet and it had\u2026\u2026..a small sense of loneliness.922 supported his chin in daze for a moment and suddenly realised something: \u201cHey\u2014\u2014\u2014-That\u2019s not right. If it\u2019s a place invigilators normally can\u2019t enter, why would you know about it 154?\u201d***The group of people who had completed their punishment were sent back to the examination centre by 021.At the foot of Carlton mountain, 021 stopped and pointed at a metal fence surrounded by overgrown weeds, \u201cGo forward for ten metres and there\u2019s a gap in the fence. From there, you will see the castle.\u201dWith the shock from the confinement room punishment yet to fade, the examinees slowly trudged back.Each and every one of them had a look of exhaustion. No one spoke.They quietly went through the fence and walked into the castle\u2019s dark shadow like they were entering a beast\u2019s mouth.\u201cLet\u2019s hurry. There are still a few ladies in the castle.\u201d Someone finally returned to their senses and hastened their steps.With this reminder, everyone else similarly returned to their senses.\u201cFuck, I almost forgot! How many were there? Four? Five?\u201d\u201cRegardless, that Duke is no better than a beast. Who knows what he would do!\u201dIf it was before, they would be too afraid to return to the examination centre.But now it was different.Every one of them had killed the Duke.Although the other party could come back to life, it didn\u2019t matter. They had overcome the fear in their hearts.They raced back to the castle and was attacked by the thick stench of blood the moment they entered through the door.\u201cWhat happened\u2026\u2026..?\u201dThe smell of blood was most intense on the second floor. Zhao Jiatong was standing in a room wielding a knife.The large dress that constantly got in her way had been removed and she had changed into her own clothes. Her expression was dark and sombre.The battle earlier had been too chaotic, and she had overlooked a few people.It was to the point that\u2026\u2026..When the Duke wandered through the castle, she was only able to protect the ones she had accounted for.This room was one of ones she had missed.In here lived a very shy girl with dimples in the corner of her mouth. When she smiled, her smiles were very sweet.Zhao Jiatong had not spoken to her before, but she remembered her smile.At this moment, that face had been left on the bed by the Duke. Pale and bloody, she could no longer smile\u2026\u2026.As the Duke moved away from the bed, he shook his head and licked off the blood from his fingers. He sighed, \u201cIt failed again\u2026\u2026.Pitiful lady, sleep and have a good dream.\u201dZhao Jiatong raised her knife and rushed in for the kill.She single-handedly killed the Duke a total of five times.And in a place unbeknownst to her, Qin Jiu who was sitting in the ruins raised his thin and slender hand up against the sun. It was white and bony.As he flexed his fingers, his bones softly cracked.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Some subtle (or not so subtle) dog food hereOn a small note, I personally don\u2019t really like the official synopsis/description of this novel because it doesn\u2019t reveal much but I\u2019m also horrible at writing one because I just know I will somehow include spoilers\u2026..Would anyone like to give ideas or suggestions??Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Global University Entrance ExaminationChapter 90Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDon\u2019t Close Your Eyes At MeChapter 90: Torturing out a ConfessionWatching your body slowly rot was a very unnerving thing.The skin and flesh would melt, revealing the white bones underneath\u2026\u2026The entire process was like you were watching something die in slow motion. Every second and every detail were clearly shown to amplify the torture and suffering.But Qin Jiu was fine.He was far from being unnerved, and just felt a little regretful.Perhaps it was because the entire process was too magical, it didn\u2019t feel realistic.Or perhaps it was because he was just too confident.He sat in his usual spot in the ruins the entire time with his jacket lying beside him. The white silk shirt he wore was stained with blood.He bent one of his legs and examined the bones on his hand as he waited patiently.When the blood on him was too excessive, only then did he open the roll of bandages 922 had forced onto him.He wasn\u2019t interested in appreciating the flesh wound so he didn\u2019t take off his shirt. Instead, he directly wrapped the bandages around his shirt.When 021 entered the monitoring room, she was met with this scene.She frowned and asked, \u201cWhy is he wrapping it like that? Don\u2019t tell me Invigilator 001 doesn\u2019t know how to treat a wound. What kind of joke is this?\u201d922: \u201cHow could that be?\u201d\u201cThen what is he doing?\u201d\u201cCovering blood, I guess.\u201d021 was stunned, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cCovering blood, not stopping blood.\u201d 154 said.Sure enough, the Qin Jiu in the monitoring screen proceeded to wrap another layer of the bandages around his shirt and then around his finger\u2026\u2026..uh, finger bones.Blood once again stained the new layer of bandages, but it didn\u2019t penetrate through as deeply as before. In other words, the blood was no longer that obvious.He rested his arm against his knee and looked into the distance in thought.When the end of the confinement period was about to be reached, he stood up and straightened his shirt. Apart from slight sluggishness in his actions initially, one could hardly tell that there was a problem. It was as if his injury was only affected his hand.Only someone with extremely strong willpower was able to do this\u2026\u2026.But was this really necessary?Did he really have to be so stubborn and hide all his weaknesses?021 who saw this couldn\u2019t help but mutter this internally.In the screen, Qin Jiu interlaced his fingers to adjust his gloves and then raised his head and looked around.He appeared to be looking for something.Soon, his eyes stopped moving and happened to meet with 021\u2019s eyes across the screen.\u201c\u2026\u2026..He\u2019s not looking at us right? A coincidence?\u201d 021 pointed at the screen.\u201cMm. \u201cSaid 154, \u201cHe probably is.\u201d\u201cAre you serious? He can tell where the surveillance cameras are?\u201d 021 asked incredulously, \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d922 nodded: \u201cIt\u2019s true. When he was at the invigilator\u2019s area, he could always point out the location of the system\u2026..\u201d154 thought about it and added: \u201cHe really, really hates being bounded and controlled. He hates it more than most people so he has always been a little more sensitive\u2026\u2026..\u201dAs they spoke, Qin Jiu actually gestured something to the screen. He indicated for the invigilators to come and then made a \u201cshh\u201d gesture.021: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dAfter thinking about it, she quietly went down to the basement.You Huo was still asleep. Remembering Qin Jiu gesture, she quietly walked around him and opened the door to the confinement room.Qin Jiu was standing next to the door. He lowered his voice and said: \u201cI entered a few minutes earlier than the others. To be fair, shouldn\u2019t I be able to go out first?\u201d021 frowned: \u201cYou\u2014\u2013\u201dQin Jiu again pressed a finger to his lips.021 glanced at You Huo and whispered: \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dQin Jiu raised an eyebrow and just asked: \u201cCan I or can I not?\u201d021 stared at him. A moment later, she understood.He wanted to leave first so that he could return and do something in advance. Perhaps it was something crazy and a little risky, so he wanted to avoid the others\u2026\u2026No, most people wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with him, nor could they work together with him.Please read this from kk translatesThere was only one person he wanted to avoid.021 looked at Qin Jiu.This man was obviously sick and pale, but he still maintained strong vitality.She was suddenly at a loss.Because of all the past events and the rumours she had heard, she really didn\u2019t like this top ranking invigilator. However, after interacting with him over the past two exams, Qin Jiu had always surprised her\u2026\u2026..She suddenly started to doubt herself.A few minutes later, for the first time in her life, 021 agreed with Qin Jiu\u2019s request and allowed him to be released a little earlier than the others.***In the castle, the thick smell of blood filled the air.There were dead examines, the Duke himself and also dark shadows on the wall.After several kills, Zhao Jiatong finally realised that the shadows didn\u2019t appear randomly and would only appear when the Duke was at his weakest.She had killed the Duke five times, and those shadows had also appeared five times. They were like ghosts that could never be put to rest.It wasn\u2019t until the first batch of examinees returned and she received the news that You Huo and Qin Jiu was suffering from the curse that Zhao Jiatong was able to return to her senses.Stopped in the corner by the others, she gasped for air while watching the Duke come back to life again and wander back downstairs with his cloak fluttering behind him.\u201cCan\u2019t be killed, can\u2019t be burned and can reassemble even after splitting him apart\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhao Jiatong frowned, \u201cHow on earth do we kill him?\u201dAnd more importantly, how should they do it without activating the curse?As for what You Huo and Qin Jiu\u2019s state was like, she didn\u2019t dare imagine. Just the thought of it was unbearable. She didn\u2019t want to see the two of them become ghosts and be trapped in the dark church forever.\u201cEven if we think of something, we don\u2019t dare try it.\u201d One person hit the nail in the head.\u201cYeah, we can\u2019t try it. If we try it, the two might worsen faster.\u201d\u201cNot only that, we\u2019ve also ate and drank which is equivalent to agreeing to sacrificing ourselves. This curse will definitely affect us sooner or later.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Another person wondered, \u201cWe all ate but why are we fine?\u201d\u201cHow much did you eat and how much did the they eat? I think it might be because the Duke was resurrected to many times in one night and the curse was transferred too quickly. Those two were selected firstly because they ate more, secondly because they\u2019re the most powerful and thirdly because they were the first to kill the Duke.\u201d\u201cSpeaking of which\u2026\u2026.I noticed that they didn\u2019t deliberately eat less during dinner. Did they do it to attract the curse?\u201dEveryone\u2019s expressions were heavy and complicated.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I remembered correctly, how long is this exam? I don\u2019t seem recall it being mentioned.\u201d Someone suddenly asked.Zhao Jiatong said in a quiet voice: \u201cNo, the exam didn\u2019t give us the exact duration. I am certain.\u201dEveryone fell silent. Someone then asked: \u201cThen that means it won\u2019t be enough just surviving until the time limit? How do we get out?\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Someone spoke up, \u201cSince the Duke cannot be killed, we can only kill the sick.\u201dThere are only two ways to get rid of the curse\u2014\u2014\u2014Kill the Duke so that everything returns to how it was in the beginning.Or kill all the patients and let them be relieved from their pain.The second option was something they had always been trying to avoid but now it seems that it cannot be avoided.Several examinees gritted their teeth and got ready to head to town.But they were then stopped by Zhao Jiatong: \u201cAll the sick\u2026\u2026.then does that include the newly cursed too?\u201dThose examinees instantly stopped.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026How did the examinees before us pass this exam?\u201d\u201cMaybe someone was ruthless, maybe no one had been able to pass this exam. We still don\u2019t know how true those NPCs words are\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAnyway, I can\u2019t do it.\u201dAt least, not yet.Everyone was completely stuck by this problem. They struggled and struggled, but they couldn\u2019t think of a way to achieve both conditions.The Duke would always rest for a while after a kill, so he didn\u2019t go upstairs again.After who knows how long, the door to the castle was pushed open and Qin Jiu walked in.Zhao Jiatong almost immediately rushed down only to find after reaching the first floor that Yang Shu had ran down faster than her.This lady who would always speak harshly was actually quite soft inside. Hearing about the curse, she had rushed down with her medicine bag and immediately pulled out a needle when she saw Qin Jiu.But on the contrary, Mr. 001 avoided the needle. He laughed and said: \u201cSave it. I don\u2019t need it.\u201dYang Shu\u2019s eyes immediately narrowed: \u201cBullshit. Are you the doctor or am I the doctor? If I say use it, you must use it. I don\u2019t need to save it. I still have more here so the other one will get it too.\u201dMiss Yang had always been tough. She would probably be on par to 021.Qin Jiu guessed that she probably wouldn\u2019t relent if he didn\u2019t let her do what she wanted and could only reluctantly agree.Yang Shu: \u201cShow me your arm!\u201dQin Jiu didn\u2019t follow suit: \u201cForget about the arm, I\u2019m afraid of breaking off your needle. If you really have to give me an injection, give it to me here. There\u2019s at least still some normal flesh here.\u201dAs he said that, he pulled down his collar slightly.Yang Shu froze with the syringe in her hands for a moment before suddenly understanding the meaning behind his words.It was very strange. This stubborn lady\u2019s eyes had actually turned a little red.She blinked her eyes a few times and suddenly stored away the syringe. Pushing Zhao Jiatong forward, she turned around and hurried away: \u201cI should go check on Zhou Qi to see if she has woken up.\u201dZhao Jiatong was no better.She had never imagined that there would be a day that she would worry about 001. She also realised at this moment that this ranked 1 invigilator was very strong; so strong she couldn\u2019t stand it.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay. It\u2019s still tolerable.\u201d Qin Jiu interrupted: \u201cBut I might need to rest a little first. As for the other matters, we should wait for the others to return.\u201dZhao Jiatong originally wanted to say a few more things but when she heard him say that he wanted to rest, she immediately agreed: \u201cThen hurry and sleep. I won\u2019t hold you here anymore. Let\u2019s talk when everyone\u2019s here.\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesQin Jiu bid goodbye and strode upstairs.After taking a few steps, he turned around and added, \u201cI don\u2019t like people knocking on the door when I sleep so\u2026..\u201d\u201cWhen Gao Qi returns, I\u2019ll let him stay in our room first.\u201d Zhao Jiatong reassured.\u201cThanks.\u201dFive minutes later, there was a soft sound at the base of the castle.Qin Jiu stood up and glanced at the balcony above him before walking away.Before him was a dirt path. If you followed the path down and around the foot of Carlton Mountain, you could see the town under the night sky.***When You Huo was awakened by 021, the second patch of examinees had already left.He looked at the open confinement rooms and asked 021: \u201cYou gave me another dose?\u201d021 pointed at 922: \u201cAsk him.\u201dShe threw out that sentence and left with a calm look, but it looked more like she was running away. As soon as she went upstairs, she hid inside the monitoring room.922 patted his own shoulder and said: \u201cYou also have a large one here and there was a lot of blood on the floor so we\u2026\u2026gave you another injection.\u201dHe nervously gave his explanation and thought You Huo was going to get angry.But unexpectedly, the other party was only lost in thought for a while. He asked: \u201cHow long since they\u2019ve left?\u201d\u201cAbout 20 minutes.\u201dYou Huo nodded. He got up and entered the confinement room.922 similarly slipped back upstairs.If it was the usual, You Huo would do something to disgust the system after separating people so maliciously.But today was an exception\u2014\u2014-Because he had something he wanted to do alone.As he didn\u2019t know if the result would be good or bad, he didn\u2019t want to involve Qin Jiu this time.The three hours in the dark was unusually long but in the end it still passed.021 sent You Huo back to the base of the mountain and said with her usual stern expression while pointing at the metal fence: \u201cIf you go through this you will see the castle.\u201dBut You Huo instead asked: \u201cWhich way is the town?\u201d021: \u201cHuh? This way.\u201dShe pointed towards a barren grassy area in the opposite direction before realising that something wasn\u2019t right: \u201cWhy are you going to the town?\u201d\u201cTorturing out a confession.\u201dYou Huo threw out those words and disappeared into the night.After passing through the grassy field, sure enough, the town was ahead.The small church stood eerily next to the central fountain with its stained-glass windows glistening from the lights inside.You Huo ignored the discomfort in him and jumped over a wall into the backyard of the church before heading straight into the dungeon.The witchdoctor was gagged and bounded tightly by rope. He huddled fearfully in the corner of the dungeon.Both his hands had been replaced with pig\u2019s trotters, so he knew that You Huo and Qin Jiu were capable of doing anything; they didn\u2019t do it just to scare him.You Huo grabbed his collar and woke him up with a punch: \u201cHow do you kill the Duke?\u201dThe witchdoctor subconsciously wanted to touch the place he was punched but he was met with the ugly and strange-looking trotter instead. His expression turned gloomy for a second before changing into a smile: \u201cOh no, you\u2019ve now realised that there\u2019s a problem?\u201d\u201cHow do you kill the Duke?\u201d You Huo repeated coldly.The witchdoctor\u2019s eyes rolled around. He was probably trying to think of a trick or thinking about negotiating something.You Huo threw him away like he was throwing away a piece of garbage. He turned around and dragged a sheep over and then he expressionlessly raised his knife.The witchdoctor had personally witnessed how scary he and Qin Jiu could be. Just that one time was enough to traumatise him.When he saw him about to cut off the sheep\u2019s leg, he curled up his legs and cried: \u201cYou must make him die voluntarily!\u201dYou Huo\u2019s movements stopped. His blade was only a few inches away from the leg.The witchdoctor breathed a sigh of relief.\u201cSpeak more specifically.\u201d You Huo stared him down.To avoid the same problem from occurring again, he forced the witchdoctor to reveal everything.\u201cThe moment he is killed, he must be willing to die.\u201d\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d You Huo frowned.The witchdoctor stared at the tip of his knife. Seeing that it had lowered by another inch, he quickly exclaimed: \u201cIt\u2019s not completely impossible!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cDid you forget? He is using someone else\u2019s body.\u201d The witchdoctor said quietly, \u201cThe heart that\u2019s beating inside him is someone else\u2019s heart. It\u2019s not impossible making him willing to die if you know of a way to wake up the remaining consciousness.\u201d\u201cLet me tell you a secret.\u201d The witchdoctor said: \u201cSome bodies have very strong willpowers. While the Duke is dying, the remnants of their consciousness may be forced out and that could be of help. After killing the Duke, remember to go as far away as possible; don\u2019t let him come into contact with anything living.\u201dYou Huo asked suspiciously: \u201cOnce the Duke is dead, what will happen to you?\u201dThe witchdoctor sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s a little troublesome, but it\u2019s not too bad.\u201dSeeing that he won\u2019t be able to get anything else out of him, You Huo threw him back.He turned and left.When he returned to the small hut, he suddenly heard soft rustling.Someone was pitifully calling out to him.You Huo followed the sound and looked around. He found the bloody priest hiding under the bed. The other party grabbed his boots and said hoarsely: \u201cDidn\u2019t you just leave? Why are you back?\u201dClearly, this pitiful man hiding here could no longer differentiate time. Although it was already the middle of the night, his memory was still stuck in the same state from this afternoon.The priest quietly whispered: \u201cBurn the castle. Remember\u2026\u2026..after killing the Duke, you must burn the castle. Don\u2019t listen to the witchdoctor. Must burn. Only fire can save the dead.\u201dAnd underground in a place no one could see, the witchdoctor secretly snickered: \u201cThe body has already been dead for more than three days. Even gods can\u2019t wake it up.\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Miss Yang Shu is actually a big softy.

The crimson coffin was gone.His Alyssa was gone!\u201cWho?!\u201d The Duke was furious. His eyes went red with anger.A light chuckle suddenly sounded behind him.The Duke violently turned his head back and saw that there was someone sitting on the windowsill.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u2026It\u2019s you. You\u2019re here again?\u201d The Duke tried to slow his breathing down and suppressed his tone to make it sound less disdainful, \u201cThe guests this time really won\u2019t give up. Despite knowing that it\u2019s futile, you still keep trying again and again.\u201dQin Jiu said: \u201cIt\u2019s different this time.\u201d\u201cHow is it different?\u201d\u201cI went and found that witchdoctor and used some not so nice methods.\u201d Qin Jiu was not in a hurry to reveal his cards: \u201cTry and guess. What do you think he told me?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe Duke\u2019s expression changed. He stared at him with narrowed eyes.Qin Jiu had gone to the dungeon and he had also found the priest separately to ask them about killing the Duke.The answer he received from the two were surprisingly consistent.One was cunning and sly, and the other was not in the right mind. Qin Jiu didn\u2019t intend to believe in their words completely and came to get more information out from the Duke.And so, he hid the wife that was hidden under the bed.Qin Jiu tilted his head and hopped off the windowsill. He approached the Duke fearlessly: \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dThe Duke\u2019s eyes were fixed on him. He then sneered: \u201cDon\u2019t try and scare me. I can\u2019t die. I will never die.\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re so certain?\u201d Qin Jiu said.He was confident and extremely calm. It was too convincing. The Duke once again started to doubt himself.\u201cI\u2019ve very certain.\u201d He furrowed his brows.Qin Jiu smiled: \u201cYou don\u2019t think you have some sort of misunderstanding about the witchdoctor\u2019s character? That\u2026\u2026\u2026lunatic who would teach other people evil arts?\u201d\u201cOf course, I know.\u201d The Duke smirked arrogantly, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m stupid? Stupid enough to let someone who is a threat to me to continue living? Of course, I have prepared some precautions. Everything he knows, I know. Everything he can do, I can too.\u201dQin Jiu\u2019s hand that was behind his back moved. He lifted up a book: \u201cYou\u2019re referring to this? You made a copy of his witchcraft book.\u201dThe Duke quickly glanced under the bed.\u201cSee? This was also something the witchdoctor told me.\u201dIn fact, he only vaguely guessed that the Duke may also have a book when he interrogated the witchdoctor and he inferred from that the most likely location it could be hidden in \u2014\u2014\u2013 Under Alyssa\u2019s coffin.No one dared to touch the Duchess, so no one would know about the book.The Duke sneered: \u201cYou just got lucky.\u201dHis neck twitched twice. It was as if his head was being disobedient again.\u201cNot only that, he also told me that between you and him\u2026\u2026.\u201d Qin Jiu stopped talking. He commented slowly: \u201cYou seem very nervous.\u201dHe didn\u2019t finish his sentence!The Duke cursed at him inside, but it was undeniable that Qin Jiu\u2019s words indeed made him nervous.The other party seemed to know a lot.It was noisy outside. The Duke\u2019s expression turned uglier.Qin Jiu pointed to the door: \u201cShould I tell the others outside about the circumstances between you and him? Maybe your servants or those interested would remember and then\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d The Duke\u2019s expression turned icy.Qin Jiu laughed. He waved the book in his hand and said, \u201cSee? It looks like you\u2019re not completely fearless. Why else would you hide this book?\u201dThe Duke\u2019s mouth twitched. His expression became more and more unsightly.In fact, everything just now was all nonsense made up by this Mr. Qin. Of course, those nonsense were also not baseless\u2014\u2014\u2013The Duke made a copy of the witchcraft book so that he could better understand the resurrection technique, but why didn\u2019t he destroy it afterwards? Why didn\u2019t he burn it like the witchdoctor? If he did, he wouldn\u2019t need to worry about others seeing it.Since he kept this book, it meant that he still needed it.On one hand, it was just as he had said himself. The witchdoctor\u2019s existence could pose as a threat to him but why did he allow the other party to continue living? He was even minding his own business and leaving the other party alone.The only possible explanation for this was\u2026\u2026\u2026For some reason, he either didn\u2019t dare kill him or he couldn\u2019t kill him.He guessed that there must be a deep connection between the Duke and the witchdoctor; one where their lives were interlinked.The witchdoctor helped the butler resurrect the Duke, but it was impossible for him to hand over the key to his life and death to another person for no reason.And so, this connection was one-sided, or more specifically, the consequences were one-sided.If the witchdoctor died, the Duke cannot live.But if the Duke died, the witchdoctor would be fine.\u201cYou can\u2019t kill me.\u201d The Duke continued to insist.Qin Jiu slowly approached him: \u201cWhy can\u2019t I? The book is in my possession and I have read everything I needed to read.\u201dThe witchcraft book referred to the resurrected being as the host.The method to kill the host was depicted in a picture. It was a picture of a person holding a knife up at the host with the tip only a few centimetres from their heart while the host didn\u2019t display any signs of resistance.Before the Duke returned, Qin Jiu had examined that picture numerous times. It was indeed similar to the witchdoctor\u2019s words.The Duke\u2019s reaction earlier also at least confirmed that the book was real.It didn\u2019t hurt to give it a try.***The dark clouds outside were heavy. Although it should be daytime, it looked no different from night.Zhou Qi\u2019s fever had receded as dawn approached but she still looked unwell and was rather restless.Zhao Jiatong couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cHad a nightmare?\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesZhou Qi nodded: \u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cI heard you sleeptalking.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u2026It was a chaotic nightmare.\u201d Zhou Qi said: \u201cI dreamt of my boyfriend. He was dragging me running and running, like we were being pursued by something. He then suddenly fell and fell behind. When I turned to grab him\u2026\u2026.A bunch of hands wielding knifes tried to cut us.\u201dZhou Qi\u2019s face turned even paler as she spoke: \u201cHe tried to protect me. All those knives\u2026\u2026.they all slashed through him. Blood was everywhere. My hands were covered in his blood.\u201dZhao Jiatong hurriedly poured her a glass of water. She patted her back and comforted: \u201cThere, there. That was just a dream\u2026\u2026\u201dGao Qi however looked out the window. His brows were furrowed, and he remained silent.Suddenly, a mixture of cries rang in the corridor outside.Zhou Qi\u2019s fingers shook, knocking the glass over in the process. She asked with confusion: \u201cWhat is this sound?\u201d\u201cNot good!\u201d Zhao Jiatong jumped up, \u201cThose wall shadows are back!\u201d\u201cWhat shadows?\u201dZhou Qi had been suffering from her fever the entire night, so she had not seen the wall shadows going amuck.But there was no time to explain.Gao Qi grunted as he also jumped up: \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that they will only appear when the Duke is weakened or dying?\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cThen who killed the Duke?\u201dZhao Jiatong frowned: \u201cThat can\u2019t be. Everyone knows that the curse would fall onto A and 001 if they kill the Duke. How could anyone go up and\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dShe suddenly stopped and exchanged looks with Gao Qi.Gao Qi rubbed his face and immediately cursed: \u201cFuck!\u201dOthers wouldn\u2019t, but that didn\u2019t exclude those two psychos.They all rushed out.They had originally wanted Yang Shu and Zhou Qi to stay in the room but they had followed them out before they could say anything.The corridor was filled with examinees. They all held their phones and used the torch to chase away the shadows.Gao Qi and Zhao Jiatong wanted to squeeze through this crowd and rush downstairs when they suddenly heard Zhou Qi\u2019s trembling voice: \u201cSister Zhao\u2026\u2026..Sister Zhao\u2026\u2026.I\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Zhao Jiatong exclaimed.Zhao Qi said: \u201cI think\u2026\u2026..I heard Jiang Yuan\u2019s voice.\u201dHer dark eyes were wide open as she stared at a certain stone wall. Her tightly clenched fists were shaking and even her eyelashes trembled.It was as if tears would fall out the moment she blinked.Zhao Jiatong immediately stopped in place: \u201cWhat voice? Who\u2019s Jiang Yuan?\u201dZhou Qi tried to keep her eyes open to prevent tears from falling.She said in a small voice: \u201cMy boyfriend\u2026\u2026..Amongst those cries, I seem to hear my boyfriend.\u201dZhao Jiatong went silent.She tried to reassure Zhou Qi: \u201cThat can\u2019t be. That\u2019s not possible. It must be the nightmare still affecting you\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true\u2026\u2026..Sister Zhao, I really heard it.\u201d Zhou Qi quietly insisted.Zhao Jiatong wanted to say something else when Gao Qi nudged her.She turned to glare at Gao Qi but suddenly understood when she saw his eyes.Several steps away, the stone wall suddenly started cracking.Under the lights from a dozen phones, cracks stretched across the surface until a large piece finally fell.When it fell to the ground, the people there finally realised that the stone wall was actually very thin. It covered the inner wall like a shell.Gao Qi shouted: \u201cGet away! Don\u2019t get hit!\u201dAs soon as he said that, someone exclaimed: \u201cMy god, what is this?!\u201dThose shadows were still struggling, and the crying continued. At times it would intensify when the lights are gathered onto one spot.That examinee took a few steps back. His voice cracked with fear: \u201cThere\u2019s people in the wall! Look!\u201dThere really were people in the wall.No, to be more precise, they weren\u2019t people; they here human body parts.Arms, legs, hands, feet, heads\u2026\u2026\u2026All sorts of dismembered parts were embedded into the wall. As more and more of the outer stone shell broke off, these parts similarly broke free.Everyone stood there petrified for a moment, unable to react. When they finally returned to their senses, they screamed and tried to avoid the falling objects.Within just a few minutes, the entire corridor had turned chaotic.Zhao Jiatong finally knew where the source of smell Zhou Qi had mentioned came from.Despite her army upbringing, she also panicked as a head with wide open eyes rolled past her feet.Everyone there, including both Zhao Jiatong and Gao Qi, retreated backwards instinctively.The only exception was Zhou Qi.Her eyes were firmly fixated on something as she stumbled closer.\u201cXiao Zhou, what are you doing?!\u201d Zhao Jiatong wanted to stop her, but she was too slow and her hand grabbed thin air.Zhou Qi eventually tripped. She had fallen right before the thing she was looking at.It was an upper torso. It wore a blue and grey plaid short-sleeved shirt that was stained with a large patch of blood along the neckline which ran down all the way to the chest. There was a shirt pocket on the left chest and the button there was very cheeky; it was a shiny bear head. It was clear that someone had changed it into that as a joke.The arm that was exposed was extremely pale, like those of mannequins in a shopping mall.Zhou Qi had forgotten to get back up. She sat there holding that arm in complete daze.Zhao Jiatong and Yang Shu followed behind her. Their expressions were uncomfortable.\u201cXiao Zhou\u2026\u2026..Xiao Zhou, don\u2019t be like this. Many people wear shirts like this.\u201d Zhao Jiatong\u2019s voice was hoarse.Zhou Ji didn\u2019t speak. It was as if she didn\u2019t hear her.After a while, she suddenly got up. Holding that arm, she looked around like a headless fly while murmuring quietly: \u201cWhat about the other\u2026\u2026..and\u2026\u2026\u201dShe spun around the corridor like she was crazy until she spotted a pair of legs wearing jeans not far away.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cWhat about the head? Sister Zhou\u2026..please help me. Yang Shu, please help me find it.\u201d She couldn\u2019t hold it up anymore, the torso and legs were about to fall. Tears streamed down from her eyes endlessly as she begged anxiously: \u201cPlease help me find it. Please find the head!!\u201dGao Qi couldn\u2019t take it anymore.He gritted his teeth tightly and closed his eyes for a few seconds. He then patted Zhou Qi\u2019s shoulder: \u201cYoung lass, don\u2019t cry. I know where it is. I\u2019ll take you there\u2026\u2026..\u201d***In the bedroom on the first floor of the west tower, Qin Jiu had his hand wrapped tightly around the Duke\u2019s neck. The mask had fallen off amidst the struggle and the face that belonged to a young man finally had a bit of colour to it.But the one speaking was still the Duke: \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026wasting\u2026..your\u2026\u2026..time. You\u2026\u2026can\u2019t\u2026.kill me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026will\u2026..never\u2026\u2026be able\u2026..to\u2026.kill me!\u201dAs he said that, he even tried to sneer.Qin Jiu frowed.Suddenly, the door to the bedroom was pushed open.When he turned to look, he saw Gao Qi, Zhao Jiatong and Yang Shu all standing at the door. In addition to them\u2026\u2026\u2026there was also a very dazed young lady.It was Zhou Qi.Please read this from kk translatesThis examinee was no longer wearing her mask. Her face that was reddened from crying was especially conspicuous.Qin Jiu froze. His grip around the Duke\u2019s neck subconsciously loosened.Unexpectedly, the Duke didn\u2019t use this opportunity to break free.When he looked over, he saw that the Duke similarly had his head turned. He stared at the door with a hint of confusion in his eyes.The next second, he turned his head in panic. Using his hands to cover his face, his cried out hoarsely: \u201cDon\u2019t look\u2026\u2026..don\u2019t look. Send her out. Get out!\u201dAlthough his voice was very quiet, it was still very clear in the quiet bedroom.After a long pause, Zhou Qi asked quietly with a nasal voice: \u201cJiang Yuan? You\u2026You can still talk? You\u2019re still alive?!\u201dShe rushed straight in. She stumbled and fell pitifully in front of the Duke.The Duke used his arm to cover his face. His neck once again awkwardly twitched.After the corner of his lips twitched for a few seconds, he finally said: \u201cQi Qi\u2026\u2026don\u2019t look\u2026\u2026..\u201dZhou Qi sat before him and anxiously grabbed his hand. The hand however wasn\u2019t the hand she remembered\u2026\u2026.It was completely different.She hastily rolled up the other party\u2019s sleeves and pulled down his neckline. The moment she saw the red stitch-like marks on the skin, she collapsed weakly onto the ground.After a long, long time, she hugged the Duke\u2019s neck and started bawling.\u201cI dreamt of you. I had nightmares all night long. Lots of people were holding knifes\u2026\u2026..they attacked you with it. You wouldn\u2019t let me see. You kept on pushing me and covering my eyes. Even if I cried or cursed, you didn\u2019t say anything\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026..Her cries filled the bedroom.Faced with a situation like this, no one stepped forward to say \u201cconvince him to be killed willingly\u201d.What\u2019s more, Qin Jiu still held some doubts about this.The Duke suddenly started writhing around strangely. The hands that were holding Zhou Qi\u2019s hand suddenly moved up to her neck and increased its strength.Zhou Qi\u2019s eyes widened. Her tears had not yet stopped. She looked at him blankly.Qin Jiu grabbed the Duke\u2019s wrist.\u201cWhat a touching reunion. After all this time, you still can\u2026..\u201d Before the Duke could finish ridiculing, his expression twisted into a miserable look and his fingers loosened.He didn\u2019t hesitate this time. He immediately pushed Zhou Qi away: \u201cQi Qi, listen to me\u2026\u2026..Don\u2019t come any closer. I\u2026\u2026I probably\u2026\u2026.can\u2019t last any longer. I don\u2019t know how long I can last.\u201dZhou Qi was in panic. Zhao Jiatong and Yang Shu came over to pull her away.The Duke suddenly grabbed Qin Jiu: \u201cHelp me\u2026\u2026help me, please. I don\u2019t want to be like this.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026..\u201d Qin Jiu frowned. He glanced over at Zhou Qi.The Duke\u2019s eyes were red. He appeared to be desperately trying not to look at Zhou Qi\u2019s face: \u201cIf this continues, one day all of you will be killed\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t want\u2026\u2026don\u2019t want to wake up one day and see myself holding someone\u2019s head\u2026\u2026.holding\u2026..Qi Qi\u2019s head\u2026..I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m really scared.\u201d\u201cThe witchdoctor said that the curse will only be lifted if the Duke is willing to be killed. Once he\u2019s dead, everyone will be saved.\u201d Qin Jiu said in a low voice, \u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a lie.\u201d Jiang Yuan struggled with his body and said desperately: \u201cI am him. I know him\u2026\u2026.It\u2019s a lie. He checked. I know it. The result of that is all his life\u2026\u2026\u2026all the life that he had accumulated\u2026..all his eternal life would be given to voluntarily to the witchdoctor.\u201dHe gritted his teeth and emphasised: \u201cThe real host is\u2026.the witchdoctor! Only the Duke can kill the witchdoctor but once the witchdoctor is dead, the Duke cannot live\u2026\u2026\u201dThey needed to make the Duke throw his life away and kill the witchdoctor, and they also needed to make the witchdoctor die willingly\u2026\u2026It was a deadly cycle. That was probably why they were in deadlock for so long.Jiang Yan seemed to be trying to finish saying everything while he was still conscious.He gasped and struggled against the Duke as he said: \u201c\u2026\u2026.I just know that the witchdoctor\u2019s life depends on the Duke. If the Duke is alive, the witchdoctor is healthy. If the duke is dead, as long as it wasn\u2019t death from sacrificing, the witchdoctor will be very weak. It\u2019s just\u2026.It\u2019s just, the Duke wouldn\u2019t possibly do that.\u201dIt was seemingly another dead end.Unfortunately, Jiang Yuan couldn\u2019t hold on any longer.He could no longer formulate any words and his body started twitching and writhing around more and more intensely.The corners of his eyes were wet. Without turning his head, he squeezed out a few last words: \u201cGo\u2026..take her\u2026\u2026..please\u2026\u2026..\u201dZhou Qi had cried too much. She had exhausted almost all the energy she had.Zhao Jiatong and Yang Shu clenched their teeth and carried her out.Gao Qi didn\u2019t move. Qin Jiu grabbed the Duke by the neck again and used the curtain rope to tie him up. After he was done, he looked up and said to Gao Qi: \u201cHelp me out.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Gao Qi was a little worried about him.\u201cRelax, I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d Qin Jiu reassured: \u201cDo you trust me?\u201dGao Qi remained silent.\u201cWe\u2019re wasting time standing around like this. You\u2019re not someone who likes to dawdle, right?\u201dGao Qi took a deep breath and finally forced out a word: \u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cGo to the kitchen. Get some people and prepare some firewood and oil. Get as much as you can.\u201d\u201cWhat for?\u201d\u201cBurning the castle.\u201dGao Qi froze: \u201cWhen? Now?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cWait for my signal.\u201dGao Qi stared at him. He then said through gritted teeth: \u201cYou said it. You must remain standing and give me a signal!\u201dQin Jiu said: \u201cOkay, I got it. I\u2019ll leave the rest to you.\u201dHe had thought of a method. It was a little risky, and a little crazy.If You Huo knew\u2026\u2026\u2026He settled the Duke into his armchair and began to place candles around it.If You Huo knew\u2026\u2026Would he feel refreshed and happy? Or would he give him a punch?If it was the past, it would definitely be the former. But now\u2026\u2026.He was suddenly uncertain.He didn\u2019t know why he felt this.But when he thought of You Huo, a smile crept onto his face.In any case, it was better not to let him know for now.Qin Jiu thought this.He lit the candles and looked at the tacked together man in the armchair. From within his pocket, he pulled out a long-forgotten card.He glanced out the window in a certain direction. He then looked back and stepped into the ring of candles.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hopefully that madman would be more cooperative.He boarded a carriage in town and dragged the witchdoctor back to the castle.The castle was in chaos. The corridors were filled with examinees.You Huo immediately sensed that something wasn\u2019t right, but he didn\u2019t stop his steps. Compared to the other things, the matter at hand was more urgent.Dim candlelight peeked out from inside the room. You Huo who had one hand dragging the witchdoctor and the other holding a knife looked down at the light falling at his feet and suddenly felt his heart tremble.The door creaked open.He stiffly looked in and saw the Duke sitting in his armchair with a look of intense agony. He seemed to be experiencing pain and discomfort from the separation of his soul from his body and his entire body writhed around violently.As if there was an invisible hand grabbing him by his chest, his entire body lifted upwards.The buttons of his coat broke off, revealing the shirt inside and the blood-red stitches on his skin. It looked like those fine stitches\u2026\u2026..were slowly being pulled apart by something.The head, chest and limbs were all twisted into strange angles.The next second, those limbs finally broke off and separated from the body\u2026\u2026..Once that body was abandoned, the owner found a new replacement.The new duke had his back towards the door. Getting up from his knelt position in front of the armchair, his hand that was originally placed onto the Duke\u2019s head was removed.With his tall back illuminated by the candlelight, the man flexed his fingers as if experiencing something very novel.As he flexed, the cracking of bones could be heard.In an instant, You Huo felt like all the blood in his body was gone. His heart pounded rapidly.It was clearly only warm candlelight, but at this moment he found it very blinding.When he opened his eyes again, that new Duke had turned to look back\u2026\u2026.It was Qin Jiu.The moment their eyes met, You Huo suddenly could no longer feel the knife in his hand.It was only when the other party revealed a guilty and slightly surprised look that he was finally able to feel the pain around his knuckles\u2026\u2026The hand that barely had some intact flesh remaining had at some unknown point in time clenched tightly around the handle.His jaw twitched. After clenching his teeth tightly for a moment, he called out: \u201cQin Jiu?\u201dHis voice was hoarse. It was unknown whether it was because of the pain caused by the curse, or because he was nervous.It wasn\u2019t until this moment that he realised that he was actually nervous.And he was even\u2026\u2026..a little flustered.The other party was silent for a moment. Perhaps it was because it was too unexpected.After a few seconds, he answered \u201cyes\u201d with a similarly hoarse voice.All the blood in his body returned.You Huo\u2019s face was extremely pale, like those of snow. He closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths before approaching him with his knife.Qin Jiu politely dodged a few attacks, but he almost didn\u2019t fight back at all. With just a few blows, he was pressed down onto the ground.You Huo knelt onto him, pressing him down. The knife he held was held less than two centimetres away from Qin Jiu\u2019s neck.\u201cAre you crazy?!\u201dQin Jiu wasn\u2019t concerned about the knife that was threatening him. He rested his elbow on the ground to support his upper body and said reassuringly, \u201cI\u2019m not crazy, don\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t be angry. I only did this because I have a hidden card.\u201dHis voice was both low and deep. It echoed inside the bedroom like a dull cello playing in the night.He picked up a card and said to You Huo: \u201cRemember this? The one I drew. I can learn any ability in an exam.\u201dWhen he heard Jiang Yuan\u2019s words earlier, he had suddenly realised that there was a way for him to lead the Duke to his death.To achieve eternal life, the Duke used other peoples\u2019 body and because the other person didn\u2019t have eternal life, when they die, he would subsequently be able to take over and become its owner.But what if the person the Duke tried to take over would never die?The Duke wouldn\u2019t be able to control that body.And so, he used the \u201cLast-minute Cramming\u201d card and learnt the Duke\u2019s \u201cEternal Life\u201d ability.Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen. Please don\u2019t support those thieves, the translator KK is going to cry\u2026You Huo\u2019s breathing was still very heavy and his expression was still icy. He was clearly still angry.Grabbing Qin Jiu by the collar, he threw out a few words with great emphasis: \u201cThe card mentioned \u2018a certain probability\u2019. Where did you get the confidence that it would definitely work?\u201dQin Jiu opened his mouth.He wanted to say that he shouldn\u2019t underestimate his willpower; if Jiang Yuan could last that long, he shouldn\u2019t be worse than him.He also wanted to say that no one can be 100% certain about anything. All things require taking some risks and he should be familiar with that too.With his usual character, those were words that he would\u2019ve normally said.But when he saw You Huo\u2019s tightly pursed lips and tensed figure, he suddenly felt like he could understand his anger.He suddenly reached out and rubbed the corner of You Huo\u2019s lips with his thumb.Because of the curse, and also because of his extremely pale skin, the veins on the side of his neck had become clearly visible. A blue vein travelled up along his chin, stopping at the corner of his lips.Qin Jiu finally said, \u201cI promise. I won\u2019t do anything this risky in the future.\u201dYou Huo had his eyes lowered. When Qin Jiu reached out to rub his lip a second time, he turned his head away: \u201cSave those words to deceive the others.\u201dSuddenly, there were scratching sounds from not far away.When the two looked up, they saw the Duke\u2019s separated limbs scratching frantically at the door trying to get out. It was as if they wanted to find other body parts to combine with.The door was soon scratched open by them and earth-shattering screams and cries instantly rushed into the room.It was more terrifying than those black shadows.This time it wasn\u2019t just the walls. The entire castle had started shaking.In a place that couldn\u2019t be seen by them, Gao Qi and Zhao Jiatong had cleared out a bloody path for the other examinees. From the third to the first floor, they desperately tried to send the examinees out safely.All the dead souls that had died in the castle had appeared. Severed bodies, spirits\u2026\u2026.They attacked everyone with overwhelming hatred.\u201cWhy did they suddenly go crazy?!\u201d Zhao Jiatong kicked one down.Gao Qi shouted back: \u201cThe Duke must be about the die!!! 001 said he has a way!!!\u201d\u201cWhat? You actually believed that?! When has he ever not gone overboard???\u201dGao Qi: \u201cWhat can you do if he goes overboard?! Also, who am I to worry about that???\u201dZhao Jiatong thought about it and decided to shut up.Gao Qi contined: \u201cTrust in him. I think he\u2019s actually quite reliable! Let\u2019s get the other things sorted so he would be less distracted!\u201dZhao Jiatong readily agreed: \u201cOkay!\u201dThey used to be from the army, so they knew about division of labour and they also knew about the importance of trusting one another.\u201cThat\u2019s right, what about A?!\u201d Zhao Jiatong then remembered, \u201cHow long has it been since confinement? Why hasn\u2019t he returned yet?\u201dGao Qi froze for a moment. He suddenly rubbed his face: \u201cI have a bad feeling.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhen those two go overboard, they have always been together.\u201dNow that they\u2019re separated, something would definitely not be right if anything was to happen.What if they each went more overboard than the other?Soon afterwards, the door to the castle was knocked open. A large group of bloodied humans rushed in.Even those from the church had come to join in on the fun.Some spirits who had caught onto the Duke\u2019s and the witchdoctor\u2019s scent rushed over to the west tower like beasts chasing after the scent of fresh meat.The bedroom door was knocked open and a large mass of spirits and severed body parts rushed over towards the two people inside.You Huo stored away his knife and pulled Qin Jiu up.\u201cNo longer angry?\u201d Qin Jiu kicked aside a spirit as he asked.Dream on.You Huo cut three down without saying anything.Qin Jiu wanted to say something else but he suddenly felt a chill.It was a very strange feeling. It was as if\u2026\u2026a soul was slowly pulling away and gradually disappearing.He grabbed You Huo but in the end it was bone coming into contact with bone.Both froze. Through the gloves and sleeves, they could both seemingly picture the almost non-existent and bloody flesh underneath.\u201cStop looking. What did you want to say?\u201d You Huo urged.The spirits around them were endless. Qin Jiu said as he dodged, \u201cThe Duke is dying. I can feel that he is almost at his limit.\u201dYou Huo frowned.\u201cIf he really dies, then no one can kill the witchdoctor.\u201d Qin Jiu continued, \u201cI have to hurry. Otherwise I risked it all for nothing.\u201dThose words of his reminded You Huo of something.His expression was strange for a moment, as if he also felt a little guilty.With this, that cold anger of his could no longer be maintained.You Huo narrowed his eyes and threw a severed limb away, \u201cBefore I came, I also had a plan\u2026\u2026..\u201dQin Jiu froze. He turned around and saw the witchdoctor in the corner that was surrounded by the spirits.He immediately frowned: \u201cNo!\u201dYou Huo: \u201cWho was the one who went crazy first?! What right do you have to say no?\u201dQin Jiu couldn\u2019t speak.With You Huo\u2019s personality, if he wanted to do anything, he would do it without giving anyone an explanation. This time however, he looked at Qin Jiu and pulled out a piece of parchment paper, \u201cThe curse has reached this point now. We\u2019re practically spirits.\u201dSince he was already dead, what was wrong with taking another knife?\u201cNo.\u201d Qin Jiu continued to insist stubbornly. He stared at You Huo and said seriously, \u201cEven if you\u2019re a spirit, you can\u2019t.\u201dYou Huo looked back at him. After a short pause, he finally frowned and nodded: \u201cUp to you.\u201dThe spirits sensed the Duke\u2019s scent and rushed over to surround Qin Jiu in a frenzied state. For the first time, You Huo didn\u2019t immediately go over to help. Instead, he went to the door and dragged the witchdoctor over.The screams and wails were very painful to listen to.Qin Jiu glanced at the witchdoctor through the corner of his eyes.The other party was indeed in a very weak state. He was curled up in the corner and trembling gently, like someone who was seriously ill.Qin Jiu stretched his leg out and kicked the witchdoctor into the ring of candles.In fact, he had already thought about it. Since he had acquired the immortality ability, if he could do the change once, he could do the change twice.Please read this from kk translatesAnd the riskiest part of it was, he wanted to do an exchange with the witchdoctor\u2014\u2014Before the Duke\u2019s soul could leave completely, he would let the witchdoctor\u2019s soul in and stab himself.That was the most convenient method.Although the feeling of multiple souls squeezing inside his body was extremely uncomfortable, and almost on par to death, it was only for a short moment.He already has experience.In fact, he also knew that You Huo\u2019s method was feasible. Apart for a short moment of pain and an imminent sense of death, it wouldn\u2019t cause any substantial or irreversible damage.But he still didn\u2019t want to agree to it.The moment the witchdoctor entered the ring of candles, the flames rose instantly. It was as if it could sense the soul and it resonated madly with it.Those spirits also appeared to similarly sense it. Its attacks became more intense.For a few seconds, there was a blind spot in Qin Jiu\u2019s vision.He faintly heard a quiet voice that sounded like a witchcraft incantation.That hoarse voice made his heart grow cold.The moment he managed to push away the spirits around him, a hand rested on his shoulder. Soon afterwards, a body with slightly lower than average body temperature moved closer. The collar was a little damp, and it carried the scent of rain from a midsummer\u2019s night.\u201cBig Invigilator, is it raining outside?\u201dThis phrase suddenly flashed through his mind.A cold object was stuffed into Qin Jiu\u2019s hand. It was the knife handle.Immediately afterwards, the other end of the knife stabbed something.You Huo\u2019s hoarse voice rang from beside his ear: \u201cDon\u2019t go crazy a second time.\u201d***Gao Qi had not seen such a big fire in a very long time.The last time he saw one was many, many years ago when he was still in the army. It was for disaster relief or something\u2026\u2026..he no longer remembered.Ever since he entered the system, there were a lot of things he no longer remembered.Fire enveloped the entire castle. It burned brightly to the point the sky had even turned red.Zhao Jiatong looked at him worriedly. She wiped away the ashes from his face and asked: \u201cHow are you? Hands still shaking?\u201dOnly God knows how panicked he was when he came out of the castle.He had prepared all the wood and oil as requested but when he hurried to the Duke\u2019s bedroom to get the signal, he saw A with a knife in his chest and Qin Jiu holding him up.The moment he saw that, Gao Qi\u2019s heart almost stopped!Fortunately, the effect soon took place.The witchdoctor had willingly let the Duke kill him, so all the witchcraft had been reset.He watched the blood on Qin Jiu and You Huo gradually lessen, the mutilated flesh slowly heal up and the colour slowly restored onto their pale complexions.You Huo who was leaning on Qin Jiu\u2019s shoulder furrowed his brows and reopened his eyes.All the examinees evacuated the castle one after another. In less than a few minutes, the fire burning the castle could almost reach the sky.On the field outside, the bloodied patients slowly recovered and regained their humanly appearance. They slowly sat up and looked at their arms and legs in daze.Light pierced through the dark clouds in the sky, falling onto these people.These people had been hiding away inside the church for a very, very long time and had almost forgotten what the sun was like.Now, they no longer had to hide and could stand tall under the light they had been missing all this time\u2026\u2026\u2026.After a very long time, several people suddenly appeared from within the fire.Those with sharper eyesight cried out with surprise: \u201cZhang Pengyi???\u201dMore people stood up. They all looked over with disbelief.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026While almost all the examinees were gathered together, there were two who stood far from the crowd.At the end of the field was a row of tall metal fences which looked like the generic fences one would see surrounding a manor. Behind those fences was a thick fog, and through the thick fog you could see the invigilator\u2019s cabin located at the top of Carlton Mountain.But You Huo didn\u2019t go through it. He just leaned against the fence watching the excited people in front of the castle from afar.After the soul withdraws, one would feel tired and fatigued.He didn\u2019t like noise. Right now, he didn\u2019t want to hear the exclamations and shouts.He also didn\u2019t want to move. What\u2019s more, there was another person next to him who appeared to be in a bad mood.Ever since Qin Jiu came out from the castle, his face had been held taut.Like it was on the verge of exploding but was forcefully restrained, he silently suppressed his anger.In fact, the same was true for You Huo.He remembered Qin Jiu\u2019s risk taking, Qin Jiu remembered his. They were no better than the other and were both holding in their anger with nowhere to vent.You Huo for some reason felt irritable.His heart was still racing from the aftermath of doing something so risky, and drowsiness and exhaustion surged through him, but his mind was still exceptionally clear.The silk shirt and tall boots that had yet to be changed out of were still covered in traces of blood that emitted a rusty scent.There was something in his pocket. When You Huo noticed it, he reached inside and pulled it out.It was the packet of cigarettes and lighter Gao Qi had given him.He normally didn\u2019t smoke but at this moment he suddenly wanted one to refresh himself.Qin Jiu suddenly said: \u201cLend me one.\u201dYou Huo handed him a cigarette and then flicked open the lighter to light his own cigarette.The thin cloud of smoke from the cigarette almost connected with the fog behind him. It stung his eyes slightly.You Huo closed his eyes and didn\u2019t suck it in.He had intended to remove the cigarette and just watch it burn when the person next to him suddenly leaned over.Qin Jiu leaned forward into the cloud of smoke with his eyes narrowing slightly.Held in his lips was the cigarette. He lowered his head and the end of his cigarette met with You Huo\u2019s.A red ball of fire brightened.The figure before him soon moved back. Qin Jiu had straightened himself back up.A moment later, he removed his cigarette and once again leaned over.You Huo had his back against the fence. Fog travelling through the gaps brought along ambiguous humidity.The worries and anger from earlier, the suffocation and irritation that couldn\u2019t be voiced; at this moment they all finally could be vented.As the effect of the curse dissipated, the last piece of flesh on Qin Jiu\u2019s wrist healed.The red warning light that had been silent for a long time was flashing wildly at this moment. Beeping sounds of warning rang nonstop in between the interspersed sounds of breathing.Far ahead was the crowd and the fire.Behind them was the invigilator\u2019s cabin separated by the fog.They kissed under the warning alarm.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: A KISS!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His gaze fell and landed on You Huo\u2019s lips.They were still breathing quite heavily. Their breaths staggered with one anothers.The warning alarm had never gone off for this long. It continued like it was broken.But no one paid it any attention.\u201cBig Invigilator, your breathing is a little rough.\u201d Qin Jiu said in a low voice.It is said that light-coloured eyes reveal one\u2019s concealed emotions.But the beautiful eyes before him was covered with a thin layer of haze. It was half-open and half-closed as its owner breathed rapidly, and it was damper and mistier than the fog behind them.You Huo turned his head to the side to recover but it was to no avail.After a while, he turned his head back and answered Qin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026A normal reaction to lack of oxygen.\u201d\u201cNormal reaction\u2026\u2026\u201d Qin Jiu repeated that phrase. As he caught his breath, he laughed: \u201cA kiss with another man in broad daylight is also our Big Invigilator\u2019s normal reaction?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dYou Huo moved his lips. He said a moment later: \u201cWhat happened in the castle can be overlooked.\u201d\u201cWhat happened in the castle? A lot of things happened in the castle.\u201dQin Jiu continued: \u201cAre you referring to the fact that you originally promised not to take this risk, but you later secretly did the exchange with the witchdoctor behind my back? Or\u2026..when you forcibly grabbed my hand and used it to stab yourself before I could realise what was happening? Or\u2026..the fact that you tried to deceive me with a hug afterwards while you died in my arms and only reopened your eyes after what felt like almost a century?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThree options. You can pick one to overlook.\u201d Qin Jiu said.You Huo: \u201cWhat about you? You wanted to exchange yourself a second time and stab yourself. You thought I didn\u2019t know?\u201dQin Jiu lowered his eyes and looked down at him. He suddenly said: \u201cMy heartrate is at an all-time high. Can\u2019t really tell if its from anger or from something else.\u201dHis index finger rested against You Huo\u2019s lower jaw and he used his thumb to rub his lower lip.You Huo\u2019s heart was beating equally fast.He glanced down at Qin Jiu\u2019s fingers and said with a hoarse voice: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026There is a psychological thing called the suspension bridge effect.\u201d\u201cSuspension bridge effect?\u201d Qin Jiu chuckled. His thumb gently moved away, and he leaned down again to kiss You Huo\u2019s slightly parted lips, \u201cDoes the suspension bridge effect include kissing until your neck is red?\u201dThe moment Qin Jiu bowed his head down, perhaps it was because he was so close, a scene from a long time ago appeared in You Huo\u2019s mind.It was fuzzy but familiar\u2026\u2026..It was almost as if it was something from a dream.***That day was a day similar to today. It was the middle of summer.Perhaps it was because the weather was hot and blistering, it made it easy for one to become impulsive and swayed by their emotions.At that time, You Huo was still Invigilator A. Qin Jiu was almost at the end of the exam.It was his 11<sup>th</sup> violation. It took him a day to clean up the examination centre and he was left in Invigilator A\u2019s confinement room for the remaining two days.It was the evening of the second day.Holding a glass of water, Qin Jiu was sitting on the edge of his bed. His hair was wet, and his clean shirt was slightly unbuttoned at the collar, revealing his strong chest and shoulder muscles.He took a sip of water and turned to look at You Huo: \u201cThank you dear Big Invigilator for your efforts to add a bathroom to the confinement room. Without it, you would\u2019ve probably cut off all contact with me.\u201dPlease read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen. Please don\u2019t support those thieves, the translator KK is going to cry\u2026You Huo stood on the side waiting for him to finish drinking to take his glass away.\u201cThe system didn\u2019t suspect anything?\u201d Qin Jiu asked.\u201cThose facilities were originally available in confinement rooms a long time ago. It was later removed but it has added it back.\u201d You Huo said, \u201cFuture examinees will also be able to use it.\u201dHe spoke very calmly. Qin Jiu appreciated it for a while and said: \u201cIt must have been deceived by your expression.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.Are you thirsty or not? You only took two sips over five minutes.\u201d You Huo said.\u201cChanging the topic again.\u201d Qin Jiu obediently took another sip and said, \u201cEvery time we\u2019re on a less serious topic, you would always change the topic. Are you in a hurry to leave?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cHot.\u201dThe confinement room actually wasn\u2019t stuffy; the ventilation wasn\u2019t bad and the humidity from the shower had quickly dissipated.But it still carried remnants of heat.Qin Jiu said: \u201cIt was obviously hotter here twenty minutes ago but you weren\u2019t in a hurry to leave then.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe stiffened his handsome and naturally cold face and snatched the glass from Qin Jiu: \u201cRemember what I said earlier. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\u201cWhat was it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe had forgotten as soon as he was done speaking.Invigilator A really wanted to hit him.Qin Jiu hopped off the bed and said: \u201cYou mean how you wanted me to quickly get lost after the exam, the further the better, and that I must not become an invigilator?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe clearly said that he wanted Qin Jiu to successfully pass the exam, leave the system and stop trying to jump into the fire pit.But\u2026\u2026.if he wanted to take it that way, it wasn\u2019t wrong.\u201cI came here with a purpose. Did you forget? Even if the system kicks me out, I will do everything to come back.\u201d Qin Jiu said.\u201cYour purpose is the same as mine. I know this place better than you and I am more familiar with the system so it\u2019s easier for the system to relax its vigilance and easier for the purpose to be achieved.\u201d You Huo frowned: \u201cYou don\u2019t have a reason to be tied up down here.\u201dBecause of his worries, he felt a little irritable.\u201cReason?\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cI have one right in front of me. The one throwing out harsh words without looking back.\u201dYou Huo stopped in front of the door.\u201cI\u2019m suddenly a little curious. In your eyes, what kind of relationship do we have?\u201d Qin Jiu said.You Huo stood there for a while and said after a pause: \u201cInvigilator and examinee.\u201dWhen he was done, silence filled the room. The arrogant and conceited person behind him suddenly became quiet.You Huo\u2019s expression was calm but the finger joints around the glass were slightly pale.After a very long time, just as he decided to open the door, light footsteps suddenly sounded behind him.Soon afterwards, it was Qin Jiu\u2019s scent.With his head lowered, he said next to You Huo\u2019s ear: \u201cOther invigilators and examinees don\u2019t sleep together, Big Invigilator.\u201dYou Huo\u2019s eyelashes trembled.They were in a position that was almost like he was being embraced from behind, but there was also a sense of confrontation between them.\u201cI\u2019ve already grown used to your prickly words. The more worried you are, the sharper your tongue. I haven\u2019t seen you be this harsh to anyone else. With just this, I will definitely come back.\u201d Qin Jiu said.\u201cEven if the system throws me out and clears out my memory, I will come back.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.The castle burned for a long time. There were no indications of it extinguishing. It was as if there were too many things that needed to be burned clean.The Duke\u2019 and the witchdoctor\u2019s souls had long since dissipated. With the curse lifted and everything returning to normal, all the body remnants and corpses slowly returned to its original, living state.Those who were reborn rushed out from the fire to greet the sun again.In the fire, all life and death had returned to its starting point.In a corner of the castle, a crimson red coffin shook a few times. Someone inside was screaming in panic, trying to get out.Even since the Duke\u2019s resurrection, that coffin had beeen hidden under his bed.Every few days he would call out \u201cMy Alyssa\u201d and would look for women similar to her to cut off their heads and limbs to try and bring Alyssa back.But he had never opened that wooden coffin.Please read this from kk translatesHe had it hidden under his bed. From the day he placed it there until now\u2026\u2026.it was had never been opened.That witchcraft technique required the person to be resurrected and the sacrifice to be placed together inside a ring of candles.The Duke himself had done it countless times; he was extremely familiar with the process.But every time\u2026\u2026every time he went to find the women, he had never brought Alyssa along.It wasn\u2019t because he was afraid of severed limbs.He had seen plenty of them, and he had done it plenty of times himself. He just didn\u2019t want to see the face inside that coffin; he didn\u2019t want to see the woman lying inside.Because that woman wasn\u2019t Alyssa.The real Alyssa had been taken away by the witchdoctor the day the Duke was resurrected.The witchdoctor said that his body was too old, that it couldn\u2019t last much longer. His life and the Duke\u2019s life was connected. If he was weak, the Duke would also be weak; if he died, the Duke would also die.He needed a suitable body to take over to ensure that the Duke could live a long and healthy life.In fact, there were many bodies they could choose from, but the butler chose the one most intimate in relationship with the Duke.He knew that the Duchess loved her husband dearly. If the witchdoctor took over the Duchess\u2019s body, perhaps he would be influenced by the original and would always be loyal to the Duke.And so that night, the butler only resurrected the Duke and the witchdoctor took over the Duchess\u2019s body. In return, the servants\u2019 spirits were summoned back.But he didn\u2019t stay in the castle. Instead, he went to the church in town and pretended to be a nun. It was because there were more living humans in the town, enough for him to use.The butler was afraid that the Duke would be upset when he wakes up, so he chopped up the woman he had lured over and placed a mask on her face.He said to the Duke: \u201cThe resurrection failed. I don\u2019t know what went wrong.\u201dThe Duke stood beside the pool of blood, staring unblinkingly at the face that was half covered by a mask. After a long time, he said to the butler: \u201cPut her in the coffin.\u201dSince then, he could only turn a blind eye to it.He could ask the witchdoctor to change to another body, but he didn\u2019t.He just quietly hid \u201cAlyssa\u201d under his bed and made everyone in the castle wear masks to show everyone how much he missed her.But\u2026\u2026.she could never be resurrected.When the red coffin was finally broken open, a young woman with dishevelled hair climbed out. She reunited with her unfortunate husband somewhere in the castle and left the place together.In the corridor that was surrounded by fire, oil paintings were scattered across the floor. The paint dried and cracked with the heat, and soon burned black.The Duchess\u2019s lips pursed tightly under the scorching heat. From a rising smile, it slowly formed a straight line before turning down slightly. It carried some loneliness, and also some sorrow.Her body laid inside a once magnificent bedroom while the Duke\u2019s original body was buried somewhere else under the scorched earth. Separated by thousands of metres, one burned to ash while the other rotted into the earth. Never again will their fates intersect.Outside the castle, Jiang Yuan stumbled out into the crowd. Zhou Qi ran to embrace him. They both laughed and jumped, and finally sat down and cried in each other\u2019s arms.Even further away, the invigilator\u2019s received a notice.The system had sounded out the longest alarm in history, but the three invigilators only received a blank note.It was because it couldn\u2019t find any basis for punishment, or any rules to support it\u2026\u2026\u2026Why was it that two people who had no memories, who had been separated for several years and are now of opposite identities were still able to get together?That\u2019s why they say that love and hate are very mysterious things.Some have already rotted away.Others are engraved into the bone.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: \u201cOther invigilators and examinees don\u2019t sleep together, Big Invigilator.\u201dAHHHH (\u2267\u2200\u2266)\u309e(\u2267\u2200\u2266)\u309e(\u2267\u2200\u2266)\u309e(\u2267\u2200\u2266)\u309e(\u2267\u2200\u2266)\u309ePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The system would soon calculate the final scores so the invigilator\u2019s got ready to leave.But shortly after they got onto their carriages, a heart-attack inducing alarm sounded.Inside the carriage, outside the carriage, inside the cabin; that sound came from all directions. All the invigilators immediately scrambled back into the cabin.922\u2019s hair was still messy from sleep and 021 had just removed make up from one of her eyes.They covered their ears to protect it from the loud warning sounds and 922 shouted at 154: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?

What does that mean? Has this happened before?\u201dThe noise irritated 021. She said with unkindly: \u201cNo, this must be a bug.\u201dWhen she turned to get back onto the carriage, the warning sounds grew louder.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d021 expressionlessly stopped in place.

They managed to develop feelings amidst all the fighting and killing?\u201d 922 continued to mutter: \u201cIf it was so easy to develop, why would he have been single until now?\u201d\u201cMm\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe three single dogs stood there in thought.\u201cBut what does it have to do with system security?\u201d 922 suddenly asked.No one could answer.Under the system\u2019s persistent urging the three invigilators gave up their chance to rest and decided to go down the mountain to check on the situation.Their main priority was to see what Qin Jiu had done again to make the system go crazy like this.When they reached the base of the mountain, they realised\u2026\u2026..The system had not only gone crazy, it had also gone on strike.While the castle was burnt to crisp and the examinees sat on the grass field outside, the system didn\u2019t move to calculate the scores and just went over to the invigilator\u2019s area to vent. It was only after the arrival of the invigilators that a black crow flew over and landed in front of the castle to speak:\u3010All patients have been cured. Examinees have completed their paper. The examination has ended.\u3011\u3010Now finalising the rewards and penalties.\u3011922: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dFor some reason, he felt that the system was strangely a little scared.The examinees who had gone through great sorrow and joy sat there with a look of exhaustion.Amongst them, Gao Qi was particularly conspicuous. Hugging his knees and resting his head against a worn-out stone sculpture, he looked\u2026\u2026\u2026lifeless.Next to him, Zhao Jiatong and Yang Shu would occasionally glance over at him.922 stood closest to them.Taking advantage of the moment the system was busy summarising the exam, he crouched down and poked Gao Qi\u2019s shoulder: \u201cAre you okay? As an invigilator you shouldn\u2019t become like this just from an exam.\u201dGao Qi glanced weakly at him. He looked like he wanted to say something, but he hesitated and hung his head back down again.\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d 922 pointed at him and asked Zhao Jiatong.\u201cWho knows?\u201d Zhao Jiatong said, \u201cWhen the fire was almost done, I thought it was time for the scores to be calculated so I got him to call the others over. Even since he returned, he had been like this.\u201dAfter she said that, she pushed Gao Qi\u2019s shoulder: \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201dGao Qi: \u201cFed some poison.\u201dZhao Jiatong: \u201c\u2026\u2026..Then you can go be poisoned to death.\u201d\u201cLook, just like that.\u201d She looked at 922 and spread open her hands. When she was done, she turned to ask Yang Shu.Yang Shu said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Looks like he had received some shock.\u201dInvigilator 1006 who had just received some shock continued to look into the distance. His good friend Invigilator A and his old nemesis 001 were currently coming over while talking to Zhou Qi and Jiang Yuan.You Huo and Qin Jiu was caught by this young couple from amongst the crowd.Jiang Yuan was no longer wearing the mask and, coupled with his plaid shirt and jeans, he looked like he was in his early twenties. Even after crying until his eyes were red and swollen, his youthful vitality couldn\u2019t be concealed.It was clear that the same face can look very different when used by different souls.He expressed his sincere thanks to You Huo and Qin Jiu. He thanked them for being a team with Zhou Qi, thanked them for not letting Zhou Qi be in danger and thanked them for taking care of Zhou Qi.Zhou Qi on the other hand thanked them for bringing Jiang Yuan back to life.They were so excited; their words of gratitude were a little messy and the same content was repeated several times.Perhaps that was the only way for them to express how thankful they were.You Huo and Qin Jiu didn\u2019t like to listen to other people\u2019s long speeches, but at this moment they patiently listened to their fervent thanks.The field covered in overgrown weeds was originally the castle\u2019s garden. Many broken sculptures were littered across the field.Qin Jiu stood there with his elbow resting on a sculpture.He had his head lowered as he listened to the young couple chatter and would occasionally nod and say a few words.You Huo leaned on the other side of the sculpture with one hand fiddling with his earring and the other holding his elbow.He spoke very little and just listened.Soon, the system began to announce the scores.Zhou Qi and Jiang Yuan stopped talking.Qin Jiu glanced behind them and asked You Huo: \u201cGoing over?\u201dYou Huo\u2019s finger that was touching his earring paused. He glanced over at the black crow ahead: \u201cCan\u2019t you see that Gao Qi\u2019s about to faint?\u201d\u201cI saw.\u201d\u201cThen give him a chance to breathe.\u201dTo be honest, Qin Jiu didn\u2019t expect Gao Qi to go and find them.Qin Jiu said: \u201cThe psychological endurance capacity of this old friend of yours is too weak.\u201dYou Huo glanced at him.Qin Jiu: \u201cWhat? Am I wrong?\u201dPlease read this from kk translates\u201cDidn\u2019t get along, always in disagreement, enemies.\u201d You Huo threw out these phrases one at time, \u201cThese were what you said before. Think about it first before you evaluate Gao Qi\u2019s psychological endurance capacity.\u201dQin Jiu rubbed his neck.If he thought about it from a different perspective, Gao Qi was indeed a quite pitiful.The two continued to talk to each other and paid no attention to their scores.The black crow responsible for reporting the results angrily flapped its wings losing a few of its feathers in the process.They only looked over when it was done with its announcement.Although this exam was a little difficult, the score wasn\u2019t bad.Just the points received from the Duke was enough padding for the groups and if they added the other points, they had enough for everyone to get past the B grade.\u3010Examinees ranked B or above can successfully continue onto their next examination. The carriages have already been prepared. Please return to the carriage you arrived on within 5 minutes. You will be sent back to the rest stop for a short break.\u3011Because they had once again completed the exam ahead of the scheduled time, the final examinees who managed to solve the problem, namely You Huo and Qin Jiu, would each have a chance to draw a card.922 sighed: \u201cCard drawing used to be a rare privilege. But now with those two\u2026\u2026they\u2019re basically getting one every day.\u201dHe dug out a deck of cards from his pocket and glanced at Gao Qi.\u201cWhy are they looking at you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t know. Maybe because I\u2019m handsome.\u201dGao Qi\u2019s expression was complicated, but his tone was dull. It looked like the poison had penetrated into him rather deeply.922: \u201c?\u201dThe process of card drawing was as usual.922 fanned it out. His eyes swept back and forth between You Huo and Qin Jiu, and said: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go first?\u201dHe said to You Huo: \u201cI\u2019m sure you won\u2019t be unlucky enough to get another good student card.\u201d\u201cGood student card?\u201d Zhao Jiatong suddenly spoke up: \u201cAre you talking about the cards like \u2018Top Student\u2019?\u201d922: \u201cYeah, what else could it be?\u201dFor some reason, Zhao Jiatong was actually very interested in those useless cards.She asked You Huo: \u201cWhat did he mean just now? You already have three cards?\u201dYou Huo was a little surprised. He slowly nodded.Zhao Jiatong continued: \u201cThat good? Are all three different?\u201dThat\u2026\u2026.good?You Huo didn\u2019t understand: \u201cAre you being sarcastic when you\u2019re saying that its good?\u201dZhao Jiatong wanted to roll her eyes but because of her habit, she didn\u2019t dare do it in front of A: \u201cI meant it literally. I usually would only be sarcastic towards Gao Qi.\u201dGao Qi who was named looked up and met with You Huo and Qin Jiu\u2019s eyes. He quickly looked away.After a while, he suddenly realised that it wasn\u2019t right. The one who got together with their enemy wasn\u2019t me! Why am I the one feeling guilty?!\u201cYou guys\u2026\u2026..Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know how to use the good student card?\u201d Zhao Jiatong finally realised.922 looked at Qin Jiu and then at 154: \u201cWe don\u2019t know. We have always thought that it was an encouragement card, like a thank you come again sort of thing.\u201d\u201cOf course, that\u2019s not it. But it\u2019s true that no one has used this card for a long time so it\u2019s normal not to know.\u201d As one of the initial invigilators, Zhao Jiatong knew more about some things compared to the others.She said, \u201cThere are three types of good student cards; Outstanding Examinee, Amazing Student and Top Student. When you get one of each, you can get a reward.\u201d\u201cWhat reward.\u201d\u201cFreedom to form a team.\u201d Zhao Jiatong said: \u201cYou can choose your own teammates and decide who you want to enter an examination centre with. There is no limit on the number of examinees.\u201dHearing this, You Huo and Qin Jiu finally showed some interest.\u201cNo limit? How many times can it be used?\u201d\u201cNonsense. Of course, it can only be used once.\u201d Zhao Jiatong said: \u201cSo do you have all three?\u201d\u201cNo. Two of the three are duplicates.\u201d You Huo said: \u201cI only have Top Student and Outstanding Examinee.\u201dZhao Jiatong had a look of disappointment.You Huo wondered: \u201cYou said that it hasn\u2019t been used in a long time. How is that possible?\u201dThe ability to form teams freely was definitely something very tempting. After taking an exam, you find out who is reliable, who is unreliable, who is strong and who is weak.With the team forming reward, they could gather all the strong characters together and sweep through the exam in an instant.So how was it possible for it not to be used in a long time?\u201cIt requires gathering three cards. That\u2019s very difficult.\u201d\u201cDifficult? There are at least 10 of those cards here. There are more of them compared to the others.\u201d You Huo pointed at the cards in 922\u2019s hands.\u201cThe total amount may be more, but you can get 922 to show you afterwards. Among those 10 cards, 6 are Top Student cards, 3 are Outstanding Examinee cards and only one is Amazing Student.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s still not bad. Just draw a few more times.\u201d\u201cMy god\u2026\u2026Do you realise how difficult it is for ordinary examinees to get the opportunity to draw cards? Over the past four months, I have only met one person and that\u2019s you.\u201d\u201cA long time ago, in order to get those three cards, many people would try their luck at the casino with their points. But the cards in the casino back then was completely different compared to now and good student cards were extremely rare.\u201dBecause it was difficult to get a drawing chance and because was difficult to collect all three, over time everyone gradually forgot about it.The ability to freely form a team was indeed very tempting.For the first time, You Huo hoped that his luck would be the same as before so that he would draw another good student card.But the heavens didn\u2019t answer his wishes. He reached out and drew\u2026\u2026.A Guaranteed Pass.922: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWasn\u2019t your luck supposed to be horribly bad???\u3010Examinee You Huo has used one drawing opportunity!!\u3011The systems voice was calm, but it carried a hint of crazed ecstasy.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: HAHAHA The system is trying to kick him outAlso, poor Gao Qi.

This means that the examinee possesses unrivalled skills and enviable luck. The Guaranteed Pass card allows the examinee to clear the examination without taking the remaining exams.\u3011Hearing this, the other examinees were extremely envious. They all started discussing the card.\u201cThat luck is amazing! A Guaranteed Pass!\u201d\u201cI thought that card only existed in legends. I have never seen it before.\u201d\u201cI saw it!\u201d\u201cSeriously?\u201d\u201cReally! During my first exam \u2013 it was probably an international exam because there were lots of foreign examinees \u2013 a Russian woman drew one.\u201d\u201cAnd then?\u201d\u201cAnd then? Of course, she used it immediately. After clearing the examination, she went home.\u201d\u201cHome\u2026\u2026\u2026How nice.\u201dSounds of quiet discussions from their end travelled over.The crow sitting atop of a sculpture raised its head. Its bead eyes looked around in a proud and determined manner.Everything that happens inside the system is recorded. This naturally includes the drawing rate and usage of Guaranteed Pass cards. According its most trusted data and its analysis of it, there was only one result \u2014\u2014\u2013After all the exams it had conducted globally, a total of 116 examinees had drawn the Guaranteed Pass card. Every one of those cases had used the card soon after it was drawn. The average time it took was 5 seconds.During those 5 seconds, they either jumped with joy, screamed or went crazy.In other words, the instant usage rate of this ace card was 100%Who could refuse such a temptation?No one could!The crow tilted its head and asked while looking down from above:\u3010Examinee You Huo, you can now use this extremely valuable Guaranteed Pass card.\u3011Please read this from KKTranslates. If it\u2019s on another site, it was stolen. Please don\u2019t support those thieves, the translator KK is going to cry\u2026You Huo however just answered with one word: \u201cNo.\u201dCrow: \u201c???\u201d\u201cWhether or not I use it is up to me, right?\u201d You Huo asked 154.\u201cHuh? Oh, yeah. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d 154 said, \u201cYou can choose to use it anytime as long as the rules allow it.\u201dYou Huo stuffed the card into his pocket.154 covered his mouth and said to 922: \u201cI think it might die from anger.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cThe system.\u201d922 glanced at the crow and had the urge to laugh but he used all his life\u2019s worth of willpower to restrain himself. He then turned around and saw Miss 021 secretly pinching her own hand. Looks like she was also having a hard time holding it in.922 said to Qin Jiu: \u201cBoss, draw a card.\u201dThings like luck is a very strange thing. The good would usually come with the good, while the bad would usually come with the bad.You Huo had just drawn a Guaranteed Pass card and Qin Jiu followed with an Exemption card.The additional information written on the card was very impactful:>Two people, two exams>Examinees who have drawn the Exemption card can be exempted from a corresponding number of exams. The scores for the exempted exams will be the average scores. You are a very lucky child. Exemption cards are very rare and double exemption cards are even rarer. They are practically half a Guaranteed Pass card. Do you have a precious partner? Do you have a close friend? You can share this luck with them.The crow which had been sitting on the sculpture suddenly came alive again.Two people! Two exams!To people who had just started the examination, this card would probably be just an exam exemption card but for the examinees in this exam, it held a completely different meaning.The people here had already taken three exams. According to the existing examination structure, they only had two exams left.If this Exempt card was used, it was no different from a Guaranteed Pass card.And it even guaranteed two to pass.So, what does this mean?It meant that those people can finally get lost\u2014\u2014\u2013You Huo would once again be removed.And Qin Jiu would return to his invigilator role.The crow opened its mouth\u2014\u2013But in the end Qin Jiu did something even more impactful.He exchanged a look with You Huo and turned around and gave the card away.In a deck, there was only one guaranteed pass card. The young couple who was finally able to be reunited would naturally be unwilling to separate.But this Exemption card was different.Qin Jiu gave the card to Zhou Qi and Jiang Yuan and said jokingly: \u201cYour wedding gift. From me and that\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201dHe pointed back with his thumb: \u201c\u2014\u2014that guy there that\u2019s pretending that this has nothing to do with him.\u201dZhou Qi looked over. You Huo was standing not far away waiting. The moment their eyes met, she was stunned, and she slowly gave him a polite nod.He wasn\u2019t very friendly or talkative.But she knew that that person there is a good person.The one before her is the same.\u201cThis card is definitely something very valuable.\u201d Zhou Qi shook her head: \u201cYou should use it yourself. This is what you deserve. We really can\u2019t accept it. In any case, we only have two exams left. We will work hard until the end.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t use it. Even if we keep it, it\u2019ll be a waste.\u201dZhou Qi didn\u2019t understand: \u201cWhy?\u201dBecause their official matters weren\u2019t over. Their private matters too.Because of both these reasons, it wasn\u2019t time for them to leave.\u201cHaven\u2019t had enough fun.\u201d Qin Jiu said to Zhou Qi.He tucked the card into Jiang Yuan\u2019s chest pocket and patted the other party\u2019s shoulder: \u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d***Everyone else got onto the carriages one after another.Only then 922 pulled Qin Jiu aside: \u201cBoss, just a second.\u201dHe specially picked a spot away from the carriages and stopped next to a sculpture: \u201cIt\u2019s like this\u2026\u2026.We just received a violation notice. It was a very strange.\u201dQin Jiu raised an eyebrow. He didn\u2019t look surprised.922 internally wondered if it was really true.\u201cHow was it strange? Tell me.\u201d\u201cThe notice was blank. There wasn\u2019t anything on it but when 154 checked the violation details, we got some additional information.\u201dQin Jiu nodded to indicate for him to continue.922: \u201cUh\u2026\u2026The violator was you and the violation\u2026..it was a little vague. One moment it said system security threat and another moment it said\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201cSaid what?\u201d\u201cSaid\u2026\u2026..\u201d922 scratched his head. He suddenly poked 154\u2019s waist.154 jumped forward like he had received an electric shock. He found himself standing in front of Qin Jiu.922: \u201c154 will give you the details!\u201d154: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dFuck your mum.922 and Miss 021 both took a step back at the same time to give him the centre position.154 maintained a deadpanned expression and said slowly: \u201cIt said that you and an examinee had developed an\u2026\u2026. relationship.\u201d\u201cWhat relationship?\u201d Qin Jiu wasn\u2019t angry: \u201cI couldn\u2019t catch it through your mumbling.\u201d154 rolled his eyes. He mustered up his courage: \u201cAn improper relationship.\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesWhen he was done, he quickly added: \u201cBut this only appeared momentarily and then it disappeared. I checked again just now and the violation section is empty again. Maybe there was a problem with the system. Afterall\u2026\u2026.it\u2019s way of thinking can be a little biased.\u201dAs he spoke, he turned to look at 922 and 021 before looking back at Qin Jiu: \u201cWe all think it was probably just a mistake.\u201dQin Jiu let out an \u201coh\u201d.When 154 was about to continue, Qin Jiu suddenly said: \u201cIt\u2019s not really a mistake.\u201d154: \u201c?\u201dWhen he realised the meaning of his words two seconds later, he closed his mouth again.Everyone was silent.922 was dumbfounded. 021\u2019s pretty eyes were wide with shock.\u201cSo, what did you want to say?\u201d Qin Jiu didn\u2019t pay attention to the wellbeing of the three people\u2019s hearts and said to 154: \u201cContinue.\u201dContinue my ass.154 thought this.His mouth opened and closed several times before he was able to force out: \u201cI originally wanted to say\u2026\u2026\u2026Boss you won\u2019t be able to return to the rest stop for the time being. You will need to come with us back to the invigilator\u2019s district to go through the violation clearance procedure and remove the incorrect record but\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t a mistake, then there\u2019s no need for it to be removed.\u201d 021 helped him finish his words, \u201cMust be punished according to the rules.\u201dWhen the system issued this rule, it followed the principle of maintaining one\u2019s privacy. Only the invigilator was to be punished and they would be punished relatively secretly \u2014\u2014 Apart from 154, 922 and 021, the other invigilators wouldn\u2019t know about it.As for the examinee, as a default the system wouldn\u2019t reveal or follow up on it unless the examinee themselves insisted.And so, 021 didn\u2019t ask but her curiosity was at its peak.She secretly glanced at Qin Jiu but saw that he didn\u2019t have any intention to name the examinee. He just nodded: \u201cAlright. Let\u2019s go back first then.\u201dAs a woman who is rather sensitive to one\u2019s thoughts, she could tell that his act of avoidance was his way of respecting and protecting the other party.This surprised her.She had always believed that Qin Jiu was a frivolous man. People like this would often act recklessly and unrestrainedly.Unexpectedly, he didn\u2019t do that.021 even surprisingly understood the examinee a little.Putting aside prejudices, this kind of person with both confidence and rationality was indeed\u2026\u2026\u2026something quite attractive.021 patted her head and silently wore her sunglasses.922 scratched his head while hesitating to speak. For a moment, he looked like a big monkey.After holding it back for a long time, he eventually reached his limit.\u201cThis isn\u2019t fair!\u201d 922 exclaimed.\u201cWhat\u2019s not fair?\u201d Qin Jiu glanced at him.\u201cBoss, it\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know. The unlucky one in this situation is always the invigilator.\u201d 922 didn\u2019t like his boss getting the short end of the stick and muttered: \u201cThere are also plenty of people in the invigilator\u2019s place. Why did you have to go and fall for an examinee?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s more, it has only been a few days. Is that examinee an celestial beauty or something for you to be attracted\u2026\u2026..\u201d922 didn\u2019t dare say this to Qin Jiu. He could only slow down his pace to fall in line with 154 and 021 who were behind them to complain.Just as the three of them were about to keep up with Qin Jiu, they suddenly heard rustling sounds behind them.021\u2019s shoulder was patted.She turned her head and saw that it was You Huo.\u201cDidn\u2019t you get on the carriage???\u201dQin Jiu who was walking ahead heard the sound and looked back.You Huo lifted his chin and used it to point at him: \u201cSaw that someone was missing and got off.\u201d922 was a little worried about his boss\u2019s reputation: \u201cWhen did you come? Did you hear us talking?\u201dYou Huo retracted his gaze and glanced at him: \u201cAbout half.\u201d\u201cRegardless of how much you heard, don\u2019t tell\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201d Halfway through his words, 922 suddenly realised that You Huo who was normally too lazy to even speak probably wouldn\u2019t go around gossiping so he relaxed, \u201cForget it\u2026\u2026.Anyway, boss will need to go back with us to the invigilator\u2019s district and if nothing else happens he will go to the rest stop afterwards. You should get on the carriage first.\u201dThere was still a large blood stain on his shirt. 021 couldn\u2019t stand the sight of it so she also pushed her sunglasses up and said: \u201cThe carriage is about to leave. Hurry and go.\u201dIn the distance, dark carriages carrying examinees started to set off. One after another, they left the examination centre.You Huo looked over for a moment before turning back.\u201cI\u2019ll go this way.\u201d He said this and started walking.With his tall height and long legs, he soon walked a distance from them.The three invigilators watched his back stunned for a few seconds and hurried over.021 said: \u201cWhy are you going with us? We\u2019re going to the invigilator\u2019s district.\u201dYou Huo stopped and turned around. His voice was calm and indifferent: \u201cOnly one party gets punished for improper relationship?\u201d\u201cYeah! Isn\u2019t it unfair?\u201d922 subconsciously replied.The next moment, this little fool stepped onto his brakes: \u201cFuck.\u201dThe three examinees suddenly understood what he meant.922 and 154 stood there like they had just been struck by lightning.

    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Global University Entrance ExaminationChapter 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBloody CarnivalChapter 96: Special Sector3:16pm, Twin Towers.The three elevators in the punishment building were still operating normally; one had a blue light, and another had a red light.The former was for examinees, and the latter was for invigilators. The elevators take them to different locations.In addition to those, there was also one with a white light.To the majority of the invigilators, that elevator with the white light is very specialIt would usually remain in a \u201csleeping\u201d state all year round and would always be stopped at the first floor because the opportunity to use it was few and far between.At this moment, 078 was standing in front of an elevator door holding a notice in his hand.He had taken a few days of sick leave.After getting better in the morning, he received this notice.The notice wrote\u2026\u2026\u2026922 had twisted his foot, 021 felt dizzy and uncomfortable because of a sudden episode of low blood sugar and 154 had several mouth ulcers from overworking. As the three urgently require rest to recover, 078 who is in the same group is required to take over the job of punishing the rule violating examinees.The first thought that appeared in his mind when he saw this notice was: What kind of bullshit is this?!Twisting a foot was fine. Afterall, 922 is indeed rather sloppy. It is said that the road to the examination centre was quite rough and he heard they even needed to use horse carriages. Something like accidentally missing his step and twisting his foot was indeed something he would do.But suddenly having low blood sugar\u2026\u2026\u2026Miss 021 came from the military and her physical fitness is better than most men so how the hell could she suddenly have low blood sugar???But\u2026\u2026he didn\u2019t dare provoke this ancestor of his so if she says she dizzy, then he would leave it at that.As for 154\u2026\u2026This one here was really taking it too far.It was just a couple of ulcers and it wasn\u2019t on the sole of his feet. It wouldn\u2019t be to the extent of being unable to take the examinees to be punished. Did he really need that urgent rest???Yet the system actually accepted this ridiculous request for leave.078 even suspected that 154 may have pulled some strings.But what surprised him the most was the punishment location.It wrote that he needed to board this elevator.\u201cHuh? Hey, you\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201d An invigilator on duty who was responsible for watching over the building was surprised to see 078 standing there: \u201cWhat are you doing standing there? Did you accidentally stand in front of the wrong one? That\u2019s the Special Punishment Sector.\u201dSpecial Punishment Sector.That was basically all that they knew about the elevator with the white light.As for what specific rule violations it covered, they didn\u2019t know.It is said that it deals with issues specifically related to the system\u2019s security, but no one knew whether this was true. Afterall, the sample data they could refer to was almost zero.078 waved his notice and said: \u201cI didn\u2019t make a mistake. It\u2019s clearly written here.\u201dThat invigilator was surprised. He moved closer and took a look: \u201cWow, which exam was this? All the invigilators retired? That\u2019s impossible.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible. I retired after the end of my last one.\u201d 078 pointed at his haggard face.The other invigilator was at loss for words.The notice didn\u2019t mention the violator nor reveal any details regarding the violation.Please read this from kk translatesBut 078 could already guess who it could be.Sure enough, less than a few minutes later those two gods of misfortune arrived.\u201cThey\u2019re here. You can go and report to 021 and the others later.\u201d The invigilator who brought them over acted like he was delivering a landmine. He turned around and fled as soon as he was done.078 didn\u2019t have the chance to stop him.He looked at the two with a complicated expression.Qin Jiu raised his hand and greeted: \u201cGood afternoon.\u201dGood my ass.078 internally muttered that it had turned bad after seeing those two.\u201cWhat did you two do again this time?\u201d 078 asked frustratedly: \u201cYou\u2019re even using this elevator now.\u201dWhen he asked \u201cwhat did you two do\u201d, the atmosphere turned a little strange.But 078 who was rather slow didn\u2019t notice this.Qin Jiu looked at the elevator light and was a little surprised: \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d 078 muttered, \u201cWould I just casually shove people on?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this elevator?\u201d You Huo asked.He was a little curious last time and thought it was for those reserve invigilators like the bus driver and shop owners. He didn\u2019t expect himself to be able to use it.Qin Jiu briefly gave him an explanation. The elevator then took them upstairs.It was so fast; it was quite unexpected.The place the elevator stopped at was at a large empty floor. Like the one last time, there was also a registration panel.What was different, however, was that there was no one manning this station and the large French window at the end was replaced by a thick, metal door.\u3010Special Sector. Permission required to enter. Please show the relevant notice.\u3011078 took out the notice and went over to the registration desk.When he saw the metal door, You Huo had a feeling of deja vu.He was now no stranger to this feeling.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Qin Jiu asked in a low voice.You Huo said: \u201cLooks familiar. May have been here before.\u201dThere were two possible ways: Coming as a violator or coming as an invigilator.078 was busy verifying at the desk in the distance.The system would sound again and again in response.Qin Jiu watched 078\u2019s back and suddenly said: \u201cI saw your old violation records after we finished the cleaning task last time.\u201dYou Huo looked over at him.\u201cThere was one in there that said that you once had an overly intimate relationship with someone.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..Who?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Qin Jiu said.The system still maintained a strong influence over the invigilators. Even now, his memory was firmly suppressed and not a clue was leaked.He lowered his head and asked You Huo: \u201cDo you have an impression Big Invigilator?\u201dYou Huo suddenly recalled the fragmented scene that flashed through his mind when he had his back pressed against the fence and was kissed into confusion by Qin Jiu.In that scene, someone was standing behind him. That person said\u2026\u2026 Other invigilators and examinees don\u2019t sleep together.When You Huo heard the same voice next to his ear, his lips moved a little.\u201cNo.\u201d He said.\u201cReally nothing?\u201d Qin Jiu asked again.\u201cReally.\u201dQin Jiu\u2019s eyes fell onto his side profile.You Huo leaned against the wall staring at 078 in the distance. Thin lines stretched from his chin down to his neck.Suddenly, a rather naughty finger reached out and tugged his earlobe.\u201cThen what were you thinking about when you paused just now?\u201d Qin Jiu asked.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe remained silent for a few seconds and answered: \u201cWondering how long 078 is going to take getting the verification sorted.\u201dHe didn\u2019t suppress his voice this time.The invigilator who was suddenly named said awkwardly: \u201cI haven\u2019t been here before so I\u2019m not familiar with how it works. Do you know how 001?\u201dQin Jiu looked at him expressionlessly.078: \u201cOh right, you probably forgot.\u201d\u201cThere used to be someone in charge here so there was no need to do it ourselves.\u201d Qin Jiu walked over.\u201cWhere is that person now?\u201d You Huo asked.\u201cWas sent away.\u201d Qin Jiu said, \u201cSpeaking of which, you have probably met her. She was sent over to the rest stop.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve met? Who?\u201d\u201cCalled Chu Yue, the rest stop hotel manager.\u201dYou Huo was stunned.He really did meet her. He met here after the end of his first exam. That Boss Chu even made an exception and cooked up some dumplings for them.078 scratched his head.He had pressed a few wrong places on the panel and the interface was now a mess.He didn\u2019t know what he had pressed earlier for the interface to suddenly change. It now displayed a very short list.It was a checkin-checkout record.Looking at the time in the first column, the first record was about three or four years ago and the time span was about a year between the first and the second record.There was only one page of the records there. It could be seen that this place was indeed very rarely used.The listed included the violator, the accompanying invigilator and the person in charge.There were many unfamiliar names and code names, but Invigilator A would appear several times and Chu Yue\u2019s name would be on all of them.You Huo suddenly remembered the message he left with 021. He had said that he needed to go find someone at the rest stop.Although he had only been to a rest stop twice and have only met a handful of people\u2026.But there was something called intuition.He intuitively felt that\u2026.the person he needed to look for was probably Chu Yue.Just as Qin Jiu wanted to turn to another page, the system sounded.Perhaps it couldn\u2019t bear watching 078 muck around, three screens automatically appeared on the panel for 078 to verify one by one.The information was verified.The tightly guarded metal door finally opened. A gust of wind carrying a strong smell rushed over.It smelt like a machine room that had not been used for a long time.The moment he smelt this, You Huo\u2019s footsteps stopped.Please read this from kk translatesHe could almost hear a woman speaking beside him. That voice was the same as Boss Chu\u2019s voice.\u2026\u2026\u2026078 almost ran into him. He asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d You Huo said.He just suddenly remembered something.***Behind the metal door was also a security gate. All violators would have to go through it for a secondary verification.That year, Chu Yue\u2019s hair was longer than it was now, and she would always tie it up before she had to do anything.That day, she was biting onto a hair tie and combing back her hair with her fingers when she received a violation notice.The violation notice was very detailed, completely different from now.Both the violator name and violation was written on the notice.Rule Violator: AViolation: Overly intimate relationship with Examinee Qin Jiu.Remark: The examinee is an outsider with an evaluated danger level of S and Invigilator A is a core system personnel. Their relationship threatens system security.Punishment: White light district (1 times)Other: At the request of A, the punishment has been postponed for 5 days.Chu Yue stared at those lines and then proceeded to quickly tie up her hair.She looked over at the young head invigilator who was already standing at the security gate and walked over: \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that the system is very biased. You asked for it to be postponed and it really did postpone it.\u201dHe snorted: \u201cPostponing it for five days brings more benefit than harm so why wouldn\u2019t it agree.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Chu Yue nodded. She scanned her finger on the security gate.\u201cStop crossing your arms and leaning on the door.\u201d Chu Yue said.Because of certain reasons and also because she is of a rather special standing, she was the only person in the entire invigilator district who could talk to Invigilator A like this.With the accompaniment of several electronic sounds, the security gate processed the information.Chu Yue suddenly asked: \u201cSo that guy left?\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d\u201cHow did you convince him?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t convince.\u201d\u201cPretty stubborn.\u201d Chu Yue muttered, \u201cThen how did he leave?\u201d\u201cReached the re-examination limit.\u201d A said, \u201cForcefully ended by the system.\u201dThe young invigilator\u2019s thin eyelids hung low and his tone was indifferent.But Chu Yue could tell that he wasn\u2019t in a good mood.In fact, he would usually have a cold expression and look like he was always in a bad mood. Most people wouldn\u2019t notice the subtle changes.Only Chu Yue who knew some things could detect these changes.\u201cBut I can\u2019t believe you.\u201d Chu Yue puffed her cheeks and said angrily: \u201cYou postponed the punishment until after he left.\u201dFollowing the instructions, A raised both his hands and turned around. He acted like he didn\u2019t hear her.He had always been like this. Chu Yu had long grown used to it.With her character, she didn\u2019t like to meddle with other people\u2019s private affairs.But today was an exception. She felt that she had to say something to A.Hiding something yourself and being forced to conceal something were two different things. No one liked to hide away the things they liked; forever unable to let others know, unable to reveal anything, unable to lower their guard.No one would want that.\u201cWhat if. I\u2019m saying what if.\u201d Chu Yue said in a deliberately nonchalant manner: \u201cWhat if that person comes back? If he knew that you took the punishment for the both of you, I think\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dA\u2019s voice was calm and certain: \u201cThere\u2019s no what ifs. The system will definitely implement measures after sending him out.\u201dChu Yue said: \u201cHey, it\u2019s just a hypothetical question.\u201dA no longer spoke.After the verification at the security gate was done, the door to the punishment location finally opened.A picked up his coat, bid her farewell and walked in.Light penetrating through the white fog filled the entrance. Chu Yue stood next to the fog with her finger resting on a button in preparation to close the door after him.That figure wearing the uniform was tall and lean. Countless women have turned their heads whenever he walked past.Chu Yue suddenly sighed emotionally: \u201cIt\u2019s quite amazing. You actually could like someone.\u201dA\u2019s footsteps stopped. He glanced over at Chu Yue and didn\u2019t refute.Soon afterwards, he stepped into the fog.A month later, the person he believed would never appear again had returned and, this time, he appeared before him as an invigilator.***\u3010Qin Jiu, current identity is an examinee.\u3011\u3010You Huo, current identity is an examinee.\u3011\u3010Basic conditions for security threat not met. Special Sector cannot be opened. Punishment cannot be executed.\u3011You Huo returned to his senses.He and Qin Jiu followed behind 078 and walked through the security gate again.The result was the same as before. It sounded on par to the system slapping itself in the face twice.078 looked at the notice dumbfounded.He knew that the system liked to emphasise rules. It rigidly believed that it can follow all the rules and is hence superior to the irrational humans.Who would have thought that there would be a day where it would slap itself in the face?After the results were reported, the security gate started to emit white smoke.It was unknown if it was due to the machine malfunctioning or because of the systems anger.Despite coming all the way here for nothing, 078 wasn\u2019t upset. He was glad that he was finally able to send these two gods of misfortunes away.He said with a \u2018setting all humanity free\u2019 tone: \u201cI\u2019ll take you back to the rest stop.\u201dYou Huo suddenly asked: \u201cCan I pick the rest stop?\u201dBefore 078 could speak, the system answered first: \u201cNo!! It\u2019s random!!!\u201dIts voice echoed through the entire floor.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Yay Boss Chu!

With the others already gone, they were merely following after them.The heavens had never answered \u2018Lucky\u2019 You Huo\u2019s wishes, and it was the same this time too.It wasn\u2019t the old and tattered rest stop Chu Yue managed; it was the complete opposite \u2013 an extremely prosperous city.\u201cOh! Congratulations, you managed to be assigned to one of the best rest stops.\u201d 078 rubbed his hands together as soon as he entered the rest stop.You Huo wasn\u2019t pleased.There were only five rest stops in total. Was it really necessary to say \u201cone of the best\u201d?Qin Jiu however was in a good mood. He patted You Huo\u2019s shoulder and pointed at a place bustling with people in the distance: \u201cYou see that tower? Try and guess what it is.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026.Casino.\u201dQin Jiu said with praise: \u201cOur Big Invigilator is very clever.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dAre you being serious?The top of the tower was a pyramid with a lightning shaped rod pointing up to the sky. Hanging from it was a string of dice and on the four corners around the tower were large $ symbols.Only the mentally disabled wouldn\u2019t be able to tell that it\u2019s a casino.But speaking of casinos\u2026\u2026.You Huo recalled the things the driver from the Gypsy exam mentioned.He asked Qin Jiu: \u201cYou can draw cards at the casino? Things like Guaranteed Pass are there?\u201dQin Jiu nodded. Just as he was about to speak, 078 spoke first: \u201cWho told you that? That person must not have been in the casino before.\u201dYou Huo turned to look at him: \u201cYou have?\u201d078 cleared his throat: \u201cThis is my favourite rest stop.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know you liked this sort of excitement.\u201d Qin Jiu said.078 didn\u2019t know if he was being serious or if he was mocking him.\u201cAnyway, there are indeed good cards at the casino. Things like Postpone, Exemption, Bonus Points\u2026\u2026If you\u2019re lucky enough, you can get your hands on a couple of them. As for Guaranteed Pass, don\u2019t keeps your hopes up.\u201d078 hadn\u2019t met up with the other three invigilators so he didn\u2019t know of You Huo and Qin Jiu\u2019s card situation. He just knew that these two have always had bad luck.\u201cThink about it. Who wouldn\u2019t immediately use the card once they get the Guaranteed Pass card? That is a top ace card so what\u2019s the point of bringing it to the casino to be exchanged? That\u2019s unless someone gets two draw opportunities in an exam and draws two of them at the same time\u2026. but that\u2019s even more impossible because there\u2019s only one of them in each deck.\u201d 078 shook his head as he spoke.He didn\u2019t notice You Huo\u2019s expression and just said sincerely: \u201cAs someone who has been there before, let me give you a warning. Don\u2019t indulge yourself in the casino. Once you\u2019ve had enough, get out before you delve too deeply. Also, don\u2019t even think about getting a Guaranteed Pass.\u201dYou Huo expressionlessly pulled out a card from his pocket: \u201cWe don\u2019t plan on getting a Guaranteed Pass. We plan on giving it. Are we stupid?\u201d078: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe slapped himself and quickly ran off.Qin Jiu leaned against a lamppost and stared at You Huo\u2019s side profile with a smile on his face.\u201cAm I funny to look at?\u201d The handsome guy asked icily.Qin Jiu answered: \u201cNo. I just felt that when our Mr. A uses profanities, it\u2019s very\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe paused.You Huo waited for him to finish.Qin Jiu narrowed his eyes: \u201cVery sexy.\u201dYou Huo was rendered speechless.He looked at Qin Jiu from head to toe and suddenly responded: \u201cNot as sexy as you.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c?\u201dProbably because he didn\u2019t expect the other party to throw that line back at him, he stood there stunned for a while.When he returned to his senses, You Huo had already brushed past him and walked ahead.***This rest stop really was bustling with people.This time, this wasn\u2019t sarcasm.You Huo pointed at the cars and people passing by and asked Qin Jiu: \u201cAre these real people or NPCs?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cHalf-half I guess.\u201dPlease read this from kk translates\u201cHalf?\u201d You Huo was surprised, \u201cWhere do all these people come from?\u201d\u201cMost of the examinees from this country are concentrated here.\u201d\u201cIf I remember correctly, someone said that for a period of time only examinees from the same examination centre can enter the same rest stop?\u201d\u201cYes, but this place is an exception.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause of that casino.\u201dQin Jiu pointed at the tower that was getting closer and closer, \u201cThere are many things that can be exchanged in there. Everything you can think of, and everything you can\u2019t think of. For example, cards. If you combine some of the cards, it can help postpone the next exam and buy more time for the examinee.\u201dOne month, two months.One year, two years.Here, houses and cars are not as valuable as good cards so it\u2019s easy to get.Once you start living here, you become less willing to take the risk of doing the next exam.And so, more and more examinees remain.And, inevitably, examinees from different exams would intermingle.\u201cBecause the exams are different, the examinees here can exchange and sell information.\u201d Qin Jiu said, \u201cThat is also the reason why many people choose to stay here.\u201dThere was a psychological effect \u2014\u2014- After collecting ten sources of information, they would worry that they would end up in the eleventh examination centre. After collecting 100 sources of information, they would worry that the system would have 1000 different examination centres waiting for them.Constantly worried that they missed something, constantly thinking that it wasn\u2019t enough\u2026.And so, it became difficult to leave this place.\u201cIsn\u2019t it ridiculous?\u201d Qin Jiu asked.He didn\u2019t ask this mockingly and was just expressing his thoughts.\u201cIt\u2019s understandable.\u201d You Huo thought for a while and said, \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s a problem with the system\u2026\u2026\u2026Why are you looking at me like that?\u201dQin Jiu said: \u201cNo reason. How should I put it\u2026\u2026\u2026People like you are very rare.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cHow so?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cFrom the beginning to the end, you firmly believe that the system is repulsive. People like that are rare. Most would have been swayed by it.\u201d\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s possible.\u201d Qin Jiu said: \u201cDon\u2019t you think the system is sometimes stupid and na\u00efve?\u201dYou Huo understood what he was trying to say.Most people are soft-hearted by nature. Sometimes they are rendered speechless by the stupid things done by the system and would temporarily forget about its cruelty.Once or twice was okay but what about ten or twenty times?Or even\u2026\u2026..a hundred or a thousand times?Those who have stayed here for a long time \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 The examinees and invigilators who have been here for while would probably go through something like this every day.Not to mention, the system would also occasionally give them some \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d and \u201creward.\u201dGao Qi had said before that early invigilators used to be divided into the gentle faction and the forceful faction because some early invigilators still held some feelings towards the system.At that time, You Huo couldn\u2019t comprehend it.He couldn\u2019t understand why a gentle faction would exist. He couldn\u2019t understand why people would be soft-hearted towards the system and think that it could be put back on track.But now, he understood.It was difficult to say whether the system was doing it intentionally or unintentionally.But it indeed seems to be a little confused.If it was done intentionally then that really\u2026\u2026..is a little scary.***This great master finally had something to ponder over but unfortunately it couldn\u2019t last more than twenty minutes.It was because the casino was really too noisy.Just after receiving their number plate and entering through the door, loud cheering attacked You Huo\u2019s ears.In an environment like this, you could only rely on shouting or speaking into the other person\u2019s ear to communicate.The two of them are lazy so shouting wasn\u2019t an option. They naturally chose the latter.Former invigilator 001 acted like a tour guide. He explained into You Huo\u2019s ear: \u201cThe first and second floor are for points. You can use your points to bet; if you win you earn points, if you lose you lose points. Many people try to maximise their points before an exam for more stability during an exam.\u201dThat loud cheering earlier was because someone had won 26 points.That man celebrated for a while and then returned to the table.You Huo wondered: \u201cDoesn\u2019t he know that he should walk away now?\u201dQin Jiu said: \u201cIt\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t know. There\u2019s a rule.\u201d\u201cWhat rule?\u201d\u201cYou must play three games at a time.\u201dThe next second the person who won 26 points lost 19 points in an instant.After patting his chest to pump himself up, he returned to the table a third time.They passed through an arch and headed upstairs.The third floor was also very lively, but the atmosphere here was slightly different.Qin Jiu said: \u201cThis is for money.\u201d\u201cMoney?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not money in a literal sense.\u201d Qin Jiu said, \u201cIt includes electronic transfers, houses, cars and anything else that represents money in real life.\u201d\u201cMoney is almost useless here. What\u2019s the point of gambling it?\u201d\u201cAs an outlet to vent.\u201d Qin Jiu answered: \u201cWill you easily bet a house in real life? You can over here. Gamble it out in three seconds and win it back in five seconds. It\u2019s an absurd venting outlet for some.\u201dIf the atmosphere on the first and second floors was extreme excitement and tension, the atmosphere here was pure catharsis; enjoyable but not tense.Please read this from kk translatesThey went up two more floors. Qin Jiu explained: \u201cHere is the card zone.\u201dThe level of tension here was in between the two earlier.The unique trait here was that there were only a limited number of people actually playing. Most were just watching from the sidelines.They were there to see what cards the others have and what kind of people their cards can attract.You Huo briefly looked around.\u201cInvigilator\u2019s Help\u201d, \u201cLast-minute Cramming\u201d, \u201cCheat Sheet\u201d etc accounted for most of the cards there.There were groups standing around seven or eight tables betting on first-class cards with instant effects like \u201cBonus 10 Points\u201d and \u201cCopy the Answer\u201d.There were also another two tables filled to the brim with people\u2026\u2026Without even looking, Qin Jiu knew: \u201cThat must be for exam exemption and postponement. Those two are the most popular here.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the place?\u201dThis examinee who had lost his memory was very daring. He immediately moved to approach the table but was quickly held back by Qin Jiu.\u201cWait, don\u2019t be in such a hurry.\u201d Qin Jiu said.He had reached out too quickly, so he didn\u2019t grab his wrist and had instead grabbed his fingers.You Huo lowered his eyes and glanced at it.Qin Jiu didn\u2019t immediately let go nor did he retract his hand.After a few seconds, the connected fingers naturally slipped away as their arms fell.You Huo rubbed his fingertips that still carried residual heat and tucked it inside his pocket. He looked around and asked Qin Jiu: \u201cWhy not? Is there something else?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not gambling here. We need to go up one more.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s upstairs?\u201d\u201cEverything.\u201d Qin Jiu said, \u201cCards, money, points, everything. We should be able to catch some mice up there.\u201dJust as Qin Jiu had said, half of the people here are real and the other half are system generated NPCs. This naturally included gamblers in the casino.The mice Qin Jiu referred to are those system generated NPCs.They don\u2019t take exams, so they don\u2019t really care for points and cards, let alone cars and houses.It wouldn\u2019t be a problem winning the cards from them.In the casino, those who go straight to a table are usually all veterans.Novices would usually look around for the first few days.But a novice with the surname You immediately took over a table. Qin Jiu followed behind him and leaned against it.Just with their appearances, both men were extremely eye-catching.But looks cannot be gambled.And so, everyone just looked over from the other gambling tables with no intention to come over.This continued until the dealer asked: \u201cWhat are you two betting on?\u201d\u201cCards.\u201d Qin Jiu said.There are many people gambling cards on this floor, but there weren\u2019t many good cards.With endless streams of people pulling out the \u201cHelp\u201d card, the veteran gamblers had already grown numb to it. Even just hearing the word \u201ccard\u201d made them want to snort.And they really did snort.The dealer was a standard NPC. Like the system, he just followed his usual procedures.He nodded unenthusiastically and didn\u2019t even look at You Huo: \u201cWhere\u2019s the card? Name the card and put it on the table.\u201dYou Huo let out a \u201cmhn\u201d and pulled the card out. He said calmly: \u201cGuaranteed Pass.\u201d\u201cGuaranteed what?\u201dThe dealer was only able to react a few seconds later. He looked over at the card dumbfounded.Qin Jiu snapped his finger and repeated with emphasis on each syllable: \u201cOne Guaranteed Pass card.\u201dThe entire floor instantly went quiet.After standing there frozen for a while, everyone stretched out their necks and looked over to check with their own eyes.Several minutes later, everyone in the casino had heard about two handsome men who had gone mad despite their young age. They had actually brought a \u201cGuaranteed Pass\u201d card over to gamble.In an instant, a crowd of people rushed over to the table You Huo and Qin Jiu sat at.The dealer who had never seen something like this before was so excited his voice shook.\u201cHow would the two gentlemen like to play?\u201d\u201cThe simplest one. Odd or even.\u201dThe dealer nodded: \u201cWell then\u2026\u2026.which gentlemen or lady would like to stand on this side?\u201dHe gestured to the spot opposite You Huo and Qin Jiu.All the real examinees in the casino started fight for the spot.The dealer hurried back to his corner and called out to You Huo from afar: \u201cIn a situation like this, you have the right to choose\u2014\u2014\u201dQin Jiu\u2019s eyes moved over everyone present and took in the things they held in their hands.Finally, he locked onto one.It was a very conspicuous mouse.And this mouse was standing there holding two good student cards trying to look calm.The moment Qin Jiu selected him; the entire audience went crazy.The dealer asked blankly: \u201cAre you here to do charity? There are so many good cards here including bonus 20 and bonus 30 point cards but you chose the worst one?\u201dMany examinees were calling out from the sidelines, but the two handsome men remained unmoved.The dealer took a few seconds to calm down. After calming down, he placed the dice in his cup.The extremely courageous Invigilator A for once didn\u2019t rush to the front line.He said to Qin Jiu: \u201cYou go.\u201dQin Jiu raised an eyebrow: \u201cYou trust me?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cDon\u2019t trust. Your luck is no better than mine.\u201dQin Jiu snorted: \u201cBut you still want me to gamble?\u201dYou Huo lifted his chin and motioned for him to go ahead.The examinees next to them who heard their conversation felt their hearts trembling.The dealer shook the cup and slammed it onto the table.Qin Jiu asked: \u201cDo you think it\u2019s odd or even?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cEven.\u201dQin Jiu nodded. He firmly placed his bet on odd.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThis is the correct way to use a \u2018lucky\u2019 Big Invigilator.(Please do not try this at home)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Only those who are not afraid of the invigilator\u2019s retaliation and are confident enough to tease him back can give it a try.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: The correct way to use You Huo HAHAPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They\u2019re definitely crazy.\u201d\u201cFucking hell. I came here to see two Gods of Luck use the Guaranteed Pass as a bait to win a whole heap of cards but this\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a Guaranteed Pass you know?!\u201dUnder the watch of countless eyes, You Huo passed the Guaranteed Pass card to the other end of the table.The NPC mouse acted very realistically. He jumped around in glee as if he was truly happy to receive the card.The dealer reminded: \u201cThree rounds must be played. The rule here is that the bets do not leave the table until all three rounds are over.\u201dThe bets placed on the table for the first game cannot be taken away. You can only add, and not subtract.This meant that the bets get larger as the games go on.This was also the reason why many become addicted to this. On one hand, it made it more exciting and, on the other hand, it always gave players hope that they could win it back.In an instant the mouse\u2019s cards had become three.One Outstanding Examinee, one Amazing Student and one Guaranteed Pass.You Huo and Qin Jiu\u2019s side was empty.The dealer made a \u2018please\u2019 gesture: \u201cDo the two of you have any other cards? You can take them out.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cNo.\u201dDealer: \u201cMoney, house, car, shop, building?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cNo.\u201dDealer: \u201c\u2026\u2026Then points?\u201dThat would do.\u201cBet mine first.\u201d Qin Jiu placed his card on the table.The card showed that he had completed three subjects and there was the word (Re-examination) after History. The points were recalculated following completion of the re-examination, so the total score now was 27.125 points.Those numbers were clearly displayed on the edge of the gambling table. The crowd of onlookers whispered for a while but weren\u2019t very surprised.If they knew that Qin Jiu started the third exam with negative points, they definitely wouldn\u2019t have this reaction.\u201cIn order to prevent any confusion with the rules, I will remind you again.\u201d The dealer said, \u201cBetting points at the points only area allow splitting of the points but here it is different. To make it more exciting, you will be betting all of it.\u201dQin Jiu nodded: \u201cOkay.\u201dThe mouse opposite them rubbed his hands eagerly.The dealer shook his cup again and slammed in onto the table.Qin Jiu asked \u2018Lucky\u2019 You Huo: \u201cBig Invigilator, odd or even?\u201d\u2018Lucky\u2019 You Huo had already grown numb to it: \u201cEven.\u201dQin Jiu said to the dealer: \u201cEven.\u201d\u2018Lucky\u2019 You Huo: \u201c?\u201dSeeing this rare confused expression of You Huo\u2019s, Qin Jiu laughed: \u201cGot a problem?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really going according to my guess? You\u2019ll have 0 points if we lose.\u201d You Huo said.Please read this from kk translates\u201cI\u2019ve even had negative points before so what\u2019s so scary about 0 points?\u201d Qin Jiu tapped his finger on the table and said jokingly: \u201cThis is a casino. We come here to take risks and gain instant wealth so you should also be prepared to go bankrupt.\u201dHe really was crazy.He was just like how he was back when he did 12 consecutive exams.It wasn\u2019t about struggling to survive, it was about staying around for as long as possible.Back then, it wasn\u2019t just Qin Jiu alone who had entered the system with a mission. There was actually a team but there weren\u2019t many. Firstly, it was because their lives weren\u2019t guaranteed and secondly, they were afraid of alerting the system.The team name was D. Their mission was to gain understanding of the system in all areas, try out different possibilities, test its boundaries and to find its hidden core control centre and destroy it.Some joked that it shouldn\u2019t be D and should be D-to-D; Dare to Die.However, the system had a self-protection program set up. Those who enter would gradually forget their past, forget about their purpose and forget why they were there. Qin Jiu also would only very occasionally remember let alone mention it.But he still did it very thoroughly.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cFuck!!!\u201d There was another outburst of chest thumping and feet stamping from the crowd.The onlookers anxiously hopped on their feet.This was because when the dealer lifted the cup:Odd.This time You Huo\u2019s luck had returned to normal.They had lost again.The dealer took Qin Jiu\u2019s card, swiped it on a machine on the table and the points in the card fell to 0.The mouse opposite them was extremely excited.With two games, the situation at the table had completely flipped.Who would have imagined that two good student cards could be used to gain a Guaranteed Pass and 27 points!\u201cThe third game.\u201d The dealer again made a \u2018please\u2019 gesture to You Huo and Qin Jiu.Although he was used to interacting with gamblers, but a situation like this was a first for him. Even his hand trembled a little.You Huo slapped his card onto the table without any hesitation.The information on the card was similar to Qin Jiu\u2019s; three subjects completed, and History was re-examined.But the points were shocking.42.125.When that number appeared at the edge of the table, the onlookers fell silent for a few seconds before bursting into excited whispers.Because of the need to bet all their points, most examinees who have a stable amount of points wouldn\u2019t come to this floor.No, to be more precise examinees who have a stable amount of points wouldn\u2019t even come to the casino!You fucking have more than forty points in three exams, is the top of the top in the A rank and even have a Guaranteed Pass. Why the hell are you here risking everything???Everyone\u2019s eyes had turned green with envy. Someone amongst the crowd even shouted: \u201cThose points. If you don\u2019t want it, can\u2019t you just give them to me?!\u201dThe atmosphere on this floor was at its peak.The mouse before them became even more excited because of this and he instantly dug out his card.The dealer supported the table and asked: \u201cWait a second, what is this for?\u201d\u201cRaising the bet!\u201d The mouse threw the card onto the table, \u201cThis is the most exciting game I\u2019ve played today so I\u2019m raising it! Add my points too!\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dHe asked Qin Jiu: \u201cThat\u2019s really an NPC?\u201d\u201cPretty realistic huh?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dCasino NPC\u2019s were all very realistic. The card was almost the same as an ordinary examinees with the front side displaying their room information and the back displaying their examination ticket details.It wrote that he had completed four subjects and had a total score of 40 points. It was very average.The dealer took the card, swiped it, added Qin Jiu\u2019s 27 points and then placed it on the betting table.The onlookers grew even more excited.Apart from those two good student cards, just picking out any of the point cards would make any examinee go crazy on the spot.The dealer started shaking the cup again.To raise the tension, this time he shook it for a very, very long time. Everything on the table depended on this third and final game.Qin Jiu picked up the card and looked at You Huo.Without needing to ask, You Huo said: \u201cI still think it\u2019s even.\u201dAfter saying that, he grabbed Qin Jiu\u2019s wrist and pressed his hand on \u201cOdd\u201d.This time, even the dealer was nervous.He took two deep breaths, grabbed the cup and looked around a few times. He then lifted the cup.Odd.Everyone on the floor was silent. They then all went crazy.The dealer was dumbfounded for a moment. After recovering, he pushed everything over to You Huo.One round of three games.Two losses, one win.These two handsome young men had won back their Guaranteed Pass card, got two good student cards, got back their point cards and even won an extra 40 points.\u201cWait a second! After adding those points, isn\u2019t it\u2026\u2026\u2026full?\u201dThere was an outburst of discussions.The dealer picked up the card and swiped it under the mouse\u2019s sad watch.He asked You Huo: \u201c40 points. How to add it for the two gentlemen?\u201dYou Huo: \u201cMake it so that they\u2019re equal.\u201dHe handed his and Qin Jiu\u2019s card over.The dealer was at loss for words: You want me to do maths too???Before the dealer could finish calculating, the edge of the table had already revealed a line:Congratulations Examinee You Huo and Examinee Qin Jiu!It was obvious that the system was the most excited of them all.With Qin Jiu and You Huo\u2019s current points, even if they don\u2019t use the Guaranteed Pass and muddle their way through the last two exams, they could still comfortably pass! At that time, it wouldn\u2019t hesitate to kick those two out.***After leaving the casino, the two of them went to the hotel.Yang Shu had been waiting for them there for a long time.Zhao Jiatong asked: \u201cI heard the invigilators didn\u2019t punish you so why did you only return now? Where did you go?\u201d\u201cGambling.\u201d You Huo answered.Zhao Jiatong: \u201c???\u201dShe and Gao Qi turned and glared at Qin Jiu.They didn\u2019t know what Qin Jiu was like but from their impression A wasn\u2019t someone who gambled. It must be that guys influence!What\u2019s more\u2026\u2026.Wasn\u2019t he aware of his luck? Yet he still dared to gamble?!Qin Jiu looked at Gao Qi\u2019s meaningful look and raised his hands to express his innocence.\u201cPlayed three games and got these.\u201d You Huo placed the cards on the table.He then pulled out the three cards he originally had and similarly placed it on the table.Five good student cards; one complete set with two extra cards.\u201cYou really got a set?!\u201d Gao Qi exclaimed.The moment he saw the cards, he no longer fussed over the gambling matter.\u201cHere\u2014\u2014\u2014Go to the front desk and find the hotel manager. Every rest stop has a special situation registration book. Just write the names of the people you want to team up with.\u201dGao Qi said: \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s not just the name. Code names, nicknames, anything is fine. That\u2019s how the legend went but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true. Anyway, the two of us haven\u2019t used it before.\u201dYou Huo nodded and asked Yang Shu: \u201cWant to go out?\u201dYang Shu instantly became alert: \u201cWhy? You want to give me the Guaranteed Pass? I don\u2019t want it.\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net\u201cAs a doctor, you shouldn\u2019t be wasted here.\u201d Qin Jiu said.Yang Shu immediately said: \u201cI\u2019m not exactly a doctor and I can\u2019t leave yet. I have to find someone.\u201d\u201cFind someone?\u201dYang Shu explained: \u201cI entered with a senior sister but later got separated. I can put up a fight, but she can\u2019t. If I go out alone, what is she going to do?\u201dShe wasn\u2019t used to showing concern. She awkwardly added: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to say to the professor. I was just wondering, if you can form a team and there is no limit to the number of people, can you summon her?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not a problem. What\u2019s your senior sisters name?\u201dYang Shu: \u201cShe\u2019s called Wu Li\u2014\u2014Why? What\u2019s with that expression of yours?\u201dQin Jiu was slightly surprised: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Your senior sister is a neurosurgeon?\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019ve met?!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve met. We just completed a re-examination of history but we were with her in the exam before that.\u201dYang Shu was pleasantly surprised: \u201cReally?\u201dWhen she smiled, she looked livelier and brighter compared to her usual domineering attitude.But she quickly stored her smile away: \u201cThen, how was she? Was she hurt?\u201d\u201cShe was fine when the exam ended. Looking at the time, if I\u2019m not wrong, she should still be in one of the rest stops waiting for her next exam.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good then.\u201d Yang Shu said.You Huo went to the front desk and asked for the registration book. He wrote the Yu father and son, Wu Li, Shu Xue etc. down.The manager was stunned. He couldn\u2019t help but say: \u201cEven with so many in a team, you might not necessarily get a high score.\u201dYou Huo didn\u2019t respond. He clearly didn\u2019t consider this an issue.The manager muttered a few things and then said: \u201cGive me your card to check in. I\u2019ll also need the card of the one who came in together with you.\u201d\u201cHis card is with me.\u201d You Huo said this as he passed the two cards over.The manager turned it over: Three subjects done, total points 54.625.Manager: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Ignore what I said.\u201dWhen You Huo returned to the lounge, everyone had already started chatting.Qin Jiu asked Yang Shu with surprise: \u201cYou\u2019re also in neurology?\u201d\u201cWhat does that expression of yours mean?\u201d Yang Shu snorted.Perhaps it was because she was excited, Miss Yang for once had become a little more talkative. She talked about her major and how she and Wu Li entered the system.She said that a professor had returned from abroad and she and Wu Li went to see him to ask a few questions about a project. Afterwards, they went together to have a quick meal.\u201cThe study was in the attic. When I went down the steps, I missed a step and bumped onto my senior sister.\u201d Yang Shu said, \u201cAnd then we ended up here.\u201dThe situation was similar to You Huo\u2019s.The others also had similar experiences and they soon started to describe theirs.You Huo was in thought for a while. After a while, he asked Yang Shu: \u201cYou just said that the professor was also surnamed Wu?\u201d\u201cYes, he\u2019s senior sister\u2019s uncle.\u201d Yang Shu said, \u201cBut he would always be stricter with senior sister.\u201dYou Huo pulled out his phone and opened up a photo.\u201cIs it this Doctor Wu?\u201dYang Shu was shocked: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.Why do you have professor\u2019s photo? He\u2019s involved with projects and no longer works clinically.\u201dYou Huo: \u201cWhat projects?\u201d\u201cThat I don\u2019t know. My subspecialty is different to his and all projects are independent.\u201d Yang Shu said, \u201cWu Li however has taken part in some so you can\u2019t ask her when she\u2019s here? But she can\u2019t say much and can only tell you some non-confidential things.\u201dAs everyone chatted, the sky outside had darkened.Gao Qi and Zhao Jiatong had to return to the invigilator\u2019s district so You Huo and Qin Jiu went to send them off.The rest stop at night was brightly lit and the nearby casino was still very lively, but the side streets were deserted. Not even a ghost\u2019s shadow could be seen.\u201cYou only take one subject?\u201d\u201cYeah, generally the punishment for rule violation is one subject.\u201d Gao Qi glanced at Qin Jiu, \u201cCases like yours are very rare. Who did you offend?\u201d\u201cWho else.\u201d Qin Jiu smiled.\u201cBut the rules did say that the punishment can reach a maximum of five subjects, so it is not against the rules.\u201dGao Qi internally muttered: The system probably wanted to teach Qin Jiu a lesson, but it probably didn\u2019t expect that\u2026\u2026\u2026These two demon kings would get together.He mumbled: \u201cIt really shot itself in the foot this time. The system must regret this decision to death right now.\u201dQin Jiu let out a low laugh that could be regarded as his response. He turned and looked at You Huo.\u201cRegret what?\u201d Zhao Jiatong heard his mumbling and didn\u2019t understand.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dGao Qi opened his mouth and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just a random comment.\u201dZhao Jiatong was puzzled.She felt that the three men around her each had different things in their minds and the atmosphere was rather strange.But they had reached the white fog.She didn\u2019t think much of it and bid farewell to You Huo and Qin Jiu before turning around and leaving with Gao Qi.\u201cThere\u2019s a supermarket ahead. Go and buy some things for the next exam?\u201d Qin Jiu suggested.You Huo nodded.With more points, the two shopped without a worry. They filled a cart with medicine and food.At the checkout, the boss was completely shocked.Their points gradually decreased, and, in just twenty minutes, their points fell from 54 to 30. It angered the system so much, the checkout system in the supermarket crashed and it took the boss a long time to fix.\u201cIs this everything?\u201d The boss wanted to check with the two to see if they wanted to take any items away.But You Huo just habitually pointed at the cabinet behind him: \u201cA pack of cigarettes.\u201dQin Jiu\u2019s footsteps stopped.You Huo also froze.The smell of smoke from the examination centre seemed to return again\u2026\u2026\u2026.The boss never expected him to add more. He asked, \u201cAre you sure?\u201dYou Huo\u2019s eyes swept past Qin Jiu\u2019s face before looking away.He fell silent for a few seconds and then said to the boss: \u201cYes.\u201dPicking up his items and walking to the door, he heard Qin Jiu behind him say to the boss with a low voice that carried a hint of a smile: \u201cI\u2019ll take a lighter. There\u2019s someone trying to lure my smoking addiction. I\u2019ll wait for him to come borrow fire.\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Now that they\u2019re together they\u2019re just casually scattering dog food\u2026\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yang Shu walked out from the elevator carrying her bag with a confused look.When she saw You Huo and Qin Jiu, she pointed to the attendant next to her and said, \u201cYou came just in time! They said that we have to take the next exam now and asked me to pack up. Is this a joke?\u201d\u201cNow?\u201d Qin Jiu was stunned.The manager nodded, \u201cYes, right now.\u201dYou Huo\u2019s first thought was that they had angered the system again and the other party finally couldn\u2019t hold back its retaliation.But the manager picked up the registration book at the front desk and said: \u201cDidn\u2019t you register a team before?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d You Huo nodded, \u201cForming a team pushes the exam earlier?\u201d\u201cNot for every case.\u201d The manager took a sip of water and dug out a notice from under the table, \u201cThis is also my first time doing this. I would\u2019ve forgotten about the ability to form teams if you hadn\u2019t done so. Here\u2014\u2014We just received this.\u201dYou Huo received it and read its contents.The notice wrote:> Examinee You Huo registered for a team at 5:27pm rest stop time.> In the case of team formation, the resting time for the members will be adjusted such that the least amount takes priority.> Team member Wu Li was originally scheduled to take the next subject at 8:30pm tonight so the exam time for the whole group has been accordingly pushed earlier.>After receiving the notice please send the relevant personnel to the subject selection location before 8:00pm.The manager pointed at the clock on the wall: \u201cIt is now half past seven. The subject selection location is still a distance away from here so you should hurry or I\u2019ll be the one punished.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d Yang Shu was no longer peeved after reading the notice, \u201cThen is it too late to buy something? I don\u2019t have any medicine left. You two\u2014\u2014-\u201dAs she spoke, she noticed the items in their hands: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dShe stared at it for a moment and said, \u201cYou bought back the whole supermarket?\u201dQin Jiu said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten that rich yet, but we have some commonly used medicine.\u201dYou Huo lifted another bag said: \u201cThere\u2019s food too.\u201dYang Shu: \u201cWhy are you buying so much food? You can still eat enough in the exam centre. It was just the last round that was special.\u201dQin Jiu tilted his head towards You Huo: \u201cThis gentleman here was eating normally last time.\u201dYang Shu: \u201cThen why?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201cPicky.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dForget it.The rest stop was very large. It was a small drive away from the hotel to reach the subject selection location.When they arrived at the crossroad, they made it just in time \u2013 exactly 8pm.As usual, the intersection was covered in white fog. Under the night sky, it exuded a cold and damp smell.This place was like the city suburbs. There wasn\u2019t anyone else around.The driver honked his horn and drove away.The car headlight turned around the corner and soon disappeared into the distance.They crossed through the white fog. Before the fog could disperse before their eyes, they heard a calm female voice say, \u201cSomeone\u2019s here.\u201dAnother female voice was a little hoarse, but her tone was gentle: \u201cTo be able to think of forming a team, it must be them.\u201d\u201cAdding you to the team is normal. Adding me is strange.\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesThe fog dispersed and a familiar crossroad once again appeared before them.Two women, one tall and one short stood by the side of the road. It was Wu Li and Shu Xue.\u201cLook! It\u2019s really them!\u201d Shu Xue was very happy and rushed over to greet them, \u201cWe received a notice from the rest stop boss saying that we should come here half an hour in advance because someone had registered us in a team. We knew it must be you two!\u201dAfter another exam, she was still carrying a large belly.You Huo took this in and gently frowned: \u201cYou\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cOh, this?\u201d Shu Xue casually patted her stomach, \u201cAt the rest stop Sister Lili borrowed some hospital equipment and helped take a look. It\u2019s not a problem for the time being. I\u2019ve thought about it and my current bug status makes it more convenient for me to find people and select examination centres so I\u2019m leaving it alone for now.\u201dYou Huo wanted to say something but Shu Xue then whispered: \u201cI finally managed to meet my friends\u2026\u2026..Anyway, I regard you two as friends. I want to stay with you two. I don\u2019t want to go around alone anymore.\u201dNot mentioning anything else, this young lady\u2019s crying skills were very good. Her eyes immediately reddened.You Huo froze for a moment and swallowed his words back down.Shu Xue carefully took in his expression.As soon as the great master nodded, her reddening eyes instantly recovered.You Huo: \u201c?\u201dIt hadn\u2019t been that long, but this young lady had now learnt to cheat others?On the other side Yang Shu and Wu Li were catching up happily.\u201cI was wondering why they would include me in the team.\u201d Wu Li tucked some hair behind her ear, \u201cHow did you run into them?\u201dYang Shu: \u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201dIn essence, she and Wu Li belonged to the group of people who are rational. They sought for stability as well as security.On the first day after being dragged in by the system, they were worried that they would be separated so they had agreed on the subjects that they would do in advance\u2026\u2026Like this they could perhaps one day run into each other again.\u201cMy second round was quite difficult, and it took a long time, so I was a little slower than you.\u201d Yang Shu said, \u201cYou finished History in just a few days, didn\u2019t you? When you finished, I just started on my end and I ran into these two re-examinees.\u201dWu Li nodded: \u201cThat\u2019s quite lucky.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Yang Shu quietly complimented them, \u201cThey are really good. Without those two, I might\u2019ve died in there.\u201dShe paused and added: \u201cActually, that\u2019s not right. Perhaps there would be examinees who would cut down all the infected out of fear to end the exam.\u201dWu Li shook her head: \u201cI don\u2019t know about the others, but I know you won\u2019t. Why else did you study medicine?\u201dYang Shu squinted her eyes and laughed.\u201cBut what happened to your hair? Why is it cut?\u201d Yang Shu asked.\u201cToo troublesome.\u201d\u201cWho cut it? Looks like a dog chewed through it.\u201dWu Li: \u201c\u2026\u2026..Me.\u201dYang Shu let out an \u2018oh\u2019 and changed the topic. She pointed at You Huo and said: \u201cSenior sister, he has something to ask you.\u201dWu Li was surprised. She walked over to You Huo and Qin Jiu: \u201cXiao Yang said you were looking for me?\u201dYang Shu came over and explained: \u201cHe spent some time abroad to treat his sickness. Professor was his attending physician.\u201dWu Li was surprised.\u201cIsn\u2019t it strange?\u201d Yang Shu said.Wu Li nodded. She seemed to have thought of something and her expression turned slightly more serious.She stared at You Huo for a while and then turned her attention to Qin Jiu.After a while she withdrew her gaze and mumbled, \u201cNo wonder\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cNo wonder what?\u201d You Huo asked.\u201cI asked Xiao Xue before whether you two have a problem with your brains\u2026\u2026.\u201d Wi Li awkwardly explained.For a moment the atmosphere was awkward.Yang Shi immediately stepped in to clarify: \u201cShe meant it literally. She\u2019s not cursing you two out.\u201dYou Huo and Qin Jiu didn\u2019t mind because strictly speaking\u2026..They indeed \u2018have a problem with their brains\u2019.Wu Li decided to clarify further: \u201cI\u2019m referring to mental interference.\u201d\u201cYou can tell something like that?\u201d Qin Jiu asked.Wu Li: \u201cEyes, reactions and some others too\u2026\u2026..If you stare at a certain type of people every day for two years, you learn to spot it.\u201d\u201cFor example?\u201dWu Li thought about it and said: \u201cI\u2019ll give you the simplest example. The ones I have researched are those who have had traumatic experiences, so their memories have been cut or altered to varying degrees. It can be considered as a kind of treatment method. They usually share a common characteristic and that is having a habitual action. Some like to touch the tip of their index finger, others like to cross their fingers and so on\u2026\u2026..They\u2019re all seemingly meaningless actions.\u201d\u201cYou should know that people easily become anxious and suspicious when their memories are disturbed. They become alert to everything around them and they don\u2019t like to get too close to anything because they are not certain whether it is real. To a certain extent, some may see that as being lazy or difficult to get close to. These habitual actions are kind of like\u2026\u2026.how should I put it\u2026..A security code? When doing that action, they will feel calm and at ease.\u201d\u201cOr to put it another way, it\u2019s kind of like a safe zone.\u201d\u201cYou would always touch the side of your neck.\u201d Wu Li imitated Qin Jiu\u2019s actions, \u201cAnd the chin down here. Most would only have one, but you have two. The frequency is similar so you would interchange between the two.\u201dShe then said to You Huo: \u201cYou would touch your earring.\u201d\u201cBut that is just an example. Most people with problems would present with these kinds of habits but it doesn\u2019t mean that everyone who has these habits would have a problem.\u201dAs soon as Wu Li started talking about more serious matters, she talked quite quickly but she soon put a halt to it and said: \u201cThere are too many small details in this matter. I have filled 12 notebooks and practically used a new one every two months. There\u2019s too much to talk about.\u201dShe looked at Qin Jiu: \u201cYou were likely interfered with more than once; at least two times.\u201dQin Jiu who heard this was stunned.\u201cTwo times?\u201d He frowned.He only remembered the one time.When did the other time happen?Wu Li then looked at You Huo.Please read this from kk translatesAfter a while, she shook her head with a frown: \u201cFor you, I can\u2019t tell. You seem like you were interfered with once, but you also don\u2019t seem like it.\u201dAs they spoke, the atmosphere had become a little more mysterious.Wu Li said: \u201cAs for the projects I have participated in\u2026\u2026That\u2019s probably what you wanted to ask about, right? It\u2019s inconvenient talking about it here.\u201dShe did an action that surprised Qin Jiu and You Huo.She looked up and scanned her eyes around their surroundings. It was just like actions of the invigilators who have been watched over by the system for many years. \u201cWe will talk about it later when we find a place with better privacy.\u201dThis was something Qin Jiu and You Huo was concerned about and unexpectedly it was the same for Wu Li.As they spoke, two more figures appeared in the white fog.Before their faces were revealed, their voices were heard first.\u201cBrother!\u201d Yu Wen shouted from afar.Hearing this, You Huo felt as if it had been a long time since he was called this.He used to like it when it was quiet, and he would find this cousin who would call him \u201cbrother\u201d left and right very noisy. As for Old Yu who would always smell of alcohol and speak gruffly, he felt that he was very boring.But now, when he once again heard their loud chatter, he found it quite nice.He was very happy.But You Huo\u2019s mood had always been hard to discern by others.You just had to understand him.\u201cWhat happened to your leg?\u201dHe saw Old Yu limping over and asked.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Didn\u2019t pay attention for a moment.\u201d Old Yu answered.Yu Wen immediately spilled everything: \u201cWhat are you talking about? You just got too excited after receiving the team notice and fell down the stairs. Fell flat onto your face just like that.\u201dOld Yu slapped the back of his unfilial son\u2019s head: \u201cShut your mouth!\u201dWhen they were done, the father and son duo looked over at You Huo with silly smiles on their faces.It hadn\u2019t been long but Old Yu had lost a lot of weight. His originally round face had sunken in and he looked a lot wearier.There was a scar on the side of Yu Wen\u2019s face. Stretching down from his cheekbones, it was about the length of a finger. He had also lost weight and his features had become more defined.You Huo\u2019s eyes rested on that scar of his. Yu Wen chuckled: \u201cHow is it? Isn\u2019t it cool? I was scratched by a ghost\u2019s claw in the last round.\u201dSpeaking of exams, You Huo remembered something: \u201cWhy did you two take Politics?\u201d\u201cHuh? How did you know?\u201d Old Yu was surprised.\u201cI went later.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.Punishment.\u201dOld Yu lightly let out an \u2018oh\u2019 and then smiled: \u201cYou\u2019re really\u2026\u2026..\u201dYu Wen on the side clapped in admiration: \u201cMy brother is awesome.\u201d\u201cBut we didn\u2019t choose Politics by choice. Politics wasn\u2019t one of the options for us.\u201d Yu Wen explained, \u201cAt that time we chose History but for some reason we were taken to a Politics exam. Later they said that there was a bug and they opened the wrong entrance causing us to be dragged in.\u201dQin Jiu\u2019s impression of Yu Wen was still of a \u201cfoolish chatterbox\u201d so he asked with interest: \u201cHow did you get out of that exam?\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026Just talking about it makes my palms sweaty.\u201d Yu Wen said, \u201cOld Yu and I were tortured for the first two nights. We were so pitiful and were running around everywhere but those students were even more afraid that us, so I was able to calm down a little. I then thought of an idea\u2014-\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t it nightmares coming true? As my disposition as a study slag, ghosts and monsters are okay but my worst nightmares were always about exams. Like a bunch of papers burying me alive or not being able to write a single word for a major question in the exam.\u201dYu Wen scratched his head and continued: \u201cAnd then I had a good idea. I talked to all the teachers and asked them to pass out exam papers. The exams would run from morning till night and it will be filled with the most difficult questions possible; the more stressful, the better. Those teachers cooperated well and pushed the monthly exams sooner. Twelve hours of exams each day and after three days of that, all the students were having nightmares about those exam papers.\u201d\u201cAnd finally, it was something I have wished for my entire life\u2014\u2013We set fire to the mountain, ah no, set fire to the exam papers. After burning all the exam papers in the school and killing some of the remaining monsters, we got out. Hey brother, aren\u2019t I clever?\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThat was pretty amazing.Very soon, it was 8:28pm.Inside the pavilion, the system sounded again to remind them to select their subject.\u201cThere\u2019s no one else, right?\u201d Yang Shu said, \u201cThen let\u2019s go?\u201dYou Huo however answered: \u201cWait a minute. There\u2019s one more.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201dEveryone looked at each other. All the familiar faces were here and for a moment they didn\u2019t know who was missing.As soon as they were about to voice their doubts, someone belatedly appeared from within the white fog in the distance.It was a good-looking woman with short hair. Her voice carried some sharpness: \u201cI was wondering who pulled me into a team. Turns out it was you. Why? Finally remembered me?\u201dShu Xue let out a small exclamation of surprise: \u201cIsn\u2019t that the boss from the rest stop? The one surnamed Chu?\u201dQin Jiu was surprised: \u201cYou wrote Chu Yue?\u201dYou Huo said: \u201cCouldn\u2019t get to the rest stop so could only get that person to come instead.\u201dThe two walked over one after another and Chu Yue stopped before them.Her gaze fell onto You Huo and then she looked at Qin Jiu. She commented half exasperatedly and half-jokingly: \u201cSo\u2026..You two got together again? This is the third time.\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Third time!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You Huo turned his head away while touching his earring and licking his lips\u2026\u2026Boss Chu is a smart woman.In one glance, she could understand the situation\u2014\u2014You Huo remembered some things and it was only remembered recently. Qin Jiu on the other hand still didn\u2019t remember.She was very familiar with this situation.Afterall, Qin Jiu\u2019s identity was still of an invigilator so in essence he was still controlled and interfered with by the system. Recovering his memory wouldn\u2019t be easy.And adding to that the various rumours circulating around about the antagonistic relationship between 001 and A, their poor relationship and the debate over the one at fault\u2026..Over the past few years, Qin Jiu would most certainly have heard of it and, after entering the system, You Huo would have also heard of it.In a situation like this, it really wasn\u2019t easy for the two of them to stand together again.Even they themselves had forgotten how hard it was\u2026\u2026Chu Yue who had seen it from the beginning to the end knew best.She would always remember that evening several years ago. Qin Jiu who was still an examinee at that time jumped over from the other punishment building and took advantage of the systems loophole back then to ask her for a favour.He said: \u201cIf I accidentally pass the exam or use up all the re-examination opportunities, please help me out. I have to come back.\u201dAt that time, he was in rush and didn\u2019t even come in. He squatted on the windowsill that was multiple floors high observing the situation outside.\u201cMy authority is almost the same as his. Why aren\u2019t you asking him for help instead?\u201d Chu Yue at that time asked him this.Qin Jiu withdrew his gaze from outside the window and laughed: \u201cI know that your scope of authority is slightly different from his. What\u2019s more, you should know how hard it is to convince our Mr. Invigilator A.\u201dPlease support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net\u201cThen why do you think you can convince me?\u201d\u201cThose in the same positions are friends. Aren\u2019t we friends?\u201d Qin Jiu said.Chu Yue thought about it and said, \u201cI guess so.\u201d\u201cBut there are some things I cannot control.\u201d Chu Yue added, \u201cYou should know that if the system sends you out, it will definitely do something such as interfering with your memory. I can find a way to get you back but\u2026..\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Qin Jiu said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay as long as I can come back.\u201dHe looked like he wanted to say something else; was it some kind of promise or guarantee? But in the end, he didn\u2019t any anything and just smiled.This man had an innate talent.It was as if no matter what it was, you could trust in him without any doubtsIn the end, Chu Yue nodded.Qin Jiu checked the time and turned to jump back to the other building. Before leaving, he seemed to have suddenly remembered something and turned to look at Chu Yue with a \u2018shh\u2019 gesture: \u201cKeep it a secret for me. Thanks.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026..She would also always remember that afternoon when Qin Jiu returned as an \u201cinvigilator\u201d.All the initial invigilators and new invigilators were called to a meeting.She and You Huo held the highest authority so they had gone to the main control centre first. When they returned, they ran into Qin Jiu in the corridor outside the meeting room.The weather that day was fine\u2026\u2026.She remembered that it was a little dazzling. The light filtering through the window into the corridor was so bright, it was a little uncomfortable to the eyes.You Huo who was next to her stopped his steps. He stared at the person standing in front of the door to the meeting room.Qin Jiu on the other end glanced over briefly as he entered. After falling in thought for a moment, he suddenly asked, \u201cHave I met you before?\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Chu Yue returned to her senses.The You Huo and Qin Jiu before her were the same as the ones in her memory but they were also not the same.This time, they possessed unpretentious arrogance both inside and out and are more relaxed than they ever have been.It was pretty good.No, it was very good.You Huo heard her sigh gently and thought she had some concerns: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dBoss Chu patted the shoulders of the two of them and joked with a smile on her face: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just suddenly didn\u2019t know what to say. I wish the two of you happiness for the next hundred years.\u201dYou Hu: \u201c?\u201dQin Jiu: \u201c???\u201dThis lady was clearly someone who didn\u2019t do things normally. The two didn\u2019t know how to react.You Huo asked her: \u201cYou were sent to the rest stop as punishment? Why?\u201dChu Yue didn\u2019t answer immediately. She said instead, \u201cSince I was pulled in by you, I guess I\u2019m now an examinee?\u201dYou Huo couldn\u2019t be certain, \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s my first time teaming up. It\u2019s already a surprise that you were able to be pulled in.\u201d\u201cI was also surprised that you had the courage to try. But when you think about it, the rules about team formation mentioned that there is no limit to the number of people and that only one team can be formed from a set of cards. It didn\u2019t specifically mention that it had to be an examinee. The system probably didn\u2019t expect you to take advantage of this loophole.\u201dQin Jiu pointed up at the sky: \u201cWant to curse it out for a try? If you don\u2019t get a warning, you\u2019re considered an examinee.\u201dChu Yue didn\u2019t hesitate to throw out three curses in a row.The small speaker in the pavilion buzzed twice but in the end no warning was given.Chu Yue suddenly laughed out loud.\u201cAh, then I can play without a worry.\u201d Chu Yue said, \u201cOf course, I was punished because I helped someone cause some trouble.\u201d\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t your memory deleted?\u201d\u201cBecause I only helped a little.\u201d Chu Yue\u2019s smile was quite evil, \u201cAccording to the rules, it can be considered a coincidence or mistake. Why should it punish me so harshly? It makes no sense.\u201dBut it also wasn\u2019t a light punishment.She was stripped of her authority and was moved from the position of an invigilator to an empty and desolate rest stop that was in the middle of a snow-covered mountain.Watching over an empty place like that and unable to get in touch with any of her old friends or acquaintances, it was no different to sitting in a jail.The system was like a cruel and curious person who held the power to one\u2019s life and death. Whenever a problem arose, it would pull out those \u201cnaughty dolls\u201d and punish them. If one punishment didn\u2019t work, it would try different one next time.The first time it found out that two powerful individuals had interacted too intimately and would pose a threat to it, it kicked one out and kept the other; cleared one memory and retained the other.It couldn\u2019t understand the emotions unique to them and it couldn\u2019t distinguish between the subtle differences in the emotions. It just knew that there was a saying \u201cIt takes two to tango\u201d.But it was useless.The second time, it realised that the threat was getting bigger and bigger and it almost tripped because of it. And so, it changed its method and cleared both their memories. In addition to that, it also tried out different punishments on the others including evicting them from the core control centre, stripping them of their authority, suppressing them or alienating them.As of now, the effectiveness of those punishments are still unknown.But the system was definitely angered to death.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.netInside the pavilion, the system called out again:\u30108:29pm. The next exam is about to start. Please select the subject as soon as possible.\u3011\u3010Please select the subject as soon as possible.\u3011The three of them returned to the group. Chu Yue said a little regretfully, \u201cThis is a rare opportunity. I have so much to say but\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can say it after entering the exam?\u201d Yang Shu who didn\u2019t know the details suggested this.Chu Yue didn\u2019t mind. She just smiled and said: \u201cThose things can\u2019t be said so casually. Otherwise\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dTheir group may be punished a third time.\u201cBut there is one examination centre that\u2019s an exception.\u201d\u201cHow so?\u201d\u201cIn that examination centre, there is a place where you can talk without a worry.\u201dTalk without a worry?You Huo looked at her. Was she referring to\u2026\u2026A place like the confinement room that is not monitored by the system?If there really is such a place, it would be much more convenient. Afterall, it is quite troublesome relying on violating rules to discuss important matters.\u201cBut forget it. Treat it as if I hadn\u2019t said it.\u201d Chu Yue said, \u201cThere are thousands of exams so the possibility of getting that one randomly is very small. Do we have anyone here with especially good luck? In any case, I\u2019m no good. It\u2019s probably because I have sinned too much. How are you two?\u201dYou Huo wasn\u2019t even able to have the chance to speak.Chu Yue shook her head and continued, \u201cForget it, forget it. It\u2019s probably worse than mine. You two after all are on par to demon kings here in the system. You\u2019re basically the villain.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dYu Wen spoke up, \u201cActually, my luck is quite good but\u2026\u2026.\u201dWith all these unlucky eggs around him, his luck wouldn\u2019t do anything.\u3010Please select the subject as soon as possible.\u3011\u3010Please select the subject as soon as possible. Don\u2019t delay it unnecessarily.\u3011There was clearly still half a minute until the scheduled time, but the system urged them like there was only half a second left.Suddenly, Shu Xue\u2019s voice quietly interrupted, \u201cUm\u2026..You want to go to a specific examination centre? Perhaps\u2026.I can give it a try?\u201dChu Yue looked at her with surprise, \u201cHow can you give it a try young lass? Were you sent here by the system?\u201dShu Xue blushed and quickly waved her hand, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. My circumstance is a little special. Mm\u2026..It\u2019s a long story.\u201dYu Wen helped her summarise, \u201cThis sister here is a bug.\u201d\u201cBug?\u201d Chu Yu was interested. \u201cBugs are good. I like bugs the most. You said that you can choose the examination centre? How so?\u201d\u201cYou can describe it to me; what is the subject, what does it examine and so on. It\u2019s best to say something iconic such as special characters that appear.\u201dChu Yue said: \u201cI haven\u2019t taken it before, so I only know a little.\u201dShe used her finger to gesture a small gap between her fingers.\u201cThe subject should be Mathematics.\u201dThe atmosphere turned a little heavy the moment \u201cMathematics\u201d was mentioned.\u201cAs for something iconic\u2026\u201d Chu Yue furrowed her brows and thought. She suddenly pulled out a photo on her phone, \u201cThis house.\u201dYou Huo and Qin Jiu who stood on the side happened to see the photo.Both of them were stunned.Qin Jiu said: \u201cIsn\u2019t this a house in the invigilator\u2019s district?\u201dChu Yue: \u201cYes.\u201dIn the picture was a small building. It looked exactly the same as the small villas in the invigilator\u2019s district; the ones some invigilators resided in.But to You Huo, this house was a little familiar, especially the camellia next to the window.That camellia was actually no different from other flowers but You Huo felt that it looked very stiff, like it was fake.\u201cDo you remember this place?\u201d Chu Yue asked You Huo.\u201cI lived here before?\u201d\u201cLooks like you still have an impression.\u201d Chu Yue said.\u201cHis place? Wasn\u2019t it already removed?\u201d Qin Jiu said.As far as everyone knew, after Invigilator A was expelled from the system, all related things were removed, hidden or made inaccessible to ordinary people.Of course, this villa was too.Chu Yue said: \u201cNo, according to the original rules, everything must be backed up. It cannot be deleted without leaving any traces behind for no reason so to prevent me from accessing this house, the system hid it somewhere in an examination centre and it became part of it.\u201dYou Huo suddenly remembered something Chu Yue had said to him when they first met. She had said meaningfully: \u201cSome traces are left behind in examination centres. You can try looking for them.\u201dHe had always thought that those so-called traces would be small things like the half-burnt cigarette.Unexpectedly, there was actually something so big.Shu Xue immediately said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give it a try! Let\u2019s choose Mathematics together.\u201d\u3010Please select the subject within the next five seconds!\u3011Everyone wasn\u2019t certain but they still followed Shu Xue to the road marked \u201cMathematics\u201d.The white fog here had never been thicker.You Huo walked through the fog for a very long time. It felt as if there was no one beside him, only himself. Eventually, he reached the end of the fog.The moment the white fog cleared away, the system\u2019s voice sounded again:\u3010This exam is a large-scale joint exam. Examinees, please get ready.\u3011Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Qin Jiu forgot You Huo the second time\u2026. \ud83d\ude2dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Global University Entrance ExaminationChapter 101Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBloody CarnivalChapter 101: Haunted House Siblings\u201cWhat does it mean by large-scale joint exam?\u201d You Huo asked.No one answered.The fog behind him receded and his surroundings cleared up.He was standing on an empty street. To the right was a lonely small house and to the left was an old basketball court.The basketball hoop was old and rusty, the paint on the backboard was chipping off and it would let out low creaks as it swayed in the humid evening wind.Blood-red sunset in the distance shone down, illuminating the street.You Huo looked around, \u201cQin Jiu?\u201dThere was no answer.Qin Jiu wasn\u2019t there, the Yu father and son duo wasn\u2019t there, Chu Yue wasn\u2019t there, and the other three ladies were also not around.You Huo\u2019s expression instantly fell.An old-fashioned speaker was tied to the streetlight at the corner of the street. It quietly let out small static sounds:\u3010A large-scale joint exam, also known as a simultaneous multi-region screening examination.\u3011\u3010This examination includes a total of 2048 examinees from different countries and regions.\u3011Over two thousand?So, where are they? Stuck at the entrance to this exam?You Huo listened expressionlessly to the systems bullshit.\u3010This exam is divided into three stages.\u3011\u3010The first stage is a screening test. It is to be completed by examinees independently.\u3011\u3010Note: Performance in the first stage will determine your position in the second stage.\u3011\u3010The second stage is an open exam. At this stage, you will meet companions from all over the word and can freely compete and eliminate.\u3011Freely competing was understandable.Strictly speaking, their previous exams also allowed examinees to compete with one another, but they had brought that \u201ccompetitive\u201d factor down to an all-time low and conversely forcible turned it into a team battle.But freely eliminating was quite intriguing.The bald man back then only did it to Shu Xue because he feared for his life and pushed Shu Xue out when his life was at risk. In other words, he had the NPC do the dirty work.As for examinees directly killing another examinee, he hadn\u2019t seen it yet.The ability to freely eliminate others \u2013 That likely meant that mutual killing would become a possibility.There was a trace of disgust in You Huo\u2019s eyes.\u3010The third stage is a special stage, also known as bonus question stage. Examinees who successfully pass the second stage will enter the bonus question stage under the premise that all conditions are met. Part of the points from this stage will be included to the total score and the rest will be distributed in the form of rewards.\u3011Please read this from kk translatesHearing this, You Huo understood.He is currently in the first stage and would need to fight alone.The great master was visibly in a poor mood.The system took a deep breath and began to introduce the first stage:\u3010This is a coastal town called Brandon. Shirley and Sali are a pair of siblings. Shirley is a little girl who likes to dress up and one of her favourite activities is to look in the mirror. Whenever there is something that can reflect her appearance, she would always stop to look at it for a while. Sali on the other hand is a little greedy with food but he loves his little sister very much and would always share half of anything delicious with his sister. They are truly a pair of lovely, good children. However recently, this pair of siblings have encountered a difficult problem and have been troubled by it for a long time. Even now, they are unable to reach an answer. Can you help them?\u3011\u3010The exam time for this stage is 3 days. The cumulative score after 3 days will be the final score for the first stage.\u3011\u3010Important reminder: Don\u2019t make Shirley cry, and don\u2019t make Sali hungry.\u3011\u3010Special reminder: Incorrect answers can be changed but a price will need to be paid with every change.\u3011\u3010Good luck.\u3011The system must have taken the wrong medication today. It actually said that incorrect answers could be changed.But hearing the last half of that sentence, it probably meant that it wasn\u2019t anything good.The speaker fell silent.Soon afterwards, boing\u2014- boing\u2014\u2013 sounds could be heard from the basketball court.It sounded like a duet.You Huo turned around and saw a boy and a girl standing on the edge of the basketball court bouncing their balls.The little girl wore a standard horror movie styled red dress and had her hair tied into a small ponytail. The little boy was wearing denim overalls.Other than that, the two of them looked almost exactly the same; golden-yellow hair, snow-white skin and a look of innocence as they looked over in You Huo\u2019s direction.They appeared very young and may possibly have not yet attended elementary school. With their small statures, tall people like You Huo appeared even larger.You Huo walked over.Both the brother and sister could only see him if they did their best to look up, but their hands didn\u2019t stop.They continued to bounce their balls with a lot of strength. The balls hit the ground with a very heavy sound, but they didn\u2019t look like they were exerting much force and was instead smiling sweetly with their mouths closed.Their blue eyes were very clear, and their eyelashes that were the same colour as their hair were long and thick.They were extremely beautiful, like a pair of exquisite dolls.But they also gave off a strange feeling that couldn\u2019t be explained.\u201cShirley? Sali?\u201d You Huo looked at the two of them.The two neither nodded nor shook their heads and just looked curiously at You Huo.After a while, the pair of siblings suddenly grinned and said sweetly: \u201cYou guess?\u201dThe teeth they revealed were thin and dense with some still stained with blood. It was unknown what they had just eaten.You Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dA pair of lovely, good children.System, are you blind???\u201cAre you staying as a guest here?\u201dThis pair of siblings like to talk at the same time. Their actions were surprisingly in sync.\u201cI guess.\u201d You Huo said.He glanced up. The street on this side wasn\u2019t covered in white fog and the other side was facing the sea. The area in which he can move about in was very small; except for the small house, there was nothing else.Beep beep beep.A burst of electronic sounds suddenly sounded.That sound was very familiar. It was the same as the warning sounds invigilators receive.You Huo almost thought Qin Jiu had arrived but after looking around, he realised that the source of the sound was the watches the pair of siblings wore.\u201cIt\u2019s late. We should go back.\u201dSali spoke like an older brother.Shirley let out a sound of agreement and again smiled sweetly, revealing her bloody teeth.They held their balls in their arms and led the way.The ball was bigger than their heads.You Huo watched on for a while and suddenly stretched his hand out: \u201cGive me the ball.\u201dShirley looked up. Her snow-white cheeks moved as she spoke: \u201cYou want to help?\u201dPlease read this from kk translatesYou Huo: \u201cI don\u2019t have that intention. I want to check the weight.\u201dShirley: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dShe puffed up her cheeks and retracted her hands. She held the ball tightly in her arms.Sali raised his head and said: \u201cMum and Dad said that we should carry our own things.\u201dShirley: \u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re so ignorant.\u201dYou Huo: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dAlright then.The pair of siblings rejected the guests unreasonable request.A moment later, Sali realised that his feet were no longer touching the ground.A pair of thin, slender hands passed through under his arm and lifted him up.That guest said: \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to carry the ball together with the person.\u201dHis tone was cold and indifferent, like a bully.\u2026\u2026..A bully that looked especially good.Under the dark stares from the pair of siblings, You Huo placed the two back down.He originally thought the two balls just looked heavy, but he didn\u2019t expect it to really be quite heavy.It was as if there was something stuffed inside it.What could be put into something of this size?You Huo\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t very good.Sali pulled out a key that was hanging from his neck and opened the door.You Huo had thought that he would smell something strange\u2014\u2014\u2014For example, something rotting? Or something sour? Or perhaps something bloody?In accordance to how normal horror movies worked, the house would probably have a smell that made people uncomfortable.But unexpectedly, there was just a faint fragrance in the house.It was so faint; it was easy to overlook.It was as if someone had left some kind of woody incense stick somewhere but had forgotten about it and, after all these years, only a small residual smell was left.Some say that smells and memories are very closely linked. It helps make the moment become more vivid and memorable.The moment he smelt this; countless memories started to get restless.You Huo could almost feel surges in his brain and heart.He stepped in and stopped at the door.A large French window on one side, a living room straight ahead and \u2018U\u2019 shaped stairs that led upstairs. When the sun rays filtered through the window from outside, a square shaped block of light was casted onto the stairs.And there was also\u2026\u2026..a wooden passage that went downstairs. Once downstairs, there would be a separate room.These have all appeared in his dreams.This was actually his house, but he wasn\u2019t able to recognise it from the outside.It was because the system had stupidly modified its exterior into a haunted house.But the details and decoration inside was different. There were pictures of the pair of siblings hanging on the walls as well as dolls and marbles scattered across the floor. There were traces of children living here in every corner of the house.\u201cWhy are you just standing at the door?\u201d The siblings urged him, \u201cHurry up. We still haven\u2019t done our homework.\u201dWhile he was momentarily in daze, the balls in their arms had disappeared.\u201cWhat homework?\u201d You Huo asked.The question this time said that the pair of siblings had encountered a difficult problem and the subject this time was also Mathematics.He was thinking\u2026\u2026.Could the problem be something to do with their homework?But the combined age of these two here would only be eight years old?What could their homework be? Elementary maths?\u201cMm\u2014\u2014\u2013Before Mum and Dad go out to play, they would always like to leave us with a small question to test my brother and I.\u201dShirley was looking at a dressing mirror.She lifted the corner of her dress and tilted her head as she looked at her reflection.When the little girl stared at the mirror, her eyes didn\u2019t move. It was a little bone-chilling.Older brother Sali picked up the dolls and marbles and placed them on the sofa. He beckoned to You Huo and said, \u201cI\u2019ll show you our homework later. I\u2019m the owner right now. If you want to have a room, you have to listen to me.\u201dYou Huo managed to squeeze out some patience. He followed after Sali.\u201cMum said that guests should stay in the guest room. You can sleep in this room tonight.\u201d Sali dragged You Huo into the only bedroom on the first floor. He opened the window and said, \u201cLook. This window faces the backyard. You can sometimes see squirrels outside. I like this room the most.\u201dYou Huo had no interest in the backyard or the squirrels.With his arms crossed and his back towards the window, he watched Sali rush over to open a cabinet to pull out a duvet.You Huo suddenly said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay in this room.\u201dSali was stunned: \u201cWhy?\u201dHe turned around and asked again: \u201cWhere would you stay then?\u201dYou Huo leaned against the window and tapped his feet: \u201cThe one underground.\u201d\u201cHow did you know there\u2019s another room underground?\u201d After Sali asked this, he immediately shook his head: \u201cMum said no. Guests must stay here.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s you mum?\u201dSali was blank for a few seconds. He then replied: \u201cAnyway, Mum said no!\u201d\u201cMy feet belong to me.\u201dSali suddenly let out a sharp scream. It was something wild children would do for no reason.The tap tap tap of leather shoes grew louder.Shirley stuck her head in from outside: \u201cSali, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cThis guest isn\u2019t being obedient.\u201d Sali glared at You Huo.\u201cDisobedient people are all bad children.\u201d Shirley walked in and stood next to her brother.Sali: \u201cBad children will be punished.\u201dShirley: \u201cA very terrible punishment.\u201dSali: \u201cYou will regret it.\u201dAs the two brats spoke, their expressions darkened and the atmosphere around them turned strange.Many guests were afraid of them. They would be especially afraid at a time like thin and would always become pale and instantly turn obedient.But the one this time remained indifferent.You Huo snorted and was about to speak.Suddenly, there were some sounds from behind him. The footsteps and whispers sounded like it was more than one person.Soon afterwards, a lazy voice that carried slight amusement sounded from behind You Huo: \u201cThe first thing I hear after entering is a threat. Which brat has the guts to be so rude?\u201dYou Huo froze for a moment and turned to look back.He saw Qin Jiu standing outside the window with one hand on the window frame and the other supporting the opened window above him. He fearlessly taunted the children.And behind him, the others were in the process of climbing over the fence. Yu Wen was getting ready to catch Old Yu who was straddling the fence while Shu Xue breathed a sigh of relief and said: \u201cFinally found everyone.\u201dSali and Shirley stared at Qin Jiu: \u201cWho are you?!\u201dQin Jiu said, \u201cLet me think. What do you call him?\u201dHe raised his chin and pointed it at You Huo.Sali answered straightforwardly: \u201cGuest!\u201dQin Jiu let out an \u2018oh\u2019: \u201cThen I am the guest\u2019s boyfriend.\u201dOld Yu fell off from the fence with a thud.Please support the translator and read this from clicknovel.net \\nClickNovel has something to say: Qin Jiu has so many great one-liners \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
