    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1.1In the dark mud room, a man sat on a bed staring at the worn-out roof beams, not knowing what to think. By the edge of the kang, eight large mahogany boxes were stacked in two rows of four, making the room, which was already not very big, even more crowded. There was a big red \u2018Xi\u2019 on the wall by the bed and big red bedding under the man\u2019s buttocks, but it was still not enough to hide the shabbiness of the room.*Kang: The kang is a living and sleeping platform, a heated bed; (especially in northern Chinese houses) it is a masonry or earthen platform at one end of a room, heated in winter by fires underneath and spread with mats for sleeping.From time to time there was movement outside, but the man paid no attention to it. Tired of tilting his neck, he simply laid down with an uncertain look, as if he was in daze. Time passed while he was in a daze. He was hungry, but he didn\u2019t bother to get off the bed to look for food. No one came in to look for him for a long time. Just when he was ready to dwell until the end of time, he heard a loud shout from outside.\u201cBrother, the Shao family is making trouble again. Go over there! Mother is going to be pissed off!\u201d A fat woman shouted outside the courtyard. Hearing the shrill voice, the man frowned.In the dirty yard, Wang Shijing, wearing a black blindfold, put down his bamboo strips and stood up. The woman, Wang Guo, the second younger sister of Wang Shijing, shouted again. \u201cMother, I told you to call your family as well. They are all from his mother\u2019s family. He has to go over there.\u201d At this point, the woman\u2019s eyes were filled with disgust. Since she came, she never looked at Wang Shijing, who she called \u2018Big Brother.\u2019 Wang Shijing ignored her and said to the two children hiding beside him, \u201cStay at home.\u201d Then he walked out.\u201cHey! Brother, call him! There are so many people in their house. What\u2019s the use of going there alone?\u201d As he said that, Wang Guo called out to his younger brother. \u201cYou inside, come out! Look what you\u2019ve done to our family! Come out!\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Wang Shijing gave a low roar. Wang Guo who got scared immediately said resentfully, \u201cWhat, do you mean that I was wrong Big Brother? If it weren\u2019t for him, our family wouldn\u2019t be so restless! My brother Zheng was so disturbed by him, that he didn\u2019t even go to class!\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s remaining eye stared coldly at the woman, making her swallow her remaining words. Wang Shijing was tall and strong, with a black eye patch on his left eye. But the eye patch could not cover the deep scar that ran from his forehead to his chin. The eye patch and scar also made Wang Shijing look very ugly and gloomy, so no one dared to look at him. Even his own parents and brothers, let alone his first wife and his own children, who were frightened by him.Hearing a loud \u2018bang,\u2019 the two children shrieked together at the doorway of the cookhouse in fear. Wang Shijing turned around while Wang Guo whispered to his younger brother, \u201cI thought he was dead.\u201dThe man who appeared was Shao Yunan, who had obviously kicked the door open, still looking unwell. \u201cYour family is here.\u201dGlancing at Wang Shijing and the ugly fat woman, Shao Yunan said expressionlessly, \u201cI\u2019m hungry, is there anything to eat?\u201dWang Shijing went into the kitchen, while Shao Yunan who followed him said nonchalantly, \u201cI\u2019ll get it myself.\u201d His hands were dirty. Wang Shijing also did not intend to please him, so he just pointed at the bowl on top of the stove and said, \u201cThere are two nests inside.\u201dNest\u2026The frown between Shao Yunan\u2019s eyebrows could kill a mosquito, but he still went up and uncovered the bowl. If he hadn\u2019t been so hungry, he definitely would have dropped the bowl and left. The nest was made from corn flour, but was definitely not the usual golden yellow, sweet corn nest. The black and yellow color at first glance made people think that it absolutely couldn\u2019t be food, but some kind of excrement.\u201cNothing else?\u201d Shao Yunan asked hopelessly.\u201cNothing more.\u201d The tone without any ups or downs mercilessly shattered Shao Yunan\u2019s hopes. Shao Yunan wanted to grab the other party\u2019s collar and curse,\u00a0 \u2018You\u2019re a big fu*king man and you can only give me that stuff to eat?\u2019Taking one deep breath after another, Shao Yunan grabbed a nest and gritted his teeth. \u201cPour me a glass of water.\u201d Wang Shijing turned around. \u201cWash your hands first!\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s footsteps paused as he opened the lid of the water jar and scooped up some water before handing it to Shao Yunan. Shao Yunan looked at the other party\u2019s dirty and muddy hands before grabbing the water scoop, spilling the water on the ground, and then scooping a new ladle of water, before eating two nests reluctantly.A boy and a girl huddled in the corner outside the door and kept stealing glances at Shao Yunan. The older boy hugged his sister tightly, lips pursed. The girl\u2019s face was full of fear as she kept biting her lips and trying not to cry. Shao Yunan, who was in a bad mood, did not pay special attention to the two children. He was feeling terrible.\u201cBrother, hurry up!\u201dShao Yunan threw the ladle into the jar. Since Wang Shijinghad not said anything yet, he yelled, \u201cCall your mother! I feel like throwing up when I hear your voice! Believe it or not!\u201d His roar not only made the flesh of the fat woman tremble, but also frightened the villagers around him. Not to mention the two children who had already been afraid all this time.Wang Shijing frowned. Wang Guo was also startled, before opening his mouth and howling. \u201cOops! As soon as he entered our house, he started bullying people! Eldest brother! Look at the good man you married! You guys!\u201dThe annoying voice that pierced through the brain stopped abruptly and the villagers who were watching backed away in shock. Shao Yunan walked step by step towards the woman, who was shivering all over. When she saw clearly what was flying past her ear, she screamed even louder and ran away. That speed was very surprising for how big she was.Shao Yunan did not stop because of the woman\u2019s departure. As he walked out of the yard, the onlookers scattered in a hurry, while Shao Yunan picked up the firewood axe from the ground. He then turned his head and looked at Wang Shijing, whose muscles were tense and said irritably, \u201cLet\u2019s go over and take a look.\u201d Wang Shijing turned back to the two terrified children. \u201cYou two go inside.\u201dThe weak-legged boy went inside the room with his crying sister in his arms. Seeing them close the door, Wang Shijing went outside. When Wang Shijing locked the courtyard door, Shao Yunan directly said, \u201cLead the way.\u201dWang Shijing walked silently to Lizheng\u2019s house, while Shao Yunan took a step away from him and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been confused these days. I\u2019ve just figured out what\u2019s going on. I will take care of my side later, so take care of your side now. If you can\u2019t handle it, we\u2019ll break up and you can do whatever you want.\u00a0What the fu*k is all this shit!\u201cShao Yunan said the last sentence to himself. Wang Shijing stopped in his tracks and turned around. Shao Yunan tilted his head and saw flames in his eyes. Since he came back with this face, few people dared to look him in the eye. Even friends who used to be close to him, were now afraid of him. Shao Yunan\u2019s direct gaze at Wang Shijing at least made it a little easier. It was not only Shao Yunan who was upset about this marriage, it was just that Wang Shijing had not shown it.Wang Shijing could not fully understand Shao Yunan\u2019s words, but he still could figure out what he meant. He lived in a place that was remote and after what Shao Yunan said, no one dared to come forward. The man simply spread his arms and said, \u201cI know that you were also forced. If you want to leave, I\u2019ll make peace with you. I also don\u2019t want the things you brought.\u201d There was a moment of silence. \u201cBut if you are willing to stay, as long as you do not embarrass my two children, I will try my best to support my family and support you. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019ll be rich or famous, but I won\u2019t starve you or freeze you. I just split up from my family and didn\u2019t have time to buy anything. When I\u2019m done with these things, I\u2019ll take care of everything that needs to be done.\u201dWhen he said these words, Wang Shijing\u2019s face was expressionless. There was not even a flicker of emotion in his one eye. But these few words let Shao Yunan, who was uneasy, relax a lot. In this world, people who were disowned were much more miserable than those who were divorced. With this sentence alone, Shao Yunan felt some affection for Wang Shijing. Shao Yunan rubbed his face hard and exhaled before looking at the tall and strong man who was more than half a head taller than him and said, \u201cYou and I will talk more about it when we get back. I kind of married you, so I can ignore my side of the family, but what about you? I think filial piety is the most important thing here. If I stay, I won\u2019t be able to give them face.\u201d The man turned around and lifted his foot. \u201cI\u2019ve already separated. I\u2019ll take care of what\u2019s mine to take care of and what\u2019s not, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\u2018I hope you can do it.\u2019\u00a0Shao Yunan did not intend for Wang Shijing to make a promise now. They were simply not familiar with each other yet, but they will talk after the immediate matter is settled.Shao Yunan already knew where Lizheng\u2019s house was, without the man leading the way. Looking at the courtyard surrounded by three houses, coupled with the distant noise, as long as you were not blind or deaf, you would have known that something had happened. Shao Yunan still had the firewood axe in his hand, but Wang Shijing didn\u2019t want it back.Some of the onlookers saw the two men and immediately shouted, \u201cShijing is here. Shijing came!\u201dEdited by: JaislandProofreader:Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

Soon a path was opened by the crowd. The first of two young men, the same age as Wang Shijing, looked at Shao Yunan with the firewood axe, while the other pulled Wang Shijing aside and whispered anxiously. \u201cBrother Shijing, you have to be tough when it comes to asking to withdraw from the marriage and not paying for it. You\u2019ve already married this man and they don\u2019t seem to care how much trouble they make. The aunts and uncles have been completely wronged in their hearts and the old aunt wants you to divorce your wife. I\u2019m afraid the patriarch won\u2019t make the decision for you. You have to make it yourself. Don\u2019t let them hold you again.\u201dWang Shijing looked at Shao Yunan with an impatient expression and said faintly, \u201cI know what\u2019s in my heart.\u201d The man also looked at Shao Yunan and hesitated. \u201cSo, what do you want?\u201d Wang Shijing said, \u201cIf he wants to stay, I want it.\u201dWang Shijing wanted to say something else, but someone inside was already shouting. \u201cWang Shijing! Your mother is going to be pissed off. Are you a turtle? Why don\u2019t you hurry up and come in!\u201dSome of the villagers were watching the fun, while others were shaking their heads and sighing for Wang Shijing. While others were unconcerned, some of them were mocking them. Shao Yunan did not wait for Wang Shijing and went over first. The firewood axe in his hand made the crowd around him wary and backed off. Wang Shijing patted the young man and followed him in stride.As soon as Shao Yunan entered the yard, before he could see the man clearly, someone pointed at his nose and scolded. \u201cYou are a lost star! You harmed our old Wang\u2019s house before entering the door and we won\u2019t live in peace after you married into our family. We can\u2019t afford a daughter-in-law like you, so get out of here!\u201dImmediately, another shrew\u2019s voice interjected. \u201cOld Wang, you old bastard. You still have no shame. Who begged my Yunan to come to the door in the first place! Now that your son has gotten a scholarship, you don\u2019t want my Yunan. Yunan, my son, your life is so hard. Blame this mother for being blind and believing that they are a generous family!\u201dThe old woman sat down on the ground and started another round of crying. \u201dAt first, she begged to marry you, but when her son got admitted to the examination, she broke up the marriage. When she said that you would marry the head of the family, mother agreed to let you marry the widower. But he turns out to be a poor man who has split up from the family. Let\u2019s see how the Wangs bully and deceive people! Look at how the Wang family abandoned the wife and cheated people out of their marriage!\u201d\u201cOur Wang family is also wronged!\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s mother, Mrs. Wang was not willing to be left behind, so she also sat down on the ground and started to howl. \u201cMy son withdrew from the marriage because the Shao family cheated the eight characters. This family separation was proposed by the oldest, so as the mother, how could I not agree?!\u201d\u201cYuck! Is that why your Wang family poured dirty water on my family for the sake of withdrawing the marriage! My son\u2019s fortune has never changed! Your splitting up the family is simply to make my son suffer with your eldest! Old man Wang, if you don\u2019t compensate my Shao family for the loss today, I Shao Jiacun will never stop!\u201dShao Yunan\u2019s eldest brother and the villagers of Shaojia Village who accompanied him, immediately rolled up their sleeves and prepared for war. But in fact, even the wronged Mrs. Wang, who was actually the one who was in the wrong, relied on the fact she was on her own territory and accused the Shaos of stealing and changing the eight characters.\u201cOne hundred taels! Or we\u2019ll let everyone outside know that the Wang family\u2019s son, Wang Shenglang dislikes the poor and loves the rich and abandoned the marriage!\u201d This was said by Shao Yunan\u2019s brother, Shao Dahu.\u201cOne hundred taels! Even if your death star was sold to a big family as a male concubine, he would not be worth that much money!\u201d As soon as she heard the demand for money, Old Mrs. Wang jumped up from the ground. Old Mrs. Wang was a relatively wealthy farmer that could earn 20 or 30 taels of income a year without spending money on food or drink, so you couldn\u2019t blame her for jumping up.Wang Tianyan, the second eldest son of the Wang family, shouted at the other side. \u201cBig Brother! What are you waiting for?! Your father-in-law\u2019s family is going to kill our parents!\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s father, Wang Dali, squatted in the corner, oblivious to the chaos, while both groups argued. Wang Zhisong, the third child of the Wang family, left home three days ago on the grounds of meeting friends and didn\u2019t even show up for his eldest brother\u2019s marriage.The Wang clan was a large family in Xiushui Village, but Xiushui Village was frankly speaking, a medium village with mixed surnames. The big clan surnames were Wang, Zhao, and Sun, as well as some other scattered households with different surnames. But the Shao family\u2019s surname was from a large village, which had a history that was a hundred years longer than Xiushui Village. Old lady Shao\u2019s family in the village could also be considered an upper middle class family. If it were not for Wang Zhisong\u2019s success in studying, Wang\u2019s family in Xiushui Village would not be considered a big family. In addition, Mrs. Wang had given the Shao family a lot of money for this marriage.Speaking of the whole thing, the Wang family was in the wrong, so Shao\u2019s patriarch had personally come from the Shao family village. If not for the clan\u2019s face and the fact that the people of the village could not be allowed to suffer losses outside the village, Xiushui Village really did not want to care about the Wang family. Wang Wenhe, the patriarch of the Wang family, also could not allow his people to be bullied. So even though he knew it was a wrong done by Mrs. Wang\u2019s family, he could not let Shao\u2019s village make trouble here. Although Lizheng and Zhao Zheng were the heads of the Zhao family, at this time, the village naturally had to show a united front. Just when Zhao Zheng didn\u2019t know how to solve the matter, a loud noise suddenly stopped the courtyard full of cursing.Picking up a corner of the table from the ground, Shao Yunan apologetically said towards the startled Lizheng, \u201cSorry, Uncle Lizheng. I wanted to see if the blade was sharp or not. I didn\u2019t expect it to be so sharp. I\u2019ll pay for the table tomorrow.\u201dLizheng first looked at the firewood axe in Shao Yunan\u2019s hands and then looked at the corner of the table, before swallowing his saliva. \u201cNo, this table was already old.\u201d\u201cYunan.\u201d Old Mrs. Shao got up from the ground and wiped her face, that was without a single tear, to lean towards her son, but Shao Yunan raised his hand to stop her. \u201cDon\u2019t move. We\u2019ll talk about what\u2019s going on later, but first let\u2019s get things straight.\u201d\u201cYunan! How can you talk back to your mother!?\u201d Shao Dahu\u2019s face immediately sank and old lady Shao\u2019s expression also darkened.Edited by: JaislandProofreader:Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At first, in order to save the third son of the Wang family, the Wang family cried and begged you to marry me to him. But if you really wanted what was the best for me, you wouldn\u2019t have agreed. As if I was a woman they cried and begged and you promised them. I respect your kindness. But I am a man. You beat and scolded me into agreeing, but only for their fifty taels of silver.\u201dThe surrounding chatter exploded with a \u2018boom\u2019. It turned out that only fifty taels of silver was agreed on at the beginning! This was almost two to three years of income for an ordinary farmer! Old lady Wang\u2019s family was really rich!\u201cShao Yunan!\u201d Shao Dahu wanted to strangle his brother. \u201cWho gave you the guts to talk nonsense here!\u201d He was surprised. How could this brother who never dared to hit or scold back, dare to act so tough today?Shao Yunan picked up his firewood axe again and another corner of the table fell to the ground. The ruthlessness of his face made Shao Dahu, who wanted to go forward and beat him, take a step back and shut up. The Wang family members who wanted to make noise also followed his example. The cowardly ones were afraid to act bold and the bold ones were afraid to act reckless. To deal with this kind of people, even the highly educated Shao Yunan could only use this method to solve them. Shao Yunan has not been afraid of making trouble since he was a child and when he came here, he wanted to vent his frustration in the face of these unreasonable people.\u201cYou sold me for 50 taels and now you\u2019re ready to sell me again for 100 taels? You\u2019re obviously a bitch, but you want to set up an altar for yourself. Don\u2019t fu*king say it was for me.\u201d\u201cShao Yunan! You are itching again, you bastard!\u201dOld lady Shao screamed.With an axe in his hands, Shao Yunan said, \u201cI\u2019ve already given my life back to you! I, Shao Yunan, have nothing to do with the Shao family, since the day I left the Shao family. Old lady Shao, you know how I got to Wang\u2019s house and how I got married? You know in your heart that if you want to live, keep your man, and let your daughter live, you won\u2019t mess with me again. Or we\u2019ll break the net! My life for your Shao family\u2019s four lives. It\u2019s worth it!\u201dShao Yunan\u2019s ruthlessness and his address to his \u2018own mother\u2019 upset Shao Dahu, old lady Shao, and the villagers of Shaojia Village who came with him. Shao Yunan was not like this before! An old man from Shaojia Village could not help saying, \u201cYunan, how can you talk to your mother and eldest brother like this? Your mother didn\u2019t raise you to be so unfilial!\u201d\u201cShe is not kind, so why should I be filial. My business is none of your business!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d The old man\u2019s face turned white with anger.Shao Yunan turned to the pale old lady Shao and Shao Dahu. \u201cYou came back last time to cause trouble, because the Wang family withdrew from the marriage for the third son. This time you come back to make trouble, because Wang Shijing separated from his family. I had no choice in that and he won\u2019t profit from your family in the future. Now you are not afraid to ask for 100 taels from the Wang family and use me to get more money. I\u2019m not afraid of losing face, so if you make trouble again, I\u2019ll go to the court tomorrow and beat the drum!\u201dOld lady Shao shivered for a moment, then with an \u2018ow\u2019 sat down on the ground to cry again. Shao Yunan immediately said to Lizheng, \u201cUncle Lizheng, please go with me to the county court, I want to sue them.\u201d\u201cShao Yunan!\u201d Old lady Shao and Shao Dahu shouted at the same time. Old lady Shao no longer dared to sit on the ground. The fear on their faces attracted everyone\u2019s attention. What exactly will the Shao family do?\u201cWill you get out of here or not?\u201d Shao Yunan was fierce.\u201cYou, you\u2026\u201d Shao Dahu sternly pointed at Shao Yunan. Shao Yunan immediately said, \u201cUncle Lizheng, please lend me a pen and paper. I want to write a letter.\u201d\u201cShijing\u2026\u201d Lizheng, who didn\u2019t know the inside story, didn\u2019t want to see Shao Yunan and the Shao family bring things to that stage. Originally it was the Wang family who was unreasonable. Wang Shijing, who had never opened his mouth till now, said, \u201cUncle Zheng, please listen to him.\u201dWang Shijing spoke, so uncle Li looked at the two people, sighed and asked his son to take out the pen, ink, and inkstone. Shao Yunan said to the mother and son, \u201cToday we will write a decision. From now on, the Shao family will have nothing to do with me. Whether I live or die, it will have nothing to do with the Shao family.\u201d\u201cShao Yunan, don\u2019t think you\u2019re tough just because you\u2019re married. You\u2019ll be crying in the future!\u201d Shao Dahu really wanted to kill Shao Yunan, but this time he was already on the losing end. Shao Yunan sneered. \u201cEven if I cry to death, it has nothing to do with you. I don\u2019t fear a ghost calling at the door in the middle of the night. Shao Dahu, if you want your Shao family to live in peace, don\u2019t come and mess with me. If you want an official son-in-law so badly, marry Shao Zhen to the third son of the Wang family.\u201d\u201cOh, Shao Yunan, you son of a bitch!\u201d These kinds of words could not be said indiscriminately in this era. Old lady Shao was still counting on her daughter to marry into a big family, so at first she still rushed to get a hold of Shao Yunan, who dodged it and laughed coldly. \u201cIt\u2019s true that if it is not your own child, you can just sell it and send it to someone else\u2019s house happily. But if it\u2019s your own child, you want to protect it.\u201dWhen these words came out, the crowd was shocked. Even the people from the Shao family were shocked. Shao Dahu\u2019s face was so frightened that old lady Shao immediately forgot to deny it. Wang Shijing wrinkled his brows and stared at Shao Yunan.\u201cYunan, what is biological or not? Tell me clearly what you mean!\u201d The old Shao family asked harshly.Shao Yunan only said, \u201cIf you want to know what\u2019s going on, take them back and ask.\u201d\u201cShao Yunan! Don\u2019t talk nonsense!\u201d Shao Dahu did not dare to look into the eyes of the village people at all. Shao Yunan showed a smile that frightened Shao Dahu, then he pointed to his head and said. \u201cI remember it clearly. How about calling old man Shao over. Let\u2019s do a blood recognition?\u201dAs soon as these words came out, old lady Shao yelled at Shao Dahu. \u201cDahu, let\u2019s go back. He does not recognize us, so we will also not recognize him! Just pretend\u2026 just pretend that I never had this sinful son!\u201d\u201cUgh! You don\u2019t even have the ability to give birth to me.\u201d Shao Yunan\u2019s counterattack made old lady Shao and Shao Dahu\u2019s face turn pale, but neither of them dared to make trouble any more.\u00a0 At this point, the relationship between Shao Yunan and the Shao family was already clear at a glance. The Shao village people who come here also looked at old lady Shao and her son in a wrong way. The patriarch also had no intention to support Shao\u2019s mother and son here any more, so he just clenched his teeth and said, \u201cWhat a disgrace! Take them back to the village!\u201d\u201cWait! A letter of decision!\u201dWith so many pairs of eyes staring, plus the fact that there were wrongdoings in their hearts and patriarch Shao was watching, the two sides signed a decision to sever the relationship in three copies. One for Shao Yunan, one for old lady Shao, and one for the patriarch.Taking the letter of determination, complex gazes looked at the satisfied Shao Yunan. Then the old men apologized to Zhao Lizheng and took the Shao village people away, along with the Shao family mother and son. When the Shao family left, the Wang family members immediately held out their chest and looked up. Old lady Wang pointed at Shao Yunan with a cry and scolded, \u201cEldest! If you don\u2019t take this evil star away, your father and I won\u2019t have a son like you!\u201dSince it was a member of the Wang family, Shao Yunan sat quietly at the wooden table where he had cut off two of the corners. Wang Shijing said unmoved, \u201cIt was you and my father who forced me to marry. Now that I\u2019m married, he\u2019s my person and I won\u2019t leave him.\u201dThere was an uproar around, \u2018forcing\u2019 Wang Shijing to marry? New gossip ignited another wave of enthusiasm among the villagers. \u201cYou\u2019re still not stopping?\u201d Old lady Wang\u2019s scream made Shao Yunan want to prick his ears, as if he didn\u2019t hear the meaning of Wang Shijing\u2019s words.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wang Dali, come here!\u201dWang Dali, Wang Shijing\u2019s father, who had been cowering in the corner, shrank, but because of the eyes of uncle Lizheng and the villagers, he stood up and walked over. Zhao Lizheng said with a grunt, \u201cWhen you and your wife forced Shijing to marry this person, Shijing made it clear that he wanted to split up. If you wanted him to marry, he would be able to separate from the family. That\u2019s what you promised. Now if you want Shijing to divorce his wife again, you are not only rude, but also shameless!\u201dThis matter was known to uncle Lizheng, but he didn\u2019t spread it out. Now that Wang Shijing said it himself, there was no need to save Wang\u2019s face. This remark was so heavy that there was a burst of laughter around him. Wang Wenhe, the patriarch of the Wang clan, felt his face was burning.\u201cWenhe\u2026 \u201c Old lady Wang asked the patriarch for help, but Lizheng also looked at Wang Wenhe and said, \u201cMaster Wang, if they hadn\u2019t given up the marriage for no reason, they wouldn\u2019t have caused these things.\u201d Old lady Wang interrupted Li Zheng\u2019s words and said hurriedly, \u201cWhat do you mean for no reason? The eight characters\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Wang Wenhe was also very impatient. If the Wang family had not produced a Wang Zhisong who was great at studying and had a bearing on the glory of the entire Wang family, he would not have come forward for the Wang family. Wang Wenhe pointed to old lady Wang and said, \u201cYou are a blind man! Shijing has separated. As long as he is happy, he can marry anyone. This matter was clearly stated before the separation, so why are you making a fuss? And you!\u201d Wang Wenhe also pointed to Wang Dahu. \u201cHow did you become the head of the family? Look at all these troubles in your family! Are you not afraid of affecting Zhisong?\u201dAs soon as Wang Zhisong was mentioned, old lady Wang didn\u2019t dare to complain anymore. While Wang Dali, as usual, only bowed his head and hummed, not daring to say a word. Wang Wenhe sighed and turned to Wang Shijing. \u201cShijing, have you thought it over and you want this marriage?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Wang Shijing went to Shao Yunan and bent over to take the firewood axe from his hand. \u201cFrom now on, he is my wife and the mother of my children.\u201d\u2018Mother, my ass!\u2019\u00a0Not wanting to make any more trouble, Shao Yunan stayed quiet.\u201cBig brother married the son of the Shao family, who is not from the Shao family, right? So he shouldn\u2019t be counted when it comes to dividing the family.\u201d A sharp voice once again confused the crowd, which had already been subdued by Wang Wenhe. Wang Wenhe rebuked angrily, \u201cWhat do you have to do with this? You son of a bitch, take care of your family!\u201dIt was Wang Tianyan\u2019s wife, Wang Guo who shouted it. Wang Tianyan curled his mouth and muttered, \u201cMy wife is right. The eldest brother split up and gave out so many things, but the one who married into the family, we don\u2019t know whose family he belongs to.\u201dWang Wenhe really wanted to hit someone, but the old lady listened. She immediately straightened her back, and said to the eldest son, \u201cShijing, mother wanted you to marry the son of the Shao family, not some kind of unknown goods from nowhere! This marriage was not unreasonable at the beginning. Either you leave him and go home, or you keep him and give back the land and house that have been allocated to you. We can\u2019t afford such a wife in the Wang family!\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s jaw tightened for a moment, but his voice sounded like usual. \u201cI don\u2019t care where he is from. I only care that his name is Shao Yunan and he is my legitimate wife.\u201d Old lady Wang jumped three feet high and said, \u201cIf you want to stay with him you no longer recognize me as a mother!\u201dWang Tianyan acted like he suddenly had a shit stirring stick by his side. \u201cThe one who married the Shao family\u2019s \u2018real\u2019 son was the one who was given so many fields, eldest brother.\u201d Wang Guo echoed, \u201cDidn\u2019t the Shao family say they would pay 20 taels of silver as long as our family married them? None of this money was given and we still gave out so much land. I refuse to hand over his dowry.\u201dNowadays, twenty taels of silver, excluding Wang Zhisong\u2019s expenses, was enough for the rest of the Wang family to spend for half a year. Wang Shijing looked at his mother. \u201cI won\u2019t stop.\u201d Old lady Wang\u2019s finger was about to touch Wang Shijing\u2019s nose. \u201cHand over everything you were given and from now on I don\u2019t have a son like you!\u201dShao Yunan snickered in his heart, so the root cause was here. Originally, it would be nice for a man with two children to marry. So why did the Wang family force Wang Shijing to marry him? The original didn\u2019t get any money from him and he probably didn\u2019t even want his dowry. Shao Yunan\u2019s eyes were full of sympathy when he looked at Wang Shijing. Having these people as family members, this person was also unlucky enough.The veins on Lizheng\u2019s forehead pulsed, but old lady Wang was not ashamed. She not only did not receive any benefits from this marriage but also lost money. How could this happen? The first person to speak up was Wang Wenhe, who was quicker than her. Wang Wenhe said, \u201cWhat is the story of your life, Shijing\u2019s wife? It\u2019s your Shao family\u2019s business and we Wang clan don\u2019t care about it. Now that you are married to Shijing, you are Shijing\u2019s person. I ask you, do you want this marriage?\u201dShao Yunan shrugged. \u201cI married a chicken, so I need to follow the chicken.\u201d Blah blah blah! Wang Wenhe nodded and looked at Wang Shijing. \u201cShijing, you\u2019re not going to return this marriage, are you?\u201d\u201cHe is my wife.\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s attitude was firm. Wang Wenhe nodded again and continued to say, \u201cAlthough you have separated from the family, it is written in the deed that you have to pay 500 coins a month to support your parents and 200 coins for Zhisong study. You also have to help with farming when the farm is busy and pay a dowry when your sister gets married. Now, your mother wants you to divorce your wife and if you don\u2019t want to, then you should return all the land you were assigned. In the same way, you will no longer bear these conditions and we can rewrite the deed of separation.\u201dWang Wenhe has always been on the side of old lady Wang, but this time he was also angry at old lady Wang\u2019s nonsense. His attitude seemed to be helping old lady Wang, but in fact it was also helping Wang Shijing get out of the family completely.\u201cThat won\u2019t do!\u201d Old lady Wang was the first to say no. She would lose several taels of silver a year and would lose a fortune when her daughter got married.Lizheng couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cEveryone is watching here! Do you want Chunxiu to be unable to get married in the future?\u201dWang Wenhe also held back his temper and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, then you can\u2019t take back Shijing\u2019s fields. If Shijing has no more fields, he should no longer be burdened with paying you. Zhisong is qualified enough to be a scholar, but If word of this gets out, it won\u2019t do him any good. Even for the sake of Zhisong, you should have a good reputation!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Wang Dali, who has never been able to make a fart with three sticks, suddenly made a sound. Old lady Wang\u2019s eyes become round. If she hadn\u2019t been watched by so many people, she would definitely have scratched the old man\u2019s face.Wang Dali looked at Wang Shijing, but there was no guilt for his son in his cloudy eyes. \u201cFrom now on, you will live your own life and whether it is good or bad, it will have nothing to do with the Wang family.\u201d\u201cDad!\u201d Wang Tianyan was not happy. If his elder brother did not take care of the fields, then he would be overworked again. He was still counting on his big brother to come back to work! Old lady Wang was also reluctant. Without Wang Shijing, there would be one less able worker and she was previously hoping to have more leisure time in the future when the farm was busy. When Wang Shijing was away from home in the past few years, she worked very hard. Wang Shijing said lightly, \u201cIn the years I was away, our family\u2019s life was also quite good, with me or without me. I am willing.\u201dLizheng said at the same time as Wang Wenhe, \u201cThen rewrite the deed.\u201d\u201cPatriarch!\u201d Old lady Wang and Wang Tianyan also spoke at the same time. Wang Wenhe glared at the two. \u201cWho is in charge of your family?\u201d Everyone in Xiushui village knows that old lady Wang was in charge of the family, but no matter how stupid old lady Wang was, she wouldn\u2019t dare to say she was in charge in front of everyone. Ruthlessly shooting Wang Dali a glance, old lady Wang sat down on the ground and began to howl. \u201cHow can I be so miserable ah\u2026 my son just married a daughter-in-law, but no longer wants this old mother. How can I be so miserable ah\u2026\u201d\u201cIf my mother doesn\u2019t want to, then I\u2019ll go to Zhisong.\u201d As soon as Wang Shijing\u2019s words fell, old lady Wang instantly stopped howling. Wang Shijing spoke again. \u201cThis matter started because of him, he is a scholar, let him judge.\u201d\u201cDo you want to make a scene until everyone in the county school knows about it?!\u201d Wang Wenhe pointed at old lady Wang and said angrily. When she thought of her third son, who could bring great prospects and glory to the Wang family in the future, old lady Wang also felt a little weak. Seeing this, Wang Wenhe immediately started to write the deed. The old woman stopped opposing, so Wang Tianyan also did not dare to make a fuss.During the separation, the Wang family gave Wang Shijing one mu of paddy field, two mu of dry land, two mu of sandy fields, an old house, a load of grain, and a few other miscellaneous items. The fields were inferior, but with old lady Wang, even giving this was stabbing her deep in the heart, which was agreed on by Wang Wenhe and Lizheng. At first, old lady Shao\u2019s idea was that the Shao family would give 20 taels of silver and also promised to give Shao Yunan a generous dowry, which was enough to make up for her losses. But now it was a real loss. If old lady Wang was not able to get the land and house back, she would absolutely be unable to eat and sleep.Wang Shijing was also a ruthless person and returned everything. He had just separated from the family a few days ago, so he didn\u2019t eat much food yet and replaced the eaten food with dry wood. Wang Wenhe and Lizheng both said that he didn\u2019t need to be so meticulous, but old lady Wang was silent. Wang Shijing said that he would give it all back, so old lady Wang accepted it all according to the order.Now everything was returned and Wang Shijing was completely separated. Because he was not allocated his share of any family property, old lady Wang and Wang Dali also would not need him to pay a pension and he would not take care of his sibling\u2019s things. To put it simply, Wang Shijing was no longer a part of the family. From now on, he would have nothing more to do with the Wang family and the Wang family\u2019s honor and disgrace become irrelevant to him.After taking the deed, Wang Shijing knelt down, kowtowed to his parents three times, then took Shao Yunan and left Lizheng\u2019s house. He could no longer live in the dilapidated old house that he had just been assigned, so Lizheng lent a dilapidated house in the village to Wang Shijing.

His name was Wang Xing.Wang Shijing said, \u201cSorry for troubling you.\u201d\u201cNo trouble.\u201dAlthough none of the three young men dared to look at Wang Shijing\u2019s horribly disfigured face, they were all people who had a good relationship with Wang Shijing in the past. It was also because Wang Shijing had not been back for a long time, so there was some sense of alienation between them. However, it\u2019s not difficult to see that with the passage of time, the relationship between these young men and Wang Shijing would return to normal.The three young men called the young people from their own family to help and soon finished moving the things to Wang Shijing\u2019s new house. Wang Shijing did not have much belongings, so most of it was Shao Yunan\u2019s dowry, which contained the five mahogany boxes. Naturally, when moving the dowry, there were a lot of onlookers and discussions. Most of the onlookers were women. For ordinary farmers, three boxes of dowry could be regarded as a big dowry, so how could these five boxes not be envied by the women. Shao Yunan really didn\u2019t like this kind of situation, but he could only put up with it for now. As soon as the things were moved, several families brought their own vegetables and some mixed grain noodles to them. Lizheng also asked his youngest son, Zhao Yuanqing, to send a bag of white noodles and two taels of silver.Xiushui Village was located at the border between the north and the south. Most of the grains in the north and south could be grown here. It\u2019s just that rice and white noodles were expensive, so farmers seldom ate them on weekdays. They all sold them for money and taxes, so most of the grain was usually mixed. Zhao Yuanqing sent white noodles and Wang Shijing accepted them, but still returned the two silver. Later, Wang Wenhe also sent his son Wang Shiping with white noodles and some vegetables.Wang\u2019s family affairs have long been known all over the village, coupled with the fact that it happened today, many villagers were quite disdainful of old lady Wang\u2019s family. But the Wang family had a talented male student and there was a great possibility that he could become a scholar. So even if people were dissatisfied, they didn\u2019t dare to speak out and only discussed it in private, afraid to offend old lady Wang\u2019s family. This was why Wang Wenhe, as the patriarch who saw clearly that old lady Wang did not treat Wang Shijing as her eldest son, did not interfere more, not wanting to offend a possible official family. For the clan\u2019s glory and prosperity, Wang Wenhe, as patriarch of the Wang clan, selfishly placed the future of the Wang family on Wang Zhisong, the third son of the Wang family.By the time all the work was done, the sun was already in the west. The house had not been inhabited for a long time, so the dampness was heavy. Although autumn had just begun, Shao Yunan asked Wang Shijing to start the kang to warm up the house. There were still many things to be done. Shao Yunan hadn\u2019t recovered yet and after a busy day, he boiled a few corn to pad his stomach, but he was too lazy to cook and there was nothing else to do. Wang Shijing and the two children quietly nibbled the corn. The two children bowed their heads and did not speak, emitting uneasiness and nervousness.When he finished eating, Shao Yunan clapped his hands and said to Wang Shijing, \u201cI want to take a bath, help me to boil the water. I don\u2019t know how to start the fire.\u201d Not noticing the doubt in Wang Shijing\u2019s eyes, Shao Yunan looked at the two children again and added, \u201cBoil more water. We all should wash properly.\u201d Not to mention how dirty Wang Shijing and the two children were, Shao Yunan himself could not stand the dirt on his body. Despite the fact that old lady Wang\u2019s family was regarded as a rich family in the village, old lady Wang and her son were not much cleaner. The cleanliness of these two children was not much different from that of beggars in Shao Yunan\u2019s eyes.Wang Shijing did not comment on Shao Yunan\u2019s \u2018poor manners\u2019 and left after finishing eating the boiled corn, to boil water for Shao Yunan. As soon as Wang Shijing left, the two children\u2019s bodies tensed up. Shao Yunan with elbows on his knees said, \u201cAlthough I married your father, I am also a man. I will not abuse you like those stepmothers so you don\u2019t need to be afraid of me. You just need to think of it as having an additional father, well dad. If I divorce your father in the future, your father might marry another one, then you can be afraid.\u201dThe two children looked up in surprise, then looked at Shao Yunan. Shao Yunan said, \u201cMy name is Shao Yunan and this year, I am sixteen years old.\u201d\u00a0Just sixteen years old. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name? How old are you?\u201dThe girl nervously bit her lips next to her brother. The boy was a little more daring and put his arm around his sister and said, \u201cMy name is Wang Qing, I\u2019m six years old. My sister\u2019s name is Wang Ni, four years old.\u201dA six-year-old and four-year-old, looking much thinner than their actual age. Shao Yunan could also understand it. Even in modern society, rural children are less developed than urban children, let alone here. Shao Yunan asked again, \u201cDo you go to school?\u201d Go to school? The two children were a bit confused. Shao Yunan asked weakly, \u201cDo you learn to read?\u201dThe older brother, Wang Qing, lowered his head and shook it. Wang Ni did not respond either. Shao Yunan was puzzled. He remembered that the fat woman seemed to say that her son was in school, right? Children here usually go to private school from the age of 8 to 14, but before that, people who have the conditions will first find someone to teach their children, how to recognize words and so on. Rich people would also invite private tutors to their homes, while ordinary people will find people who can read and pay a little money or send some things for teaching. This was not a formal way to study, nor did you have to go there every day. Just going once every few days, equivalent to the early education class. But the people who could do this were very few, even if the tuition fee for early education was very low, it was still money. Even sending food costs some money.Wang Zaizheng was a year younger than Wang Qing, but he could go to class. Wang Zaizheng should be able to read too\u2026 It could be seen that old lady Wang\u2019s family had some capital. Shao Yunan looked in the direction of the kitchen, Wang Shijing was still inside.\u00a0 It seemed that he would not be able to take a bath for a while so Shao Yunan turned back to continue to cultivate feelings with the two children.\u201cI heard your second aunt say that her son\u00a0is going to the reading class, right?\u201dWang Ni held her brother\u2019s hand tightly. Wang Qing bit his lips hard and just said in very low voice, \u201cGrandma said I am stupid so teaching me how to read would be a waste of money. But my cousin is smart.\u201d\u201cThen who does your cousin study with?\u201d\u201cWith uncle.\u201dWang Ni added, \u201cLittle Uncle is also going to uncle for classes.\u201dShao Yunan asked, \u201cThen is uncle your grandmother\u2019s brother or younger brother?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the younger brother.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cIn Dashan Village.\u201dDashan Village was a little far away from Xiushui Village but this old lady Wang\u2019s family still had a scholar? It was too unscientific. Shao Yunan raised his hand and rubbed Wang Qing\u2019s dirty head. \u201cDo you want to study?\u201d He will be seven years old next year, so it should be no problem if he goes to the private school one year in advance. Wang Qing raised his head abruptly with longing in his eyes. But this longing vanished in a twinkling of an eye.\u201cReading, it\u2019s very costly.\u201d Wang Qing lowered his head again.\u201cRaise your head. It\u2019s only polite to look at the person you are talking with.\u201dWang Qing\u2019s body shook as he lifted his head. Shao Yunan asked Wang Ni this time. \u201cSo, Xiao Ni, do you also want to go to school?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shao Yunan\u2019s mouth twitched. He had forgotten about it. The little girl who he called \u2018Xiao Ni\u2019 shrank shyly into her brother\u2019s arms.Wang Shijing sat down on the small bench and said, \u201cThe water will take a while to boil. Take some eggs and cook them if you are hungry. I will go to the county tomorrow and do some shopping.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go together.\u201d Shao Yunan looked at the two children dressed in patched rags. \u201cI haven\u2019t been there yet.\u201d The two children looked at their father expectantly, but with some caution, making Shao Yunan quite puzzled. Making him wonder if Wang Shijing was not a competent father. Wang Shijing nodded, \u201cLet\u2019s go together. We will have to get up early tomorrow.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dWang Ni grabbed her brother\u2019s hand, unconcealed joy on her face. Wang Qing pursed his lips, but there was also unconcealed happiness in his eyes. The two children looked like they were abused. Shao Yunan skimmed his mouth at Wang Shijing, got up and went into the house. He hasn\u2019t seen what his dowry has yet. The \u2018dowry\u2019 of grass!\u203bShao Yunan was a typical rich and handsome man. His parents are both only children. Perhaps because of it, they would rather be fined than have only one child. Shao Yunan also has a brother and a sister, and his grandparents of both sides were also living with them. It could be said that he was extremely favored at home. Father Shao started his own business early, while mother Shao was a fashion designer. By the time Shao Yunan was born, the living conditions of the Shao family could be regarded as rich.Shao Yunan grew up with the love and affection of his grandparents, brother, and sister. After graduating from high school, he was sent by his family to study abroad and came back after four years. Thanks to his childhood hobby, he then opened his own tea house, wineries, and restaurants thanks to his friends\u2019 investment, so his life was quite unrestrained. The Shao family\u2019s only concern for him was his sexuality. Shao Yunan was born a gay or a pure zero. If not for the fact that he lacked feminine flavor, father and mother Shao might have cried themselves to death.Shao Yunan has never been short of money since he was a child and he could also make money himself. He had no pressure to inherit the family business and his elder brother and sister were not interested in his small business. His elder sister also spoiled him while married to a tycoon husband. Shao Yunan thought he was quite rich, but in his sister\u2019s eyes, he was just a poor man that needed to be given \u2018subsidies.\u2019 His elder brother and sister always competed in making money and his sister would often buy this or that before sending it to him. He himself was also able to earn money, so it resulted in his philosophy of life that money should be earned to make life more enjoyable.Noble or vulgar, as long as Shao Yunan thought he would enjoy it he would go and try it. He would go to stay in a seven-star hotel or carry a big bag on his back as he hiked in the mountains. His attitude towards life became even more unscrupulous after his eldest brother and sister got married and had a baby one after another. After that, since the Shao family could not \u2018cure\u2019 his aptitude, they let him do whatever he wanted.Living recklessly until the age of 26, Shao Yunan did not expect that his life would have such a big turnaround. He was just going to buy a bottle of water when he ran into a firefight in the street. He didn\u2019t know who had the guts to use a gun on the street, but the bullet hit a wall and bounced back, right into Shao Yunan\u2019s body.Shao Yunan died, but was now alive again. Now he is an ancient man who had the same name thousands of years ago. Even their appearance was similar. The only thing was, that he shrank from the height of 180 cm to less than 170. His age also changed from 26 to 16, but it was not bad. The problem was that he was married\u2026 married to a man.The State of Yan, was not the same State of Yan Shao Yunan learned about in history books, so he understood it could be another dimension with a different version of the history of a Chinese dynasty. In this State of Yan, men could not only marry women, but also men. The difference was that women had a higher chance of conceiving than men and women could give birth more often than men. Many men who choose to marry other men could not have children in their lifetime. Even if they were able to, they would have at most two children in their lifetime. But even such men were a very small minority and the vast majority could only conceive one child. Therefore, although both men and women could marry, most people still preferred to marry a woman.In this life, Shao Yunan was the second son of the Shao family, with an older brother Shao Dahu and a younger sister Shao Zhen. The Wang family\u2019s side had three sons and one daughter. The eldest son was Wang Shijing, the second son Wang Tianyan, the third child was a daughter, called Wang Chunxiu, and the youngest child, Wang Zhisong, had just turned fifteen. There was a difference of two years between Wang Shijing and Wang Tianyan. Wang Shijing was 26 years old this year and was ten years older than Shao Yunan here, the same age as Shao Yunan from modern times. It could be said that old lady Wang was very capable of giving birth. Wang Chunxiu was seventeen this year and was not yet engaged, but old lady Wang decided to choose one carefully. Now that Wang Zhisong was on the road to becoming a scholar, although Wang Chunxiu was a bit older, her bride price also rose.The story goes that when Wang Zhisong was thirteen years old, he got a strange disease and the family spent a lot of money to heal him, but nothing worked. Later, old lady Wang found a witch doctor from nowhere and the other side said that Wang Zhisong was suffering from an evil disease and they needed to find a person with the same birth date as his for marriage to get rid of evil spirits. Old lady Wang was eager to save her child. Not to mention that he was the most promising son of the Wang family, so she asked around for someone with the same birth date as Wang Zhisong. Looking around she found the Shao family. Shaojia Village was not too far from Wangjia Village, so when she learned that Shao Yunan, the second son of the Shao family, had the same characters as Wang Zhisong, old lady Wang came to their door.The Shao family refused at first. Although a man could marry a man, it was still not as good as marrying a woman. Besides, Shao Yunan was still young and the Shao family\u2019s situation was not worse than the Wang family\u2019s. Old lady Wang gritted her teeth and asked the Shao family to make an offer for Wang Zhisong\u2019s betrothal. Old lady Shao stated 50 taels of silver. Old lady Wang at that time had already spent a large amount of silver for Wang Zhisong\u2019s medical treatment. She also sold five mu of land and gathered more money from the clan before she finally made the engagement with Shao Yunan. Oddly enough, Wang Zhisong gradually got better after his engagement to Shao Yunan. After a year of rest and recuperation at home, Wang Zhisong was completely cured. But by this time, old lady Wang started to have problems with the marriage. Her son was going to be a scholar in the future, how could he marry a man from a farming family? Not to mention that the other side was a year older than her son?\u00a0 Of course, there was also no lack of hatred for old lady Shao who took\u00a0 advantage of the fire.Old lady Wang didn\u2019t like it, but old lady Shao was also not easy to mess with. Coupled with the whole Shaojia village, old lady Wang didn\u2019t dare to do anything about it. But when Wang Zhisong was formally admitted as a student and stepped into the door of examination, old lady Wang could not quieten the discontent in her heart any longer. She did not like this marriage! No one knows who gave old lady Wang the idea that Shao Yunan\u2019s eight characters were false. The Shao family\u2019s head Shao Min had taken his wife and children outside for work for seven or eight years and when he returned Shao Yunan was already five years old. Shao Dahu and Shao Yunan\u2019s sister Shao Zhen were born in Shao\u2019s village, but not Shao Yunan. Old lady Wang concentrated on this point and said that the Shao family cheated the eight characters, because no one could prove that Shao Yunan was born at that time.Wang Zhisong also rejected the marriage in his heart. He and Shao Yunan were just engaged. He didn\u2019t even see the other person, so when his mother said that she wanted to withdraw from the marriage, he immediately agreed. Old lady Wang wanted to withdraw from the marriage but old lady Shao didn\u2019t agree. Wang Zhisong grew up smart and since he was five years old he attended a private school. The teacher from the private school said that he was intelligent and would be able to gain fame in the future. Everyone thought that Wang Zhisong may be able to become a scholar in the future, so how could such a good marriage be withdrawn.The Shao family didn\u2019t agree and neither did Shaojia Village. If you wanted to marry the people in their village you could, but if you wanted to withdraw, how can their village girl or boy get married later? It was simply too humiliating. The patriarch of the Shao family and a group of Shaojia villagers followed old lady Shao and Shao Dahu to the Wang family house. Old lady Wang accused the Shao family of cheating on the eight characters, but the Shao family could not come up with the household registration certificate issued by the county government when Shao Yunan was born. Without the civil registration certificate, there was no birth certificate stamped by the government at the time of birth, similar to the modern birth certificate.Neither side would give in, so when the both side were at an impasse, Shao Yunan tried to commit suicide by jumping into the river. This time human life was involved, so old lady Wang became scared. The good thing was that he was saved and the patriarchs on both sides came forward. Finally both sides reached an agreement that Shao Yunan would still marry into the Wang family. Not to Wang Zhisong, but to Shijing, the eldest son of the Wang family. Wang Shijing had two children, but his wife had run away with another man. This was the first marriage for Shao Yunan, so old lady Shao proposed that if Shao Yunan married him, that son should be in charge of the family. Accordingly, the Shao family would prepare a generous dowry.Old lady Wang had her own ideas. When someone gets married, can he take charge of the family just by saying so? The same goes for the married son, as well as the married daughter. When the time comes, the family would have more labor force, not to mention a rich dowry so she agreed. The dowry was private property and even the husband couldn\u2019t take it, let alone the mother-in-law. But old lady Wang didn\u2019t care. If you married into the Wang family, you became part of the Wang family. So there was no private property, only public property. Old lady Wang had met Shao Yunan several times and did not believe that she could not hold down that soft-tempered man.Old lady Wang agreed, but did not ask her son Wang Shijing for his opinion. Wang Shijing immediately said he would not marry. No matter how much old lady Wang scolded him, he didn\u2019t change his opinion. It would be the second marriage for Wang Shijing, so there was no matchmaker\u2019s words from his parents. If he didn\u2019t want to marry, no one could force him to. Because of this, old lady Wang tried to force him in all kinds of ways. Finally, Wang Shijing agreed on the condition that he could separate from the family. As long as he could separate, he would marry. No matter how old lady Wang called her son unfilial, heartless, and so on, Wang Shijing made up his mind to marry only if he can separate from the Wang family.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wang Shijing was the eldest son of the Wang family, but in the Wang family, he seemed to be almost raised by a stepfather and a stepmother. Wang Shijing only got married at the age of nineteen to a girl of the same age (an older young woman) from Qingshan Village, a neighboring village. The Song family was also a very poor, casual household in Qingshan Village. If Wang Tianyan had not been in a hurry to get married and the Song family was not found by Wang Shijing himself, old lady Wang would not have agreed to this marriage. But being poor has the advantage of being poor. Old lady Wang needed to spend only 200 coins to marry the Song family\u2019s daughter. As a result, Wang Shijing and the Song family\u2019s daughter weren\u2019t even married for two months before Shijing was taken to serve in the army. If old lady Wang was willing to pay three taels of silver, Wang Shijing would not have to go, but old lady Wang said that their family had no money and Wang Tianyan was not qualified, because he was not married yet and forced Wang Shijing to leave his newlywed wife. After Wang Shijing left, Wang Tianyan got married.At that time, the imperial court was building rivers, fortifications, and many other major projects. Usually service took two or three months, but Wang Shijing worked for two years before returning. He was so thin and dull that he looked even worse than before, making old lady Wang dislike her eldest son even more. When Wang Shijing came back, his eldest son Wang Qing was one year old and there were rumors in the village that Wang Qing was not Wang Shijing\u2019s son. He just got married and left within two months, his wife shouldn\u2019t be able to have a child so soon.Wang Shijing did not react to this and continued to live his life as usual with Song. Old lady Wang never liked her son, but as Wang Shijing grew up, she didn\u2019t dare to scold him as much as she used to. Wang Shijing was the tallest and strongest in the Wang family. In addition, he came back a lot more gloomier, so old lady Wang didn\u2019t even want to talk with him anymore. With her husband by her side, Song, who was usually bullied by her mother-in-law and younger siblings and aunts, started to live much better. Within two years, Song gave birth to a daughter, Wang Ni, but the good times came to an end again. This time the imperial court drafted soldiers and Wang Shijing and Wang Tianyan both met the conditions for the draft.Wang Shijing had served in the military for more than a year and according to the law, if there were brothers in the family who met the requirements, they were not required to serve in the military again so Wang Tianyan became the first candidate for the draft from the Wang family. But old lady Wang refused to let him go, saying that Wang Tianyan was not well and would not survive if he went. Wang Tianyan also cried and refused to go. Old lady Wang forced Wang Shijing to go again, but Wang Shijing refused to go. Old lady Wang used filial piety and said that Wang Shijing was the eldest so he should protect his younger brother and sister, but Wang Shijiang was still unmoved. Old lady Wang refused to take out the money and refused to let Wang Tianyan go, so in the end she went directly to the place where the soldiers were drafted and wrote Wang Shijing\u2019s name on the roster, so Wang Shijing was directly taken away.This time he has been gone for three years. He joined the army for three years and fought for two and a half years. When Wang Shijing came back this time, he was faced with two children who did not have enough to eat and nothing to wear. The year after he became a soldier, his wife eloped with another man, because she was not able to stand the bullying at home. Wang Shijing became more sullen and gloomy. With one eye missing and his face disfigured, Wang Shijing went to the country magistrate and handed in a letter of divorce. He did not blame his wife for running away with someone else. With this letter of divorce, even if Song returned in the future, she would not be punished by the clan and her status in the family register would be changed to single and divorced. After returning for only seven or eight days, Wang Shijing was once again forced by his own mother, this time to marry Shao Yunan whose marriage had been rejected by his brother. This time, Wang Shijing traded his marriage for his freedom. If they wanted him to marry, he could, but first he wanted to separate from the Wang family.This time, Lizheng and Wang Wenhe, the patriarch of the Wang clan could not stand it anymore and intervened to reconcile. Old lady Wang agreed to the separation of the family, but asked Wang Shijing not to say anything before the marriage. The Shao family had given their word that if the Wang family ruined the marriage again, they would go to the county school. Wang Zhisong was studying in the county school. For the sake of Wang Zhisong\u2019s reputation, old lady Wang did not dare to take risks. The old woman gave Wang Shijing five mu of land, including two mu of the worst rice fields. The other three mu were also inferior. The Wang family had twenty-seven mu of fields, so dividing these five would not kill old lady Wang.In the Wang family, Wang Dali was the nominal head of the family, but in reality, he did not care or worry about anything. The eldest son Wang Shijing was so battered by his mother, but he seemed not to see it and didn\u2019t say a word. His eldest daughter-in-law\u00a0 was also bullied by his wife to the point of being unable to live, but he also didn\u2019t say anything. Old lady Wang was not good to Wang Shijing and Wang Dali, the head of the family was also not good. In modern words, it would be called cold blooded violence. Wang Dali would also talk to Wang Tianyan and Wang Zhisong, but he rarely spoke to Wang Shijing.Wang Shijing agreed to marry Shao Yunan after signing the deed of separation. While Shao Yunan who attempted to commit suicide, seemed to have lost his soul. Fearing that there would be more trouble, the Shao family quickly set a wedding date with the Wang family and married them just three days later, without even choosing an auspicious day. The Shao family did not even tell Shao Yunan who he was going to marry. Fearing that Shao Yunan would find out the truth on the day of the wedding, old lady Shao drugged Shao Yunan. Shao Yunan got married in a daze, not even knowing what his husband looked like.Shao Yunan got married, but the Shao family found that Wang Shijing got separated from the Wang family. The Shao family resisted again. They married Shao Yunan to the Wang family to connect with Wang Zhisong. But they couldn\u2019t do it if the family was separated! The Shao family said that the Wang family cheated the terms of the marriage and wanted the Wang family to pay for it. But since Shao Yunan had already gotten married, old lady Wang had nothing to fear. In addition, after Shao Yunan\u2019s marriage, Wang Shijing directly received Shao Yunan\u2019s dowry into his old house, giving old lady Wang a chance to make a move. For this marriage, old lady Wang paid three silver for the bride price, but did not get even a coin in return. So old lady Wang, who had nothing to lose, also followed the Shao family. This was the trouble Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing went to solve at the beginning.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He died before he was rescued, but later came back to life. However, the one to come back to life was the Shao Yunan who lived recklessly and was accidentally killed by a stray bullet. The reason why he was faint at that time was because the original body owner was not feeling well, after all he had really died. Another reason was because Shao Yunan received all the memories of the original body owner. Added to his own memories, it made him confused. In addition, he was also drugged by old lady Shao.No one knows what Wang Shijing thought of this marriage or Shao Yunan. After Shao Yunan entered the door, Wang Shijing did not touch him, making Shao Yunan lay alone in the bed for two whole days before he recovered. He had just recovered when the Wang family came to his door.Shao Yunan was annoyed. He never met shrews like old lady Wang or old lady Shao, in his childhood or adult experience His only impression of the countryside was farmhouses, but there were not even decent roads. Let alone cow shit, there was dog shit and human shit everywhere? The gossipy women whispered behind him.Shao Yunan was very annoyed. He was a gay and a pure zero. Yes, he was not against marriage, but he refused to have children! He also didn\u2019t know if he had eaten that pregnancy fruit. In the original Shao Yunan\u2019s memory, he didn\u2019t, so Shao Yunan could only comfort himself with that. Moreover, even if he was a gay and pure zero, he has never engaged in a one-night stand. He had two boyfriends before, but he quickly split up with them, because they didn\u2019t feel right. He wanted a marriage for love, not for venting physical urges.He wasn\u2019t dissatisfied with Wang Shijing because he only had one eye or was disfigured, nor because he already had two children. The most irreconcilable conflict between him and Wang Shijing was that there will never be a common language between the two of them! No common language and completely different living environment and upbringing. If it was modern society two such people would even have difficulty getting along together, let alone thousands of years in the past in another dimension.Shao Yunan was annoyed. This was not a world where you could run around with only your ID card and wallet. Here, the household registration was quite strict and since he was now Wang Shijing\u2019s wife, his household registration fell under Wang Shijing\u2019s name. If Wang Shijing doesn\u2019t release him, he couldn\u2019t just leave. Even if Wang Shijing divorced him, he would have nowhere to go. In addition, this was a feudal society that ate people without spitting out bones and had a very strict hierarchy. He also knew nothing about this place, so there was no guarantee that he wouldn\u2019t lose his life if he went outside and messed with someone he shouldn\u2019t mess with. The safest thing for him was to live with Wang Shijing and think of a way to make money first. Then he could think of a way to change his social status and leave.At this time, Shao Yunan still didn\u2019t know what had happened to Wang Shijing. But since he made the decision to settle here first, Shao Yunan wouldn\u2019t let himself stay in poverty like this. Scooping up a ladle of hot water and letting it run down his head, he took a deep breath. Let\u2019s make money first.Taking advantage of the time to take a bath to sort out his thoughts, suppressing his thoughts and guilt for his parents, Shao Yunan wiped his body and put on the clean underwear he pulled out from his dowry. The first thing he will do with the money he earns is to buy a big bathtub! Well, he was afraid that this place didn\u2019t have anything as fancy as a bathtub, but there still must be some type of bathtub.The house that Lizheng lent to Wang Shijing was a bit dilapidated, but there were still three rooms, a separate courtyard with walls and gates, and a front and back yard that was not too small. So it could be considered that Lizheng was helping Wang Shijing. After dressing, Shao Yunan looked out through the doorway, but no one was there. His bathing place was the kitchen, because there was no separate bathroom and there was a stove in the kitchen, so it wouldn\u2019t be too cold. It was September, so after the mid-autumn Festival, the days would become cooler. Morning and evening would also soon become even colder.After Wang Shijing boiled water for him, he went into the house together with the two children to clean up in another room. Blowing out the oil lamp, Shao Yunan waited for a while longer, but heard only the sound of crickets outside. Everything was quiet. Until the fire in the stove was extinguished, his eyes shone in the darkness of the night, then in a blink of an eye he disappeared from the place he stood.Night turned into day, with the sun hanging high in the sky. Only farmland could be seen, but the fields were bare without anything planted on them. Shao Yunan, who had suddenly changed location, didn\u2019t panic. He was relaxed and even a bit excited.\u201cMy space is still there!\u201dTears flowed from Shao Yunan\u2019s eyes. If he hadn\u2019t just taken a shower, he would definitely have knelt down and kissed the ground beneath his feet.Shao Yunan had been hiding a secret since he was thirteen. During summer vacation when he was twelve, he and his family went to a famous Buddhist shrine to offer incense. They were actually there for fun, so after they arrived at the destination, he went off to play alone. He didn\u2019t know how he got there, but he walked into a small forest where no one was around. There was a big tree in the woods that was very particular. At that time, Shao Yunan did not know what kind of tree it was, but only knew that the hole in the tree was big enough to sit down alone, because there was an old monk sitting there.The old monk was kind-eyed and smiled at him when he saw him. He told him that they were destined to meet and then gave Shao Yunan a jade pendant. The jade pendant was not different from and didn\u2019t look much different from the ones offered by the master in the temple. But out of reverence and respect for Buddhism, Shao Yunan sincerely thanked and bowed. Leaving the woods, he found his parents and elder brother and told them about it. He then took out the jade pendant to show his family. His parents immediately said he had met a master and hurriedly took him to find the master, but only found the empty tree hole. Then Shao Yunan learned that the big tree was called Linden.Since then, Shao Yunan became more respectful of places like temples. He did not believe in Buddhism, but was in awe of such eminent monks. He also wore the jade pendant around his neck all the time. The next year, Shao Yunan went to an amusement park and fell from a high height. The jade pendant shattered, but he was fine. There was also a magical space hidden in his body. Like most space novels, his space has a spiritual spring, a cluster of spiritual stones, and a fertile field, but no house.Shao Yunan did not dare to let anyone know about this, not even his own parents, brother, or sister. If this accidentally spread, it would absolutely be the end, so Shao Yunan only dared to quietly use the spiritual spring water and spirit essence for his family. Outsiders had no choice but to wonder how the Shao family took care of themselves to look healthier and younger the longer they lived. But no one knew that the Shao family\u2019s physique had been quietly changed by Shao Yunan.Coming to this primitive foreign world, Shao Yunan did not expect that his space would also follow him. But many of the things in the space that he had stored inside were gone. Once, his space had large vines and large tea plants, but now they were all gone. The size of the spiritual spring was also reduced by half, and was only about 20 square meters in size. The size of the spiritual stones that produced spirit essence had also become smaller. The small wooden hut that he had built with his own hands was also gone, but the things he stored in the space were still there. The land area in the space had also shrunk a bit. From what he could tell, it was at most now 20 mu, from 50. However, if he also covered the other areas of this world, there were nearly 40 mu.Shao Yunan found a jade bottle from his storage and placed it under the spiritual essence stone, so spiritual essence could drip inside. The spiritual essence dripped very slowly and the number of drops was also very small. Thankfully he didn\u2019t need to be here for it to drop, so he didn\u2019t need to be here all the time. In his current state, drinking a drop of spiritual essence would definitely make an earth-shaking change, so he had to be careful. But he could still use the spiritual spring water. The effect of the spiritual water was not as good as the spiritual essence and could even be considered mild. He then found an instant noodle and wolfed it down, before drinking a glass of spiritual spring water and a bottle of milk, which made his body feel much better.\u00a0 Hastily leaving the space, Shao Yunan felt much better. As long as the space was still there, he would not die of hunger, so he gained some courage to live here.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As soon as the door was pushed open, someone said, \u201cIt\u2019s late. Let\u2019s go to sleep.\u201dIn the dim light, Shao Yunan saw that Wang Shijiang was already lying down. At a distance of one person from him another quilt was laid neatly, a big red wedding quilt from Shao Yunan\u2019s dowry. Wang Shijing also washed and scrubbed himself properly. Having been dirty in the morning when he separated from his family, he was finally in the mood to take care of himself.Shao Yunan was quite satisfied with Wang Shijing\u2019s self-consciousness. Although he\u00a0was a pure zero, it doesn\u2019t mean that he wasn\u2019t a man. He was not in the mood for romance. Closing the door and putting the lamp on the broken wooden table, Shao Yunan blew out the oil lamp and climbed into the bed in the dark.Because he just drank spiritual water, Shao Yunan wasn\u2019t sleepy. This dark, dilapidated house has a musty smell that hinted it wasn\u2019t lived in from a long time. The bed was also very hard but the bedding was very clean and new. After all they just got married, so old lady Wang had to prepare two new quilts. No matter if Wang Shijing was already asleep or not, Shao Yunan said, \u201cIf you go to the country town tomorrow, do you have any money?\u201dA few seconds later, he heard the response.\u201cYes. We will get by this year and after we save some money ,we can buy this piece of land next year or build a new house. \u201cWang Shijing did not have any land but Shao Yunan did not ask him how he would earn money so he only said: \u201cYou and I do not know each other well, but I want to treat you as head of family and husband but I can\u2019t do it yet. You and I can get along as brothers at first. You and I are in the same boat. I will help you share the burden of this family and take care of your children, but you have to promise me that you won\u2019t force me.\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s voice was very flat. \u201cIf you have someone you like, I will write you a letter of divorce. This marriage, I also used you.\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s answer was a bit unexpected to Shao Yunan, so he turned his face in the shadow suddenly becoming interested. \u201cHey, I don\u2019t understand. Your parents\u2026 oh\u2026 why are your parents treating you so badly? Did they bring you in just like me?\u201d In the darkness, Wang Shijing tilted his head slightly and asked, \u201cYou were brought in?\u201d He still hasn\u2019t forgotten what Shao Yunan had said during the day.Shao Yunan said, \u201cI think I was brought in. Anyway, it wasn\u2019t from a proper channel, so I don\u2019t remember whose family I belonged to and how I ended up in the Shao family. But I have secretly heard old lady Shao and old man Shao complaining that they should not have brought me in or saying they should have sold me earlier. According to what they said, they didn\u2019t bring me in for a good reason. Old lady Wang was right about one thing, my eight characters are false and just something that the Shao family made up. It was just a fluke that the eight characters they made up just met the needs of your third brother.\u201dIn the dark Wang Shijing wrinkled his eyebrows, not minding Shao Yunan\u2019s name for his own mother. The State of Yan imposed a heavy penalty on the sale of children from good families. Even during the famine years, it was not allowed to buy and sell children from good families; they only dared to buy and sell them in private and once they were found out they would be exiled or beheaded. The original Shao Yunan knew he was not properly adopted, but because of his personality and environment, did not think about it too much. But the \u2018him\u2019 whose memories fused with the original Shao Yunan easily thought of this point. He was not familiar with the laws of the State of Yan, but he still knew some of them thanks to the original body owner\u2019s memories. It\u2019s just that the original body owner did not remember where he came from, so Shao Yunan was unable to help the original body owner get justice and it was still unknown whether he can gain a secure foothold in this world.\u201cDo you want to find your real parents?\u201d Wang Shijing asked.\u201cI have no such intention. If we meet in the future, we can talk about it. Who knows what happened back then. I don\u2019t want to make a big deal about it, but the Shao family will make trouble about it anyway. If this matter was stirred up and brought to the attention of the government, how much impact will it have?\u201dWang Shijing said truthfully. \u201cThe Shao family would at least be exiled. Shao\u2019s family patriarch can also not escape and would be sentenced for at least five years. You can go to sue them.\u201dThe ancient population was not prosperous in the first place. In recent years, the State of Yan also had mandatory military service due to the war. The population gap became even greater, so the punishment for the sale of children from a good family became even more heavy.Shao Yunan said, \u201cThis is enough to handle them. If they don\u2019t have eyes and try to mess with me again, I will let them learn a lesson. I don\u2019t remember where I came from, so even if I won the case, my life would still be a mess. As long as they\u2019re smart enough, I\u2019ll let them off the hook for now.\u201d After a pause, he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhat about you? You still haven\u2019t said what\u2019s going on with you. Are you their real son?\u201dWang Shijing became silent. Shao Yunan didn\u2019t expect the other man to reveal his heart to him right away, so he just turned around and laid down. After a long time, just as Shao Yunan was ready to fall asleep, he heard a low voice near him. \u201cI also want to know if I am their real son.\u201dThe melancholy and sadness in these words caused Shao Yunan\u2019s heart to tremble inexplicably, sniffing softly he said, \u201cIf you regret it, it may still not be too late.\u201d\u201cNo regrets.\u201d Wang Shijing rolled over, turning his back to Shao Yunan. \u201cGo to sleep. You have to get up early tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dShao Yunan also rolled over. Turning his back he thought, \u2018This kind of family can\u2019t be happy.\u2019\u203bEdited by: JaislandProofreader:Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He got up from the bed and rubbed his sore back, this bed was really to hard.Wang Shijing got up at some point and boiled hot water and cooked breakfast. Breakfast was very simple, corn flour paste with large cakes and pickles. The cakes and pickles were sent by the kind-hearted villagers yesterday. After washing, Shao Yunan sat down to eat. Yesterday he made rules with the other three members of the family, to wash hands before and after meals, brush their teeth in the morning and evening, wash their faces before going to bed, wash their feet at night, and take a bath at least once every three days. The three did not object to this, but it was true that the two children were a little afraid of their \u2018stepmother.\u2019While eating, Shao Yunan said to Wang Shijing: \u201cDo you remember who sent things yesterday?\u00a0 We need to have a chance to repay them later. They were sending charcoal in the snow. Well, these pickles are quite fragrant, I wonder whose family it is from.\u201dWang Shijing spoke. \u201cI remember that these pickles were sent by aunt Wang Liu. She is the mother of Wang Xing. Wang Xing was the man who asked me if I wanted help yesterday. The people surnamed Wang in the village are all related. Wang Xing\u2019s family and my family are one of five siblings. Uncle was fourth, so you can directly call him fourth uncle in the future, as well as fourth aunt when you see them. Wang Xing is one year younger than me. When we meet someone else later, I will tell you.\u201dShao Yunan nodded. He had an impression of that young man. As long as you were married here, both men and women would take the surname of the husband\u2019s family. Sometimes, in order to facilitate the difference, the original surname would be added during the introduction, especially in the countryside where there were many people of the same clan.Shao Yunan was a little depressed. \u201cSo, I am changing my name to Wang Shao now?\u201dWang Shijing said, \u201cYou have not yet entered the family tree, so there is no need to change it. If you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll write your name in the genealogy, but you will have to take my last name.\u00a0Neither\u00a0Qing nor Ni have been listed in the genealogy, so when I finish my work at home I will go to see the patriarch.\u201dWith the traditional and old-fashioned way of thinking of ancient people, Wang Shijing\u2019s words were rather open-minded and Shao Yunan knew that he couldn\u2019t ask for too much. Thinking about it, if he really \u2018married\u2019 Wang\u00a0Zhisong\u2019 he was afraid that the next day he would use a knife to force Wang Zhisong to write him a letter of divorce. Although he hadn\u2019t seen Wang Zhisong yet, he could already see that his family and him were not very good. Otherwise, when his family was in such a mess he would show up. In this era, 15 years old was old enough to be a father.Wang Shijing then spoke to his two children. \u201cFrom now on, you will call him little father.\u201dWang Qing and Wang Nizi immediately called in a disciplined manner. \u201cLittle father.\u201dWell, Shao Yunan was quite satisfied with this address, then the other Immediately continued. \u201cFrom now on, you can call me brother Shijing. Can I call you Yunan?\u201dThis body was ten years younger than Wang Shijing, so it was reasonable to call him brother. Shao Yunan\u2019s actual age was 26, the same as Wang Shijing, but he looked very \u2018fresh and tender\u2019 in comparison with Wang Shijing. Wang Shijing not only has some changes on his face due to age, but also some scattering of gray hair on both temples. In terms of experience, Wang Shijing also should be considered a tough one. Two years of forced labor, plus three years of military service, coupled with living in ancient times made him age prematurely. For example, old lady Wang was only in her forties, but looked like a person in her sixties. The average life expectancy of people here was only 50 or 60 years old and only the rich could live longer. In modern times, Wang Shijing\u2019s face definitely looked 35 or more.Faced with this old face, Shao Yunan did not feel awkward at all and just said, \u201cAlright, but I think that Xiao Ni\u2019s name should be changed. In the future, Ni\u2019s name is good for a small girl but she should also get a grown up one.\u201dWang Ni\u2019s eyes lit up brightly. Wang Shijing saw his daughter\u2019s thoughts and said, \u201cWe can name her Nizi, I don\u2019t know many words, but I learned it from others after I joined the army.\u201d Shao Yunan said. \u201cThen let me think about it.\u201dWang Ni lowered her head, her heart pounding. She was very afraid that her \u2018mother\u2019 would abuse her. Everyone in the village said so. Second aunt, sister-in-law, and cousin also said so, but now it seems that her little father wasn\u2019t so terrible.The four people quickly finished eating. Wang Shijing went out first to borrow a cart. It took less than half an hour to travel to the country town by ox cart. Shao Yunan dug up two pieces of cotton cloth from his dowry box. His dowry seems to be big, but in fact it was very little in value. None of the five boxes were full, there were only two bedding, two quilts, two pieces of cotton cloth, three pieces of coarse cloth, two lacquer boxes, and some loose items such as dishes and combs. As for the money at the bottom of the box, it was only one thousand copper coins, or 1 or 2 silver. The fact that the Shao family was willing to give Shao Yunan silver or two was already unexpected.Wang Shijing came back soon and Shao Yunan came out with two pieces of cotton cloth in his arms. \u201cAre there any clothes makers in the city? To make these into two clothes.\u201dWang Shijing said, \u201cIt\u2019s expensive to make clothes in the county town. Let\u2019s ask the aunt in the village to do it. It\u2019s cheaper and a good way to add some money to people\u2019s income.\u201dAlthough he had the memories of the original owner, Shao Yunan was still very unfamiliar with this world. Since Wang Shijing said so, he turned around and went back to put up the cloth.The village has ox carts and donkey carts that take people to the county town every day, which can also be regarded as a way to make a living. Wang Shijing didn\u2019t want to hitch a ride with other villagers, so he went to Wang Xing\u2019s house to borrow an ox cart. People in the village usually paid one coin for a one way ride and a person could travel both ways with two coins. Wang Shijing gave Wang Xing\u2019s family ten coins to rent a cart. Wang Xing\u2019s family refused to take it, but Wang Shijing still stuffed it in their hands.Wang Shijing drove the cart, while Shao Yunan sat in the \u2018open cart\u2019 protecting the two children with his right and left hands. The two children always gave the impression of being very formal and didn\u2019t have the innocence that children their age should have. It was not difficult for Shao Yunan to guess that the character of the two children was caused by their family environment, but he did not know what the two children have experienced to make them squeamish even in front of their own father.The ox cart was easy to ride in and the weather was also a bit cold, while the road was not very smooth. Shao Yunan vowed in his heart that he must buy a comfortable carriage in the future, otherwise a trip to the \u2018city\u2019 would simply kill him.After jolting for almost half an hour, they finally saw the gate of the county town. Shao Yunan could not help but feel some inside currents, his buttocks had already lost consciousness. For non-residents of the county, one penny per person was enough to enter the city, but children were not counted. Wang Shijing gave two pennies and rode the ox cart into the city. Once in the city, lively sounds come from all sides. Shao Yunan already had a mental imagination of the city, but even if it was not as dilapidated as he thought, it was not much better. From time to time, you could also see livestock coming in and out of the city, so the ground naturally was not very clean. The highest houses on both sides of the street were also only two stories high. There were also many vendors with stalls and shops open for business, with a variety of shop flags fluttering in the wind.Once in the city, Shao Yunan got down first, letting the two children sit in the cart while he followed Wang Shijing to the place where the livestock and carts were stored. The two children came to the city for the first time, left behind their timidity and restraint as they looked around at new and strange things. After Wang Shijing deposited the ox cart, Shao Yunan carried the red-faced Wang Nizi out of the cart, while Wang Qing jumped out of the cart by himself.Shao Yunan said: \u201cBrother Shijing, I want to stroll around the county town first, then we can eat here at noon. If you want to buy anything, you can buy it along the way.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to buy?\u201d Wang Shijing asked.Shao Yunan looked around and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know yet. I want to see the shops first.\u201d After thinking about it, he asked, \u201cHow\u2019s the security here?\u201d\u201cSecurity?\u201d\u201cIt is whether it is safe or not, whether there will be local hooligans and bullies or something.\u201dWang Shijing answered after a while. \u201cIt should not be too bad. Yongxiu County town is a big town, with many people coming from the south to the north. Now that the world is not so chaotic, there aren\u2019t too many bad people, so you just need to pay attention to some of them.\u201dIt was still good, so Shao Yunan immediately said, \u201cThen take care of Qing and Xiao Nizi while I go shopping. I will go around first and come back here. After I finish, if you come back first, wait for me here. If I finish shopping first, I will also wait for you to come back here.\u201dWang Shijing disagreed. \u201cI\u2019ll accompany you. What do you want to see? It\u2019s too late today, so I will come back with you tomorrow.\u201dShao Yunan said. \u201cNo need. I\u2019ll talk to you when I get back. It\u2019s settled. You and I will split up.\u201dShao Yunan was very persistent, so Wang Shijing did not force him. He took a purse out from his arms and was ready to give Shao Yunan some money, but Shao Yunan patted the cloth pocket in front of him and said: \u201cI have money on me, but I probably won\u2019t buy anything. If it\u2019s not enough, I\u2019ll come back and ask you.\u201dWang Shijing nodded and put away the money bag.\u201cI\u2019ll go buy food first.\u201d\u201cOkay, then I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\u201cAvoid people who are not good.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dWaving his hand to the three of them, Shao Yunan went first. Wang Shijing put on his back basket and looked at his back for a moment before looking down and saying to the two children: \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Then he bent down and picked up Wang Nizi, who hurriedly said: \u201cFather, I\u2019ll walk by myself.\u201d\u201cIf dad can\u2019t hold you anymore, then you can walk by yourself. Qing, you hold on to your father\u2019s clothes.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fierce \u201cHusband\u201dCH 6.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 6.1To earn money, you need to know the market first. Although the original body owner\u2019s memory could give him some reference, he still had to see it for himself. Shao Yunan has no way to compare if Yongxiu county town was big or not, but it was quite lively. This was also related to the geographical location of Yongxiu county town. After strolling through two streets, Shao Yunan saw a building with a special appearance and upon closer inspection, the plaque on the front door said \u2018Yongxiu Academy.\u2019 He knew what this place was, this should be the place where Wang Zhisong should be studying.The imperial examination system of Yan was divided into two types. Usually, all students who study in the official schools were child students. However, if you wanted to take the scholar examination ,you had to pass the official child student\u2019s examination. Only by passing the county examination and the government examination could you be considered an official boy student\u00a0\u00a0and be qualified to be a scholar. When you formally\u00a0apply for a scholar position, you should also have a guarantee (certificate) issued by the school you studied in. This kind of guarantee could be directly provided to you by the teacher who taught you. As long as you studied in the school, you could be considered a boy student. The teacher would give you this kind of guarantee, unless you were notorious.This path was mostly for students from poor families. If you were studying in the National Academy above the state level, you could skip the boy student\u2019s exam and directly take the scholar exam. If you studied in the capital\u2019s Imperial Academy, as long as you could graduate from the Academy, you were qualified to become a government official, with status equivalent to that of a scholar. You could also become an official directly or you could continue to take the examination. In addition, there was also another way. That was to be recommended by a highly respected Confucian scholar, which allowed you to sweep past the children\u2019s exam, and directly take the scholar exam. However, these two ways were difficult for the children of humble families. First of all, no matter if it was the National Academy or the recommendation of a great scholar, such a person must be extremely excellent. It was difficult to get in and out of the country\u2019s official schools and the level of education that such people have received since childhood was definitely not comparable to that of the children of the poor who come from villages. As for the recommendation of respected Confucian scholars, how many humble families could have access to such prominent figures?The imperial examination in the State of Yan could also be regarded as a stage in the transition from a well-established family recommendation system to a complete imperial examination system. The roles of the State Scholar\u2019s Office and the great scholars were similar to that of the former family. The school affiliated with the imperial court offered the possibility of entering civil service for the sons of humble families.In the State of Yan, studying was a sacred thing and the status of a scholar was quite high. It was even more extraordinary if one had fame and merit. In the State of Yan, the division of the latter two was not so clear, but the status of merchants in the State of Yan was also not so bad. There was no emphasis on agriculture over business, but scholars were still considered absolutely superior.Whether it was the previous dynasty or the current dynasty, the selection of imperial examinations\u00a0was extremely strict, even students who come from the State Scholars Academy needed to enter the examination to become a scholar and the students who really were able to enter the road of officialdom were rare. The imperial examination was held every three years, but the number of\u00a0 students who were able to become scholars was only a few people. More often than not, it was only a dozen to twenty people and more than half of them were selected from the talents recommended by the State Scholarship and the great scholars.Only two scholars have been produced in Xiushui Village in the past hundred years. One of them belonged to the Zhao Family and another from the Wang family. It was thanks to these two scholars that the Zhao and Wang families were able to become the big families of Xiushui Village, which was originally dominated by the Sun family. For the children of a poor family, it was already an honor to pass the child student examination. Both the child student examination and the scholar examination were held twice a year, but they were staggered. You have to qualify for the child student exam before you could take part in the next years scholar exam and obtain scholar exam before you could take part in the official exam that was held once every three years. Wang Zhisong passed the child student examination at the age of 15, which could be called a prodigy among many students who were still taking the child student examination at the age of thirty.The child student examination was held every other year on August 12 and there are two consecutive exams in the respective districts, states, and prefectures. Those who obtained the boy student exam qualification could take part in the scholar examination in August of the following year. Those who passed the examination will be named [scholars] and then they will be able to take part in the triennial autumn examination \u2013 the township examination \u2013 and those who pass will be [Juren]. Then, in the spring exam held in April of the following year, the one who passed will be [Gong Sheng]. The gong sheng will take part in palace examination and the emperor or the person appointed by the emperor would conduct the final assessment and select the top three [Jinshi]. For every student, becoming a Jinshi was the ultimate goal they strived for and the position of one of the three top scholars, the first Scholar, the Top Scholar or the second scholar was their ultimate goal.But even so, even if it was just the position of [scholar] it was already a great honor. Not only could you be exempted from the taxes for thirty mu of land, \\ you could have a monthly salary of two taels of silver and a certain amount of food each month. Rich families despise this, but for students from poor families, it was different.Wang Zhisong passed the child student examination this year and next August he will be able to take the examination. But since he was only 15 years old, not to mention the Wang family, the entire Wang clan and Xiushui Village were looking forward to Wang Zhisong\u2019s future. They hoped that he could become another scholar in a hundred years and might even become the first master in the history of Xiushui Village. He may even become the first Juren from Xiushui Village or go even further and become [Gong Sheng] or even Jinshi!In this regard, Shao Yunan pouted in his heart. It was not that he looked down on these poor students, but with Wang Zhisong\u2019s character and Wang family\u2019s superb family education, it may be possible for him to become scholar, but he didn\u2019t think he would be able to go much further. With such a strict imperial examination system, everyone prepared for the exam. As long as someone was willing to reveal the affairs of the Wang family, Wang Zhisong\u2019s disrespect for his elder brother alone would be enough for him to drink a pot.Because it was difficult to become an official, they attached great importance to the reputation and character of students, and the selection officials of the imperial court also avoided the selection of people with poor character to avoid harming the emperor\u2019s land. From this, it could also be seen that Wang Zhisong and the Wang family, including the whole Wang clan, become short-sighted, thinking that family matters may become a disaster that will affect Wang Zhisong\u2019s career in the future.If the Wang family and Wang Zhisong honestly didn\u2019t mess with them in the future, Shao Yunan wouldn\u2019t care how far Wang Zhisong would go in the exam, but if the Wang family wasn\u2019t smart, he didn\u2019t mind being the one who stabbed them in the back.From the imperial examination system of the State of Yan, he could see the level of social development of the State of Yan was not too backward and primitive. But paradoxically, the productivity and economic standard of Yan was really underdeveloped. The Ming and Qing dynasties were the period when the imperial examination system was developed and perfected, but the productivity and economic standard of Yan was far inferior to that of the Ming dynasty or even to that of Tang dynasty, let alone the richest Song dynasty. Great Yan\u2019s grain production was not high. Rice, corn, millet, wheat, beans etc. were all planted, but ordinary people could mainly eat only mixed grain at home. There were also not many kinds of vegetables, that was potatoes, cabbage, white radish, winter sunflower, soybean seedlings, leeks, spinach, eggplant, and several kinds of wild vegetables. Cucumbers, tomatoes and so on were not available.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In his later years, the late emperor\u2019s head was foggy, causing a lot of troubles which affected the stability of Yan. Then the emperor finally died and the prince ascended the throne. The new emperor was considered a wise ruler and he was trying to change the country, so some improvement could finally be seen. However, in his later years, the late emperor made a lot of construction projects and many of them were not finished even until his death. It was a pity to give up on these projects so they continued, but needed money. Some of these projects were also useful for people\u2019s livelihood and the development of the country, so the new emperor gritted his teeth and set aside a sum of silver from the treasury. He took money from his own private treasury and then collected donations from other people around. He also stopped completely unnecessary projects, but insisted on the completion of the rest, which was why Wang Shijing\u2019s service lasted for two years.The project was not completed and foreign enemies were ready to make a move, while there were many large and small natural disasters every year. Even if the new emperor knew fully well that it may\u00a0 cause discontent among the people and unrest in the country, he could only increase taxes again. Those big projects needed money, war needed money, and disaster relief also needed money. Maintaining the operation of the country also needed money. Shao Yunan could imagine how worried the late emperor\u2019s son was.Because of the increase in taxes, prices were higher than before, so many farmers couldn\u2019t afford to pay taxes and had to sell their land cheaply or leave their homes. The location of Yongxiu region was relatively good and could be considered a major transportation route between the north and the south. Plus the land was fertile, so the population was also large and was considered a relatively rich place. Xiushui Village was not far from the Yongxiu region. Relying on mountains and rivers, it was a rich village under the jurisdiction of the Yongxiu region, so relatively speaking, everyone\u2019s life was not so difficult. If it was the borders or one of the places hit by disasters in successive years, 9 out of 10 homes would be empty and everyone would be displaced. The Wang family has twenty-seven mu of land and in Xiushui Village was considered an upper middle class family. Originally considered a large family, they sold a lot of land because of Wang Zhisong\u2019s medical treatment.The geographical location of the Yongxiu Region determined that the average farmer\u2019s land was not too small. Shao Yunan did not know how much old lady Wang\u2019s family earned a year. The Shao family had twenty-eight mu of land, plus old man Shao and Shao Dahu would go to work as part-time workers, so they had an income of 20 to 30 taels a year, if they were diligent. But now taxes were heavy and the year was difficult, so after the deduction of land tax, poll tax, and other exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes, they needed to pay more than a dozen taels of land tax every year. After deducting what they spent on eating, drinking, and clothes, the final balance was only two of three taels of silver. If you pay the tax, conscription tax, etc., then you would have to borrow money. This was the situation all around the Yongxiu region, including Chi Nan Prefecture, which could be regarded as the relatively rich state capital of Great Yan. If it was a poorer place, they wouldn\u2019t know how they would endure the day and no one knew how many people would have to leave their homes and become refugees.On the one hand, it was related to the unstable situation at home and abroad. but on the other and more important one, Great Yan\u2019s commerce was not developed enough. Most of the court\u2019s taxes were collected from the peasants and resulted in the peasants\u2019 life getting harder and harder, while court taxes became harder and harder to collect, as the country got poorer and poorer.Shao Yunan remembered that 70% of the Song Dynasty\u2019s revenue was from commerce and agriculture only accounted for 30%, so the people in the Song Dynasty were very rich. However, no matter how underdeveloped a dynasty was, there were still many rich people. Shao Yunan thought about how to make money in the future as he walked, when he suddenly got an idea when he saw two people. He bought five large meat buns at the bun stall on the street and clenched four coins in his hands as he walked towards those two people.Two beggars standing at the bottom of the wall waiting for handouts from passers-by. A teenager dressed in ordinary clothes came up to them and smiled as he put a paper bag smelling of meat in front of them, making the two beggars rush to say thank you to him.\u201cThank you, thank you.\u201dShao Yunan did not mind their dirty smell and as the two beggars\u2019 black hands grabbed the buns to eat, he said, \u201cTwo big brothers, I have something I want to inquire about.\u201dA beggar swallowed the meat bun and nodded. \u201cJust ask, little brother.\u201dAnother beggar also nodded fiercely. They had met many people who gave them alms but it was the first time someone was willing to smile at them. There was also no dislike or disgust in the eyes of the young boy and the young boy was also very handsome.Shao Yunan was very happy as he spoke. \u201cI came to the county town for the first time and want to understand the situation of the town. Tell me what you know. The more detailed the better.\u201d After saying that, he put down the four coins he clutched in his hand. \u201cThis is a thank you fee.\u201dThank you fee?These words sounded new, but the two beggars were shaking their heads. \u201dNo, no, you have already bought us buns, how can we still ask you for money?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s not much. Maybe in the future Yuan might have to trouble two the big brothers to help me find out some news.\u201dThe two beggars looked at each other and did not refuse. They immediately told Shao Yunan everything they knew about the Yongxiu region, since there were steamed buns to eat and money to earn. Shao Yunan, who sat casually to one side, attracted the attention of passers-by. Such a clean young man was also a beggar?The two beggars told everything they knew and Shao Yunan asked a few more questions to get a clearer understanding of the Yongxiu region. This understanding also gave him a more intuitive understanding of the world.After getting the information he wanted to know, Shao Yunan bought some more meat buns for the two people before he left. As he walked away, he\u00a0 did not notice that the two beggars were watching him until he disappeared into the crowd. One beggar put away the four coins, while another beggar helped him to stand up.\u201cBig Brother, that little brother is a good man.\u201d\u201cWell. I hope all good people will be rewarded.\u201dThere were two jewelry shops in Yongxiu County, one was run by locals while the other was run by businessmen from another place. There were a lot of people coming from both north and south in the Yongxiu region, so there were all kinds of shops. Of course, in Shao Yunan\u2019s eyes, they were still lagging behind. According to the instructions of the two beggars, Shao Yunan found one of the jewelry shops, the \u2018Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion,\u2019 which was opened by a businessman from outside.As soon as he walked into the store, he was immediately greeted by a clerk. \u201cPlease come inside. What do you want to see?\u201dThe clerk did not drive Shao Yunan away just because of his simple clothes and greeted him with a gracious smile. Shao Yunan also smiled as he said, \u201cLet me have a look first.\u201dThe clerk\u2019s smile remained the same as he said, \u201cPlease.\u201dShao Yunan followed the clerk to the shelves. There was no glass here, so there were no cabinets and all the goods were on the shelves. Not only were there clerks in the store, but also two big men in the courtyard that looked like they came from out of town. Shao Yunan first went to one side to see the silver and gold jewelry, then he went to the second side to see the jades.At this time, gold, silver, and jade were all handmade and looked much more delicate and beautiful than the mass-produced jewelry found in modern society. Shao Yunan secretly thought that when he had money in the future he had to buy some beautiful jewelry and exquisite antiques. After looking around, Shao Yunan said to the clerk, \u201cI have a set of jade pendants that I want to show to your shopkeeper.\u201dThe clerk was stunned at first, but then said, \u201cSir, if you want to pawn them, there is a pawn shop on that street just past the left turn at the crossing of the road.\u201dShao Yunan said, \u201cI\u2019m not here to pawn silver, I\u2019m here to show your shopkeeper a novelty.\u201d\u201cTo see the novelty?\u201d The clerk did not understand.Shao Yunan smiled, \u201cI have this set of jade which can\u2019t be bought anywhere and it\u2019s very unique.\u201dThe clerk hesitated when suddenly a voice came from the staircase on the second floor. \u201cUnique jade? Please lead the guest upstairs.\u201dShao Yunan looked up as the clerk who also looked up immediately said. \u201cThis is our family\u2019s boss.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Saying thank you to the clerk, Shao Yunan walked over while the person upstairs clasped his fist. \u201cMy surname is Zeng, but I don\u2019t know the guest\u2019s surname.\u201d\u201cMy surname is Shao. Thank you, shopkeeper Zeng, for giving me a chance.\u201d\u201cSir Shao, please.\u201dShao Yunan followed shopkeeper Zeng upstairs.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He seemed to own several stores starting from jewelry, cloth, catering and so on. Yizhang Xuan, the largest restaurant in the Yongxiu region was also owned by this man, but this was not the reason why Shao Yunan chose the\u00a0 Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion. It was also said that the big boss was a kind man. During the New Year\u2019s holidays or disaster years, Yizhang Xuan restaurants would distribute porridge and they also built an important bridge in the Yongxiu. So in short, the big boss not only knew how to do business, but also looked like a good character.If you wanted to do business, you had to choose the right partner. Shao Yunan had no authority and no power.The modern world business was all about relationships, let alone the ancient times where human rights were not protected in the slightest. To put it bluntly, Shao Yunan just wanted to find a suitable thigh to hug. The big boss from the capital had thicker thighs than a local boss. He couldn\u2019t say what kind of relationship he would have in the future with the big boss, but as long as he cooperated with him, it would give him more than a few points of protection. Of course, he will not blindly hang himself on the tree.Boss Zeng politely took Shao Yunan to the second floor. There were also several shelves on the second floor, but no matter the color of the jade or the delicacy of the gold and silver jewelry, they were all one or two grades higher than those on the first floor. Shao Yunan just glanced at them before following the shopkeeper into a room, which should be boss Zeng\u2019s office.\u201cPlease sit down.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dShao Yunan sat with Boss Zeng across a tea table. Not long after, the shop clerk came with tea. Shao Yunan was really a little thirsty, so after saying a greeting, he picked up the celadon teacup, plucked the tea lid twice and took a sip. The tea here was all decoction tea which was rarely drunk in modern society. Few people drank it, but Shao Yunan was incapable of accepting it.After moistening his lips and throat, Shao Yunan put down the teacup and pulled out a black velvet bag from the cloth pocket in front of his chest. Boss Zeng looked twice at the \u2018velvet\u2019 bag in his hand and immediately directed Shao Yunan to another long table. Shao Yunan got up and went over to the table, then shopkeeper Zeng took out a piece of wool skin. Shao Yunan emptied the contents of the velvet bag and spread it on the white woolen leather, while the eyes of boss Zheng changed.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dShao Yunan did not answer immediately as he took out the three jade pendants in the velvet bag and placed them on the table before saying, \u201cEmerald four seasons jade pendant. Four have the meaning of four seasons of peace; three for winning fortune, prosperity, and longevity; and two symbolize love between mother and child. This jadeite is harder than ordinary jade and also has a peculiar color.\u201d\u201cThis set of pendants was my husband\u2019s strange encounter and if it wasn\u2019t for an urgent need for money, I would not take it out.\u201d Looking at the set of rare jadeite jade, with its rare shape, how much money would they be worth? How many students wished they could win one of the top three scholar positions and how many women wished to have a son? These two items alone were enough to attract a lot of business opportunities.It was only during the Qing Dynasty that jadeite entered the country from Burma. But in this world there was still no jadeite in the great country of Yan and only locally produced nephrite. It\u2019s color could be mainly white, blue, green, and yellow, with rare black and purple.\u00a0 The country of Great Yan also did not yet have vegetables such as beans, so it\u2019s shape could still be called strange.Shao Yunan has his space in hand and now he has money. His favorite thing at ordinary times beside eating, drinking, and playing was storing goods and materials in his space. There were a lot of gold, silver and jade articles stored in Shao Yunan\u2019s space\u00a0and he usually put all the valuables he got in it. For a while, he was poisoned by doomsday novels\u00a0so he collected all sorts of supplies. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he transmigrated to the ancient times, his collection in the space and things in it would allow him to live here in style for two lifetimes.He had the jadeite four seasons pendant in three colors, white, violet and another color. All of them were bought on the Burma jade market where there were many kinds of jade. The spirit stone tonic in the space also has the effect of improving the quality of ordinary jade, so even ordinary jades could turn into top quality jade after absorbing the spirit stone tonic for a period of time.The reason why Shao Yunan took out a set of jade pendants was because they were not available in this world and because this set of pendants was the cheapest one from his jades. As for his future plans, he would still take a special set of jadeite jade that was not available here to offer. As for the gold and silver, Shao Yunan had collected before. They were all gold and silver bars engraved with \u2018XX Bank\u2019 and simply could not be taken out.Boss Zheng carefully checked them one by one and took a white jade handle to test the sound. He also compared it against the light outside the window to see the color. After half an hour, boss Zheng put down the pendant and looked at Shao Yunan with burning eyes. \u201cDoes master Shao still have such jadeite jade?\u201dShao Yunan smiled bitterly. \u201cMy husband and I are both from farming families. If my husband hadn\u2019t had a strange encounter when he was in the army, we wouldn\u2019t have this.\u201d Boss Zeng\u2019s eyes were filled with pity as he held out his five fingers. \u201cFive hundred taels. I\u2019ll buy this set of pendants and the style of these four seasons.\u201d Shao Yunan felt ecstatic as he said sincerely, \u201cSince the shopkeeper is so sincere, I won\u2019t haggle. I will take this five hundred taels. It\u2019s a deal.\u201dBoss Zeng did not expect the other side to act so decisively and showed some hesitation. \u201cIt\u2019s surely clean, right?\u201d Shao Yunan nodded. \u201cOf course. Even if I wanted to steal, I don\u2019t have a place to steal from. Boss Zeng certainly knows the market more than me.\u201dThis was the main point. Boss Zeng really believed in his eyesight. This kind of jade really had not been seen in Yan. It was because he had never seen anything like this, that he offered such a high price. Five hundred taels of silver was a large amount, even for boss Zeng and it was even more astronomical for ordinary people.The reason why boss Zeng opened his mouth and gave a high price of 500 teals was because of a hunch that this young man who claimed to be a \u2018farmer\u2019s son\u2019 was certainly not a simple person. His words and actions were unlike any son from a farmer\u2019s family. With this first transaction, boss Zeng wanted to show his intention of friendship.\u201cI need to write a deed. You can\u2019t reveal this style to others.\u201d\u201cNo problem. However, if it is spread from the Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion, I can\u2019t be held responsible.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dOnce the shopkeeper got up and went to find someone to write the deed, Shao Yunan rubbed his face vigorously. Unexpectedly, 500 taels! It was worth 500taels! He bought this pendant for two thousand yuan! 500 taels was definitely worth a lot of money. He thought it would be good enough if it sold for 100 taels. The ecstatic Shao Yunan, of course did not think much of selling this rare item that he wouldn\u2019t be able to buy, even if he had 500 taels of silver in the future. Not to mention how much money would be earned in the name of the imperial examinations and births, after four seasons pendants were launched by the Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion.The four seasons pendant style model was simple, but since the Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion had some family background, even if other families followed the trend, Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion would still earn a lot of money. In fact, it would be Shao Yunan who suffered a loss, but he did not care about it at all.In the time it took to brew a cup of tea, boss Zeng came back with two deeds in his hand. Shao Yunan read through them and finding nothing wrong, signed them. Great State of Yan characters were mainly simply traditional Chinese characters, many of which Shao Yunan could read, but not write. The ones he didn\u2019t know he had to guess, but most of the characters he could read very easily.Shao Yunan\u2019s mother came from a scholarly family and his grandfather researched the tea ceremony. Shao Yunan was also nurtured since childhood and when he gained the space, he planted some tea, fruits, vegetables, and grain in it. When he was at school, he started a tea business and then when he went abroad, he became infatuated with wine and started a wine business with his friends. Therefore, Shao Yunan liked tasting tea and wine, and the taste of things produced in his space was naturally incomparable to anything else, gaining him a bunch of foodie friends.When tasting tea, the piano, chess, calligraphy, and painting was an essential part of the deal, so over time Shao Yunan was also inculcated with certain pretentious characteristics, brush writing being one of them. Looking at Shao Yunan\u2019s writing, boss Zeng became even more sure of his suspicions. Having been in business for decades, boss Zeng developed his own eyesight.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you go to these stores in the future, just take out this jade token and you will get the most affordable price.\u201dShao Yunan really did not expect such a good thing, it was no wonder that this big boss could make his business so big. Just looking at his people, they were too good! Shao Yunan clasped his fist to thank him. \u201cThank you, master Zeng for the gift.\u201d Boss Zeng smoothly said, \u201cIn the future, if Master Shao has other rare items you want to sell, please do not hesitate to come to the Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dShao Yunan awkwardly accepted ten, fifty taels silver ingots after some more courtesy. At this time, the circulation of silver notes was not yet widespread, so only big merchants would use silver tickets for the convenience of trading goods. It was also very troublesome to exchange silver notes, so Shao Yunan asked to exchange one fifty taels of silver ingot into one tael loose silver ingots and three taels of silver into copper coins.Boss Zeng was kind enough to give him a cloth pouch, so Shao Yunan put fifteen taels of silver into his sleeves and left the Butterfly Pavilion with the heavy cloth pouch in his arms. As soon as he left, the shopkeeper called for a reliable subordinate and wrote a letter, asking the subordinate to take the letter and the three four-season pendants in a wooden box to the capital.\u203bWith money in hand, he no longer felt panic in his heart.\u00a0 Shao Yunan, who left the Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion, bought a back basket on the street and put the cloth pocket in it. The back basket was deep and through this action, he put the cloth pocket into his space. He then went back to Wang Shijing with the basket on his back. Passing by the bookstore along the way, he went in and came out with a bag of books and three sets of pen and ink in the basket.In this way, Shao Yunan bought whatever he wanted to buy on the way. He bought refreshments and a pile of seasonings in the grocery store, as well as a few kinds of food. The Great State of Yan only has a few kinds of food, but the spices were quite abundant. The location of the Yongxiu region also determined that the goods here were relatively complete.Shao Yunan bought pepper, star anise, chili pepper, soy sauce, vinegar, salt and other common seasonings. After asking the owner of the grocery store, he went to the pharmacy to buy cinnamon, orange peel, fennel, and anything else he could think of that was available here and could be used as a seasoning. The Great State of Yan was now able to use soybeans to squeeze soybean oil, but it was quite expensive.Since Shao Yunan had money now, he bought a lot of it. He was also surprised to find that there were people who sold sugar here, but it was very expensive and could not be called cane sugar. Rather, stone sugar was sold in large blocks. 0,5 kg of rock sugar cost 500 copper coins, so Shao Yunan bought 2 kg of stone sugar and 1,5 kg of maltose. Maltose was very cheap and only cost 30 copper coins for 0,5kg. But it only looked cheap to Shao Yunan, a sugar that was not a necessity would not be bought by the average person.He bought and bought all the way, especially when he passed near the meat stall. He made the butcher think he wanted to open a restaurant because he bought so many ribs, tube bones, pork, hind leg meat, etc. Shao Yunan also bought fifteen apples and pears, but was unable to carry them. These things costed five taels of silver. Things like soybean oil, meat, fruit and stone sugar were really expensive\u2026 it\u2019s simply too extravagant here!Farmers grew food in order to survive, so few of them would grow fruit trees. So the fruit they ate\u00a0 were mostly wild ones they found on the mountain. Only large families and rich officials would hire people to grow fruit in their fields, but it was only to supply their own consumption so not many fruits were sold. The prices were also expensive. One apple was sold for ten coins and a pear for 12. If it was some rarer fruit like peach, orange, etc., it would be even more expensive. Peaches like any wild peach were sour and oranges were also sour, so Shao Yunan didn\u2019t buy them. Shao Yunan also couldn\u2019t find anyone who sold grapes. There were only a few people outside selling it, so Shao Yunan could only comfort himself that at least he could take it out openly in the future.He has a lot of good grape and tea seeds in his space and because of the space, he could grow quality vines and tea trees as long as he had the seeds. In addition, because he had been stimulated by doomsday novels, he had frantically purchased various kinds of food, vegetables, fruits, flowers and plants seeds. With seeds, land, and space, it\u2019s not hard to grow them. The hard part was taking them out. He could take out a set of four seasons jade pendant, explaining it as Wang Shijing\u2019s strange encounter, but he could not say that everything was a strange encounter.Tea and grapes were available here so he could always say to the public that he found a new variety and improved them when he took out the grapes and tea from the space. Shao Yunan\u2019s ultimate idea was to rely on wine and tea to make money. This was what he was most familiar with in his line of work. Therefore, the act of taking the jade out to sell would not be repeated in the future, unless Great Yan also had jade. It was a kind of sour feeling to hold on to a gold mountain that couldn\u2019t be used.The original body owner looked good, not the handsome or dashing kind in modern society that was considered the fresh meat type. With fair skin and a thin body, how could he look like someone who orgined from a farming family? But the original body owner was really a good farmer and had a lot of strength. The original body owner had become one with Shao Yunan\u2019s memory. Memories were always memories, so Shao Yunan knew he could really do a lot of things and work hard. Fortunately, the original owner had some strength, otherwise he really wouldn\u2019t have been able to carry the things he bought to the place where he and Wang Shijing agreed to meet.The place where the livestock was deposited was relatively crowded and chaotic, and Shao Yunan was sweating as he walked with a bamboo basket on his back and a large jar of soybean oil in his arms.\u201cYunan.\u201d Shao Yunan looked up\u00a0 at the sound and immediately acted like he had seen a savior. \u201dCome and help.\u201dWang Shijing, who had come back a long time ago, quickly walked over and first took over the large jar of soybean oil in Shao Yunan\u2019s arms, then he helped him unload the basket with the other hand. Seeing that the basket was full of things, he asked, \u201cWhy did you buy so much?\u201d But he was even more interested in asking where the money came from.\u201cWell, I\u2019ve bought a lot of things. I\u2019ll talk to you when we get back. I\u2019m exhausted. Have you bought your things yet?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all bought.\u201d\u201cThen\u00a0let\u2019s eat dinner, I am hungry. I still want to go to the cloth shop after we finish.\u201d\u201c\u2026 alright.\u201dWang Shijing easily picked up the back basket, holding the large jar of soybean oil in one hand and Shao Yunan\u2019s arm with the other. \u201cPut the things in the cart first. No one will steal them with so many people around. Watch your step.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d Shao Yunan was tired and hungry. Wang Shijing took Shao Yunan to the storage office, where Shao Yunan saw Wang Qing and Wang Ni standing by the cart looking up. Seeing him, the two children shouted in unison, \u201cLittle father.\u201d\u201cYou\u00a0must have been anxious waiting. Little father has bought you some delicious food and will prepare it for you when we get home.\u201d The two children\u2019s little faces instantly lit up with eagerness. Shao Yunan smiled. \u201cGo eat first. Little daddy will take you guys for a big meal.\u201d\u201cYunan.\u201d Wang Shijing called. Shao Yunan knew what he was thinking and said boldly, \u201cI\u2019m not short of money now. Let\u2019s go to Yizhang Xuan for dinner!\u201d Wang Shijing and his two children were full of doubt. Wang Shijing meant that he could just eat a bowl of noodles or wonton on the street, but he couldn\u2019t stop Shao Yunan, who dragged them to the Yizhang Xuan restaurant for dinner.Sitting at the table in the restaurant, Wang Qing and Wang Nizi were still a little confused. Not to mention eating out here, the two children had never had a chance to eat out since they were born. They have never even eaten steamed stuffed buns from outside, but now they were sitting in such a magnificent and luxurious restaurant. The two children dressed in patched clothes didn\u2019t know where to put their hands.The waiter of Yizhang Xuan, like the clerk in the Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion did not show any expression of disgust because of the clothes of the four people, nor did they prevent them from entering the door. As long as a person came in, they were guests. If the other person really tried to scam a meal from them, they had their own way of dealing with it.Because many people could not read and write, there was no such thing as a menu in the restaurant, so the waiters explained the dishes in the restaurant. Shao Yunan refused to wait for the waiter to name the dishes one by one and without knowing what kind of food they served he ordered three meat dishes, three vegetarian dishes, a pot of good tea, a pot of good wine, and two of the most famous refreshments in the store.Wang Qing and Wang Nizi listened to their heart thumping, while Wang Shijing was stopped with a look several times when he wanted to speak to Shao Yunan. After the waiter brought the tea, Shao Yunan poured tea for Wang Shijing and the two children saying, \u201cBrother Shijing you can eat without worry. I stayed and I am a part of the family. You want to support the family and I am the same. I have a way to earn money and I have already earned some money, so our life will get better and better in the future.\u201dWang Shijing opened his mouth and finally said, \u201cOkay. You have your own ideas, so I won\u2019t ask any more questions. If you need to talk, don\u2019t be polite.\u00a0 We are family.\u201dWang Qing and Wang Nizi stared at Shao Yunan, who was smiling. \u201cWell, we\u2019re family \u2018now\u2019.\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s mouth clenched.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When the first plate of stew was served, Wang Qing and Wang Nizi began to drool. Shao Yunan asked for rice and a pancake, depending on what the two children liked to eat. Wang Qing and Wang Nizi were very restrained and didn\u2019t dare to move their chopsticks, so Shao Yunan said, \u201cWe won\u2019t go home until you\u2019ve finished eating. Let\u2019s start!\u201dThe two children did not understand the meaning of \u2018start,\u2019 but after Shao Yunan put the food into their bowls and they got Wang Shijing\u2019s approval, the two children picked up their chopsticks and picked up the meat. After the first mouthful of meat, the two children couldn\u2019t hold on anymore. Shao Yunan beckoned Wang Shijing to eat, as he himself tried each dish and ate in big bites.The taste of the dishes here could only be considered very general for Shao Yunan, but the original taste also had a different kind of flavor, as the ingredients here were absolutely natural and pollution-free. The price of oil was high, so in order to control costs, unless it was a specific guest, the restaurant would use lard to stir-fry dishes. Some dishes were stir-fried with lard, but some still required vegetable oil.Anyway, Shao Yunan was hungry, so everything tasted good. The four people did not speak as they ate with their heads buried, many of the guests who came to the restaurant glanced at them, suspicious that \u2018these four people came to steal a meal.\u2019 Wang Qing and Wang Nizi have never eaten such a delicious meal, not even at New Years, so their faces were stained with oil. Shao Yunan finally had to say, \u201cDon\u2019t eat too much. You can eat this kind of food every day.\u201d\u201cDaddy, really?\u201d After the meal, Wang Nizi dropped the formality and took the initiative to speak for the first time. Shao Yunan nodded. \u201cLittle daddy promises you that you will have meat every day in the future. So eat a little less meat now, so you won\u2019t have to take medicine.\u201d It\u2019s not like they couldn\u2019t eat meat at all.When Wang Nizi heard that, she hurriedly put down her chopsticks. Wang Qing also put down his chopsticks and burped. Shao Yunan also had enough to eat, so he just asked Wang Shijing, \u201cCan you wrap up the rest?\u201d Wang Shijing nodded and put the rest of the dishes into a bowl one by one. When he couldn\u2019t eat any more dim sum, Shao Yunan asked the waiter to pack it and then asked him to settle the bill.The waiter packed the dim sum and came over to settle the bill. The total was one tael of silver and three coins, which was not too expensive for Shao Yunan. Wang Shijing wanted to take out money from his pocket, but Shao Yunan pressed his hand and took out two taels of silver to give to the waiter. \u201cChange the rest of the silver for drinks.\u201dWang Shijing looked down at Shao Yunan\u2019s hand a few times and only after Shao Yunan withdrew his hand, he put it down.The waiter also didn\u2019t expect Shao Yunan to be able to check out so readily, because he really didn\u2019t look like a rich person and it was already a luxury for ordinary people to come to the restaurant and eat a bowl of noodles. Shao Yunan had ordered wine. Even when not so good, wine was considered a luxury. Wang Shijing also did not act greedy and only drank a small cup. Then Shao Yunan thought that even though he bought so many things, he seemed not to have bought anything for Wang Shijing, so he simply bought some wine. The wine here had a low alcohol content and taste, so Shao Yunan didn\u2019t like it.When Wang Shijing finished eating and the wine was packed, the four of them left Yizhang Xuan in a courteous send-off by the waiters. Shao Yunan did not use the jade plaque given by Boss Zeng. For one thing, the price was not so expensive and two, he did not want to give the other party an impression of being too cheap. He had money now. It was also not too late to take out that jade token when they got acquainted in the future.After eating a big meal, Wang Qing and Wang Nizi obviously calmed down a lot. Then Wang Shijing took Shao Yunan and the two children to the cloth shop. Shao Yunan bought two pairs of shoes for himself, Wang Shijing and the two children, and three sets of good cotton clothes. He wanted to make two more quilts and mattresses, but of course he would need to ask the shop to make them first. These things cost another four taels of silver. In Wang Shijing\u2019s opinion, Shao Yunan was spending money like water, but he did not say a word. It was up to Shao Yunan to make his own decisions.When Wang Shijing was driving them back, Shao Yunan still sat in the cart protecting the two children and Wang Nizi quietly grabbed Shao Yunan\u2019s sleeve. Shao Yunan yawned a few times and said, \u201cBrother Shijing, don\u2019t hurry up to unpack. I want to take a nap first.\u201d His body\u2019s physical foundation was not good, but after a series of things happened and he ate till his stomach was full, his spirit became a little weak.Wang Shijing seriously drove the ox cart and said, \u201cGo back to bed. I will clean it up.\u201d\u201cDaddy, I can clean up too.\u201d Wang Qing said boldly. Shao Yunan touched Wang Qing\u2019s head and was not polite. \u201cGood, you two can help your father clean up if you are not sleepy.\u201d Wang Qing and Wang Nzii showed the first faint shy smile on their faces.\u203bHalfway up the road, Shao Yunan was already drowsy. Afraid that he would catch a cold, Wang Shijing had to shout to wake him up several times. When he finally saw the village in the distance, Shao Yunan couldn\u2019t hold back his sleep anymore. When Wang Shijing returned with the ox cart, all the villagers paid attention to them. The Wang family had attracted a lot of attention these days,and Shao Yunan, who dared to cut people with an axe within two days of getting married, attracted more attention.Seeing so many things on the ox cart, a woman immediately shouted sourly, \u201cShijing, you bought so many things.\u201dWang Shijing replied with just a faint \u201cum.\u201d Along the way, he met several more women who inquired about it, but Wang Shijing just responded with a \u201chmm.\u201dIt was hard to have privacy in the village. Wang Shijing had bought so many things. Two bamboo baskets were full of things, not to mention the five cloths placed in the cart. Although they were wrapped and they couldn\u2019t see what kind of cloth they were, buying five sets of clothes at a time outside the village was simply unthinkable. The cart was filled with food, sundries, and a square wooden table. Many people remembered that Shao Yunan broke the square table in the courtyard of the Lizheng family, so this table must be compensation for the Lizheng family. These things must have cost several taels of silver.The discussion followed Wang Shijing all the way and Wang Qing and Wang Nizi, who were concerned about it, shrank up very uncomfortably. Wang Nizi was shrinking into Shao Yunan\u2019s arms. While dazed, Shao Yunan subconsciously hugged Wang Nizi as he yawned loudly.\u201cAre we there yet?\u201dThe drowsiness in the soft voice made Wang Shijing\u2019s hand holding the whip tighten. Ignoring the attention around him, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be home soon.\u201dShao Yunan reluctantly opened his eyes and indeed saw the dilapidated house he was currently living in. Wang Shijing just parked the cart on the side, while Shao Yunan couldn\u2019t wait to climb down.\u201cYunan, just go to bed.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I am going to sleep. I am too sleepy.\u201d A yawning Shao Yunan followed Wang Shijing closely and waited for him to unlock the door.When he returned to the house, Shao Yunan kicked off his shoes and didn\u2019t even bother to wash his hands as he took off his outer clothes and socks, before pulling back the quilt and going in. Wang Shijing watched him fall asleep before he went out and closed the door. Wang Qing and Wang Nizi were still in the cart, afraid that other people would take the things in the cart. As Wang Shijing unloaded the things from the cart into the courtyard and asked the two children to take out the things in the two big bamboo baskets first, he returned to the cart to take the table over to the Lizheng family.Wang Qing and Wang Nizi did not dare to touch their little father\u2019s bamboo basket, so they first took out all the things from the other bamboo basket. Wang Qing took the heavy things like pots and pans to the kitchen, while Wang Nizi took in the seasonings. When Wang Shijing came back, there were still a lot of things in the yard, although the two children moved all the things they could into the kitchen. Wang Shijing took the cloth, cotton, new shoes, and so on, into his and Shao Yunan\u2019s room quietly. Shao Yunan was still sleeping deeply, not moving at all.Wang Qing and Wang Nizi stood next to the bamboo basket, their expression curious about what their little father had bought. Wang Shijing walked over and bent down to pick up two wrapped paper bags at the top of the bamboo basket. Putting it on the ground, Wang Shijing asked Wang Qing to get a firewood knife. He cut the packing rope and opened the thick paper bag making Wang Qing and Wang Nizi exclaim.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was books, paper, and brushes! Countless times he envied his cousin Wang Zaizheng for being able to read and learn words, while he could only watch secretly from the sidelines.Wang Shijing moved these things aside. \u201cWhen next spring begins, Dad will find someone to take you to classes.\u201d\u201cDad?! Really?! \u201d Wang Qing couldn\u2019t believe his ears.Wang Shijing raised his hand and touched the red-eyed Wang Qing as he said, \u201cDad will not let you and Nizi suffer in the future.\u201d\u201cDad\u2026\u201d Wang Qing burst into tears and clenched his mouth to prevent himself from crying aloud. His heart was too bitter. But Wang Nizi cried aloud. It was too hard for them without parents around. Wang Shijing took the two children who had suffered too much into his arms and swore. \u201cFather is sorry that he made you suffer.\u201d\u201cDad\u2026\u201d Wang Qing and Wang Nizi grabbed their father\u2019s clothes and wept. Wang Shijing hugged the two children tightly. His body was also tense, but he felt even more sorry for his two children.\u201cDon\u2019t hate your mother, it was not easy for her either.\u201d\u201cWuu\u2026\u201dThe two children cried so hard that they couldn\u2019t catch their breath. Wang Shijing patted them. \u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u00a0you might wake up your little father. Look at what other good things your little father has bought.\u201dWang Qing first withdrew from his father\u2019s arms and then vigorously wiped his face. Wang Nizi also looked up. \u201cFather, will the little father be good to me and my brother?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Wang Shijing wiped his daughter\u2019s tears. \u201cYour little father wants to make new clothes for you and even bought you new shoes. Never mind what other people gossiped about. Your little father will be nice to you.\u201dWhen Wang Nizi withdrew from her father\u2019s arms, she was still a little scared. \u201cThe second aunt, sister -in-law, and cousins all said that my father would no longer want me if he married little father and that he would beat us, scold us, and refuse to feed us when he had his own children.\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s one-eye depth was icy-cold as he coaxed in a not-so-gentle voice. \u201cIn the future, don\u2019t pay attention to the people from that side of the family. Father will want you even if little father has children in the future. You will still be father\u2019s children. Your little father is not like that either. From now on, our family will live our own lives. Remember it.\u201d\u201cFather, I will remember it.\u201d Wang Qing put his arm around his sister. Looking at her brother, Wang Nizi nodded obediently and whispered, \u201cFather, I will remember.\u201dRubbing the heads of the two children, Wang Shijing continued what he was just doing. There was also an oil paper bag on top of a bag filled with paper, so Wang Shijing picked it up and knew what it was without opening it. Directly putting the paper bag into Wang Nizi\u2019s arms he said,,\u201cYour little father even brought you snacks. Open it and have a look.\u201dSnacks! Wang Qing immediately helped his sister open the paper bag and the fragrant and beautiful snacks became imprinted in his eyes. Drawing loud exclamations from the two children, Wang Shijing said, \u201cEach of you will eat one piece and the rest will be eaten at night. You should have eaten enough at lunch.\u201dWang Qing and Wang Nizi eagerly picked up a piece of the snack and stuffed it into their mouths. While the two children were eating, Wang Shijing continued to unpack.A large pile of meat, a pile of seasonings, there were even herbs? Wang Shijing also bought some meat, but definitely not this much. Hmm? There were even apples and pears!Wang Qing and Wang Nizi, who had just finished eating one snack each, looked at the pile of meat, bones, and fruits, and felt that their mouth watered again.Where did little father get the money? Was it their little father\u2019s dowry silver? The two children swallowed saliva. Wang Shijing poured out all the things as he looked at the two children,.\u201cWhat the family bought and ate, don\u2019t say it outside. When people ask, just say it was ordinary family food.The two children nodded heavily.Wang Shijing first took the books, brushes, and inkstone into the room. These thing were bought by Shao Yunan. Whether to give the two children to use would be arranged after Shao Yunan woke up. Then, he took all the meat and other things into the kitchen, which was already almost full. The two children also went back to their room to rest. Wang Shijing then divided the meat he bought into two parts and took it out.He was able to successfully separate from his family because of Zhao Lizheng and the patriarch\u2019s contribution. His family will have no choice but to trouble Zhao Lizheng and the patriarch in the future, so Wang Shijing decided to send some meat to Zhao Lizheng and the patriarch before calling forth Uncle Wang and a few other families to come over for dinner tonight.Zhao Lizheng and the patriarch were embarrassed to accept Wang Shijing\u2019s meat, which was not a cheap thing. Now that Wang Shijing separated from his family, his life was not easy. However, Wang Shijing insisted that the two families should accept the meat, but the families immediately returned his gift.The Zhao Lizheng family gave some vegetables and eggs. Since Wang Shijing had no land now, he could only buy these things from other families. Patriarch Wang Wenhe also gave vegetables and eggs. These days every household\u2019s eggs were saved to sell for money and each chicken farmer would raise no more than\u00a0 seven or eight chickens. At present prices, one egg could be sold for two copper coins.After sending the stuff, Wang Shijing ran to Uncle Zhou and Aunt Zhou\u2019s house in the west of the village to talk to Aunt Zhou about making clothes and quilts. The Zhou family was the foreign family in the village, so there were only two or three family members surnamed Zhou in the whole Xiushui Village.Uncle Zhou\u2019s name was Zhou Cai and the surname of aunt Zhou was Li, they had a son named Zhou Tianbao who burned out his brain as a child and become a little demented. So even at the age of 20, he could not marry. Zhou Tianbao was born thick and strong, and was able to do farm work. But he still needed to be taken care of in his everyday life.Shao Yunan said that he wanted to make clothes, so Wang Shijing\u2019s first thought was to seek Aunt Zhou\u2019s help. Sure enough, Wang Shijing said he wanted Aunt Zhou\u2019s help to make clothes for the family of four, as well as two quilts and mattresses, giving a total of 300 copper coins. Aunt Zhou was overjoyed. Her son was a little silly and the Zhou family\u2019s land was not much. Plus these years the tax was high, so everything outside was also sold more expensively. These 300 copper coins were equivalent to 20 days of short work outside. Uncle Zhou and Aunt Zhou felt that it was too high, but Wang Shijing disagreed with them.Clothes for four people\u2026 16 pieces in total, plus quilts, and mattresses would need a lot of work and effort. if Shao Yunan wanted to make more, he would add more money. Their family did not know how to make clothes, so from now on they had to come to aunt Zhou. The clothes they make must be suitable and comfortable, and they will also add some income to the couple. This was also a step to deepen the relationship between Wang Shijing, who had been away from home for three years and was now separated from the family and people in the village.Wang Shijing was so generous that Uncle Zhou and Aunt Zhou were embarrassed. They didn\u2019t help much on the day Wang Shijing moved, so now Aunt Zhou immediately took some vegetables for Wang Shijing. They were all grown at home, so they didn\u2019t cost any money. When Wang Shijing came home again with his hands full of vegetables, they didn\u2019t have to buy food for three days.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he got up the house was dark. Just as he still sleepily pushed the door open, someone immediately called out to him.\u201cLittle father.\u201d\u201cNizi, what time is it?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dTwo people came out of the kitchen. It was Wang Shijing and Wang Qing. Only then did Shao Yunan come back to his senses and asked again, \u201cWhat time is it? I seemed to have slept for a long time.\u201dWang Shijing spoke up, \u201cIt\u2019s past ten o\u2019clock. You must be hungry.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Noticing that all three of them were busy and even Wang Nizi was washing a large pot of vegetables, Shao Yunan rolled up his sleeves and asked, \u201cIs there someone coming for dinner tonight?\u201dWang Shijing said apologetically, \u201cI invited the people who came to help yesterday to come over for dinner, because I will have to trouble them in the future. Most of the meat you bought will be used up and the meat I bought was sent over to Zhao Lizheng and the patriarch.\u201dShao Yunan didn\u2019t mind Wang Shijing taking his own initiative, let alone using \u2018his\u2019 purchases. Although the two did not have a relationship as husband and wife, they were going to live together\u2026 at least for a while.Shao Yunan said indifferently, \u201cThose things were bought to be used. When are they coming?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll ask Qing to call them when the meal is ready.\u201d Seeing that Shao Yunan didn\u2019t mind, Wang Shijing became relieved. He did not want to take advantage of Shao Yunan, but he was not in the village for five years counting both of the times he was away, so he had to settle into the village now. He will always deal with these people in the future.In the village, if anything happens to anyone\u2019s family, they will take the initiative to help the people they interact with. The people who helped him yesterday were also the people he was willing to visit more in the future. He might have separated from his family, but not from people in Xiushui Village. Having a good relationship with the villagers will also be good for his four person family and the easiest way to know each other was to exchange courtesy.Shao Yunan said, \u201cI\u2019ll wash my face first and then prepare dinner. I don\u2019t trust your cooking skills. You go and wash the dishes. The water is cold so don\u2019t let Xiao Nizi touch the cold water. Qing can help me burn the fire, while Xiao Nizi can play by herself.\u201dWang Nizi immediately said, \u201cThe water is not cold. I can wash vegetables. I can do a lot of work.\u201d As far as she could remember, she has never \u2018played.\u2019Shao Yunan walked over and pulled Wang Nizi up and brought her to the kitchen. \u201cBefore was before, now you have to make a habit of not touching cold water.\u201d Pulling the cloth towel to wipe Wang Nizi\u2019s hands, Shao Yunan educated her. \u201cLook how cold your hands are. If girls touch too much cold water they can easily get sick. When the guests come to the house later, father will buy some snacks. So you can take them out and share them when they come over. In a few days, father will go to the county town and buy them for you.\u201dWang Nizi blushed and felt that her little father was so gentle that it made her think of her mother. When she thought of her mother, she thought of the most difficult days for her and her brother after her mother left. Wang Nizi\u2019s eyes could not help turning red, seeing this Shao Yunan squatted down and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Xiao Nizi?\u201dTo tell you the truth, Wang Shijing\u2019s two children were really sensible and clever, unlike the bear children he knew. Wang Nizi bowed her head and held her father\u2019s hands instead as she said shyly, \u201cDaddy, you are so nice.\u201dShao Yunan smiled and pinched Wang Nizi\u2019s face. \u201cWell, Daddy likes you. Okay, you go get the snacks, and little daddy will cook. I will stew a lot of meat for you. \u201cWang Nizi raised her head and showed a big innocent smile. Wang Qing and Wang Shijing were watching from outside. Wang Shijing rubbed his son\u2019s head. \u201cGo and help start the fire. Dad will wash the vegetables.\u201dWang Qing sniffled and went into the kitchen in silence. Shao Yunan patted Wang Nizi before she ran out of the kitchen to get some snacks. Although she was sad to part with them, she listened to her little father who said that he would still buy them for her in the future.Wang Shijing had already prepared a mixture of white flour and cornmeal for steamed buns. Shao Yunan took out the seasoning that Wang Shijing had put away and took six eggs to crack into the bowl. There were more than a dozen people coming for dinner in the evening so he had to prepare enough dishes.\u201cBrother Shijing, bring out the wine you brought back today.\u201d When Wang Shijing, who was washing vegetables outside heard this, he shouted. \u201cNizi, bring out the wine!\u201d\u201cAi.\u201d Little Nizi\u2019s voice was cheerful and crisp. Wang Qing, who was sitting in front of the fire, couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cLittle father, if people see this they might say something.\u201d\u201cSay what?\u201d Shao Yunan looked down. Wang Qing\u2019s little face looked serious and embarrassed in the light of the fire. \u201cSay that our family has too many good things and will gossip.\u201d This was good stuff? The original body owner in Shao Yunan\u2019s head was stimulated a little as he rolled his eyes toward the sky. He bent down and rubbed Wang Qing\u2019s head. \u201cLittle father and your father will block the mouths of others, so you can eat with confidence.\u201dWang Qing pursed his lips and could not help but whisper a reminder. \u201cGrandma will not be happy if she finds out.\u201d Shao Yunan coldly snorted in his heart. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if she is happy or not. We can\u2019t not live a good life just to make her happy. Whether she is happy or not has nothing to do with our side of the family. Your father and your grandparents have already written a separation contract, so from now on they have nothing to do with us and we have nothing to do with them. Don\u2019t be afraid of them.\u201dWang Qing raised his head and looked at his father for a while as he bowed his head and uttered a heavy \u201cmmm.\u201d Grandmother, second uncle, and aunt were bitter, and the indifference of aunt and uncle was Wang Qing\u2019s nightmare. Now that his father came back and his little father seemed to be very powerful, Wang Qing prayed in his heart that he and his sister will never have to go back to the old days.If he still couldn\u2019t see how miserable the two children were living in the past, Shao Yunan would be blind. Wang finished washing the vegetables and came in. Shao Yunan fastened his apron and said, \u201cSee what else you have to prepare. The kitchen is mine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go borrow the table.\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201d Shao Yunan picked up the kitchen knife and cut the vegetables first, leaving the meat for last.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wang Shijing borrowed three tables and not only invited the people who helped him yesterday, but also invited the two sons of the Zhao Lizheng family, Wang Wen the patriarch\u2019s son, as well as the village doctor Sun Langzhong, grandfather of the two brothers Sun Er Jiang and Sun Xiao Jiang who came to help yesterday. Wang Shijing wanted Sun Langzhong to check Shao Yunan and his two children. It\u2019s not that Wang Shijing didn\u2019t invite Zhao Lizheng and the patriarch, but it\u2019s just that it was a bit inconvenient for the two people to come forward on an occasion like this.Before the guests entered the courtyard, they said, \u201cit smells good.\u201d The guests only thought it smelled good, but Wang Qing and Wang Nizi felt it was even more fragrant. They thought that the dishes cooked by their little father smelled better than the ones they ate at the restaurant,There were many people and it was cold at night, so Shao Yunan didn\u2019t make a plate of dishes. A pot of crispy pork stewed with sauerkraut \u2013 sauerkraut was a gift from others, a pot of pure braised pork, a pot of braised ribs with stewed potatoes, a pot of fish and eggplant casserole, a pot of white radish and meatball bean and mushroom soup, and then the only stir-fried dish \u2013 scrambled eggs with leeks.Wang Shijing was considered the head of the family so Shao Yunan asked him to accompany his guests. When the dishes were all done, Shao Yunan filled three portions of each and brought them out in pots with Wang Qing. As soon as the dishes came out, it became more lively.\u201cIt smells good, Shijing\u2019s wife, your craft is good.\u201d\u201cThis looks even better than the food in the restaurant!\u201d\u201cWhat kind of dishes are these? I\u2019ve never seen them before!\u201d\u201cShijing, you are so lucky!\u201dNo one asked them where they got the money to buy all the meat. Wang Shijing let Shao Yunan sit beside him, while Wang Qing and Wang Nizi were led away by the fourth aunt. Wang Shijing\u2019s gloomy aura subsided a lot as he took the wine and poured it for the several elders present. He stood up and said, \u201cI just got back and my family is still counting on my uncle, aunts, and brothers to take care of me.\u201dWang Xing\u2019s father, Uncle Wang, immediately said, \u201cShijing, your family\u2019s situation is clear to all of us. The village is full of gossip, but please ignore it. You and Yunan should take care of Qing and Nizi, and live a good life. We, the elders, have watched you grow up and we know how much you have suffered. We also know how much Qing and Nizi have suffered.\u201dThe others immediately agreed. \u201cYes. Shijing, we will all help you in the future. Things will become better.\u201dWang Shijing said with some excitement, \u201cThank you Fourth Uncle and thank you everyone. I would like to toast all the elders with this cup of wine.\u201d The elders all picked up their bowls and drank the wine with dignity. Wang Shijing wiped his mouth and filled the cup up again before saying, \u201cThis bowl is for all my brothers.\u201d\u201cBrother Shijing, if there is anything you want us to do in the future, just ask.\u201dWang Xing, Sun Er Jiang, Sun Xiao Jiang, Wang Zhuanghua, the four young men close to Wang Shijing first took their cups of wine, before the others also followed.Tilting his head, Wang Shijing drank it again in one gulp. After two cups of wine, Wang Shijing sat down and picked up his chopsticks before urging everyone to eat. Shao Yunan poured a little wine, stood up and with his action, the crowd immediately stopped eating and drinking.Shao Yunan said with a smile on his face, \u201cBrother Shijing and I came together due to misfortune, but it was also due to fate. I\u2019m a straightforward person. Sometimes my temper comes up and I don\u2019t care about anything, but I hope that everyone can take care of it. I am new here and I don\u2019t know what is going on in the village. If there\u2019s anything wrong, just tell me. Brother Shijing and I don\u2019t have anything now, but we will in the future. We will make our life prosperous, so you can come to us for help. I will also love Qing and Nizi as my own children.\u201dWhen Shao Yunan finished his words, there was a moment of silence and it was Aunt Wang who spoke up first. \u201cYunan, Aunt Wang can see that you are a good person. You have also seen the situation of Shijing\u2019s family, so Shijing don\u2019t blame the fourth aunt for speaking boldly. Your family really needed to find a wife with a temperament like Yunan, otherwise, not to mention the other things, I don\u2019t even know how many grievances Qing and Nizi would have to suffer in the future. It\u2019s good that your family separated, so you can finally live your life in peace and quiet. Yunan, you and Shijing should live a good life. Qing and Nizi are very understanding children. Shijing and the two children will be left to you.\u201dShao Yunan raised his wine cup. \u201cFourth Aunt, you can rest assured. I will do just as I said. I propose a toast to everyone with this bowl of wine.\u201d Everyone picked up their wine bowl, and a few young men even coaxed, \u201cSister-in-law, after this meal, Brother Shijing will definitely not be able to leave you.\u201dShao Yunan drank the wine with a smile. During that time, Wang Shijing glanced at him. Shao Yunan\u2019s cheerfulness has won a lot of favor from everyone, so after drinking a cup of wine, everyone opened up to eating and drinking. Wang Qing and Wang Nizi had a big lunch, but now they still kept stuffing food into their mouths. Their little father\u2019s cooking was better than the one in the restaurant!Wang Shijing\u2019s excitement also increased, as Shao Yunan\u2019s cooking skills greatly exceeded his expectations. It may also be because the burden in his heart was gone and the person he married was not like he had thought. Although he and Shao Yunan are not really husband and wife, Wang Shijing had a lot of expectations for their future days.The wine that Shao Yunan bought was considered one of the good wines here, so everyone was satisfied with eating and drinking till they were full. Shao Yunan did not have a big appetite and became full after eating one steamed bun. He got up and left the table first and went to the kitchen after he had eaten enough and just whispered a few words to Wang Shijing before leaving. As soon as Shao Yunan left, Uncle Wang, who was sitting at the same table as Wang Shijing, whispered to him. \u201cShijing, you should be careful in the future. Don\u2019t do whatever you are told to do like you used to. Yunan is smart, there are things you can discuss with him.\u201dThis table was full of sensible people, so Uncle Wang was not afraid of them gossiping outside. What he meant was actually very straightforward, which was not letting Wang Shijing be bullied by his own family in the future. Shao Yunan was a very smart person, so it should be alright for Wang Shijing to listen to Shao Yunan more.Wang Shijing nodded and said, \u201cHe is a good one. I have nothing to do with my family now, so I won\u2019t take care of the rest of my family affairs unless it\u2019s a marriage or funeral.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you understand.\u201dShao Yunan went to the kitchen to cut fruit. He ate a lot of meat today, so he wanted to eat something refreshing now. Fruits were rare here, but it was nothing to Shao Yunan. If he eats them, he can always buy more later. As he was cutting the fruits, someone came in and Shao Yunan turned his head.\u201cFourth Aunt.\u201dThe person who came in was Aunt Wang and as soon as she saw Shao Yunan cutting the fruits, she immediately said, \u201cOh, why are you still preparing apples and pears? They are very expensive! Auntie knows how you feel, but don\u2019t do this in the future. You got nothing from your family, so you should save money to build a house and buy land in the future.\u201dShao Yunan was thinking of how to explain the origin of the money and now was the perfect moment, so he said in a serious manner, \u201cShijing picked up some beautiful stones when he was fighting in the war and he gave them to me. They looked quite rare, so I thought I should see if I can exchange them for some money. As a result, I went to the pawnshop and I met the Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion\u2019s boss. After looking at my stones, he immediately said that he would buy them. I never thought that these few stones could be exchanged for silver. Otherwise, Shijing and I wouldn\u2019t have been able to treat everyone to meat and wine.\u201dAunt Wang was surprised. \u201cStones can be exchanged for silver?\u201d\u201cI just found out about it.\u201d Shao Yunan wiped his hands and took out a stone from his pocket. \u201cI still have one left.\u201d Aunt Wang moved forward and exclaimed, \u201cThis is a stone? Isn\u2019t this meat?\u201d Shao Yunan shoved the stone into Aunt Wang\u2019s hand. \u201cFeel it, it\u2019s a stone.\u201dAunt Wang stared at it from up close and became extremely surprised. \u201cThis looks like a piece of cooked meat. How could this be a stone?\u201d She touched it and even took a bite and then\u2026 \u201cOuch, It\u2019s really a stone!\u201dShao Yunan smiled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s a stone. I sold three stones, but now this kind of meat stone is quite rare. Then he smiled and sighed. \u201cThese stones were brought by brother Shijing with his life, so I would be reluctant to sell them if I had a choice.Upon hearing this, Aunt Wang hurriedly stuffed the stone back into Shao Yunan\u2019s hand and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. There is only one piece left, so you should put it away and not sell anymore. Don\u2019t buy so much meat or wine in the future. We all know your feelings. It will not be too late to buy it when your life becomes better.\u201d\u201cFourth Aunt is right.\u201d Shao Yunan put away the half palm-sized jade. Aunt Wang then came forward and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t let those people in the old house know about this stone, especially Shijing\u2019s mother or she will ask for it.\u201dShao Yunan continued to cut the fruit as he just said coolly, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of her. If she dares to come and ask for it, I\u2019ll let her know what the consequences are. Fourth Aunt, brother Shijing and I will not deliberately look for trouble, but if they find me on their own, they can\u2019t blame me for being impolite. We have bought so many things today, it\u2019s impossible that they don\u2019t know about it. But they can make a scene as much as they like.\u201dWhen Aunt Wang heard this, she became even more relieved. \u201cI hoped you felt like this. I was really afraid that you would be bullied to death by the other side.\u201d After a pause, Aunt Wang said hesitantly, \u201cShijing used to be too soft-nurtured and couldn\u2019t protect himself, or even Qing or Nizi. Although their mother ran away with someone, we also understand that in that home, she really couldn\u2019t live. Don\u2019t take it personally. Since Shijing married you, he will definitely treat you well.\u201dShao Yunan smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not that careful. Now that Shijing is separated, they can\u2019t hold anything against us. Fourth Aunt, you can tell people how we got the money, so that people won\u2019t gossip behind our backs.\u201d\u201cIf you care about it I will speak about it outside.\u201d Aunt Wang was worried about whether Shao Yunan would be difficult to get along with, but now she liked Shao Yunan a little bit. After the two of them stayed in the kitchen for a while, Aunt Wang took this opportunity to tell Shao Yunan in detail about Wang Shijing\u2019s family, so that he would not suffer losses in the future.When Shao Yunan and Aunt Wang came out of the kitchen, they immediately attracted a round of applause. Everyone was happy and satisfied with the meal. There were also snacks before the meal and fruits after the meal, so everyone was a little embarrassed that they ate so much. They just helped a bit, but these people were so grateful to them.There was almost no food left as Wang Shijing asked Sun Er Jiang to take the rest of the soup and water back, so he could mix it with the pig food, adding some oil and water for the pigs. The Sun family raised two pigs, so Sun Er Jiang was not polite.The host and guests enjoyed themselves and before they left, Aunt Wang, Aunt Zhou, and Sun Er Jiang\u2019s mother, Aunt Sun Xia, washed all the dishes. Shao Yunan didn\u2019t stop them because he didn\u2019t like cleaning up after the meal. The guests were all gone and Shao Yunan didn\u2019t see that one of the guests looked back at him when he left. Wang Shijing went to boil water to wash, while Shao Yunan called Wang Qing and Wang Nizi into the house.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fierce \u201cHusband\u201dCH 10.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 10.1There were no tables and chairs in the room, so Shao Yunan asked the two children to sit on the kang and said, \u201cLet\u2019s not eat before we go to sleep, you ate a lot tonight.\u201d The two children lowered their heads in embarrassment, but Wang Qing boldly raised his head again and said, \u201cLittle father\u2019s cooking is delicious.\u201d Wang Nizi also nodded vigorously at the side.Shao Yunan rubbed Wang Qing\u2019s head, quite happy and asked, \u201cWhat do you two usually do during the day?\u201d Wang Qing reined in his relaxed expression as he replied, \u201cCut wood, feed chickens, feed pigs, cook, pick vegetables, go to the fields, and wash clothes.\u201d Wang Nizi grabbed her brother\u2019s hand. \u201cI wash clothes, feed pigs, feed chickens, light the fire, and water the garden.\u201dShao Yunan, who had already heard a lot from Aunt Wang, still failed to control his anger and asked, \u201cDid your cousin also do this?\u201d The two children shook their heads together and Wang Qing said with a straight face, \u201cMy cousin wanted to study.\u201d\u201cWang Zhisong didn\u2019t care?\u201d Wang Qing and Wang Nizi again shook their heads in unison and Wang Nizi even said timidly, \u201cLittle Uncle wanted to study.\u201d F*ck studying! That family is nothing more than a bunch of bastards! The children in the countryside always started to work early, but they were still their grandchildren and Wang Qing and Wang Nizi had to work all day long, while the boy who was older than Wang Nizi didn\u2019t do anything! Also, Wang Nizi was only four years old!The hands of the two children were so rough that they didn\u2019t look like something that belonged to children. Just now Dr. Sun took the pulse of the two children and said that the two children were weak and he had to take good care of them, otherwise something might go wrong in their future. If Wang Nizi went on like that, it might even affect her fertility in the future.He had never met Wang Shijing\u2019s nephew, but just thinking of his sister-in-law, he could guess that the boy must be like a pig and that strange old couple abused both big and younger ones. If Wang Shijing did not resolutely separate from that family, he would definitely write him a letter of divorce! Shao Yunan, who was spoiled by his grandparents and parents, and was their sweetheart, once again despised old lady and old man Wang in his heart.Shao Yunan continued, \u201cIn the future, I will still let you do what you can for the family, but I won\u2019t let you do so much as before.\u201d As he spoke, he brought over two pairs of calligraphy cards. \u201cFrom tomorrow on you will practice calligraphy according to this, but little father will teach you first how to hold the brush. Recently there were a lot of things to do at home, so when the work is over, little father will teach you how to read and write. Brother Qing should learn and so should Nizi.\u201dWang Qing\u2019s eyes brightened, but Wang Nizi was surprised. \u201cCan I learn too?\u201d \u201cOf course. Little father also has a lot of words he doesn\u2019t know, so he will learn them with you.\u201d Then another person spoke out, \u201cI\u2019ll learn too.\u201d It was Wang Shijing who came in at some point. Shao Yunan raised his eyebrows. \u201cOf course you also have to learn. You are the head of the family.\u201dWang Shijing came over, picked up Wang Nizi and sat down. He let Wang Nizi sit on his lap before saying to Shao Yunan, \u201cSoon we\u2019ll be busy with farming and after the farming period we will have to prepare for winter, then it\u2019s the New Year when no one is free. When spring starts, we will find someone to send Qing to school.\u201dIt was only September now and the farming season was about to begin. Thinking about it, Shao Yunan said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll teach them how to recognize words when I\u2019m not too busy. There is also no need to send Qing to school. He will be seven years old at the beginning of next spring, so the best way is to send him to a private school directly. This will cost a little more money, but if we want to teach Nizi we need to find a female teacher to teach her.\u201d Suddenly thinking of something, Shao Yunan asked, \u201cIs there a place to teach girls to play the zither? Learning how to play the zither as a hobby a little earlier or later would also be fine.\u201dWang Nizi\u2019s eyes lit up at the word zither. Wang Shijing looked at his daughter and said to Shao Yunan, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I can go ask around. Nizi is still young, so you can teach her how to read and write first. Then we can take our time in finding her a female teacher who also knows how to play the zither. You can also send her to learn embroidery first. She will also need to know how to do it when she grows up. I know that girls from big families also learn it.\u201dShao Yunan shook his head. \u201cIf Nizi likes that, we can find someone to teach her later. She\u2019s young now. Embroidering is not good for her eyes.\u201d \u201cAll right.\u201d Shao Yunan then went back to the main subject. \u201cQing, Nizi, each of you should take a set of our treasures of the study and a calligraphy book to your room. From tomorrow on, you are not allowed to be lazy or complain. I will hit the palm of the hand of anyone who is lazy or complains.\u201d\u201cDaddy, I won\u2019t be lazy. I want to learn!\u201d Wang Qing almost shouted. \u201cI want to learn, too. After I can read, grandma and auntie won\u2019t beat me or scold me anymore. Cousin Zheng will also not bully me anymore.\u201d Wang Nizi\u2019s childish words made Shao Yunan a little sad and Wang Shijing\u2019s expression a little more gloomy. He really had \u2018good\u2019 relatives.Giving Wang Shijing such a look, Shao Yunan said, \u201cOkay, I believe that you can hold on. Now take your things to your room and wash up.\u201d Wang Nizi jumped down from her father\u2019s lap and with the help of her little father and her father she happily took the four treasures of the study and the calligraphy book to her room with her brother.After the two children washed carefully according to their father\u2019s request, they went to bed holding the calligraphy book, touching and looking at it. Shao Yunan took a bath, then went back to the house because he still had things to do. Wang Shijing, who boiled another pot of water, didn\u2019t see anyone for a long time.Sitting cross-legged on the Kang and writing on the low table, Shao Yunan thought that he should go to the city or at least buy a desk, so his writing would not become so distorted. When the door of the room opened, Shao Yunan subconsciously looked up and almost lost his breath.Wang Shijing had obviously just showered. He didn\u2019t wash his hair, but his hair bun had become loose and his upper body was naked. He had a cloth towel on his shoulders and only a pair of\u00a0 coarse cloth trousers on his lower body. He hadn\u2019t completely dried off, so the water beads slid down his chest and along his eight pack to his pants. Shao Yunan\u2019s mouth suddenly became dry. One, two, three, four\u2026 It was really eight! For a pure zero, this tall and strong body with several scars, which was clearly a very manly body, was simply naked temptation!Wang Shijing\u2019s height was considered tall in Xiushui Village. Regardless of his body or face, he looked more like a pure northern man. In contrast, Wang Tianyan was short and fat, and even looked a little like old lady Wang. He never saw Wang Zhisong, so he wasn\u2019t sure. In fact, if you took a closer look at Wang Shijing, he looked a bit like old man Wang, except that he was like a much more mutated species.As soon as he came in, Wang Shijing closed the door and went up to the bed to look through the clothes box on the bed. Wang Shijing also had several scars on his back and just a glance at these scars told you how narrowly he escaped death on the battlefield. Wang Shijing put on his coat and loincloth and when he turned around, he saw Shao Yunan staring straight at him. Wang Shijing lowered his eyes and took a cloth towel to wipe his wet hair. Getting off the bed to go out again, Shao Yunan\u2019s eyes subconsciously followed after him.Damn, he was definitely deliberately trying to seduce him! He took a deep breath and pressed his heart. Shao Yunan patted his face trying to calm down. He has been a virgin for 26 years and now he\u2019s only 16 years old, so he should be able to stand it.It\u2019s just that this body was too good. Looking down at what he had just written, Shao Yunan diverted his attention. At this time, Wang Shijing came back in, holding an old wooden box that looked quite heavy. \u201cYunan.\u201d Shao Yunan looked up reluctantly, still a little uneasy inside. Wang Shijing sat on the bed and put the wooden box on the bed table. \u201cKeep it.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Shao Yunan moved the paper and inkstone away. \u201cThings I brought back from the war.\u201d Wang Shijing slipped a copper key into Shao Yunan\u2019s hand. Shao Yunan only felt a burst of burning where Wang Shijing touched his skin. The other person\u2019s hands were really hot!Things he brought back from the war? Shao Yunan looked at the key in his hand and blinked. He used the key on the copper lock on the box and opened it. Then he gave a low cry and stared at the other person. \u201cIs these yours?\u201dWang Shijing nodded and said calmly, \u201cThe court has no money and military pay is not much. The general tacitly allowed us to take some seized money privately. This is the money I kept and saved while in the army.\u201d After a pause, Wang Shijing avoided Shao Yunan\u2019s gaze. \u201cDuring these two years of forced labor, I also earned some silver. Except for what was given to my mother, I was going to give the rest to Qing and Nizi\u2019s mother.\u201dShao Yunan suddenly didn\u2019t know what to say, as a warm current swept through his heart. There was a lot of gold, silver, and jade jewelry in the wooden box. There were also more than a dozen silver ingots large and small, as well as some loose silver and copper coins. There were even ten gold ingots of varying sizes, not to mention jewelry. Shao Yunan estimated that there were thousands of taels of gold and silver alone. Sure enough, no matter what world you were in, rich people still existed!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The general I followed was very brave and seized a lot of money when he wiped out several mountain bandits who left a lot of money behind. I pawned some jewelry for silver.\u201d After a moment, he also added truthfully, \u201cThe rest of the jewelry was originally intended to be left to Qing\u2019s mother. Now that his mother and I have divorced, what do you think about these jewels?\u201dShao Yunan closed the lid of the box and asked, \u201cDo you hate your ex-wife?\u201d Wang Shijing shook his head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Her life was too bitter. She was a kind-hearted and hardworking woman, but in my family her life was not easy, especially when I was not around. I can only apologize to her.\u201dDo you still love your ex-wife? Shao Yunan swallowed this sentence and just asked curiously, \u201cHow did you collect all these things, that they were not discovered?\u201d Wang Shijing clenched his fist, his voice lowering a bit. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring it home. I found a place to hide it before I came back to the village.\u201dSo a child could be taught!\u201cMy parents don\u2019t like me and by extension, they don\u2019t like Song and my two children. When I was still there I was able to protect her. But when I was gone, because she was soft natured her life became even worse. Since she wanted to go, I am also willing to let her go free. Yunan, in the past I could not help myself, but now, I am already separated from my family. Since you are my wife, from now on you are in charge of the family.\u201dWhen he said these things, Wang Shijing\u2019s expression was calm. He had already known for a long time that he was not liked in his family. He did not even have the slightest resentment for Song\u2019s departure from the family.Shao Yunan did not find himself blushing because of the other party saying, \u2018You are my wife,\u2019 but he suddenly no longer dared to directly look into Wang Shijing\u2019s eye and just pretended to ask casually, \u201cSince you have given me all your belongings, are you not afraid that I would run away? We\u2019ve only been married for a few days.\u201d Shao Yunan didn\u2019t think much of Wang Shijing\u2019s ex-wife.\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cHow do you know I won\u2019t?\u201d Shao Yunan raised his eyes unconvinced, but met a deep gaze that made his heart beat a little faster. \u201cI know you won\u2019t.\u201d Wang Shijing said seriously. \u201cYou are a capable person. My appearance is ruined. I am blind in one eye and I have two children. I am not worthy of you and in this marriage you are aggrieved.\u201dShao Yunan subconsciously mumbled, \u201cI\u2019m not a woman. What\u2019s the point of being aggrieved? It\u2019s good that you have children, so I don\u2019t have to give birth to them.\u201d Yuck yuck! Why was he talking about giving birth to a child? Shao Yunan hurriedly rushed to change the subject. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask me where I got the money today?\u201dWang Shijing glanced at Shao Yunan\u2019s red earlobes and said, \u201cI believe your money comes from the right place. If you want to tell me, you can tell me. But if you don\u2019t want to, I won\u2019t ask you.\u201d After a pause he added, \u201cThere are also other people from the village that joined the army, but they weren\u2019t with me. However, they know about military pay. I am the eldest son and since my family wasn\u2019t separated, I knew that I couldn\u2019t keep the money to myself. Originally, I wanted to give my parents some money, but when I came back to see Qing and Nizi like this and Song left, I said that my military pay was used to treat my wounds.\u201d\u201cIf I buy land to build a house, my family\u2019s side will make trouble again. But now that you said that it was money made from selling stones, it would be difficult for others to ask how much money they were sold for. Even if they are curious, this money can be used. We will have a busy farming period soon. I want to buy some land and renovate the house, otherwise it will be very difficult to survive the winter. We can only build a new house at the beginning of spring.\u201dShao Yunan thought that Wang Shijing would be like Wang Dali, kind of like a stuffy gourd, so he didn\u2019t expect him to talk with him about these things, with every sentence very clear. But the main thing was that he was not a foolish and filial person. No matter what era, there are plenty of people who are stupid when it come to filial piety.Men who have their own ideas in the feudal ancient society and take care of their children and family could really be regarded as good men. But this is also the luck of this era. There was no Dong Zhongshu who \u2018dismissed a hundred non-Confucian scholars from the government.\u2019 Although there was some similarity to Confucianism, in general it was enlightened with all kinds of ideas that could be practiced in the world.The State of Great Yan also advocated filial piety, but not to the extent that it developed into a monstrous kind of horrible period where filial piety could kill children at will. Clans and families existed and had a certain power, but they were still restricted by the law\u2026 not allowing the father to be unkind, but not the son to be unfilial. Otherwise, how could Wang Shijing get his freedom with marriage? If parents wanted you to marry, not to mention separating from the family without death. Shao Yunan was so reckless that he would have been killed a long time ago, but now it was up to him to make a decision with his family.Wang Shijing was forced to get married, but now he gave all his savings to the person he had married for only three days. Since he married this person, he would give him his trust and sincerely want to live a good life with him. Shao Yunan had never met such a person in modern society. If Shao Yunan was upset at the thought of this marriage and this strange \u2018husband\u2019 when he first arrived, now he could calmly deal with this unfamiliar marriage.Shao Yunan pulled over his bag of money and opened it. Wang Shijing\u2019s one eye became obviously surprised. With just a glance he found that there were hundreds of taels of silver. He never thought Shao Yunan would have so much money. It was definitely not given to him by the Shao family and must have been earned by selling stones. How else could he have so much money?Shao Yunan opened the box and put all of his silver in it, leaving only the copper coins. Wang Shijing\u2019s one eye flashed as Shao Yunan looked at him and said, \u201cAt home you\u2019ll not wear a eye patch, it\u2019s uncomfortable to wear it.\u201d Wang Shijing tightened his jaw and said in a deep voice, \u201cIt will scare you.\u201d Shao Yunan said, \u201cI am a big man, how could I still be afraid of your scars?\u201dWang Shijing looked profoundly at Shao Yunan before he raised his hand to take off his eye patch. Then Shao Yunan saw Wang Shijing\u2019s injured eyes for the first time. The scar came down vertically and horizontally from the center of Wang Shijing\u2019s left eye. There was some dirt in the corner of Wang Shijing\u2019s left eye, which didn\u2019t seem to be very good.Seeing Shao Yunan\u2019s calm expression, Wang Shijing breathed a sigh of relief. Shao Yunan then asked, \u201cCan\u2019t you see at all?\u201d Wang Shijing said in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s all black. The military doctor said it was useless.\u201d Shao Yunan felt a little uncomfortable. He got out of bed, put on his shoes and went out. Wang Shijing watched him leave, squeezing the eye patch in his hand out of shape.Shao Yunan went to the kitchen. After closing the door, he used his mind to take some spiritual water into the washbasin. There was only one drop of spiritual milk all day so Shao Yunan didn\u2019t plan to use it. In the basin, he scooped up two more ladles of water from the water tank and put some more spiritual water in the tank. Then Shao Yunan took a cloth towel and went out.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Watching Shao Yunan bring a basin of water in, he immediately wanted to get up. \u201cThere is no hot water. I will warm some. This water is too cold.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s for you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re afraid of the cold.\u201d Shao Yunan put the basin directly next to Wang Shijing. Anyway, the quilts were all wrapped up, so he was not afraid of wetting the bed. He wrung the cloth towel and gave it to Wang Shijing saying, \u201cIn the future, you don\u2019t need to wear an eye patch if there are no outsiders around. The eye patch is not breathable and not good for your eye. You are the father of Wang Qing and Nizi, they need to get used to it. You wipe your eye and cover it for half a day. There is some dirt in the corners of your eyes.\u201dWang Shijing vigorously squeezed the eye patch in his hand, then put it on the table before taking the cloth towel to wipe his eyes. In the meantime, Shao Yunan was busy saying, \u201cLeave some water in the cloth, don\u2019t twist it too dry.\u201dWang Shijing wiped the corners of his eyes. He also knew that he had a lot of dirt in the corners of his eyes every day. He just hadn\u2019t thought that Shao Yunan would get water for him to wipe his eyes. He didn\u2019t know if it was because the water was prepared by Shao Yunan, but the water felt very cool when he wiped his eye. The burning pain and swelling that had been troubling him since the beginning of his injury had been eliminated by a lot.\u201cWipe it a few more times, I\u2019ll continue to speak.\u201d\u201cThen speak.\u201d Wang Shijing obediently wrung the cloth towel again and wiped his eyes.\u201cI told Aunt Wang that the money I got was from selling the stones and it was not entirely a lie. I had a few rare stones in my hand and I wanted to sell them for money. It was more convenient for me to hide a few stones instead of silver in the Shao family. Those few stones were peculiarly shaped, so I directly took them to the Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion to sell them.\u00a0 Things are precious when they are rare, so the owner of the Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion offered me 500 taels of silver for the three stones. He also bought the design of these three stones, which they thought could be carved out of jade and sold for a large price. So I sold them.\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s one eye was full of surprise. Shao Yunan took out the piece of flesh stone that fooled Aunt Wang and said, \u201cHere, I have another piece in my hand. It\u2019s very special, isn\u2019t it?\u201dWang Shijing took it in amazement. This is a stone?\u201d\u2026 \u201cThis is a stone?\u201d\u201cYes. Aunt Wang even took a bite to make sure it wasn\u2019t meat.\u201d Shao Yunan smiled wickedly. Wang Shijing\u2019s brow wrinkled. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity to sell such a peculiar stone. I should have given you the money earlier. How about seeing if you can redeem it? Those pawned jewelry can earn a lot of silver.\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s reaction exceeded Shao Yunan\u2019s expectations, making his expression soften in an instant. He thought, \u2018In fact, this person was a very honest and sincere person at heart.\u2019Shao Yunan said, \u201cThe three pieces I sold are not as peculiar as this one, so I had no problem with selling them. This jewelry can\u2019t be pawned. It\u2019s an antique and will be worth a lot of money in the future. You said that I will now be in charge of the family, then listen to me.\u201d Please forgive Shao Yunan for unconsciously looking at jewelry from thousands of years ago with the eyes of a modern person.Wang Shijing twisted his cloth towel and wiped his eyes for the third time.\u00a0 He still wanted to say something else, but was interrupted by Shao Yunan. \u201cYou have been a soldier for three years, so you definitely had some adventures. It\u2019s also normal to find some rare things and people would believe you if you said it. I might have to use it as cover in the future\u201d\u201cThere are some things I can\u2019t tell you about right now, but I will tell you everything when the time is right. So how could I explain to outsiders? When people ask, all you have to do is nod. If I say I picked up the stone, someone will inevitably ask where it was found, so it is more appropriate to put it on you. If there is something difficult to explain in the future, it would also be better to put it on you.\u201dWang Shijing nodded, indeed it would be better to conceal Shao Yunan\u2019s involvement. He also believed that the other side would tell him about those unknown things as their days together grow longer.Shao Yunan then said, \u201cYou just said that you want to buy land to build a house. I mean, we can buy less land first and buy the house we live in first. It can always have other uses in the future. But the house we settle down in in the future should be bought somewhere else. I want the area to be bigger and quieter. I also don\u2019t want so many residents around.\u201d Wang Shijing replied, \u201cI will listen to you. I will buy ten acres of land first.\u201d\u201cWell even if you buy more we can\u2019t take care of it so it would only stir up some gossip. After all, we have no income. Umm, no income in the eyes of others. If we spend too much money, they will start to think about how much we sold these stones for. The house can still be built after the spring according to the original plan, but I will earn money openly and honestly before then.\u201dWang Shijing said, \u201cWhat do you want me to do? Just say it. I don\u2019t have the same skills as you, so I\u2019ll do whatever you want for the family.\u201dShao Yunan restrained himself from raising the corners of his mouth and just raised the piece of paper he was writing on. \u201cI thought of a few small businesses to earn money, but they are not my most ideal way to earn money. We can do some small business first and accumulate some original capital. When we get the opportunity, we can then do what I want.\u201dWang Shijing immediately asked, \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Shao Yunan was not shy in answering. \u201cI want to sell tea and wine. I\u00a0 have different tea-making skills and I can also brew different wines. But all this requires time and resources. It takes having your own tea trees and good grapes to make wine, so we need to find some seedlings first.\u201dWhen Wang Shijing heard this, he became extremely surprised. \u201cYou know how to make tea? Grapes? I have seen people grow grapes at the border. They would also make wine out of grapes, but they are very sour. I have tasted it and it doesn\u2019t taste very good.\u201d He deliberately ignored the obvious suspicion of how Shao Yunan, a person from Qingshan Village, could make tea and wine.Shao Yunan became excited. \u201cYou have seen wine?\u201d Wang Shijing nodded. \u201cSome people would drink it, but it wasn\u2019t very good. Sometimes there was also wine in the property we seized. It was said that this wine could only be bought by princes and aristocrats and was very expensive. There are merchants in this dynasty who also buy and sell it. Although it is not good, from what I heard, it is very valuable and only available in the capital. This is what I heard others say when we had nothing else to talk about.\u201dShao Yunan became even more excited. \u201cThen do you know where we can buy grape seedlings?\u201d Wang Shijing said, \u201cThey are sold in the north, most being\u00a0 closer to the border.\u201d\u201cI want to go\u2026\u201d Shao Yunan was very excited. He had excellent grape seeds of his own, but he couldn\u2019t take them out so abruptly. \u201cBrother Shijing, can you find a way to help me get a batch of grape seedlings? Even grape seeds are fine, I know of a way to grow them.\u201dWang Shijing nodded forcefully. \u201cI have a brother in the army who is from there. I\u2019ll write a letter and ask him to help me get some. Seedlings die easily, but seeds shouldn\u2019t be too difficult. Which kind do you want? There seem to be many kinds of grapes.\u201dShao Yunan wanted to shout, but he almost screamed out, \u201cAll of them!\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll write tomorrow.\u201d After a moment of silence\u2026 \u201cYou write, I can only write a few words.\u201d\u201cNo problem!\u201d Shao Yunan didn\u2019t expect it to be so easy. Then, Wang Shijing gave him another big surprise when he heard him say, \u201cThere are wild tea trees in the mountains around here. Some villagers would pick tea leaves and sell them. You can move a few plants and then cultivate some seedlings. The mountain on the west is not far from the village and there are no wild animals in the mountains, but I have seen wild tea trees there. You can remove all the ones over there.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He then spoke impatiently, \u201cBrother Shijing, can you show me to the west mountain tomorrow? If we can pick enough tea leaves, maybe we can soon get some money to build a house openly!\u201d\u201cAlright, but tomorrow morning after breakfast we will go to Aunt Zhou\u2019s house to take measurements first. In this way aunt Zhou can also help us look after Qing and Nizi when I take you into the mountains.\u201dShao Yunan\u2019s smile showed all of his teeth. \u201cBrother Shijing, you are my benefactor!\u201dWang Shijing closed his mouth and avoided Shao Yunan\u2019s burning gaze by wiping his eyes. But there was a faint smile in his one eye.At night, lying on the kang, although the two of them were in separate bedding the distance between them had shortened considerably. Shao Yunan was excited and Wang Shijing was obviously not asleep either.\u201cBrother Shijing, I want to go back to the county town the day after tomorrow.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cI want to buy two stone mills, one big and one small, as well as two new iron pots for making tea.\u201d\u201cFind people in the village to make the stone mill. Don\u2019t buy a ready-made iron pot. Go to the blacksmith shop and order them. The pots made this way are better. The iron pot for tea making has to be the best, right?\u201d Shao Yunan suddenly felt that he was quite lucky to meet Wang Shijing when he first came here.\u201cThen go and buy the land where we live first. I will decide how much land to buy after I see the tea trees. If a certain amount of tea can be made or if a few of the small businesses I have in mind can be done, you should buy more land preferably together with the land for our new house in the future.\u201d\u201cOk, it\u2019s up to you.\u201d The feeling of being in charge of the family was really good. Shao Yunan closed his eyes and became even more motivated for his future life.\u203bThe next day, not long after the rooster crowed, Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan got up. Shao Yunan told Wang Shijing to wash up first and when he was done, he gave him a new basin of water to wipe his eyes. Wang Shijing had slept well that night, where previously he couldn\u2019t sleep well due to the pain in his eye. Wang Shijing was not without doubts especially when the wet cloth on the eyelid brought him a burst of coolness. Perhaps, this was one of the things Shao Yunan said he could not tell him for now. Wang Shijing wiped his eyes silently and looked at Shao Yunan, who was busy in the kitchen.\u201cBrother Shijing, I don\u2019t know how to make noodles, before I learn it you should make the family some noodles.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cLittle father, I can do it.\u201d It was said by the early riser Wang Nizi, who was then followed by Wang Qing. \u201cLittle father, I can do it too.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re up so early.\u201d Shao Yunan, who was frying eggs in a large iron pot, poked his head out of the kitchen. Shao Yunan had the original owner\u2019s memory of making noodles, but he himself had never done it. The only kind of dough he could make was for dim sum. But when he has time, he will learn. As\u00a0 the owner of two restaurants, Shao Yunan was not averse to entering the kitchen.\u201cWe used to get up earlier.\u201d Wang Qing and Wang Nizi went into the kitchen, sniffing the scent that was very good. \u201cGo wash up. There is hot water in the basin. For breakfast there is porridge, steamed bread, and pickles with fried eggs. There were enough steamed buns leftover from the previous night for the four of them to eat.The two children immediately went to wash up and obediently washed their hands with the bath beans. Thinking of the promise of teaching the two children some calligraphy today, Shao Yunan said apologetically, \u201cQing, Nizi, little father has to go to the mountains with your father to look for something today, so you have to wait till I come back.\u201dWang Qing said understandingly, \u201cLittle father, go ahead.\u201d Wang Nizi also said, \u201cI will wait for my little father to come back to teach us.\u201d Shao Yunan put the fried eggs in a bowl. \u201cAnyway, little father has broken his promise, so I will make amends and cook a big meal for you when I come back.\u201dWang Qing and Wang Nizi smiled. Their dad came back and their little father was also very good. The two children were full of hope for their future, so their panic of being bullied by their \u2018stepfather\u2019 dissipated thanks to Shao Yunan\u2019s kindness.The four of them ate breakfast and Wang Qing and Wang Nizi both said they liked the fried egg very much. Wang Shijing didn\u2019t say whether he liked it or not, but he also ate it in two bites. After eating, Wang Shijing washed the dishes and cleaned up the kitchen before taking the cloth in his arms and taking Shao Yunan and his two children to the Zhou\u2019s house.Uncle Zhou and Aunt Zhou also got up early. When the couple came for dinner last night, they didn\u2019t bring Zhou Tianbao with them, but Wang Shijing still prepared food for them to take back to Zhou Tianbao to eat. Zhou Tianbao giggled foolishly when he saw the strange guest. Since he was troubling people to look after the children, Shao Yunan brought over the leftover snacks from yesterday. As soon as he came in, he gave three to Zhou Tianbao, which made Uncle Zhou and Aunt Zhou very embarrassed. Since they ate other people\u2019s food last night, it doesn\u2019t matter if they took care of the children.For fear that Zhou Tianbao would trouble Shao Yunan and the two children, Uncle Zhou took his silly son out to avoid it, while aunt Zhou measured them. In addition to pants, Aunt Zhou needed to make all the inside and outside clothes for the four people.Wang Qing and Wang Nizi were still children, so Aunt Zhou didn\u2019t mind making their inner pants. But Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan would need to do theirs themselves. Shao Yunan was wondering in his mind how long the pile of modern underwear in his space would last him. Aunt Zhou was taking measurements and teaching Shao Yunan how to make the simplest pants. Shao Yunan felt it was hopeless, while Wang Shijing listened very carefully. Wang Nizi on the side also listened very carefully. When she grew up, she would be the one to sew her little father and her father\u2019s clothing.Hearing that Aunt Zhou also knew how to make shoes, Shao Yunan immediately said that the shoes for his family of four would be given to Aunt Zhou in the future, Aunt Zhou just agreed with a smile.When Aunt Zhou finished measuring, Wang Shijing paid the money. Since they were all from the same village, there was no need to pay for delivery. Aunt Zhou also did not refuse to take care of the children and let Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan just go about their work. Shao Yunan specially told the two children not to wander off and then went home together with Wang Shijing to get a basket and bow and arrow for their trip up the mountain.Wang Shijing had been away from the village for five years, but he was no stranger to the mountains around the village. He grew up being treated harshly by his parents and had never felt the warmth of his parents for as long as he could remember. The half grown boy ate very poorly. When he was growing up, Wang Shijing didn\u2019t have enough to eat at home, while his mother gave all kinds of delicious food to his second brother to eat. In order to not starve, Wang Shijing often snuck into the mountains to find food, while also learning how to hunt by himself. So the mountains here were very familiar to him. Now that he has spent three years in the army, he was even less afraid of going to the mountains.There was no way up the mountain, so Wang Shijing opened up a path with a machete that he held in one hand, while his other hand held Shao Yunan\u2019s wrist. The morning\u00a0 dew made the mountain road unusually slippery and Shao Yunan\u2019s body was thin and frail. So without saying a word, Wang Shijing grabbed his wrist when they reached the mountain and did not let him break free. After walking for a while, Shao Yunan accepted his help, otherwise this journey would be very difficult for him.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not long after they started walking, Shao Yunan forcefully broke away from Wang Shijing\u2019s hand. When Wang Shijing turned back, he was walking to the side.\u201cThere are osmanthus flowers here! I can smell the fragrance of osmanthus.\u201d The solemnity in Wang Shijing\u2019s one eye immediately dissipated as he also tried to smell it, after which he called, \u201cPay attention to your feet. The grass is full of bugs and you should also be careful of snakes.\u201d Shao Yunan immediately stopped and turned his head. \u201cLead the way then, I can smell them from this side.\u201dWang Shijing walked in front of Shao Yunan and again grabbed his wrist and took him to find the sweet-scented osmanthus. After walking four or five meters, a track of sweet-scented osmanthus forest appeared in front of Wang Shijing, making Shao Yunan very happy. \u201cBrother Shijing, take note of this location, so when we build a new house we can transplant a few osmanthus.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Wang Shijing looked at the surrounding environment and carefully noted down the location of the sweet-scented osmanthus.\u201cLet\u2019s pick some flowers and make sweet-scented osmanthus dumplings to eat.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dWang Shijing went to pick the flowers and Shao Yunan told him to wait as he also went to pick them. Thinking that he might encounter tea trees, Shao Yunan had taken several cloth bags with him. He now took out one to pack the sweet-scented osmanthus. After filling it with sweet-scented osmanthus, he put it into his basket with satisfaction.The two men returned to their previous path and continued to walk deeper into the mountains. The dampness in the forest this season was relatively heavy, so Shao Yunan found several kinds of mushrooms. Wang Shijing was also used to picking mushrooms in the woods so with his guidance, the two men picked all the edible mushrooms.\u201cThe forest is really the richest treasure house ah.\u201d In the process of picking mushrooms, Shao Yunan also found Artemisia annua. This was something that Wang Shijing had never eaten before and regarded as a weed. Shao Yunan picked a large pile and threw some into the space when Wang Shijing wasn\u2019t paying attention. Artemisia annua was one of the best ingredients of hot pot.Aah! Hot Pot! Shao Yunan was hit in the head by a brilliant light. Wang Shijing, who was holding several large mushrooms that were as thick as a child\u2019s wrist, came back to his senses when he saw Shao Yunan staring dumbly at the edible wild vegetable that he called \u2018Artemisia\u2019 previously in his hand.\u201cYunan?\u201d Shao Yunan looked up, his eyes glowing. \u201cI\u2019ve thought of a small business we can do first.\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s one eye met with his smile. \u201cWhat small business?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go back and I will tell you.\u201dShao Yunan\u2019s joy infected Wang Shijing as he put all the mushrooms in his own back basket while also putting the artemisia that was in Shao Yunan\u2019s hand into his own back basket. Then he pulled Shao Yunan\u2019s wrist as they continued walking.\u201cBrother Shijing, are there any tigers or wolves here? Didn\u2019t you say there were wild animals here?\u201d Wang Shijing continued to open the road as he said, \u201cWe would need to go deeper to encounter any wild beast, so we won\u2019t go deeper. There are no wild animals in the mountains and forests by the village, but sometimes wild boars will come down from the mountains. When the crops are about to be harvested, the village will arrange some patrols and dig some straps to prevent wild boars. They would also organize people to go into the mountains to kill the wild boars.\u201d\u201cWild boar, it must taste good.\u201d This was one of the sadnesses of being a modern man. Wang Shijing immediately said, \u201cIf you want to eat it, I\u2019ll hunt it for you later.\u201d Shao Yunan looked at Wang Shijing\u2019s broad back and suddenly was under the illusion that this \u2018man was very reliable.\u2019 Taking a deep breath and suppressing the restlessness in his heart, Shao Yunan continued to keep an eye on the path.\u201cBrother Shijing, look\u2026 is that a chestnut?\u201d Various mountain treasures made Shao Yunan very happy. The tea trees had not been found yet, but the rich variety of mountain products along the way was exciting enough. Wang Shijing also found a large red, sour fruit. After Shao Yunan\u2019s careful observation, he decided that it was very similar to goat\u2019s milk fruit. Goat milk fruit tasted sweet and sour. It could be eaten raw or could provide food coloring, but even more importantly, it could be made into wine!Shao Yunan remembered that in his \u2018previous life\u2019 he had seen the goat\u2019s milk in June and July, but here there were still some fruits\u00a0 even in September. They were quite ripe and those that weren\u2019t were golden yellow. This goat milk shrub was two to three meters high. The ground around it was thickly covered with rotten fallen fruits. Shao Yunan seriously suspected that goat\u2019s milk fruit here could bear fruits just like that in modern times. But it was also a good thing for Shao Yunan, it was money!\u201cBrother Shijing, remember this place. We will come back here tomorrow and pick all of these! With this we can not only make wine, but also jam!\u201dShao Yunan picked two fruits and ate one of them by himself. It was sour and sweet; so delicious! Then he stuffed one into Wang Shijing\u2019s mouth. Wang Shijing\u2019s one eye became a little bent. Shao Yunan reached out and took off his eye patch. \u201cIt\u2019s just you and me here. Don\u2019t wear it. Isn\u2019t it delicious?\u201dInstead of grabbing his eye patch, Wang Shijing said, \u201cWhen village people go into the mountains and see red sour fruit they will pick it up as a snack, but no one comes here. I will take you back here tomorrow.\u201dShao Yunan rolled his eyes and said, \u201cThen let\u2019s come a little earlier and don\u2019t let other people see it. I want all of these.\u201d Exclusivity is the best!\u201cAlright.\u201dShao Yunan really had no goat milk fruit in his space, so he quickly picked a handful of the goat milk fruit and threw it into the space when Wang Shijing had his back to him. Sure enough, there is no other way! There was Wang Shijing, a reliable person and there was also this mountain. He couldn\u2019t say that he would get rich here, but his life would be guaranteed! Half of the big stone weighting in his heart has been removed, so Shao Yunan became much more relaxed.Wang Shijing, who was walking in front, also felt Shao Yunan\u2019s relief and joy, so he held Shao Yunan\u2019s wrist a little tighter. Can he look forward to a real home, too?Wang Shijing\u2019s back basket was almost full before they could even find the shadow of the tea trees. Shao Yunan found a wild peach tree, with very small peaches. Shao Yunan picked a few and decided that he would come for the rest the day after tomorrow. What pleased Shao Yunan most about this peach tree was not the peaches, but the prospect of peach gelatin, which was very nourishing.Of course, he had to pick it all. If it wasn\u2019t for the fear of exposing his space, Shao Yunan wouldn\u2019t dare to leave this thing here until tomorrow. In addition, there were also fungus, stone fungus, wild chrysanthemum, and so on\u2026 As long as he saw something that could be eaten and could be taken away today, he absolutely scavenged it clean. It was not until Shao Yunan started sweating that Wang Shijing stopped again and pointed ahead saying, \u201cYunan, look at that. Isn\u2019t that a tea tree?\u201dShao Yunan immediately walked excitedly to Wang Shijing\u2019s side. Looking forward, he exclaimed, \u201cAncient tea tree! There is an ancient tea tree here!\u201d Shao Yunan put down the basket with bright eyes and ran over. Wang Shijing also put down his basket and hurriedly followed him. In front of them was an ancient tea with more than a dozen trees. In modern society, the ancient tea tree only grew sporadically in the southwest. Shao Yunan never thought that there would be an ancient tea forest in this ordinary village!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 24": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fierce \u201cHusband\u201dCH 12.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 12.2Shao Yunan slapped his forehead. This was the ancient times, so the environment was not polluted by people and open to the public, so even ancient tea trees could grow so big! Then it should also be normal to have patches on ancient tea trees! Shao Yunan plucked a leaf into his mouth and chewed, his breath changed. This was definitely more than three hundred years! These tea trees, if transplanted to his space\u2026 no, there was no need to transplant them. Even if the branches were transplanted and he used his knowledge and experience, he would be able to make the best tea in this world!Shao Yunan grabbed Wang Shijing and said excitedly, \u201cI want all the tea trees here to be mine! Mine!\u201d Even Wang Shijing\u2019s blind eye bent under this smile. \u201cGood, let\u2019s buy this mountain so everything here will be yours in the future.\u201d\u201cBuy! You must buy it!\u201d Shao Yunan was worried again. \u201cWe can\u2019t buy them now, but what if someone else comes over, I want all of them to be mine.\u201dWang Shijing couldn\u2019t resist patting Shao Yunan and telling him to not worry. \u201cNo one from the village will come to this mountain. We can buy our land and new house land just below the mountain and then buy a few acres of wildland into the mountain pass. That way, no one will be able to come over. When we can buy it, we will buy all of the mountain.\u201d\u201cBrother Shijing, it\u2019s great to have you!\u201d Shao Yunan licked his lips. He couldn\u2019t wait to taste what the tea tasted like thousands of years ago. Earning money was just his secondary goal! Wang Shijing liked this look on Shao Yunan, so he patted him trying to calm him down. \u201cI\u2019ll go pick tea for you.\u201dShao Yunan regained his senses and ran back to his back basket, taking out several cloth bags before running back and stuffing four of them into Wang Shijing\u2019s hands and saying, \u201cI\u2019ll see what leaves to pick first and then we\u2019ll split up.\u201d Wang Shijing disagreed. \u201cThis tree is high. I\u2019ll pick it for you. Just tell me which leaves to pick. If we can\u2019t finish picking them today, we will come back tomorrow.\u201dShao Yunan wanted to pick all these ancient tea leaves right away, but he was really not good at climbing. These ancient tea trees were very tall, but it also meant that these tea leaves would be of very high quality! Shao Yunan took a deep breath to calm himself down and said, \u201cThen, I will teach you how to pick them.\u201dPicked tea usually had one bud and one leaf, or one bud with two leaves, but even one bud with three or four leaves was okay. Sometimes only a bud was picked if needed. It was autumn now and the quality of the tea was not as good as that in the spring. That was also Shao Yunan\u2019s greatest regret. If it was before the rainy season, the picked tea leaves would be much more fragrant. However, Shao Yunan was confident that the autumn tea leaves could also produce a high-quality flavor. Besides, here, even the autumn tea would certainly be sought after.Wang Shijing listened carefully to Shao Yunan\u2019s explanation on how to pick the tea properly and after watching Shao Yunan\u2019s demonstration, he started to climb the tree. What made Shao Yunan even happier was that these all have accompanying crab feet. Crab feet were the spirit of ancient trees. Shao Yunan had only seen them on ancient Pu\u2019er trees before. This ancient tea tree forest tends towards Longjing. Longjing ancient trees have long been extinct in modern times and he already considered himself lucky to see crab feet on such an ancient tree from thousands of years ago.The crab foot looked a bit like a small coral and like a crab\u2019s foot. This ancient tea tree forest had not been visited by anyone, so the crab feet on the branches of the trees were tender green and\u00a0 the older ones were dark yellow. They smelled strongly of bacteria, algae, and tea.Wild crab feet were very valuable medicinal materials, which tasted refreshing and sweet. Some old tea farmers even thought that wild crab feet would grow together with ancient tea trees, absorbing the aura of the tea trees and becoming the essence themselves. It could also be used to make drinks to cure all kinds of poison. The only thing to pay attention to was that the crab feet were cold and should not be eaten excessively. Pregnant women should also be careful and not eat them. You could also stew chicken with crab feet\u2026 Shao Yunan drank the tea made with crab feet and Pu\u2019er before, which tasted very special. This crab foot growing on the ancient tree of Longjing must have even more special flavor.Wang Shijing picked the crab feet and then dropped it from the tree, while Shao Yunan picked it up and put it in the basket. There were twenty-one ancient trees that he could see in this area and it was hard to say if there were more deeper in the forest. Wang Shijing did not feel comfortable with Shao Yunan running far away by himself, so he didn\u2019t let him search further. Shao Yunan told himself not to be greedy. In modern society, even if you were able to find one, it would already be big news. He already found 21, so even if there were still more deeper in the forest, even if they were not found there was nothing to regret.Wang Shijing picked the tea leaves from tree to tree without complaining and if he was uncertain about something he asked Shao Yunan from the tree. It was not until Shao Yunan himself was hungry that he realized that Wang Shijing had been in the trees for a long time and had already picked half of the old trees, so he said a little guiltily, \u201cBrother Shijing, come down and have a rest. Eat something and drink some water. I\u2019ve lost track of the time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not tired, I\u2019ll finish picking this tree and then come down.\u201d When Wang Shijing said that, Shao Yunan felt even more guilty. He also realized that Wang Shijing only had one eye, so he would be even more tired than normal people after such intense tea picking.The more he thought about it, the more guilty he felt. So he took out a kettle from his back basket and then went to a position behind Wang Shijing and quickly took out a bottle to pour a small drop of spirit milk into the kettle. The water in the kettle itself has been mixed with spiritual water and now it was even mixed with a drop of spiritual milk. Shao Yunan also did not care whether Wang Shijing would notice something strange.After a long time, Wang Shijing\u2019s with his sweating head finally finished picking the tea leaves and came down from the tree. Shao Yunan immediately came forward with a cloth towel in his hand and poured some water from the kettle on the cloth towel before handing it to him. \u201cWipe yourself quickly.\u201dWang Shijing took it and wiped his face and eyes before cooling his forehead for a moment. A coolness instantly hit his brain, so that his original tiredness became almost cheerfulness. The burning left eye was also immediately soothed. \u201cLet\u2019s take a break and get something to eat and then we\u2019ll go back and come back tomorrow.\u201dWang Shijing, who wiped his face and eyes, said, \u201cThere is still half left, let\u2019s pick it up before going back. I am not tired. I remember that there was also another place with many tea trees and it was probably around here. But if we want to go deeper, I am afraid that there would be some wild animals so it wouldn\u2019t be safe. After finishing picking here, we don\u2019t have to come here tomorrow and can only pick up the goat\u2019s milk fruits and peaches.\u201dShao Yunan felt both guilt and gratitude, so he hurriedly handed over the kettle. \u201cDrink some water. I\u2019ll go get the dry food.\u201d Wang Shijing took the kettle and took a big sip, then his one eye went round. This water! Looking at Shao Yunan, who was bending over to get dry food, Wang Shijing slowly swallowed the unusually sweet water and took another big gulp before walking over.The two people found some prominent tree roots to sit on. Each of them had a mouthful of water and dry food. In order to ease his inner guilt, Shao Yunan chose his words carefully. \u201cWhen the tea is ready, I will go to the shopkeeper of the Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion. The owner behind him is from the capital, so he has many shops under his name including Yizhang Xuan. Tea must also be one of his interests and I dare to say that the tea I made is definitely unique to the Great State of Yan. It is precious because it is rare and it will certainly fetch a high price.\u201d\u201cWell, it definitely can.\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s unhesitating trust made Shao Yunan especially comfortable. If Wang Shijing always asked him why or chased after the reason he would be troubled. The fact that Wang Shijing didn\u2019t ask many questions and supported him wholeheartedly was the biggest reason Shao Yunan could stay at ease.\u201cBut if the village people know, I\u2019m afraid this forest can\u2019t be kept, so I still have to find a few small businesses that earn money first to cover it. In the future I may collect tea with the village people, but not right now. The method of picking tea is very particular, otherwise it would go to waste.\u201dWang Shijing said, \u201cWe can wait until we buy this mountain forest before we use the village people to collect it. Before starting collection we can also teach the villagers how to pick the tea. You can also ask Li Zheng to help you with this matter.\u201dShao Yunan nodded and said, \u201cThe small business I just mentioned is making sesame paste.\u201d\u201cSesame paste?\u201d Wang Shijing had never heard of it before.Shao Yunan said, \u201cIt\u2019s a sauce made of black sesame or white sesame. It can be mixed with cold noodles in summer and in winter. It can be eaten with meat, vegetables, and other seasonings. When you make sesame sauce, you can also get sesame oil, which can be used in cooking and soups. We can do it ourselves at home and then sell it at the county town or see if Yizhang Xuan wants to buy it. If it sells well, we can also collect sesame seeds from the villagers.\u201d After drinking a mouthful of water, Shao Yunan continued to express his idea. \u201cIn the future, I intend to focus our family\u2019s main business on tea and wine. I can also think of other small businesses that we can hire people to do or directly give as favors to other people, which could also be considered a distraction. What do you think?\u201dWang Shijing nodded repeatedly. \u201cYou have many ideas, so I will listen to you. It is good to sell a favor. Now there are a lot of people watching our family. If our family suddenly gets richer, it will only cause trouble and gossip in the village. But if there are more rich people in the village, it will attract less opposition. For example, the fourth uncle, Uncle Sun\u2019s family, and Uncle Zhou\u2019s family are good. If we can bring the patriarch and Li Zheng\u2019s family together, our family will have less trouble in the future.\u201dShao Yunan said, \u201cWhen the time comes to sell to whom, it is up to you to decide. Tomorrow, we will not go to the mountains. We will need to spread the tea leaves to dry them. It is also too late to order an iron pot, so we will use the one we have at home first to fry the tea. I\u2019ll draw a picture and mark the size so you can go to the county town tomorrow to order a pot, order two first. When the tea is ready, we will go into the mountains to pick the goat\u2019s milk fruits.\u201dWang Shijing said, \u201cTeach me how to make tea. When there are more tea leaves in the future, you would be too busy to do it alone. You also have to teach Qing and Nizi how to write and read so you would become too tired.\u201dShao Yunan couldn\u2019t help but look at Wang Shijing who said this very seriously and just smiled. \u201cI definitely want to teach you first. We cannot focus on the small workshop. We are going to open a big tea house in the future. If you don\u2019t know how to talk business with people, how can you manage the people under you?\u201dWang Shijing froze, he did not expect that Shao Yunan would be willing to let him intervene, let alone that Shao Yunan would say such words. The meaning of the words seemed to really treat him as the head of the house.Shao Yunan looked at those ancient tea trees and said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to hide it from you. At first, I was reluctant. Not because you are blind in one eye or have two children, but because It\u2019s impossible for me to like and get married to a person I don\u2019t know.\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cBut after you split up so cleanly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that bad to stay.\u201d Shao Yunan said with a smile, looking at the silent Wang Shijing. \u201cWe\u2019ve only been married for three or four days and we still have a long time ahead, right?\u201dWang Shijing raised his eyes and said, \u201cWell, there are long days ahead. In the past, I couldn\u2019t protect Qing\u2019s mother, but I won\u2019t let you suffer like Qing and Nizi\u2019s mother. In the future, you will be in charge of the family\u2019s affairs.\u201dShao Yunan snorted out a laugh, \u201cYou are the one in charge.\u201d Wang Shijing said earnestly, \u201cWhoever has an idea in our family is in charge. In the future, when the family earns money, you will take care of it.\u201d Shao Yunan snickered again. This man that looked much older than his 26 years really reminded him of the word \u201ccute\u201d at this moment.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shao Yunan also put the bag of sweet-scented osmanthus in Wang Shijing\u2019s back basket to avoid contaminating the tea leaves. Wang Shijing\u2019s movements became more and more skillful, so after a little more than an hour he finished picking the remaining half of the tree. Their trip to the mountain was extremely fruitful, so without any further delay the two men packed up and went down the mountain.Their speed of going back was fast and because Shao Yunan no longer looked around, Wang Shijing led him down the mountain smoothly. The two first went home to put their things away before going out again to pick up the children. But who knew that as soon as the two men went to the village, they would meet a woman who would say gloatingly, \u201cShijing, your mother has been looking for you all day, you should quickly go home.\u201dShao Yunan\u2019s good mood immediately dissipated and Wang Shijing\u2019s face even darkened a little. But he only said \u201cgot it\u201d and continued to go home with Shao Yunan. He didn\u2019t let go of Shao Yunan\u2019s wrist, while Shao Yunan also did not try to break free.\u201cIt must be about the stone.\u201d Shao Yunan hummed coldly. \u201cI\u2019ll take you home first and then I\u2019ll pick up Qing and Nizi.\u201d Just as Wang Shijing\u2019s words fell, someone called out to him again, \u201cShijing!\u201dThe two looked over and it was Aunt Li who looked very anxious. The other party trotted all the way over and hurriedly said, \u201cShijing, they are asking about your stones. She went to your house in the morning. Because you weren\u2019t there, as soon as she heard that Qing and Nizi were at Zhou\u2019s house she took Wang Tianyan and his family over and made a big fuss, saying that you had hidden money from here before splitting up so you have to hand it over. They also want the family patriarch to open the ancestral hall, saying that you were unfilial and had to be punished according to the clan rules. The two children were frightened, so aunt Zhou and I hurriedly sent the two children to Zhao Lizheng. You should hurry up over there.\u201dShao Yunan gritted his teeth, \u201cDamn it. I hope she doesn\u2019t expect that a tiger would act like a sick cat. I\u2019d like to see how she obeys the rules!\u201dSeeing a donkey grazing not far away, Shao Yunan pulled out his hand from Wang Shijing\u2019s and unloaded the basket on his back before putting it on the ground with force. Then he said angrily, \u201cShijing, you take the stuff home. If I don\u2019t spoil Wang Songzhi\u2019s reputation today. My fu*king name is not Shao!\u201dBefore Wang Shijing and Aunt Li realized it, Shao Yunan rushed to the donkey. As the original owner was still dumbfounded, he climbed on the donkey and fiercely smacked its ass. The donkey gave a cry and ran under Shao Yunan\u2019s command.\u201cOh! That\u2019s my donkey!\u201d The owner of the donkey shouted and rushed up after them.Shao Yunan knew how to ride a horse, so it was no problem for him to ride the donkey. But the donkey had no saddle, so he still had a little bit of a hard time riding it. However, Shao Yunan was filled with anger. He now knew that he had to give them a taste of ruthlessness when dealing with the shameless people of the Wang family. The reason why the Wangs were so arrogant was because they had a possible scholar in their family. But no matter which era, the reputation of the scholar was most important. If the Wang family could do such a shameless thing, he will see if the scholar of the Wang family could also be so shameless!\u201cYunan! Yunan!\u201d Aunt Li became so anxious that she pushed Wang Shijing hard, \u201cGo after him!\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s face became tense as he said to Aunt Li, \u201cAunt Li, I\u2019ll put these things at your house first. Can you lend me your ox cart? I will also need to trouble you with telling Lizheng\u2019s side that Yunan has gone to look for Zhisong?\u201d\u201cOh, go quickly. I\u2019ll tell Lizheng\u2019s side right now!\u201d Aunt Li scolded old lady Wang\u2019s family to death in her heart and then helped Wang Shijing bring the two baskets full of things to her home. As soon as Wang Xing and Sun Er Jiang heard that Shao Yunan had gone to find Wang Zhisong, they immediately said that they would go with Wang Shijing.Wang Shijing did not refuse and just drove the ox cart in the direction of the county town. Shao Yunan\u2019s reaction also startled him, but next to it a new complex emotion also rose in his heart. This was originally something he was supposed to solve, but Shao Yunan\u2019s actions made him feel once again that they were a family now.At Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house, old lady Wang, Wang Tianyan, and Wang Guo were all waiting angrily. After Aunt Wang and Aunt Zhou sent the two children over here, they also stayed at Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house and did not leave. Zhao Liu, the wife of Lizheng, was very angry. She has never seen such a shameless family. It was simply unreasonable for such a family to have a child.Old lady Wang had already called over the family patriarch, Wang Wenhe. The faces of both Wang Wenhe and Zhao Zheng were very bad. The latter was because he had to obstruct Wang Zhisong\u2019s status as a child student while Wang Wenhe did it out of consideration for the whole family. After Wang Zhisong\u2019s examination, the fate of the entire Wang clan was linked to him. Wang Wenhe was annoyed with old lady Wang, but he couldn\u2019t ignore the future of the entire Wang family, so this matter made Wang Wenhe stand in a very difficult position.The two children were taken to the inner room by Zhao Liu. While Zhao Lizheng\u2019s eldest son and daughter-in-law were sitting in the hall. Lizheng\u2019s eldest grandson, who had just returned from the private school, was now sitting in the inner room with his grandmother, Wang Qing, and Wang Nizi. Zhao Lizheng\u2019s eldest son, Zhao Yuande, married a male wife, a brother from the same clan named Zhao He. Usually, there would be no intermarriage between the same clan, but since Zhao He\u2019s parents couldn\u2019t have children they adopted him from his mother\u2019s family side into the Zhao family tree. Since he was not really a member of the Zhao family, there was no problem with this marriage.The couple only had one son, named Zhao Congbo, who was now ten years old and was studying in a private school in the county town. Although Lizheng and his wife were not satisfied that their daughter-in-law was a man and they only had one grandchild, they loved their eldest grandson very much and had great expectations for him.Fourth Uncle Wang and Fourth Aunt Wang ran in from outside. As soon as they entered the house, Uncle Wang didn\u2019t even look at the patriarch or old lady Wang and just said to Lizheng, \u201cZhao Lizheng, Shijing and Yunan are back, but Yunan went to the county school to look for Zhisong.\u201dAs soon as Uncle Wang\u2019s words fell, Zhao Lizheng and Wang Wenhe froze. Old lady Wang was also a bit confused for a moment. While Wang Tianyan just foolishly asked, \u201cWhy is he looking for Zhisong?\u201dWang Guo raised her voice and shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s useless for him to go looking for Zhisong!\u201d\u201cStupid!\u201d Wang Wenhe suddenly let out a shout, making Wang Guo so frightened that she fell off the stool. Zhao Lizheng\u2019s face trembled as Aunt Wang said cynically, \u201cYunan said he was going to ask Zhisong what to do about this matter.\u201d She didn\u2019t say that Shao Yunan probably wanted to discredit Wang Zhisong.Wang Wenhe stood up and shouted, \u201cWhere is Shijing? Why didn\u2019t he stop him?\u201dAunt Wang said, \u201cShijing couldn\u2019t stop him. Yunan robbed Ergouzi\u2019s family\u2019s donkey and ran to the county town. Shijing borrowed my ox cart and went after him together with Wang Xing and Sun Erjiang.\u201dWang Wenhe pointed to Aunt Wang before turning to old lady Wang who had not yet figured out the severity of the situation. \u201cYou\u2019re making a scene! If Zhisong\u2019s reputation is ruined today, I\u2019ll see what you\u2019ll tell him!\u201d With that, Wang Wenhe strode away. He also had to arrange for someone to stop Shao Yunan.Old lady Wang still didn\u2019t react, \u201cHow could this ruin Zhisong\u2019s reputation?\u201dZhao Lizheng said impatiently, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hurry up and let Wang Tianyan chase him? Shijing had already separated from your family. Not to mention that he just sold some stones, even if he really has some private money, you had no reason to make trouble now! The deed clearly states that Shijing no longer had anything to do with your family anymore! What is a county school? Yunan is a strong willed person. If he wants to make trouble in the county school, how will the teachers and fellow students in the school look at Zhisong? If Zhisong\u2019s reputation is ruined, he won\u2019t even be able to take the scholar exam!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The village\u2019s child student\u2026 Zhao Lizheng no longer cared about old lady Wang and hurriedly asked his eldest son Zhao Yuande to chase.Zhao Lizheng\u2019s action rattled fearless old lady Wang. \u201cHe, he really dared to go to the county school and discredit Zhisong\u2019s reputation?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, keep messing around!\u201d Zhao Lizheng ignored old lady Wang and shouted to Wang Tianyan, who was still confused about the whole situation, \u201cYou and Yuande go after him! If this goes badly, Zhisong\u2019s future will be ruined!\u201d Wang Tianyan looked foolishly at Zhao Lizheng and his own mother before running out in a panic.The patriarch said so and so did Zhao Lizheng, finally making old lady Wang feel some fear. She sat on the ground after her legs went weak and then howled. \u201cThis misfortune star!\u201d How can such a misfortune star marry into my Wang family!\u201dZhao Lizheng scolded her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of crying now?! If you hadn\u2019t made such a fuss, there would be no such thing! Shijing is also your son and the eldest one! He didn\u2019t take a single grain of rice from your family, but you are still asking him for money! Is there such a mother as you?! After all, this is your fault!\u201dOld lady Wang spilled the beans. \u201cHe didn\u2019t take a single grain of rice from me? He hid so much private money without saying a word and gave it all to this misfortune star! He is the eldest brother, but didn\u2019t send any money home. Does he not know how much Zhisong\u2019s school cost? He is not filial, and he won\u2019t let me have it!\u201dZhao Lizheng pointed at the unrepentant old woman and was so angry that he couldn\u2019t speak. Zhao Liu came out of the house. She was also so angry that she couldn\u2019t speak. What was up with all this crying in her house?\u201cWang Tianyan, why don\u2019t you hurry up and pick up your mother-in-law and take her back! Wait for\u00a0 Tianyan and his family to come back to talk about what is going on. We haven\u2019t even eaten yet after all the trouble they\u2019ve caused! My grandson is still hungry!\u201dWang Guo grumbled, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t because big brother was so unethical, how could such a big fuss be made?\u201d\u201cHurry back first!\u201d Zhao Lizheng was now too lazy to waste his words anymore with this unreasonable mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and just waved his hand to drive them away. When the patriarch left, so did Wang Tianyan. Wang Guo did not dare to cause trouble in Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house, so he just helped old lady Wang up.\u201cZhao Lizheng, you have to do something for us! We can\u2019t have such a wife in the Wang family!\u201d Old lady Wang cried and wept, still confused about the situation. Zhao Lizheng waved his hand again, shooing them away as he asked his little daughter-in-law to send them out. Li Zheng\u2019s little daughter-in-law and his youngest son half shoved old lady Wang and her daughter-in-law.After they went out, Zhao Liu scolded, \u201cShe thought she still had a say and just wanted to pick up a fight and scold people. That Shao Yunan already said that he separated from the Shao family. If she can get Shijing to divorce Shao Yunan, then she is really capable! I\u2019ll see if she can get what she wants!\u201dZhao Lizheng\u2019s wife really hated old lady Wang\u2019s family very much and was even disgusted with them. She had two sons, Zhao Yuande and Zhao Yuanqing who both attended private schools, but neither of them took the scholarship exam. After Wang Zhisong was praised by the private school master, old lady Wang constantly criticized Zhao Liu\u2019s family, showing off that her son was very smart and would definitely be a scholar in the future. Later, when Zhao Yuande married Zhao He, old lady Wang even laughed behind her back at Zhao Yuande\u2019s inability to study. Since her eldest son married a male wife, old lady Wang did not like male wives very much.This time, Wang Zhisong passed the scholarship exam, so old lady Wang started to say even more that the village will have to rely on their family\u2019s Wang Zhisong in the future. While also saying that the two sons of Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family were hopeless and the eldest grandson of Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family was probably as useless as his father. As a mother and grandmother, how could Zhao Liu tolerate others scolding her sons and grandson? Coupled with the fact that old lady Wang was not a good person and did not know how to behave as a human being, Zhao Liu always felt sick when she saw old lady Wang.After letting his wife scold for a few minutes to relieve her anger, Zhao Lizheng asked her to cook. Then he asked Aunt Wang, who had been silent all this time, \u201cDid Shijing\u2019s wife really go to the county school to look for Zhisong?\u201d\u201cReally, I wouldn\u2019t lie to you.\u201d Aunt Wang said. \u201cAs soon as Yunan heard that old lady Wang came to ask for the stone and money, he threw the basket from his back and didn\u2019t even go home. He just robbed Ergouzi\u2019s family donkey and went to the county town, saying that he would find Wang Zhisong to judge.\u201dZhao Lizheng took a deep breath and then sat down and slapped the table hard. \u201cEvery one of them is a heartless one!\u201dAunt Wang hummed, \u201cOriginally, it was the Wang family that didn\u2019t care. The family has been separated, what people sell and what kind of money they get, they shouldn\u2019t be interested about it. It\u2019s like Shijing wasn\u2019t their son. They forced Song to leave and now they also want Yunan to leave? Shijing already separated from their family, but have no land or house, and they still want to snatch away his money? Whoever heard it would say that it was unreasonable. Although I am also a member of the Wang clan, I also know that people can\u2019t force a tree to bend forever before it snaps. You can\u2019t be biased in favor of the Wang family in the matter of Shijing\u2019s family.\u201dFourth Uncle Wang also followed by saying, \u201cThis time it was really the Wang family that went too far. The deed of separation is written clearly. From now on, the two sides don\u2019t have anything to do with each other. This was written clearly in black and white. If it\u2019s not recognized later, who would believe in a separation deed after that? Wang Zhisong is a scholar. It\u2019s impossible for him to not understand this principle?\u201d\u201cAlas\u2026\u201d Zhao Lizheng sighed with a sad expression. He also had something to take care of, but he couldn\u2019t help wondering, \u201cDoes Shijing\u2019s wife really dare to go to the county school?\u201dZhao Liu said angrily, \u201cWe should also go there!\u201dZhao Lizheng said angrily, \u201cDon\u2019t talk too much, you should go and cook woman!\u201dZhao Liu went out angrily. It was difficult for her to quarrel with her family head when an outsider was around. Even if Wang Zhisong obtained the first prize, what good would it do to the Zhao family? This time, old lady Wang brought out Wang Wenhe, obviously to pressure the head of her family. Zhao Liu was the wife of Lizheng, so how could she stand seeing other people pressuring her husband.The county school was a forbidden place that is unattainable for most families and has a status comparable to that of the Yamen office, so that nobody would date to touch it at will. Even Zhao Lizheng did not believe that Shao Yunan would really have the courage to go to the county school to find Wang Zhisong. In fact, everyone present muttered to themselves, Aunt Wang, Uncle Wang, and even Wang Wenhe, who had left earlier did not believe it.The reason why they sent someone to chase after Shao Yunan was only to make a statement and give Shao Yunan an opportunity to scare old lady Wang, so his family could live in peace. People have their own thoughts, but how could they have thought that Shao Yunan really would dare to go to the county school? For a modern man, there is no school that he cannot be admitted to. Even if it was equivalent to the most famous school of the state of great Yuan in the capital for the State Scholarship, he would still dare to break in.Zhao Yuanqing, the second son of Lizheng, said on the side, \u201cIf you dare, wait until someone comes back. Wang Zhisong should also talk with the family patriarch to not let old lady Wang fool around outside anymore.\u201d Old lady Wang\u2019s surname was Zhu, but it was taboo to call her Wang Zhu, so after such a long time no one in the village called her by her original surname anymore.Zhao Lizhen sighed again. Wang Wenhe should be able to control Wang Dali\u2019s family, since their family was an important part of the Wang clan. Wang Wenhe\u2019s feelings were different from his. After all, he was not a member of the Wang clan. Even if Wang Zhisong obtains merit in the future, it will only bring fame to Xiushui village, but the glory and wealth would only be related to the Wang clan. He, Zhao Lizheng can only see Wang Zhisong\u2019s future merit.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After Aunt Wang and Aunt Zhou sent the two children over here, they also stayed at Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house and did not leave. Zhao Liu, the wife of Lizheng, was very angry. She has never seen such a shameless family. It was simply unreasonable for such a family to have a child.Old lady Wang had already called over the family patriarch, Wang Wenhe. The faces of both Wang Wenhe and Zhao Zheng were very bad. The latter was because he had to obstruct Wang Zhisong\u2019s status as a child student while Wang Wenhe did it out of consideration for the whole family. After Wang Zhisong\u2019s examination, the fate of the entire Wang clan was linked to him. Wang Wenhe was annoyed with old lady Wang, but he couldn\u2019t ignore the future of the entire Wang family, so this matter made Wang Wenhe stand in a very difficult position.The two children were taken to the inner room by Zhao Liu. While Zhao Lizheng\u2019s eldest son and daughter-in-law were sitting in the hall. Lizheng\u2019s eldest grandson, who had just returned from the private school, was now sitting in the inner room with his grandmother, Wang Qing, and Wang Nizi. Zhao Lizheng\u2019s eldest son, Zhao Yuande, married a male wife, a brother from the same clan named Zhao He. Usually, there would be no intermarriage between the same clan, but since Zhao He\u2019s parents couldn\u2019t have children they adopted him from his mother\u2019s family side into the Zhao family tree. Since he was not really a member of the Zhao family, there was no problem with this marriage.The couple only had one son, named Zhao Congbo, who was now ten years old and was studying in a private school in the county town. Although Lizheng and his wife were not satisfied that their daughter-in-law was a man and they only had one grandchild, they loved their eldest grandson very much and had great expectations for him.Fourth Uncle Wang and Fourth Aunt Wang ran in from outside. As soon as they entered the house, Uncle Wang didn\u2019t even look at the patriarch or old lady Wang and just said to Lizheng, \u201cZhao Lizheng, Shijing and Yunan are back, but Yunan went to the county school to look for Zhisong.\u201dAs soon as Uncle Wang\u2019s words fell, Zhao Lizheng and Wang Wenhe froze. Old lady Wang was also a bit confused for a moment. While Wang Tianyan just foolishly asked, \u201cWhy is he looking for Zhisong?\u201dWang Guo raised her voice and shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s useless for him to go looking for Zhisong!\u201d\u201cStupid!\u201d Wang Wenhe suddenly let out a shout, making Wang Guo so frightened that she fell off the stool. Zhao Lizheng\u2019s face trembled as Aunt Wang said cynically, \u201cYunan said he was going to ask Zhisong what to do about this matter.\u201d She didn\u2019t say that Shao Yunan probably wanted to discredit Wang Zhisong.Wang Wenhe stood up and shouted, \u201cWhere is Shijing? Why didn\u2019t he stop him?\u201dAunt Wang said, \u201cShijing couldn\u2019t stop him. Yunan robbed Ergouzi\u2019s family\u2019s donkey and ran to the county town. Shijing borrowed my ox cart and went after him together with Wang Xing and Sun Erjiang.\u201dWang Wenhe pointed to Aunt Wang before turning to old lady Wang who had not yet figured out the severity of the situation. \u201cYou\u2019re making a scene! If Zhisong\u2019s reputation is ruined today, I\u2019ll see what you\u2019ll tell him!\u201d With that, Wang Wenhe strode away. He also had to arrange for someone to stop Shao Yunan.Old lady Wang still didn\u2019t react, \u201cHow could this ruin Zhisong\u2019s reputation?\u201dZhao Lizheng said impatiently, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hurry up and let Wang Tianyan chase him? Shijing had already separated from your family. Not to mention that he just sold some stones, even if he really has some private money, you had no reason to make trouble now! The deed clearly states that Shijing no longer had anything to do with your family anymore! What is a county school? Yunan is a strong willed person. If he wants to make trouble in the county school, how will the teachers and fellow students in the school look at Zhisong? If Zhisong\u2019s reputation is ruined, he won\u2019t even be able to take the scholar exam!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Old lady Wang was stunned at first but then screamed, \u201cI dare him!\u201d\u201cSee if he dares!\u201d Zhao Lizheng really wished he could slap some sense into this stupid woman. The village\u2019s child student\u2026 Zhao Lizheng no longer cared about old lady Wang and hurriedly asked his eldest son Zhao Yuande to chase.Zhao Lizheng\u2019s action rattled fearless old lady Wang. \u201cHe, he really dared to go to the county school and discredit Zhisong\u2019s reputation?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, keep messing around!\u201d Zhao Lizheng ignored old lady Wang and shouted to Wang Tianyan, who was still confused about the whole situation, \u201cYou and Yuande go after him! If this goes badly, Zhisong\u2019s future will be ruined!\u201d Wang Tianyan looked foolishly at Zhao Lizheng and his own mother before running out in a panic.The patriarch said so and so did Zhao Lizheng, finally making old lady Wang feel some fear. She sat on the ground after her legs went weak and then howled. \u201cThis misfortune star!\u201d How can such a misfortune star marry into my Wang family!\u201dZhao Lizheng scolded her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of crying now?! If you hadn\u2019t made such a fuss, there would be no such thing! Shijing is also your son and the eldest one! He didn\u2019t take a single grain of rice from your family, but you are still asking him for money! Is there such a mother as you?! After all, this is your fault!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 28": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fierce \u201cHusband\u201dCH 14.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 14.2Books and Five Classics that Shao Yunan had known since childhood, let alone Tang and Song dynasties poetry. History was different here, so historic figures and classics were naturally also different. Many classic phrases that modern people were familiar with were very rare to hear here.The phrase \u201cpity the world\u2019s parents\u201d came from the Empress Dowager Cixi, which the people of the Great State of Yan certainly did not hear. It was this phrase that made the gatekeeper drop his guard and even show some appreciation for Shao Yunan. On the way there, Shao Yunan asked the guard some questions and\u00a0 learned that his surname was Zhuang. When they arrived outside the classroom, Shao Yunan already called the other\u00a0 party \u2018Uncle Zhuang\u2019 and the other party called him \u2018Brother An.\u2019Stopping, Uncle Zhuang pointed to a big room in front of him and said, \u201cThis is it.\u201d Although the day was bright, the windows of the classroom were propped up. Shao Yunan pretended to see Wang Zhisong and took a few steps closer. Seeing that he was almost at the door, Uncle Zhuang hurriedly shouted in a low voice, \u201cBrother An, don\u2019t go any closer.\u201dThe door of the classroom was also open, so Shao Yunan could see that the master was also there. After listening for a while, he understood that the teacher seemed to be talking about an essay (understood as a modern composition) written by a certain student, so he just turned his head and bowed apologetically to Uncle Zhuang. \u201cUncle Zhuang, I am very sorry that I lied to you but I came here to look for the teacher.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dBefore waiting for Uncle Zhuang to respond, Shao Yunan strode inside amidst Uncle Zhuang\u2019s shocked expression. The students inside the classroom noticed an unexpected guest at the door, while the teacher also stopped his lecture.The teacher put down the essay in his hand and turned his head, frowning. \u201cWho are you? Why did you come into the classroom?\u201dUncle Zhuang ran forward with a jolt to drag Shao Yunan away, but Shao Yunan already entered the classroom with big steps, saluted with his hands, and bowed to the forty-ish year old teacher sitting in classroom before saying in a loud voice without condescension, \u201cTeacher, I came here to see you. As the saying goes, \u2018It is difficult for an honest official to judge a family\u2019s affairs,\u2019 so I can only ask you to judge this family\u2019s matters.\u201dThere was an immediate uproar in the classroom. Wang Zhisong, who sat in the middle of the third row, had never seen Shao Yunan before, so he just assumed that a reckless man had come in and stared at him with both curiosity and disgust on his face. To barge into the classroom like this was simply lawless.Standing outside the door, uncle Zhuang who didn\u2019t dare to come in just said hurriedly, \u201cTeacher Chen, this brother said he was here to\u2026\u201cTeacher Chen just raised his hand to stop uncle Zhuang\u2019s words and said to Shao Yunan, \u201cSince this is a family matter, even if it is difficult for honest officials to make a decision, you should go to your elders or clan elders. What kind of matter makes you have to come here and regard this county school as your ancestral hall?\u201d Although he was very surprised by Shao Yunan\u2019s words, teacher Chen was still very upset. Anyone who became a teacher disliked unreasonable and reckless people.But Shao Yunan was not afraid as he straightened his back and said, \u201cIf it were any other family matter, I would have asked the elders of my clan to judge. But for the family matter I came to see you about, I either have to go to the court or come to you. Because the most important party in this family matter is sitting in this classroom, as one of your students.\u201d\u201cWow!\u201d The classroom became even more noisy. Teacher Chen picked up the paperweight and put it down, making the classroom instantly quiet, but there was a strong sense of gossip on everyone\u2019s face.At this time, the teachers and students in the classroom next door also heard something unusual. Teacher Guan from that classroom came out and asked in a loud voice, \u201cBrother Chen, what\u2019s the matter? Why is there so much noise?\u201dShao Yunan turned around and bowed to another scholar of similar age to teacher Chen, who had just come to the door, but did not speak. Teacher Chen unhappily said, \u201cThis man said \u2018It is difficult for an honest official to judge a family\u2019s affairs\u2019.\u201d\u201cIt is difficult for an honest official to judge a family\u2019s affairs\u2026\u201d Teacher Guan couldn\u2019t help looking at Shao Yunan a little more carefully. He saw that although this man was dressed in a simple coarse\u00a0 sackcloth, he looked magnanimous and proud, without a trace of vulgarity. In addition, this person\u2019s red lips and white teeth give him an exquisite appearance coupled with bright eyes, and being able to say a sentence he had never heard before made him really curious.Teacher Guan couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cIf that is so, then he might be worth listening to.\u201dWith teacher Guan giving a stage, teacher Chen\u2019s expression eased down. In fact, if Shao Yunan hadn\u2019t spoken in an extraordinary way and his words did not have the dignity of a scholar, teacher Chen would already have had Shao Yunan expelled and charged him at the Yamen with disturbing the county school.\u201cThank you both very much, teachers.\u201d Shao Yunan bowed to the two teachers again and thanked them before straightening his back.Wang Shijing drove the ox cart to the county town in a hurry. When he arrived at the livestock depository and saw the small donkey, Wang Shijing\u2019s head started to hurt. Sun Erjiang was shocked. \u201cIsn\u2019t this the donkey of Erguzi\u2019s family? Little sister-in-law didn\u2019t really go to the county school, did he?\u201d Sun Erjiang and Wang Xing were both two years younger than Wang Shijing, so even though they were older than Shao Yunan, they still had to call him their little sister-in-law.\u201cLet\u2019s go and find him!\u201d Wang Shijing hurriedly paid some money and then took Sun Erjiang and Wang Xing to run toward the county school. The three of them, breathlessly ran to the county school\u2019s gate but were stopped before going in.\u201cUgh, what kind of people are you to just barge in? Do you know where this place is?\u201d Wang Shijing asked anxiously, \u201cUncle, was there a 15-16 years old little brother here in gray clothes before? He is my wife.\u201d The man said, \u201cYes. He said he was asked by his mother-in-law to send some money to a newly enrolled boy student. Why?\u201dAah! He really went in! Wang Xing and Sun Erjiang looked at Wang Shijing in panic. Wang Shijing suppressed his anxiety and quickly asked, \u201cUncle, my wife was in a hurry and didn\u2019t bring enough money, so I want to send it over. After giving money we will leave.\u201dThe man looked suspiciously at the three men dressed as farmers with muddy legs and couldn\u2019t quite believe that\u00a0 this one-eyed, disfigured man could be the husband of that handsome young man.The man just said, \u201cThat little brother spoke well, just like a scholar, so how could he be your wife?\u201d He looked up and down at Wang Shijing. \u201cThis is a county school, not a place that anyone can just enter.\u201d It was not said without meaning that he didn\u2019t look worthy of Shao Yunan at all.Wang Shijing clenched his fist and said patiently, \u201cThat\u2019s really my wife who just passed by.\u201d He took out the money bag from his arm. \u201cHe left in such a hurry that he took the wrong money bag so I was in a hurry to catch up with him.\u201dWang Xing and Sun Erjiang said boldly, \u201cUncle, that person is really his wife.\u201dThe gatekeeper still didn\u2019t believe it, so he pretended no to see the anxiety on the faces of the people before him. \u201cThis is not a place that can be entered casually. When your wife comes out, you can ask him to send it again. In half an hour, school will be over, so wait at the door.\u201d With that, the man pushed Wang Shijing and the others outside. Wang Shijing looked inside anxiously, but he couldn\u2019t really break in. He was not afraid of involving Wang Zhisong, but he didn\u2019t know Shao Yunan\u2019s specific situation. He was afraid of implicating Shao Yunan even more.The three people were pushed out and Wang Shijing broke out in a sweat. Wang Xing anxiously asked, \u201cBrother Shijing, what should we do?! Little sister-in-law will not be arrested, right?Wang Shijing clenched his fist and told Wang Xing the same thing he told himself, \u201cYunan has many novel ideas, so he must have a way to protect himself. If he doesn\u2019t come out when the school ends, I\u2019ll break in and find him.\u201d\u201cHow can you do that? You will be arrested if you break into the county school.\u201d Wang Xing and Sun Erjiang hurriedly advised. Wang Shijing was very anxious. \u201cI can\u2019t wait!\u201dBefore Wang Shijing\u2019s group arrived, teacher Guan sat down next to teacher Chen intending to listen to the problem together. Shao Yunan did not immediately say what family affair it was, but spoke to uncle Zhuang who sent him in. \u201cUncle Zhuang, although this younger generation is really helpless, it is this younger generation\u2019s fault for deceiving you. I want to apologize to you once more. If I hadn\u2019t been forced to this point, this junior would not have chosen this way. I hope you will be able to bear with me.\u201d After saying that, he made another deep bow.The two teachers planned to cut right into this family affair, so uncle Zhuang, who was not blamed by anyone, only waved his hand and said with a wry smile, \u201cYou are already like this, so how could I, an elder, not comply? You\u2019d better tell the two teachers what is going on.\u201d Shao Yunan made another bow and turned to the two teachers. At this time, someone outside suddenly shouted, \u201cThe Dean has come!\u201dAt this call, teachers Chen and Guan immediately turned around and walked out, while the students in the classroom also all stood up. Uncle Zhuang just gave Shao Yunan a \u2018Just be lucky\u2019 look before hurriedly looking towards the Dean\u2019s figure. After this, the students from teacher Guan\u2019s class also left the classroom one after another. Shao Yunan also decided to leave the classroom.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing them, teachers Chen and Guan quickly took two steps forwards and saluted. \u201cYour Excellency, Dean.\u201dYour Excellency? Shao Yunan looked at the old man first and then turned his gaze to the young man. It couldn\u2019t be a county master here, is it? When the two teachers called like this, the students who were just talking around them also hurriedly corrected their posture. While the students in teacher Chen\u2019s class all hurriedly came out and called in unison, \u201cDean.\u201dIt seems that the students also did not know this young master. In a moment, Shao Yunan had a plan in mind and stepped forward, just behind the two teachers and also greeted, \u201cYour Excellency, Dean.\u201dThe old man frowned slightly. \u201cCan you two teachers explain? Why are you all gathered here? It\u2019s not yet time to end the class. Even the county magistrate has been alarmed.\u201d With that, he looked at Shao Yunan, waiting for an explanation. Upon hearing this, the students hurriedly called in unison, \u201cMy lord!\u201dThe young man said, \u201cNo need to be polite. What happened? The county school is a place for students to study and prepare for their exams. Did someone come here to cause trouble?\u201d After saying that, he looked at Shao Yunan.Shao Yunan did not back down. This was not his home court where the noisy guest can win over the master. Later he will have time to win over the master, but now as expected, it was teacher Chen who spoke first, pointing to Shao Yunan. \u201cYour Excellency, Dean. This person said that he had a family matter to be judged by the teacher of the county school. The person involved in that family matter is in my classroom.\u201dThe young man raised his eyebrows and said sternly, \u201cHow did this family matter find its way to the teachers of the county school? What is your clan and what is your name?\u201d Shao Yunan stepped forward and stood right next to the two teachers, looking very calmly at the young man as he saluted.\u201cCounty magistrate, one of the reasons why I came to this county school is that the most important person in this whole thing is a school student. He doesn\u2019t know me, so I won\u2019t mention my surname and my name for the time being, so that I will not be able to tell the whole matter clearly. Secondly, I also told the two teachers earlier, since ancient times, it is difficult for an honest official to judge a family\u2019s affairs, while there were also partial people in the family. If I had another place to address my grievances, how could I dare come to the most reasonable teachers to judge. I know I have been reckless, but since you are here and so is the Dean, why don\u2019t you hear me out first before you convict me?\u201dIn the face of the county magistrate, Shao Yunan did not address himself with a humble address, but called himself \u2018I\u2019. He was gambling. He was betting that the young magistrate was a reasonable person and would be intrigued by his words.The county magistrate looked at Shao Yunan for some time, then looked at the Dean before saying, \u201cWhether the clan has partial people, I will not comment, but your phrase \u2018It is difficult for an honest official to judge a family\u2019s affairs\u2019 is somewhat true. Seeing that you are not an ignorant person, this official will give you this opportunity. If what you said is true and this matter needs to be judged by the teachers, this official will exempt you from the crime of trespassing into the county school. If you exaggerated the matter just to mess around, don\u2019t blame this official for punishing you for your crimes.\u201d\u201cThank you, Your Excellency.\u201d Shao Yunan bowed respectfully. The county magistrate and the Dean sat directly next to the stone in the courtyard, then the county magistrate told the two teachers to sit as well. Seeing this, all the students stood up very self-consciously, without any intention of returning to the classroom. Among these students, Wang Zhisong who still didn\u2019t know how the situation would develop also stood among the lively crowd. All 23 students from the two classes of the county schools were present. There were four people sitting in front of Shao Yunan and behind him was a group of students watching the fun.In this situation, Shao Yunan\u2019s face remained unchanged. It was not much different from his thesis defense. He turned to the two teachers, Chen and Guan. \u201cTwo teachers, this young generation would like to ask, what is a master and what is a teacher?\u201dHmm? Didn\u2019t he want to talk about his family affairs? What was he doing asking this? The two teachers looked at Shao Yunan puzzlingly, the county magistrate and Dean\u2019s expression also sank, but Shao Yunan still looked like he was waiting for an answer.Teacher Chen looked at teacher Guan who spoke first. \u201cOf course, the teacher\u2019s purpose is to teach his students and select talents for the imperial court.\u201dShao Yunan shook his head and said, \u201cIn this younger generation\u2019s opinion, a teacher is \u2018preaching\u2019, \u2018teaching\u2019, and \u2018solving doubts\u2019 as well. Preaching and teaching. Teaching moral ideas such as etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame to these so-called people who become talents. Preaching is the prerequisite for success. Teaching is to teach all kinds of skills and knowledge handed down by our ancestors, which is the only way to become a talented person. While \u2018solving doubts\u2019 is to solve the students\u2019 difficulties and confusion, so that they will not take a detour, wrong path, or go astray. As for the selection of talents for the imperial court, it is just a matter of pushing the boat along with the river\u2026 a matter of course. I don\u2019t know if this is just a biased understanding of this junior.\u201dWhen he finished his words, the expressions of the people present changed, especially the magistrate, the Dean, and the two teachers. When he finished, the Dean was the first to murmur, \u201cPreaching, teaching, and solving doubts\u2026 the true path of a teacher\u2026\u201d He clapped his hands and said, \u201cCorrect solution! Correct solution!\u201dThe surrounding students were also amazed. The teachers have not taught them these principles.

How could something like this be said by a person from a peasant family? He opened his mouth and asked, \u201cWhere did you hear that?\u201dShao Yunan said frankly (shamelessly), \u201cI think so myself.\u201d\u201cDid you think of it yourself?!\u201d There was a cry of surprise all around.\u201cI thought of it myself.\u201d\u00a0 A certain person\u2019s face was not red, even his ears did not blush a little.At the entrance of the county school, Wang Shijing, Wang Xing, and Sun Erjiang waited anxiously. Wang Shijing tried to barge in several times but was stopped. Then the other party directly said that if he barged in again, he would be sent to the Yamen. Wang Xing and Sun Erjiang desperately dragged Wang Shijing away to prevent him from going in. While the three were anxiously waiting for Shao Yunan to come out, Wang Shiping, Wang Tianyan, and Zhao Yuande arrived.As soon as they saw Wang Shijing, Wang Shuping and Zhao Yuande hurriedly asked, \u201cWhere is your wife?\u201dWang Shijing just stared at Wang Tianyan and said nothing. It was Wang Xing who replied worriedly, \u201cMy little sister-in-law has gone in.\u201d\u201cWhat?! You didn\u2019t stop him?!\u201d Wang Shuping and Zhao Yuande\u2019s expressions changed. Shao Yunan really went in. This was the county town school! In case of trouble, not to mention Wang Zhisong, the whole Xiushui village might be affected.Wang Tianyan opened his mouth and shouted, \u201cBig brother! What did your wife do?! Why didn\u2019t you stop him?!\u201d Wang Shijing stood up and stepped forward. His face twisted as he gritted his teeth. \u201cThis is your sister-in-law! Why didn\u2019t I stop him? Why didn\u2019t you think of how you were killing me when you asked me for money?\u201dWang Shijing was more than a head taller than Wang Tianyan. He had also killed people on the battlefield and had come out of the pile of the dead. As soon as he unleashed his aura, Wang Tianyan immediately sat down on the ground with weak legs, unable to say a word. Not to mention Wang Tianyan, the others were also scared and could not say a word.Wang Shijing stared at Wang Tianyan like death himself and said word by word, \u201cI can\u2019t do anything about it, but if anything happens to Yunan, I want you and your wife to pay for it with your life! Wang Tianyan, I, Wang Shijing, have already separated. From now on, I have no parents, no brothers or sisters.\u00a0 Even if I need to leave Xiushui Village with my wife and children, I will never let you bully my wife and children!\u201d\u201cBrother Shijing!\u201d\u201cCalm down Shijing.\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s words scared the four people, in addition to Wang Tianyan they also brought others back to their senses. While Wang Tianyan was already scared to the point of pissing his pants. Wang Shijing arms were grasped by Wang Xing and Sun Erjiang as he walked to the bottom of the wall and squatted down with his back against the wall, emitting a dark aura. Zhao Yuande took a breath, walked over and said, \u201cThis matter will be handled impartially by my father and the Wang patriarch. Don\u2019t be angry.\u201dWang Shuping was there so Zhao Yuande\u2019s words were actually for Wang Shuping to hear. However, Wang Shijing did not intend to go along with them and said directly, \u201cThese are not angry words, but something I said from the bottom of my heart.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense!\u201d Using filial piety for fighting, how can you casually say that you won\u2019t recognize your parents? Zhao Yuande patted Wang Shijing trying to calm him down. Wang Shiping also went over, squatting on Wang Shijing\u2019s other side he said, \u201cIn this matter it was aunt that was wrong. Try to calm down. When your wife comes out, we will go back to the village and my father will certainly give you justice.\u201dWang Shijing, filled with dark thoughts, did not pay any attention to their persuasion. If he could get justice, he would have gotten it a long time ago and would not wait until now. Wang Xing and Sun Erjiang also grimaced in their hearts.At this moment, a voice came, \u201cArgh! You! It\u2019s you! Your wife actually did not come to deliver the money at all, he actually came to get judgment from the master!\u201d The gatekeeper who stopped Wang Shijing before, ran down the stairs and shouted to Wang Shijing. \u201cHe also disturbed the county magistrate and the Dean! This guy really has guts!\u201dWang Shijing stood up, jumped up the steps, pushed the man away, and rushed into the county town school. The man shouted from behind, \u201cCome back! Come back!\u201dWang Shijing rushed in, so Wang Xing and Sun Erjiang gritting their teeth also followed behind him. Zhao Yuande caught up with the gatekeeper and said, \u201cWe are all from the same village, let us in. We definitely won\u2019t make trouble!\u201dSeveral people ran into the courtyard at the same time, but seeing the courtyard situation, they hurriedly stopped and looked at the one who was circled in the middle. Shao Yunan calmly waited for the reply from two masters.\u201cThen the late generation asks again about preaching. Will preaching teach a despicable way?\u201d All four people sitting did not look worried. \u201cTeaching, are you teaching about taking away other people\u2019s family wealth?\u201dWithout giving everyone a chance to ask questions, Shao Yunan asked again, \u201cThen solve my confusion, is the solution of my dilemma forcing people to death?\u201dWang Shijing, who was still thinking about how to save Shao Yunan, froze. Wang Xing, Sun Erjiang, Zhao Yuande, and Wang Shuping, who scratched their ears and cheeks also froze. The gatekeeper who caught up with them swallowed his shout in time, so no one noticed them coming in. They were all focused on this nameless person who came for judgment.The county magistrate said coldly, \u201cSince you have already made it clear what a teacher is, why do you ask this question? This is an insult to the Dean and the two teachers here, as well as all the teachers in the Great State of Yan.\u201dShao Yunan looked straight at the county magistrate and said strongly, \u201cYes, I have stated what the teacher is, but among these students in the classroom of the Dean and the two teachers there is a scholar who is despicable, shameless, and ruthless. He allowed his family to take away others\u2019 money and watched coldly as his family forced them into desperation. He even forced his own eldest brother, sister-in-law, and their two children.\u201d\u201cWow!\u201dThe whole room was in an uproar. The expressions of the county magistrate, Dean, and two teachers instantly froze. Among the students gathered around, there was a person whose heart thumped as he stared at Shao Yunan in panic. Shao Yunan let go of all the aura he had been suppressing and shouted sternly. \u201cThat person has been reading virtuous books since childhood and is full of the words of virtue, but all the things he did were selfish and self-serving! But such a person has been praised by teachers for his talent and intelligence and having a bright future.\u201d\u201cEveryone says that \u2018ugliness of the family should not be made public,\u2019 but today, in order to let the two masters judge and keep my husband alive, I have to ask all of you here whether filial piety can be done without kindness and whether merit can offset morality. I will speak publicly about my family affairs.\u201d\u201cMy name is Shao Yunan and I am from Shaojia Village.\u201d A certain man\u2019s face instantly became white, as he backed out a step, hitting a fellow student.\u201cWhen I was fourteen years old, the son of a certain family had a strange disease and they insisted on finding a person with the same eight characters to eliminate the evil. Their family found my parents and bought my marriage with 50 taels of silver. I am an adopted son whose adoptive parents are greedy for money, so despite my wishes and regardless of the lack of matchmaking, because the parent\u2019s orders can\u2019t be disobeyed I become engaged. I had no choice but to repay their kindness for raising me, even if I didn\u2019t want to, I still obeyed my parents\u2019 orders.\u201d\u201cBut who would have thought that two years later, when the man became a child student his family would withdraw the marriage. My parents were unwilling to do so, and I was forced by both sides to jump into the river and kill myself.\u201d\u201cHiss -\u201d many students sighed, while others whispered whether they knew who the other person was.\u00a0 Someone with shrunken shoulders and tightly clenched lips wanted to sneak away but there were people all around, so he was left standing there in a dilemma. The people sitting around heard that Shao Yunan wanted to commit suicide so their expressions become a bit more gloomy. Such a thing was not uncommon, but they were often unable to do anything about it.Shao Yunan took a deep breath as his voice became hoarse. \u201cBecause I almost died, each side took a step back. But the marriage was still held. Not to that person, but to his elder brother. On the wedding day, I was put on a sedan chair after drinking drugged porridge. Perhaps God had mercy on me, although my husband is a widower and had a son and a daughter already, he is very kind to me and his two children are also very sensible. This marriage was a good match for me.\u201dA man looked at Shao Yunan through the crowd with red eyes, his whole body tense. His eyes were not sad, but were filled with extreme resentment and self-blame. When Shao Yunan said that the marriage was a good match, he could no longer stay put and rushed over, but was caught by four people.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 31": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fierce \u201cHusband\u201dCH 16.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16.1\u201cI am here today, not for me, but for my husband and for the two young children in my family!\u201d Shao Yunan\u2019s words were unexpected, because everyone thought he had come to seek justice for himself.\u201cMy husband is the eldest son of the family, but was forced to leave for mandatory labor within two months of his marriage and he was gone for two years. Today, I\u2019m going to risk my unfilial life to seek justice for my husband and for his two poor children. My mother-in-law took 50 taels of silver to buy the life of her youngest son, but she could not afford to let her eldest son, who was newly married to accompany his pregnant wife. After two years of mandatory labor my husband came back sick and wounded but in less than two years he was sent to military service again.\u201d\u201cAccording to the law of our dynasty, those who already served for more than one year are exempted from military service, but my mother-in-law forced my husband to join the army for her second son\u2019s sake. She even went to the Yamen and lied about my husband\u2019s willingness to join the army. It was not until the Yamen sent someone to take my husband away, that he learned that his own mother could not bear the suffering of her second son, but refused to spend more money, so she pushed him out of the house again.\u201d\u201cThis time he was away for three years. During these three years my husband\u2019s ex-wife left home because she couldn\u2019t stand the abuse of her mother-in-law and siblings, while my husband lost an eye and half of his face. But within two days of his return, he was forced by his mother to get married again to clean up his younger brother\u2019s mess. My husband could not stand it anymore and proposed separation from his family for his contest of this marriage. Afterwards his mother signed the deed of separation in front of the clan patriarch and other village patriarchs. But I had just entered his house for two days when my mother-in-law started forcing my husband to divorce me, because my husband refused to hand over my dowry which angered his mother. For me, my husband wrote down the deed of separation again and returned all the proceeds from the separation, including every grain of rice or bundle of firewood, in exchange for his freedom to stay with me.\u201dShao Yunan felt shameless when he said this.\u201cHowever, this deed was invalid. My husband was left without a roof over his head, so he now lives in a house borrowed from kind hearted villagers, so my family is really in need. I had no choice but to sell the three stones that my husband gave me on the day of our wedding. Fortunately the owner of the Butterfly Pavilion took a fancy to them and paid for them. But as a result, when my mother-in-law learned about it, she came with my second brother and sister-in-law to ask for them, saying that the stones were my husband\u2019s belongings before separation and had to be returned to the family. She also wanted to open the ancestral hall and convict my husband of unfiliality.\u201d\u201cI would like to ask this child student of my husband\u2019s family\u2026 When your elder brother was treated like this by his family, where were the virtuous books you read? When your sister-in-law was bullied by your brother and sister-in-law, where were the virtuous books you read? When your young nephew had to get up before dawn to cook for your family, where were the virtuous books you read? When your niece who was only 2 or 3 years old had to do the laundry for your family in the winter, where were the virtuous books you read? Where were the virtuous books you read when your young niece and nephew didn\u2019t have enough to eat or wear, while you had fish and meat to eat?!\u201d\u201cWhere were the virtuous books you read when you pushed the marriage you didn\u2019t want on your elder brother?\u00a0 Where were the virtuous books you read when you hid in the county town, meeting with your classmates when your elder brother got married? When your family asked your elder brother for money on the grounds that you needed it for study, where were the virtuous books you read? When your family threatened the head of the village and the patriarch of the clan to force your elder brother to leave the house because of your capacity as a child student, don\u2019t tell me you weren\u2019t at home and didn\u2019t even know about it!\u201d\u201cIn my opinion the virtuous books you read were completely wasted on you! Don\u2019t say that your parents\u2019 orders can\u2019t be disobeyed and filial piety is more important than heaven! You have attended reading lessons since the age of five and private school since the age of 8, so you have been here for ten years. Do you really not know that the treatment your eldest brother received was wrong and so was bullying your niece and nephew? Don\u2019t you know that it is unkind and unjust to push your unwanted marriage to your brother? Don\u2019t you also know that you should at least be present for your elder brother\u2019s wedding?\u201d\u201cYou are just a child student, but you are so indifferent, heartless, and totally ignore the feelings of brotherly love by letting your family do what they do. As long as you persuade and discipline a little and set an example to respect your brother and sister-in-law, treat your nephew and niece well, your\u00a0 nephew and niece wouldn\u2019t be motherless since they were young. How could you be so cold towards your eldest brother?\u201d\u201cIf a man like you really passes the exam and becomes a government official, how can you treat the people well and think for their sake? You would definitely become a corrupt official who is unkind to the people! You had a full decade to remedy your mistakes, but as result you only became worse! Why does your family dare to disregard the laws of the court and the deed of separation? Why do you dare to force the patriarch to open the ancestral hall? Isn\u2019t it because you are a child student and they believe that you have a future as a scholar? If all the scholars were like you, what hope would there be for our dynasty?\u201d\u201cIt is the fourth day since I married your elder brother. So Wang Zhisong, I ask you, do you recognize me?\u201d\u201cWow\u2013\u201dThe whole audience was shocked. As a new child student this year, Wang Zhisong was recognized by everyone. Shao Yunan\u2019s last bomb fell and everyone\u2019s eyes were fixed on the panicked Wang Zhisong, as everyone around him quickly backed away. In an instant Wang Zhisong\u2019s surroundings were empty. The county magistrate and the Dean\u2019s face were set in stone, while the two teachers wrinkled their browns in cold expressions. At this time, all four people looked at Wang Zhisong and the Dean even shook his head.Shao Yunan took a few steps to Wang Zhisong, whose face was pale and trembling, and asked loudly, \u201cWang Zhisong! My brother-in-law, do you or do you not recognize me?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201dWang Zhisong was usually arrogant, but he was after all only a 15-year-old boy who had not yet seen much of the world. In the village everyone praised him. At home everyone spoiled him, so how could he cope with such a scene? Shao Yunan\u2019s previous words have already made him panic, but now in the face of Shao Yunan\u2019s questioning, he was not able to respond and was very confused.Shao Yunan saw Wang Shijing at this time. Wang Shijing\u2019s height also made him stand out here. He also saw Wang Shijing\u2019s expression and for a moment, his heart was aching. Shao Yunan walked towards Wang Shijing step by step. The county magistrate, Dean, and the two teachers all followed his movement and noticed a few people that looked out of the place. Especially the tall man with a black eye patch and half of his face destroyed. The county magistrate stood up, so the Dean and the two teachers also stood up immediately, all of them turning in the same direction.People along the way voluntarily made way for Shao Yunan. Without any sound, Shao Yunan walked up to Wang Shijing and grabbed his fist, breaking open his fingers before holding his hand, then he titled his head. \u201cWang Shijing, your parents don\u2019t love you; your brothers bully you. In the future, I will love you and little Qing and Nizi will be yours and my children.\u201dWang Shijing forcefully hugged Shao Yunan with his empty hand, his voice hoarse. \u201cWife, I have made you suffer.\u201dLetting go of Wang Shijing\u2019s hand, Shao Yunan vigorously embraced him with both hands. He embraced a man who suffered too much in his life. At this moment, Shao Yunan had no other thought in his head except just wanting to hug this man.\u201cYour Excellency, do you think this family affair can be concluded?\u201d Everyone looked at the two people who were embracing each other, almost sighing so they made some noise.As soon as the Dean spoke, Shao Yunan broke free from Wang Shijing\u2019s arms and walked towards them, still holding Wang Shijing\u2019s hand. Wang Shijing was about to kneel and salute the county magistrate, afraid that the county magistrate would want to punish Shao Yunan. But the county magistrate just reached out to stop him and said gently, \u201cYour wife asked for justice for you, but the official still doesn\u2019t know your name.\u201dWang Shijing looked at Shao Yunan first before replying, \u201cI am Wang Shijing. My wife\u2019s surname is Shao and his name is Yunan. He did it for me, so please don\u2019t blame him for going to the county school. All reprimands and punishments should be borne by me alone.\u201d The county magistrate waved his hand and smiled lightly, \u201cThis is the county school, so you need to ask the Dean if he wants to reprimand you.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Teacher Guan didn\u2019t answer since Shao Yunan originally wasn\u2019t looking for him. But teacher Chen said humbly, \u201cI wish there were more people like Brother Shao to \u2018trespass\u2019 into the county school. What I have heard today is like an enlightening experience, which is really a big blessing for me.\u201d Teacher Guan also nodded his head in agreement. \u201cIndeed.\u201dThe Dean smiled and said to Wang Shijing, \u201cIf you can have such a wife, you should cherish him.\u201d What Wang Shijing was so worried about was taken care of very gently by the three people. Immediately afterwards, the Dean\u2019s expression became stern as he asked Wang Shijing, \u201cIs what your wife said true?\u201dWang Shijing did not answer directly, saying only: \u201cI have no regrets about my family. I already have a deed of separation written that I am no longer related to my family, so the Wang family\u2019s honor and disgrace have nothing to do with me. The deed was written in three copies, one copy each for Zhao Lizheng, my former family, and me. Now, I just want to live with Shao Yunan in peace and raise my two children. The stones were my gift to Yunan, so the proceedings should also belong to Yunan.\u201dIf Wang Shijing, as a Chinese son and brother, directly said that his parents and younger brothers were wrong, even if he was reasonable, it would be easy for people to feel resentful. The psychology of scholars was also subtle. Answering in this way, not only made people believe that Shao Yunan did not tell lies, but also won the sympathy of the people.The Dean looked at the county magistrate. \u201cThis family matter, I think you can judge it.\u201d Teacher Chen also immediately said, \u201cThis family matter really should be decided by you. The matter of the eldest son of the Wang family is also a matter of the law of our dynasty.\u201dThe county magistrate nodded, sat down again, and gently patted the stone table beside him with one hand as he spoke. \u201cThen this official will judge this family matter of the Wang family here.\u201d Everyone immediately stood up, even the Dean and the two teachers. This was not a courtroom, so they did not have to kneel to listen to the judgment, but some rules should still be followed.The county magistrate said, \u201cAccording to the law of our dynasty, those who served for more than one year would be exempt from military service. If there is a man in the family who needs to perform military service, they should not be replaced. From the date of the signing of the deed, there is a binding effect. Violators will receive no less than 50 boards and heavy imprisonment for one to three years. Wang Shijing served in mandatory labor for two years, so he shouldn\u2019t be forced to do military service. The mother of the Wang family has broken the law by deceiving the Yamen and forcing her eldest son to serve for her second son. But the mother is not a man, so she can\u2019t be punished.\u00a0 However, the person being replaced should be punished by exile of at least 500 miles for three years.\u201d\u201cIn addition, the mother of the Wang family and the second son, along with the second daughter-in-law of the Wang family came to ask for money after the deed was signed, which is also a violation of the law. There is no law in our dynasty that states all property of the children of the undivided family should be used for public use, so the stones obtained by Wang Shijing should be returned to him. The Wang family mother, second son, and second daughter-in-law demanded money, so they committed the crime of violating the deed and robbery. Both crimes should be punished together. The Wang family mother, second son, and second daughter-in-law each should be sentenced to 50 hits with the board after one year of prison. However, considering mother Wang\u2019s old age, her 50 hits with the board and one year of prison, should be given to her second son and her second\u00a0 daughter-in-law.\u201d\u201cWhen Wang Shijing was forced to serve in the army, Wang Zhisong was young so he should not be punished. Wang Zhisong was also not present when his mother violated the law of the deed. Since he didn\u2019t know, he will not be punished.\u201d The trembling Wang Zhisong immediately sighed a sigh of relief in his heart and immediately took a few steps forward and knelt down, \u201cThank you, Your Excellency.\u201dThe county magistrate did not let Wang Zhisong get up as he continued. \u201cWang Zhisong, this official will not punish you today. But as a scholar, you have not presented the etiquette and filial piety that a scholar should have. You don\u2019t even try to restrain your outrageous mother. It\u2019s not filial piety, but unfilial piety! Your brother has been deceived, your sister-in-law has been humiliated, your nephew and niece have suffered, but your indifference is not worthy of your status as a scholar. As your sister in law said, the virtuous books you read were completely wasted on you. If all child students in this world were like you, the Great State of Yan would be in danger!\u201d Wang Zhisong\u2019s body shook a few times as he sat on the ground.\u201cFor the sake of your youth, you are punished to go home and reflect on yourself. Re-read the virtuous books and re-learn the principles of etiquette and filial piety, as well as fraternal duty. If you change within a year, you can return to the county school. If you still don\u2019t know how to repent after that time, you can go somewhere else to study.\u201d The county magistrate looked at the Dean. \u201cWhat does the Dean think?\u201dThe Dean nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t accept people who violate virtue here. I won\u2019t allow anyone who was taught here to go out and lose my reputation, as well as the face of the scholars of the Great State of Yan.\u201d\u201cYour excellency! Dean!\u201d Wang Zhisong was now afraid. Really afraid, so he burst into tears. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I really didn\u2019t know. Those things were all done by my mother and my second brother and sister-in-law! I really didn\u2019t know! \u201cIt was good that Wang Zhisong didn\u2019t refuse. Refusal would be even more despicable. The most important thing for a scholar was his reputation and face, which was his main virtue. No matter how he was inside, on the surface he should pull his weight on the surface and not let others know his true nature. But Wang Zhisong put all the blame on his mother, brother, and sister-in-law, which was even more shameful, but also confirmed Shao Yunan\u2019s accusations against him. The county magistrate shook his head, full of disappointment. The Dean\u2019s expression also looked extremely bad as he said forcefully, \u201cGo back.\u201d\u201cDean!\u201d Wang Zhisong still wanted to beg for mercy, so he knelt down, but one person knelt down even before him. The county magistrate and the Dean, as well as the other people gathered around, looked puzzled.Wang Shijing gave a kowtow to the county magistrate and said, \u201cMy lord, as a son and a brother, I won\u2019t put guilt on my parents and want to be benevolent to my brothers. Now that I\u2019m back alive and separated I have already returned the kindness of my parents and the brotherhood of my brothers. My wife didn\u2019t come here today to punish them, but to let my mother and brothers acknowledge the deed so we can live our lives freely in the future without any further involvement with them. I sincerely ask you to take back the punishment, it will be my last filial piety and righteousness toward them.\u201dAfter saying that, Wang Shijing gave a kowtow to the county magistrate. Then the county magistrate asked Wang Shijing to get up and looked at Shao Yunan. Shao Yunan did not kneel, but just bowed saying, \u201cI also only ask that in the future, both sides as written in the separation deed will have nothing to do with each other and have no relation.\u201dThe county magistrate pondered and then nodded slightly as he looked at the hopeful Wang Zhisong and finally said, \u201cYou two have mercy and righteousness, but this official cannot decide the case on the basis of friendship. The law is strict and clear, and as a government official of Yongxiu County, this punishment is not only to give justice to the two of you, but also to uphold the strictness of the law for the people of Yongxiu County. If I know there are offenders, but turn a blind eye to them, then in the future, how can I redress the grievances of others and govern Yongxiu County?\u201dWang Zhisong\u2019s body shivered again as the Dean spoke. \u201cYour Excellency, this case involves his mother and brothers, and if we want to investigate further it will also involve the whole Wang family and Zhao Lizheng of Xiushui Village, all of whom knew about this matter but concealed it without reporting it. All of them should be punished according to the law. The law is strict, but your excellency should be impartial. Otherwise, these two would never be able to separate from their clans and Xiushui village. According to the judgment of your excellency, I am afraid that they would have a hard time when they return. Three years have passed and they do not want to pursue this matter any more. So why don\u2019t take into account their feelings and give lighter sentences so that they will not be wronged.\u201dThe county magistrate fell silent as if deep in thought and after a while he nodded. Wang Zhisong\u2019s face was once again full of hope and nervousness as the county magistrate made the final verdict. \u201cI can\u2019t leave this matter without punishment, but since the two of you begged for mercy and the Dean\u2019s words are indeed reasonable, this official will compromise the sentence. Your brother and daughter-in-law will be exempted from exile, it will be changed to 4 months of prison and 50 hits with the board, including the ones on behalf of their mother. This punishment will no longer be changed so there is no need for the two of you to beg for mercy anymore.\u201dThe last sentence of the county magistrate showed that the matter had come to an end. Wang Shijing pursed his lips and bowed. \u201cThank you, Lord.\u201d Shao Yunan also bowed. \u201cThank you, Lord.\u201dAfter the county magistrate\u2019s intuitive sentence, Wang Zhisong wanted to come forward to the Dean. But the Dean just said, \u201cWang Zhisong, due to your young age, his excellency exempted you from punishment, but your virtues don\u2019t match your identity as a child student. You are not separated from your family so it is chilling that you blame your mother, brother, and sister-in-law for your eldest brother\u2019s situation. Because your brother pleaded for you, I will spare you from this one year of reflection, but you still should stay home at least for three months before going back to school. But if your virtues remain the same in the future and your brother and sister-in-law still have to ask your teacher to judge your family affair, then you should go on your own. I hope you can restrain your family\u2019s behavior in the future to not disgrace your name as a child student.\u201d\u201cThank you, sir! Thank you, Dean!\u201d Wang Zhisong kowtowed to show his thanks, lowering his eyes to not show hatred toward Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan.The county magistrate and Dean however, shook their heads again when Wang Zhisong couldn\u2019t see. In the end, Wang Zhisong did not thank his brother and sister-in-law. This person\u2019s character was already evident. Thinking about the conduct of the Wang family, Wang Zhisong not only failed to persuade his family after so many years of studying, but they were afraid that he would hold a grudge in his heart. There were relatively few scholars in the Great State of Yan, but for the county magistrate and the head of the county school, it didn\u2019t matter because such scholars were not needed.The two teachers could see the county magistrate\u2019s and Dean\u2019s mind. Some students who paid attention could also see it, but no one mentioned it to Wang Zhisong. On the contrary, they were all very curious about Shao Yunan. Obviously he was a peasant farmer\u2019s son, so how could he say such amazing things that they had never heard of?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After the Dean announced Wang Zhisong\u2019s departure, Shao Yunan also thought of leaving. The county magistrate looked at the sky and ordered the people who came with him to escort Wang Tianyan and Wang Guo to Xiushui Village to announce the penalty. At this time, Zhao Yuande, the son of Zhao Lizheng and Wang Shuping, the son of the Wang clan patriarch, hurriedly came forward to plead guilty.Although the county magistrate did not mention whether he would investigate the crime of Zhao Lizheng and the Wang clan, Wang Shuping and Zhao Yuande were still scared. The county magistrate was quite polite to the two of them, saying only that when they went back, they should tell their fathers that as family patriarchs, human feelings should also be taken into account, but they could not violate the law. In short, they were also knocked down a peg.Shao Yunan was secretly surprised to hear that the county magistrate seemed to be a little partial to them? Otherwise, with his and Wang Shijing\u2019s identity, it was already rare that the county magistrate was willing to manage this matter, but he not only helped them with his words, he also warned Zhao Lizheng and the Wang clan patriarch through Zhao Yuande and Wang Shuping.Shao Yunan immediately had a plan in mind. After Wang Shuping and Zhao Yuande said that Wang Tianyan was outside the county school, the county magistrate sent someone to catch him. Shao Yunan stepped forward and bowed, \u201cYour Excellency, I have another unkind request.\u201d The county magistrate did not seem to mind Shao Yunan\u2019s self-address and said, \u201cGo ahead.\u201dShao Yunan said, \u201cThis man is innocent, but even innocent men get into trouble because of their wealth.\u201d Another amazing sentence came out. \u201cYour excellency ruled that the stone belongs to Wang Shijing, but now everyone knows we have valuable stones in our possession. Wang Shijing and I are just ordinary people and after this incident, there is no guarantee that there will not be any curiosity about the stone, so I want to hand over the remaining stone to you for safekeeping, so that I can protect my family of four with your excellency\u2019s authority.\u201dWhen Shao Yunan said this, the audience was shocked. Wang Shijing was also stunned, but he pursed his lips tightly and did not say anything. The county magistrate also could not hide his surprise. \u201cI\u2019m afraid this stone is extremely rare, right? I have already made the decision for you, so if anything happens later because of the stone, you can beat the drums to voice your grievances and I will not refuse. It\u2019s just a matter of handing it over to the Yamen officers.\u201dBut Shao Yunan already pulled out the stone directly from his bosom. Amid the surprise of the whole audience, he stepped forward and handed the stone with both his hands. \u201cYour excellency, do you think this stone will not attract the attention of the criminals? My family has two young children and at the beginning, I told the truth about the stones in order to dispel the doubts of the villagers. But who would have thought that even my own family would covet it, so how can I be rest assured about others? The truth is, my family had four stones. I sold three of them to the Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion, and this is the last one. Now that things have come to this point, even if it wasn\u2019t my wish I also have no regrets. But I don\u2019t dare to keep this stone with me anymore, so please grant my rude request. When we are able to keep the stone in the future, I will come to get it.\u201dThe Dean reached out and took the stone from Shao Yunan\u2019s hand, touched it again and again and looked at if from every direction before nodding, \u201cThis stone is almost identical to meat, I was almost wondering why brother Shao took out a piece of meat.\u201dShao Yunan smiled \u2018foolishly\u2019 as the Dean handed the stone to the county magistrate, who looked at it and touched it in amazement. \u201cIt is indeed a rare thing.\u201d Saying that, he handed out the stone again. \u201cYou all come and take a look.\u201dWhen the county magistrate said it, the two teachers and students all gathered around. Even Wang Zhisong couldn\u2019t help coming closer and taking a look. After everyone saw it, the Dean said, \u201cYour excellency, brother Shao\u2019s worries are not unreasonable. Even though the Yongxiu region is relatively safe, for brother Shao to keep this stone, you are the best option. In this old man\u2019s opinion, you might as well take care of this stone for both of them.\u201dThe words of the Dean surprised Shao Yunan again. This Dean also seemed to be a powerful person! It could be said that he was worthy of the title of school Dean, because his moral character was so high!The county magistrate touched the flesh-like stone in his hand and pondered for a long time, before looking at Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing and speaking. \u201cIn that case, this official will keep it for you. In the future, if you two have the ability to protect the stone, this official will return the stone to you. Everyone present today is my witness. During the term of office of this official, I will keep this strange stone for Wang Shijing and his wife, Shao Yunan, safe. This is also guaranteed by the Dean.\u201d\u201cThis old man is willing to vouch for it.\u201d\u201cThank you, Lord! Thank you, Dean!\u201d Shao Yunan thanked them excitedly, with a relaxed smile of \u2018the trouble was finally sent away.\u2019 The Dean pointed at Shao Yunan and laughed, with a helpless smile of \u2018you really had a good idea,\u2019 but also seemed to have a bit of affection for this younger generation.The county magistrate said, \u201cIt\u2019s getting late, so you two can go back.\u201d With that, the county magistrate took out a jade plate from his pocket and handed it to him. \u201cTake this jade plate, so if you have any grievances in the future you can go straight to this official office and beat the drum. This official also exempts you from the rule of thirty boards first, so you don\u2019t need to come to the county school again to disturb the teacher\u2019s lecture.\u201d\u201cThank you, Your Excellency!\u201d Shao Yunan happily took the jade plate, which was an ultimate talisman!Then the county magistrate said, \u201cAlthough the Dean and the two teachers did not punish you, but you disturbing the county school is still true. This official can\u2019t leave it unpunished, otherwise others would learn from this example. You can go home and settle your family matter, but after three days you will need to come to the Yamen to receive your punishment.\u201d\u201cYour excellency!\u201d Wang Shijing became very anxious after hearing him. Shao Yunan gripped Wang Shijing\u2019s hand tightly, letting him know to calm down and just bowed saying, \u201cI know I was wrong, I\u2019ll come to the Yamen in three days to receive punishment.\u201d The county magistrate waved his hand, \u201cYou can go back.\u201d\u201cThank you, Your Excellency! Thank you, Dean! Thank you, two teachers!\u201d After paying his respects, Shao Yunan grasped the hand of the tense-faced Wang Shijing and left together with him. Zhao Yuande and Wang Shuping also went to pay their respects before taking the disheveled and pale Wang Zhisong with them.With all the people gone, the Dean also let the students leave class and the next day\u2019s morning study time was also moved up by half an hour. The students, who had watched a lively show and learned something new, scattered excitedly. When the surroundings quieted down, teacher Chen immediately said to the Dean, \u201cDean, that little brother Shao is a strange person, those words of his, no student have ever heard them before.\u201dTo scholars, novelty was always full of temptation. The Dean\u2019s expression also became quite serious as he stroked his beard in deep thought. \u201cIndeed, I wonder who he studied under.\u201d With Shao Yunan\u2019s performance, no one would doubt that he studied before.The county magistrate also had a thoughtful look on his face as he said, \u201cThis official will send someone to check it out first. When he comes in three days, this official will also ask him for details. The two teachers should also keep quiet for now and discipline their students more.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAlthough the county magistrate was young, he was the favored pupil of the great scholar Weng Lao of the current dynasty and imperial teachers of two emperors. Even an old man like the school Dean had to be respectful in front of him. The Dean and the two teachers were also sure that punishing Shao Yunan was just an excuse to meet him again alone and block gossip.This was also the reason why Shao Yunan let Wang Shijing know, to not be impatient, because he also saw the county magistrate\u2019s true intention. After leaving the county school, Shao Yunan first apologized to Wang Shuping and Zhao Yuande, who also suffered a bit from the disaster. Wang Shuping and Zhao Yuande repeatedly said that there was no need to take it to heart, but also in turn comforted Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan, making Shao Yunan confused. How could their attitude be so friendly?Sure enough, Wang Tianyan was no longer at the gate. Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing were told that Wang Tianyan had been taken away by the Yamen officials. Thinking that the official messengers must have already gone to Xiushui Village, Wang Shuping and Zhao Yuande needed to rush back immediately to explain the situation.

Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing were told that Wang Tianyan had been taken away by the Yamen officials. Thinking that the official messengers must have already gone to Xiushui Village, Wang Shuping and Zhao Yuande needed to rush back immediately to explain the situation. Shao Yunan happened to need to buy some things so he let the two of them back first while he and Wang Shijing bought things before leaving. Wang Xing and Sun Erjiang, who had been quietly following Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing, both said they would go back with Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing.Wang Shijing asked Wang Shuping and Zhao Yuande for help in bringing back the donkey and gave them several copper coins to take care of it. However, the two kept refusing and it was only when Wang Shijing forced them that they gave up. When Wang Shuping and Zhao Yuande left, Shao Yunan breathed heavily and said in a dry voice, \u201cI want to drink water, I\u2019m dying of thirst.\u201dWang Shijing very consciously took Shao Yunan\u2019s hand and held it tight. \u201cThen let\u2019s find a place to drink water.\u201dXiushui Village exploded because of the appearance of a team of officers and soldiers. The atmosphere in the village also became tense, because the people who went to chase Shao Yunan did not come back for a long time. Wang Wenhe, who was waiting for the news at home became tense and his uneasiness only grew bigger and bigger. However, the one they waited for was not Shao Yunan, but these officers and soldiers!Zhao Yuande, Wang Shuping, and Wang Zhisong also followed the officers and soldiers back. Wang Zhisong was sent home by Zhao Yuande and Wang Shuping, while the officers and soldiers followed them to the Wang family house to arrest people. A group of officers and soldiers poured into the Wang family house, where Wang Dali and his only daughter, Wang Zhisong\u2019s sister, Wang Chunxiu, and Wang Tianyan\u2019s son Wang Zaizheng were at home. Seeing such a group of officers and soldiers, Wang Dali was immediately paralyzed with fear. Wang Chunxiu and Wang Zaizheng, as a girl and a child could not even comprehend such a scene, while Wang Zhisong who just returned home, went inside without explaining anything.Wang Shuping and Zhao Yuande were angry when they saw this, but now as representatives of the Wang family, Wang Shuping had the patience to ask where Wang Guo was. As soon as he heard that Wang Guo and old lady Wang were at his home, Wang Shuping\u2019s anger flared up instantly. The officers and soldiers didn\u2019t plan to wait for anyone since it was already dark, so they directly went to Wang Wenhe\u2019s house after knowing their location.The village was in chaos. The villagers all came out of their homes and watched in confusion as the officials rushed first to the Wang family house and then to the Wang clan patriarch\u2019s house. They all could guess who the officials were coming to arrest. Some people guessed whether Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan reported the matter to the Yamen. At the patriarch\u2019s house, they waited impatiently for Wang Shuping to bring Shao Yunan back. Old lady Wang and Wang Guo, who always liked to stir up trouble, were found there by the officials and soldiers.As soon as the leading Yamen officer entered he asked, \u201cWho is Wang Guo?\u201d Wang Guo\u2019s body shivered as she hid behind her mother-in-law, confused. h\\Her first reaction was to hide, not even daring to reply.Wang Wenhe fearfully asked the Yamen officer what had happened and hurriedly asked what happened to his son. But the Yamen officer didn\u2019t have much patience, so he just asked again, \u201cWho is Wang Guo?\u201dAs soon as she felt the Yamen officer\u2019s momentum, old lady Wang\u2019s body went soft while Wang Guo cried out and crawled to hide behind Wang Wenhe. She did not know why the Yamen officer was looking for her, but it was definitely nothing good. This time the Yamen officer didn\u2019t ask anymore and with just his gesture, two soldiers immediately grabbed Wang Guo and dragged her out.\u201cMother! Mother! Patriarch! Patriarch, help! Mother, help!\u201d As soon as Wang Guo was caught, a yellow smelly liquid appeared under her skirt. In the presence of the officials, Wang Shuping was unable to make a sound, so the Yamen officer just asked in a loud voice, \u201cWhere are the Zhao Lizheng and the Wang clan patriarch of Xiushui Village?!\u201dWang Wenhe\u2019s body went limp, so Wang Shuping hurriedly supported him. Wang Wenhe\u2019s wife was so frightened that she quickly knelt down and didn\u2019t even dare to ask what was wrong and hurriedly begged for mercy. Wang Shuping hurriedly asked his wife to pick his mother up. Then Zhao Lizheng came with the help of his second son, Zhao Yuanqing. The Yamen officer immediately announced the county magistrate\u2019s punishment for Wang Dali\u2019s family, as well as a verbal warning to the Wang clan and Zhao Lizheng for concealing it without reporting. Because of Wang Shijing\u2019s plea, the Wang clan head, Zhao Lizheng, Wang Dali, and old lady Wang were exempted from punishment, but Wang Tianyan and Wang Guo had to be punished.After that, the Yamen officer announced the sentence and left with the others. Old lady Wang was so scared by the Yamen officer that she almost peed herself and couldn\u2019t come back to her mind. While Wang Guo squealed like a pig when she was slapped by the officers.An unknown number of villagers watched as Wang Guo was taken away. When the officers and soldiers left, all the villagers gathered at Wang Wenhe\u2019s house to ask what had happened. Only then did Zhao Yuande and Wang Shuping have a chance to tell what happened. Wang Wenhe and Zhao Lizheng became pale and the villagers became even more upset. That Shao Yunan really went to the county school and coincidentally met the county magistrate!Zhao Lizheng and Wang Wenhe did not know that it was against the law for Wang Shijing to be forced to perform military service. But it was also the Wang\u2019s family family business, so as long as Wang Shijing did not make a scene, they would not care much. This was how things were done in the village, human feelings outweighed the law. Wang Shijing was the eldest son of the Wang Dali family and the parents\u2019 order could not be disobeyed. Even the head of the village\u2019s clan patriarch could not interfere much. But how could these two know that if this matter was known by the county magistrate, the county magistrate would want to punish them!As soon as the onlookers heard that if Wang Shijing\u2019s matter was investigated, the whole Wang clan would be convicted of withholding information and not reporting them, some people immediately complained about Wang Dali and old lady Wang. While others said that Wang Shijing was unfilial, how could he let his male wife sue his parents and brothers?But after they heard that Wang Dali\u2019s family could even be exiled for four years for their several crimes they no longer dared to say anything. Wang Shuping and Zhao Yuande said that Wang Tianyan and Wang Guo would receive punishment for several crimes also on behalf of their parents and be imprisoned for five months as well as fifty hits of the boards each. After that, as long as the Wang family no longer committed any more crimes, the county magistrate would no longer pursue the case. Because Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan pleaded for mercy, the county magistrate changed the sentence in order to set an example for the others. Old lady Wang, who was still paralyzed by fear, sat still so the others breathed a sigh of relief.But then, Wang Shuping said that the Dean of the county school asked Wang Zhisong to go home for self-reflection for three months and Wang Wenhe almost stopped breathing, while old lady Wang froze and then opened her mouth to howl again. \u201cAhhhhh! That evil star!\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d With an angry shout, old lady Wang\u2019s curse was pushed back. But it was not Wang Wenhe who shouted angrily, but the extremely dark-faced Zhao Lizheng.Regardless of the fact that the head of the Wang clan was right in front of him, Zhao Lizheng pointed at old lady Wang and scolded, \u201cIf I may say so, today\u2019s trouble was all caused by an unreasonable old woman like you! It was clearly written in this deed that your family has nothing to do with Wang Shijing\u2019s family, but just because you see that Wang Shijing has some money you treat the deed as bullshit! If you hadn\u2019t been so unreasonable, they wouldn\u2019t need to go to the county school. Did you even give birth to Shijing? If you don\u2019t like him so much, why didn\u2019t you strangle him when you gave birth to him? Wang Tianyan and Wang Zhisong are your sons, but Shijing isn\u2019t?\u201d\u201cYou have the money to pay for the medical treatment and betrothal of Wang Zhisong, but not for Wang Shijing\u2019s mandatory labor? You also don\u2019t have money to pay for his military service? If it weren\u2019t for Wang Shijing\u2019s plea, not to mention your family\u2019s Zhisong and Tianyan, all of Xiushui Village would be suffering along with you! Even the Wang clan would not be able to get away! I think your family is in trouble because of you, the wife! Wang Tianyan and his family are no good either! I think they deserve to be taught a lesson!\u201d\u201cGo ahead and make trouble! It\u2019s better to make Wang Tianyan and his wife be locked up in jail for life and make Wang Zhisong lose his status in the examination, then you\u2019ll feel at ease! I\u2019m telling you, in the future if your family is unreasonable, don\u2019t come to me! Whoever caused the trouble should take care of it himself!\u201dZhao Lizheng then turned to Wang Wenhe. \u201cThis time, the county magistrate and the county school teachers all know what happened to our Xiushui Village and your Wang clan. In the future, what face will the people of Xiushui Village have when they go out? Those who don\u2019t know might think that our Xiushui village people are unreasonable. In the future, who would dare to marry a girl from our village or get married to our village men? Would the county school dare to accept students from our village? Let\u2019s not blame Shijing and his family. If someone did not force them to this point, would they do it? Three years ago, you as the patriarch did not say anything, but what should be done now, you should think about it!\u201dThis was the first time Zhao Lizheng said such heavy words to the patriarch of a clan. Turning around, regardless of Wang Wenhe\u2019s attitude, Zhao Lizheng said to the onlookers, \u201cDisperse!\u201dWith his hands behind his back, Zhao Lizheng angrily took his two sons and left. The patriarch usually doesn\u2019t get a chance to meet the county magistrate, but he as village head had to go every year to the Yamen to deal with the county magistrate! This time Xiushui village lost face in front of the county magistrate. Although the county magistrate left them without punishment this time, like he was reminded through his son when he met the county magistrate in the future, how can he behave in front of the heads of other villages? Zhao Lizheng didn\u2019t blame Shao Yunan, but he was angry with the Wang family who caused this, including that tolerant Wang Wenhe.Zhao Lizheng\u2019s words also gave the villagers a sense of crisis. Yes, after such a big trouble, how can people from Xiushui Village be treated as humans after going out? Some people scolded that it was caused by old lady Wang, while others blamed Wang Shijing for not being able to control his wife and some people even blamed Shao Yunan for being restless. But almost every person who was good friends with Wang Shijing was secretly happy, old lady Wang\u2019s family should be treated like this!Once everyone dispersed, old lady Wang began to cry again, begging Wang Wenhe to find a way to save Wang Tianyan and Wang Zhisong. Wang Wenhe\u2019s wife, who couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, pointed at old lady Wang\u2019s nose and cursed. She scolded her hard. Old lady Wang did not dare to scold the clan patriarch\u2019s wife, even if she wanted to. Finally Wang Shuping asked his wife to drag old lady Wang out, saying that she should return home, while he stopped his mother and talked to her.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wang Qing and Wang Nizu were still at his house so he suppressed his anger. No matter what, he could not be angry with the two children. Zhao Yuande, however, dragged his father to his house and asked his brother to follow along. After closing the door, Zhao Yuande immediately whispered, \u201cFather, don\u2019t be angry. Things are not as bad as you think.\u00a0 Wang Shijing\u2019s wife is not a simple person. I think our village will benefit from his glory in the future.\u201d\u201cWhat glory? This is a disgrace!\u201d Zhao Lizheng was so angry that he sat down on the bed and he didn\u2019t even feel hungry, even though it was time for dinner. Zhao Yuanqing became curious. \u201cBrother, tell me what\u2019s going on!\u201dThen Zhao Yuande started to speak. He gave a detailed account of what he had seen and heard after breaking into the county school. As he spoke, the expressions of Zhao Lizheng and Zhao Yuanqing changed again and again, till they finally set in a dumbfounded expression. \u201cThis Shao Yunan, has studied?\u201d Zhao Lizheng\u2019s eyes were rounded.Zhao Yuande replied doubtfully, \u201cHe must have, otherwise how could he say things like this? Neither the Dean of the county school nor the county magistrate seemed to have heard them before. Wang Zhisong was far worse than him. Father, you might not know, but Wang Zhisong was unable to say a word and was scared stiff. He also blamed everything on old lady Wang, saying he didn\u2019t know. It could be seen clearly that the county magistrate and the Dean didn\u2019t like him very much.\u201d\u201cShijing and Yunan asked for mercy, but the county magistrate still punished the Wang family. The most important thing is that the county magistrate promised to take care of the stone for Shao Yunan and gave him a jade plate, saying that if he had any grievances in the future, he could go to the Yamen and beat the drum while exempting him from the rule of thirty board hits. He also asked Shao Yunan to go the Yamen in three days saying that he would be punished, but in my opinion, he would definitely not punish him.\u201d\u201cFather, even if it\u2019s you, you can\u2019t just meet the county magistrate. But Shao Yunan has a jade plate, so how often will he meet the county magistrate in the future? The fact that he can make the Wang family suffer such a loss and make the Dean and the county magistrate judge for him, makes him not a simple person. With such people, we can only become good friends. In my opinion, Wang Zhisong\u2019s reputation is now completely ruined, even if he goes back to school in three months, will the teachers be good to him? Who would dare to make friends with him?\u201d\u201cBut Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan are different. As long as they have the jade plate and the stone isn\u2019t returned, they can meet with the county magistrate. That\u2019s why I said that our village may be able to benefit from them in the future. Father, no matter what the Wang patriarch and the Wang clan people do, you can no longer favor that family! At least our family, our Zhao clan will have to favor Wang Shijing\u2019s wife in the future!\u201dZhao Yuanqing nodded vigorously. \u201cFather, big brother has a point. I don\u2019t like old lady Wang\u2019s family. That Wang Zhisong is capable, but what does it have to do with our Zhao family? He even treated his own elder brother, niece, and nephew like that. How will he help our Zhao family in the future? I think he may not even help the Wang clan. Also, the Wang family are all mean except for Wang Shijing, so it would already be good if they don\u2019t take advantage of our family.\u201dZhao Yuande continued, \u201cFather, you can no longer look at the Wang patriarch\u2019s intention. If he is willing to protect Wang Shijing\u2019s family it\u2019s good, but if he still sees only Wang Zhisong as before, you should make it clear that you want to be partial to Wang Shijing.\u201dZhao Lizheng pondered deeply. He was surprised by Shao Yunan\u2019s performance. The words of his two sons also made sense. Zhao Lizheng was not a fool either. He didn\u2019t do anything about the Wang family\u2019s affairs before, but at that time Wang Shijing had not yet separated. While it was Wang clan\u2019s matter and his surname was Zhao, it was not good to intervene. Now that Wang Shijing has separated and old lady Wang stirred up such big trouble, he really needed to think about it.Half a day later, Zhao Lizheng said, \u201cYuande, go and call the Sun clan patriarch. The two sons of the Sun family are close to Wang Shijing. I want to talk to the Sun clan patriarch and listen to his opinion.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go!\u201d Zhao Yuanqing got up and ran. With only the two of them left, Zhao Yuande said, \u201cFather, I\u2019ll ask Zhao He to get closer to Shao Yunan. They are both male wives, so they can talk easily.\u201dThe relationship between Zhao Yuande and Wang Shijing was very ordinary, if he acted rashly it would be easy to annoy him. But if he let his male wife act, it would be different. After all, Shao Yunan was not from this village so he was not familiar with anyone, so he may have more to say to another male wife. Zhao Lizheng nodded.While Zhao Yuande was talking with his father, Wang Shuping was also advising his own father. What he said was different from Zhao Yuande, but the meaning was very similar. In fact, Wang Shuping didn\u2019t like Wang Zhisong in the first place and today after seeing Wang Zhisong\u2019s performance, he even scoffed. He didn\u2019t think Wang Zhisong could bring any glory to the Wang clan in the future.Wang Shuping also advised his father not to always focus on Wang Zhisong and not to put the hopes of the whole clan on Wang Zhisong alone. It was difficult to say whether Wang Zhisong would be able to take an examination of scholars in the future. It would be better to take advantage of this time to repair the relationship between the Wang clan and Wang Shijing. Wang Shijing was forced to leave home for five years, forced to marry, and also to leave family without anything, so it was impossible to say that he had no grievances against the Wang clan.Wang Shuping advised his father to let Shao Yunan and the two children, Wang Qing and Wang Nizi into the family genealogy. Wang Shijing has not even included Wang Qing in the genealogy since he came back from mandatory labor. Thinking about it now, he was a little afraid that Wang Shijing might hold a grudge from that time.Wang Wenhe was also surprised by Shao Yunan\u2019s performance. Wasn\u2019t Shao Yunan adopted? How could the Shao family let him study? Wang Wenhe fell silent, as his face aged due to worry. He suspected that Wang Zhisong\u2019s future would certainly be affected by this. Wang Wenhe blamed Shao Yunan, as soon as he got married, he caused such big trouble. No matter how you looked at it, Wang Zhisong was the only hope of the Wang clan at present. Wang Shijing was also a member of the Wang clan. Why didn\u2019t Shao Yunan think about the Wang clan at all?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Helplessly Wang Shuping got out, hoping that his father could figure out that Wang Zhisong was really not a reliable person.Wang Shijing, Shao Yunan, and their group come back almost an hour later than Zhao Yuande. When they came back, the ox cart was full of things again. Sun Erjiang and Wang Xing, who were sitting in the cart, were holding clay pots in their arms. As soon as they returned, the village exploded again. Wang Shijing indifferently drove the cart to the doorstep of his home first, unloaded the cart together with Shao Yunan, Wang Xing, and Sun Erjiang, and gave Sun Erjiang and Wang Xing each a packet of snacks as a token of appreciation.Someone had already come to call Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan, both Zhao Lizheng and Wang clan patriarch called them over. After Wang Shijing finished moving his things, he asked Sun Erjiang to help him run to Erguzi\u2019s house to give money for using the donkey. Then leaving Shao Yunan in the house he went out alone.Shao Yunan was still thinking about his tea and mountain goods. He spoke a lot in the afternoon, but didn\u2019t drink any water so his voice became hoarse. He believed that Wang Shijing would not let him suffer, so he felt assured even when he went alone. Wang Shijing did not go to the clan patriarch\u2019s house first, but brought a piece of meat to Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house first. If it wasn\u2019t for Zhao Lizheng\u2019s protection, he and Shao Yunan wouldn\u2019t have a house and he didn\u2019t even know how scared his two children would be.When he arrived at Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house he saw that the Sun clan patriarch was also there. Wang Shijing didn\u2019t avoid them and just handed over the meat and said how grateful he was to Zhao Lizheng for helping them take care of the two children and for troubling Zhao Yuande today. Zhao Lizheng said nothing, while Wang Shijing directly put the meat on the ground after entering the room.Hearing their father\u2019s voice, the two children who had been scared all day ran out. Wang Nizi jumped into her father\u2019s arms and began to cry while Wang Qing had a tense expression and red eyes. Wang Shijing hugged the two children and looked at Zhao He who followed him out and said, \u201cI will need to trouble sister-in-law to send them home first, Yunan is at home.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the trouble?\u201d Zhao He went over and held the two children. \u201cUncle will send you back, let your father stay here to talk.\u201d The two children came out of their father\u2019s arms and left quietly. Since their father and little father came back, they were no longer afraid.The only people left in the house now were, Zhao Lizheng, Sun Zefu, Wang Shijing, and Zhao Yuande, while Zhao Yuanqing took refuge outside. Zhao Lizheng went straight to the point. \u201cShijing, for today\u2019s matter I will not blame you or Yunan. It\u2019s all due to your mother\u2019s nonsense. I will not hide it\u00a0 from you. Your mother\u2019s intention was to make you give her all the money from selling the stones, as well as the rest of the stones, without giving you a way out. In the past, you weren\u2019t separated from your family, so it was difficult for everyone to interfere. But now you have separated and the county magistrate is willing to make decisions for you. From now on, you and Yunan will live a good life and if your mother wants to make any more trouble, you can come to me.\u201dZhao Lizheng\u2019s words made his attitude clear, which made Wang Shijing\u2019s heart very complicated. If it wasn\u2019t for his wife\u2019s drama today, it was hard to say what Zhao Lizheng\u2019s attitude would have been, but no matter what, Zhao Lizheng now sided with him.Patriarch Sun said, \u201cYou should not blame your patriarch. Your Wang clan has a talented student. He is naturally more hopeful towards him. It\u2019s just that he is so focused on helping Wang Zhisong become successful and bring glory to the Wang clan that he forgot to think about whether Wang Zhisong has a good heart. Zhao Yuande told me what happened in the county school and I think your wife\u2019s words are right. If he treats his own brother, niece and nephew like this, how can he benefit the people of Xiushui Village and your Wang clan?\u201dWith a sigh, the Sun patriarch said, \u201cWang Zhisong was punished with three months of reflection at home, so I am afraid that you clan patriarch might hold a grudge. But Wang Shuping is a bright man. You should try to talk with him more often. With him on your side, your clan patriarch will soon figure it out.\u201d Wang Shijing stood up and respectfully saluted. \u201cThank you, Uncle Sun. Thank you, Uncle Zhao.\u201dThe attitude of Zhao Lizheng and the Sun patriarch at least showed that the patriarchs of two of the three big families in the village were now on his side. Wang Shijing thought it probably had to do something with the jade plate\u00a0 Shao Yunan gave to the county magistrate. But with two patriarch\u2019s support, one of whom was Zhao Lizheng, he and Shao Yunan might at least live much better in the village, so even if someone talked about filial piety, it wouldn\u2019t affect them much.Zhao Lizheng said, \u201cGo to your clan patriarch and don\u2019t leave me that piece of meat. Take it.\u201d Wang Shijing said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid the patriarch is not in the mood to eat meat now. I\u2019ll bring him meat in a few days when he is no longer so angry.\u201dHis words amused Zhao Lizheng and patriarch Sun. Wang Shijing, in the hearts of the village people was like his father, Wang Dali\u2026 a sullen gourd. But now that he was able to say such words, Zhao Lizheng and patriarch Sun could clearly see it was due to Shao Yunan\u2019s influence. In fact, they were also betting that Shao Yunan will have a good influence on Wang Shijing, Xiushui Village,ill and their people.Without delaying too long at Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house, Wang Shijing went to Wang Wenhe\u2019s house. As soon as he entered the house and saw the patriarch\u2019s face, Wang Shijing\u2019s heart was clear. Only Wang Wenhe and Wang Shiping were in the Wang family\u2019s hall. Wang Shuping\u2019s attitude was still good, as soon as Wang Shijing came in, Wang Shuping greeted him and asked him to sit down, but Wang Wenhe said, \u201cShijing, what good will it do you if your wife makes a scene like this? I know you are angry with your mother, but you can\u2019t let your wife ruin Wang Zhisong\u2019s reputation like this. He will take the examination for scholars, candidates, and even top students in the future!\u201d\u201cFather!\u201d\u201cStop speaking!\u201dWang Wenhe glared at Wang Shuping, and then looked at Wang Shijing in annoyance. \u201cWith me and Zhao Lizheng, what are you afraid of? Don\u2019t you know that your mother is a troublemaker? Why bother with her? Now, your second brother and sister-in-law are in jail, and Wang Zhisong\u2019s reputation is ruined, you are the eldest brother. Even if you are separated from the family, you are still of the same blood! Are you sure you don\u2019t want your parents and brothers anymore?\u201d\u201cDad!\u201d Wang Shuping was more anxious than Wang Shijing. But Wang Wenhe just shouted angrily. \u201cGet out!\u201d Wang Shuping took a deep breath and could only persuade Wang Shijing, who was silent. \u201cWang Shijing, my father is angry, why don\u2019t you go back first.\u201d Wang Wenhe slapped the table. \u201cWhat!? I still have more to say to him!\u201dWang Shijing spoke. \u201cMy parents and my brother didn\u2019t want me first.\u201d When he said this, Wang Wenhe choked for a moment, so Wang Shijing continued. \u201cFive years ago, you were the patriarch, but I still couldn\u2019t escape from the two years of forced labor. Three years ago, you were also the patriarch, and I was still forced to join military service. When Song was at home you were also the patriarch, but she was forced out by my mother and that good sister-in-law. When I came back, you were still the patriarch but I was forced to marry and leave the house. Patriarch, if Yunan had not gone to the county school today to look for Wang Zhisong, what did you plan to do?\u201dWang Wenhe was speechless, even Wang Shuping did not expect Wang Shijing to say such words. Then Wang Shijing said on his behalf, \u201cYou will definitely still listen to my mother. Even if you don\u2019t say that I should hand over all the money, she would take at least half of it and I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep that stone either.\u201d Wang Wenhe\u2019s lips trembled, he could not argue since he originally intended to do so.Wang Shijing clenched his fist. \u201cI am a member of the Wang clan, but I can\u2019t rely on my own clan, so I can only think of my own way out. My own mother and brother do not give me a way to live, so I can only earn my own way to live. If you think I\u2019ve done something wrong, you can remove me from the clan geology. Anyway, I\u2019m the only one from my family in the geology. Even if I am a member of the clan, what is the difference between me and people without a clan? I can\u2019t even protect my own wife and children!\u201dWang Shijing pointed to his own eyes. \u201cIf I had reacted a beat slower, this knife would have cut through my neck. Wang Tianyan\u2019s life is fate, but my life is not fate. Wang Zhisong\u2019s life is fate, but mine isn\u2019t. My life in the clan is not even worth five taels of silver. Anyway Shao Yunan also separated from his family, so I might as well give him peace and separate, so I will have nothing more to do with the Wang clan!\u201dLeaving this last sentence, Wang Shijing turned around and left, walking resolutely and decisively.\u201cWang Shijing.\u201d Wang Shuping chased after him. But at the door without giving Wang Shuping a chance to persuade him, Wang Shijing said directly, \u201cBrother Shuping, tell the patriarch that I, Wang Shijing, have no regrets about what happened today! What I said at the gate of the county school was also not due to anger. I, Wang Shijing, will have nothing to do with the clan anymore. I remember everything the clan has done to me and to my two children.\u201dAfter saying that, Wang Shijing walked away, leaving behind Wang Shuping, who was speechless. Looking at his resolute back, Wang Shuping could not help but shiver.Edited by: JaislandProofreader:Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

While thinking of his two children, the depression in his heart instantly dissipated a lot. Closing the door, he stood for a while in place, before going to wash his hands. Only then, did he push open the door and enter the house. Entering the house, he smelled the aroma of food.\u201cYou\u2019re back, let\u2019s eat. Qing and Nizi have already eaten at Uncle Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house, so you and I can just eat something.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Wang Shijing went over to the kang bed. Wang Qing got out of bed and said, \u201cFather, I\u2019ll serve you soup.\u201dShao Yunan cooked a pot of mushroom and cabbage soup with sliced meat and the buns they had bought in the county town before their return. But Shao Yunan stopped Wang Qing. \u201cWait, wait for your father to calm down before eating. If he eats in this mood. he might get sick.\u201dWang Qing and Wang Nizi immediately looked at their father. Shao Yunan thought one oil lamp was too dark, so he lit the second oil lamp in the house. The two children may not see that Wang Shijing was burning with anger, but Shao Yunan could see it clearly.Shao Yunan said, \u201cQing go and boil water so you and Nizi can wash up first, then you can go to bed early tonight.\u201d\u201cMm-hmm.\u201dWang Qing carried his sister off the bed and led her out by holding her hand. As soon as the door closed, Shao Yunan pushed the bowl of water he hadn\u2019t drunk yet, in front of Wang Shijing and asked, \u201cDid Zhao Lizheng and the patriarch blame you?\u201dWang Shijing drank the bowl of water in one gulp, wiped his mouth, and said, \u201cUncle Zhao didn\u2019t blame me. When I went there, Uncle Sun was also there. As the Sun clan patriarch. he also didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d\u201cSo what did Wang Wenhe say?\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s expression suddenly became gloomy, so Shao Yunan said, \u201cDon\u2019t be angry. It\u2019s normal for him to be unhappy. They are still counting on Wang Zhisong to earn clan merit.\u201dShao Yunan has the memory of the original body owner, so he easily forgave him for having a sense of immersion and identification with this ancient clan. In modern society, even if there are places where clans still existed, it was mostly due to nostalgia.Wang Shijing was silent for a while before he said, \u201cShao Yunan, tomorrow I will go to Zhao Lizheng and write deed of separation. We will divorce and then you can marry me again. In this way, you won\u2019t have to be held back by the Wang clan because of me.\u201dDue to this first sentence, Shao Yunan was so surprised that the bun in his mouth almost fell out, but when Wang Shijing said the next sentence, the bun really fell as Shao Yunan choked on his own saliva.Wang Shijing hurriedly moved over to pat him on the back. Shao Yunan, coughing and laughing, was a little sad. This honest man even thought of such a \u2018bad trick.\u2019 Shao Yunan really wanted to hold his face and nibble on him, saying. \u201cHow can you be so cute?\u201d To be honest, Wang Shijing\u2019s performance time after time changed Shao Yunan\u2019s expectation of him.Finally, Shao Yunan wiped the corners of his eyes and smiled as he said, \u201cI have all your money, what would you use as a dowry?\u201d Wang Shijing suddenly became a little embarrassed. Of course, he doesn\u2019t understand the word \u2018embarrassed\u2019 so Shao Yunan continued to tease him, \u201cI married you and become a little father for Wang Qing and Wang Nizi. Besides\u2026\u201d Shao Yunan lustfully measured Wang Shijing\u2026 \u201cIf I marry you, I will need to call you my wife in the future\u2026\u201d He stopped talking at this point, Wang Shijing definitely already understood. Wouldn\u2019t he have to be the wife at night?Wang Shijing cleared his throat awkwardly and suddenly felt impulsive. Shao Yunan took off his blindfold and threw it aside as he patted his chest saying, \u201cThat Wang Wenhe acted old-fashioned, so It was hard for him to not get angry. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not even afraid of the county magistrate, so how can I be afraid of him? At the worst, we will go to the county town and buy a house there, moving out of the village. As long as we have enough money, any clan law is bullshit. If you earn thousands of taels of silver a year and directly donate money to get an official position, we would see who still would dare to say such nonsense. When the time comes, not to mention saying you were wrong, it will be too late to carry favor with you.\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s heart thumped: \u201cTen thousand taels of silver?\u201d Shao Yunan gave him a rare and strange look. \u201cEven if not tens of thousands of taels, we will definitely earn thousands of taels. You can wait until you become a big boss in the future, well, we will work hard first to earn money, while raising Wang Qing and Nizi to become outstanding. So in the future, Wang Qing can become a big official and Nizi a noble lady. Don\u2019t you think they will want to curry favor with us then?\u201d\u201cCan Wang Zhisong compare to you? Even if he gets the first position, he will be rejected sooner or later. Do you really think that in this world it is so easy for poor students to mix in? You can\u2019t just be in first position during the examination. Without background, other officials\u2019 support, luck, and charisma, there are many talented students from poor families, so why would people let him become an official in power? With his virtue and vision, it would already be nice if he is able to get out of Xiushui village.\u201dIf other people told Wang Shijing something like this, Wang Shijing would only think he was daydreaming. But Shao Yunan\u2019s words made his heart thump, feeling that what he said might come true.\u201cAll right, don\u2019t be angry. You can also be regarded as someone who has gone out to see the world. With this kind of life in the village, what is said is as good as nonsense said by a frog at the bottom of the well. Wang Wenhe understanding or not, will not affect our life. There is soup in the pot for you, eat it quickly. We will have to dry out the tea soon, or it will affect the taste. It should be dealt with right away. \u201cWang Shijing was not angry at all. He just felt that his whole body was full of energy, so he got off the Kang bed and went outside. At this time, there was a sudden knocking at the door, making Shao Yunan a bit annoyed. Who is it at this hour?Wang Qing, who was in the kitchen, ran out first to open the door. Opening the door, he looked at the people outside and his first reaction was to turn around and run deeper inside the house without even shouting. Bumping into them, he shouted in horror, \u201cDad! Grandpa and little aunt are here!\u201d Holy shit! Shao Yunan almost lifted the table with him.\u201cBig brother, are you home? Why is little Qing shouting when he sees someone?\u201d With a slightly bossy tone, a female voice sounded as the sound of footsteps came from outside the house. At this time Wang Shijing found his own blindfold and put it on.Shao Yunan asked Wang Qing to go back to washing up and taking good care of Wang Nizi. After the door was pushed open, Wang Qing shouted in a low voice reluctantly, \u201cGrandpa, little aunt.\u201d Then he ran out to hide. When Wang Nizi heard it was grandpa and little aunt who came, she was so scared that she hid in the kitchen and didn\u2019t dare to come out.Wang Dali\u2019s face was sullen, while Wang Shijing\u2019s sister, Wang Chunxiu also had an unhappy expression. As soon as the two entered the room, Shao Yunan put his chopsticks on the table with force, his expression even darker than the two of them. This sound made Wang Dali and Wang Chunxiu\u2019s bodies jolt, while Shao Yunan pretended to glare at Wang Shijing. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to scoop soup for me?\u201d The tone of his voice was that of a typical \u2018bit*h.\u2019Wang Shijing silently picked up Shao Yunan\u2019s bowl and silently went to scoop soup for him. Wang Dali and Wang Chunxiu did not look at Shao Yunan as they said at the same time. \u201cShijing (big brother).\u201dWang Shijing stopped, but someone refused to follow. \u201cWhat are you waiting for? The soup is getting cold! I might have a stomachache!\u201dWang Shijing opened the door and went out. Wang Chunxiu looked at Shao Yunan angrily, but Shao Yunan just stared back. \u201cWho are you, coming to our house at night? Are you married yet? If not, hurry up and get out, don\u2019t attract gossip.\u201dWang Chunxiu\u2019s face immediately flushed with shame. Wang Dali was a person who could not speak well so in the face of Shao Yunan\u2019s sharp tongue, he had no ability to fight back. Wang Chunxiu, who couldn\u2019t count on her own father, said blushingly, \u201cI\u2019m Wang Chunxiu. Do I need to mind you when I come to my elder brother\u2019s house?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You have the nerve to say that he is your brother. You have not even shown up for the wedding, so what\u2019s the point of coming to my house now?\u201dWang Chunxiu\u2019s lips moved as she nudged her own father. Wang Dali looked toward the door, waiting for Wang Shijing to come in. But Shao Yunan already became so angry, he raised his voice to shout. \u201cWang Qing, go and call Zhao Lizheng! Say that someone from the Wang family is making trouble again!\u201dWang Dali\u2019s body tensed and Wang Chunxiu also became anxious as she called out. \u201cBig brother! Did you really forget your mother after marrying your wife? Look at how your wife bullies people!\u201dHalf of the soup was still left in Shao Yunan\u2019s bowl. When he entered the kitchen, Wang Shijing drank the remaining half of the soup. Hearing the shouts of Shao Yunan and his sister one after another, he asked the children to go to his and Shao Yunan\u2019s room first, He then scooped a bowl of soup for Shao Yunan and carried it into the room.Before Wang Shijing even set foot into the room, Wang Chunxiu called out again, \u201cBig brother! You really don\u2019t want your parents and siblings anymore, do you? Second brother and second sister-in-law were arrested and Wang Zhisong was punished by the Dean and you didn\u2019t say a word? Look at what your wife has done. Look at how he treated me and father!\u201d\u201cHe is your\u00a0 sister-in-law!\u201d Wang Shijing blocked Wang Chunxiu\u2019s discontent with one sentence. Putting the bowl in front of Shao Yunan, Wang Shijing looked directly at his father and said, \u201cI know why you have come to see me. I already spoke about it with Zhao Lizheng and the patriarch. Wang Tianyan and Wang guo were punished by the county magistrate and Wang Zhisong was punished by the Dean of the county school. I have already begged for mercy for them.\u201dWang Chunxiu opened her mouth and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you have a jade plate from the county magistrate? Go to the county magistrate! Or use that money to redeem second brother and sister-in-law ,since you are not short of money.\u201d Damn. Shao Yunan, who has never hit a woman, really wanted to do it now.\u201cWang Shijing, whose jade plate is that? Whose money is that money?\u201d Shao Yunan said in a cold voice, making Wang Chunxiu\u2019s body tremble again. If a girl could not be as vicious as old lady Wang, she was really not an opponent for the cold faced Shao Yunan.Wang Shijing replied, \u201cThe jade plate is your sister-in-law\u2019s, the money is also earned by your sister-in-law and he is in charge of them.\u201d Wang Chunxiu immediately said, \u201cWhat is your wife\u2019s is yours, isn\u2019t it?\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s face also became cold. \u201cIf you keep saying \u2018my wife\u2019 without any respect, get out!\u201d Wang Chunxiu could not believe that this was the older brother she remembered. The older brother who never said a word, who was just as lame as her father. Wang Dali finally spoke. \u201cShijing, that\u2019s your brother!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a brother who only thinks about his brother\u2019s family\u2019s wealth all day long and bullies his sister-in-law, niece, and nephew!\u201d Wang Shijing was full of momentum. \u201cBefore you come to me, why don\u2019t you take a look at how they treat me first?\u201d To Wang Chunxiu, whose face became pale and was too frightened to say a word he said, \u201cYou are saying \u2018your wife\u2019 but you didn\u2019t even show up when I married your sister-in-law. Do you still even know I am your elder brother?! When you made Nizi wash your clothes on cold days, did you still think of me as your eldest brother? If nothing had happened to Wang Tianyan and Wang Zhisong, would you have even stepped into my house? I already separated and your sister-in-law is not a woman. You should not come here since you are still a girl who is not married.\u201dEven Wang Tianyan couldn\u2019t stand the full momentum of Wang Shijing, let alone Wang Chunxiu. Wang Chunxiu, who was spoken to like this burst into tears while Wang Dali with muddy eyes looked coldly at Wang Shijing asking coldly, \u201cYou really don\u2019t care?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d\u201cAs if he dares to care!\u201d Shao Yunan said. \u201cI am the master of this family. I told him to face west so let\u2019s see if he dares to face east.\u201d Taking out the jade plate from his pocket and putting it on the table, Shao Yunan said arrogantly. \u201cIf you have the ability, take it and go beg the county magistrate to let people go. But don\u2019t even think of taking a copper coin from my family! Is it the tradition of the Wang family to fear wifes? When you can control mother-in-law, you can come back to your son to make the decision.\u201d Glancing mockingly at Wang Dali, who felt ashamed, Shao Yunan yelled at Wang Shijing, \u201cThere are so many things left unpacked, hurry up and unpack them!\u201dWang Shijing, an honest man who was \u2018afraid of his wife\u2019 obediently went out, while Shao Yunan pointed at the door. \u201cTake care. Wang Chunxiu, from now on, if you casually step into my door, I will say that you tried to seduce me.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Wang Chunxiu burst into tears. What a shame! How can you say such words casually. Wang Dali\u2019s lips trembled as he grabbed his daughter and rushed out, afraid that if they go even one step too slow, an unpleasant gossip might start. Old lady Wang and Wang Dali were both trying to find a big family for Wang Chunxiu to marry into. Wang Chunxiu also didn\u2019t need her father pulling her, she wished she hadn\u2019t come in the first place!When the two left, Wang Qing, who was watching, immediately ran out and closed the courtyard door. Wang Shijing peeked into the room, while Shao Yunan who just put away the jade plate just said, \u201cHurry up and eat.\u201dWang Shijing made no mention of Shao Yunan\u2019s domineering treatment of him just now. He just sat down on the bed and said, \u201cThe soup in your bowl was cold so I drank it. I scooped you a warm one so hurry up and eat it.\u201d\u201cFather, eat.\u201dWang Qing came in with a bowl, and behind him was Wang Nizi with a plate of hot buns in her hands. Shao Yunan was not embarrassed because Wang Shijing drank his soup, so the two of them stuffed their stomachs before Wang Shijing went out with the empty bowls and plates, so that Wang Qing and Wang Nizi could go to bed early.As the two children laid down, Wang Nizi asked, \u201cBrother, Dad won\u2019t go away again, will he?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWe won\u2019t be bullied again, will we?\u201d\u201cWith little dad around we won\u2019t. Go to sleep Nizi, we have to get up early tomorrow to help with father and little dad\u2019s work.\u201d\u201cMmm!\u201dWang Nizi obediently closed her eyes and went to sleep. However, Wang Qing still kept his eyes open. Grandparents, second uncle, little uncle, and little aunt all treated their father and mother like that, wasn\u2019t it because of little uncle\u2019s studies? If he could also study, he must be better than his uncle. He would take the top position during the examination, so no one would ever dare to bully him and his sister, or his father and little dad!After the two children went to bed, Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing were not asleep yet. Shao Yunan went to handle the tea, while Wang Shijing went to take care of other things. Today, Shao Yunan bought a lot of things, including large round winnowing baskets, which farmers here used to dry beans and dry goods. Shao Yunan had no time to wave them like people here, so he first bought seven or eight, ready-made for drying tea.The tea leaves were spread out on the bamboo winnowing basket according to the different ways of plucking tea. On one bamboo winnowing basket, wild chrysanthemums were drying. The small bag of sweet-scented osmanthus picked by Shao Yunan was lavishly put on a piece of paper to dry, but there wasn\u2019t much of it.By the time Wang Shijing neatly moved and arranged all the dry goods into the cellar, Shao Yunan finished spreading out the tea leaves to dry. As soon as Wang Shijing came, Shao Yunan said, \u201cFreshly picked tea leaves should be spread out like this to dry for about an hour. It should have been spread out after picking otherwise it would ferment. This kind of tea would taste bad as soon as it is fermented.\u201dWang Shijing asked anxiously, \u201cIs it fermented now?\u201d This was the first time he has heard that tea can ferment.Shao Yunan smelled the tea and said, \u201cI will deal with it, since it\u2019s not fresh anymore. We won\u2019t sleep tonight, in making tea, time is the key. You go and wash out the two raw iron pots you bought and dry them. Then find some lime that is not too damp.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dWang Shijing went to wash the pots. There were only two rooms and a kitchen here, with a small amount of miscellaneous supplies, which were not cleaned up and old. Shao Yunan decided to simply make tea in his and Wang Shijing\u2019s room. The conditions were very simple, but he will make do with them. He did not expect to find tea so soon, so it seems that they should hurry up to buy the land and build a house.Shao Yunan went to the kitchen to get a ladle, then went quickly into the space to get a scoop of spiritual water. He then took out the bottle containing spiritual essence and added a few drops inside before stirring it. Shao Yunan sprinkled the water on the tea leaves with the palm of his hand. Ordinary water would certainly aggravate the fermentation of tea, but spiritual water with spiritual essence was a good nourishment.The tea leaves and the winnowing basket of wild chrysanthemums were sprinkled with spiritual water. Shao Yunan carefully looked at the wick of the oil lamp and estimated the time. He had a watch in his spiritual space, but he would have to look for it. He also didn\u2019t know when Wang Shijing would come back. So for now, he could only estimate the time with this crude method. Because of the sprinkling of spiritual water the drying process would take a little longer.Longjing belongs to the fried green tea group, so after picking, the production process contained several steps, such as selecting, withering, fixation (using high temperature to destroy or stop further biochemical reactions caused by enzymes), roasting, and crushing and several other processes to produce a good Longjing tea. Since there was no Xihu lake here, Shao Yunan couldn\u2019t call it Xihu Longjing Tea. A kilogram of Longjing tea requires four to five kilograms of fresh leaves, Shao Yunan estimated that they picked about 20 kilograms of fresh leaves this time. More than twenty ancient trees might sound like a lot, but one ancient tree could produce about one kilo of tea leaves, that\u2019s why ancient tea was so valuable. It was precisely because ancient tea trees produced so little tea, that it led to the popularization of tea.The tea plantations that people see in modern times were actually made from new teas that could be produced in large quantities by modern means, commonly known as tea. In other words, the top buds are subtracted so that the branches could keep branching out, so that more tea leaves could be produced. Naturally, in terms of taste it couldn\u2019t be compared to ancient tree tea. Shao Yunan was not greedy, he was already satisfied with the 23 ancient tea trees. But if someone tried to rob him, he would move all 23 ancient tea trees to his space and then cut branches in the space. He was filled with confidence due to his space.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When Shao Yunan was cleaning, Wang Shijing came back. Seeing Shao Yunan working, he put down the lime blocks he found and went to help.\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d Stopping Wang Shijing, Shao Yunan said, \u201cYou will burn your hands!\u201d Wang Shijing has some lime foam on his hands, which would suddenly start to become hot when in contact with water. Pulling Wang Shijing to the side, Shao Yunan first took a clean cloth to carefully wipe Wang Shijing\u2019s hands, before going back to the kitchen to wash his hands with vinegar. Only then did he let Wang Shijing wash his hands with water.\u201cFrom now on, use a cloth to cover your hands.\u201d\u201cAi.\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s mood was very good as he washed his hands carefully. It still felt a little hot, so he didn\u2019t use the bath beans and only finished when the vinegar smell dispersed. \u201cI\u2019ll wash what you want washed, so don\u2019t touch cold water.\u201d Wang Shijing took over Shao Yunan\u2019s job, while Shao Yunan just gave him a look. \u201cI am not a woman.\u201d Wang Shijing said reasonably, \u201cI do the rough work at home.\u201dShao Yunan stretched out his hand and said, \u201cI have also done rough work.\u201d He has thick calluses on his hands, since the original body owner worked hard in the Shao family. Wang Shijing grabbed Shao Yunan\u2019s hand and took this opportunity to put his arms around him. \u201cMy wife, my heart aches. In the future I will do all the rough work at home. You are still young, so don\u2019t wear yourself out early.\u201dShao Yunan\u2019s cheeks next to Wang Shijing\u2019s chest burned hot, also making his heart hot. It was not that people didn\u2019t chase after him, on the contrary, there were many people chasing after him\u2026 both men and women of various statuses. But except for the two unsuccessful romances, he has always been very cautious. He has a spiritual space, so if there was someone close to him, the secret of his space cannot be kept. So he was always cautious.Now that he went back thousands of years, being held by an ancient man for the first time, he felt unspeakable restlessness, from the inside out. \u201cFrom the time you married me, I have not let you live in peace and today I have even made you suffer. Wife, doesn\u2019t mind that I am blind, disfigured, and have two children. I will treat you well, I will love you, I will listen to you in everything, so please don\u2019t leave me.\u201dIt could be said that it was his family environment that forced him to be silent, but after separating from his family and meeting Shao Yunan, Wang Shijing gradually began to release his own nature that was suppressed for more than twenty years.If Wang Shijing did not have such worries before, then after he personally saw Shao Yunan face the county magistrate, the Dean of the county school, and other people with such ease and wisdom, he became afraid.\u00a0 He was afraid that with his coarse and incompetent personality, he would not able to keep this person at all. He wanted this person very much, especially after Shao Yunan said that \u2018after that I will love you.\u2019 Because of this, Wang Shijing, who was used to silence, couldn\u2019t wait to say what was in his heart\u2026 as long as he could keep this person.Shao Yunan felt that his breath started to get hot, but at this moment he was a bit greedy for the warmth of Wang Shijing\u2019s chest. On second thought, he was not pretentious. He and Wang Shijing were now a couple, Wang Shijing also had a good body so why should he still act reserved after being a virgin for 26 years? Especially when this guy was so obedient. As for the future divorce, it would depend on Wang Shijing\u2019s performance.Shao Yunan leaned openly and said, \u201cThat depends on your performance. If you want to have three wives and four concubines or something in the future, I will definitely divorce you.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s words were resolute and loyal. \u201cI already said that it will be you who will make the decisions in our family. If you tell me to face west I won\u2019t face east. I only want you. You will be my only wife.\u201d He held him tighter.\u201cYou didn\u2019t care about this marriage or me just two days ago.\u201d Wang Shijing pursed his lips. \u201cI originally wanted to marry you and then divorce you. I know you certainly did not want to marry me.\u201d\u201cYou are very self-aware.\u201d Shao Yunan lifted his face with a flirtatious smile. Wang Shijing looked at that smile, gathered his courage, and then bent down to kiss him.\u201cOh!\u201dShao Yunan subconsciously struggled, but how could he struggle when with his height, he only reached Wang Shijing\u2019s chest? The thick pure masculine breath entered Shao Yunan\u2019s mouth along with the lips that were touching together. Finally Shao Yunan couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. This was the original body owner\u2019s first kiss, but it wasn\u2019t Shao Yunan\u2019s first kiss. But even then Shao Yunan was under the illusion that this was his first kiss, this person was seducing him!Wang Shijing\u2019s tongue eagerly pried open Shao Yunan\u2019s mouth, touching and sucking on his soft red lips. He wanted to secure this person as soon as possible, wanted this person to stay by his side in peace and not have the slightest thought of leaving.Strands of numbness rushed straight from his tailbone to his brain. Shao Yunan became so dizzy that he was unable to stand. Wang Shijing picked him up with a brute force by his ass and strode into the house.The beds in the house were covered with sun-dried tea. When Wang Shijing pressed Shao Yunan into the door, the door issued a loud rattling sound. Shao Yunan could only gasp for air, Wang Shijing\u2019s masculinity was so strong that it left a pure zero without any power to fight.\u201cAh!\u201dShao Yunan, whose neck was sucked on, felt dizzy. He instinctively held Wang Shijing\u2019s head and let his legs lock around his waist, still in the state of confusion.Their bodies had reacted so Shao Yunan sensed a hard thing poking his ass. Because it was cold, Shao Yunan wore two pairs of pants, but Wang Shijing wore only one. He also didn\u2019t have to guess what this hard thing was.\u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201dEdited by: JaislandProofreader:Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wang Shijing sucked on his\u00a0 nip*le till it became swollen and then turned to the next one. Shao Yunan twisted his lower body, which already felt uncomfortable. Wang Shijing held Shao Yunan with one hand and untied his trousers with the other. His untied trousers slid to his feet.Sucking Shao Yunan\u2019s flat chest was like sucking milk. From sucking his chest swollen, he then moved to sucking his mouth, and then left hickeys on his neck and chest, as if declaring his sovereignty over Shao Yunan. Shao Yunan\u2019s body was young, so in a short while he screamed and ejac*lated. Before Wang Shijing could come, he put Shao Yunan down and turned him around, continuing to suck on his back. Grinding his burning manhood on the peak of Shao Yunan\u2019s buttocks. Without any intention of entering the enchanting place.Shao Yunan didn\u2019t know how long it took him to ejac*late the second time. His back was sucked and bitten so hard that he couldn\u2019t feel it anymore. From behind him, Wang Shijing\u2019s muffled grunts could be heard as soon as a hot stream sprayed on Shao Yunan\u2019s buttocks. Shao Yunan slumped helplessly against the door, his eyes closed as he gasped for air. Wang Shijing\u2019s lips were still nibbling on his neck, enjoying the afterglow with closed eyes.At this point, Shao Yunan did not understand how things could have come to this stage. Aren\u2019t they supposed to be brothers at first? \u201cDid you eat some aphrodisiac when you went out?\u201d Shao Yunan asked breathlessly, his low voice was thick with languid temptation.Wang Shijing kissed Shao Yunan\u2019s shoulder with a satisfied expression. \u201cYou are my wife.\u201d\u201cI just married you!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re already a few days late to consummate our marriage.\u201dShao Yunan\u2019s eyes opened in surprise. \u201cThis was marriage consummation?\u201d This guy clearly doesn\u2019t know how men have sex at all!But apparently Shao Yunan was thinking too much. Wang Shijing took off his clothes while wiping Shao Yunan and himself, saying, \u201cYou are still young. Doing that thing too early is not good for your body. I didn\u2019t understand it before, but when I went to the army I listened to the military doctor a lot. When you are over eighteen, we will really consummate our marriage.\u00a0 According to the military doctor, you should always maintain your health. Otherwise, not to mention giving birth to children, you will also suffer when you are old.\u201dShao Yunan became so dizzy that he turned around and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to give birth to children.\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s movements stopped as he pursed his lips.Shao Yunan was not soft-hearted. \u201cYou already have a son and a daughter, so you have a pair. I don\u2019t want to get pregnant, let alone suffer from that.\u201dWang Shijing continued to pull up Shao Yunan\u2019s trousers, his expression returning to normal. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, you won\u2019t. You haven\u2019t eaten the pregnancy fruit, have you?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Shao Yunan was not sure. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I don\u2019t remember eating any strange fruit\u2026 it\u2019s fruit, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Wang Shijing put on his pants and said, \u201cUsually it can only be eaten after marriage. The fruit is white and you have to go to the Yamen to apply for it. It also has to be soaked with medicines before you can eat it, so you shouldn\u2019t have eaten it. If you don\u2019t want it, we won\u2019t do it. It hurts both men and women to have children, for men it will be even more painful. I also don\u2019t want you to suffer.\u201dShao Yunan became very satisfied with that.. He hadn\u2019t eaten any white fruit with medicinal flavor in his memory. He gave Wang Shijing a punch and said, \u201cI said that we need to make tea tonight.\u201dWang Shijing bent over and kissed his wife\u2019s red and swollen mouth. \u201cTeach me. Then I will do it.\u201dShao Yunan narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhy do I suddenly feel that your integrity is just pretend? Is it too late to return the goods?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too late, you are already my wife.\u201d Wang Shijing kissed Shao Yunan\u2019s mouth once more in high spirits. This man belongs to him, doesn\u2019t he?Wang Dali and Wang Chunxiu returned home without success. Wang Chunxiu after returning home, ran back to her room in tears. Old lady Wang asked what was going on, but Wang Chunxiu didn\u2019t reply. Wang Dali finally choked out a sentence. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out.\u201dAs soon as old lady Wang heard that it didn\u2019t work out, she burst into tears again and wanted to go to Wang Shijing herself. But this time Wang Zhisong stopped her and said angrily, \u201cMother, you should stop causing trouble. If you had been willing to discuss it with me before, we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation now. He is already separated from our family, but you are still asking him for money. Yet you didn\u2019t get any money, but you\u2019ve even dragged second brother and me into it.\u201cSo you\u2019re just going to let it go? Just let your second brother be arrested and yourself be punished for three months?\u201d Old lady Wang was unwilling. She used to hold her eldest son in the palm of her hands and he didn\u2019t dare to act tough with her. It was all because of this evil star!Wang Zhisong said impatiently, \u201cWhat else can we do? They have the county magistrate as a backer, but what do we have? Now we can only wait for me to pass the exam next year.\u201d\u201cHow can I be so miserable\u2026\u201d Old lady Wang patted her thigh and cried. Wang Dali couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you use money to redeem Wang Tianyan and sister in law?\u201d This sentence immediately poked at old lady Wang\u2019s hornet\u2019s nest. \u201cUse the money? Where will I get money from? If you want to take it, it should be from those two evil stars.\u201d Wang Dali was scolded and stopped talking.Wang Zhisong took a few deep breaths. \u201cMother, which of the county magistrates of Yongxiu Province didn\u2019t stay for a few years and then left? When the county magistrate leaves, what backer will they have? At this time your son might already be a scholar. Let\u2019s put up with it for now. When the county magistrate leaves in the future, it will be easy for us to retaliate back. It\u2019s better to spend money to redeem second oldest brother and sister-in-law, otherwise some people will say that I don\u2019t care about my elder brother.\u201dOld lady Wang stopped crying, but still ached with pain. \u201cHow can our family have so much money to redeem them? How can I be so miserable\u2026?\u201dWang Chunxiu came out of her room after she stopped crying and said, \u201cMother, go to the patriarch and ask him how much money it will cost to redeem people. If it\u2019s too much, it\u2019s just a matter of course, otherwise others will only say that our family refuses to help redeem people.\u201dWang Zhisong said, \u201cGo ask. It would be best to redeem them. The most important thing now is my reputation. Before the county magistrate leaves, I must get admitted to the examination, so let\u2019s put up with it.\u201dWang Chunxiu gritted her teeth. \u201cWang Zhisong, you must get admitted. You also better take the top spot and take good care of these two people, especially that Shao Yunan. I just want to tear his mouth apart!\u201dOld lady Wang was still reluctant. \u201cThey got a lot of money from selling those strange stones, so after just separating they were able to buy this and that, but they didn\u2019t even give me a piece of meat.\u201d\u201cMother! You should listen to Wang Zhisong and stop it! We can\u2019t beat them now!\u201d Wang Chunxiu advised. Wang Zhisong said, \u201cMother for my sake, bear with it for now. I swear that this humiliation will be repaid in future!\u201dOld lady Wang wiped the corners of her eyes and said, \u201cAlright, mother will listen to you.\u201d A child who was eavesdropping behind the curtain in the other room, bit his lips hard.\u201cHiss\u2026!\u201d After taking a breath, Shao Yunan rubbed his chest again and glared at the man pretending to be a fool. When the fun was over, the after-effects also came. The place where Wang Shijing had nibbled was numb and painful, especially the two nipples and lips. Under the guidance of Shao Yunan, Wang Shijing, who exhausted him, hurriedly apologized again. \u201cI\u2019ll pay more attention in the future, I just couldn\u2019t help it.\u201dThe \u2018old\u2019 man who has been holding back for three years was very eager. Shao Yunan only dared to complain, since they were now in a crucial step, they couldn\u2019t be distracted.\u00a0 After the temperature of the raw iron pot reaches 80 to 100 degrees, they added a small amount of soybean oil and then threw in a certain amount of tea leaves and began fixation. During this process, fingers could easily get scalded. After a while Shao Yunan went into the house and wore two more pairs of wire gloves due to injury.Wang Shijing was naturally surprised, but he did not ask anything. Putting on his own gloves, he followed Shao Yunan\u2019s instructions. Shao Yunan gave Wang Shijing a bud with three leaves and four leaves, which was the lowest grade of the tea he wanted to make. This could be used by Wang Shijing for practice. For the tender buds with one or two leaves, Shao Yunan still had to prepare them himself. Leaving the main stove for Shao Yunan to use, Wang Shijing used the other stove, while also being responsible for keeping the fire.After the fixation of the tea is finished, it should be placed in a cool place to regain its moisture. After regaining the moisture, it should be screened before putting it into the pot for further roasting. After roasting it could finally be crushed and divided into bags. Then using the lime block to seal the jars, the Longjing tea was considered finished.Both of them vented their desires during the night and didn\u2019t have much time to rest, but Shao Yunan who drank some spiritual spring water did not feel particularly tired. At dawn, Shao Yunan put the last bag of tea into the jar and sealed it together with Wang Shijing. Only then did he let himself relax. After seven days, when they opened the seal, the tea would be ready to drink.\u201cWife go to sleep, I will take the jars to Wang Qing and Nizi\u2019s room.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t sleep. I have a lot of things to do today. I will cook. You can wake Wang Qing and Nizi up. After a meal I will teach them a few words and then send them to Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house while we take a trip up the mountain.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go, you should rest.\u201d Wang Shijing felt sorry for his wife. \u201cI\u2019m not sleepy. The water in our house is refreshing so you should also drink a little more.\u201d Shao Yunan said, as he went to boil the water. Wang Shijing\u2019s one eye sank, but he didn\u2019t say anything about letting his wife go to bed anymore.Wang Shijing went to place the jars, while Wang Qing and Wang Nizi woke up. The two children were not told that they had not slept all night, as Shao Yunan simply made breakfast. After a quick meal, he taught the two children how to recognize the first five words in the book and then asked Wang Shijing to send them to Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house in case something went wrong while they were away.After Wang Shijing took the children away, Shao Yunan fished out the crab feet that had been soaking in the spiritual spring water overnight and put them in the yard to dry. There were also many other things that needed to be dried out. Filling two gourds with spiritual water and then dripping a few drops of spiritual milk inside, Shao Yunan also packed up some dry food before waiting for Wang Shijing to come back.Wang Shijing came back soon and after taking up his bow and arrows, he went out with Shao Yunan. After seeing the two of them go to the west side of the mountain, the villagers were no longer curious. Since Wang Shijing had served in the army for three years, he was not even afraid to take his wife up the mountain with him. What happened yesterday was still the main talk of the villagers, so many people were observing old lady Wang\u2019s family situation.Since Wang Zhisong studied at the private school, the teacher had praised him for his intelligence and old lady Wang began to not look at people with a straight face. When Wang Zhisong passed the examination and entered the county school as a child student, old lady Wang became even more overbearing. Wang Zhisong was originally arrogant and the Wang family was not very popular, except for Wang Shijing. So at this time if no one laughed at them it would be strange.Unable to take revenge on Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan, old lady Wang concentrated on Wang Chunxiu. In theory, since Wang Chunxiu was already 17 years old, she should be married. But Wang Chunxiu\u2019s marriage has not yet been decided. Old lady Wang wanted to wait for Wang Zhisong to be admitted as a scholar before deciding on Wang Chunxiu\u2019s marriage. Wang Zhisong will be able to take the examination next year, so old lady Wang was full of confidence.But now, Wang Zhisong\u2019s reputation was damaged and he was even chastised by the county school\u2019s Dean. Even old lady Wang was not stupid enough to not understand the seriousness of this matter, so she changed her mind and decided to find Wang Chunxiu a wealthy family to help Wang Zhisong. On one hand, she will be able to get backing for Wang Zhisong, while on another, she will be able to help Wang Zhisong with money.After breakfast, old lady Wang first went to the patriarch\u2019s house to ask him for help with redeeming Wang Tianyan and Wang Guo. Then she asked Wang Dali to drive the cart to the village. Wang Chunxiu, who didn\u2019t know that her mother was worried about her marriage, became bothered by it. Wang Tianyan and Wang Guo were arrested, and Wang Zhisong also could not attend classes but no one came to see him.In the past when Song was around, she was the one who washed Wang Chunxiu\u2019s clothes including the dirty underpants changed every month during her period. Later when the Song ran away and Wang Nizi was still too young, Wang Chunxiu who was after all a big girl could not let Wang Qing wash it, so she threw them to Wang Guo. Wang Guo\u2019s own clothes were also used to be thrown to Song, so the aunt and little sister in law quarreled a lot. But every time Wang Guo lost, she was the daughter-in-law while Wang Chunxiu was the family daughter.Later, when Wang Nizi grew older, Wang Guo and Wang Chunxiu threw their clothes to Wang Nizi and stopped arguing. So, before Wang Shijing came back, the men\u2019s clothes were thrown to Wang Qing to wash, while women\u2019s clothes were tossed to Wang Nizi to wash. Wang Qing and Wang Nizi didn\u2019t speak about these things in detail with their two fathers, but aunt Wang told Shao Yunan about it. That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t show any goodwill towards Wang Shijing\u2019s only sister. Anyway, it would be better if Wang Shijing was completely cold hearted to all the members of this family.Wang Guo was in prison and Wang Nizi left with her father. There was no one left in the family to wash clothes, cook, and feed the pigs and the chickens\u2026 Wang Zhisong didn\u2019t work, Wang Dali was busy with the work in the fields so Wang Chunxiu couldn\u2019t be lazy even if she wanted to now. Wang Zauzheng was not Wang Qing. He hid faster than anyone else when he was told to work. Looking at the work she needed to do, Wang Chunxiu blamed her mother for letting Wang Shijing separate.Edited by: JaislandProofreader:Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhao Lizheng also knew a few words so he could advise them a little. Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing went up the mountain and were very busy picking sheep\u2019s milk fruits. Thanks to his body, which was accustomed to farming, Shao Yunan was able to withstand such \u2018heavy\u2019 work, even without spiritual water.It was almost noon when they finished and the two baskets were full of goat milk fruit. Sitting against a tree to rest, Shao Yunan said slightly breathless, \u201cOur family must hire people in the future. This is a serious shortage of manpower.\u201d Wang Shijing wiped Shao Yunan\u2019s sweat, \u201cWhen the new house is built, we will go to the county town to find workers.\u201dShao Yunan blinked and said, \u201cThe first time I went to the city, I asked two beggars to inquire about the situation in the town. Those two beggars talked pretty well and were not greedy. How about hiring them? With a place to settle down and earn money, they should work more attentively, right?\u201dWang Shijing thought about it for a moment and finally said, \u201cWait until our new house is built. Maybe they have already gone to other places.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Shao Yunan poured some water on a handkerchief and gave it to Wang Shijing. \u201cWipe your eyes.\u201d Wang Shijing took the handkerchief and said, \u201cMy eyes have become much more comfortable these two days.\u201d\u201cThen wipe them some more and have something to eat too.\u201d\u201cEat first, I will eat after finishing wiping.\u201d The two of them sat next to each other, unlike a couple who have just been married for a few days, but more like a couple who have been together for many years. Wang Shijing\u2019s not asking questions made Shao Yunan especially relaxed and the thoughtfulness he showed without thinking also made Shao Yunan appreciate him more. As for the decision to leave after making money, has Shao Yunan even said something like this?After filling their stomachs and finishing picking all the goat milk fruits, the two of them went down the mountain. In addition to the basket, they each also carried two large cloth bags of sheep\u2019s milk fruit and wild peaches. On the way, Shao Yunan discussed with Wang Shijing about asking aunt Wang to help them clean up the fruits. It would be too tiring for the two of them to do it alone. As for Wang Qing and Wang Nizi, Shao Yunan didn\u2019t even consider it. Wang Shijing also agreed with this.After they got home smoothly, Shao Yunan went to Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house to pick up the children, while Wang Shijing went to pick up Aunt Wang. Arriving at Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house, Shao Yunan gave a small amount of the goat milk fruit as a thank you to Zhao Lizheng, since wild peaches were too sour for a gift. Zhao He, the eldest daughter-in-law of Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house, brought out the two children who were holding books and a thick pile of written paper.Zhao He said to Shao Yunan, \u201cI heard from Wang Qing, that you plan to send him to private school next year. These were the books and texts that my little Bo used at the private school, you can take them and teach from them.\u201d Shao Yunan was taken aback when Zhao Liu said affectionately, \u201cYunan, this is my eldest daughter-in-law, Zhao He. Just call him Brother He.\u201dShao Yunan reached out and gratefully accepted it, \u201cThank you, Brother He. Won\u2019t your son use them anymore?\u201dZhao He said, \u201cThis is what he learned from when he first started going to private school. He has been studying for two years now, so he no longer uses them. These books are just sitting at home and it\u2019s a pity to throw away the paper, since it was bought with money. So why not give them to Wang Qing, so he can learn in advance. This way he won\u2019t be uncomfortable when he goes to private school.\u201d\u201cThank you so much! I\u2019ll borrow these books and I\u2019ll give them back to little Bo after Wang Qing finishes with them.\u201d Shao Yunan took it and said to Wang Qing, \u201cThank you Uncle He.\u201d\u201cThank you, Uncle He.\u201d\u201cNo need to thank me.\u201d Zhao He smiled and touched Wang Qing\u2019s head. On the night of the dinner invitation, Zhao He came with Zhao Yuande. Since he was busy that day, Shao Yunan did not remember much, but now Zhao He had left a deep impression on him. Coming out of Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house, Shao Yunan was still thinking of the Zhao family\u2019s eldest daughter-in-law, who was a man. Although in the great state of Yan, marrying a male wife was not a taboo, the eldest son of the family would usually still marry a woman. After all, men were not fertile. He didn\u2019t expect that Zhao Lizheng would be so open minded.As a pure zero, Shao Yunan\u2019s good feelings towards Uncle Lizheng increased by one point.After asking what Wang Qing and Wang Nizi did today, he learned that the Wang family behaved very well today and didn\u2019t come to make trouble for the two children. The two children practiced their calligraphy at Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house, during which both Zhao Lizheng and Zhao Yuande had even given them pointers. Learning about this, Shao Yunan felt even more goodwill towards Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family. Whatever the reason for Zhao Lizheng\u2019s generosity, it was not bad for them.Not long after returning home, Wang Shijing came over with some other people. Fourth Aunt Wang, Aunt Zhou, Sun Erjiang\u2019s mother, Aunt Sun Guan, and three other aunts that Shao Yunan didn\u2019t quite remember, but who were all very honest and kind had come to help. Aunt Zhou was embarrassed to come since she hadn\u2019t finished sewing their clothes yet, but was pulled over by fourth aunt Wang, after she was invited over by Wang Shijing. Aunt Zhou was handy, just the person that Shao Yunan needed.Once they came over, Shao Yunan first thanked them gratefully and then asked them to help him with the goat milk fruits. They would each get 30 copper coins after they were done. Hearing that one person could get 30 copper coins, the six aunts even said it was too high. When you went out to work for a day, you would only earn 10 copper coins at most and sometimes you might not even be able to earn that. But earning so much money just for handling a few fruits\u2026 since they were from the same village it would only be appropriate. Shao Yunan was embarrassed to exploit these simple aunts, who usually had no other incomes. These 30 copper coins were not that different from 200 yuan (about 30 US dollars).But the aunties were all smiles as they immediately rolled up their sleeves and washed their hands in preparation for work. Wang Qing and Wang Nizi also wanted to help, but Shao Yunan just stuffed a goat milk fruit into their mouth and drove them inside the house.Shao Yunan left a small portion of the goat milk fruits to make jam and planned to use the rest to brew wine. First he poured all the goat milk fruits on the bamboo mat and sorted out the poor quality ones, as well as those that were about to ripen. After sorting and cleaning them, he spread them out to dry before he started processing the fruits. First of all, the fruit stalk had to be cleaned up and then pressed to extract as much juice as possible. The first time the fruit was squeezed it needed to have its pulp separated with fine linen cloth, before squeezing it for a second time.Shao Yunan used a stone mortar and pestle to squeeze the fruit, but the aunts and Wang Shijing used their hands to directly squeeze them. After three rounds, Shao Yunan left the juice of the first squeeze alone and then mixed the juice from the second and third squeeze together. The juice that was already filtered twice already had as few impurities as possible. After all that, it was already dark, so Shao Yunan settled the payment on the spot, because he did not want to keep the aunts for dinner.The aunts took the 30 copper coins each and left happily. Wang Shijing poured the juice into the wine barrel and then went to the kitchen to cook, since he couldn\u2019t help with the rest. The wine barrel could only be kept in the cellar for the time being. Shao Yunan closed the entrance to the cellar, but when his hand closed the door, the six wine barrels disappeared. He then entered the space.Shao Yunan found a mask in his own pile of things and put it on. He then ignited the sulfur he bought yesterday from the pharmacy. If you want the fruit wine to last longer and taste better, sulfur dioxide must be added during the fermentation of the fruit. Since he could not get ready-made sulfur dioxide here, he could only make it manually.The burning sulfur produced sulfur dioxide gas, which Shao Yunan poured into the wine barrel and sealed it according to his experience. Sulfur dioxide gas was harmful to humans, but his space had a very good purification effect. After sealing all six barrels, Shao Yunan poured a scoop of water on the burning sulfur. The pungent smell was difficult to bear even with a mask, so Shao Yunan drank two large cups of spiritual spring water and washed his face before he felt comfortable again.The first sedimentation would happen after 20 days, then from 28 to 42 days, the second one would happen, making the wine taste good. In other words, it would take at least forty-eight days before it was ready to drink and even more if you wanted it to taste good. Going back to the cellar, he took out the six barrels. Not noticing anything special, Shao Yunan left the cellar.Wang Shijing had already made the rice and fried two kinds of meat and two vegetables. Wang Shijing\u2019s skills were very ordinary, but Shao Yunan was not fussy. With a good appetite he ate two large bowls of rice, but unfortunately he could not rest yet. There was still a large round winnowing basket of wild chrysanthemums waiting for him to handle. These things were money in Shao Yunan\u2019s eyes and there was still a large area of land and a large mountain waiting for him to buy, with more than twenty ancient tea trees, he would never let others have.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 42": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fierce \u201cHusband\u201dCH 21.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 21.2Since Shao Yunan didn\u2019t go to sleep, Wang Shijing also did not sleep either. Wang Qing and Wang Nizi strongly requested to help, since father and little dad were tired. So, Shao Yunan arranged a job for the two children. They would take the dry goods that were drying in the yard inside the house and would take it out to continue to dry when they got up in the morning, until the sun set.Next, Shao Yunan concentrated on his wild chrysanthemum flowers. The wild chrysanthemum flowers needed their stems removed and cleaned. Flowers which had signs of decay would also be picked out. Shao Yunan did not let Wang Shijing help. While the villagers were still awake, he asked him to find someone to order the stone mill he had wanted before, as well as a person who would make them some steaming trays with bamboo strips. In addition, he wanted to know who was selling malt sugar and sesame, and buy some. He didn\u2019t buy enough malt sugar, but since the goat milk fruits were already sweet, there was no need to use sugar extravagantly.By the time Wang Shijing came back, Shao Yunan had already boiled a large pot of hot water and was ready to wash. Wang Shijing came back after the wild chrysanthemum was taken care of. He had bought some maltose sugar and black sesame seeds, but the steaming trays could only be picked up tomorrow morning, so he asked uncle Zhou to do it. The trays would be ready the next day at noon at the earliest, after all it was late now. The stone mill would also only be ready after several days.After two days and nights without any sleep, Shao Yunan was a little tired. Wang Shijing helped him to change the water, before going into the house to get a change of clothes for him, so he could wash his clothes first. Shao Yunan poured a drop of spiritual milk into the bucket after Wang Shijing left, then he simply washed his body, making the redness and swelling on his body that was caused by Wang Shijing instantly relieved. The most troublesome thing was washing his hair, which made Shao Yunan really want to cut off all that long hair. He could wash his body three times with the effort it took to wash only his hair.After he finally finished washing, Shao Yunan poured some more water and prepared the bath for Wang Shijing. He also added a drop of spiritual milk before entering the house. Wang Shijing was sitting on the kang in his underwear. With all the bedding laid out, there was only one quilt. Shao Yunan raised his eyebrows, but didn\u2019t comment, only saying, \u201cGo and wash up. Wipe your eyes first and then wash your body. Also soak your feet in a basin of hot water properly. Wake me up tomorrow when you wake up.\u201d\u201cGet into the bed.\u201d Wang Shijing got off the bed and went to take a bath, while Shao Yunan wiped his hair with a cloth towel, hoping that it would dry quickly. It was a pain in the ass not to have a hair dryer. He had one in his space, but he couldn\u2019t take it out to use it. Hiding the existence of the space from Wang Shijing was really inconvenient. Shao Yunan wiped his hair, while seriously thinking about the feasibility of this matter.By the time Wang Shijing came back, Shao Yunan had already laid down. Wang Shijing carried a charcoal brazier with hot charcoal inside. Going near the bed, he said, \u201cYunan, get up and dry your hair before going to sleep. It\u2019s cold and you can get sick.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to move.\u201d Shao Yunan mumbled. Wang Shijing moved the charcoal brazier to the side of the bed and then helped dry Shao Yunan\u2019s hair. \u201cIt\u2019s inconvenient to take a bath, there is no bathroom, and the rooms are too small.\u201d Someone complained while actually acting coquettish. Wang Shijing immediately said, \u201cTomorrow I will go to Zhao Lizheng\u2019s to buy a house. Then I will go to the county town to order a bath for you.\u201d\u201cForget it. I\u2019m going to see the county magistrate in a couple of days, so I\u2019ll order it then. You said that the county magistrate is surnamed Jiang, right?\u201d Shao Yunan couldn\u2019t ask the county magistrate for his name directly, but the jade plate he received had Jiang engraved on it. He guessed that the other party might be surnamed Jiang.Wang Shijing said, \u201cThe county magistrate is surnamed Jiang. I asked brother Yuande about him and he said that the county magistrate, who arrived in Yongxiu province just last year was called Jiang Kangning. I heard that he won the top position on the exam at the age of 18 and was a real child prodigy. Before he came to Yongxiu province, he had been a county magistrate in another province for several years. It is also said that he is from the capital and seems to have some kind of background. County magistrates from Yongxiu province are not simple, several of them went directly to the capital.\u201d\u201cThe dean of the county school is called Cen Yuebai. Brother Yuande said that he had been an official in the capital before and came back as the dean of the county school. He also has a private school called \u2018White Moon Academy\u2019, which is the best school in the county town. All the students from our province who could go to the capital were enrolled in White Moon Academy. Even if they cannot go to the Imperial College, students from White Moon Academy can still enter the county school after they have passed the examination as a child student, so they can continue to study in the academy and take the exams.\u201d As soon as he heard that, Shao Yunan said, \u201cThen let\u2019s send Wang Qing to White Moon Academy.\u201dWang Shijing said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy to get in. Even Wang Zhisong couldn\u2019t get in.\u201d Wang Shijing has completely separated himself from his family. \u201cTo get into White Moon Academy, first of all, you have to be talented. Second, the monthly tuition is very expensive, so ordinary families can\u2019t afford it. You have to take an exam if you want to enter the school, but if you don\u2019t do well on the exam, you won\u2019t be accepted in the academy. If you don\u2019t study hard, you will also be expelled from the academy.\u201d\u201cEven if an especially talented child from a farming family can enter, it\u2019s very rare. How can the children of poor families compare with those of rich families? They can start studying from early childhood and rich families\\ would hire a tutor for their children, so even before going to school they can already write poetry. While children who come from a farming family may not even hold a brush if they have not attended lessons. Even if someone got tutored before, at most they will only know a few words and can recite a few poems in advance.\u201dWasn\u2019t this just an elite school from ancient times? It seems that we can\u2019t win even at the starting line. No matter the era, it was still pretty much the same. \u201cI don\u2019t think Wang Zhisong is that much smarter, at most he is just a little smarter. A person\u2019s wisdom depends on his upbringing and his family environment. So how much more wisdom can he really have? It\u2019s you, who out of bad bamboo came out as a good bamboo mutation.\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s eyes immediately fleshed with a reserved smile.\u201cWang Qing is not stupid and its not too late for enlightenment\u2026 it\u2019s just in time. As long as he is not afraid of hardship and is more diligent than others, he can catch up with those who are rich. I\u2019ll teach him when we\u2019re done with the family business. If he can\u2019t go to the White Moon Academy this year, he will definitely go the year after.\u201d With spiritual water, even a complete fool could get enlightened. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can teach him.\u201d Wang Shijing could not help bowing his head to kiss Shao Yunan\u2019s hair.Everyone feels different once he becomes enlightened. Shao Yunan said, \u201cMy hair is almost dry, quickly dry your own. Then take out the charcoal pot, it is dangerous to sleep with it. It\u2019s easy to get poisoned.\u201d Touching Shao Yunan\u2019s almost dry hair, Wang Shijing dealt with his own still wet hair. He took off his shirt, loosened his wooden hairpin that tied up his hair, and started tidying up. Shao Yunan looked at Wang Shijing\u2019s hot pecs and abs and scolded, [Damn, seducing me again.]Fearing that he might be pounced on like a wolf, he could only hope that his thirst was quenched last night. Since Shao Yunan had nothing else to say, he spoke. \u201cZhao Yuande\u2019s wife, Zhao He, gave his son\u2019s books and the things he learned from to Wang Qing, saying that he could learn from them first. I just learned that Zhao Yuande married a man. It seems it might be quite good to get along.\u201dWang Shijing said, \u201cBig brother Yuande and brother He grew up together. It\u2019s just that Uncle and Aunt Zhao didn\u2019t want it much since brother Yuande is the eldest son. Uncle Zhao wanted him to marry a woman and have more children. However, Brother Yuande is a good person and doesn\u2019t mind that Brother He only had one child so far and treats him well. Brother He is also an easy person to get along with.\u201dShao Yunan wiped off the goose bumps on his body, still not quite accepting the fact that a man could have children. Then he heard Wang Shijing say, \u201cBrother Yuande and Brother He are sensible people. Since Brother He gave Qing learning materials, he also wants to make friends with us. I\u2019m afraid it is also Brother Yuande\u2019s intention. We should find a chance in the future to return their goodwill.\u201dShao Yunan said, \u201cI will naturally repay their friendship to us. I also think those two people are good. In fact, the whole Zhao Lizheng family is not bad. At least Zhao Lizheng is much more sensible than that patriarch of yours.\u201d Wang Shijing did not say anything, since he had long since lost hope for the patriarch.\u201cWho else in the village married a male wife?\u201d Shao Yunan began to gossip, while Wang Shijing accompanied him. He had been worried that Shao Yunan did not like his status as a male wife. But now hearing him mention other male wives, while looking normal, Wang Shijing was relieved. Especially after last night\u2019s passion. Shao Yunan\u2019s voice dropped so low at one point that Wang Shijing also stopped talking. Taking the charcoal pot outside, Wang Shijing closed the door, blew out the oil lamp, and took off his pants, wearing only underwear before getting into the bed.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shao Yunan\u2019s body felt so good to touch. Once he touched him, Wang Shijing lost some control. The swollen nipples that he sucked just last night had gone down, but Wang Shijing\u2019s own desires overwhelmed him as he took a mouthful of them, making Shao Yunan scream.\u201cI have no milk!\u201d So vigorous! Unexpectedly, Shao Yunan\u2019s words only stimulated Wang Shijing. He ripped off Shao Yunan\u2019s pants and took a hold of him. The sucking sound was heavy alongside Shao Yunan\u2019s moaning. Shao Yunan\u2019s naked legs wrapped around Wang Shijing\u2019s waist. This body, which was even smaller than his original, was very eager to be filled with something.\u201cMy wife will need to bear with me again.\u201d Wang Shijing held the two hard objects and rubbed them together, making Shao Yunan cry. Telling him to put up with it\u2026 ah! \u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable, I\u2019m uncomfortable down there!\u201d Wang Shijing also did not expect Shao Yunan\u2019s body to be so sensitive, but Shao Yunan was still young and his place had not been used before, so he was afraid that doing that prematurely would hurt Shao Yunan\u2019s body.Kissing Shao Yunan\u2019s mouth, Wang Shijing\u2019s other hand explored Shao Yunan\u2019s crevice. His thumb gently rubbed against the untouched chrysanthemum. Immediately after, Wang Shijing\u2019s back instantly tingled. Shao Yunan\u2019s place was actually wet! A fine bead of sweat gushed out his rear, as Wang Shijing\u2019s thumb pushed a little harder and surprisingly went in. Shao Yunan hummed in pleasure and rubbed his right leg on Wang Shijing\u2019s body, asking him to go in a little deeper.So soft, so warm\u2026 Wang Shijing\u2019s thumb was almost sucked in as layers of tender flesh cheerfully wrapped around him. If Wang Shijing was more experienced, he would definitely notice that Shao Yunan\u2019s body was simply the best and extremely good. After two thrusts, Wang Shijing withdrew his thumb and replaced it with his index finger. Then he quickly inserted his middle finger again. Shao Yunan\u2019s screams were full of comfort, as well as a few complaints.\u201cWife, be patient, you are young. When you grow a little, I will give you everything. I will give you everything.\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s sweat dripped down as he held the two hard things in his hand. While the two fingers of his other hand were in Shao Yunan\u2019s erogenous zone pumping. This double stimulation and dissatisfaction made Shao Yunan go from screams to cries, making tears almost come out. With a little moisture, Wang Shijing with his thick calloused fingers did not hurt Shao Yunan, but gave him a different kind of pleasure.On a quiet night, the heat in the house was hot enough to make even coldblooded people agitated. The hot liquid wet both of Wang Shijing\u2019s hands, as his freshly washed body was covered with a certain smell. Shao Yunan cried out and came on Wang Shijing\u2019s hands, while feeling the same pleasure from his rear. Wang Shijing was also stimulated and came at almost the same time as Shao Yunan. Shao Yunan\u2019s tears were still flowing, while the intense afterglow made him unable to resist still moaning. Wang Shijing got out of the bed and found two clean towels to clean both of them up.Nestled in Wang Shijing\u2019s naked arms, Shao Yunan\u2019s body was still trembling slightly. Wang Shijing gently stroked his body through his clothes time after time, his one eye filled with happiness and gratitude that Shao Yunan didn\u2019t see. This was the happiness that Wang Shijing has been longing for, for more than twenty years, which was brought to him by this teenager named Shao Yunan, who was full of secrets.\u201cAre you sure you haven\u2019t touched a man before?\u201d Shao Yunan did not think that Wang Shijing had figured out these means with his ex-wife. Wang Shijing said with a low muffled voice due to lust, \u201cThere are many brothers in the army, sometimes it is inevitable that you would come across them doing that. Before each big battle, not knowing whether they would come back alive the next day, many of them did it in the tents.\u201d\u201cYou also couldn\u2019t hold back?\u201d Wang Shijing was silent. Shao Yunan\u2019s heart sank as he pinched Wang Shijing\u2019s waist. \u201d Don\u2019t say you still have a few \u2018good\u2019 brothers!\u201d Wang Shijing pressed Shao Yunan\u2019s hand and said somewhat evasively, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be happy. I knew that as soon as I left home, Song and the two children would have a hard time so how could I find good brothers?\u201dShao Yunan let it go. \u201cI am not so petty. Also don\u2019t mention your ex-wife in front of me again. Or do you like her so much that you are avoiding it?\u201d Wang Shijing immediately said, \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for you, I would have been like this my whole life. I didn\u2019t have any intention to think about what I like or not.\u201d After a moment of silence, Wang Shijing continued, \u201cI\u2019d been with Song for a total of only two years and that thing adds up to less than two hands.\u201dShao Yunan was so surprised that he raised his head from Wang Shijing\u2019s arm. \u201cAre you sure? I take it your ex-wife simply couldn\u2019t stand your raging desire and took the opportunity to run away!\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s face burned a little in the darkness, but he had to answer.\u201cIt was inconvenient to live with my family, so I was not in the mood often while Song was afraid of pain and didn\u2019t like it.\u201d Shao Yunan\u2026 \u201cSure enough. She couldn\u2019t stand you so she took the first opportunity to run away.\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s one eye sank as he lowered his head to seek Shao Yunan\u2019s mouth and kissed him. Whether Song likes it or not has nothing to do with him. He liked what he liked, Shao Yunan was not a shy person. Touching Wang Shijing\u2019s flesh through his underwear\u2026 this guy from top to the bottom wanted to seduce him!After a short rest, the fire was ignited again. Faced with Shao Yunan, who did not know what shyness and reserve were in this area, Wang Shijing also realized that his desires could be strong. He really wanted to break into that enchanting place to unrestrainedly explore it. But he put up with it again and again at the thought of someone in the army who had been hurt by doing it prematurely. He could stand it for two years.When Wang Qing and Wang Nizi got up, their two fathers were still asleep, so the two children, moving silently, made breakfast in cooperation. Hearing a knock on the door, Wang Qing ran to open it. But first he looked through the door to see who it was before he opened it.\u201cGrandpa Zhou.\u201d The man who came was Uncle Zhou. He then asked, \u201cIs your father at home? The stuff he asked me to make is ready.\u201d Wang Qing said, \u201cMy father is not up yet, he worked till late last night. I\u2019ll tell him when he gets up.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Uncle Zhou handed ten bamboo steamer trays to Wang Qing and left.Wang Shijing woke up when Uncle Zhou knocked on the door. Lifting the cover, he gently came out of the bedding, then tucked in Shao Yunan, who was still asleep, before getting off the bed and getting dressed. While dressing, Wang Shijing kept looking at Shao Yunan\u2019s neck, which had several marks left by him. The more he looked at them, the more satisfied he became.When Wang Shijing left the room, he immediately signaled the two children to keep their voices down. Wang Qing and Wang Nizi learned that their little father was tired and still sleeping, so they went back inside to practice their writing.\u00a0 Wang Shijing wiped his eyes and after washing, he hurriedly ate breakfast and went to give the money to Uncle Zhou. Uncle Zhou made the steamers so quickly, he must have stayed up late last night, so he gave him more money.After he gave the money to Uncle Zhou, with an additional 20 copper coins, Wang Shijing went to Zhao Lizheng\u2019s to buy land. He not only wanted to buy the land at the foot of the western hills, he also wanted to buy ten acres of mountain land, which was unbelievable to Zhao Lizheng. The land there was not only remote, it was also bad. It was not that there was no particularly good land left in the village, there is a large area of middle and lower quality land available. So he couldn\u2019t understand Wang Shijing\u2019s decision to let go of this good land, only to buy mountain land. Zhao Lizheng also did not ask him if he had enough money, since he came there, he must have enough money.Wang Shijing only said Shao Yunan liked it there and that the mountain land could be reclaimed in time for the farming season. This would allow him to buy more land, when he has more money. Besides, mountain land was very cheap and since their home would be at the foot of the mountain, it would also be convenient to do work there. Since Wang Shijing already made up his mind, Zhao Lizheng stopped trying to persuade him.This was far away from Wang Dali\u2019s family\u2019s fields, so he estimated that the couple wanted to have some peace and quiet.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After confirming the land he wanted to buy, he measured it again. Although the location was remote and the land location was mountainous, he would not need to pay taxes for mountainous land for a year. In addition, the land for the house was also next to the foot of the mountain. Adding it all up, it was almost a hundred taels of silver, not counting the money for building the house. If Shao Yunan did not go to the county school to make such a scene, old lady Wang would have made another scene just from looking at the money Wang Shijing spent on his new home.Shao Yunan had already bought the land and the mountain, so he could block the only way up the mountain. Wang Shijing told Zhao Lizheng that they were also going to buy the dilapidated house they currently lived in. Including the open space at the front and the back of the house, it would cost another 20 to 30 taels of silver. Spending so much money at once, Zhao Yuande couldn\u2019t help asking why he had already bought such a large piece of land. Wang Shijing could only say that he would save it for later, when Wang Qing grew up and wanted to separate from them, so there would be a place for him.Zhao Lizheng and Zhao Yuande could only say that they were really thinking for the long term, as they measured the area. After measuring the area, they will go to the Yamen in the afternoon and the land could be officially measured by the people in the Land Department. After handing over the money, they would also get the deed for the land. After they were finished, someone came to find Zhao Lizheng, saying that the head of the Shao family village came and was looking for him and Shao Yunan. Before going home and seeing Shao\u00a0 Yunan, Wang Shijing followed Zhao Lizheng.By the time Wang Shijing returned, Shao Yunan was already up. He would meet the county magistrate the next day, so he couldn\u2019t go empty handed. The tea and wine still needed some time, so the fastest thing was jam. As soon as Wang Shijing returned, he got busy and didn\u2019t mention what happened at Zhao Lizheng\u2019s. The leftover goat milk fruits were first washed, dried, peeled, and cut by Wang Shijing, Wang Qing, and Nizi, while Shao Yunan did the last step.While Wang Shijing and the two children were busy with the jam, Shao Yunan began to steam the wild chrysanthemums. The bamboo steamer trays were not big, so only twelve chrysanthemums were arranged neatly in each steamer tray. Adding a little water to a large iron pot, he put the three steamer trays into the pot after the water started boiling and put the lid on. The intensity of the fire was high. so the steaming time was only four to five minutes. It might sound simple, but this operation was also difficult to grasp, otherwise the flower would be either raw, or overcooked.Both sides did meticulous work. When Wang Shijing\u2019s side finished, Shao Yunan\u2019s side had also almost finished steaming. The steamed chrysanthemums were put on a bamboo mat and spread out in the sun. After three days, they could be turned over and baked in the sun for another three days. It would take a total of seven days. After that, they would be stored for a few days according to the temperature and humidity, before being taken out to bake in the sun for another two days. This ensured that they would be thoroughly dried out for preservation and future usage.Although the temperature had dropped, the sun was still good, so the work of sun drying was taken over by Wang Qing and Wang Nizi. Shao Yunan could be rest assured, leaving it to them. Both Wang Qing and Wang Nizi knew it was necessary to earn money and took care of it with special dedication.After the chrysanthemums were dried, Shao Yunan started making jam. Pouring the cut pulp into the pot, he added some water to cover the pulp, then stirred it with a spoon and removed the foam. Shao Yunan called Wang Nezi to his side and asked her to follow and learn. Jam was a good thing to know how to make. As long as you wanted to eat it, it could be made from any fruit. The method was also the same and could be changed according to different tastes. For girls with nothing to do, making jam could also increase their interest in life.Wang Shijing and Wang Qing went to pack the picked peaches. The peaches were small and sour, so they couldn\u2019t be eaten directly, but Shao Yunan still wanted to make them into a jam. Goat milk fruits were sour and sweet, so Shao Yunan did not add too much malt sugar, only a few sour plums to enhance the flavor. If the jam was too sweet, it would not be delicious. When the pot gurgled, Wang Nizi began to gulp, smelling something sweet and fragrant\u2026 it must be delicious. In the courtyard, Wang Qing also smelled something sweet.The mixture began to get sticky, so Shao Yunan brought a stone mortar and pestle and began to stir, while grinding the chunks of fruit pulp into mush. When the jam was ready. Shao Yunan asked Wang Nizi to stop the fire in time and then shouted outside. \u201cShijing, bring the small clay pots I bought yesterday.\u201dWang Shijing went to get the jars, while Wang Qing ran into the kitchen. Shao Yunan took a spoon and scooped up a little bit to feed Wang Nizi first. After a taste, Wang Nizi\u2019s eyes rounded. \u201cLittle father, it\u2019s delicious!\u201d Sweet food was a luxury, not to mention jam that has never been available before. Shao Yunan also gave Wang Qing a taste. Wang Qing also nodded his head in agreement that it was delicious! Sour and sweet, it tasted even better than eating a goat milk fruit directly!\u201cThe jam is an add-on and can be eaten with snacks or steamed buns. At noon, little father will make some egg pancakes so you can try it.\u201d The best match was bread of course, but they had to wait until their new house was built with a special oven. \u201cMm-hmm.\u201d\u201cPack these up first, cool them and then seal them. Little father will continue to make peach jam.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe two children felt very happy. Shao Yunan didn\u2019t plan to make much money with the jam. The things that would make money were stored in the cellar. Not even the sesame paste he had thought of before. After the tea was made and the mountain bought as a cover, Shao Yunan no longer had these intentions. He made the jam for his family, as well as to gift to the people who helped him in the past, like Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family, Aunt Wang\u2019s family, Aunt Zhou\u2019s family, Sun Erjiang\u2019s family, Wang Zhuanghua, who has a good relationship with Wang Shijing, as well as the county magistrate Jiang, Dean Cen, the two teachers from the county school, and the gatekeeper Zhuang.Shao Yunan asked Wang Shijing to send some to Wang Wenhe, as well the other two clan elders of the Wang family. Wang Wenhe was stubborn, but Wang Shuping was a good person. Besides, can Wang Wenhe be the patriarch of the clan all his life? As long as Wang Shijing was in Xiushui Village, it was impossible to completely break away from the Wang clan.After that, there wasn\u2019t much of the goat milk jam left, making Wang Qing and Wang Nizi a little distressed. How much money could they make if they sold it? They have never heard of such a delicious jam. Shao Yunan took the opportunity to educate the two children. The jam could indeed be sold for money and it was estimated that it would not be cheap. After all, it was the first time such a product was sold. But some things cannot be measured by money.Living in a village, you cannot be too alone. You need to have good friends, so that you can live comfortably. Other people will also be more willing to help, if they have someone on their side. The jam was a rare item, so giving it away will also give them more face and whoever receives it will receive a favor. In the future, there will be a lot of trouble with the people in the village. If you want them to be willing to help you and stand up for you, you must first show your sincerity. You have to be willing to give up something, so that you might also gain something. The jam was a good thing, but people may figure out how to make it after looking at it. Using this method exclusively for too long was not possible, so there\u2019s no need to worry about it.The two children understood and no longer felt sorry about it. There were many goat milk fruits on the mountain, they could always go and pick some themselves later. Since they had not picked many peaches, Shao Yunan only sent the peach jam to county magistrate Jiang, Dean Cen, and the two teachers, Guan and Chen. When they return from the Yamen tomorrow, it would not be too late to go up the mountain and pick more peaches.Scooping out the goat\u2019s milk jam and putting it aside, Shao Yunan washed the pot and started making the peach jam. The steps were the same, but the peach kernel needed to be taken out and more malt sugar needed to be added. If it was still too sour, he would need to add some rock sugar.At noon Shao Yunan took out the rutabaga. Wang Shijing did not ask about his secret even after seeing the rutabaga. Wang Shijing and his two children liked eating very much and almost all the food they ate these days was a gift from other families. Shao Yunan discussed with Wang Shijing about reclaiming a piece of land for a vegetable garden in his own yard. The mountain land should be cleaned up first and fertilized. Since it was difficult to grow anything at this time of year, he would consider planting more food the next year andWang Shijing agreed.The busy work period was almost finished, so Shao Yunan won\u2019t be busy for long, even if he wanted to collect some more goat milk fruits and tea. Planting vegetables, future watering, and harvesting work could also be completely handed over to Wang Qing and Wang Nizi. Watering their own land, harvesting their own vegetables, Wang Qing\u2019s and Wang Nizi\u2019s enthusiasm was very high.After eating, the goat milk fruit, and peach jam were already cold. Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing bottled them, while Wang Qing and Wang Nizi washed dishes. The two moved separately as they delivered the jam, with Shao Yunan going to Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house first. Since Zhao He took the initiative to show goodwill, he should also show something. With this back and forth, their friendship could deepen.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhao Yuande and Zhao Yuanqing were not separated and had a good relationship. Zhao Yuanqing just got married last year. Li Caijuan, his wife, was from the Li family, one of the big families of Lijia Village. Li Caijuan could also be regarded as virtuous. Since Zhao He was also a man, the two daughters-in-law did not compete for anything.Zhao Yuanqing had no children, so the family\u2019s only grandchild was Zhao Congbo, which was also the main reason for Zhao Lizheng\u2019s wife\u2019s dissatisfaction. Zhao Congbo was already ten years old, so it might not be possible for Zhao He to have another child. So all hopes of making their family grow bigger were placed on the belly of the new daughter-in-law, but even after being married for a year there was still no news, making the old couple worry.All members of Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family except Zhao Congbo, who was studying at the private school, were all present. When Shao Yunan dropped by, Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family were very kind. Seeing Shao Yunan carrying a jar and a heavy cloth bag in his arms, Zhao Lizheng asked first, \u201cDon\u2019t bring things every time you come, why are you so polite?\u201d Zhao Lizheng\u2019s wife, Zhao Liu also said, \u201cYou and Shijing bring things every time you come, making me and your Uncle embarrassed. He is the head of the village, so he should help you out.\u201dZhao Yuande and Zhao Yuanqing also said not to act so politely all the time. Shao Yunan took a seat next to Zhao He and said casually. \u201cThat\u2019s because I have a good relationship with Uncle Zhao and Aunt Zhao, so I brought some things. You won\u2019t be seeing me going to the Wang family.\u201d When he said this, Zhao Lizheng didn\u2019t know what to say, but Zhao Liu just laughed suddenly and was very happy because of Shao Yunan\u2019s coaxing. Shao Yunan put down the things in his hand and said, \u201cThere are some chestnuts in this sack, I picked them up in the mountains and there are more at home. You can use them for cooking porridge and stew. Fried with sugar they also make a good snack. Since Zhao Congbo is studying at school you might let him take it to the private school to share it with the little ones to deepen their relationship.\u201dHearing this, Zhao He\u2019s eyes brightened. Zhao He only has one son, Zhao Congbo, so he always thinks of his son first. Zhao Lizheng and Zhao Liu also thought it was a good idea. Then Shao Yunan said, \u201cIn this jar is my homemade goat milk fruit jam, please try it.\u201d After saying that, Shao Yunan opened the seal and a sweet aroma came out. Shao Yunan asked Zhao Liu to bring a spoon and a bowl over and Zhao Liu quickly brought them. Six people all looked at the jam, what was jam? Why did it smell so good?Shao Yunan scooped out two tablespoons of jam and handed it out. \u201cHave a taste.\u201d Zhao Liu carefully took a small mouthful and was amazed. \u201cIt\u2019s delicious! What kind of fruit is this goat milk fruit?\u201d Zhao Yuanqing was so impatient that he took the spoon from his mother\u2019s hand, also tasted the jam, then immediately stuffed it into his wife\u2019s mouth, which caused Zhao Lizheng to kick him. After all six people had tasted it, they all said it was delicious. Shao Yunan then explained, \u201cThis goat milk fruit is the red sour fruit on the mountain.\u201d\u201cThis is made from red sour fruits?\u201d Everyone exclaimed. Shao Yunan nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s made from the red sour fruits. This fruit looks like a goat, so in some places it\u2019s called goat milk fruit. Uncle Zhao, I picked these goat milk fruits in the west mountain and almost finished picking all of them. Wang Shijing and I didn\u2019t dare to go deeper, but there should also be different mountains and it\u2019s not difficult to make. It should also be east to sell, if Uncle Zhao is willing I can teach the craft to brother He.\u201dWhen Shao Yunan said this, not to mention Zhao He, even Zhao Lizheng was stunned. With his eyes wide open, he shook his head repeatedly. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. That\u2019s not possible. That\u2019s your craft!\u201d Shao Yunan said, \u201cUncle Zhao, this jam is not difficult to make, but the process is a bit troublesome. In my family there are only two people who can do it, me and Shijing. I\u2019m going to send Wang Qing to a private school and I\u00a0 am teaching him how to write at home. Wang Nezi is also still young, so I can\u2019t make much of it even if I wanted to sell it. There are also many things to do at home, so I really don\u2019t have energy to spare. All these fruits were left to Aunt Wang to clean up.\u201cIn fact, I also have my own selfishness. If you go to collect the goat milk fruits and start selling them, I also have other uses for it. To tell you the truth, this jam should be sold freshly. It\u2019s easy to make, so there is also no guarantee that no one else will figure it out. When others figure it out, you also won\u2019t be able to sell it for too much money. Maybe just enough to earn some pocket money.\u201d Zhao Lizheng was still unwilling. \u201cEven a small amount is still money. This is something we can not take.\u201dShao Yunan simply said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want it I will give it to someone else. Even my Nezi can do it.\u201d Zhao Yuande spoke up at this time. \u201cFather, since Shao Yunan took the initiative and is willing to teach us, this really might earn a lot of money. Shao Yunan might not say it, but he also needs our help to collect red sour fruit, since the jam has other uses. The earnings from the jam we sell can be divided equally with Yunan.\u201d\u201cYes, father, our two families can share.\u201d Zhao Yuanqing was also moved. Zhao He and Li Caijuan were also moved, but they were wives, so they could not interrupt casually at this time. Shao Yunan said without even thinking about it, \u201cThere is no need to divide it. I already told Uncle Zhao that I have other ways to earn money. If I can do it well, I will make a lot of money so I really don\u2019t care about the money made from selling this jam. I also really don\u2019t have the energy to do it. You don\u2019t have to split it with me. There are a lot of places to spend money for Zhao Congbo\u2019s future and if Wang Yuanqing has a son, Uncle Zhao must also send him to school.\u201dZhao Yuanqing and Li Caijuan were embarrassed. Li Caijuan was also anxious, but she couldn\u2019t have a child because of her anxiety. Zhao Liu secretly pinched Zhao Lizheng\u2019s arm to make him agree. Zhao Lizheng finally said, \u201cIf I don\u2019t give you your share, I will not feel comfortable earning this money.\u201dShao Yunan smiled. \u201cThen 10%. If Uncle Zhao feels uneasy, why don\u2019t you use some money to buy land after you earn it, or save it as public money. There are many places in our village that require spending money. In the future, when my business is up and running, Wang Shijing and I will also have to give back to the village. With you, Uncle Zhao, taking the lead, the villagers will also learn that they can earn money as long as they are not too stingy. In this way, Xiushui Village will become only better and better in the future.\u201dZhao Lizheng\u2019s eyes burned. Shao Yunan\u2019s words spoke to his heart, so he just slapped his right leg and said, \u201cGood! You and Wang Shijing, I will accept!\u201d The others immediately smiled, but Shao Yunan just said, \u201cUncle Zhao, take advantage of the busy farming period to see how much goat milk fruits you can get. You can also look in the other villages. Wild peaches can also be made into peach jam, so you can collect them too. When I pick up some more, let brother He come to me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhao He immediately answered. \u201cYunan, thank you so much!\u201d\u201cNo need for thanks. Wang Shijing and I would like to thank Uncle Zhao and Brother Yuande.\u201d Shao Yunan was a man and his status was that of Wang Shijing\u2019s male wife, so it was most appropriate for him to teach Zhao He. Zhao He was so happy that he couldn\u2019t stop smiling.After telling everyone what to pay attention to when harvesting the fruits, Shao Yunan left. As soon as he left, the Zhao family was abuzz with excitement. Each person carefully tasted the jam. The more they looked at it, the more they thought it could be sold for a lot of money. Zhao He, who was smart, immediately realized. \u201cFather, mother, this red sour fruit can be made into jam, but there are also other wild fruits on the mountain. Apricot, plum and others should also be able to be made into jam. Shao Yunan said that jam could also be made from peaches\u2026\u201dZhao Yuande said, \u201cI think so.\u201d Zhao Yuanqing immediately said, \u201cThen isn\u2019t it like we learned several crafts, so we can earn money several times a year.\u201d\u201cLook at you!\u201d Zhao Lizheng\u2019s expression was stern, but his eyes could not hide his excitement. Zhao Liu snorted coldly. \u201cThat old woman called Shao Yunan an evil star, but let\u2019s see how she will cry later.\u201d\u201cShe is really blind.\u201d Zhao Lizheng did not bother to mention the rest of the family. Li Caijuan said, \u201cFather, mother, Yuanqing and I will go back to my mother\u2019s family\u2019s house to pick more fruits. There are many red cranberries and wild peach trees on our side of the mountain.\u201d Zhao Yuanqing was a man who went along with the wind. \u201cLet\u2019s pack up and go back.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush?\u201d Zhao Lizheng told Zhao Yuanqing to sit down and said, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything about the jam in advance. Just talk about collecting the fruit. When the jam is made and really sold, our family will discuss it. If we make money, we can\u2019t hide it from the people in the village and since I am the head of the village, I am afraid it might also attract some gossip.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When the time comes, let\u2019s find Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan. Yunan has a lot of ideas. \u201d Zhao He said, \u201cFather, Shao Yunan asked us to take out the money to buy public land. I\u2019m also afraid of this point. If we earn money and give it back to the village, what might other people say. Besides, with Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan\u2019s character, if they were willing to give us a way to earn money, other people close to their family like fourth Aunt Wang will also not be ignored. In my opinion all the families with good relations in our village, who have a good relationship with Wang Shijing might find a way to earn money. For those who were greedy and didn\u2019t help when Wang Shijing was in trouble, they have nothing to say.\u201dZhao Yuande nodded. \u201cWhat He said is reasonable. Dad, don\u2019t worry too much. No matter what you say, you are the village head. If you make money, we can pay people to collect the fruit in the future.\u201d Zhao Liu could not listen to it anymore, pinched Zhao Lizheng and said, \u201cYou worry too much. This time we should listen to our children. Yuanqing, you and Caijuan will go to Lijia Village and collect as much as you can. When you pass Lijia Village, go to your grandfather\u2019s house and ask your Uncle to also collect as much as possible. I\u2019ll get you the money later. Zhao He, ask your father and your mother to go to Shanyang Village to collect too, while you and Yuande go to the nearby mountains to see if you can still pick some.\u201d\u201cYes, mother.\u201d Zhao He was adopted from Shanyang Village, so Zhao He\u2019s mother\u2019s family was from Shanyang Village. Zhao Liu\u2019s mother was also from Shanyang Village, so when she made the arrangement Zhao Lizheng didn\u2019t object. Zhao Liu went inside the room and took out some money, giving both Zhao Yuanqing and Zhao He a share. If they wanted Zhao He\u2019s parents\u2019 help, they needed to give them some money first. Zhao Yuanqing and Li Caijuan packed up and left immediately, while Zhao He and Zhao Yuande took the baskets and also left.After Shao Yunan said a few words, the entire Zhao family became busy. Zhao He was indeed a smart one. The jam making method was given to Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family, while Shao Yunan also made arrangements for the other families. If his tea business goes according to his plan, it would be easy for the whole Xiushui village to get rich. He was also not naive enough to think that old lady Wang would let it go. He also wanted to make old lady Wang\u2019s family regret it, so that even if Wang Zhisong achieved first place, he couldn\u2019t do anything to their family. However, it was not good to look down on Wang Zhisong. After all, first place was not just a dream.Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family was busy, while those who received the jam sent by Wang Shijing were happy or had mixed feelings. Of course, the majority of them were happy. It was Wang Wenhe\u2019s family that had mixed feelings. Wang Shijing did not enter the house at all, he just\u00a0 called Wang Shuping outside directly and gave him the jam, saying that it was made by his wife and asked Wang Shuping to give the children a taste while it was still fresh. Then without saying much more, Wang Shijing left.Wang Shuping opened the jar and scooped out a little of the jam. Not to mention his surprise from the taste, this jam thing was already unheard of and unseen. Wang Wenhe was determined not to eat it, but others liked it very much. Wang Wenhe\u2019s wife, Wang Qian, got angry and said to Wang Wenhe, \u201cMerit, merit! You\u2019re counting on Wang Zhisong to earn you fame and fortune all day long! You might as well count on brother Yan! With how shrewd old lady Wang is, let\u2019s see if Wang Zhisong will be willing to share it after earning it! You only know how to favor them and protect them, but what have they ever sent you? Not a single grain of rice. Not to mention that every year when it\u2019s the busy farming period, they ask other families for help, but have they ever said thank you? Do you really have no idea how much the people in the clan complained?\u201d\u201cSince Shijing came back, he has never come empty handed when he comes to visit us. Even if something is rare or precious, he sent it over. If you ask me, everyone in old lady Wang\u2019s family except Wang Shijing are just a bunch of wolves! You should go ahead and enjoy your Wang Zhisong! I\u2019d like to see if he can earn you reputation! Earn you face! Why don\u2019t you just adopt Wang Zhisong as your son and I\u2019ll live with Wang Shuping?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Wang Wenhe was both angry and ashamed. He naturally hoped that his grandson would be successful in the future, but it was not easy to even get a place in the examination. His grandson Wang Yan was not as smart as Wang Zhisong and his studying result was very average. Wang Qian ignored him and said to her son, \u201cThis jam is really rare, save it for when Wang Yan comes back so we can eat it together.\u201dWang Shuping\u2019s youngest daughter, Wang Yiting, pouted. \u201cGrandma, I want to eat, too.\u201dWangQian pinched her granddaughter\u2019s nose. \u201cWait for your brother to come back and eat it together.\u201d Not much jam was given and after giving it to several people, there wasn\u2019t much left. Wang Qian\u2019s most beloved grandchild was Wang Yan. Wang Yan was the same age as Zhao Congbo and was studying in the same private school in the county town, so he would only return in the afternoon.Wang Qian greeted her son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter, leaving only the stubborn old man alone. Wang Wenhe was angry with Wang Shijing, because he felt that Shao Yunan should not have made a scene and disgraced his clan, and because Wang Shijing\u2019s nonchalant attitude made him lose face. Wang Wenhe sat alone and sulked. He was dedicated to the Wang clan, was there something wrong with that?Wang Shuping went to his vegetable garden to pick some vegetables and send them to Wang Shijing\u2019s family. Wang Shuping knew that he couldn\u2019t get through to his own father, so he stopped persuading him for the time being. But he still had his own ideas. He didn\u2019t like Wang Zhisong in the first place, but now he hated him even more. Whether it was Wang Zhisong\u2019s performance in the county school of putting all the blame on his own mother or after he came back, not saying anything to his own family and just going inside his room to cry. Wang Zhisong returned the day before yesterday, but he hasn\u2019t seen anyone yet. It was best to stay away from such ungrateful, greedy, and selfish people. It was still not too late to get the upper hand. Old lady Wang once said that when Wang Zhisong passed the examination he would help the clan and his father foolishly believed it.When Wang Shuping came to deliver the food, Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan were very enthusiastic. Wang Shuping also made amends for his own father\u2019s sake and told them that his father asked him to go to the Yamen to ask how much money was needed to redeem Wang Tianyan and Wang Guo. But the county magistrate said that the two of them had pleaded for a lighter sentence, so they could not be redeemed. Wang Shuping also told them privately that it was lucky that they could not be redeemed or else old lady Wang would have to find Wang Shijing again to make trouble about money.Wang Shuping\u2019s action made Shao Yunan feel even better about him. Wang Shuping and Zhao Yuande were similar in some ways. When Wang Shuping saw that there were a lot of things drying in the courtyard, including wild chrysanthemum, he casually asked about it.\u00a0 Shao Yunan only said that he had picked them on the mountain and dried them to eat later. Wang Shuping did not stay long and soon left.Then Wang Shijing suddenly said, \u201cShao Yunan, you, Qing, and Nizi are not part of the family tree. I\u2019ll look for the clan elders and fourth Uncle Wang, with Wang Shuping\u2019s help the patriarch must agree.\u201d Wang Qing and Wang Nizi lowered their heads and both children bit their lips. Shao Yunan also looked reluctant. \u201cCan I not enter? I want to vomit when I think of having my name written next to those people\u2019s.\u201d Wang Qing looked up. \u201cFather, I also don\u2019t want to enter.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to enter either.\u201d Wang Nizi also voiced out. Wang Shijing looked at the two children and Wang Qing clenched his fist. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be part of the family tree!\u201d There were tears in Wang Nizi\u2019s eyes, making Shao Yunan frown as he hugged the two children and asked, \u201cQing is\u00a0 something wrong? Tell little father and little father will make the decision for you. You and Nizi will not enter if you don\u2019t want to enter.\u201dWang Qing clenched his mouth and didn\u2019t speak, while Wang Nizi just whimpered and cried. Shao Yunan stroked the heads of the two children and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, now no one can bully you. Tell little father what happened? Don\u2019t be afraid, little father won\u2019t be mad.\u201d Wang Qing still did not say anything, but Wang Nizi jumped into the arms of her little father, crying as she spoke. \u201cGrandma told second Uncle and second Aunt that if father died, they would sell me. She said that I was only a waste of money. When my brother grew up he could be sent as the family\u2019s mandatory labor or for military service. They said it would be a waste of food if he stayed at home and this way they could save money. Auntie said that I would earn more money when I got older and sold to a rich family as a concubine. Dad, I don\u2019t want to be in the genealogy.\u201dIn Wang Nizi\u2019s opinion, being in the family tree meant that she had to be with those people. She didn\u2019t want that! Shao Yunan\u2019s face was dark and Wang Shijing\u2019s muscles were also tense. If they weren\u2019t his own mother, his own brother, his own sister, he would have taken a knife and killed them! Wang Shijing kept breathing deeply, but could not suppress the anger in his chest. Shao Yunan couldn\u2019t resist giving Wang Nizi a kiss on top of her head and hugging Wang Qing with his other hand. \u201dWe don\u2019t need to be a part of the genealogy. In the future, if it is possible, we will move your father out of the clan, so that our family will be completely separated from the Wang family.\u201d\u201cQing, Nizi, little father promised you that no one would bully you. Little father will not only let you live a good life, but also let you live a good life that everyone envies. Please remember these things in your heart. Later when you have the opportunity to retaliate, little father will absolutely not stop you. In the future, when you see that family, don\u2019t even pay attention to them. Other people can say what they like. \u201cWang Nizi burst into tears. \u201cLittle father, I don\u2019t care about them. I hate them. They beat me and my brother, and made my brother do a lot of work while not feeding us. My cousin bullied me, but when I cried, grandmother only scolded me. When my brother accidentally touched his book, they beat him with a stick. My grandmother also beat him and made him kneel on the floor all night. They also always said that father is dead and that both father and mother didn\u2019t want my brother and me anymore.\u201d\u201cThose sons of bit*hes!\u201d Shao Yunan couldn\u2019t help swearing in front of the children, while Wang Shijing stood up and walked out angrily. Shao Yunan let go of Wang Nizi to grab him.\u201cI\u2019m going to ask them if I was born to them or not.\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s eyes were red with anger. Wang Nizi and Wang Qing were crying as Shao Yunan pulled Wang Shijing back into the house and told the two children to come over too.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His appearance frightened Wang Nizi and Wang Qing, so the two children cried as they hid behind their little father\u2019s back. \u201cShijing take a deep breath, don\u2019t hold it in. Don\u2019t hold it in.\u201d Shao Yunan was also a bit scared. Despite the fact that the children were nearby, he hugged Wang Shijing, kissed him on the face, kissed his chin, kissed his neck, and rubbed his chest with his hands. \u201cShijing exhale, breathe in, breathe out\u2026\u201d\u201cFather, father\u2026\u201d Wang Shijing suddenly, vigorously hugged Shao Yunan. Shao Yunan gritted his teeth to hold back a cry. Wang Shijing was so strong that his ribs were about to be broken. As he slowly exhaled, Shao Yunan kissed Wang Shijing\u2019s chin. \u201cShijing, don\u2019t be angry. Your anger will only hurt me and the children. It is not too late for a gentleman to take revenge after ten years, so we can afford to wait. What they owe you, sooner or later we will get it back with interest.\u201dWang Qing swore, \u201cDad, I will study hard. In the future, I will take the top spot and become a high-ranking official, so they will never dare to bully us again.\u201d Wang Shijing reached out and hugged the two children together with Shao Yunan. Calming down, he did not speak for a long time. Shao Yunan kept rubbing his chest, while also vowing in his heart.In the evening, Shao Yunan cooked a big meal to make up to the wronged children and the angry Wang Shijing. Stewed chicken with chestnut, egg cake with jam, fried meat mushrooms, fried mushrooms, and for dessert sweet-scented osmanthus soup. The two children\u2019s moods recovered after eating the delicious meal they had never eaten before. Wang Shijing also ate a lot, but he was still obviously in a bad mood.After crying, Wang Nizi and her little father grew closer, so after the meal she licked her lips and said, \u201cDaddy, will you teach me how to cook? Daddy\u2019s cooking is really delicious and the jam is also delicious.\u201d Shao Yunan smiled and said, \u201cYour father has bought land for a new house. When our new house is built, little father will ask your father to get us a baking oven. Little father will then teach you how to make many delicious snacks. When Nizi grows up and meets someone she likes, she will make snacks for him to eat.\u201d Nizi blushed and threw herself into her father\u2019s arms. Wang Qing also smiled and said, \u201cLittle Father\u2019s cooking is the best I\u2019ve ever eaten.\u201d\u201cLittle father will cook for you every day, as long as he is not busy. Tomorrow, little father and your father will go to the county town and I don\u2019t know when we will return, so you will go to Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d After holding Nizi and rocking her for a while, Shao Yunan let her go. Wang Shijing silently cleaned up the dishes with Wang Qing\u2019s help. Shao Yunan watched Wang Shijing enter the kitchen and exhaled a sigh of relief. The Wang family was insulting them like they were beasts. When they finished cleaning up, Shao Yunan started teaching Wang Qing and Nizi how to read and write. He then read them a short, easy-to-understand story, and left them to study on their own. The two children would wash up and go to bed by themselves at the end of the day.In the courtyard, Wang Shijing was washing his family of four\u2019s clothes, his expression tense. Shao Yunan didn\u2019t wash the clothes, since Wang Shijing would not let him touch cold water. Shao Yunan moved a stool to sit next to Wang Shijing, while he dealt with the rest of the chestnuts and said, \u201cWell, if your heart is still not comfortable, tomorrow when I see Lord Jiang I will let him sentence Wang Tianyan and Wang Guo for a few more months. Wasn\u2019t Wang Zhisong going to take an exam next year? I can find a few people to kidnap him. Let\u2019s see how he would take the exam then. We have plenty of ways to let them not be able to live in peace. There\u2019s no need to sulk by yourself.\u201dWang Shijing opened his mouth, his voice muted\u2026 \u201cI blame myself. If I had separated earlier, Qing and Nizi would have suffered less.\u201d Shao Yunan said, \u201cIf you separated earlier, how could you separate? Wang Wenhe is biased. Would he support you? If the old woman puts down a card of filial piety, you wouldn\u2019t have had a chance to say anything. It\u2019s not too late, Qing and Nizi suffered and it hurt me to hear it, but because they have suffered, they will be more promising than other children in the future.\u201d\u201cWhen Heaven is about to place great responsibility on a great man, it always first frustrates his spirit and will, exhausts his muscles and bones, exposes him to starvation and poverty, and harasses him with troubles and setbacks to stimulate his spirit, toughen his nature, and enhance his abilities.\u201d Wang Shijing bowed his head and rubbed Shao Yunan\u2019s hair. \u201cYunan\u2026 Yunan\u2026\u201d Shao Yunan raised his head, letting Wang Shijing take possession of it, licking him gently as he kissed him. Wang Qing covered his sister\u2019s eyes and closed the door quietly. He heard what his little father said, although he didn\u2019t quite understand what it meant, he still seemed to understand a little.At night, the passion continued. The naked bodies entangled to their fullest. Wang Shijing still did not do it till the end, but used his hands, lips, and tongue to completely and utterly imprint his presence on Shao Yunan\u2019s body. He cried \u2018wife\u2019 over and over again, crying out for the wife he reluctantly, but happily married. \u201cIt\u2019s much better indeed. The corner of your eyes look much cleaner than the first day I saw them. The blindfold should also be changed every day to keep the eye clean.\u201d\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d Wang Shijing sat on the bed and let Shao Yunan wipe his eyes. The resentment of the previous night dissipated after a passionate night. Wang Shijing buried his hatred in the depths of his heart, not letting it go, but allowing it to reawaken every time he remembered it. When Shao Yunan put down the cloth towel, Wang Shijing got up and hugged him. He then picked up the basin with one hand and led Shao Yunan out of the room with the other.Wang Qing had already cooked the porridge. After the separation of the family, Wang Qing and Nizi ate the fragrant white rice porridge almost every day,which was almost impossible to eat before. Both children liked to eat it and Shao Yunan was also used to drinking congee in the morning. Now that the family didn\u2019t have a problem with money, together with this white rice congee there were also many other dishes. One by one, fried eggs and jam with fried steamed buns were eaten. Wang Qing said hesitantly, \u201cLittle father, can you write down the words you said to father last night?\u201d\u201cWhat words?\u201d Shao Yunan didn\u2019t respond for a moment. Wang Qing said, \u201cAbout responsibility placed by heaven or something.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Shao Yunan smiled. \u201cOf course, these words were\u00a0 incomplete. Little father will write them down for you and explain them to you. This is a very sensible passage for you to write down.\u201d\u201cWell! I just thought it was awesome!\u201d\u201cDaddy, I\u2019ll write it down, too.\u201d\u201cNizi is such a good child, little daddy will buy Nizi a snack when he comes back.\u201d Nizi shook her head. \u201cLittle daddy makes delicious jam and sweet-scented osmanthus which are much better than dim sum.\u201d Shao Yunan was very proud. Wang Shijing\u2019s one eye was also warm and happy. Instead of letting Shao Yunan clean up, Wang Shijing went to wash the plates, while Shao Yunan went to write the paragraph for Wang Qing. This passage comes from \u2018Mencius\u2019, one of the four great books. But because history was different here, they didn\u2019t have \u2018Mencius\u2019 here either.Yao Shun Yu and other ancient figures still existed in the history of the Great Yan and the opening paragraph of this passage mentions several famous figures in history. So Shao Yunan did not change these characters, but described the characters who did not appear in the history of the Great Yan as capable scholars in ancient mythology. When Shao Yunan wrote down the passage and carefully explained the full meaning of the passage to Wang Qing and Wang Nizi, the two children looked at their little daddy with starry eyes, their little father was really good!Wang Shijing was also listening from the kitchen. He quickly washed the dishes as he listened attentively. After the explanation, Shao Yunan silently touched Wang Qing\u2019s head and said, \u201cQing you have to remember. Studying is not to gain fame, but to make us learn and analyze. Only when people can think, can our country progress, which makes the history of mankind progress. You have to learn to observe the people and things around you, then think about them. It\u2019s also okay to ask yourself why and ask others why.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To paraphrase it in modern words, \u2018I don\u2019t understand, but I think it\u2019s awesome!\u2019\u201cWhen you can write more words, you have to write a paragraph of your own feelings about this passage. You can combine what you have seen and heard. Can you do it?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you can do it.\u201d Giving Wang Qing a look of encouragement, Shao Yunan looked at the adorable Wang Nizi. \u201cNizi has to practice her writing and learn her reasoning well first. It doesn\u2019t matter if she can memorize it.\u201d\u201cI will memorize it!\u201d\u201cOur Nizi is really ambitious. She will definitely be a Female Scholar in the future.\u201d Wang Nizi shyly hugged her little father again. When it was time to go out, Shao Yunan helped pack up the things the two children wanted to take to Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house, while Wang Shijing whispered, \u201cCan these be seen by outsiders?\u201d He was referring to the passage written by Shao Yunan. Shao Yunan said indifferently. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll push it on you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Wang Shijing didn\u2019t say anything. Shao Yunan sent the two children to Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house, while Wang Shijing went to Wang Xing\u2019s house to borrow an ox cart. Wang Xing was not at home. He had gone up the mountain to pick red sour fruits and peaches. Zhao He told him that he wanted to collect red sour fruits and peaches, and would pay 10 copper coins per kilo of the red fruit, while peaches were 30 copper coins per kilo. The amount of money was not low. When villagers picked the red sour fruits before, they could sell them at most for one or two copper coins per kilo and since the wild peaches were so sour, no one bought them at all. As long as the young people in the village had nothing else to do, they would all go up the mountain to look for red red sour fruit and peaches.Shao Yunan\u2019s only response was a smile. When he arrived at Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house, Zhao Lizheng\u2019s and Zhao Yuande\u2019s enthusiasm almost drowned him in goose bumps, making him almost flee in distress. Some of the wives, sisters-in-law, and idle men in the village, who did not go up the mountain saw Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan going to the county town again and started another discussion. But Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing were both indifferent to gossip.Soon it would be farming season and their family had bought ten acres of land. Shao Yunan also intended to buy a cow. Wang Shijing\u2019s body looked very strong, but he must have some deficiencies inside. Although he had the spiritual spring water, Shao Yunan still did not want him to become overtired. Since he himself was not farmer material, buying a cow would make it easier for Wang Shijing and also more convenient to go out in the future, because Shao Yunan did not want to always have to borrow a cart from Aunt Wang. When his first bucket of money was earned, he would buy a carriage.When they arrived at the county town, Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing went straight to theYamen. When he arrived at the gate of the Yamen, Shao Yunan took out the jade plate and said, \u201cA county magistrate.\u201d As soon as the guards saw the jade plate, he immediately opened the side door of the Yamen, letting the two men accompany him into the Yamen. The first half of the Yamen was a place where Yamen officers worked and cases were heard, while the second half was the place where the county magistrate and his followers lived. Entering through the side door was equivalent to entering the residential area. They were welcomed and led inside by a servant boy who heard that they had come to visit the county magistrate and had the magistrate\u2019s jade plate with them.Through a small garden, the boy led them to the side hall and then went to inform the county magistrate. Shao Yunan was carrying a gift for Magistrate Jiang in his hand, while Wang Shijing carried the gifts for everyone else in his basket. They didn\u2019t wait long before they heard footsteps and then stood up at once. The door opened and Jiang Kangning, gently walked in dressed in civilian clothes. Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing immediately bowed and saluted. Jiang Kangning let them sit down, as he walked to the upper seat and sat down. Soon the servant boy brought tea. The county magistrate asked the servant boy to leave, so they could talk. As soon as he opened his mouth, Jiang Kangning asked, \u201cHave you two been given a hard time after you returned?\u201dShao Yunan was still full of doubts about how much the county magistrate cared, so he just replied, \u201cThere are people who don\u2019t understand, but most of them do. We have a clear conscience. \u201d Jiang Kangning nodded approvingly, while Shao Yunan put the bamboo basket on the table and took out the two jars, chestnuts, fresh mushrooms, and fresh artemisia annua. He didn\u2019t bring the peach paste and crab legs since they had not yet dried. The mushrooms and artemisia annua were preserved by Shao Yunan in the space and Wang Shijing strictly adhered to the no-questions-asked principle.Shao Yunan said: \u201cYour Excellency, this is the jam I made myself and some mountain goods picked up on the mountain. It\u2019s not anything valuable, but please have a taste.\u201d Jiang Kangning was not unfamiliar with these mountain goods, but he was very curious about the jam Shao Yunan mentioned so he asked, \u201cJam, what is it?\u201d Shao Yunan got up and brought the two jars to Jiang Kangning\u2019s side of the square table and said, \u201cI made it with goat milk fruit, also known as red sour fruit and wild peaches. Your excellency, it can be smeared on steamed buns, cakes, and snacks to eat or just mixed with water to drink. The taste is pretty uncommon.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Jiang Kangning became very interested and immediately opened the seal. When two different sweet aromas emerged, Jiang Kangning\u2019s eyes opened wider in surprise. Shao Yunan said, \u201cIf your Excellency likes it, I will make it again and send it to you later when the wild fruits on the mountain are ripe.\u201d Jiang Kangning picked up the jar and looked at it, then smelling it he said, \u201cThis is really something rare. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen it. You can sell it for a good price.\u201dWas the county magistrate really interested or did he have motives? Shao Yun\u2019an was a bit puzzled by the county magistrate\u2019s kindness, but he still smiled and said, \u201cI know it can sell for money, but there are only two people who can work in my family, Shijing and I. The children are still young, so I can only sell a few jars at most. I taught a big brother in the village how to make this jam. Their family has many adults, so if someone really buys it, it would be a good income. If they earn money, they will also share some with me.\u201d\u201cYou taught it to others?\u201d Jiang Kangning was very surprised. This was an obvious opportunity to make money but he gave it away so easily. Shao Yunan said, \u201cMy family size is small, so If I want to make money I have to find something that is not so hard. Both of our children are still small and I plan to send my son to a private school next year. I need to take care of my family and there are many ways to earn money. It only depends on whether you can think of them.\u201d Jiang Kangning put down the jar and said, \u201cSince you\u2019ve made up your mind, just do it. This jam is good. You should also send some to Dean Cen.\u201d\u201cNaturally, I already prepared jam for both Dean Cen and the two teachers.\u201d Jiang Kangning nodded approvingly and said, \u201cTo sell this jam, you need to find the right buyer. The owner behind the Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion and Yizhang Xuan is the same person. That person\u2019s background is also not bad. As a person, he could also be considered honest, so If you take this jam to Yizhang Xuan restaurant, the boss will definitely accept it. If you sell it by yourself, I am afraid it would be coveted. Things that make money tend to attract greed.\u201dShao Yunan stood up and saluted. \u201cThank you for your advice.\u201d Jiang Kangning pressed his hand, asking Shao Yunan to sit down as spoke casually. \u201cThat day in the county school, I noticed that you must have studied somewhere. Who did you study under?\u201d That day, Jiang Kangning sent someone to check Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing. But as a result of the investigation, Shao Yunan\u2019s words turned out to be completely true. The Wang family was truly unkind and this Shao Yunan used to be a villager of Shaojia Village. The Shao family was also an ordinary farming family. Neither of the two sons of the Shao family has studied, so where did Shao Yunan get his knowledge? In addition, the most important point was that Shao Yunan\u2019s temper has changed a lot, almost like he became a different person.Before marriage, Shao Yunan was silent and introverted. A person of few words and just like Wang Shijing, was bullied at home. But after marriage, Shao Yunan became extraordinarily strong, so one had to wonder. Shao Yunan knew that people would be suspicious of his character change, so he just calmly replied. \u201cI don\u2019t remember where my teacher came from. I was adopted by the Shao family, but before I was adopted I should have learned how to read and write. I just don\u2019t remember a lot of things. Although my adoptive parents adopted me, they never treated me as their own son. Every time I showed that I could read when I was a child, I couldn\u2019t avoid being reprimanded, so over time I stopped showing my skills in front of others.\u201d\u201cThe Shao clan is strict. Before I got married, if I rebelled my adoptive parents would use filial piety to punish me according to the rules of the clan. In such a family, all I could do was to be patient. When I got married, I became free, so I didn\u2019t have to endure anymore. Having died once, I also had some epiphany and no longer felt confused. In fact, thanks to Shijing\u2019s love and care, I can be as carefree as I am now. If I had married someone like Wang Zhisong, I would have continued to endure until he divorced me or I died.\u201dIf there was no county magistrate in front of him, Wang Shijing would have hugged Shao Yunan. The Shao family and the Wang family were essentially the same and it was easy to imagine what Shao Yunan\u2019s time in the Shao family was like. There must have been a lot of suffering and aggravation. But the thought that Shao Yunan almost married Wang Zhisong, made Wang Shijing momentarily scared.Jiang Kangning nodded soberly, it did make sense. He then asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t remember anything about your biological parents?\u201d Shao Yunan shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t remember. I had a few fevers when I was young so I don\u2019t remember anything before I was seven or eight years old. It was only when I grew up and overheard my adoptive parents mention it that I learned I was adopted. That was also when I understood why my parents treated me differently from my big brother and little sister.\u201dJiang Kangning asked, \u201cThe people in Shao\u2019s village don\u2019t seem to know you\u2019re adopted.\u201d Not surprised that Jiang Kangning had investigated him, Shao Yunan just smiled bitterly and said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that only my adoptive parents know where I came from. But since I don\u2019t remember, there is no point in pursuing it. I am now living a peaceful life and don\u2019t want to cause any more trouble. I have also severed ties with them, so it\u2019s already good that they don\u2019t bother me.\u201dJiang Kangning nodded and said, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then this official will not get involved and investigate.\u201d Speaking of this, he took out the stone that Shao Yunan asked him to keep from his pocket, put it on the square table and said, \u201cThere are no outsiders here, take this stone back.\u201d Jiang Kangning\u2019s behavior once again refreshed Shao Yunan\u2019s understanding of the ancient county magistrate, so he immediately said, \u201cYour excellency, when I said it\u2019s in your custody, it\u2019s in your custody. You gave me your jade plate and I took it as your consent. If you want to give me back the stone, don\u2019t I have to give you back the jade plate? Your jade plate is my lifeline, so I can\u2019t do that.\u201dJiang Kangning raised his eyebrows, but smiled. \u201cThe jade plate that this official gave you, will not be taken back, unless you commit treason and do bad things.\u201d Shao Yunan still shook his head. \u201cNo. I will only feel uneasy if the stone is not with you, Your Excellency. In my heart, this jade plate of yours is much more valuable than that stone. If this stone is not with me I will not miss it, but if this jade plate is not with me, others will dare to mess with me. Your Excellency, you are Shijing\u2019s and my guardian.\u201d\u201cHahahaha,\u201d Jiang Kangning was amused by Shao Yunan\u2019s \u2018outspokenness\u2019. If anyone else had said that, he would have felt that he was flattering him, but when the words came out of Shao Yunan\u2019s mouth, he couldn\u2019t help but feel that this man\u2019s words were true to his nature. \u201cSince you insist so much, I\u2019d better keep it for you.\u201d Jiang Kangning took back the stone and Shao Yunan smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t scare me like this in the future, your excellency. I am very timid.\u201d\u201cHa ha ha.\u201d Jiang Kangning nudged Shao Yunan. \u201cIf you are timid, then there\u2019s no one who\u2019s bold.\u201d\u201cHa ha ha.\u201d Shao Yunan just pretended to be stupid.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When they come out of the Yamen, Wang Shijing said to Shao Yunan, \u201cYesterday, Shaojia\u2019s Village head come to see you. I went there for you.\u201d Shao Yunan raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhat did he want to see me for?\u201d Wang Shijing said, \u201cHe said that your adoptive parents saved your life by adopting you and asked you not to pursue your origins. He did not go into details, but I think he knows something. I told him that as long as he can control your adoptive parents, you would stop talking about your life experience. Uncle Zhao reminded me that Shaojia Village should have already heard about your relationship with Jiang Kangning, so he came here in fear that you might mention something to him.\u201d Shao Yunan said coldly, \u201cAs long as they are smart, I am not picky either.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I said to him. He said that since you signed a letter of separation with your family, from now on, both sides will not deal with each other since you are no longer a member of the Shao clan.\u201d\u201cThen I Should really thank them for their great kindness.\u201d A blank stare from Shao Yunan sealed the matter. Therefore, they should hold tight the thigh of the county magistrate, Jiang Kangning. The two then went to the county school. Coincidentally, the county school was closed, but the guard at the door was Uncle Zhuang, so Shao Yunan took out a jar of goat milk jam and gave it to him. When he received the gift, Uncle Zhuang smiled happily and told Shao Yunan in great detail where Dean Cen and the two teachers lived. The two teachers lived in the county school with their families, while dean Cen\u2019s residence was not far away from the county school.After Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing discussed it for a bit, the two of them first went to visit the two teachers, before going to Dean Cen\u2019s house. The two teachers were quite surprised at Shao Yunan\u2019s visit, but Shao Yunan just gave them the jam and mountain products, and apologized once again. They received a novel gift called \u2018jam\u2019, while Shao Yunan showed great courtesy and \u2018cleverness\u2019, making the two teachers who were already impressed with Shao Yunan, like him even more. Knowing that Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing\u2019s son wanted to go to private school the next year, the two teachers gave Shao Yunan some educational books and reminded him that ordinary private schools could be attended in advance, with some extra money.The books given by the two teachers could be bought in the county bookstore. Although Shao Yunan had already bought the books, the books given by the two teachers were full of commentaries and their own insights, which completely provided free pre-school education! Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing say thank you again and again, this was really a treasure which could not be bought with money alone!For Shao Yunan, the ancient people\u2019s courtesy was really an eye opener and also showed the ancients\u2019 interpretation of the word \u2018gift\u2019. After all, there are only a few scholars as immoral as Wang Zhisong. Most of the scholars in this era were orthodox, educated, cultured, sophisticated, quality people.When they arrived at Dean Cen\u2019s house, luckily he was at home. After being informed by the servant boy, Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing were brought to the main hall. Seeing the two, Dean Cen showed a kind smiling expression as the couple respectfully greeted him. Shao Yunan then directly explained the purpose of his visit. \u201cDean Cen, this junior made some jam, so please have a taste while it\u2019s still fresh.\u201d Wang Shijing put the jar in his hand and a bag filled with mountain goods into Dean Cen\u2019s hand. Dean Cen was equally curious. \u201cJam? What is it?\u201d Shao Yunan told the story. \u201cOne jar is made from goat milk fruit, or red sour fruit, while the other is made from wild peaches. What it is, Dean Cen will know after giving it a taste.\u201d\u201cHuh.\u201d Dean Cen stopped asking and just said, \u201cHow are you today? Did the clan patriarch make it difficult for you when he got back?\u201d Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan were very grateful. They had only met each other once, but the other side was mindful of them. Wang Shijing replied, \u201cThank you for your concern. Most of the clan members understand. As for the rest, Shao Yunan and I won\u2019t care about them.\u201d When Wang Shijing didn\u2019t mention the clan patriarch. It became clear in Dean Cen\u2019s mind, so he turned to say, \u201cYou two have two children, a boy and a girl, right?\u201dShao Yunan\u2026 \u201cYes. The eldest son is six years old and the daughter is four. Shijinga and I want to see if we can send our eldest son to study in the county town next spring.\u201d Dean Cen nodded. \u201cAt the age of seven next year, it\u2019s not too early to start attending private school. Whether or not he can get a place in the examination is secondary. The important thing is to let him know the principles from a young age and not be an uneducated person.\u201dDean Cen did not mention his own \u201cWhite Moon Academy\u201d, so Shao Yunan did not mention it either. The two sides talked for a while, then Dean Cen gave Shao Yunan some educational books for Wang Qing. The books given by Dean Cen were naturally better than the ones given by the two teachers. They could not be bought at the county bookstore, but were full of comments and insights. The couple sincerely thanked dean Cen and then offered to leave. Dean Cen did not stop them.After leaving Dean Cen\u2019s home, the two found a teahouse to drink some tea and casually bought two fruit cakes. Since Shao Yunan didn\u2019t plan to save money, they acted very prosperous. At this time, the food and beverages were still very underdeveloped, like Yizhang Xuan food. If it was served in modern times, it would taste worse than some stalls. Shao Yunan, who was not too hungry, did not have much of an appetite, while Wang Shijing would rather eat Shao Yunan\u2019s cooking.There was still a jar of goat milk jam and peach jam in the basket. After the two people who had a good rest left the teahouse, Shao Yunan said, \u201cShijing lets go to the Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion. Let\u2019s be good and see if we can find a buyer for Uncle Lizheng\u2019s family first.\u201d Wang Shijing wondered, \u201cIsn\u2019t the Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion selling jewelry?\u201d Shao Yunan said, \u201cThe value of something delivered to your door is definitely different from something that someone begs for. We should give jam to the owner of the Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion to thank him for his kindness in buying the stone and solving our urgent needs. But if we go directly to Yizhang Xuan restaurant that can use jam, then what we send is the goods. The shopkeeper of Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion is not stupid, if he see the value of the jam he will immediately tell the shopkeeper of Yizhang Xuan restaurant. If they are really interested in the jam, they will certainly come to our door and then we will have the initiative in naming the price.\u201d Wang Shijing understood. \u201cI will listen to you.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In a short time, the voice of shopkeeper Zeng came from the staircase. \u201cBrother Shao.\u201d Shao Yunan looked up and greeted, \u201cBoss Zeng.\u201d Then introduced the person beside him. \u201cThis is my husband, Wang Shijing.\u201d\u201cBrother Wang, please come upstairs.\u201d Boss Zeng brought the two of them to the same room as before, while the clerk served the tea. The shopkeeper Zeng laughed and joked. \u201cEven old Zeng could hear about brother Shao\u2019s popularity in the county school. It\u2019s a pity that Zeng was not able to see the action with his own eyes.\u201d Shao Yunan was not embarrassed in the slightest as he said with a smile, \u201cI was forced to do so. I didn\u2019t expect you to hear about it. I\u2019m not going to be famous now, right?\u201d Shopkeeper Zeng followed his lead by saying, \u201cFame or not, Zeng does not know, but these days there are many people in the teahouse and pub talking about this. Most of them sympathize with Brother Shao and Brother Wang, and some people even praise Brother Shao for his decisiveness. \u201cShao Yunan was embarrassed and just smiled awkwardly. Shopkeeper Zeng also changed the topic. \u201cSince brother Shao came here today, do you have another rare thing to sell?\u201d The flesh like stone, shopkeeper Zeng as a merchant naturally must have learned about it and was now excited to see it. However, this meat like stone was now in the hands of the county magistrate, so shopkeeper Zeng asked about it as a side attack.Shao Yunan just played dumb as he spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I have something rare to sell. Shopkeeper Zeng helped to solve our urgent problem and since the county magistrate asked me to come to the Yamen today, I made some jam as a gift for the county magistrate. I also want to give some to shopkeeper Zeng as a token of our gratitude. I also have some mountain products produced in the village, so I\u2019ll give them to shopkeeper Zeng as well.\u201d Wang Shijing acted perfectly as an \u2018assistant\u2019 and took out the last two small jars of jam and a bag of mountain products from his back basket. After all, shopkeeper Zeng was a businessman, so when he heard the word jam, he immediately got excited and asked, \u201cWhat is jam?\u201dShao Yunan shamelessly replied, \u201cIt\u2019s a paste made from the wild fruits on the mountain. My family picked a lot of them to eat and since letting them rot would be a pity, Shijing and I thought that making a paste that could last longer would be better. I ate it and it tasted quite good. It can also be eaten directly or accompanied by steamed buns, cakes, or snacks. Adding it into water to drink is also okay. If shopkeeper Zeng likes it, I will make some more for you when the wild fruits on the mountain are ripe. \u201cThese words have several meanings in shopkeeper Zeng\u2019s ears. First, the raw materials were wild fruits. Second, it could be made from a variety of fruits. Third, this thing could last a long time, fourth it was rare and fifth, there were many ways to eat this thing! Shopkeeper Zeng did not care much about etiquette and in front of the two people, opened both jars. At once, two different sweet scents of fruit came out. One of them had a strong peach fragrance.Shopkeeper Zeng couldn\u2019t hide his surprise. It smelled so appetizing! Shopkeeper Zeng raised his eyes. \u201cThis is made from peaches?\u201d Shao Yunan nodded. \u201cOne jar is made from peaches and the other is made from red sour fruits.\u201d Shopkeeper Zeng looked at the \u2018paste\u2019 in the jar and immediately called out to the younger clerk to bring two bamboo spoons. The boy quickly brought two bamboo spoons and Shopkeeper Zeng scooped a spoonful of peach jam to taste it. Shao Yunan, who looked at the experienced expression, tried to bite his tongue. Once the shopkeeper tasted it carefully and took a sip of tea, he changed the spoon before scooping up some red sour fruit jam.After tasting the two tablespoons of jam, the shopkeeper looked at Shao Yunan with so much intensity that even Shao Yunan could not bear to look straight into his eyes, which also made Wang Shijing\u2019s one eye a little gloomy. \u201cBrother Shao, please sit down for a while. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\u201cI will wait, Shopkeeper Zeng.\u201d Shopkeeper Zeng got up and went out with hurried steps. Then Wang Shijing suddenly held Shao Yunan\u2019s hand forcefully, meeting Shao Yunan\u2019s puzzlement. Wang Shijing held his hand for a long time before asking, \u201cThis Shopkeeper Zeng, has a family, right?\u201d Shao Yunan froze for a moment, then he muffled a laugh, pulling out his hand from Wang Shijing\u2019s grip and then circling them around Wang Shijing\u2019s neck, dragging the person over and nibbling hard at the other person\u2019s mouth.\u201cHe is not attracted to me, but to the good things in my hands. Besides, he\u2019s old enough to be my father.\u201d After another nibble, Shao Yunan said very unashamedly. \u201cBut I like it when you are jealous of me.\u201d Wang Shijing felt quite ashamed, but his wife said he liked it so he had nothing to be ashamed of in the end. Turning passivity into initiative, Wang Shijing pressed the back of Shao Yunan\u2019s head and kissed him hard on the mouth. His wife was too attractive and only became more and more attractive, so much so he had to keep an eye on him. Shopkeeper Zeng brought another man with him when he came back. Not noticing Shao Yunan\u2019s reddish lips, Shopkeeper Zeng directly introduced them. \u201cBrother Shao, this is Mr. Xu of Yizhang Xuan restaurant. Old Xu, this is little brother Shao and his husband, Wang Shijing.\u201d\u201cLittle Brother Shao, Brother Wang.\u201d Both sides saluted each other and then Shopkeeper Zeng gave the spoon to Boss Xu. Boss Xu\u2019s expression while tasting was very similar to Shopkeeper Zeng\u2019s. Then boss Xu, who was very straightforward, opened his mouth and asked, \u201cLittle brother Shao, if you still have some extra jam left, I from Yizhang Xuan restaurant want all of them. The price is negotiable.\u201d Shao Yunan did not show the surprise that the two people thought there should be, he just frowned and then said with a bit of apology. \u201cI only have a few jars left at home. I have given the rest to my friends and relatives. I\u2019m not going to sell the rest since I left it for the children to eat.\u201dShopkeeper Xu and Zeng immediately looked disappointed, not knowing what to say next. Then Shao Yunan said, \u201cThis jam is not only very time-consuming to make, but also laborious. I planned to sell it, but my family is really short of manpower, so I told the production method to my family\u2019s good friends. They are also the family of the village chief of our Xiushui Village and is a way to return their protection of my family. They are very interested in doing this business, but I\u2019m not sure if they have found a buyer yet.\u201d Shopkeeper Xu looked anxious as he asked, \u201cI wonder if I can go to Xiushui Village with you? This jam is indeed a rare thing, so I would like to buy it all. I can also guarantee that the production method of the jam would not be coveted by others. I will pay two taels of silver for a jar of red sour fruit jam and three taels of silver for a jar of peach jam.\u201dWang Shijing was frightened, but Shao Yunan was very calm. Things that were rare were precious, so good things that appeared for the first time would also not be cheap. However, business can only last for a long time if there is a real sense of doing business, so Shao Yunan directly negotiated for Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family. \u201cI will not hide it from the two bosses. Red sour fruit is abundant on the mountain, but peaches are rare. However, there are many kinds of wild fruit on the mountain, so there can be many varieties of jam a year. Even if you don\u2019t get fruits from the mountain, it\u2019s easy to get a piece of land and plant some. The price given by the shopkeeper Xu is too high. Everyone is doing business with integrity, so I don\u2019t want to cut off the future of jam for some momentary money.\u201d\u201cShopkeeper Xu, although the method of this jam is more or less the same, everyone\u2019s craftsmanship will be different. Now there are few peaches, so even if we want to make more we can\u2019t do it. Why don\u2019t Shopkeeper Xu try to buy it for 800 copper coins per kilo and the red sour fruit jam for 400 copper coins per kilo. Now is the best time to harvest red sour fruit. Later when there will be no more red sour fruit, shopkeeper Xu should adjust the price. The jam made would also need time and a channel to be sold by shopkeeper Xu.\u00a0 If you can\u2019t sell it, you can\u2019t make money even when it\u2019s made. It\u2019s a mutual benefit. Shopkeeper Xu may also want to jar the jam according to your own needs. In the future, the price of each jar of jam might as well be set according to the quality, quantity, and cost of the fruit in the season, so that the price becomes flexible and neither side feels at a loss.\u201dHow much would Yizhang Xuan restaurant sell one kilo of jam for? It was their own business. But for Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family that would become the direct manufacturer, considering the long-term business, it was enough to sell for the wholesale price. Besides, if the price was too high, more people would become jealous, which would not be a good thing for Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family. The price proposed by Shao Yunan could still make Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family earn a lot of money even after deducting the costs and labor. Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family paid 10 copper coins per kilo of red sour fruits and 30 copper coins per kilo of peaches. Deducting the labor and cost price proposed by Shao Yuan could still let Zhao Lizheng earn a lot of money a year.Water was essential for jam making. Basically one kilo of fruit could produce one kilo of jam. If they really tried to sell it at the price proposed by shopkeeper Xu, it would really be cheating others, which was definitely not a good thing for doing business long term. It was not a good thing to wantonly raise prices just because something was rare. You can raise prices for some things at will, while others, such as jam, are not very difficult to make so it was better to be honest from the start. Also Zhao Lizheng\u2019s prices should be appropriate. After all, the method of jam production could not be kept a secret for long.Shopkeeper Xu and Zeng both doubted their own ears, especially shopkeeper Xu. He was prepared for Shao Yunan to raise the price. Shao Yunan who saw through the two shopkeepers\u2019 thoughts, just smiled and said, \u201cIt would be best if this jam business could be done for a long time. There are a lot of wild fruits in the mountains and there is land in the village where it could still be grown. If there are more rare jams, the price will definitely also be higher.\u201d\u201cThis jam is rare, but it also has a shelf life. Even if you use this method of preservation, it can be kept fresh for four or five months. Shopkeeper Xu, you would still need to transport the goods before selling them, which would also generate cost. If both buyers and sellers are sincere, we can happily cooperate for a long time with each other. It\u2019s true that the money can\u2019t be made all the time and it\u2019s true that water needs to flow, otherwise the businessmen will have a grudge against each other. Shopkeeper Xu treats me as a good seller for our Xiushui Village, so if there will be something rare in the village in the future Shopkeeper Xu will consider a long-term cooperation. The villagers have no right and no power, so if there are any difficulties in this business in the future, I also hope that the shopkeeper can help them.\u201dShopkeeper Xu bowed to Shao Yunan and said solemnly, \u201cLittle brother Shao is so honest, I Xu, accept little brother Shao\u2019s goodwill and promise to buy jam from Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family in the future. Whether it\u2019s little brother Shao or Xiushui Village, as long as the product is good I will accept it, the price would also be fair.\u201d\u201cThank you, Shopkeeper Xu, and thank you, Shopkeeper Zeng, for introducing such an opportunity to Xiushui Village. When I return, I will find Uncle Zhao Lizheng and tell him what shopkeeper Xu said. When the jam is ready, I will ask Uncle Zhao Lizheng\u2019s son to send it directly to Shopkeeper Xu to taste it. If the shopkeeper is satisfied, the two of you will sign the contract and start the official production.\u201d\u201cIf it isn\u2019t too much trouble for you brother Shao,\u201d Shopkeeper Xu said and clapped his hands, making a servant boy immediately come in from outside, holding a box in his hand. Shopkeeper Xu asked the servant boy to present the box to Shao Yunan and said, \u201cLittle brother Shao is so kind, this is my and Yizhang Xuan restaurant\u2019s thank you gift I want to present to brother Shao on behalf of my employer.\u201d Without looking, Shao Yunan guessed it was probably money so he just waved his hand. \u201cNo, no. There is no need for a thank you gift.\u201dShopkeeper Xu insisted. \u201cAs little brother Shao just said, business is based on honesty. Brother Shao might think he didn\u2019t do business with me, but Xu thinks Brother Shao deserves this gift of thanks. This jam will not only earn me money, but also reputation. So please accept it.\u201d Not to mention the fact that he took the initiative to lower the price by so much, this sincerity alone was enough for them to maintain a long-lasting friendship with Shao Yunan. Shopkeeper Zeng also tried to persuade them from the side, so after a short time Shao Yunan \u2018embarrassedly\u2019 stood up and saluted. \u201cThen I\u2019m sorry. Thank you shopkeeper Xu, thank you shopkeeper Zeng.\u201dAfter the business was done, Shao Yunan gained an unexpected fortune and said a big goodbye to the two shopkeepers. The two shopkeepers even personally sent the two of them to the front door, while shopkeeper Zeng even gave Shao Yunan a small gift, a pair of silver earrings worn by girls. The earrings were ordinary teardrop-shaped white jade, so he might have known that Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing had a daughter.The couple thanked them again and again before finally leaving together. After crossing the street and turning into the alley, Shao Yuan shook the box, the sound of silver ingots sounded so moving that he could no longer hold back his laughter. \u201cShijing, why do you think this money was so easily earned?\u00a0 No wonder the owner behind Yizhang Xuan restaurant and Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion could make his business so big. The shopkeeper was good at being a man and that owner was probably even better at being a man.\u201dWang Shijing was also very happy. The two didn\u2019t open the box to count how much money they had. They just put it into the basket on Wang Shijing\u2019s back, who then complimented: \u201cIt\u2019s because Yunan is so great. If it was someone else, they would find it difficult to earn money.\u201d Shao Yunan raised his chin proudly. \u201cYou don\u2019t regret marrying me, do you?\u201dWang Shijing replied by squeezing Shao Yunan\u2019s hand tightly. \u201cYou are my wife.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 51": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fierce \u201cHusband\u201dCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 26After the couple made some money on this trip, Shao Yunan decisively asked Wang Shijing to buy cattle, so they went to a place where livestock was sold. Shao Yunan covered his nose with a handkerchief, while Wang Shijing told him to wait outside while he went inside. Shao Yunan thought about it and followed him to have a look.Cattle were very important tools of production, which were sold uniformly by the government, who sold mostly calves. Sometimes the court, in order to encourage farmers to reclaim more land and produce more food, would subsidize silver money for farmers to buy cattle. But that was only the case when the court had money and the treasury was full. In recent years, the treasury was empty, taxes had increased and prices had risen.\u00a0 In the past cattle which were worth up to ten silver a head, now soared to 25 silver. One calf cost 25 silver, while the average farmer earned less than twenty-five silver taels in two years, leaving them unable to buy cattle, cultivate more land, produce more food, or earn more money. Some of them were only able to afford to pay taxes, which was a vicious circle. On this street there were many people watching but very few buying.Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan picked a female calf. Shao Yunan thought it would be best to buy a male and a female, but since it would be too eye-catching, they decided to buy a female first. When they \u2018earned\u2019 more money, they would buy a male. He spent another five taels of silver to buy two sheep, a male and a female. Most families bought sheep mainly for the milk, but not many people were buying sheep now, so they were sold cheaply.The cow and the two sheep were a total of thirty taels. Their house was small now and without any manpower, so pigs, chickens, and ducks would not be considered for the time being. If they wanted to eat chicken and eggs, they could buy them directly from the villagers. Anyway, they were not short on money.Shao Yunan asked Wang Shijing to take him to the porcelain shop, so he could buy dozens of tea jars, both large and small. He also ordered six large wine barrels and ten small wine barrels. Shao Yunan wanted the wine barrel to have a switch faucet, so that it would be more convenient to drink from. All the wine barrel needed was a hold for a cork, so Shao Yunan talked with the shopkeeper and drew a sketch. A metal faucet was not realistic, so they would need to use wood. Shao Yunan thought of the water fountain type of up and down open faucet, and explained what the principle of the switch was to the shopkeeper, who looked at him with a strange expression. Drinking wine would indeed be more convenient with this novelty.Once, the shopkeeper reached a contractual agreement with Shao Yunan, Shao Yunan left the design of the wine barrel to him. Maybe others would also want to buy this type of barrel or they might want to study it. Shao Yunan also did not care about the money, since it was likely he would have to deal with this shopkeeper for a long time in the future. Shao Yunan behaved so generously that the shopkeeper exempted all the money for the porcelain and the wine barrels that Shao Yunan bought. From now on, Shao Yunan only needed to come to the store to buy things according to its cheapest prices.Shao Yunan was very happy. Today was full of surprises. The custom-made barrels would be available for delivery in about 15 days, so after Shao Yunan calculated the time, he ordered ten large wine barrels and bought five ready-made large wine barrels. The shopkeeper also did not want to accept Shao Yunan\u2019s money for the fifteen barrels, but Shao Yunan did not let the shopkeeper give them to him for free. After the shopkeeper gave him the most favorable price, Shao Yunan paid only nine taels of silver. The larger the wine barrel was, the higher the craftsmanship required. The shopkeeper also said that when the custom-made wine barrels were ready, he would deliver them to Xiushui Village. Therefore, Shao Yunan would not need to make a special trip. Shao Yunan only felt that the ancient people were really truthful, and that the most important thing was that the ancients had a particularly strong awareness of intellectual property rights.With five large wine barrels and dozens of tea jars, the borrowed cattle cart was full again. Wang Shijing bought a calf, but temporarily did not use it to pull the cart. The two of them also bought some meat, snacks, and other things before riding the cart home with the three livestock they just bought home.When they returned to the village, there were inevitably some spectators and discussion again. The news of Wang Shijing\u2019s land purchase had already spread. After all, there was no way to avoid others\u2019 eyes when Zhao Lizheng took people to measure the land. All the villagers were talking about it, with both envy and jealousy, and even some hate. Wang Shijing bought another cart full of things after the separation from his family. Not to mention that it wasn\u2019t that long since he bought the place he was staying at now and ten acres of mountain land. Now he even bought cattle and two sheep, all of which cost a lot of money.Some people speculated about how much money Wang Shijing\u2019s stones were sold for, while others speculate that Wang Shijing must have brought back a lot of money from his military service. Some people even said some sour words, that it was no wonder that old lady Wang tried to make trouble and that since Wang Shijing was so rich now, he should give his own mother some money. There were also people who sympathized with old lady Wang, that since her son married a powerful daughter-in-law, all his money was taken away from herShao Yunan automatically closed his ears to all these remarks. After all, he was a modern man and would not be affected by these rumors. In the great state of Yan, household registration management was strict, but even such a strict system had loopholes that could be exploited. As long as the family has land, they could move to the city or even the capital as long as they have money. If Wang Qing later took an examination and got a good spot, he could spend money to make Wang Qing an official. Then since they were Wang Qing\u2019s family, their household registration could also be moved.The couple went home first and arranged a place for the cattle and sheep in the open space behind the house, then they put away what they bought today. After that, they went to Wang Xing\u2019s house to return the cattle. Of course, a bag of thank-you snacks could not be missed. It could be said that since Wang Shijing got married, Aunt Wang\u2019s family has eaten more snacks than they have ever eaten in their lifetime. As a result, Aunt Wang and Uncle Wang were always happy to see Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing. Wang Xing was also on call, whenever he was around.After sitting at Aunt Wang\u2019s house for a while, Shao Yunan first said that the county magistrate called them over and reprimanded him. It was wrong to make \u2018trouble\u2019 in the county school after all, but since the county magistrate was generous, it was only a reprimand so Aunt Wang only felt that this county magistrate was really reasonable. To be honest, the Wang clan was dissatisfied with the Wang Dali family for a long time, as well as with the patriarch Wang Wenhe. In the years when Wang Shijing was away from home, the patriarch forced people to do farm work for Wang Dali\u2019s family every year, but they didn\u2019t receive even one copper coin or mouthful of water for it. Every time the farm was busy, Wang Tianyan would either twist or break his foot when he was just lazy and slippery, even Wang Guo would look for reasons to not work.Who did not have land? Who was not busy during the farming period and did not have enough hands? Wang Wenhe used Wang Zhisong\u2019s merit to persuade them every time. But even if the people of the clan wanted to see future glory, how could there be no complaints? Fourth Uncle Wang and Wang Xing were also asked by the patriarch to go to Wang Dali\u2019s house to help. But fourth Aunt Wang, who was also a difficult person to mess with, went to Wang Wenhe\u2019s house and scolded the stingy old lady Wang. Their family did not want to take part in Wang Zhisong\u2019s future fame so Wang Wenhe should not ask the men from their family to help them. But not every family had someone as good as fourth Aunt Wang. In other families, if someone married a male wife, Wang Wenhe said that since they were both men it shouldn\u2019t be a problem, making it difficult to refuse.Following fourth Aunt Wang\u2019s words, Shao Yunan pretended to say casually that he had sold a design for a wine barrel and that the owner of the store generously gave him a sum of money, otherwise he would not be able to buy the cattle and sheep today. Aunt Wang asked what kind of design was worth so much money, but Shao Yunan said that he had signed a contract, so he could not tell anyone. But when it was produced he would show it to everyone. Fourth Aunt Wang was amazed, saying that Shao Yunan was very skilled and that Wang Shijing married a really capable wife. Then Wang Shijing, who sat silently at the side, had a smile of satisfaction in his eye.With the help of Aunt Wang\u2019s mouth to spread the news, Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing went to Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house. As soon as they arrived, they were greeted by a kind smile and hospitality. Shao Yunan kept rubbing his arms and had to whine, \u201cUncle Zhao, Aunt Zhao, if you keep doing that, I won\u2019t be able to tell you the good news I brought back.\u201d\u201cWhat good news?\u201d Aunt Zhao Liu pulled Shao Yunan over and headed for the house.Shao Yunan hugged Nizi who came out of the house and said, \u201cNo need to be so polite, I\u2019ll say.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Wang Shijing and Zhao Lizheng then entered the house. Some goat milk fruit and wild peaches were collected today, mostly picked from the nearby mountains by people in the village. Zhao Yuande and Zhao He were washing the fruits in the backyard and drying them. Hearing that Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing had come, they hurriedly packed up the processed fruits and washed their hands.When everyone sat down, Aunt Zhao Liu asked eagerly, \u201cYunan, what\u2019s the good news?\u201d Zhao Yuande and Zhao He were a bit confused before Shao Yunan started retelling the story. \u201cShopkeeper Xu of Yizhang Xuan restaurant wants to buy the jam. The price has been temporarily set at a kilo of goat milk jam for 400 copper coins and 800 copper coins for peach jam.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d There was a moment of silence. Shao Yunan just smiled and drank water without saying anything. After a few seconds several shrieks rang out. \u201cWhat? Goat milk jam for 400 copper coins and 800 copper coins for peach jam?\u201d Aunt Zhao Liu\u2019s voice trembled, while Zhao Lizheng and Zhao Yuande were even more wide-eyed, wondering if their ears were out of order. Shao Yunan just chuckled and nodded. \u201cYes, 400 copper coins for goat milk jam and 800 copper coins for peach jam. You heard it right. It\u2019s good news, right?\u201dZhao He grabbed Shao Yunan. \u201cYunan, are you kidding me?\u201d So expensive? This\u2026 how could this be possible?!\u201d They thought they would be satisfied with a few dozen copper coins for a kilo. Zhao Yuande looked at Wang Shijing with anxiety. \u201cShijing, is this true?\u201d Wang Shijing nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s true. Yunan gave the jam to Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion shopkeeper Zeng. When shopkeeper Zeng saw that the jam was rare, he called out Shopkeeper Xu of Yizhang Xuan restaurant, who was also interested in buying the jam. So Yunan helped to set the price of the jam for you with shopkeeper Xu.\u201dThe four members of Zhoa Lizheng\u2019s family all felt faint. Aunt Zhao Liu also could not respond. Then Shao Yunan explained in detail what happened and said, \u201cUncle Zhao, Aunt Zhao, you don\u2019t blame me for the price. One kilo of jam basically makes one kilo of jam. Since it is rare now we can raise the price high, but if our price is high, then the price set by the Yizhang Xuan restaurant would be even higher. So how many people could afford to buy it then? If no one buys it, the jam will not be worth anything. What we want to do is to make this jam business long lasting.\u201d\u201cNow that the fruits are getting less and less, the jam will be old at this price. If the fruits are more abundant the price should also go down. Shopkeeper Xu also said that Yizhang Xuan restaurant will also help with fruit collection in the future. It is also a measure to prevent someone from figuring out how to make jam, then lowering prices and disrupting your business. But since we set the price to be flexible, people can also feel our sincerity.\u201dZhao Lizheng immediately nodded vigorously. \u201cYou are right. We do not know about these things, so we still need Yunan to help us with more ideas in the future.\u201d Aunt Zhao Liu was almost speechless. \u201cSo it\u2019s settled? So expensive!\u201d None of the four people blamed Shao Yunan for lowering the price so much. To be honest, if they really sold the jam at the price proposed by shopkeeper Xu, Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep in peace.Shao Yunan said with a smile, \u201cYes, the buyer and the price are set. Now you should make goat milk jam and peach jam, and take it to Yizhang Xuan restaurant to show it to shopkeeper Xu. I also told shopkeeper Xu that although the method of making jam is the same, but due to personal craftsmanship, the taste will definitely also be different. Jam taste also depends on water quality, so it\u2019s best not to use the well water at home, but mountain spring water. Uncle Zhao, Aunt Zhao, if you have the means, collect some dates and hawthorn. There is no fruit in winter, but dates and hawthorn are durable, so when winter comes, you can make red date jam and hawthorn jam. You can also use sun-dried dates to make date jam. Make sure you have jam all year long.\u201dThe four members of the Zhao family nodded their heads and Aunt Zhao Liu even cried in excitement. Finally, Zhao Lizheng spoke up. \u201cYunan, this 10% profit is too little. If you want to collect any fruit, just ask. I will not ask you for any money. The profit is much higher than we thought, so we should share 50-50, otherwise I would not feel at ease doing this business.\u201d Who would have thought that the price of this jam would be set so high that Zhao Lizheng\u2019s hand shook? Not to mention Zhao Lizheng, Zhao Yuande\u2019s hands were also shaking from extreme excitement and expectation for their future life. Aunt Zhao Liu and Zhao He both agreed on the side that more money should be paid. Then Zhao Yuande said, \u201cBefore my father and I also discussed that if this jam can really be sold and the villagers start to comment, we will have the strength to deal with it if we have money.\u201dThis thought also occurred to Shao Yunan. He thought for a while and then said, \u201cLet\u2019s do it this way. Uncle Zhao, we will both sign a contract. The 10% profit will remain unchanged, but I will only charge it for two years and not take any more money after two years. I will also sell you the method of making jam for 100 taels of silver, but you don\u2019t have to pay me now. When you start earning money from selling the jam, you can pay me in installments. I have money in my hand now, so I am not in a hurry. Forget about the fifty- fifty split. I also have something to trouble Uncle Zhao, Aunt Zhao, and Brother Zhao with. I also need to collect some goat milk fruit every year, not for jam, but for other things. But my family is just me and Shijing, and it\u2019s also not as good as Uncle Zhao\u2019s family that has connections\u2026 so if you could help me with gathering.\u201d\u201cIn addition, I also want to collect some tea, but there are few tea trees in our villages. If it\u2019s possible I want to collect more from outside the village, which I also need help with from Uncle Zhao, Aunt Zhao, and Brother Zhao. If you could say outside that you spent 300 taels of silver to buy my recipe and paid it off in a lump sum, because I found the buyer outside, while giving me 20% commission on every deal I would be thankful. It will also be written in contract with Yizhang Xuan restaurant that jam would only be bought from you. In this way, even if some people are dissatisfied you can block their mouths. Just say that you bought the production method from me for 300 taels of silver, not including sales commission. That way, no one will guess where I got the money from.\u201d\u201cThis is still a loss for you.\u201d Uncle Zhao Lizheng hesitated. Wang Shijing then spoke up. \u201cUncle Zhao, if my family starts doing business, it will only cause trouble and only if you do it first, can we follow with doing other businesses with confidence if my family doesn\u2019t want to suffer losses. In fact, Uncle Zhao, you have to bear a lot of trouble and deal with the villagers, so it is you who might have to bear losses. Just listen to Yunan.\u201d\u201cUncle Zhao, it\u2019s a deal. Big brother Yuande please write the contract.\u201d Zhao Yuande looked at his father, while Zhao Lizheng looked seriously at Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing before taking a deep breath. \u201cYunan, Shijing, I will accept this favor and listen to what you guys want to do!\u201d Shao Yunan smiled, Aunt Zhao Liu smiled, and Zhao He also smiled. Zhao Yuande got up and went to write the contract with great enthusiasm. Shao Yunan then said, \u201cBrother He, first make two jars of each and no more. Tomorrow I will go with you. The jam will go bad in a few days and even if you put it in an ice cellar it can last a month at most. If you want to do business, you have to use a special way of insurance and you should do this insurance as soon as the product is ready. If shopkeeper Xu thinks that what your family has prepared is all right, then you can start the official production while I guide from the side.\u201d\u201cYunan, thank you so much.\u201d Zhao He\u2019s smile was so big, you couldn\u2019t see his eyes. Zhao Yuande wrote the contract. Shao Yunan meant for him to just write a hundred taels to buy the method, but he wrote that he would give Shao Yunan 10% of the fruit collected every year, no matter what it was. Zhao Yuande was very insistent, so Shao Yunan finally signed the contract. Zhao Lizheng might not have 100 taels of silver at this time, so Shao Yunan let them sell the jam first and make some money. Anyway, this is a private transaction so how could others check his money bags?The jam was not yet made, but the buyer has already been found and the price was negotiated. The last trace of anxiety in Zhao Lizheng\u2019s heart was completely eliminated. That night, the Lizheng\u2019s family directly invited Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing to stay for dinner. Anyway, Wang Qing and Nizi were already here. After dinner, Shao Yunan instructed Zhao He on how to make the jam from beginning to end. Then Zhao Yuande personally went to get the mountain spring water.The taste of their jam was worse than that of Shao Yunan. After all, Shao Yunan made his with water mixed with spiritual spring water. However, if you hadn\u2019t eaten Shao Yunan\u2019s jam, the taste of Zhao He\u2019s jam was also very good. Shao Yunan also came up with the idea of adding sweet-scented osmanthus to the goat milk and peach jam respectively. The jam with sweet-scented osmanthus tasted even more unique. Together with four jars of jam, Shao Yunan and Zhao He would go early in the morning to Yizhang Xuan restaurant.Shao Yunan also said that it was up to the Lizheng\u2019s family to decide whether or not to teach the jam production method to other people from their clan. Anyway, he had already sold the jam recipe for 100 taels, so he didn\u2019t care how Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family handled the recipe. Zhao Lizheng also said that Shao Yunan could sell the jam production method to others, as long as it would not affect their family business. The great state of Yan was very big so it was impossible for them to sell jam all over the country.The next day, Wang Shijing first took the villagers from the village up the mountain to pick tea, mainly teaching them the method of picking tea, and then went to the other village that Zhao Lizheng had friendly relationships with to collect more tea. He didn\u2019t specify how much money he would pay for collecting a kilo of tea, since Shao Yunan only gave Wang Shijing a range with the highest at three hundred copper coins per kilo and the lowest at 30 copper coins per kilo, depending on the grade of the tea. If he was not sure he should offer 50 copper coins per kilo, this way they would definitely not lose money.Since there wasn\u2019t much room at home, Shao Yunan did not accept wild chrysanthemum since whether he would make chrysanthemum tea to sell has not yet been decided. The shortage of manpower was one aspect, but Shao Yunan also did not want to cast a net all over the sky from the very beginning, so he only concentrated on his main priorities. Whether it was the status of the Zhao clan in the village, Aunt Zhao Liu, or Zhao He, they were all local bigwigs so it was absolutely appropriate and easy for Wang Shijing to collect tea from them.Early the next morning, Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing sent their two children to Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house and then Shao Yunan left two hundred taels of silver to Zhao Lizheng. Today, the people of the land department of the Yamen would come to measure the land. If they were quick they might even be able to pay for the deed today. Neither he nor Wang Shijing would be at home today, so he asked Zhao Lizheng for help with it. Zhao Yuande, Zhao He, and Shao Yunan went to the county town together. While Wang Shijing asked several boys he knew from the village to go up the mountain to find tea.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 52": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fierce \u201cHusband\u201dCH 27.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 27.1As soon as Zhao Yuande, Zhao He, and Shao Yunan arrived at the door of Yizhang Xuan restaurant, shopkeeper Xu came out. None of them knew if he specially waited for them, but after Shao Yunan introduced both sides they went to the office behind the Yizhang Xuan restaurant with shopkeeper Xu. Zhao Yuande and Zhao He took out four bottles of jam from their back basket while Shao Yunan explained that these four jars of jam were all made by Zhao He and two of them contained sweet-scented osmanthus. Shopkeeper Xu immediately brought a spoon to taste.The taste of two jars of jam without sweet-scented osmanthus was naturally not as good as that given by Shao Yunan to shopkeeper Zeng, but it was still very good so shopkeeper Xu still charged according to the price agreed yesterday. The jams with the sweet-scented osmanthus had a different taste. But shopkeeper Xu also accepted it, adding an extra 50 copper coins on the basis of the original one. After all, sweet-scented osmanthus could also be regarded as a cost. Zhao Yuande and Zhao He had no problem with it, so shopkeeper Xu immediately ordered someone to write the contract.Shao Yunan also mentioned the matter of preserving freshness again. If Zhao Yuande completed the preservation treatment first, it would be difficult for shopkeeper Xu to inspect the goods after he got them. If shopkeeper Xu could complete the preservation treatment themselves, they could avoid issues where some jars of jam did not meet their requirements and affected the other person\u2019s integrity. After Shao Yunan said that he would provide the preservation method for free, shopkeeper Xu said that it was still up to the Zhao\u2019s to do the preservation.The restaurant would still check the quality of each batch, but in a way that would allow them to keep it fresh as long as possible. In addition, they would provide the jam jars so there would be no need for Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family to pay for them. Zhao Yuande and Zhao He really didn\u2019t know how to thank Shao Yunan. In this way another freshness contract was signed and Shao Yunan explained the method of preserving freshness. Since he could not write many words, he let shopkeeper Xu write it down.The best way to preserve the jam\u2019s freshness was definitely canning. The method provided by Shao Yunan was to cook the jam jars in hot water, covered with a layer of cloth or paper for about ten minutes before sealing it quickly with paraffin or mud, similar to the preservation of wine. The other was to pour paraffin wax at the top of the jar, then slowly seal the jar to expel the air and then finally seal it. You just needed to scoop out the paraffin wax first before eating it. Of course, the paraffin wax used must be edible paraffin wax, but in ancient times there were no oils, so basically all refined paraffin wax was non-toxic and harmless.The two contracts were written and the shopkeeper expressed his hope that the first batch of jam would be delivered as soon as possible. As long as the quality of the jam could meet the standard of the one he ate today, they would buy as much as was delivered. It was also stated in the contract that Yizhang Xuan restaurant would only buy jam from Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family. If the jam with the sweet-scented osmanthus became more popular, then the order would also be increased. Shopkeeper Xu also immediately paid a deposit of 50 taels of silver.Just handing over the four jars of jam got them fifty taels of silver, Zhao Yuande who went out of the office and into the ox cart still felt his hands trembling. Zhao He was also not much better. This time Shao Yunan taught him the method of making jam directly, making Zhao He very grateful. He was a male wife and only had one child. Although Zhao Yuande loved and cared about him, he could not help being a little sad in his heart. But now that the jam would be mainly made by him, Zhao He became much more confident than before.When they returned to the village, Shao Yunan first told Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family members about the matter. He then went to instruct Zhao He on how to make the jam in large quantities, while Aunt Zhao Liu, Zhao Yuande, and Zhao Lizheng handled the fruit. So much fruit was collected that they needed to be processed urgently. This batch of fruit was not prepared with other people except Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family members, so they became very tired. But since the first batch was already sold, they didn\u2019t worry anymore.The official from the land division came in the morning, while Shao Yunan was still at home. Led by Zhao Lizheng, the official sent his people to measure the house site, plus ten acres of mountain land, which totaled only 98 taels, much less than Zhao Lizheng\u2019s previous estimation.The life of the people at this time was not easy, many places have been affected by disasters or suffered from the chaos of war, so a lot of land was deserted with no one to plant it. So now, land was sold cheaply. The imperial court also hoped that people would return to their hometowns to cultivate the land without fear. Seeing this, Shao Yunan immediately expanded his new homestead by one more circle and bought ten more acres of mountain land. He also bought ten acres of dry land, not far from the new house, adding an additional 46 taels. Shopkeeper Xu gave him a hundred and fifty taels of silver as thanks, so Shao Yunan was not short of money, even without touching Wang Shijing\u2019s \u2018private money.\u2019The administrator kindly reminded Shao Yunan that there would be a fine if they bought so many fields, but did not grow anything on them. The ten acres of dry land also did not have a one-year tax-free period. Shao Yunan said that he would plant the fields and pay taxes on time. However, seeing him spend more than a hundred taels of silver in one breath without blinking an eye, the administrative official seemed to know that Shao Yunan and the county magistrate seemed to have a good relationship and did not say much in the end. He immediately went to Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house to write the deed of sale in three copies, which was respectively given to Zhao Lizheng, the land department, and Shao Yunan. Wang Shijing was not at home, so Shao Yunan just pressed his own handprint and wrote his name. Zhao Lizheng didn\u2019t comment on it. Wang Shijing had said before he went up the mountain that the land for their future house land and mountains should be written down under Shao Yunan\u2019s name, since Shao Yunan was the master of their house.The administrative official took his man away. Before they left, Zhao Lizheng gave them a small jar of jam to return the favor for Shao Yunan, making the administrator immediately smile and speak more politely. Shao Yunan did not follow after Zhoa Lizheng and just took his two children home. Once inside the house, while the two children were not with him, he put the land and house deeds into the space.Wang Shijing came back in the evening and was confronted with the \u2018rumor\u2019 that his family had spent more than 140 taels of silver to buy more than 30 acres of land. Wang Shijing just ignored it and took the group of young men with full back-baskets back home. Shao Yunan, who saw that they returned with full loads, smiled so big that even his eyes bent.Wang Shijing let Wang Qing borrow a scale and weighted everything on the spot while paying money. The tea they picked was alsoLongjing. Wang Shijing asked the seven or eight young men who went with him to be paid in accordance with the grade of the tea they picked. For the best fresh leaves, Wang Shijing gave 150 copper coins per kilo and for the worst 50 copper coins per kilo. Medium quality was 80 copper coins per kilo, but Shao Yunan did not care and just gave Wang Shijing the money bag.Waiting for everyone to leave satisfied, Wang Shijing then explained, \u201cYou said the tea is best picked in the spring, so the price should be increased at that time. But since they just started tea picking there naturally will be some bad places, so I did not pay them too much. If the difference between the worst and the best is large, they will naturally try for the best in the future. You also said that as long as you make the tea, even the worst tea will be bought. The good fresh leaves are after all the minority, so I added the price for the inferior tea leaves.\u201d Shao Yunan kissed his index finger and pressed it on Wang Shijing\u2019s lips. \u201cVery business-minded. I\u2019ll leave all the tea collection to you from now on.\u201d Wang Shijing pulled Shao Yunan over and pressed his somewhat dry and cracked lips on Shao Yunan\u2019s lips. Wang Qing hurriedly pulled Nizi into the kitchen not wanting to be rude.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 53": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fierce \u201cHusband\u201dCH 27.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 27.2This trip collected a total of more than one hundred and twenty kilos of fresh leaves that could produce about thirty kilos of tea. This was also before the villagers themselves picked tea leaves to sell in the county town. Wang Shijing did not take the villagers to the west side of the mountain that was now their own. Although they had not completely bought it, he took the villagers to the other mountains in the village safe areas. They found around 40 to 50 tea trees in total scattered around the village.After picking up so many tea leaves, the night became busy again. Shao Yunan cooked dinner early, so after eating the two children went to arrange their own things, while he and Wang Shijing dealt with the tea leaves. It was not that the people in the village did not doubt why Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family started collecting red sour fruits and wild peaches, and a few families guessed whether they were making jam, but no one dared to ask Zhao Lizheng to his face. As for Wang Shijing\u2019s tea collecting, the villagers guessed that they might want to make tea to sell for money, but they doubted it. Was tea so easy to make? Tea sold by stores was so damned expensive that ordinary families could not afford to drink even the most inferior tea. So how could Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing make tea? If they were able to make it, the Wang and Shao families would already have made a lot of money.Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan closed their courtyard door and isolated themselves from any gossip. The two of them spread out the tea leaves, before Shao Yunan sprinkled the essence of the spiritual spring water by hand, and then dried the leaves, before starting the tea making process. They did not sleep for the whole night and Wang Shijing only closed his eyes for two hours in the morning before taking a bag of money and leaving. Shao Yunan wanted him to rest for a day, but he refused. He was going to Shanyang village together with Zhao He\u2019s father, since his parents would gather fruits there. Before Wang Shijing left, Shao Yunan wiped his eyes and brought him two gourds of water, especially instructing him to drink this water by himself.Wang Shijing wanted to finish harvesting and making the tea before the farming season and then find someone to build a house, while also reclaiming his newly purchased thirty acres of land and planting grains. Originally he wanted to ask the villagers for help with building his house at the end of the farming season, but it was a bit cold at that time and Wang Shijing was afraid of freezing Shao Yunan. In any case, there were many homeless people in the county town who had lost their land and came from elsewhere to look for work,\u00a0 so it was not difficult to find people. The best way was of course to spend money. Their house now was too small and poor, and Shao Yunan\u2019s dream of a big bathtub weighed on Wang Shijing\u2019s heart.Wang Shijing went out that day and rushed back the same night with freshly collected tea leaves. Shao Yunan couldn\u2019t bear to see him so tired, so when the tea was placed to dry, he drove Wang Shijing to have a rest and took care of it himself. Wang Shijing went out early and came back late every day and Shao Yunan was also very tired. Although he had spiritual spring water and spiritual essence, he didn\u2019t dare to drink it directly. In just a few days, Wang Shijing obviously lost weight, which made Shao Yunan almost mention his space. The fresh tea leaves could be put into his space first and then slowly processed, so they wouldn\u2019t have to rush.Apart from Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan, Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family could be said to be the busiest in the village. After the first day that they signed the contract with shopkeeper Xu, Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family became busy overnight, preparing three large jars of goat milk fruit jam and a large jar of peach jam. In order not to attract attention, at dawn, Zhao Yuande and Zhao He drove their cart with all four jars of jam to the county town. When Zhao Yuanqing and Li Caijuan came back, the couple joined the hustle and bustle, and after some discussion between Zhao Lizheng and Aunt Zhao Liu, they also called Zhao He\u2019s foster parents to help.Zhao He was the only son of his adoptive parents and Zhao He\u2019s adoptive father was also the only son. These two were both tight-lipped and honest, so Zhao Lizheng did not hide the matter of the jam from them. The two of them also immediately promised that they would not say anything to other people about it, so even though Zhao Lizheng still did not let them prepare the jam, they could help with the preliminary preparation work. The two\u2019s attitude reassured Zhao Lizheng and Aunt Zhao Liu, while also making Zhao He very happy. His parents\u2019 attitude made him more pleasant to his \u2018in-laws\u2019.In the midst of this busy schedule, the farming season arrived. Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family made jam and processed all the goat milk and wild peach fruit collected for Shao Yunan into jam. The sweet-scented osmanthus was not harvested by the villagers, but it was enough if they went to the mountains to pick some. Zhao Yuande was also ready to buy a few more acres of land to plant fruit trees in the spring, then use all the open land in their backyard to transplant sweet-scented osmanthus and some goat milk and fruit trees. Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family was full of confidence toward their future. The reason they were so confident was that the final tally of the sale made them think they were dreaming.They collected more than three hundred kilos of goat milk fruit and after giving some to Shao Yunan, there were still more than 200 kilos remaining. They also collected more than 100 kilos of wild peaches and all the jam made was sold. Not counting the small change, they earned 174 taels of silver. The cost of collecting the fruit, plus labor was at most 20 taels of silver, which equals a net profit of at least 150 taels of silver for Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family. After deducting Shao Yunan\u2019s 10%, there were still 135 taels in profit. In just ten days of busy work they earned 135 taels of silver! Previously if Zhao Lizheng worked hard all year round, they could earn 30 to 40 taels of silver. It was already good to earn 20 taels of silver a year, but they had now earned 135 taels of silver in just ten days! Even after paying Shao Yunan\u2019s promised 100 taels of silver, they would still have 35 silver left!Zhao Lizheng immediately felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe, causing Zhao Yuande and Zhao Yuanqing to hurriedly rub their father\u2019s chest. Aunt Zhao Liu was also so happy that she couldn\u2019t close her mouth and hurriedly asked Zhao Yuande to deliver the 100 taels of silver they owed to Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing. This time they really took advantage of Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing. They only gave Shao Yunan 50 silver at first, since they had to gather red dates and hawthorn, and were in no hurry to use the money. Zhao Yuande was also not polite and delivered the 50 taels.This jam thing will sooner or later spread. Since Yizhang Xuan restaurant\u2019s jam business opened, it was said to be very popular and always in short supply. But in the end, there were no longer any red sour fruits and other wild fruits also became almost extinct, so shopkeeper Xu had to sell a limited number daily. After getting the method to preserve freshness, when Yizhang Xuan restaurant received the jam they immediately sealed it and sent a part of the jam to the capital. Zhao Yuande, who had been following Yizhang Xuan restaurant\u2019s situation, saw that the jam was very popular and knew that the secret could not be hidden for long. So Zhao Yuande, together with his father and brother, took advantage of the fact that the people in the village had not yet realized that the jam was related to their family, to collect red dates and red hawthorn, giving a price as high as 60 copper coins for red dates and 40 copper coins for hawthorn.Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan bought a house, land, cattle, and sheep, while old lady Wang was still very upset about the money they made from selling the stones. She was both angry and anxious. Wang Zhisong tried to persuade her, but also had some hidden ideas in his heart. The two of them spent tens of hundreds of taels. If the family could give him this money, he could buy a good brush and ink, and go to the county town to buy even better books. He could even make some connections around or even enter the state school in the capital. But Wang Zhisong did not dare to ask his parents for money, and could only bide his time, while trying to persuade them.It should also be mentioned that even Wang Chunxiu was disturbed. Their family could buy a maid with this money, so she would no longer have to do this dirty and tiring work. Moreover, with so much money, how much good material and jewelry could be bought for her? She only had one silver bracelet, which she had begged her mother for a long time before she bought it for her. But that little bitch Wang Nizi was wearing white jade earrings!Their whole family was suffering when they saw Wang Shijing spend so much money on collecting tea leaves. Although it was said outside that Shao Yunan sold a good idea and made money, no one in the Wang family believed it. How could Shao Yunan, who was born in a farming family, sell an idea for so much money? If he really had such good ideas, the Shao family would have earned money a long time ago and would not allow Shao Yunan to be married out. So the Wang family was still convinced that the money Wang Shijing spent was the money he privately saved or got from selling the stones.The more they thought about it, the more old lady Wang wanted to complain to Wang Wenhe. She didn\u2019t dare to go to Zhao Lizheng since she was scolded by Zhao Lizheng last time and knew that Zhao Lizheng would definitely not side with her. Since Wang Guo was not there, old lady Wang took Wang Chunxiu with her. This time, they had to get some money out of that family\u2019s hands!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why don\u2019t you wait until the farming season is over!\u201d It was the busiest time of the year for every family and Wang Qian, who didn\u2019t like old lady Wang\u2019s family, was furious when she saw them. Wang Chunxiu pulled her mother\u2019s hand and said, \u201cAuntie, my mother and I are looking for the patriarch for something, so we had no choice but to come here.\u201dWang Qian said, \u201cWhat for? Are you here to ask for money again or to ask for someone to plant your land? I will say it, so Chunxiu you should also talk to your brother Wang Zhisong. Your second brother and sister-in-law are not here, but you can\u2019t expect others to do all the work in the field for you. My grandchild Wang Yan is only 10 years old, but he still knows how to help in the field. Your younger brother is old enough to be married, so what\u2019s the point of hiding at home during the busy season? You are also of marriageable age, not to mention helping with the work, you should also have time to run the house. Otherwise your family will not be able to have spring grain.\u201dWang Wenhe was not at home, so Wang Qian did not give old lady Wang and Wang Chunxiu any face. Wang Chunxiu was not able to reply, so old lady Wang directly said, \u201cThe patriarch is not here, so I will go to the field to look for him.\u201d\u201cGo ahead and go.\u201d Wang Qian was so annoyed with them that she immediately drove them away.After meeting with Wang Qian, old lady Wang\u2019s expression was dark and sullen as she took Wang Chunxiu to the field to look for Wang Wenhe. Halfway there, she ran into Wang Wenhe, who was returning home. Wang Wenhe also heard from others that old lady Wang had taken Wang Chunxiu to his house, so he was hurrying back.As soon as they saw Wang Wenhe, Wang Chunxiu began to wipe her tears and old lady Wang also began to cry, making the surrounding farmers look over. Wang Wenhe was already impatient and brought them home while suppressing his temper. Wang Qian, who saw it, looked at them from the courtyard and scolded the two of them for not worrying about the busy farming season. Old lady Wang and Wang Chunxiu pretended not to hear her. But Wang Wenhe, whose time was also precious during the busy season, opened his mouth and asked, \u201cWhat is it again? The farming season is busy. Why do I only see one person working on your family\u2019s fields?\u201dOld lady Wang immediately cried and wiped her tears. \u201cPatriarch, you have to find someone to help my family. What can Chunxiu and I do now that we are the only laborers in our family?\u201d Wang Wenhe said with a black face, \u201cWhy can\u2019t Chunxiu do anything? She is not a young lady of a big family. At this point can she still expect to become a young lady in the future? Whose daughter in the village doesn\u2019t work in the field? When Wang Nizi was around, she had to help out in the field, but her Aunt can\u2019t do it?\u201dWang Chunxiu couldn\u2019t hold back any longer and her tears began to drip one by one. Wang Wenhe was unwilling to let Wang Zhisong work in the fields, but he was very dismissive of Wang Chunxiu, who obviously came from a farming family, but still wanted to act like the rich lady. But old lady Wang\u2019s face has always been invincible, so she only cried harder as she spoke. \u201cEven if Chunxiu goes to work in the fields, how much work can she do? I would also have to pay her medical fee if she becomes exhausted. Patriarch, I don\u2019t want to make a scene, but there is no one in my family who can work in the fields and no one who can help our family. But that family just bought a house and land, and also bought cattle and sheep. Even if they give me just 10 taels of silver I can go and hire people. He has money to give to the villagers, but not to me, his mother?\u201dWang Chunxiu echoed, \u201cMy elder brother just spent quite a few taels of silver. If it hadn\u2019t been for him, my second brother and sister-in-law would be able to work in the field now, so it wouldn\u2019t be so difficult for our family.\u201d Wang Wenhe held onto his anger and finally squeezed out a sentence. \u201cThose people work for Shijing, so Shijing has to pay them. What does that have to do with giving you money? Are you going to deny the separation deed again? Do you still not have enough trouble?\u201d Wang Chunxiu said, \u201cHow can this be trouble? No matter how the deed was written, can he really disown his parents? He can ignore me and Wang Zhisong, but he shouldn\u2019t be able to ignore his own parents!\u201dWang Wenhe stared at old lady Wang and said, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t make a fuss about taking back the field and the house, would Wang Shijing have left you alone? Once the field and the house were taken away, you became unreasonable even if you were reasonable. If Wang Shijing were to act according to the deed, how can you ask him for money?\u201d Without even thinking about it, old lady Wang said, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I asked the patriarch to write, I didn\u2019t agree to this separation at all.\u201dWang Wenhe almost spat out a mouthful of blood. While Wang Qian kicked the door and pointed at old lady Wang scolding her. \u201cYou shameless old woman. How did you give birth to such a bunch of shameless people? You drove your own son out of the house and now you look for my family because you want his money. You old wench, why don\u2019t you just die?\u201d Wang Qian came up with a broom to beat her, making old lady Wang and Wang Chunxiu frightened by Wang Qian\u2019s attitude. Old lady Wang shouted, \u201cPatriarch! Control this crazy woman!\u201d Wang Wenhe\u2019s hand was shaking, but unexpectedly he did not yell at his wife, as the broom in Wang Qian\u2019s hand struck old lady Wang and Wang Chunxiu mercilessly. Seeing that the patriarch did not care, old lady Wang grabbed the frightened Wang Chunxiu and ran out, while Wang Qian chased them all the way out. While Wang Wenhe slumped down on the stool, covered his face, and let out a long sigh.Wang Qian beat old lady Wang and Wang Chunxiu so much that even the other people in the village started paying attention. But Wang Qian was not finished. Crossing her arms around her chest, she began to scold them, making the villagers aware of what was going on. A person in the field driving cattle found Wang Dali as soon as he heard the gossip, who with a bent back continued to work in silence.Old lady Wang and Wang Chunxiu ran home in a state of distress, making Wang Zhisong immediately ask them what happened. Once he heard that the two not only looked for the patriarch\u2019s support to no avail, but was also beaten by Wang Qian, Wang Zhisong\u2019s expression became quite gloomy, taking several deep breaths. He was secretly supportive of his mother\u2019s action, but on the surface he could only continue to persuade them not to go to Wang Shijing to ask for money. Since they couldn\u2019t do it, their family should pay some money to the clan\u2019s people to ask for their help with the fields. But as soon as old lady Wang heard this, she refused. It was only right for the people of the clan to help. Why should they give them money?Now there was only Wang Dali plus a cow working in the field, while neither Wang Zhisong nor Wang Chunxiu wanted to help. Old lady Wang did not dare to bother the patriarch for the time being and would like to go to Wang Shijing to let out her frustrations, but there was still Shao Yunan. She was afraid that Shao Yunan would go to the county school again to make trouble, really finishing Wang Zhisong this time. Thinking about it for some time, old lady Wang finally asked Wang Chunxiu to go to Wang Shijing to ask for money. Wang Chunxiu was after all a girl and his younger sister. As soon as she heard this, Wang Chunxiu said she would rather die. She was really afraid that Shao Yunan would spread a rumor around that she was trying to seduce him.Wang Chunxiu refused to go, however they had no choice but to do the work in the field. Otherwise, what would their family eat and drink next year? Old lady Wang was very angry and in the end she dragged Wang Chunxiu and Wang Zaizheng out and pulled Wang Zhisong in, asking them to go to the fields together. Old lady Wang didn\u2019t want Wang Zhisong to become too tired. How could a person who would be a future first place winner do something as lowly as farm work? When Wang Chunxiu cried and refused to go, old lady Wang gave her a slap and dragged her together with Wang Zaizheng, who also cried and refused to go to the fields.The Wang family\u2019s affair became a joke again. Wang Wenhe was angry, but when he saw that Wang Dali was the only one in the Wang family\u2019s field, along with old lady Wang, Wang Chunxiu, and Wang Zaizheng he called over people in the clan to help them, in his capacity as head of the clan. But to his surprise, not only was no one willing to help, but the people he thought wouldn\u2019t be able to decline, flatly refused. Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family paid them for red dates and hawthorn gathering, so all the families had to divide their manpower to pick red dates and hawthorn. There were also families who originally weren\u2019t from Xiushui Village who needed to go back home to help with their own fields.Wang Shijing\u2019s family paid them to help collect tea leaves, allowing many families to earn some money, so they really couldn\u2019t spare any manpower. Helping with old lady Wang\u2019s fields not only gave them no income, it didn\u2019t even give them a mouthful of water.\u00a0So if they had time for extra work, they might as well gather red dates and hawthorn to exchange for money.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But this time, the clan was not willing to listen to him and several clan elders did not even step forward. Their families also needed to earn money. Who did not want to earn money and send their own child to study? If their child could study well, would they still care about Wang Zhisong? Wang Wenhe had not yet realized that the clan was no longer willing to listen to some of his unreasonable requests, because old lady Wang\u2019s family was really not liked. In fact, if Wang Zhisong was willing to come forward and be polite to the people, some people in the village and clan would still be willing to help. But when Wang Zhisong came back, not to mention being polite with the clan, he was like an eldest daughter who didn\u2019t go out of the door and didn\u2019t walk out of the house. He also didn\u2019t show up for any event that happened at home, so how could anyone still show favor and give him face.Looking at his father\u2019s instantly hunched figure, Wang Shuping could no longer bear it and persuaded his father to return home. After returning home that night, Wang Shuping once again talked to his father properly. Letting his father understand that the villager\u2019s dissatisfaction with the Wang family was not only because of Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan. The attitude of the clan members said everything. Now there were only two ways in front of old lady Wang\u2019s family: either finish planting the land by themselves or spend money to hire people. They should also forget about getting money from Wang Shijing. Even if Wang Shijing was willing to give it, Shao Yunan would never give it. Did he not see that Wang Shijing paid for the tea leaves collection from money given by Shao Yunan? The two of them were married for a short period of time, but who still did not know that in Wang Shijing\u2019s family, Shao Yunan held the power?Wang Wenhe was both depressed and frustrated. It would also be false to say that he was not frustrated with old lady Wang, if nothing else old lady Wang called his wife a crazy woman. Making Wang Wenhe furious, but he was after all the patriarch of the Wang clan. In the end, Wang Wenhe gave Wang Shuping three taels of silver and asked him to give it to old lady Wang so she could hire people to work on the fields. It made Wang Qian so angry that she cried, so Wang Shuping hastily pulled his mother out. Wang Shuping\u2019s wife also had an opinion on this matter, but couldn\u2019t speak against her father-in-law, so she simply hid in the house.Wang Shuping persuaded his mother to not be angry and that his father would figure out this matter one day. Wang Qian listened to her son\u2019s opinion the most, so when her son persuaded her, she finally stopped crying and though still unhappy went inside the house. Wang Shuping sighed and went to deliver the money alone. Wang Shuping\u2019s son Wang Yan, ran out of the house after his father left and went to Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house to find Zhao Congbo.When Wang Shuping gave old lady Wang three taels of silver, he also told her about both options, which was to do all the farm work with their own family members or hire outside people to help them. Old lady Wang accepted the money with a smile, in contrast to Wang Shuping\u2019s gloomy expression, during which Wang Zhisong still did not show up, not to mention a word of gratitude. Wang Dali, who was embarrassed, tried to give it back, but was pushed back by old lady Wang\u2019s glare. Then Wang Shuping left with a dark expression. When he returned home, he asked his wife to take three taels of silver from their private property and secretly give it to his mother.Wang Shuping was not separated from his family, but Wang Wenhe and Wang Qian did not mind that their son and daughter-in-law had private money. After all, their son and daughter-in-law often used their private money to subsidize their family. Wang Qian accepted the money, but put it away for money saved for her grandson. She could see that her husband\u2019s money would not be safe before he could figure out this situation, so while Wang Wenhe was still outside, Wang Qian changed all the hiding places of their family silver, not letting Wang Wenhe find even a single coin.The joke about the Wang family only reached Shao Yunan\u2019s ears on the third day or rather when fourth Aunt Wang told him about it when she came to deliver fresh tea leaves. The farming season began, but Wang Shijing was not busy going to the fields, since Shao Yunan wanted to let him rest. Their family also had a large stock of goat milk fruit to make wine, so Wang Shijing\u2019s focus was not on planting. Planting for a few days at night would also be fine. After making the fruit wine, he went to the county town to find someone to build a house and then hired a few short term workers to plant their land.Wang Xing, Sun Erjiang, Sun Xiaojiang, and Wang Zhuanghua followed Wang Shijing all this time. Fourth Aunt Wang\u2019s mother\u2019s home was away from Xiushui village, so Wang Shijing didn\u2019t go there to gather tea leaves. But Aunt Wang still asked Wang Xing to go there, not to mention wherever he could pick tea. The art of tea picking was taught to her by her mother\u2019s family, so in the future, even if she was no longer part of her mother\u2019s family, she could have some income. Wang Shijing said that he would collect tea every spring. Wang Xing went back for three days and took his Uncles from his mother\u2019s side to the mountain to look for tea and they really found more than a dozen tea trees. After picking the tea, Wang Xing hurried back and as soon as he came back, fourth Aunt Wang asked him to rest while she herself went to deliver the tea.Wang Xing did not pick much, there were only about 30 kilos of fresh tea leaves and there weren\u2019t many good quality ones. Auntie Wang did not ask Shao Yunan for money. She just wanted to let him know that her mother\u2019s side of the family also had tea, so next year she could ask them to pick it and send it over. Shao Yunan bought more than 30 kilos of fresh tea leaves from Aunt Wang at the price of 80 copper coins per kilo, which made fourth Aunt Wang feel very embarrassed. During the chat between the two, Aunt Wang also told Shao Yunan what happened at old lady Wang\u2019s house.Shao Yunan said without a smile, \u201cThey won\u2019t be able to get even one copper coin from my house. Wang Shijing doesn\u2019t have any money on him, so if they want some, they would need to come to me.\u201dAunt Wang laughed happily. \u201cI don\u2019t think they would dare. If you went to the county school again, Wang Zhisong wouldn\u2019t be able to study anymore.\u201d If you ask her, Shao Yunan\u2019s action was really ruthless and relieved part of her anger. After laughing, Aunt Wang hesitated for a moment. Seeing this Shao Yunan asked, \u201cFourth Aunt, what can I do for you? Just say it.\u201dAunt Wang hesitated for a long time and quietly asked, \u201cYunan, Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family gathered so many sour red fruit and wild peaches. Are they the ones who made the jam? I heard that some people in the county town began to buy jam and that the price of it is very high.\u201d Sure enough, it has already started to spread. Shao Yunan decided to no longer keep it a secret and said, \u201cMm-hmm. I sold the method of making jam to Uncle Zhao and now they have signed a contract with Yizhang Xuan restaurant to sell it.\u201dFourth Aunt Wang became silent. She didn\u2019t say much about it, but she was a little upset for sure, so Shao Yunan smiled and said, \u201dAuntie, I wanted to ask Wang Shijing to come to you and tell you something when the farmers are less busy. But if you ask, I\u2019ll tell you the truth first. When I sold this jam recipe to Uncle Zhao, I actually asked Uncle Zhao to take the lead for us. Only in this way can we make money.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Fourth Aunt Wang was so stunned that even her heartbeat slowed down by half a beat. Shao Yunan said, \u201cShijing and I, actually figured out a lot of ways to make money and we were actually going to make jam ourselves, but my family\u2019s lack of manpower makes this jam too troublesome to make. I can make it as a snack on weekdays, but it would be too exhausting to do it as a business with only Shijing. In addition, my family is not strong enough to attract too much attention now. If we made money by selling jam, not to mention old lady Wang\u2019s family, we would also have to take into account the thoughts of the ordinary people in the village. Shijing and I are still weak, so we can\u2019t bear it right now. I discussed this matter with Wang Shijing and sold the jam recipe to Uncle Zhao. Uncle Zhao\u2019s family made money which makes many people jealous, but who would dare to mess with Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family?\u201dFourth Aunt Wang nodded. \u201cWhen Uncle Zhao takes care of the villagers, we will follow closely behind to earn money and it will be much safer. Wang Shijing and I collected so many tea leaves because in fact we want to be in the tea business. But this tea-making craft is our secret, so we can\u2019t sell it. But we have ideas for some other small business, which will be available for other families in the future. We will keep in mind those who were kind to our family, so we can repay them. Now it\u2019s the busy farming period, so even If I wanted to teach you something, I don\u2019t have the time to do so. Why not wait till the end of the busy farming season, so we can sit down and have a discussion with several friendly families.\u201d Aunt Wang\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cYunan, are you telling the truth?\u201d\u201cOf course. If I wasn\u2019t afraid that fourth Aunt would have lost control over it, you would be the first person I would give the recipe for the jam to.\u201d Fourth Aunt Wang immediately felt guilty. \u201cYunan, don\u2019t think like that. Fourth Aunt is just asking. After you and Wang Shijing got married, you have helped our family a lot. Fourth Aunt is also not greedy for money that we shouldn\u2019t earn.\u201dShao Yunan said, \u201cFourth Aunt, it\u2019s not a big deal for one or two families in the village to get rich, but it\u2019s necessary for most people to become rich. Not to mention, if every family has money, would we still need to count on Wang Zhisong? Even if not for ourselves, for the sake of our future generations, we must find a way to earn money. Fourth Aunt, Shijing and I are not only doing this to repay kindness, but also for our own sake. If there are more people with money in this village, there won\u2019t be so much focus on our family. Auntie, can you help me pass these words to Uncle Sun, Zhuanghua, Auntie Zhou and the others? When the busy farming period is over I will treat everyone to dinner.\u201d Fourth Aunt Wang wiped the corners of her eyes. \u201cHey! Hey! Fourth Aunt will no longer be polite with you. Fourth Aunt will follow you and Shijing and earn money, living a good life and later when Wang Xing has a son we will send him to study.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d Fourth Aunt Wang left very excited. Wang Qing and Wang Nizi were listening through the door, so Wang Qing quickly came over and said, \u201cLittle father, I will study hard and get a place in the exams.\u201d Shao Yunan snickered as he stroked Wang Qing\u2019s head. \u201cWhy did you suddenly come up with such words?\u201d Wang Qing pursed his lips and just said, \u201cIf I earn reputation, little father will not have to be afraid of others taking notice of our family and earn money in peace. We also wouldn\u2019t need to be afraid of little Uncle.\u201d Shao Yunan with a \u2018hahaha\u2019 said, \u201cGood! Ambitious! Our family will depend on you in the future, so you should study hard. If you don\u2019t study properly, little father will hit you on the back of your hand.\u201d\u201cI will study hard!\u201d Wang Nizi followed his example and said, \u201cLittle father, you should teach me crafts as well, so I can earn money in the future.\u201d Shao Yunan couldn\u2019t help but pick up Wang Nizi and pinch her face. \u201cGood. When Nizi grows up, little father will teach you how to spend and make money. In the future, we will have our own business, so if your future husband dares to disobey, we will deduct his money and make him a poor man.\u201d Wang Nizi blushed, but Shao Yunan with laughter, just pinched her face. \u201cWhen your father finishes his work, we will take you to the county town to buy some more jewelry and some nice clothes, so we can dress our Nizi into a little beauty.\u201d When Shao Yunan previously came back from the county town, he let Aunt Zhao pierce Nizi\u2019s ears. Wearing jewelry for the first time and such beautiful white jade earrings at that, Nizi didn\u2019t dare to sleep.Wang Nizi was so overwhelmed that she buried her head in her little father\u2019s arms, refusing to come out and making her little father laugh again. This time Wang Qing also laughed. Even when both of his birth parents were around, he and Nizi were never this happy. Wang Qing liked his little father very much and hoped that he would never leave and abandon him and Nizi like their mother.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The farmers were busy and everyone\u2019s cattle had to be used. The calf in their family was still small and could not pull a cart, but it was also not good to borrow from others so he could only walk to the county town, not letting Shao Yunan go with him. When he came back, he had rented an ox cart in the county town because he bought a few things, mainly farm tools and vegetables, as well as some grain.All tea leaves were already jarred and the goat milk fruit collected by Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family were already brewed into fruit wine, so they just had to wait till it was ready. This time Wang Shijing went to the county town to find someone to help him build a house and hire people for farm work. He could work on the vegetable field to be reclaimed in his family\u2019s yard by himself, so there was no need to hire another person for that.Wang Shijing had been there the day before and he had found the right person. Uncle Zhou and Uncle Wang dad were both good at building houses, but Uncle Zhou was not well and their family farm work was done mainly by Zhou Tianbao, who was very busy. Uncle Zhou was unable to help due to his health and Uncle Wang\u2019s dad was too old, so after thinking about it Wang Shijing decided to let Uncle Zhou and Uncle Wang\u2019s dad work as supervisors, paying them 50 copper coins each per day, not including food.Wang Shijing first found a craftsman in the county to build the house. Shao Yunan\u2019s requirements were very specific, so he had to find a talented craftsman. The craftsman himself had people working under him, but Wang Shijing planned to build a large house with many rooms, so he hired more than 20 refugees from the flood-stricken area in the south. These refugees lost their land and gathered outside the city to find work. Wang Shijing contacted the leader of this group of people, and finding him quite reliable he settled the matter. 60 copper coins per day of work, excluding room and board. The wages of craftsmen were calculated separately. Since it was the busy farming period in the village they couldn\u2019t find people from the village to help with cooking and it was also impossible for Wang Shijing to let Shao Yunan cook for more than 30 people every day. It would be too tiring.Usually, if you hired people to build a house and cover food and accommodation, the day salary was only 30 copper coins at most. But because Wang Shijing was in a hurry and because his offer did not include food and accommodation, he decided to directly raise the wages. No one was reluctant and they all said that they would do a good job and build the house within two months at most, according to Wang Shijing\u2019s requirements. Wang Shijing first gave the craftsman and the boss of the refugees two taels of silver each. If the house was built without any problems, he would pay the remaining wages. It was also done to avoid someone deliberately delaying his work and not doing a good job.On the other hand, Wang Shijing looked for short-term field laborers in the county town. Also paying 60 copper coins per day of work, without food and housing. He also rented a plow cow, paying a small deposit first, the rest would be settled after the work was finished. Wang Shijing originally intended to hire six people, but some villagers approached him that were willing to help with his family\u2019s farm work, so he hired less people in the end.When Wang Shijing came back he explained the matter to Shao Yunan, but Shao Yunan just said that it was Wang Shijing who was in charge of this matter. As long as he could build the house in accordance with his vision, it was good. In fact, Wang Shijing\u2019s approach to this situation now was to find a design company, then find a construction team, and then hire two supervisors. Hiring two supervisors was also quite easy, since Uncle Zhou and Father Wang felt that Wang Shijing was completely helping them and automatically took over the job of helping Wang Shijing select wood, bricks, and other materials. Wang Shijing was not really familiar with this area, so very trustingly he took out hundred taels of silver and handed it to the two Uncles.Shao Yunan was very much looking forward to this new house and discussed the drawings with Wang Shijing and their two children for two days. He planned to build a three-way courtyard house, with living rooms, bedrooms, guest rooms, kitchen, bathrooms, dining room, and other functional rooms. It also had to have a garden, vegetable plots, and barns. Shao Yunan used the classical courtyard he had seen before to design this house. Looking at the design made by Shao Yunan,Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing looked forward to their new house, not to mention their two children.In ancient times, there was no cement, so houses were mostly made of wood and brick. But Shao Yunan decided to let someone else worry about the main material for building the house, since he didn\u2019t intend to become involved in building houses or planting. He was busy and when he finished doing his own thing, he paid close attention to Wang Qing and Wang Nizi\u2019s studies. Wang Shijing was in charge of other things. The negotiated construction team and short term workers would arrive the next day, so after eating dinner, Wang Shijing went to Uncle Zhou and Uncle Wang\u2019s father with the drawing. He had to confirm a lot of things. He was so busy that he didn\u2019t even have time to have a good chat with Shao Yunan.When Wang Shijing came back, Shao Yunan was in Wang Qing and Wang Nizi\u2019s room telling idiom stories to the two children. Shao Yunan did not intend to let the two children learn in a step-by-step manner like other children, so he developed a learning program for the two children that was a combination of both modern and ancient education. If they went to a private school and studied, Shao Yunan would consider adding more educational ideas, so that the two children not only learned how to read, but also how to study.Wang Shijing, who walked outside the door, did not immediately push the door open and just quietly listened to Shao Yunan tell the children a story. Wang Qing and Wang Nizi listened with fascination. The two children were not yet literate, but the stories told by their little father were very interesting and the truths in the stories were easy to understand. They could also learn idioms after listening to these stories. Wang Qing didn\u2019t know what the teachers of private schools were like, but he felt that his little father must be better than them.Shao Yunan heard the courtyard door rattle, but how come no one made a sound for a long time? He stopped the story and shouted, \u201cWho is it? Is it Shijing?\u201d Both Wang Qing and Wang Nizi looked in the direction of the door. Did their father come back? Wang Shijing at the door swallowed before replaying. \u201cWell, I\u2019m back.\u201d Saying that, he pushed the door in and entered the room. Shao Yunan did not notice any abnormality and only asked, \u201dHow was it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all settled. Uncle Zhou and Uncle Wang\u2019s father will go to choose the materials tomorrow, saying that it would all be ready made. Those who come tomorrow will lay the foundation first. I also have someone to pay attention to the field side, I will prepare the vegetable field as soon as I am done with the house.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When dad finishes preparing the land and plants the seeds, you and Nizi will be in charge of the vegetable field.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d Shao Yunan stared at Wang Shijing for a moment and then began to say, \u201cQing, Nizi, little father will finish telling you the story. Tomorrow, Qing will repeat the story while Nizi will memorize the idioms and meanings. Little father will check after breakfast.\u201d\u201cGood!\u201d The two children immediately concentrated on listening to the story again, while Wang Shijing went out to wash his hands and face. He then returned and sat behind Shao Yunan and listened quietly to his story. After finishing the story and checking the words the two children had learned in the past few days, Shao Yunan left them to review on their own and went back to the other room with Wang Shijing. As soon as they entered the door, Shao Yunan asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I can see you are not very happy.\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s face immediately sank a little, then he looked at Shao Yunan and asked, \u201cNo one came to ask you for money again?\u201dWhen he asked this, Shao Yunan knew what was wrong. Smiling, he raised his hand and wrapped it around Wang Shijing\u2019s neck and asked,\u00a0 \u201cDid you know that the two women of your family were beaten out by the patriarch\u2019s wife?\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s expression immediately improved. He picked up Shao Yunan by his butt and took a few steps to sit down on the bed, before replying. \u201cAunt Zhou told me. They didn\u2019t come to you, did they?\u201d Shao Yunan raised the corners of his mouth and said, \u201cWould they dare?\u201d He then took off Wang Shijing\u2019s blindfold and threw it aside. Wang Shijing\u2019s adam\u2019s apple moved as he gulped. \u201dWife\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d Shao Yunan pretended not to know what Wang Shijing meant as he rubbed Wang Shijing\u2019s throat with his fingers. Wang Shijing swallowed and moved over for a kiss. \u201cQing and Nizi are still studying.\u201d Avoiding Wang Shijing\u2019s kiss, Shao Yunan irresponsibly jumped down from Wang Shijing and said, \u201cBoil water for me. I want to take a bath.\u201d The look in Wang Shijing\u2019s one eye was very deep as he stood up and grabbed Shao Yunan to kiss him. Recently he was so busy that he had no time to make out with his wife.After Wang Qing and Wang Nizi reviewed the content of today\u2019s lesson, Wang Qing went to the kitchen to boil water, ready to wash up before going to bed. But when he stepped into the kitchen there was no water in the cauldron, Wang Qing filled it before lighting the firewood. He wanted to borrow the oil lamp that was in his father and little father\u2019s room, but standing in front of the closed door of their room, he thought for a moment before shouting from outside the door. \u201cFather, little father, I will go to sleep with Nizi first. I started boiling the water.\u201d\u201cAlright, go to sleep first.\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s voice was muffled and unnatural, making Wang Qing wonder if his father was in a bad mood.\u00a0 He also heard what happened in the old house during the day when Aunt Wang was telling little father about it, so after standing in front of the door for a while, Wang Qing went back to check on the boiling water. With father and little father around, no one would dare to come over and make trouble.In the room, Shao Yunan clutched his mouth with one hand and clasped Wang Shijing\u2019s muscular shoulder with the other, slapping him hard from time to time. The heavy gasp added another warmth to the room that was otherwise not warm enough, as Wang Shijing\u2019s two hands caressed Shao Yunan\u2019s back. His mouth and tongue were also not idle, as they left countless marks on Shao Yunan\u2019s otherwise white body. Shao Yunan never asked if Wang Shijing also acted like this when he was in bed with Song, but since they started having an \u2018amorous affair\u2019, Wang Shijing was always eager to kiss and bite him all over, especially in certain places.The two children were still awake and the house was not soundproof, so Shao Yunan did not dare to make any sounds. But Wang Shijing did not restrain himself and even intensified his actions. He didn\u2019t know if it was because he was holding himself back so much, but on several occasions he could hardly help poking his iron rod into Shao Yunan\u2019s wet secret place.The oil lamp in Wang Qing and Wang Nizi\u2019s room went out, while the hot water left by Wang Qing in the kitchen cauldron gradually lost its temperature. In the master bedroom, suppressed moans no longer spilled out of the empty space and after a long time the room calmed down. After a while a tall man in a single robe and pants came out of the room and entered the kitchen. The fire that had been extinguished was lit again, as the man added water to the cauldron. After the water boiled, he first brought the big wooden basin for washing clothes into the house and then brought a bucket of hot water and a bucket of cold water into the house.The house had a strong masculine smell as Shao Yunan sat helplessly in the wooden basin, while Wang Shijing washed him. Wang Shijing\u2019s expression was content, while Shao Yunan\u2019s was resentful. His chest was swollen and sore, and his lips were hot and numb, but he could not see even a single bloody mark on Wang Shijing\u2019s shoulder that he had previously scratched. Shao Yunan stared with his big eyes infected with lust and accused someone of being too excessive.Wang Shijing honestly washed someone and wrapped a large cloth towel around someone before putting him into the bed. Then he hastily cleaned himself in the water basin and took it out. After cleaning everything up, he then returned to the bed and hugged the person who had not yet let go of his anger into his arms with a sigh of relief.\u201cHave you never eaten meat or drunk milk?\u201d Shao Yunan\u2019s hand dangerously grabbed Wang Shijing\u2019s precious parts through his pants, making Wang Shijing hurriedly hold his hand and move it away. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me here my wife or I won\u2019t be able to help myself.\u201d\u201cYour ex-wife absolutely couldn\u2019t stand you and ran away!\u201d Speaking of his ex-wife, Wang Shijing was not the least bit sad as he just kissed Shao Yunan. \u201cSeeing your body, I can\u2019t help but want that. To others\u2026 I never felt this way. I didn\u2019t feel anything when I saw someone doing it in the barracks, but I really want to do it with you.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s my fault?\u201d Wang Shijing hurriedly stroked his hair. \u201cWife, wife\u2026\u201d he murmured, gently kissing Shao Yunan\u2019s lips and licking them. After marrying this person, the more time they spent together, the more he couldn\u2019t let go. He knew his wife was in pain, but he just couldn\u2019t help it. He hated not being able to do more and hated being unable to take his wife wholly, so he would be completely his alone. He never before felt such a strong desire for monopolization. Wang Shijing wanted to change, but could not do anything about it.Shao Yunan had not yet realized that he had become easily softened by Wang Shijing\u2019s trust. Perhaps it was because of deeper physical communication or maybe Wang Shijing, an ancient man, did not bind him with the kind of ancient pedantry he thought he would have, but instead gave him purpose and support. This allowed him to quickly integrate into his new identity and new environment.Wang Shijing did not go any further and just caressed his wife\u2019s smooth hair, before backing away and touching his wife\u2019s smooth naked back to finally feel inner peace.\u201cWife, I won\u2019t give any money to my family. It\u2019s up to you to decide whether to give it or not. \u201cWang Shijing has completely lost his heart. As a son, brother, and human, it was inconvenient for him to say it directly, so he just simply handed it over to Shao Yunan, letting others think he was completely under his wife\u2019s control.\u201cAll you have to do is show your attitude. When there are weddings and funerals over there, how much they give and how much I give. The most important are Wang Qing and Nizi. I\u2019m not afraid of what people say, but I don\u2019t know if you can stand up to the pressure of the clan and others. Anyway, I\u2019ve thought about it. If it becomes a big deal, our family will simply move to the county town.\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s attitude was clear. \u201cI can\u2019t compromise for the sake of Qing and Nizi, otherwise people from my family will start wanting more and more. The most important thing for me to do is to hold power over Qing and Nizi\u2019s marriage in my own hands. If I didn\u2019t separate from that family, Qing and Nizi\u2019s marriage would have been decided by my mother and then they really would have ruined their future.\u201d\u201cYou did the right thing.\u201d Shao Yunan gave Wang Shijing a kiss as a reward. As long as you don\u2019t feel ashamed, just say in public that I am the one in charge of our family and that you can\u2019t control me.\u201d Wang Shijing said indifferently, \u201cYou are really the one who is in charge of our family.\u201d It\u2019s been a long time since the two of them had such a leisurely chat. Shao Yunan talked with Wang Shijing, while in his broad, muscular arms for some time, until his voice quietened and his breathing stabilized. Wang Shijing then tightened his embrace and lightly kissed Shao Yunan\u2019s face. It was really good that he married this person.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The villagers were busy with farming, while Wang Shijing\u2019s family only spent money to hire people from outside to plant their land and build a house. Although they didn\u2019t include food and housing, the proposed day\u2019s wage was still a lot, making many people jealous. But then, the news of Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family selling jam came out. It was said that the county town\u2019s biggest restaurant sold the jam made by Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family and it was very popular! They heard that even a small jar of goat milk jam was sold for three taels of silver! While peach jam was even more expensive! But there were still many people who wanted to, but couldn\u2019t buy such expensive jam! Since when did Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family sell their jam so quietly?As soon as the news got out, Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family didn\u2019t shield themselves from it. Aunt Zhao Liu also graciously told the villagers that their jam was sold by their family to the Yizhang Xuan restaurant and that the jam recipe was bought by their family from Shao Yunan for 300 taels of silver, making them borrow money from various places to pay him. Not only that, they also had to give Shao Yunan 20% of the profit. Whoever was dissatisfied could also spend money to buy the jam recipe from Shao Yunan\u2019s hands. Also, the deal with Yizhang Xuan restaurant was also negotiated by Shao Yunan for them, so their family had to pay him extra.But no one dared to go to Shao Yunan to confirm Aunt Zhao Liu\u2019s words. Fourth Aunt Wang who had a good relationship with Shao Yunan\u2019s family also came forward to confirm that this was indeed the case. Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan had no land, so they had to find a way to make money. Fortunately, Shao Yunan was very capable and sold some mysterious stones to the Butterfly Jewelry Pavilion instead of a pawn shop. He also sold some ideas to the porcelain store and earned some extra money. The red sour fruit and wild peaches that no one bought, but could be gathered for free on the mountain, was also turned into jam that could be sold for a lot of money. It was no wonder that after separating from his family, Wang Shijing was able to buy a cartload of goods every time he went to the county town and was also able to quickly buy land for their new house and fields. It could be said that Wang Shijing really married the right wife.Most of the villagers were silenced since they could not get three hundred taels of silver to buy the jam recipe. It was no wonder Yizhang Xuan restaurant was so expensive. Of course, there were still people who spoke negative things. Most of them did not dare to say them directly about Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family, so they said it about Shao Yunan, who married into Xiushui Village. If he had spread the jam recipe to everyone, everyone in Xiushui Village would be able to earn money. Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan completely ignored this kind of talk, since both of them didn\u2019t have much contact with these families.But there were still some thick-skinned people who looked for fourth Aunt Wang and other people who had a good relationship with Wang Shijing\u2019s family, asking them if Shao Yunan could sell them the jam recipe for a cheaper price. Shao Yunan just replied that they should first check if Zhao Lizheng would agree with that. Besides, the contract signed by Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family stated that the jam could only be made by Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family, so who would have the ability to make Zhao Lizheng change the contract? Who would pay for it? In this way most people gave up on this idea.But there was something even weirder. Two families carried a piece of meat and rice to Wang Shijing\u2019s door to find Wang Shijing. After a few words of courtesy, they told Wang Shijing, who collected so much tea, that they wanted to also make tea. Can they teach them and they would pay for the recipe? The man was called Wang Dafu and the woman\u2019s name was Chen Xiang. To sum it up, Wang Shijing had to call Wang Dafu\u2019s father, Wang Benchang, third Uncle. So this Wang Dafu could also be called his cousin. Shao Yunan had no impression of this family at all, but the fact that they could so brazenly use family friendship with a piece of meat and a bag of rice in exchange for the tea making method was just \u2018shrewdness\u2019. Shao Yunan really wanted to spit in their faces. It was really comparable to old lady Wang\u2019s shamelessness.Wang Shijing did not say anything. It was Shao Yunan who spoke. \u201cShijing, how come your Wang clan is full of oddballs with thicker skins than the city walls?\u201d Wang Dafu and Chen Xiang\u2019s expressions immediately darkened, but Wang Dafu suppressed his temper and only said, \u201cShijing\u2019s wife, how can you say something like this? Aren\u2019t we from the same family? Shouldn\u2019t families help each other?\u201c Chen Xiang also followed his lead and added, \u201cShijing, according to reason, you should not have sold the jam making method to Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family, but to our clan patriarch. How can you let money that should belong to the Wang clan, be earned by outsiders?\u201d\u201cWho is a family with you? Who is a clan with you?\u201d Shao Yunan didn\u2019t give them any face. \u201cI haven\u2019t even entered your Wang\u2019s family tree and never met you. But if you want the tea making method, fine\u2026 but first bring 10,000 taels of silver.\u201d Wang Dafu and Chen Xiang\u2019s faces were no longer dark, but green as Shao Yunan coldly snorted. \u201cPatriarch Wang only has that other family in his heart, but Zhao Lizheng helped us a lot. I, Shao Yunan, will not be unjust, but I will also not try to win the favor of a person who ignores me. I know exactly who is treating our family like this, so I will give the method to whom I like and I will sell it to whom I want to sell it to. If you want to make friends with me, let\u2019s see if you have such a big heart first.\u201dWang Dafu became angry. \u201cShijing, how does your wife talk? You are the head of the family, so shouldn\u2019t you control your wife? How can you call me cousin, acting like this! Do you no longer want your clan, in the way you no longer want your parents?\u201d Shao Yunan stopped him by saying, \u201cSuch a shameless clan, I don\u2019t want it.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d\u201cShijing! Say something!\u201d Wang Chenxiang was also furious. Wang Shijing said, \u201cThe method belongs to Yunan and in our family Shao Yunan is in charge. I listen to him.\u201d At this moment, Wang Shijing\u2019s behavior was definitely the same as Wang Dali\u2019s. Wang Dafu and Wang Chenxiang become angrier, while Shao Yunan just said with a smile, \u201cShijing is my husband, so it\u2019s only right that I am in charge of the family.\u201d Wang Dafu was so angry that his mouth trembled. \u201d Shijing, is that what you mean?\u201d Shao Yunan become even more determined. \u201cThen I would like to go to patriarch Wang to judge. The tea making method for a piece of meat and a bag of rice, let\u2019s see if the patriarch supports you or us. If the patriarch supports you, I would have nothing more to say to your Wang clan.\u201d Wang Dafu immediately said guiltily, \u201cWe also said we would pay money to buy it.\u201d Shao Yunan\u2026 \u201cI also said 10,000 taels, ah.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The couple finally left in anger. They left and then Shao Yunan left after them, not letting Wang Shijing follow him. What he wanted to do next, it would be best if Wang Shijing was not present. Wang Shijing watched him go towards the Wang patriarch\u2019s house, but just went back to the kitchen to clean up. They had just finished eating and hadn\u2019t washed the dishes yet. He never lets Shao Yunan clean the dishes.When he came to the door of Wang Wenhe\u2019s house, Shao Yunan didn\u2019t go in and just shouted from outside. \u201cIs Patriarch Wang home? It\u2019s Shao Yunan. I\u2019m here to see the patriarch.\u201d Since he did not enter the Wang family tree, Wang Wenhe was not his patriarch, but he was still the only patriarch of the \u2018Wang\u2019 clan. Wang Wenhe, who was in the house, hearing Shao Yunan\u2019s voice felt his body immediately tremble. Wang Shuping hurriedly left the room and opened the door. \u201cYunan, what\u2019s the matter? Come in and speak. \u201cShao Yunan was very polite to Wang Shuping as he spoke. \u201cBrother Shuping, I won\u2019t go in. I came to the patriarch for a judgment, so that people won\u2019t think that I am being unreasonable. Since people try to force me with friendship and family ties, I have no choice but to come to patriarch Wang.\u201d It was just after the farming season, so everyone was at home. Hearing the commotion outside, all the surrounding families came out to watch the show. Wang Shuping hurriedly lowered his voice. \u201cDid the people from that family come looking for you again?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I have never seen him before, so I came looking for patriarch Wang.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Wang Wenhe came out. Shao Yunan had already stated that he would not enter the house, so he might as well come out himself to save the situation from going out of control. Wang Wenhe\u2019s wife and daughter-in-law also came out. Shao Yunan, with his hands behind his back, righteously said, \u201cPatriarch Wang, today someone brought a bag of rice and a piece of meat to my house, saying that since we are from the same family and clan, they wanted me to teach them the method of making tea. They also said that the jam method I sold to Zhao Lizheng should have been \u2018given\u2019 to you, patriarch Wang. I\u2019m here to ask if all the clansmen of the Wang clan think so? Does patriarch Wang and the clan elders also think so? Is it true that whatever ways I think of to make money in the future must be given by me to the Wang clan members without compensation, otherwise it would be ignoring clan affection?Wang Wenhe\u2019s expression changed. Wang Shuping\u2019s expression also changed, while Wang Qian just scolded. \u201cWhat kind of shameless thing spills dirty water on our family?\u201d Aunt Wang then stood up and said, \u201cYunan, who went to your house?\u201d Shao Yunan said loudly, \u201cI don\u2019t know. When he came, he said that he was Shijing\u2019s cousin. He said they were from the same clan and wanted the tea making method. Patriarch Wang, in our family of four, only Wang Shijing\u2019s name is in the family tree, while I, Shao Yunan, is not a part of the Wang clan. It\u2019s also not like the Wang clan members never showed any kindness to our family. Shijing and I will always remember it and repay each person. But some people shouldn\u2019t use this so-called friendship and clan love as a bargaining tool.\u201cOther than that, when we spoke to Wang Qing and Nizi about entering the clan genealogy, the two children cried and said they were unwilling to do so because they never felt that the Wang clan gave them any protection. The two children also said that they were either beaten or scolded for as long as they could remember. Before the adults of the family even got up, the two children had to get up to feed pigs, chickens, cook, and do the laundry.\u201d\u201cWhile Nizi was only two or three years old she already had to wash her Aunt\u2019s clothes. When Wang Zaizheng was studying, Wang Qing had to cook for the family and wash the male family members\u2019 clothes. When he accidentally touched his uncle\u2019s books, he was punished with kneeling all night. Their grandmother and aunt even said in front of them that when Nizi grew up they would sell her to big family as a concubine to earn money, and if Shijing died, they would let Wang Qing take over serving in the army, so that they could not only save silver, but also not waste food on him. This is the impression that the two children have of their relatives and of their clan!\u201dThere was sighing all around and fourth Aunt Wang directly shouted, \u201cIs Wang Dali\u2019s family crazy?!\u201d Wang Wenhe and several clan elders trembled, but it was still a personal family matter. How could such a thing be said aloud? They couldn\u2019t even think of it. Shao Yunan did not intend to give any face to some people, so he directly said, \u201cFor Shijing, it goes without saying, as we all know. When I got married, some people never came to the door, let alone help. But knowing that I found a way to make money, they directly came to our door to ask for it, taking it for granted. Not to mention that Wang Qing and Nizi are not willing to be included in the family tree, I, Shao Yunan, am not willing either! Wang patriarch, Shijing and I don\u2019t dare to ask you for anything more, but I still need to ask you to discipline the clan and not always find trouble with my family. If you are still human, don\u2019t force me anymore. If you force me to death, no one will be happy! If you want the tea making method, fine! Give me 10,000 taels! Otherwise don\u2019t even think of it!\u201dLeaving behind the fierce words and not giving Wang Wenhe a chance to open his mouth, Shao Yunan turned and left. His fierce look made everyone around him not dare to even try to stop him. Wang Wenhe was also furious. Even with all kinds of talk going around, he really didn\u2019t expect that old lady Wang would really treat her eldest son\u2019s family like this. It was no wonder that Shao Yunan would go to the county school. Family or not, they simply gave him no way to live.\u201cPatriarch, this matter absolutely cannot be tolerated. It really gives us no face!\u201d Old father Wang, who had just returned from the construction site, was very angry. \u201cWho in the clan would dare to have a way to earn money in the future? If anyone has one, wouldn\u2019t it be all for nothing? The method of making jam was figured out by Yunan himself. Others don\u2019t have the ability to do it, so they blame Shao Yunan and others? Which clan patriarch set this clan rule? That if the clan members have a way to earn money, it must be gifted to the clan? Look at what happened in our clan! It\u2019s a disgrace!\u201dOld father Wang was Wang Wenhe\u2019s elder. Although he was not a clan elder, he still had a lot of prestige in the Wang clan. Old father Wang was also aware of the fact that Shao Yunan had given Uncle Wang a way to make money. Wang Shijing asked him to supervise the construction work because he was too old to work in the fields, so he took special care of him. Shao Yunan\u2019s words made his face burn as a member of the clan and he was even angrier with the shameless people who went to Shao Yunan\u2019s house for the tea making method. When Zhao Lizheng got the news he rushed over. Although he didn\u2019t hear everything from the start, he still understood what was going on. He spoke out with a cold face. \u201cZhao clan members who do such a thing would be expelled from the clan!\u201dWith just this sentence, Zhao Lizheng stabbed Wang Wenhe directly in the heart. Then leaving with his son, the other onlookers of the Zhao clan also immediately dispersed. Patriarch Sun, who was also present, also followed with a stab. \u201cThe Sun clan should also listen carefully. Those who do such things will be expelled from the clan.\u201d Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family had already received tangible benefits, and Shao Yunan said that he would not interfere with what Zhao Lizheng would do with this method. Zhao Lizheng was already planning to use this method to help the clan. The Sun patriarch was Sun Erjiang\u2019s cousin, a true family member. Patriarch Sun was relatively impartial and his relationship with Zhao Lizheng was good, so he could see very clearly that being friends with Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan will definitely not harm the Sun clan. Which farmer could easily get the jade plate of the magistrate? This alone was enough to arouse his attention towards Shao Yunan.After inserting a knife, the Sun clan patriarch also let his clan members disperse and then left. Wang Wenhe, supported by Wang Shuping, was shaking with anger as he asked, \u201cWho went to Shijing\u2019s house?!\u201d Someone muttered in a low voice, \u201cI think I saw Dafu go to the Shijing\u2019s house with his wife.\u201d Then someone else answered, \u201cI saw it too. It looked like they were carrying meat.\u201d Fourth Aunt Wang immediately sneered, \u201cI told you so, it turned out that that family is also shameless. Patriarch, we Wang clan are really capable people. Shao Yunan and Shijing already told me that they would think of some way to help the clan after the busy farming season is over, but then someone shamelessly went to their door\u2026 What did the Dafu family do when Shijing came back from outside? Did they give him food or even a bag of rice? Our family never asked Shijing and Yunan about the tea making method, so from where did they get the face to do that?\u201dAs soon as fourth Aunt Wang finished, someone immediately asked, \u201cFourth Aunt, Yunan and Shijing really said they would help the clan?\u201d Fourth Uncle Wang just shot back, \u201cYunan already said that he would repay any kindness shown to him. He knows how to be grateful.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Many people became silent, while the families who had helped Wang Shijing during the most difficult time when Wang Shijing came back were happy. Several families that already received inside information already unconsciously raised their chin. Wang Wenhe was so angry that he trembled and roared, \u201cGo, go and call Dafu and his wife over!\u201d Today, it was not only the members of the Wang clan who were humiliated, but even a patriarch like him! What did they mean that the jam should be given to him?!Someone went to call Wang Dafu over, while Wang Dafu\u2019s father, Wang Benchang who was in the crowd and was very ashamed still said, \u201cDafu is not wrong either. If it weren\u2019t for the help of the clan how could Shijing separate from his family? He also wasn\u2019t the one who should marry Shao Yunan. If Wang Zhisong didn\u2019t withdraw from this marriage, wouldn\u2019t Shao Yunan be someone else\u2019s wife?\u201dFather Wang opened his mouth and spat out, \u201cSo it\u2019s all right for your family to go to Yunan to ask for the tea making method? And it\u2019s all right to ask Yunan to give the jam recipe to the patriarch? Is it also alright to throw dirty water on the patriarch?! If I didn\u2019t know better, I would have thought that it was the patriarch who asked Wang Dafu to ask for the jam recipe for him!\u201dWang Wenhe\u2019s face became even darker\u00a0 and Wang Qian cursed. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t know that your family is the closest to old lady Wang\u2019s family?! If you want the recipe for jam, there is no need to throw dirty water on our family!! Why do these shameless people like to stick together so much? You shameless people are the reason why our Wang family has no peace!\u201d\u201cMother.\u201d Wang Shuping stopped his mother and asked his wife to help her go back inside the house. Wang Benchang was younger than Old Father Wang and had little prestige within the clan, but all his family members were fond of taking advantage of others. When Wang Dafu and Chenxiang went to Shao Yunan\u2019s house to ask for the tea making method, Wang Benchang also knew and supported it. Unfortunately, they all underestimated Shao Yunan\u2019s combat effectiveness. To a modern man, a family like Wang Benchang\u2019s was just a farce. How could this type of people have anything to do with him?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As soon as she arrived, Wang You began to cry, \u201cPatriarch, how can you still care about Wang Shijing\u2019s family? His cousin and sister-in-law went to their door, but they were kicked out. They don\u2019t think of themselves as a member of the Wang clan at all!\u201d Is that what was meant by saying, villain complains first? Wang Wenhe was so angry that he pointed at Wang You as he said while trembling with anger, \u201cYou still have the nerve to complain to me?! Ask what your son and daughter-in-law have done! The face of our Wang clan has been completely disgraced by them! Open the ancestral temple!\u201dWang You froze and immediately panicked. But Wang Chenxiang went to her mother-in-law\u2019s side and said without fear, \u201cPatriarch, you are being unjust. Dafu and I also said we could buy it for money, but Shao Yunan acted too deceitfully and asked for 10,000 taels, which is clearly saying that he doesn\u2019t want to sell it. He also would rather sell the money-making recipe to Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family than to the clan. Was what I and Dafu said wrong? Dafu and I also wanted to buy a money-making recipe for our clan. Where is the shame? Almost all the members of Aunt (old lady) Wang\u2019s family went to jail, but you didn\u2019t say that they disgraced our clan. But now you want to open the ancestral hall for the sake of the clan.\u201d\u201cYou, you\u2026\u201d Wang Wenhe was so angry that his body was trembling and his face was white, but he could not refute Wang Chenxiang\u2019s words. Wang Benchang also added, \u201cPatriarch, what my family Dafu did was all for the sake of the clan. Wang Dali\u2019s family caused such a big trouble. Wang Tianyan and his wife were even arrested, while Wang Zhisong was disgraced in front of the county magistrate, but why didn\u2019t you open the ancestral hall then? My family just wanted the tea making method for the sake of the whole clan, but you now want to open the ancestral hall? Are you not afraid of chilling the hearts of the clan members? You gave three taels of silver to Wang Dali\u2019s family to hire people to work on their land, so why don\u2019t you also give us three taels of silver to hire people to work for us? Just because the other family has a child student and mine don\u2019t? You are so biased. We will not go to the ancestral hall.\u201d After saying that, Wang Benchang said to his family, \u201cGo home! No good deed goes unpunished, go!\u201dWang Benchang ignored Wang Wenhe and left with his family. Even the clan elders who wanted to punish them could no longer speak. In dealing with old lady Wang\u2019s family, they were indeed biased in every way. The clan members of the Wang clan who stayed behind looked at each other. Wang Benchang\u2019s words were infuriating, but they could not refute them. The fact was that the patriarch was indeed very partial to old lady Wang\u2019s family, because their family had a child student.Old Father Wang let out a long sigh and looked at the faltering Wang Wenhe, and said, \u201cPatriarch, don\u2019t let the clan stray from their hearts.\u201d After saying this in a serious way, Old Father Wang took his own family members away as well. The three clan elders gestured and let everyone disperse before one of them said, \u201cWang Shuping, help your father in.\u201d The very stifled Wang Shuping helped his father, who looked like he could collapse at any moment, into the house. The three clan elders followed them in and after a short while, Wang Qian\u2019s howls came from inside the house. Wang Qian\u2019s anger was so great, that she wanted to bump her head into the wall till she died.The three clan elders asked Wang Shuping to go to Wang Shijing\u2019s house. Shao Yunan \u2018made friends\u2019 with the county magistrate and the Wang family had lost face in front of the county magistrate. If Shao Yunan mentioned a few words to the county magistrate, due to the seriousness of the matter, their Wang clan would not be able to stand in the future. Wang Zhisong\u2019s future would also be affected.As soon as old lady Wang and her family heard that Shao Yunan had gone to the patriarch\u2019s house, they felt so guilty that they all hid in the house and did not go out. But their neighbors were kind enough to come to their door and tell them what had happened. Originally, old lady Wang was quite happy to hear that Wang Dafu went to their door to ask about the tea making method, but when she heard the end result that Wang Chenxiang had said that the patriarch should punish their family first, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t accept it, old lady Wang become very angry.Gossip was often biased. Although the meaning of the words was similar, if you changed the original words even a little, the listeners would have a different understanding. Old lady Wang thought to herself, \u2018What\u2019s the point of bringing my family into your family\u2019s business? And they even dare to mention Wang Zhisong.\u2019 She coveted the jam recipe, but she didn\u2019t ask Wang Dafu to ask for it! Old lady Wang immediately dragged Wang Chunxiu to Wang Dafu\u2019s house. In the past, when old lady Wang went out to make trouble, she was followed by Wang Guo. But now that she was in jail, old lady Wang had to drag Wang Chunxiu along, since she did not want to be too disadvantaged by going alone.Not to mention that old lady Wang and Wang Dafu\u2019s family quarreled, the Zhao and Sun clan members also saw a joke of the Wang clan. But the most\u00a0 important thing was that Shao Yunan, who was really capable, had not yet been included in the Wang family tree, so he simply did not recognize himself as a member of the Wang family. There were also people who said that the Wang family deserved it. Wang Qing was already six years old and has not yet been included in the clan genealogy, but Wang Wenhe, the clan patriarch, has only Wang Zhisong on his mind. Wang Zhisong has not yet brought any benefit to him, but he has already separated people from the clan. Although Wang Chenxiang and Wang Benchang are suspected of reversing right and wrong, it wasn\u2019t that much different, since they expressed the dissatisfaction in the hearts of many clan members.When Wang Shuping came over, Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing were as enthusiastic as ever, making Wang Shuping both embarrassed and depressed. Shao Yunan took out a cup of chrysanthemum tea and served it to Wang Shuping. Wang Shuping looked at the yellow chrysanthemums in the white porcelain cup and looked up in amazement. Wang Shijing said, \u201cThis is the chrysanthemum tea made by Yunan. It has just been made.\u201d Shao Yunan said, \u201cIt tastes a little bitter, but try it brother Shuping.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Amazement immediately appeared in his eyes. The taste was a little bitter, but it was also very peculiar. He took another sip, swallowed it,and carefully recalled it before he said, \u201cAt first it was a little bitter, but after drinking more, it became a little sweet.\u201d Taking another sip, he nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d Shao Yunan said, \u201cThis was made with the wild chrysanthemums picked from the mountain. But since Shijing and I don\u2019t have energy to gather them and everyone is busy with farming, we didn\u2019t get much. It has good cooling properties, so I made some for Shijing and the children to drink. This wild chrysanthemum tea is also good for colds and if you put in a few pieces of licorice, it would taste even better. I will ask Shijing to pack some for you later.\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u201d How could Wang Shuping ask for it? This chrysanthemum tea has never been seen by him before, so it must be one way Shao Yunan thought of to make money. Shao Yunan looked at Wang Shijing, making him get up and leave. The chrysanthemum tea was stored in Wang Qing and Nizi\u2019s room. Then Shao Yunan said, \u201cBrother Shuping, don\u2019t blame me for what happened just now. Shijing is a member of the Wang clan, so he cannot express his many grievances. Today, someone asked for my tea making method for a piece of meat and a bag of rice, so tomorrow even more people would come to ask for it for free. I\u2019m not boasting. No one in the world knows my recipes but me. Even if I am no longer short of money, I\u2019m not that generous. Not to mention that my family has many places that I need to spend money on. If they want my life-hood craft, I need to find the clan patriarch, otherwise anyone could use family kinship to pressure our family.\u201dWang Shuping sighed. \u201cWang Dafu\u2019s family really likes to take advantage of others. Yunan, my father and I really haven\u2019t asked for the jam recipe.\u201d Shao Yunan said, \u201cI believe that. But my words are not nonsense either. That couple did accuse me of \u2018why I sold the recipe to Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family, instead of giving it to the patriarch\u2019.\u201d Wang Shuping was so angry that the veins on his forehead were about to come out. Shao Yunan said, \u201cBrother Shuping, don\u2019t blame me for speaking harshly. But why did Wang Dafu and the others dare to say such things? If the patriarch\u2019s prestige in the clan was enough, would this family dare to throw dirty water on the patriarch? I was also told about it later. In the end, the patriarch siding with old lady Wang\u2019s family made the clan unafraid of him. Brother Shuping, let me ask you. If Wang Zhisong fails the examination, will the patriarch be able to bear the consequences of his favoritism all this time?\u201dWang Shuping did not say anything but he frowned as Shao Yunan continued. \u201cI was initially prepared to use the jam recipe to earn money, but after I discussed it with Shijing, I decided to sell it. Because if it was left in our hands, we simply wouldn\u2019t be able to protect it.\u201d Wang Shuping raised his eyes, as Shao Yunan said very directly, \u201cHow can making money with jam bring me trouble from the clan? Can I only mean from old lady Wang\u2019s family? Or someone from the clan that would come and make trouble if I made money? How would the patriarch judge at that time? The money earned in our family by selling stones already caused a lot of jealousy. If I hadn\u2019t gone to the county school to reason with the teachers, my family\u2019s money from the sale of the stones and the remaining stones would not be kept.\u201d Wang Shuping\u2019s face was burning. The patriarch was his father after all.Wang Shuping could not answer, so Shao Yunan continued. \u201cFor the sake of Shijing and my peace in the future and so that we can earn money later, I sold the jam recipe. However, Shijing\u2019s last name is still Wang, so I could only sell it to Zhao Lizheng, because only Zhao Lizheng can keep our family\u2019s peace. If I handed it over to the clan patriarch he might have taken it to that family to \u2018please\u2019 Wang Zhisong. Even if it\u2019s given to you, you can\u2019t protect it.\u201d Wang Shuping felt even more ashamed.\u201cBrother Shuping, if it was not a last resort, Shijing would not have left the clan. But today\u2019s clan is not only not a refuge for us, but something that can be used to harm us. Shijing and I want to live well and we want our two children to be safe from the clan. We have to find someone who can protect us. The clan couldn\u2019t protect us, so we had to find Zhao Lizheng. This house is also a protection talisman for me, Shijing, Wang Qing, and Nizi.\u201d Shao Yunan helplessly said, \u201cI was going to sell this chrysanthemum tea recipe to fourth Uncle and fourth Aunt Wang. But with Wang Dafu acting this way and the fact that the patriarch can do nothing with people like them, I hesitate. I don\u2019t want fourth Uncle and fourth Aunt to suffer a disaster, instead of earning money.\u201dWang Shuping was very surprised as he asked, \u201cYou are going to sell this too? This chrysanthemum tea may be even more profitable than that jam. Yunan, I will advise my father. Aren\u2019t you and Shijing still in contact with the county magistrate? If you sell it, how much would you sell it for? People who wouldn\u2019t be able to buy it would still gossip about you at that time, making the matter only worse.\u201dShao Yunan smiled. \u201cI can take care of everyone, but I must repay those who are kind to my family. Brother Shuping, seriously. If I were not afraid that the patriarch would take my recipe to that family, I would really want to give you this recipe for chrysanthemum tea. Shijing and I both know that you are looking out for us. Please don\u2019t think I am small minded, but there is just no way that our family and that family would ever reconcile. Even if my recipe was burned, I won\u2019t let them get even a little bit of advantage.\u201dWang Shuping\u2019s mood went up and down as Shao Yunan spoke. \u201cBrother Shuping, even if the patriarch won\u2019t reveal the recipe to the other family. I\u2019m worried that all the money you\u2019ve worked so hard to earn will be used to subsidize it. Even if you don\u2019t care, it\u2019s impossible for your wife to endure it all the time. You\u2019d better persuade the patriarch to not just focus on Wang Zhisong\u2019s reputation. The family is not known for showing gratitude. Even if Wang Zhisong can achieve the prime minister status, what would he give to the Wang clan and the patriarch? I\u2019m not asking the patriarch to ignore them, I just want the patriarch to be fair and just.\u201dWang Shijing came in with a paper bag in his hands. He came over and put the paper bag in front of Wang Shuping who could immediately smell the smell of chrysanthemums. \u201cBrother Shuping, take it back and soak it in hot water for a moment before drinking.\u201d\u201cNo, I will come back another day.\u201d Wang Shuping refused to take it, so Shao Yunan took it and stuffed it into his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s not for you to drink. This stuff clears the liver and brightens the eyes and helps with curing the cold and sore throat, so it\u2019s most suitable for Brother Yan to drink. I heard that he studies very hard.\u201d Wang Shuping pursed his lips and finally took it. \u201cThen I won\u2019t be polite with you.\u201d After a pause, he said, \u201cYou should make this stuff yourselves and sell it for money. I\u2019ve never even seen this, even at doctor Sun\u2019s place. Doctor Sun also knows the owner of the pharmacy in the county town, so this tea can be sold to the pharmacy to make money.\u201dShao Yunan thought that Wang Shuping and Wang Wenhe really didn\u2019t behave like father and son. Just look how reasonable Wang Shuping was. Shao Yunan laughed. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll discuss it with Shujing. But if there are more clan members coming to me asking for the recipe what should I do? I can\u2019t go to the patriarch every time.\u201d Wang Shuping\u2019s expression immediately became cold. \u201cJust directly point them to me. Most people who resist are still reasonable and for those who are too unreasonable, there is no need to give them face. I will persuade my father. The three clan elders also understand in their hearts how to choose or else in the future, anyone who has a craft that can earn money would go missing.\u201d\u201cThis is all I have to say.\u201d Shao Yunan felt that Wang Shuping was more suitable to be the patriarch. Wang Shuping took a packet of the wild chrysanthemum flowers and left, while Shao Yunan turned around and smiled greatly at Wang Shijing. \u201dThe patriarch will probably become so angry that he will vomit blood.\u201d Wang Shijing took him into his arms. \u201cIf the patriarch is still bent on having his own way, the clan will only become more and more distant from him, and sooner or later something will happen. The good thing is that Wang Shuping is very sensible.\u201d Shao Yunan breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cHa, now that the Sun and Zhao clans are on our side, we will have no worries about doing business in the future.\u201d After saying that, Shao Yunan suddenly exclaimed, \u201cI forgot about something very important!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d Wang Shijing was so startled that he hugged his wife with both hands. \u201cThe matter of buying the grape seeds!\u201d Shao Yunan slapped his head hard, breaking away from Wang Shijing\u2019s embrace. He was about to rush into the other room to write the letter. He had been so busy that he had forgotten such an important matter! Wang Shijing caught up with him and grabbed him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, wife. I asked Brother Yuande to write it for me a long time ago. It was already delivered to trusted letter runners to be sent out.\u201d\u201cAh? When?\u201d\u201cBefore the farming season. I asked him to help me write a letter when Brother Yuande went to the county town to deliver the jam. I also didn\u2019t ask only for grape seeds, but said I wanted to get as many types of seeds as they could get of rare fruits from there. If they had any tea tree seeds, I also asked them to get them for me. There is a kind of melon over there called red melon, with red flesh that is really good to eat in summer. It\u2019s sweet and juicy, so you will really like it. There is also another kind of melon with yellow skin and many gold lines on the skin, called golden thread melon. It\u2019s also particularly sweet. If we can also grow it, we can see if it can also be made into a jam.\u201dWasn\u2019t that watermelon and melon? Shao Yunan jumped onto Wang Shijing and climbed up on him on all fours. \u201cShijing you are so powerful!\u201d Then he gave him a big kiss on the cheek. Wang Shijing doesn\u2019t understand what he meant, but it was certainly a good thing. He was also very happy that he made his wife happy. Then he carried him into their room and put him on the bed. \u201cI\u2019m going to boil water, want to take a bath?\u201d\u201cNo, just wipe it. How long will it take for the letter to reach your comrade-in-arms?\u201d\u201cThey are brothers who fought with me in the war.\u201d Comrade-in-arms\u2026\u00a0 It sounded really appropriate. Wang Shijing\u2026 \u201cIt depends on how long it takes the merchant to get there, it will take a month at the earliest.\u201d\u201cOh, isn\u2019t it at least two months before I get a reply?\u201d The ancient times without express delivery was really too inconvenient! \u201cThere is no hurry. If I didn\u2019t need to keep an eye on the fields and the new house, I\u2019d go pick wild chrysanthemums for you. This chrysanthemum tea is really delicious, you should make more of it.\u201d\u201cYou like it?\u201d\u201c\u2026 it has a cooling effect and is good for sore throats, drinking more of it would be good.\u201d\u201c\u2026 You coquettish old man!\u201d\u201cCoquettish? What do you mean?\u201dWas he old? Wang Shijing touched his temples as Shao Yunan dragged him into the bed. \u201cA guy who looks honest like you, but is actually a pervert. That\u2019s what coquettish means!\u201d\u201cYou are my wife.\u201d Wang Shijing did not consider himself a pervert. Shouldn\u2019t he be flirtatious with his own wife? Fortunately in the next room, their words could not be heard as Wang Nazi very seriously said, \u201cBrother, I will be as good as my little father in the future.\u201d Wang Qing touched his sister\u2019s head. \u201cWell, brother also wants to be like little father.\u201d Shao Yunan did not yet know that he had become the idol of the two children. At this time, he was being gnawed on by a certain someone.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wang Wenhe was lying on the bed while Wang Qian and Wang Yan were sitting at his bedside. Wang Wenhe was pale and obviously angry. Wang Shuping\u2019s wife Wang Shen carried a bowl of medicine to the room, making Wang Shuping frightened. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with father?\u201d Wang Shen whispered, \u201cFather\u2019s heart is not well. I just asked Grandpa Sun to come and check him, saying that father is very angry. Old Aunt Wang went to Wang Dafu\u2019s house to make trouble and later she came to father to make a decision for her. But she was kicked out by mother.\u201dWang Shuping coldly said: \u201cWhat did she want to do this time? They take part in every trouble.\u201d When she saw that her son had come back, Wang Qian burst into tears and said to Wang Wenhe who still didn\u2019t say a word, \u201cI told you that you can\u2019t count on that family, but you didn\u2019t listen. Now, people in the clan can throw dirty water on our family at will and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. Are you still the patriarch or not?\u201d Wang Shuping took the medicine bowl from his wife and went to the bed. \u201cMother, don\u2019t say anything else. Father is not feeling well. Father, drink the medicine. Yan help grandpa up.\u201d Wang Yan helped his grandpa sit up, while Wang Shuping fed his father the medicine. After drinking the medicine, Wang Wenhe coughed a few times, his whole person looking very dispirited.Wang Shuping handed the empty bowl to his wife and rubbed his father\u2019s chest. Without avoiding letting his son and wife hear it he said, \u201cYan, there is a packet in father\u2019s sleeve, take it out.\u201d Wang Yan obediently took out a paper bag from his father\u2019s sleeve and smelled a medicinal scent. Wang Qian wiped her tears. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Wang Shen also asked curiously. Without explaining it Wang Shuping just said, \u201cYan, open it.\u201d Wang Yan put the paper bag on the bed and opened it. When he saw the golden yellow and beautiful wild chrysanthemums inside, everyone else froze and even Wang Yan looked up. \u201cFather, are they chrysanthemums?\u201dWang Shuping still did not explain as he just said, \u201cCount eight flowers and prepare with your mother four cups of water, use boiled water to brew it.\u201d Wang Yan was full of doubts, but he counted to eight and got off the bed, going to the kitchen with his mother. Wang Qian asked, \u201cDid Shijing give this to you?\u201d Wang Wenhe\u2019s hand moved, but Wang Shuping just continued to rub his father\u2019s heart and said, \u201cIt\u2019s made by Yunan. Mother, take a look.\u201d Wang Qian picked up one and said in surprise, \u201cIt\u2019s dry. Is this dried chrysanthemums?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d Wang Qian smelled it again. It was very fragrant and she said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t smell like direct sun-drying, sun-drying would leave a moldy smell.\u201d Wang Shuping sighed. \u201cShijing\u2019s wife really has a good brain. If it wasn\u2019t for father always favoring that family, how could Shijing and his family be so distant from father and our family? Didn\u2019t they sell the jam recipe to the Zhao family because father always favors that family?\u201d Wang Shuping advised, \u201cMother, father is also acting for the sake of our family so don\u2019t be angry. Every time I go over, Shijing and Yunan are always polite. This chrysanthemum tea, Shao Yunan, also insisted on giving it to me, saying that it is for Wang Yan to drink.\u201d\u201cAh? Why is it for Wang Yan?\u201d Wang Shuping smiled but didn\u2019t explain. Then Wang Shan and Wang Yan came back. Wang Yan showed a surprised expression, but Wang Shan\u2019s expression was also full of novelty. She put the tray on the edge of the bed. On the tray there were four cups of water and in each cup were two large, bright yellow chrysanthemums. The wild chrysanthemums on the mountains near Xiushui Village were big, so that just two of them could make a cup of tea that had a taste of bitterness mixed with sweetness. Because Shao Yunan used spiritual spring water when he was preparing it, it also had some different aromas.\u201cFather, is this chrysanthemum? Can you drink it in water?\u201d Obviously Wang Yan had already tasted it, since he already picked up his own cup. Wang Shuping continued, \u201cFather, mother, this chrysanthemum brewed water is very peculiar, try it.\u201d Wang Qian looked at her daughter-in-law and grandson and picked up a cup, while Wang Shuping picked up another cup, blew on it and fed it to his father. \u201cFather, please also try it. This chrysanthemum drink has a cooling effect and can help heal colds. You have been very busy lately, so you should try It.\u201dThis time, Wang Wenhe did not refuse and just opened his mouth and took a sip. The drink was still a little hot, so he didn\u2019t drank too much, but he could still taste that the water carried a peculiar taste he had never tasted before. It was both bitter and sweet at the same time. Wang Shuping then explained, \u201cYunan said that this chrysanthemum tea is good for the liver and eyes, and can help with healing a cold and sore throat. It is also the same as tea and can be brewed at any time to drink, so he prepared this bag for Wang Yan to drink. But I think it would also be good for you to drink. Father, you should not blame Shijing and Yunan. It is thanks to Shao Yunan coming to us today that we learned that someone is fooling others under our name.\u201dWang Shao hurriedly whispered to her mother-in-law to persuade her to let her husband continue to talk. Wang Shuping fed his father a sip of chrysanthemum tea again and said, \u201cFather, it is also because of things like this that Shao Yunan and Shijing are afraid that someone would come and make trouble, especially if our family sided with that family. So they could only sell the jam recipe to Zhao Lizheng. Otherwise how could they not take such a profitable deal for themselves. They said that they originally wanted to give it to me, but Shao Yunan asked me that if Wang Zhisong asked you for the jam recipe, would you give it to him or not. But I didn\u2019t know how to answer him. He also asked me if we earned money selling the jam, would we use the money to subsidize that family. Then I also didn\u2019t know how to answer him. I didn\u2019t want to say it, but father you might indeed have done so.\u201dHearing this, Wang Qian covered her chest and said, \u201cYou are an old fool! Giving money earned by our family to that family. We all know that no matter what we give to that family, it will never come back!\u201d Wang Yan hurriedly held his grandmother and interjected. \u201cGrandpa, everyone in our private school knows about little Uncle Wang. There are also people asking me if I know him, saying that we are from Xiushui Village. Fortunately, Zhao Congbo told them that he and I were only members of the same clan and not from the same family, so we are not close. Otherwise I would have been laughed at.\u201dWang Yan had wanted to say this for a long time, but he was afraid of annoying his father and grandfather. \u201cJust look at that!\u201d Wang Qian was so angry that she wanted to slap the old man a few times to wake him up. then she said angrily to Wang Yan, \u201cWhat little Uncle Wang! Call him Wang Zhisong!\u201d Wang Shuping didn\u2019t expect that Wang Zhisong\u2019s story would spread even to the ordinary private school, so he could only imagine how \u2018famous\u2019 Wang Zhisong was in the county school. Wang Shen asked anxiously, \u201cDid Shijing give you this chrysanthemum tea? For our family to make?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When Wang Shen asked this question, Wang Qian also looked at Wang Shuping a little anxiously, so Wang Shuping had no choice but to say, \u201cShijing and Yunan have their own plan. They are worried\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t even have to say what they were worried about. Wang Qian couldn\u2019t help it any longer and hit Wang Wenhe. \u201cAre you still concerned about that family? What else can that family give us except trouble?! What else do you plan to do?\u201dWang Shen, who received a sign from her husband, hurriedly stopped her mother-in-law with an anxious expression on her face. But Wang Wenhe just said, \u201cYou can\u2019t take this recipe.\u201d Wang Qian\u2019s breath almost didn\u2019t come out, her eyes full of tears. Wang Shen was also extraordinarily disappointed and angry, but Wang Wenhe just raised his hand. \u201cListen to me, guys.\u201d After taking a few breaths, he continued, \u201cI am really biased towards Wang Dali\u2019s family and I hope that Wang Zhisong will give our Wang clan a fighting chance to promote our clan in the future. Toward Wang Shijing I really wasn\u2019t fair enough. If we\u2019d really accepted this chrysanthemum tea recipe from them, our family would be even more stabbed in the back in the future. If that happens I don\u2019t know how much dirty water would be poured on us.\u201dWang Qian shed tears, but Wang Shuping said, \u201cFather, your concern is right. When Shijing and Yunan proposed it to me, I also refused. Now that Uncle Zhao opened the path, they can also start a business and earn money without worrying. This chrysanthemum tea might be even more popular than the jam, since it can also cure diseases. It will also earn more, so it won\u2019t be sold for a cheap price.\u201d Wang Shen was also a bit disappointed and her eyes could not help but redden. But Wang Wenhe was happy that his son understood him and patted his son\u2019s hand. \u201cShuping, father made you feel aggrieved. In the future, father might still be confused about some things, but let\u2019s not envy other people\u2019s money and raise your Wang Yan well.\u201d Wang Shuping nodded and Wang Yan swore, \u201cGrandpa, I will study hard.\u201d Wang Wenhe stroked his grandson\u2019s head, his eyes filled with relief.\u203bThe storm passed and the punishment of Wang Dafu\u2019s family also came to nothing. However, many people openly and secretly criticized Wang Dafu\u2019s family, including his father Wang Benchang. If asking for money-making recipes was justified, who with money-making skills would still dare to show them out in the future? That was obviously something to think about. Even if they were from the same clan, the clan rules did not stipulate that crafts had to be shared with the clan free of charge.Naturally, if Wang Dafu\u2019s family could not save face, you didn\u2019t even need to mention that after their big fight with old lady Wang both sides tore their faces and revealed a lot of family private affairs through old lady Wang\u2019s broken mouth. Wang Chenxiang and Wang Guo were usually very close to each other and they would gossip about everything in their families. Wang Guo would then repeat it to old lady Wang. Old lady Wang\u2019s shrewish nature could be considered unique in Xiushui Village, so Wang Dafu\u2019s wife simply could not quarrel with her. But afterwards, Wang Benchang reprimanded his daughter-in-law severely.But no matter how severe the situation was outside, Wang Zhisong was just sitting alone. He lost face in the county school and did not want to listen to the village gossip. He agreed with old lady Wang that after three months he would start living in the county town and old lady Wang would rent him a house. The old woman had saved some money, but if she wanted to rent Wang Zhisong a house in the county town, it would still be a struggle. So on seeing Wang Shijing\u2019s family spend so much money, she not only hated him, but also had some thoughts about it.If their fields could not be planted in time, their next year harvest would be problematic and would earn them less money. Old lady Wang, making up her mind, took the three silver taels given by Wang Wenhe and hired some people. Each person would be paid 12 copper coins, not including food but with boarding in the firewood shed. No one in the village was willing to do it, so old lady Wang went to the county town to hire refugees like Wang Shijing did. Even if there was no food included in such an already small amount of money, there were still a few people willing to do it, since it was difficult to find other jobs. However, the people who took this job were people who were not physically strong, so it was unusually difficult to find any people who worked in teams.When they were hired, Wang Chunxiu stopped working and Wang Zaizheng also hid back at home. Old lady Wang also did not force them anymore. After all, after spending money to hire people, there was certainly no point in letting their own family members work any longer. Old lady Wang hired five people, one of whom was a woman, so Wang Chunxiu asked her to even wash their family\u2019s clothes. The woman refused to do it, saying that she was here to plant the fields, not to wash clothes. It was only twelve copper coins a day, so how could this family act so shameless? But Wang Chunxiu said that she would not get paid unless she washed the clothes. It would be winter soon, so in order to earn some money for the winter, the woman gritted her teeth and endured it.Within two days of their arrival, the five people recognized other refugees who were working in the Wang Shijing\u2019s family fields and were hired just like them. Upon asking, their family also did not cover food and accommodation, but if they finished plowing the fields in 20 days they would earn 60 copper coins a day. They were also already paid a deposit of two taels of silver. They did the same work in the field, but the difference in the pay was just too big! Then, they also heard from the mouth of the \u2018villagers\u2019 that the family they were working for was cruel and even tried to rob their own son of money. The hired help from Wang Shijing\u2019s side, out of the goodness of his heart, reminded them not to finish the job until they were paid money.Now the five people panicked, especially the woman who also had to wash the Wang family\u2019s clothes. The five people together no longer worked and went together to old lady Wang\u2019s house to request a deposit. The woman also asked for extra money for washing their clothing. Then both sides quarreled. Old lady Wang and Wang Chunxiu said that they shouldn\u2019t even think about a deposit and would not be paid until they finish their work. While the other side said that they wouldn\u2019t work until they got the deposit.The quarrel between the two sides naturally attracted a crowd of onlookers. Wang Zhisong knew that his mother wanted to save money to rent him a house in the county town so he didn\u2019t care. In his opinion, they are just homeless people so if someone wanted to hire them they should already be grateful. If his family did not hire them, where would they go to make money? Wang Zhisong felt that he would be safe as long as Shao Yunan didn\u2019t go to the county school to make trouble, and he didn\u2019t provoke him.With this quarrel, the villagers of Xiushui Village refreshed their understanding of old lady Wang\u2019s family. Someone who took short time work in the county town, after being busy for the whole day, would get paid 20 copper coins. But wages would go up during the busy farming period, but these people for a mere 12 copper coins were willing to work from dawn until night without any rest. Could old lady Wang be even more stingy? Then when the woman began to argue, the villagers sighed even more.Her 12 copper coi wage also covered washing the clothes of that entire family. Especially when they heard that woman shouting that Wang Chunxiu made her even wash her pants after her time of the month. The villagers\u2019 uproar, mockery, and disgraceful voice almost drowned Wang Chunxiu. After that, it was spread that Wang Chunxiu used to let Nizi wash her dirty pants, which was brought up a lot by old ladies, daughters-in-laws, and old Aunts who pointed it out. The woman\u2019s dirty pants should be either washed by her own mother, or by herself. They should not be carelessly washed by others or by some ignorant little girls. It was really shameless.When the quarrel became particularly fierce, Wang Shuping came. As soon as he came, everyone quieted down. Although Wang Wenhe\u2019s prestige has declined among the clan, Wang Shuping still enjoyed great prestige among the young people of the clan and even the clan elders were very optimistic about him. It was also most likely that he would be the future clan patriarch. As soon as old lady Wang saw Wang Shuping, she asked him to give her a judgment. However, Wang Shuping only glanced at her lightly and opened his mouth to ask, \u201cIs Wang Zhisong home?\u201d Old lady Wang froze and subconsciously answered, \u201cWang Zhisong is studying inside.\u201d Wang Shuping\u2026 \u201cHow can he study when there is such a mess outside? Call him out.\u201d Old lady Wang was not happy, \u201cWhy should I call him out? He doesn\u2019t understand these things, he just needs to study well.\u201d Wang Shuping didn\u2019t want to argue with old lady Wang anymore, so he just shouted, \u201cWang Zhisong come out.\u201dWang Shuping called him, making Wang Zhisong who was pretending to be deaf and blind in the house not know how to respond. Finally, he had no choice but to come out of the house. Wang Wenhe looked at him and said, \u201cWang Zhisong, your eldest brother is already separated. Your second brother is in prison and your father is old. So now you are the one in charge of the family. But why are you still reading like this inside?\u201d Wang Zhisong frowned slightly as he answered, \u201cMother is the one who makes the decisions about hiring workers. Moreover, the daily wage of twelve copper coins is not a small amount. There are also many refugees in the county town, so if these people don\u2019t want to work, there are other people who would be willing to do it.\u201dThe woman immediately shouted\u201d \u201cTwelve copper coins a day to wash your family\u2019s clothes and your daughter\u2019s dirty pants! No one would be willing to do it!\u201d Wang Chunxiu had long been shamelessly hiding inside the house, but Wang Zhisong\u2019s eyes just fleshed with disgust as he replied, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to do it, don\u2019t do it. Can my sister still force you?\u201d The woman shot back, \u201cIf I don\u2019t wash the clothes, your sister said that I would not be paid! I heard that you are a scholar. Why are you so unreasonable? \u201d Wang Zhisong couldn\u2019t stand to be insulted with his status as a scholar, so he said coldly, \u201cIt\u2019s because you didn\u2019t ask clearly before you agreed to come to work and now you are blaming my sister. Since you washed clothes, naturally you did less work in the fields. You are so picky with work. If you don\u2019t want to work just don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d The woman couldn\u2019t refute Wang Zhisong and just cried. Wang Shuping looked at Wang Zhisong expressionlessly and said, \u201cWang Zhisong, my father gave three taels of silver for Aunt Wang to hire people. There are only five people and each of them is paid only 12 copper coins a day. For five people, it\u2019s 60 copper coins a day. With three taels of silver, you can hire them for 50 days. That is not counting Uncle Wang and that your family has cattle. I would like to ask, who in the village with cattle still needs six people to work for 50 days? Even if there are no cows, 50 days is still more than enough.\u201d As soon as Wang Shuping said this, Wang Zhisong\u2019s expression changed, while old lady Wang felt guilty. The villagers were also surprised as someone asked, \u201cThis is not coveting the patriarch\u2019s money, right?!\u201d\u201cOld Aunt Wang, you are too good at calculating. The patriarch gave three taels of silver to help your family hire people, but now you even want to get a share for yourself. You are also counting your family\u2019s wages, right?\u201d Wang Zhisong was instantly embarrassed. Wang Shuping was right in front of him and the old woman, who was already doing a bad job, dared to spill out even more and stammered. \u201cThey are willing to work for 12 copper coins a day, so why should I take the initiative to increase their wages?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one who said you could only pay 12 copper coins a day! Not a coin more! We also have to pay for our meals!\u201d The five workers immediately shouted, \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for the coming winter, who would want to work for you!\u201d Old lady Wang immediately said, \u201cBut you were still willing to earn it!\u201d\u201cThis old woman is too unreasonable!\u201d Wang Shuping asked the five workers aloud, \u201cFor how many days have you been hired?\u201d\u201cFifteen days.\u201d\u201cWow!\u201d Immediately, some people said, \u201cFifteen days is only 900 copper coins so old lady Wang wanted to keep more than 2 taels of silver for herself.\u201d Old lady Wang\u2019s face could no longer be held up and even Wang Zhisong was not able to help her. Then the hired woman shouted again, \u201cThey say that people who study are reasonable, but how can you be so black-hearted?\u201d Wang Shuping reached out directly to old lady Wang. \u201cAunt Wang, 900 copper coins is not much, Aunt should not be short of it. My father is sick and needs to see a doctor and take medicine, so since you can bear the cost of hiring others, give me back the three taels of silver.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Return the silver?! Wang Zhisong answered for her, \u201cMother, give the silver back to the patriarch.\u201d He refused to speak directly to Wang Shuping. Old lady Wang anxiously said, \u201cThe money given can still be taken back? But mother saved it for you to use?!\u201d Wow! The surrounding area exploded. This old woman Wang really wanted to steal the clan patriarch\u2019s money! Wang Shuping\u2019s voice became colder, \u201cAunt Wang. No one\u2019s silver falls from the sky. You went to my house and cried, saying that there was no one at your house to work in the fields and my father was kind and took three taels of silver to help your family, but you wanted to leave it for your own use. Auntie Wang, Wang Zhisong is a scholar so let\u2019s not make a mess. Auntie you must definitely have more than 900 copper coins so give me back all three taels of silver.\u201dThe villagers all spoke out one after another, saying bluntly that old lady Wang was unethical and some people even said that Wang Zhisong as a scholar, how could he ignore the matter of the patriarch\u2019s silver, and if he knew the difference between this and cheating money. Wang Zhisong\u2019s face was so dark that it could not become darker, but old lady Wang still wanted to argue. Wang Zhisong forced old lady Wang to return the three taels of silver to Wang Shuping and that wasn\u2019t all. When the old woman reluctantly returned the silver to Wang Shuping, the five people she hired also started to ask for the money for the days they had already worked, then they would quit.How could old lady Wang be willing to give it? The farm work was still not finished, but the villagers\u2019 words were already full of disdain and ridicule. Wang Zhisong with his head down, forced old lady Wang to settle the five people\u2019s wages. Once the money was settled, Wang Shuping turned around and hired the five people to help with his family\u2019s farm. Wang Wenhe was furious, but Wang Shuping did not allow his father to work in the field. He was the only son and his family has both old and young. His mother and wife also could not do much. Anyway, these three taels of silver was originally given to old lady Wang to hire people. Wang Shuping was simply extravagant for once, so that both his parents could relax.Wang Shuping did not give a wage as high as Wang Shijing. He only paid 30 copper coins per person a day, but with food and accommodation, and they must finish the work in the fields within 15 days. He also paid a deposit of 300 copper coins in advance to them, making all five agree immediately. Wang Shijing gave a high wage, but didn\u2019t include food and accommodation. Besides, their abilities were also not as good as those hired by Wang Shijing, so they had nothing more to say. When Wang Shuping took the workers away, old lady Wang sat down on the ground and howled until Wang Zhisong grabbed her and dragged her back into the house. Once they were back inside and they saw Wang Chunxiu, old lady Wang began to scold Wang Chunxiu about forcing that woman to wash her dirty pants and causing trouble, while also slapping her. Wang Chunxiu was crying, while Wang Zhisong went back to his room and tore the paper he had just written to pieces.\u203b\u201cThe best can be found yearly. but this year there are especially many.\u201d This was Shao Yunan\u2019s sentiment that day after he learned from fourth Aunt Wang, who had come specially to gossip with him about the strange things that old lady Wang had done again. The action of that family was really infinitely refreshing, but Wang Shuping\u2019s move to take the silver back directly still took him by surprise. He couldn\u2019t help but wonder if this was Wang Shuping\u2019s own intention or if the patriarch was starting to reflect on it.That family became an even bigger joke, but this time it had nothing to do with Wang Shijing. The construction of their new house was supervised by Uncle Zhou and Old Father Wang, and everything went smoothly. The people hired in the fields were honest and willing to work, and some of them were even from their village, so Wang Shijing was also confident with leaving them in charge. The vegetable field behind the house was also organized and sown, and was given to Wang Qing and Wang Nizi to look after. Wang Shijing looked after the first two every day, but finding that there was no big deal, he went up to the mountains with a basket to pick wild chrysanthemums and some other things to eat. Not to sell for money, but to give Shao Yunan to eat.Although he never reached the end of his passion these nights, his finger already went inside. But he was still afraid of leaving a negative impact on Shao Yunan\u2019s body. But every time Shao Yunan was so hot that he cried, so he could not help but use his fingers.The first batch of tea could already be opened a long time ago, but Shao Yunan didn\u2019t touch it. Mainly because he and Wang Shijing were too busy to drink tea leisurely. They were so busy that they didn\u2019t even have time to sleep, not to mention making and drinking tea. Today, Wang Shijing went up the mountain again, while Shao Yunan hung up the steamed wild chrysanthemums and went into the house.Wang Qing and Wang Nizi were studying in the house, so Shao Yunan went into his space to find a tea set for making Longjing; a purple sand teapot, a tea stove, a small bamboo bucket, and bamboo scoop. The bamboo bucket was still filled with a mixture of spiritual spring water and water from his own well, which did not have as strong a reaction as spiritual essence. But the difference was still obvious. The water at home has always been a mixture of the two kinds of water and Shao Yunan did not plan to change it, even though he didn\u2019t tell Wang Shijing about his spiritual space.Edited by: JaislandProofreader:Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But it was a pity that glass couldn\u2019t be used here, because there was simply no glass in this era! The teacup taken out by Shao Yunan was a blue-and-white porcelain teacup, then he transferred all the prepared tea to the tea jar. He scooped out some of them with a teaspoon and put them in the tea lotus, ready for Wang Shijing to come back.Wang Shuping getting back money was naturally not the intention of the Wang patriarch. But after Wang Shuping returned home and told his father what had happened, Wang Wenhe did not reprimand him, but only sighed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t delay the family\u2019s farm work.\u201d Wang Qian then scolded old lady Wang family again, but this time she was satisfied that the person in charge no longer defended old lady Wang\u2019s family.Wang Shijing would be back before lunch, since Shao Yunan wouldn\u2019t let him leave early and return late like he did before to collect tea, exhausting himself. In addition, Wang Shijing\u2019s intention of picking chrysanthemums was obviously impure, this man had become more and more sullen and coquettish.\u201cIs Uncle Shijing at home?\u201d A hoarse male voice came from outside the house. It was obviously in the middle of a voice change. Shao Yunan, who was taking inventory of their family\u2019s current finances, got off the bed and walked out, while Wang Qing and Nizi looked out. When he opened the door, he saw a young faced man with a slightly tanned skin and a very energetic look. Shao Yunan said gently, \u201cHe went to the mountain. He will be back at noon, what\u2019s the matter?\u201dThe teenager was a little shy and seemed a little afraid of Uncle Shijing\u2019s wife, \u2018who was very tough\u2019 in the eyes of the villagers. He licked his mouth and said, \u201cI told Uncle Shijing about one place that seems to have tea trees and Uncle Shijing asked me to bring it back so he could check it. I brought it back.\u201d\u201cTea tree? Come in.\u201d The teenager looked at Shao Yunan for a while, hesitated for a moment, but then still went in. Shao Yunan just thought that the other person was afraid of him or nervous. But in fact, the teenager was about the same size as Shao Yunan and he was only three years younger than Shao Yunan. Since Wang Shijing was not at home, the teenager still had some scruples, since Shao Yunan was Wang Shijing\u2019s \u2018little\u2019 male wife. Shao Yunan didn\u2019t notice this, nor did he notice that Wang Qing got off the bed and left the room immediately after seeing the teenager\u2019s face. The teenager smiled shyly at Wang Qing and took out two branches from his back basket. \u201cThis is it.\u201d As soon as Shao Yunan looked at the branch, his heart began to beat faster. He almost reached out to grab it. but he first looked at it carefully, then smelled it, and finally put two of the tea leaves into his mouth, almost saying the tea name aloud.Keemun Black Tea! Shao Yunan excitedly looked at the teenager. \u201cWhere did you find this? How much is there?\u201d The teenager was embarrassed by Shao Yunan\u2019s reaction, so he lowered his head and said, \u201cOn the top of the hill on the west. When Uncle Shijing took me to pick tea previously, I thought I saw a few trees that looked like tea trees on the top of the mountain, but they were a little different from the tea trees Uncle Shijing took me to pick, so I wasn\u2019t sure. Today I told Uncle Shijing that I would go and break two branches and come back to show him.\u201d\u201cIt is! It\u2019s a tea tree! How many are there?\u201d Every pore of Shao Yunan\u2019s body trembled.The teenager was happy and a little regretful. \u201cNot many, just a dozen, I didn\u2019t count. I\u2019ll go pick them later.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t, don\u2019t go!\u201d Shao Yunan subconsciously grabbed the teenager\u2019s arm, making Wang Qing purse his lips. The teenager also hurriedly pulled out his arm, like he felt an electric shock. Shao Yunan said, \u201cThis tea cannot be picked now. Keemun Black Tea can only be picked two months before the rainy period, otherwise it would be completely wasted. The place is not far away. Is it easy to get to?\u201dThe young man scratched his head, \u201cNot very easy. It\u2019s on top of the mountain, but I can go up there since I used to go up this mountain to find herbs.\u201d Shao Yunan hurriedly asked, \u201cDoes anyone else know about it?\u201d The young man shook his head. Shao Yunan trembled even more as he took a deep breath to stabilize his mind and showed his kindest smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cMy name is Tang Genshu.\u201d\u201cAh, little Tang, what do you think about this idea? You keep this place a secret for the time being and next year you can pick it, I will ask Uncle Shijing to go with you. But all picked fresh leaves will be yours and I will pay 800 copper coins for one kilo of fresh leaves.\u201d Tang Genshu almost choked and was unable to respond. Shao Yunan became a little anxious. \u201cThis tea is different from the one your Uncle Shijing took you to pick before, so if it can be sold at a good price. Later I will give you even more money.\u201d\u201cNo, no, no.\u201d Tang Genshu\u2019s face immediately reddened. \u201cIt\u2019s too much, too much. I will not talk to anyone about that place and will pick it next year. Uncle Shijing already helped me a lot, so there is no need for extra money.\u201d How can there be such a simple and honest child! Shao Yunan completely forgot that he was now 16 years old and not 26. \u201cThis is what you deserve. Don\u2019t reject it and just listen to me. But you must not tell anyone about this tea.\u201dTang Genshu nodded vigorously. \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d He also wanted to push back, but was blocked by Shao Yunan. \u201cDon\u2019t feel like you are taking advantage of me, in fact I am the one who is taking advantage of you. The tea you found is very rare.\u201d Shao Yunan turned back. \u201cQing, pack some chrysanthemum tea and give it to brother Tang.\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u201d Tang Genshu\u2019s face was so red that it was almost dripping blood. Wang Qing quietly went back to the house to pack the tea, while Shao Yunan looked some more at the branch in his hand, liking it even more. This branch was still alive if he threw it into space later he would have a ready-made Keemun Black Tea cutting.Tang Genshu stood restlessly rubbing his hands, still feeling that he had taken advantage of others. Then Wang Qing came out with a bag of chrysanthemum tea in his hand. Shao Yunan directly picked it up and put it in Tang Genshu\u2019s back basket. \u201cThis is my own chrysanthemum tea. It has a cooling effect and helps clear the liver and eyes. Take it back for your family to try.\u201d\u201cThis is too expensive, I can\u2019t take it.\u201d Tang Genshu said as he stepped closer to the door. Shao Yunan pressed his hand. \u201cIf you are so polite, I will be embarrassed to accept tea from you. Just take it back and drink it.\u201d He still didn\u2019t realize how serious a matter it was for a male wife to have a skin-to-skin contact with a \u2018man\u2019 three years younger than him. Nor did he realize that a teenager about his age calling him \u2018Uncle\u2019 should also be awkward. Shao Yunan smilingly said, \u201cThen I will not keep you here any longer since you are busy. When Uncle Shijing comes back, I will speak with him. Thank you very much little Tang.\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u201d A red-faced Tang Genshu fled. Not only was Uncle Yunan not as scary as it was rumored, but he was too welcoming! As soon as Tang Genshu left, Shao Yunan said, \u201cQing, continue to study, later little father will cook. You and Nizi must keep what happened today a secret, understand?\u201d\u201cYes, don\u2019t worry little father. I\u2019ll help you cook.\u201d\u201cNo, no, little daddy will cook something delicious for you.\u201d Shao Yunan, who was in a very good mood, floated all the way into the kitchen and closed the door before hurriedly putting away the two precious Keemun Black Tea branches into the space. \u201cIt can\u2019t be called Keemun black tea here. It has to be called Xiushui black tea. Ho ho ho ho~\u201d The excited Shao Yunan did not notice Wang Qing\u2019s hesitation. There were only two branches, so Shao Yunan after quickly locking the door, flashed into the space and planted them before watering them with spiritual spring water. Touching the two twigs, Shao Yunan\u2019s eyes glowed. \u201cYou have to grow quickly.\u201dWorried about Wang Qing and Wang Nizi looking for him, Shao Yunan quickly got out of the space. When he got out of the space, he went next door to see how the two children were studying and added hot water to their tea bowls before going back to the kitchen. What the two children were drinking was chrysanthemum sweetwater. The recent weather was very dry so it was very suitable to drink now.The only dough Shao Yunan could make was for dim sum, so since Wang Shijing was not there he just steamed the rice and prepared some stir-fry. After flipping through the recipes in his head, Shao Yunan decided to make Taiwanese lo mein rice for lunch and cook a pot of mushroom and pork soup with mushrooms, and stir-fried shredded potato with vinegar. After thinking about the recipe, Shao Yunan put on his apron and rolled up his sleeves to get ready for work.Wang Qing came out, \u201cLittle father, I\u2019ll help you cook.\u201d Shao Yunan looked at him and said, \u201cNot now, but later help me with starting the fire. If you want to rest, go check the vegetable field and feed water and grass to the cow and sheep.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Wang Qing carried a small bucket of water to the backyard, while Wang Nizi also came out to help her brother with work. The calf they bought would not be able to go to the field until the next year. Shao Yunan also planned to use the two sheep to give the two children milk to drink. In his space there were boxes of milk and also milk powder, but he couldn\u2019t take it out. The water drunk by the calf and sheep also had some spiritual spring water added, because Shao Yunan wanted them to grow stronger and play their role early. But it was a pity that there were no cows, otherwise it would be better to raise a cow since sheep milk had a specific taste.When Shao Yunan made the preparations, Wang Qing and Nizi also finished watering the field and feeding the livestock. Shao Yunan then let Wang Nizi play by herself, while he let Wang Qing help him start the fire. He usually couldn\u2019t start the fire in this ancient rural stove, so he usually asked Wang Shijing or Wang Qing to start it for him. Wang Qing quietly lit the fire, while Nizi, who didn\u2019t go out to play, just sat beside her brother and handed her brother a piece of firewood. In fact, she wanted to see what delicious food her little father would cook. Except for dough, all the meals at home are cooked by her little father and in fact Wang Nizi\u2019s taste buds got a little spoiled.Shao Yunan first cooked the soup, scooped it out, and heated it on the stove, followed by the stir-fried shredded potatoes. The two children kept sniffing and when the smell of stewed meat came out, the two children became hungry.\u201d\u201cDaddy, what is this? It smells good.\u201d Wang Nizi looked into the pot standing on her toes. Shao Yunan smiled and said, \u201cWe will have steamed rice with pork for lunch. This is the stewed meat that will be poured over the rice. Isn\u2019t it fragrant?\u201d\u201cFragrant!\u201d Wang Qing also couldn\u2019t help but look into the pot and just felt his stomach growl. Looking up, Wang Qing couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cLittle father, will you leave father?\u201d Like mother left father\u2026 left them. Shao Yunan put down the meal and touched Wang Qing\u2019s head. \u201cChildren don\u2019t need to have such heavy thoughts. If I wanted to leave, your father must divorce me or I have to divorce him.\u201dWang Qing and Wang Nizi immediately spoke in unison, \u201cFather would not!\u201d Shao Yunan smiled, \u201cSo yeah. That question you just asked is currently invalid.\u201d Wang Qing bit his mouth, but it was hard to hide the joy in his eyes and even Wang Nizi\u2019s smile became bigger. \u201cOkay, you guys go set the table. We will eat in the other room. Dinner will be served when your father comes back. \u201cWang Qing and Wang Nizi immediately went to get the bowls and chopsticks, looking forward to their father coming back soon. They were already hungry. Watching the two children enter the other room, Shao Yunan raised his eyebrow. Are they afraid that he would divorce Wang Shijing? He never thought they could still act so childlike. Turning around, Shao Yunan left Wang Qing\u2019s question behind. He doesn\u2019t know whether Wang Shijing would want to divorce him, but it was true that he was not in the mood to leave now. \u201cIt\u2019s really strange. I don\u2019t like that coquettish stuff.\u201d Shao Yunan ignored the fact that he had let that person eat and touch him all over and was still self-conscious and arrogant.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Before he could even make a sound, Wang Nizi ran out of the house. \u201cFather, you\u2019re back, little father made stewed meat.\u201d Shao Yunan followed out. \u201cWash your hands and eat, we have been waiting for you.\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s one eye looked happy, as he put down his back basket and picked Nizi up with one hand before going into the kitchen.\u201cWipe your eyes and face.\u201d Shao Yunan also went into the kitchen. Wang Nizi, who had already gotten off her father, was going to get the steamer basket, when Wang Qing came in. Shao Yunan handed the steamer basket to Wang Qing and gave the plate with shredded potatoes to Wang Nizi. Wang Shijing\u2019s face was sweaty, so he took off his eye patch, while Shao Yunan took a cloth towel from his hand, wrung it out and wiped his eyes. Wang Shijing\u2019s left eye was blue-gray and the pupil of his eyes also looked like it was behind this blue-gray film, but the corner of his eye no longer had dirt in it.Wang Qing and Wang Nizi understood that they should bring the food to the table first. So when father and little father came in, Wang Nizi scooped rice for the four people. while Wang Shijing bowed his back and let Shao Yunan wipe his eyes. Shao Yunan wiped his eyes carefully and asked, \u201cStill can\u2019t see?\u201d The spiritual spring water could make Wang Shijing\u2019s eye recover. Shao Yunan would have already used the spiritual essence directly, if he wasn\u2019t worried about the adverse consequences caused by too much stimulation. But in fact the most important thing was that Wang Shijing didn\u2019t know about his space\u2019s existence, since Shao Yunan still felt conflicted about it.\u201cStill can\u2019t see, but my eyes don\u2019t hurt anymore. Before everything was black, but now it has turned a little grayish. So maybe it will be okay in the future.\u201d Wang Shijing had already accepted that he had become one-eyed and blind by now, but now he had some hope again. He was 10 years older than Shao Yunan and half of his face was disfigured. And he also had two children\u2026 but if his eye could recover, he could at least move a little more towards being worthy of Shao Yunan.\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you can\u2019t get well, as long as it doesn\u2019t get worse. But it does look a lot better than when I first saw it. Shao Yunan did not care if Wang Shijing could get better and was only afraid that if the eye deteriorated, it would have to be removed. At this time, medical conditions would be quite dangerous. It would be best if no one needed to operate on Wang Shijing.Wang Shijing wiped his eyes, then his face before washing his hands when Shao Yunan come back to the house. Wang Shijing gently touched his left eye through the cloth towel, his heart feeling warm and cozy. His wife acted very tough outside but was very gentle and tender to him. Such a gentle and capable wife, his wife\u2026 The corners of Wang Shijing mouth, which are always tightly pursed outside, faintly raised then he quickly moved to finish his washing because he was hungry.\u201cQing, Nizi eat slowly, don\u2019t choke.\u201d\u201cEat..\u201dAt the dinner table, except for Shao Yunan, all three other family members were burying their heads and eating, like hungry ghosts. The rice with marinara sauce poured over tasted extra special and there were even eggs! Shao Yunan was the one who ate elegantly. After studying all morning and being gluttonous for half a day, the two children feel even hungrier.Shao Yunan eat one bowl of rice, Wang Qing eat two large bowls, Nizi also eats one large bowl while the rest entered the stomach of Wang Shijing. Even the plate was eaten so cleanly that didn\u2019t need to be washed. After eating his fill, Wang Qing touched his stomach, licking his mouth still feeling that he didn\u2019t eat enough.\u201cIn two days little father will cook it again. When you go to private school later, little father will make you a bento.\u201d\u201cBento?\u201d\u201cA bento is a meal brought in a food box.\u201dWang Qing instantly smiled: \u201cThank you, little father!\u201d\u201cGo wash the dishes.\u201dThe two children, neither of whom was reluctant jumped to their feet and gathered the dishes to clean them. In the past, it was painful and sad for the two children to do housework. But now they felt very positive and happy doing it.Wang Shijing breathed a sigh of relief and wrapped his arms around Shao Yunan waist. He couldn\u2019t even dreamed of such days before. Shao Yunan patted his hand around his waist and said\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019ll make you tea.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d Wang Shijing thought it was chrysanthemum tea.\u201cI want to brew Longjing tea.\u201dWang Shijing immediately become interested, he was curious to know how the tea made by Shao Yunan tasted like. When they went out of the room, Shao Yunan shouted: \u201cQing, Nizi wash and bring bowls over, little father will brew tea to drink.\u201d\u201cHey!\u201dWhen they entered his and Shao Yunan room and he saw what was on their table, Wang Shijing looked at Shao Yunan with new wonder. Shao Yunan let him get on the kang and said: \u201cIt is necessary to pay attention to making tea, today I will show you how to drink this Longjing.\u201dWang Shijing smiled faintly and took off his shoes to get on the kang. Shao Yunan scooped two tablespoons of water into a purple porcelain pot and then lit the charcoal under the tea.\u201cThis is the tea table,\u201d Shao Yunan stroked the irregularly curved Huanghuali tea table, it\u2019s also part of the tea art of six gentlemen. Now I will introduce the function of the six gentlemen: this is a tea stove, which boils the tea. This is the tea lotus, to prevent and control the tea leaves when brewing. It also has the function of controlling the tea fragrance, smell it.\u201dWang Shijing picked up the tea lotus, smelled it, and then his one eye gazed up in surprise: \u201cSo fragrant!\u201dIf the tea picked was the spring tea, the tea made would be even more fragrant. But even if this tea smelled good, it would have a different taste after brewing it. The Longjing should be soaked in white porcelain or this kind of blue-and-white porcelain cup, the best cup would be transparent but unfortunately, there isn\u2019t something like this.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of crystal cup do you want?\u201dShao Yunan said helplessly: \u201cHow much does a crystal cup cost?\u201dWang Shijing did not know: \u201cVery expensive. It is something that ordinary people can not touch.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They saw their father and little father sitting on the kang bed surrounded by a lot of things, making them very curious. Letting the two children also come up, Shao Yunan repeated what he already told Wang Shijing. The two children\u2019s big eyes showed some meaning. Unknown, but so powerful!Letting Wang Qing and Nizi smell the aroma of the tea leaves and identify what the Longjing tea leaves smelled like, Shao Yunan said, \u201cQing, Nizi, no matter what tea, infusion of the tea water is the most critical step. The better the water, the better the tea brewed.\u201d The two children nodded their heads seriously.\u201cSecond, the appliance for making tea. For different teas, the appliance used would also need to be different. For drinking tea, not only the taste is important, but also the mood.\u201dNod. Nod.Then Shao Yunan explained how to make Longjing tea to the two children. In the eyes of the children, even though they didn\u2019t understand it fully, it still looked very powerful. So their eyes were filled with admiration. Their little father was very knowledgeable! Wang Shijing\u2019s one eye was also filled with adoration and pride for his wife, but also a little bit of concern. If his wife was too good, he would be snatched away.Shao Yunan spoke seriously as the two children listened carefully, while the water in the teapot boiled. Shao Yunan took down the teapot and continued. \u201cWater for brewing Longjing can not be too hot, so you need to cool down the boiled water a little. Otherwise, you won\u2019t be able to fully express the unique fragrance of Longjing tea. Watch as I do it first and then try it.\u201d\u201cMmm!\u201dThe water for brewing Longjing tea should be around 80 degrees, so when the water temperature was almost ready, Shao Yunan took off the tea lid and let the two children and Wang Shijing first feel the temperature of the water. He then covered it with the lid, before putting about 3 grams of tea leaves in each tea cup and filled it with water to \u00bc mark, so the water and the leaves could spread better. When the second brewing was done, it was time to fill the cups fully.Shao Yunan took the hot teapot and poured water into the teacups, letting the water slide precisely against the wall of the cup. After rotating the tea leaves with hot water, it would give off a different fragrance. The tea itself would bring a kind of relaxed and pleasant visual enjoyment to people. Pouring a certain amount of water into all four tea bowls, the pot of water was all used up. Shao Yunan put the teapot on the tea stove and added cold water.\u201cDaddy, it\u2019s so beautiful\u2026\u201d Nizi looked dumbfounded. Wang Qing looked at the tea bowl that his little father put in front of him, also stunned. \u201cSmell it and see what\u2019s the difference between the smell of the tea leaves and the tea. Then, you can drink it.\u201dThe two children first watched how their little father did it and after learning the manner of smelling tea, they tasted their tea. Wang Shijing, a rough man, could not help but act more sophisticated in this setting. Following Shao Yunan\u2019s example, he picked up the tea bowl, smelled it first and then used the lid to keep away the tea leaves before taking a sip.\u201cDelicious!\u201d Wang Qing looked at his little father with admiration. \u201cIt tastes even better than chrysanthemum tea!\u201dThis Longjing tea was also a bit bitter, but it still tasted extraordinarily good. Wang Qing couldn\u2019t even describe it, but he could only use the term \u201cdelicious\u201d to express the perception of his taste buds at this moment.Nizi then drank her third mouthful, while Wang Shijing put down the teacup and unsparingly praised his wife. \u201cIt\u2019s delicious. Even the generals I fought for during the war certainly did not have this kind of tea to drink.\u201dShao Yunan raised his chin. \u201cOf course. I dare say that no one but me can make this kind of tea.\u201dWang Shijing, Wang Qing, and Wang Nizi immediately nodded in admiration. Shao Yunan then asked directly, \u201cShijing, how about it? Our family\u2019s tea can make money, right?\u201d\u201cIt can make a lot of money!\u201d Wang Shijing has no doubt about his wife\u2019s ability to make money, not to mention that this tea was really very, very good.\u201cLittle father\u2026\u201d Nizi pushed her empty cup towards her little father, her glittering eyes looking at Shao Yunan with a big smile.The Longjing produced by Shao Yunan was of the best quality, so it also would not be a waste to drink it yourself. So he prepared another cup for all three people who enjoyed it very much. Shao Yunan also took this opportunity to tell the two children about tea, telling them that the artistic conception of tea was not as simple as soaking a few leaves and drinking it while it was still fresh. Tea might be simple, but there was no drink in the world that could compete with it.In Wang Shujing\u2019s one eye, there was only Shao Yunan. Suppressing the inferiority complex that surged in his heart, he studied his wife\u2019s sizzling charm, while calculating how he should be even better to his wife, so that he would be more willing to stay with him, Qing, and Nizi. Shao Yunan didn\u2019t want to bear children, but it was okay, as long as he was not unwilling to have only \u2018his\u2019 children. He was not as capable as his wife, not as smart as him, or talented. But as long as his wife wanted something, he will try to get it for him. So his wife could always stay as his wife.The influence of this tea after dinner on Wang Qing and Wang Nizi would never be understood by Shao Yunan. Even many, many years later, when Wang Qing and Wang Nizi have already grown up, they would remember the scene of their little father making tea for them for the first time, in a very dilapidated home. These scenes would often appear in their dreams and were one of their most precious treasures.Shao Yunan put the tea table in Wang Qing and Wang Nizi\u2019s room, leaving a full set of tea and a jar of tea for the two children to learn to make tea after studying. Nizi was still young, so Shao Yunan urged her to ask her brother for help at first, to avoid her being scalded. Wang Qing and Wang Nizi touched the beautiful tea table and touched the beautiful teacup, not wanting to sleep at all.Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing laid in the bed for a nap, but Wang Shijing did not feel sleepy at all. Hugging Shao Yunan and touching him through his clothes, Wang Shijing asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to give this Longjing tea and chrysanthemum tea to county magistrate Jiang and dean Cen? Or will you sell it to Yizhang Xuan restaurant?\u201dShao Yunan closed his eyes to rest while lazily replaying. \u201cWhen the wine is ready, it will be sent over. I don\u2019t want to give them every good thing either. Although I want to get acquainted with them, I don\u2019t have to be so obsequious. At present, the big boss behind the Yizhang Xuan restaurant is the best choice, but there is no hurry. New year\u2019s is the peak season for gift-giving. Before that, we should prepare tea and make a better package for it. Adding a little different mood will also make the price higher. As for the wine, I\u2019ll think about it. Taking everything to Yizhang Xuan restaurant without having any competitive pressure, would not be good for us.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s up to you.\u201d Thinking about the fragrance of the wine when the barrel was changed the second time, Wang Shijing swallowed his saliva and couldn\u2019t wait to drink it. His Yunan was really the most capable!\u201cAs for the chrysanthemum tea\u2026\u201d Shao Yunan rolled over, faced Wang Shijing, and raised his foot to his leg. \u201cAt first, I had a plan to give it to Wang Shuping, but when I thought of his father, I wanted to transfer it to Aunt Wang. But there are too many shameless people in the Wang family. I\u2019m afraid Aunt Wang\u2019s house can\u2019t deal with it. Even if they don\u2019t care about Wang Wenhe, there are still other elders. Let me think about it some more. There is still time before the farming period ends.\u201dDespite the fact that Wang Shijing hired workers for only 20 days, turning the land and sowing the seeds took time. It took a month to finish all the work and after that, there still needed to be regular weeding, watering, and so on. Although Aunt Wang\u2019s land was less than his family\u2019s, Aunt Wang\u2019s family did not have many people and they did not hire laborers.Calculating it, they needed forty days. Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan bought a total of twenty acres of mountain land and ten acres of dry land, which Wang Shijing used to plant winter wheat, with potatoes, white radish, onion, pumpkin, cabbage and other winter grains. But the mountainous land needed to be thoroughly fertilized once and cultivated for a while before growing food.The climate of Xiushui Village was similar to that of Jiangnan, but it was drier than Jiangnan, so there were many crops that could be grown. Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing just bought the fields, so they missed a lot of staple food planting time. Other families were harvesting corn, soybeans, and other crops while planting new crops, but they had nothing to harvest.Until it snowed, Wang Shijing planned to go into the mountains several times to get some more dry food before winter. Shao Yunan will make several kinds of pickles and buy some more pickles from the villagers. Cabbages, potatoes, and pumpkins could be kept in the cellar. In the new house designed by Shao Yunan, there would be a heated room, so they could grow vegetables to eat in the winter. But next year, Shao Yunan planned to find a way to \u2018increase\u2019 it by several vegetables. He wants to openly eat tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, broccoli\u2026 and so on.Wang Shijing said, \u201cOr, let\u2019s give it to Uncle Sun. The patriarch and Uncle Sun are cousins.\u00a0 Grandpa Sun is the only doctor in our village and his family has a large population. Didn\u2019t Brother Shuping say that Grandpa Sun has a good relationship with the shopkeeper of the pharmacy in the county town? You also said\u00a0 that you can take this chrysanthemum tea to the pharmacy and sell it, so you wouldn\u2019t have to go to the Yizhang Xuan restaurant.\u201dShao Yunan thought about the feasibility. \u201cFirst, there is no hurry. With the climate here, the wild chrysanthemum on the mountain can bloom again, just after farming.\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201dShao Yunan was not in a hurry, but some people were very anxious. When the couple lay on the bed together under the pretext of taking a nap, someone came knocking on the door.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wang Shijing quickly opened the courtyard door. Inside the house, Shao Yunan had also gotten up from the bed, got dressed, and rolled up the bedding before putting it away.The person outside the door was indeed Grandpa Sun. \u201cShijing, Grandpa Sun didn\u2019t disturb you and Yunan, right?\u201d Shao Yunan was a male wife, so Grandpa Sun couldn\u2019t directly ask if Shao Yunan was at home, even if he actually came to meet Shao Yunan. \u201cNo, please come inside Grandpa Sun.\u201d Shao Yunan also came out at that time. \u201cMaster Sun.\u201d\u201cGrandpa Sun wants to talk to you about something.\u201d\u201cCome in and sit down, Master Sun.\u201d Shao Yunan invited him inside, while Wang Shijing went to pour some water. Grandpa Sun entered the room, sat down on the kang, and said with a bit of embarrassment on his face, \u201cYunan, that boy Genshu brought me some chrysanthemum tea and said that you gave it to him. This chrysanthemum tea is a very good thing, so grandpa wants to buy some from you. Do you have a lot of it?\u201dShao Yunan smiled. \u201cMaster Sun, what a coincidence. I was just talking to Brother Shijing about sending you some tonight. I think this stuff could be used as medicine. Brother Shuping said that you are friends with the head of the pharmacy in the county town.\u201dGrandpa Sun was delighted. \u201cWhat a coincidence. Genshu heard you say that this thing helps to clear the liver, improve eyesight, and reduce fevers, so he sent some to me to ask if his mother can drink it. I checked the chrysanthemum tea and it was indeed very good! I also use chrysanthemum in some medicines, but compared to your tea, my medicine is much worse. It also tastes very bad.\u201d\u201cSometimes when there is very little sunlight, the medicine would get moldy and the medicinal properties will spoil. Yunan, if you have more of the chrysanthemum tea, sell some to grandpa. Also, the boss of the \u2018Yongning Hall\u2019 in the county town is familiar with me. He is an honest person, so if you want to sell it, you can sell it to him. It will not be a loss for you and he might even order more!\u201dWang Shijing came in with a cup of chrysanthemum tea and put it in front of Grandpa Sun. Grandpa Sun said, \u201cLook, it\u2019s so well dried. Not to mention, as a medicine\u2026 even as a drink, it\u2019s beautiful and tasty.\u201d Shao Yunan\u2019s Longjing tea had not yet been taken outside, so Wang Shijing did not brew the Longjing tea. He just sat down next to Shao Yunan and did not talk.Shao Yunan looked at Wang Shijing with a look of \u2018You call the shots and getting \u2018encouragement\u2019. He turned to grandpa Sun. \u201cMaster Sun, I made this chrysanthemum tea on a whim and never thought about whether it can make money or not. If you think it\u2019s good, why don\u2019t you make it yourself?\u201dGrandpa Sun froze, not understanding. \u201cWhat? You don\u2019t want to do this business? This stuff will definitely sell for money. Other people might not understand, but some poisons can also be used as medicine if they are dried well. I have never seen such good dried chrysanthemums. It\u2019s not worse than your jam recipe.\u201dShao Yunan said, \u201cMaster, you misunderstood. I know this chrysanthemum tea of mine is definitely good. It\u2019s just that the process of making this chrysanthemum tea is very troublesome, much more troublesome than the jam that I handed over to uncle Zhao. Also my family is small and Shijing and I need to do a lot of things, so we don\u2019t have the energy to make large quantities of the jam. It\u2019s the same with this chrysanthemum tea.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t think that the whole process is only drying the chrysanthemums in the sun. It takes at least half a month to make, which is troublesome, but it is also a delicate process. Grandpa, as you might already know, Uncle Sun, Aunt Sun, Erjiang, and Sun Xiao Jiang are familiar with my family. Especially Erjiang and Sun Xiao Jiang, who are also good brothers. So why don\u2019t I give you this recipe, so your family can do this business.\u201dMaster Sun, who finally understood, immediately shook his head. \u201cNo, no, this is not possible, absolutely not.\u201d Wang Shijing spoke. \u201cMaster, you should listen to Yunan first.\u201d Shao Yunan continued, \u201cGrandpa Sun, this chrysanthemum tea is different from a jam. Shijing and I really want to give it to someone who has been kind to our family. Originally, I wanted to give it to Aunt Wang\u2019s family, but when Wang Dafu\u2019s family came, I became worried that I would cause trouble for Aunt Wang\u2019s family instead. Aunt Wang\u2019s family can\u2019t be compared to Uncle Zhao\u2019s family after all.\u201d Grandpa Sun frowned. \u201cThere are so many people in the village who are not right-minded.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As I said before, this chrysanthemum tea takes at least 15 days to complete, but it still needs the weather to be quite good to make it. Shijing and I collected many tea leaves before, since I really want to get into the tea business. But tea is also time-consuming and labor-intensive, so how would I still have the energy to tinker with other things?\u201d\u201cI also made this chrysanthemum tea after I came across some chrysanthemums, when I went to the mountains with Shijing. I just picked some and made it by hand. If you didn\u2019t come over, I would only hold onto the recipe for a while before giving it to someone else to make later. Giving you the tea can also be considered as earning reputation for Shijing and I later.\u201cMaster Sun, we can only rely on you to take care of it. Shijing and I might as well sell you the production method. Although Shijing is a member of the Wang clan, we can\u2019t count on the clan. If in the future Wang Zhisong really earns merit on the imperial examination, we will need people in the village like Grandpa Sun or Uncle Zhao to take care of us, so we won\u2019t be in too much trouble.\u201dGrandpa Sun immediately said in a rough voice, \u201cIt would be a wonder if Wang Zhisong could earn merit on the examination, you don\u2019t need to fear him. You also should not pay attention to your family clan. No one in the county town does not know what Wang Zhisong has done. With so many people taking the exam, why should they want him, who is known for his bad character? I haven\u2019t liked this kid since before.\u201d\u201cThis time so many things happened, but he never came back or admitted his mistake. Wang Wenhe did so much for him and made his family worry when he was splashed with dirty water because of him, but he never went to his door to apologize.\u201d Master Sun, who often went to the county town pharmacy to buy herbs, knew that Wang Zhisong became famous in the county town and it was not because of his good name.Shao Yunan listened to this with pleasure, but didn\u2019t show it on his face. He only said, \u201cShijing and I need to prepare for the worst and think about Wang Qing and Nizi. We can take out the recipe and earn money ourselves, but what will the village people say? Uncle Zhao is the head of the village, but still many people gossip behind his back. Master Sun, just take this recipe for the chrysanthemum tea and let the Sun family\u2019s reputation sell it well. If something really happens to our family in the future, at least some people will remember our good deeds and not do things that get in our way.\u201dGrandpa Sun thought deeply. How could he not understand Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing\u2019s meaning? But it felt like he came here specifically to ask for a bargain\u2026 Wang Shijing spoke out, \u201cMaster Sun, why don\u2019t you go back and discuss it with Patriarch Sun, Uncle Sun, Aunt Sun, and the others? Yunan and I really want to hand it over to you. My family also does not intend to rely on this to earn money, since Yunan and the children can\u2019t get so tired.\u201dMaster Sun considered it for a long time before slapping his thigh. \u201cI will go back and discuss this with them! Shijing, Yunan, Grandpa Sun has really taken advantage of you.\u201d Shao Yunan laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to say. In the future, if someone bullies our family, I\u2019ll need to go to master Sun.\u201dMaster Sun laughed. After drinking the chrysanthemum tea in his cup, he wiped his mouth, got off the bed, and left. As soon as he left, Shao Yunan poked Wang Shijing. \u201cNow our family has another mountain to rely on.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all because of my wife\u2019s wisdom.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d This person is not only getting smoother and smoother, but also more and more coy.\u201cBy the way, I forgot to tell you an important thing. Tang Genshu came over in the morning and brought two tea tree branches. It\u2019s another very precious tea tree. It\u2019s a kind of black tea, but very different from Longjing. He said he already talked to you.\u201dWang Shijing nodded. \u201cWell, Tang Genshu told me that there are trees like that on the eastern side of the mountain, so I asked him to pick them and show them to you.\u201d Shao Yunan said, \u201cHe said that these tea trees are on the top of the mountain. Isn\u2019t that dangerous?\u201d\u201cOn the top of the mountain?\u201d Wang Shijing was surprised. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me it was on top of the mountain. This kid is too bold. There are wolves on that mountain.\u201d\u201cAh! How dangerous! Don\u2019t let him go alone. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201dWang Shijing frowned. \u201cThat child is also a hard worker. He must have lied to me because he wanted to earn more money. His grandfather is Wang Bensheng, Wang Benchang\u2019s brother, so he can be called Wang Dafu\u2019s cousin. His mother\u2019s name is Yumei, but his father has already passed away, so sister-in-law Yumei\u2019s life has not been easy after she was taken back by her two brothers to her maiden house.\u201d\u201cSister Yumei\u2019s brother and sister-in-law cannot accommodate the three of them, so Yumei\u2019s parents, who live with her second brother, also can\u2019t take care of them. Uncle Zhao rented two acres of land to them and lent them a dilapidated house in the village. Only then did the three of them have a place to live. I think Genshu is a clever one. He is also willing to endure hardship, so I took him to pick tea, and hired him to help farm our family land.\u201dShao Yunan was speechless. \u201cThe Wang clan really produces strange people. Is your patriarch incompetent or did you just meet with such a clan member? Doesn\u2019t Wang Wenhe care?\u201d Wang Shijing was also a bit helpless. \u201cSister Yumei moved out of the clan after she got married, so their family is not considered a part of the Wang clan. To say\u2026 at least Wang Bensheng\u2019s family doesn\u2019t care, so the patriarch is even less likely to care.\u201dShao Yunan asked, \u201cHow old is he? He has a younger brother?\u201d\u201cThirteen. His younger brother is Gensheng. He is as old as our Qing.\u201d Shao Yunan understood that the reason why Wang Shijing was willing to help this family was because of him, so he just said, \u201cIf you want to help them, help them. But, Shijing, I won\u2019t think of any way to make money for their family. In their family situation, it would be like giving them a wedding dress for others to wear.\u201d Shao Yunna did not feel at ease about Wang Benchang\u2019s family.Wang Shijing said, \u201cWe can\u2019t give recipes to every family. But we can help uncle and aunt Zhou with a different method. Uncle Zhou and aunt Zhao have only three people in their family, while Zhou Tianbao is a fool, so giving them a recipe would only cause trouble for them. In the future, let them do clothes for us and when we start raising chickens and pigs at our house, let them look after them so that their livelihood can be guaranteed, but not attract too much bad attention from others. The same should be true for Tang Genshu\u2019s family. Sister Yumei is a widow, so only Genshu can help us, if we don\u2019t want gossip. But if you give her a recipe because we are both men, there would be gossip.\u201dShao Yunan nodded. He didn\u2019t expect Wang Shijing to have already thought about it. \u201cThen you should speak to aunt and uncle Zhou, and not let them have any ideas.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already mentioned it to Uncle Zhou. He also thinks it\u2019s good. His family only has five acres of land, just enough for Zhou Tianbao to take care of alone. In the future, if I help Uncle Zhou buy a cow, he wouldn\u2019t even need to hire anyone to help and since their family will help with our family with work, we can pay them more.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. By the way, we have to let auntie Zhou make some cotton-padded clothes, winter quilts, and cotton shoes. Aunt Zhou\u2019s craftsmanship is good, so as long as Aunt Zhou has no problem with her eyes, I will let her make all our clothes and quilts in the future.\u201d\u201cGood. When we\u2019re done, we\u2019ll go to the county town to buy cloth and cotton.\u201d\u203bThe two of them irresponsibly left all their worries to Grandpa Sun.Wang Shijing, who returned in the afternoon after a walk to the fields, went to the site of the new house. Shao Yunan wanted to give the chrysanthemum tea to Grandpa Sun\u2019s family, so Wang Shijing stopped to pick wild chrysanthemums. The chrysanthemums picked today were left to dry and would be steamed tomorrow, so he stayed home with Shao Yunan, drinking tea as the two children studied under Shao Yunan\u2019s tutoring. This was one of the most enjoyable moments of the day for Wang Shijing.Wang Shijing also told Tang Genshu not to go up to the top of the mountain alone in the future. If he had an accident, what would he tell his mother? Tang Genshu\u2019s mother, Wang Yumei, had been in poor health since his father passed away. Since their family had no money and their land was rented, young Tang Genshu needed to support his family.He would often go up the mountain to pick some medicinal herbs for his mother\u2019s illness. Wang Shijing also told Tang Genshu straightforwardly that if he helped their family with work, he would get paid wages. He also would be the one responsible for the tea picking in the future. Tang Genshu\u2019s eyes were red\u2026 he really didn\u2019t know why Wang Shijing took special care of him.For dinner, Wang Shijing baked pancakes and cooked millet porridge, while Shao Yunan fried shredded potatoes with vinegar, which his two children liked to eat very much. He also fried meat and vegetables, and rolled the shredded potatoes, sliced meat, and wild vegetables with some sauce. Wang Shijing ate three mouthfuls at once, while Shao Yunan ate three pancakes, his appetite very average. Drinking the millet porridge, he said, \u201cWhen we move to the new house, I will prepare roast duck for you. If we make smaller pancakes that were thinner and smear them with sauce while rolling them with sliced roast duck and shredded green onion the taste would be\u2026\u201dShao Yunan drooled. Wang Qing and Wang Nizi also licked their mouths as they listened to Shao Yunan drooling. Wang Shijing made a decision. \u201cI will buy chickens and ducks, and also two pigs after moving to the new house.\u201d Shao Yunan, \u201cThere is also sheep. We can kill them in the winter and eat mutton. But I can\u2019t feed them.\u201d\u201cLittle father, I will.\u201d Wang Nizi raised her hand, just like she was taught by her little dad. \u201cI will too.\u201d Wang Qing said. Wang Shijing said, \u201cYou guys study hard. Daddy will find someone to feed them.\u201dShao Yunan said, \u201cI will buy a plot of land by the river in the future, so we can dig a pond and raise fish. It is better for little Qing and Nizi to eat more fish, so they can be smart.\u201d As soon as the two children heard that they can become smarter by eating fish, they looked at their father, but Wang Shijing just said, \u201cGood.\u201d The two children grinned. Wang Shijing reached out to roll another pancake, when someone knocked on the door. \u201cShijing, are you home?\u201dMaster Sun!Wang Qing quickly got off the bed and put on his shoes before running out to open the courtyard door. Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing also got off the bed and put on their shoes immediately. Outside, Wang Qing opened the door and greeted Grandpa Sun and Uncle Sun, one by one. Grandpa Sun, Patriarch Sun, Uncle Sun, Aunt Sun Guan, Sun Erjiang, and Sun Xiaojiang all came together.Once they saw Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing, the gratitude of the group was overwhelming. Wang Shijing guided the group to Wang Qing and Nizi\u2019s room, while Shao Yunan let the two children continue to eat. Wang Qing, seeing that everyone gathered in the room, together with Wang Nizi, took the porridge, pancakes, and vegetables that their Dad and Little Dad hadn\u2019t finished drinking to the stove top to keep it warm.The grandfather did not tell anyone about the tea matter after he returned, but asked his grandson Sun Xiaojiang to take him to the county town and took the chrysanthemum tea given to him by Tang Genshu to the \u2018Yongning Hall\u2019 to show the pharmacy\u2019s boss. The boss asked master Sun if he dried the chrysanthemums himself. Master Sun said no and asked boss Feng to prepare a cup of the chrysanthemum tea. After boss Feng drank it, he said he wanted to buy it. As the head of the pharmacy, boss Feng knew the value of the dried chrysanthemums as well as master Sun.Whether it was their own dried chrysanthemum or collected elsewhere, you should always be careful of mold. But the color and taste was definitely not comparable to the dried chrysanthemum brought by Master Sun, not to mention the dried chrysanthemum could also be used as tea. The boss listened to Master Sun\u2019s advice and put in a few pieces of licorice. He then looked at master Sun as if he had seen a gold mountain.The dried chrysanthemum flowers were carefully looked at and observed while the tea was seriously tasted again and again. Then he finally opened his mouth and stated a price of two taels of silver a kilo and how much he wished to buy. Grandpa Sun said that someone else asked him to ask, making boss Geng drag Grandpa Sun to ask the person who made this dried chrysanthemum to sell it to Yongning Hall.Master Sun left the shop with a trembling heart. He didn\u2019t let Sun Xiaojiang follow him in, making Sun Xiaojiang wonder why his grandfather didn\u2019t buy anything after he ran to Yongning Hall in such a hurry. When their family finally came home for dinner from the field that evening, Grandpa said that Shijing and his wife had found a special way to earn money for their Sun family and only then did Sun Xiaojiang learn why grandpa Sun went to Yongning Hall.Patriarch Sun was the nephew of Grandpa Sun, so when Grandpa Sun talked about the chrysanthemum tea, he called over patriarch Sun. Once they heard that this chrysanthemum tea could be sold to Yongning Hall for two taels of silver a kilo, even the shy Sun Xiaojiang spat out the water in his mouth. This time, Uncle Sun\u2019s family exploded. The Sun patriarch also could not calm down. Shijing and Yunan were really giving them such a way to earn money? This is why after eating, their family came over, while poor Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan still haven\u2019t finished eating yet.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, the attitude of the two people was still the same and they did not intend to do it themselves. Grandpa Sun and patriarch Sun tried to persuade them, otherwise, they might be suspected of bullying people. Shao Yunan also did not try to evade and directly explained the method of making this chrysanthemum tea: \u201cIt\u2019s not that me and Shijing and relucant to work hard but as you heard before the process of making this tea is really troublesome. In the spring of next year, we plan to send Wang Qing to private school, also we want to find a female teacher to teach Nizi how to play zither. But at home it just me and Shijing, we need to take care of our land and tea we collected while the wild chrysanthemum grows several times a year. Shijing and me are just too busy.\u201cGrandpa Sun, Patriarch Sun and uncle Sun are all good people and you were always been very supportive of me and Shijing so I feel confident to leave this method to you. Besides, there are a lot of wild chrysanthemums in the mountains, so for small family like us it would really be too much to handle.\u00a0 Besides, sooner or later, the price charged by \u2018Yongning Hall\u201d would be spread to the village so only grandpa and Patriarch Sun can back it down. But I have a small suggestion. After earning money, Patriarch Sun can buy more public land for the clan, and the money from this public land can help the children of the clan to study. If anyone can be admitted to county school or take examination they can be given a reward, the better place in the examination the better the reward. In this way people from the clan will not say anything. Wasn\u2019t working hard and earning money for the sake of the future generations?\u201dPatriarch Sun smiled: \u201cThey say you have a lot of ideas, but this is really a great idea.\u00a0 Well, since you and Shijing already talked about it and already stated the method directly if we don\u2019t take it, we will be ungrateful. Brother Yunan, Zhao Lizheng family used three hundred taels of silver to buy your jam recipe, and 10% of the profit. But this chrysanthemum tea is even more expensive than jam so we offer our hundred taels. First we will give you 50 teas of silver and then chrysanthemum tea is sold we will give you the rest of silver. As for the profit, 40% while be share the rest among ourselves.\u201dShao Yunan laughed: \u201cIt didn\u2019t take so much, it was just for the outsiders to hear. I just collected 100 teals of silver from uncle Zhao and profit of 10% was also just for two years. It just that 10% of red sour fruits uncle Zhao collect is given to me. So I will sell tea repcipe also for 100 teals of silver and take 10&amp; of profit only for two years.\u00a0 Grandpa Sun is good person and if Patriarch Sun also help even if it wasn\u2019t me or Shijing it good for Qing and Nizi to accumulate some blessing.\u201dThe people of the Sun family were moved by what they heard. Wang Shijing suffered so much before but in the end he was most concerned about the village. The patriarch was also decisive as he spoke: \u201cI accept your hearts on behalf of the Sun clan and my Sun family. We will take this house for 200 taels, so don\u2019t push it. When I earn money, I will buy more public land, and will also give 10% of the profit so that the children can learn.\u201dWang Shijing spoke up: \u201cUncle Sun, Yunan and I want to buy the mountain to the west.\u201dMatriarch Sun immediately said, \u201cOkay, we won\u2019t go there.\u00a0 But you have to buy it as soon as possible, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\u201cWell, we\u2019ll definitely buy it before the end of year.\u201dShao Yunan said: \u201cThen let\u2019s make deeds. This recipe I can also be sold to others under the premise of ensuring that it would not affect your interests. While I don\u2019t care who you want to disclose it to.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dPatriarch Sun wrote the deed so both sides wouldn\u2019t have a problem then they signed and sealed it. But this time Shao Yunan did not sign his name, he let Wang Shijing sign his name and press his handprint. The patriarch of Sun clan also said that when they begin to earn money he will call clan meeting about future founding of clan children study. In short, it was to prevent members of Sun clan from causing trouble for Shao Yunan. As for whether the clan would have its own ideas patriarch Sun was confident that he was not Wang Wenhe who couldn\u2019t even punish his own clan members.Grandpa Sun has three brothers, and all three brothers had many children. Clan patriarch was also from their own family so not only it was big family in Sun clan but also in Xiushui Village. The profit of this chrysanthemum tea would be so high that Uncle Sun and Aunt Sun knew they couldn\u2019t take care of it alone. But with having their father-in-law and cousin step in, they could earn money without worrying about the bad things that may happen.Grandpa Sun and Patriarch Sun both knew that the Sun family took advantage of Sun Erjiang and Sun Xiaojiang this time but Aunt and uncle Sun were still happy. Sun Erjiang especially rushed with Shijing to the county town to help his wife and was willing to help their family. Anyway, no matter what happen to Shijing family in the future, he and Xiaojiang would definitely go through fire and water to help them.After leaving Wang Shijing and walking for a while Patriarch Sun shook his head: \u201cWang Dali and his wife are both blind. Without this son, its not strange that they think they can count only on Wang Zhisong.\u201d\u201cThat family is not able to conduct itself, so don\u2019t mention them.\u201d Grandpa Sun hurriedly said: \u201cGo back and do a good job of planning.:\u201cMm.\u201dAfter bidding goodbye members of Sun family Shao Yunan suddenly asked, \u201cHave you eaten enough?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dWang Shijing took Shao Yunan hand and pulled him inside the house to continue eating. Shao Yunan grinned, pulled out his hand and jumped on Wang Shijing\u2019s back. Wang Shijing staggered for a step but then firmly supported Shao Yunan by his buttocks.\u201cWife, why did you ask me to sign it?\u201d\u201cYou are the head of the family.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWang Shijing carried his wife only to feel that his wife was too light and needed to be fattened up.The two did not mention the matter of chrysanthemum tea again as they eat their previously unfinished meal. Then Wang Shijing boiled a large pot of hot water while Shao Yunan cleaned after the meal and letting the two children wash up. Then they went together inside their room and closed the door.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 71": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fierce \u201cHusband\u201dCH 36.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 36.2Shao Yunan didn\u2019t bother to care about how the Sun family was going to distribute, so Wang Shihing also didn\u2019t ask Sun Erjiang about it. The next day at noon, Uncle Sun came over with 50 teals of silver, it was not one ingot but scattered silver and copper coin. That day, Sun Erjiang and Sun Xiaojian also did not go to the fields and went together to the mountains.The Sun family did not collect wild chrysanthemums from the villagers, but from the next day onwards, Master Sun rarely showed up and was always at home. The villagers didn\u2019t know that the backyard of grandpa Sun house was full of wild chrysanthemums drying in the sun. The whole Sun family stayed up all night, making up dozens of bamboo steaming trays.Burning this time, the shape of Wang Shijing\u2019s new house began to appear making everyone in the village realize at how how big a house Wang Shijing\u2019s family was going to build when they bought such a large land. As soon as shape come out, it naturally attracted a lot of discussion. Thirty acres of land were all sown, and the vegetable field in the backyard also emerged. Just when the villagers were staring at Wang Shijing\u2019s house, the first batch of chrysanthemum tea made by the main family of the Sun clan was delivered to \u201cYongning Hall\u201d on the same day. Then Grandpa Sun came over in person and gave a bag of chrysanthemum tea he made himself as well a whole ingot worth fifty silverThe chrysanthemum tea made by the Sun family tasted worse than Shao Yunan and its appearance might also not be as beautiful as his. After all Shao Yunan used spiritual spring water and was pretty skilled. However, boss Feng did not lower the price and still paid two teals of silver, after all even if it tasted a little worse it was still very good compared to others. The first batch alone of chrysanthemum tea earned Sun family nearly 200 teals of silver. The wild chrysanthemums were all picked by their own family members, while Grandpa Sun also planted one acre of chrysanthemums, which would come in handy in the future. Just like the Zhao Lizheng family, the mainfamily of Sun clan had a male wife as daughters-in-law as wall as daughters and sons who are still to be married off. All the people who were told about this by the patriarch and participated in this matter tried their best to pick all the wild chrysanthemums they could. They also planed as a clan to set aside few acres of land to plant chrysanthemums.Then it come time to share the money, naturally the cost of picking wild chrysanthemums was not counted. So after a single sale the Sun clan patriarch got pretty nice net profit. Wild chrysanthemum does not bloom in the coldest four months of the year, but for the remaining eight months they continued to bloom so how much they could earn in a year? The boss Feng was still promoting the sale of goods but how many pharmacies and tea stores there was in their province? After getting this chrysanthemum tea, the owner of Yongning Hall become very ambitious and wanted to spread the reputation of Yongning Hall thought the whole province.When the patriarch Sun saw this situation, he discussed it with grandpa Sun and immediately called respected clan elders for meeting. Any family with good character and kindness in their clan could join this business. While Patriarch Sun\u2019s family accounts for 50% of the profits, 10% of which went to Shao Yunan while the remaining half went for public use like buying land and sponsoring clan children to study. The remaining 40% was set aside by Patriarch Sun family according to the number of families involved in production of chrysanthemum tea. Of course, this distribution would not be disclosed to all the clan members.The Sun clan was dazzled by the pie that fell down from the sky during this busy farming season. Except for a few unreliable families that were excluded, almost every family in the Sun clan could participate. Some of the participating families even set aside some land to plant chrysanthemums.After the Sun patriarch left, Uncle Zhao Lizheng asked his eldest son to call Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan over.The two of them went to Zhao Lizheng house where Zhao Lizheng together with Zhao Yuande and Zhao Yuanqing were all present. Then Zhao Lizheng told the directly what he heard from Patriarch Sun about the chrysanthemum tea. Zhao Lizheng also thought Shao Yunan\u2019s idea was very good, and he also decided to fund the children of his clan in the village who did not have the clan\u2019s blessing to study, with a reward for good performance. The goat\u2019s milk fruit was gone and the Yizhang Xuan was also out of the stock. Hearing that Zhao Lizheng begin collecting red dates and hawthorn, Yizhang Xuan boss Xu observed them for some time, sending people over every day to ask when they can start making them.The Zhao Lizheng family was also worried, they collected a lot but Shao Yunan told them not to rush and wait until the end of year before preparing it. Uncle Zhao Lizheng also wanted to pull more people in this business and plant few acres of goat\u2019s milk fruit so he called Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan over to explain the whole matter and then ask them whether they want to plant goat\u2019s milk fruit, while also remind them that Wang Shijing surname was Wang. After such a big deal in both Zhao and Sun family, the Wang clan couldn\u2019t justify it.Wang Shijing did not speak when the topic turned to the Wang clan, if he wanted to break away from the clan he needed patriarch to remove him. Also, he himself he no feeling for Wang clan but then Shao Yunan said: \u201cUncle Zhao, if you want to make this jam into an industry of the Zhao clan like the Patriarch Sun, you and big brother Yuande can discuss it. I already sold you recipe so you should make your own decision how to do business.\u201d\u201cThis year, when buying New Year\u2019s goods and giving gifts you should lunch red date jam and hawthorn ham that could be sold at the higher price. Although it is said that business is based on honesty, but sometimes you can not be too honest. You have to have a plan of what jam to offer in which season. You can also add some ginger to red date ham, woman likes to drink it very much. After you make it the price can also be a little higher. As long as women from rich families know this thing is good they definitely won\u2019t care about money To be honest I don\u2019t know for how long we can sell jam so you should rise your worth when you can.\u201dZhao Lizheng, Zhao Yuande and Zhao Yuanqing all thought it made sense. But they still feel little guilty about Yizhang Xuan restaurant, but now that Shao Yunan said this they immediately put their heart at ease, Shao Yunan was always right when it come to doing business.\u201cAs for planting a few acres of goat\u2019s milk fruit, I think it\u2019s good, not only goat\u2019s milk fruit but also peaches, apricots as well as some wild fruits tress from the mountain that can be moved over and planted. If you are afraid that the villagers would have opinions, then cut some branches and wait a few years. Uncle Lizheng you are good at farming so fruits trees would certainly not be a problem. My family is no longer involved since we also have land at home, Shijing and I also plan to buy mountains on the west side and grow things there. Uncle Zhao you help me collect some if you can. As for Wang\u2019s side, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to help, it\u2019s just that they should fix themselves a bit first. If I give Wang clan in its current situation such a big deal, not only it would not end well but it might also turn problematic. Trying to exchange a bag of rice and piece of meat for my tea making method. Doing things so blatantly would only finding trouble.\u201dZhao Lizheng shook his head and sighed: \u201cPatriarch Wang was too partial to your family so in the end other clan members started not to trust him. Luckily, Wang Shuping is good one but he is still too young to overpower the old ones. The Wang clan needs a person who can convince the public and suppress the people so your concern are also right. But after all, there are also people in the Wang clan that are sincere to you, so you have to take care of them.\u201d\u201cWell, we will repay them.\u201d\u201cIf you guys have thought about it, I won\u2019t say more.\u201dWang Shijing said, \u201cUncle Zhao, do you know about Tang brothers, right?\u201dZhao Lizheng nodded: \u201c\u201dYes, I know. After all his family\u2019s land is rented from my family.\u201dWang Shijing said, \u201cUncle Zhao, that boy Genshu is very good so I and Yunan are willing to help him. But the situation of sister Yumei is not the same, if I help too much it will be easy to cause trouble and gossip instead. If the younger brother is smart, you and uncle Sun should pay for his education together. In the future, if Genshu can support his family you won\u2019t have to worry about it anymore. I will hire Genshu to help my family with the work but its really not good for me to meddle in Gensheng and his mother\u2019s affairs.\u201dZhao Lizheng understood his meaning and just said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, your uncle Sun and I will help since you asked. It also true after all, Yumei is a widow. Although Genshu and Gensheng are surnamed Tang, they are also cousins to Wang Benchang family so it would be better for you and Yunan not to involved with them. That child Genshu might look introverted but is also in fact ruthless, when he grows up a little more he will be able to protect his mother and his brother.\u201dWang Shijing also saw Tang Genshu tough heart thought his shy appearance so he was willing to help him. If he had soft nature he would be more hesitate.When he saw Tang Genshu and Tang Gengsheng, Wang Shijing thought of his own son and daughter. But if he directly funded Tang Gengsheng studies the village people would inevitably start gossiping what else he was founding. Not to mention that many people in the Wang clan were not right-minded not only his own mother knew how to make trouble so leaving this matter to Zhao Lizheng and patriarch Sun would be the most appropriate. Anyway the two of them planned to found studying of village children. Tang Genshu and Tang Gengsheng were not considered Wang\u2019s clan members, so Zhao Lizheng and uncle Sun would not hit the face of the Wang clan.Two people came out of the Zhao Lizheng house and went home together hand in hand. After dark, Xiushui Village was very quiet. In order to save lamp oil, the villagers would rest after eating. Now that it was busy farming period, everyone would also go to the bed earlier. Walking in the fields, they were only accompanied by sound of chirping and buzzing insects.Wang Shijing asked curiously, \u201cYunan, why didn\u2019t you recommend chrysanthemum tea to Yizhang Xuan Restaurant?\u201dShao Yunan replied, \u201cJam was recommended to Yizhang Xuan Restaurant because they were the best choice since they are the biggest the demand for ham would also be large. Zhao Lizheng family also had no other good connection so the cooperation between the two parties would naturally be pleasant. Grandpa Sun also said that he is good friends with Yongning Hall boss so he have his own connection so I also didn\u2019t intervene. Besides, Yizhang Xuan Restaurant is not my family so I am not obliged to give them every kind of business, if they have the ability they can snatch if from the Yongning Hall.\u201dWang Shijing asked: \u201cWhat about our tea and wine?\u201dShao Yunan: \u201cI have not yet thought about it, to be honest with our tea and wine the boss Xu identity he is not qualified to talk with me. It also something we need to avoid, our business initiative should be in our own hands. If everything needs to rely on a Yizhang Xuan side we will only be used by others.\u201d:\u201cOur family is not short on money now so I want to take time to find a partner. If the true owner behind Yizhang Xuan comes to em I may be cooperating with them directly. Our wine, for one liter should be no less than 50 teals of silver and not even mention tea. Even the inferior kind can be sold for not less than 200 teals of silver. While the most special one is even a thousand taels, it also only the autumn tea, if it was the spring tea, the price would be even higher. The tea that little Tang found is kind of black tea that is at least 20% more expensive than Longjing. I will not be foolish and try to find a buyer myself I will just let them beg to come to buy it from me.\u201dWang Shijing hold Shao Yunan\u2019s hand: \u201cOur tea and wine is worth so much money. Since I don\u2019t know anything about this business I will listen to you.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t work. You should follow the business since the early stage since you will need to come forward later. My physique and temperament can\u2019t subdue people. My vision of the future is that our family will own a large tea estate and winery. I will be responsible for making tea and wine while you will be responsible for talking to people about business, Qing will be responsible for studying hard and inheriting the family business in the future while Nizi is responsible for looking beautiful.\u201d\u201cHaha,\u201d Wang Shijing laughed: \u201cHow come is Nizi responsible for looking beautiful?\u201d Only his Yunan would have such strange thoughts.Shao Yunan just said: \u201cOf course a girl should dress up beautifully. As for her future marriage or something, I think there is no need to force it. While men are afraid of entering the wrong profession, women are afraid of marrying the wrong man. I also don\u2019t care if people would gossip I she can\u2019t find the right one, I would rather she didn\u2019t get married. Her little father can support her for the rest of her life.\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s breath sank a bit: \u201cAs long as she likes it, I won\u2019t force the marriage. If it really doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll find someone to marry into our family, I will not let her suffer again.\u201d\u201cWell, the most difficult one is finding someone to marry.\u201dThe four-year-old Wang Nizi did not yet know that her father and little father already considered her future marriage.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Under the supervision of Uncle Zhou and Old Father Wang, their new house was changing day by day. At the end of October, in just half a month at most, the new house would be finished. Wang Shijing went daily to observe the progress of building the new house, and spent the rest of the time with Shao Yunan and the children at home or going into the mountains.When their house was finally finished, Wang Shijing went to Zhao Lizheng to buy the mountain closest to the west of the house. Since the matter of the Sun family making the chrysanthemum tea was already out, Zhao Lizheng called a meeting of the Zhao clan and just like the Sun clan with the chrysanthemum tea, he made the jam into a Zhao clan business.At the same time, Yizhang Xuan restaurant waited for the red date and hawthorn jam and the Sun clan earned quite a bit of money together with Yongning Hall, with the sale of the chrysanthemum tea. Unfortunately the last crop of wild chrysanthemum flower blooms were already over, so the chrysanthemum tea would soon be out of stock. Boss Feng from Yongning Hall, also did not mention further distribution for now.The Sun clan\u2019s chrysanthemum tea was also made using Shao Yunan\u2019s recipe. In the final settlement, in addition to the 100 taels paid to Shao Yunan, he also earned more than 100 taels in profit. Patriarch Sun and Zhao Lizheng each put away 60 taels of silver for their own communities to buy a few acres of community clan land in the spring of the following year.In the future, the clan\u2019s production of and the profits from chrysanthemum tea and jam would be used to fund the study for the clan\u2019s children\u2026 as well as reward children for studying well. All kinds of news came in waves, making the whole village explode in gossip again. The news made the Sun and Zhao clan members overjoyed. Those who had children all went to Wang Shijing\u2019s house with gifts to thank them. If Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan weren\u2019t so generous, they didn\u2019t know if their children would ever be able to study!Tang Gengsheng, who was in the first batch of those to receive aid on the financial aid list, was brought over by his brother Tang Genshu and gave three kowtows to Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan as soon as he entered the door. The two brothers already knew from Zhao Lizheng, that it was Wang Shijing who specifically mentioned to Zhao Lizheng to give Tang Gengsheng a chance. Tang Genshu now earned enough money each month to afford Tang Gengsheng\u2019s reading lesson, so when Tang Gengsheng went to the private school with the financial support of the Zhao and Sun clans, Tang Genshu would be able to pay for Tang Gengsheng\u2019s schooling with Wang Shijing\u2019s support.The people from the two clans who did not get to participate in the business were naturally unhappy, since they were told that their character was not good enough. But with the patriarch, clan elders, and most of the clansmen at the top, they could not show their unhappiness. Since their children would also get support for private schooling, they weren\u2019t completely excluded. If the situation was not good, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get any money and would even need to pay all the tuition themselves. Of course, this support was not without a time limit, but these details were not something that Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing needed to worry about.However, while the Sun and Zhao clans were happy, the Wang clan became very depressed. Why would Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan sell the production method to the Zhao and Sun clans rather than their own clan? But it was also clear, if nothing else, Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan would not agree to deal with old lady Wang\u2019s family. Let alone Zhao Dafu\u2019s family after what they had done.This time the entire Wang clan was implicated by old lady Wang and Wang Dafu\u2019s family. Now everyone openly and secretly scolded them. Some people were even dissatisfied with Wang Wenhe, the clan patriarch. If the clan patriarch had done a better job, he would be able to suppress old lady Wang\u2019s and Wang Dafu\u2019s family. But now the Wang clan could only watch the Zhao and Sun clans eat meat, while they didn\u2019t even have a mouthful of soup to drink. Why couldn\u2019t they even have a mouthful of soup?Wang Wenhe\u2019s heart was depressed, while Wang Shuping who couldn\u2019t help was also sad. He couldn\u2019t go to Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan, since old lady Wang, who was scolded by him, became even more angry. This was her own son, but he didn\u2019t give her any ways to make money or even just money. It all went to outsiders and old lady Wang could not go out to make trouble since Wang Zhisong forbade her to go.After thinking about it, old lady Wang sent Wang Dali and Wang Chunxiu. Wang Chunxiu was unwilling, but old lady Wang said that if she could get the recipe, they would not have to worry about her dowry, making Wang Chunxiu feel very moved. Unfortunately, old lady Wang\u2019s plan was doomed to fail. As soon as Wang Dali and Wang Chunxiu stepped into the door of Wang Shijing\u2019s house, Shao Yunan said, \u201cWang Chunxiu, did you really come to seduce me?\u201dWang Chunxui howled, covered her face, and ran out of the house, while Wang Dali\u2019s face instantly turned red, not knowing if he was angry or bashful. Shao Yunan brutally drove Wang Shijing back into the house and asked Wang Dali directly, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dWithout Wang Chunxiu at the side, Wang Dali stammered and couldn\u2019t utter a single word for a half a day, so Shao Yunan fleshed a sarcastic smile. \u201cMy father, if there is a wedding, funeral, or marriage in the family, you should come. Our family will show you courtesy. But if there is not such a thing, don\u2019t come to our door. It was written in the separation deed. To be clear, yours and my mother\u2019s fingerprints are both on it.\u201d\u201cIf you are illiterate, you can ask Wang Zhisong to read it to you later. We already agreed that from now on the two families will no longer have a relationship and it\u2019s their own business whether they live well or not. How can you come to my house with your daughter, if there is nothing important? If you don\u2019t know, I might even think you want me to divorce Shijing and marry your daughter.\u201dWang Dali was too ashamed to open his mouth at this time, so he just turned around and left at an unsteady pace. Shao Yunan closed the door coldly, turned around and fell into a warm embrace. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense. When people hear it, they might think you want to divorce me and marry a woman.\u201d\u201cPfft!\u201d Shao Yunan raised his head from the man\u2019s embrace. \u201cShijing, I didn\u2019t expect you to be so open-minded. I have been with you like this, but you still think I can be like this with a woman?\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s one eye flashed. \u201cOr is it that Brother Shijing doesn\u2019t mind marrying a woman as his wife in the future?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense! I only have you as a wife!\u201d Wang Shijing got angry and bent down to carry Shao Yunan into their room, while giving him a not so gentle slap on the buttocks. Wang Qing and Wang Nizi very understandingly hid back into their own room, not wanting to disrupt their parents.The two people in the house soon undressed, not even a bit ashamed of doing stuff like this in broad daylight. They were in a very passionate mood, when someone knocked on the door. \u201cMay I ask if this is Wang Shijing\u2019s house?\u201d\u201cSomeone is looking for you.\u201d Shao Yunan pushed Wang Shijing, who was breathing heavily, and Wang Shijing\u2019s eyelids closed with impatience. \u201cWho is it!?\u201d He lifted his pants reluctantly. \u201cExcuse me, is this the home of Wang Shijing?\u201d The person knocked on the door one more time. Wang Qing came out of the room. \u201cDad, someone is looking for you.\u201d\u201cI will come out soon, open the door.\u201d Wang Qing ran over to open the courtyard door and saw an unfamiliar uncle standing outside. From the way he dressed, he was definitely not from the village, not to mention that behind the man stood a carriage.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wang Qing nodded, but didn\u2019t let him in. \u201cMy father is busy, please come back later.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m shopkeeper Xu from Yizhang Xuan restaurant. I\u2019m here to talk to your father and your little father. They are at home, Right ?\u201d\u201cYes, they are.\u201d Wang Qing turned around, hoping that his father and his little father would hurry. The closed door opened and Wang Shijing came out first. Upon seeing him, shopkeeper Xu\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cBrother Shijing.\u201d Going directly from \u201cBrother Wang\u201d to \u201cBrother Shijing\u201d.\u201cMr. Xu.\u201d Wang Qing stepped aside, while shopkeeper Xu came inside with big steps. \u201cQing, go make a cup of chrysanthemum tea.\u201d Wang Qing ran into the kitchen to make the tea, while Wang Shijing took shopkeeper Xu into Wang Qing and Wang Nizi\u2019s room saying, \u201cNizi, greet uncle Xu.\u201d\u201cGreetings uncle Xu.\u201d Wang Nizi was not as timid as before, so she greeted them as she put away the books and other things from her and her brother\u2019s table. While Wang Shijing helped her put away the pen and ink, he said, \u201cYunan will come over later.\u201d He didn\u2019t say what Shao Yunan was busy with.Shopkeeper Xu also did not ask any additional questions. He just looked around the humble house, smiled and asked, \u201cI heard that brother Shijing and little brother are building a new house, when are you moving?\u201d\u201cI think it will be the end of November.\u201d Shopkeeper Xu went to the bed, sat with his legs crossed, and looked at the charming tea set placed on top of the mahogany chest on the bed.Wang Qing came in holding a tray with two cups of chrysanthemum tea. Wang Shijing asked Wang Qing to call Shao Yunan, while he held one tea cup himself and put the other one in front of shopkeeper Xu. Then Wang Qing went out, closing the door after himself.Shopkeeper Xu picked up the white porcelain tea cup and took a sip, then he put down the cup and said, \u201cThe chrysanthemum tea in Yongning Hall is selling very well, but brother Shijing\u2019s tea still tastes better.\u201d Wang Shijing generously said, \u201cYunan likes to make these things, so he makes our chrysanthemum tea at home.\u201dAt this time, someone pushed the door and entered. Shao Yunan was neatly dressed, after using the spiritual spring water to remove the redness and swelling on his lips. After he came in, he said embarrassingly, \u201cI made Shopkeeper Xu wait for a long time.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long.\u201d Shopkeeper Xu\u2019s smile became bigger. \u201cLittle Brother Shao had something to do at home.\u201d\u201cHahaha, you are so busy that you wouldn\u2019t come to my home if you had nothing to do.\u201d Shopkeeper Xu froze for a moment before he laughed. \u201cLittle Brother Shao always says some amazing things.\u201d Shao Yunan sat on the bed and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Mr. Xu?\u201dBoss Xu stopped smiling and pointed to the tea cups in front of him. \u201cI came here for this chrysanthemum tea.\u201d\u201cAh? What\u2019s wrong with the chrysanthemum tea?\u201d Shao Yunan pretended to be confused. Of course, he was also a bit confused by shopkeeper Xu\u2019s intention. Shopkeeper Xu said, \u201cYongning Hall is not my boss\u2019s store, but now that Yongning Hall\u2019s chrysanthemum tea has been sold in Chinan Prefecture. it\u2019s hard to even get a pound. My boss is very anxious, but I know that this tea also comes from the hands of Little Brother Shao and since my boss is in the capital and it\u2019s not convenient for him to come, I came to personally meet Little Brother Shao. He also asked me to personally ask Little Brother Shao for help.\u201dShao Yunan was immediately embarrassed. \u201cShopkeeper Xu, this chrysanthemum tea is really something I didn\u2019t expect you would want. The reason I sold the production method of the ham and chrysanthemum tea to other families is because my family is too small, so it would be too hard for two people to make it in large quantities. Also my family needs to settle down in this village as fast as possible. Shopkeeper Xu also knows my family situation.\u201d\u201cShijing also wanted to help Zhao Lizheng and Patriarch Sun, so I sold the production method for the chrysanthemum tea to Patriarch Sun. They already went to Yongning Hall, because Grandpa Sun and the boss of Yongning Hall are on good terms. Since both sides have exchanged medicinal materials for a long time, it would really not be good for me to intervene.\u201dShopkeeper Xu said, \u201cI know the Sun family and Yongning Hall\u2019s boss are friends, but I don\u2019t know if it is stated in the Sun family\u2019s contract with Yongning Hall that the chrysanthemum tea can only be sold to Yongning Hall?\u201dShao Yunan shook his head. \u201cI have not asked about it. Why don\u2019t I ask Shijing to call Patriarch Sun over so you can talk face to face? If it isn\u2019t possible, we can think of another way. Since this matter is really inconvenient for me to intervene in.\u201d Shopkeeper Xu immediately said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll trouble Brother Shijing.\u201dWhile Wang Shijing went to the Sun patriarch, shopkeeper Xu asked, \u201cLittle Brother Shao, the Zhao family gathered a lot of red dates and hawthorn but have not done anything with them yet. Is there perhaps any dissatisfaction with the purchase price of our restaurant? They just need to ask, otherwise we can\u2019t know what they think.\u201dShao Yunan just smiled. \u201cBoss Xu is thinking too much. The red dates will taste sweeter and more delicious after drying for longer. Hawthorn can also be preserved for a long period of time. Since the busy farming season has just ended, Uncle Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family is just able to catch its breath. Shopkeeper Xu must also want to sell ham at a higher price, right?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Is there any fresh fruit to eat during the New Year?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d\u201cThe red dates are warming and nourishing, so a cup of red date water would be good for warming the heart in cold weather. Also if you add some ginger, women can drink it to warm their stomachs. Hawthorn is also sweet and sour, so it would make a delicious dessert in winter. Hawthorn jam can not only be eaten alone, but also made into sweet soup. If shopkeeper Xu waits a few days, he will have a gimmick to show. So the price might as well double, compared to goat milk jam and peach jam. If you take it out now to sell, you will certainly earn less, uncle Zhao Lizheng would also earn less. These things are precious, right?\u201dShopkeeper Xu listened to him with a bright gaze as he patted the table. \u201cLittle Brother Shao, you not going into a business is really a big loss.\u201d Shao Yunan smilingly said, \u201cIf I don\u2019t go into business, shopkeeper Xu will have one less competitor, right? Since I have such a good friendship with shopkeeper Xu, it\u2019s a pity to become a rival. So I will just keep to my land and mountain.\u201d\u201cLittle Brother Shao is really modest.\u201d Shopkeeper Xu laughed, learning a bit more about Shao Yunan\u2019s heart. It seemed that he still thought of this person too simply. Shao Yunan restrained his smile and said, \u201cThis little brother also has something that he wants to tell Shopkeeper Xu. My Shijing has two relatives, both of whom are very nice people. Since it is already the end of the busy farming season, they also want to do some small business to earn some money. I would like to ask if they can set up a small stall in front of Yizhang Xuan restaurant with some rare snacks, which will also attract customers to Yizhang Xuan restaurant.\u201d Shopkeeper Xu asked, \u201cWhat kind of snacks would it be?\u201d\u201cBoss Xu must not have eaten it before. When it\u2019s ready, I will ask them to send some to Yizhang Xuan restaurant.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. No matter if it\u2019s rare or not, if Little Brother Shao asks, I will trust you. There is no need to set up a stall at the entrance, just set up in my Yizhang Xuan restaurant, paying a small rent every month, but not more than one silver.\u201dShao Yunan laughed. \u201cRent and other things can be discussed later. If you think it\u2019s good, we can work together. Brother Shijing\u2019s two relatives are from the Wang clan, so if I didn\u2019t want them to be able to do this business alone, I wouldn\u2019t bother shopkeeper Xu. If you think the taste is good, I will give you the recipe so you can add it to Yizhang Xuan\u2019s restaurant menu.\u201dShopkeeper Xu was overjoyed. \u201cLittle Brother Shao, if I didn\u2019t come today, I wonder if I would have figured out what you are capable of. If it\u2019s really good, I don\u2019t want to be given this recipe, I will buy it.\u201dShao Yunan waved his hand indifferently. \u201cIf I think of a way to make money, I will be exhausted to death. I like to earn money, but I also need to learn to enjoy life. People should not be slaves to money. I don\u2019t need to sell dish recipes to make money, so I might as well give you a few for the sake of our friendship. So if I have trouble with you in the future, will it be possible that you will still collect money from me?\u201d\u201cHahaha, Little Brother Shao is really righteous! Not being a slave to money! Only Little Brother Shao can say such a thing.\u201d Shopkeeper Xu was very happy in his heart, regardless of whether the chrysanthemum tea matter could be negotiated depended on his personal ability, but these dish recipes for sure would be worth a lot of money, so he did not come in vain. Shopkeeper Xu also became even more determined to make friends with Shao Yunan. He appreciated Shao Yunan more and more, and would certainly inform his big boss of this matter.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had already gotten to the bottom of the matter with Patriarch Sun, so as soon as Patriarch Sun entered the room, shopkeeper Xu got off the kang and greeted him with a kind attitude. When the two sides sat down, Patriarch Sun said, \u201cShijing told me what Manager Xu had entrusted to him, so I will not hide. My Sun family and Yongning Hall\u2019s contract indeed says that the chrysanthemum tea can only be sold to Yongning Hall. Since my uncle and the owner of Yongning Hall are good friends, this matter is really difficult.\u201dShopkeeper Xu sighed, \u201cI embarrassed Patriarch Sun.\u201d Patriarch Sun said, \u201cShopkeeper Xu, why don\u2019t you buy from Shijing and Yunan? The contract between my Sun family and Yongning Hall is only limited to us but it has nothing to do with Shijing and Yunan. The contract my brother signed only said that as long as it does not affect the business of our family Yunan can still sell chrysanthemum tea to others. Also chrysanthemum tea made by Yunan is better than the one we make at home.\u201dShopkeeper Xu\u2019s hopes were immediately raised again as he looked at Shao Yunan. Shao Yunan only said helplessly, \u201cBoss Xu, Shijing and I have no energy to spare for this business. If I sold chrysanthemum tea, it would be at most two kilos at a time. Would that be enough?\u201dShopkeeper Xu became distressed. \u201cTwo kilos is certainly not enough. I can also guarantee that this chrysanthemum tea would not be sold in Yongxiu province. Since my boss is from the capital, we want to try selling it in the capital. I don\u2019t want to argue with Yongning Hall, but I don\u2019t believe that they will be able to sell the chrysanthemum tea in the capital.\u201dHearing this, Patriarch Sun said, \u201cYunan you should talk with shopkeeper Xu. I\u2019ll go back first. Shopkeeper Xu also has a point. With the amount of tea produced by the Sun clan, the farthest Yongning Hall can sell the tea is Chinan Province. So you and Shijing should think about it carefully. You shouldn\u2019t give up money you can make.\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll give it some thought and not let Patriarch Sun worry about it.\u201d Patriarch Sun got off the kang bed and put on his shoes. While Wang Shijing sent him out, shopkeeper Xu looked at Shao Yunan pitifully. Shao Yunan had a headache. He had something that could make a lot of money, so why should he bother with something like chrysanthemum tea? However, he has no plans to expose Longjing tea for now.\u201cLittle Brother Shao, please help me.\u201d Shopkeeper Xu was very moved by\u00a0 Patriarch Sun\u2019s words. No matter what, he had to get the chrysanthemum tea today. Shao Yunan rubbed his forehead. \u201cShopkeeper Xu, my family does not plant chrysanthemums on its land, but there are still some chrysanthemums in the mountains on the west of the village. There aren\u2019t many of them. The rest were already taken by Patriarch Sun\u2019s family. I don\u2019t have the manpower, energy, or materials, so you\u2019re making it difficult for me.\u201d\u201cLittle Brother Shao, think of something. I am willing to pay 10 taels of silver for a kilo.\u201d Shao Yunan smiled. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of losing money?\u201d Shopkeeper Xu just smiled mysteriously. \u201cIf you take this thing to the capital, you can only earn more money. It will never be a loss.\u201dShao Yunan sighed. Not because he was moved, but because he was really too lazy to do this business. But with shopkeeper Xu\u2019s attitude, if he didn\u2019t give him the chrysanthemum tea, he wouldn\u2019t leave. He thought about it for a moment and finally said, \u201cShopkeeper Xu, why don\u2019t we just take the high-end route?\u201d\u201cWhat is the high-end route?\u201d Wang Shijing came in and quietly sat next to Shao Yunan and listened to his next words. \u201cI make chrysanthemum tea purely for my hobby, mainly for my house\u2019s needs. It\u2019s for family to drink or to send to friends, so I could only give you up to 50 kilos of chrysanthemum tea a year.\u201d\u201cHowever, I can guarantee that the chrysanthemum tea I give you would be absolutely unique in terms of taste and appearance. Because of this, shopkeeper Xu should sell this chrysanthemum tea as a flower tea and not as a medicine. As a flower tea you only need to pay attention to its packaging and content. Adding its unique appearance and taste, not to mention whether you have money you would also need to have status to have the luck to buy it.\u201dShopkeeper Xu\u2019s heart beat a little faster. \u201cWait a minute, Shopkeeper Xu.\u201d Shao Yunan got out of bed and went out of the room. Shopkeeper Xu, who saw him leave, turned his head after him. Then he said to the expressionless Wang Shijing, who sat on the opposite side. \u201cBrother Shijing really married a capable wife!\u201dThe corner of Wang Shijing\u2019s mouth immediately raised. \u201cMy wife is really capable.\u201d Meanwhile Shao Yuanan returned to his own room and locked the door before entering his space. From his collection, he dug out a pure wooden box containing tea leaves, then he dug out another box containing wolfberry and added it to the first wooden box. Then he also added a few red dates, before finding a white porcelain jar from his large collection of tea leaves. After checking it, he left the space.Holding the box and a jar, Shao Yunan returned to the next room. Sitting down on the kang, he said, \u201cShijing, bring some more chrysanthemum tea.\u201dWang Shijing went to get the chrysanthemum tea, while shopkeeper Xu looked greedily at Wang Shijing pouring out some golden dried chrysanthemums from the tea pot by the window and almost couldn\u2019t stop himself from grabbing them.Shao Yunan opened the wooden box and poured the wolfberry and red dates on the table. Then taking out two dried chrysanthemums, he shaped them before placing them together with a few wolfberries and two red dates beside them. The red dates he chose were small golden dates so they would not take over the taste. Meanwhile, shopkeeper Xu and Wang Shijing\u2019s expressions were curious, not knowing what would happen next.Edited by: JaislandProofreader:Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After he finished setting it up, Shao Yunan turned to shopkeeper Xu with the wooden box.\u201cHow about checking out the chrysanthemum tea in this box?\u201d Shopkeeper Xu looked at it with starry eyes. \u201cVery beautiful! Much more pleasing to the eye than that handful of chrysanthemum tea.\u201d\u201cThese are Chrysanthemum, wolfberry, and red dates that are \u2018carefully selected\u2019, so they are good materials. After mixing them with the Chrysanthemum, the wolfberry and red dates would stop the slightly bitter taste with a sweet taste. Also, putting it so neatly together in a wooden box also has another effect besides extraordinary taste. Shopkeeper Xu, how much do you think a box of such healthy tea should cost?\u201d Shopkeeper Xu\u2019s eyes become round. \u201cWonderful, wonderful!\u201d\u201cSince the proprietor of the restaurant has a background in the capital, why not make more use of it? The most important people in the capital are officials, while the most important thing for the officials is money. Do you think they would like this high-end and elegant chrysanthemum tea box, or would they prefer a bigger quantity of chrysanthemum tea from the pharmacy?\u201d\u201cNaturally it is the former!\u201d\u201cThe items placed with the chrysanthemum tea can also be varied. So\u00a0 shopkeeper Xu should ask a doctor how it should be changed. As long as the medicinal properties complement each other and the effect is mild it will be good. The chrysanthemum tea I gave to shopkeeper Xu is also special and the chrysanthemums are much bigger than normal, which gives a better appearance of the flower.\u201d\u201cEveryone can drink a cup of chrysanthemum tea, but this golden silk imperial chrysanthemum is different and has a different price. It also should not be mixed with other things. Anyway it\u2019s necessary to look for the upper class to sell it to and make them feel that only such a chrysanthemum tea can be worthy of their status. What shopkeeper Xu should do is to promote the limited chrysanthemum tea in his hand as high end as possible and take the upper class route.\u201d\u201cWonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful!\u201d Shopkeeper Xu could repeat himself in wonder. \u201cShijin, I will now make a cup of this high-end chrysanthemum tea for Shopkeeper Xu.\u201d Wang Shijing went to bring some hot water.Shao Yunan took two white porcelain tea cups again, while Wang Shijing returned with a pot of hot water. Shao Yunan put a portion of chrysanthemum, wolfberry, and red dates into the tea bowl before pouring in some hot water. As the dried chrysanthemum slowly unfolded, shopkeeper Xu\u2019s breath slowly caught.\u201cBeautiful! Beautiful!\u201d\u201cThis is not even the prettiest one yet.\u201dShao Yunan smiled mysteriously, picked up the white porcelain tea jar he just carried in, and took out a dried chrysanthemum flower from inside. As soon as he saw the chrysanthemum, Wang Shijing\u2019s one eye quickly flashed a hint of doubt. This dried chrysanthemum was very large, but Shao Yunan put it into another tea cup and poured some water. When the dried chrysanthemum spread out, shopkeeper Xu exclaimed, \u201cThis is it!\u201dWang Shijing restrained his face. He was also very surprised. Shao Yunan glanced at Wang Shijing and said with a smile, \u201cThis is a wild chrysanthemum carefully selected by Shijing and I. It\u2019s of a different variety. The main difference is that this wild chrysanthemum is large and has a different flower compared to other wild chrysanthemums. Shopkeeper Xu, as you can see, as long as you pour water on it, its petals extend like a golden sun. Shopkeeper Xu should try these two cups of chrysanthemum tea again.\u201dShopkeeper Xu\u2019s hands trembled a little, what was in front of him was not chrysanthemum tea, but pure money! After tasting two kinds of chrysanthemum tea, shopkeeper Xu\u2019s voice trembled. \u201cLittle Brother Shao, just be merciful and sell them all to me.\u201d\u201cHaha.\u201d Shao Yunan put the jar of chrysanthemum tea away. \u201cI only have two jars of it, so I can only give one jar to shopkeeper Xu for now. But it can\u2019t be bought by the kilo.\u201d\u201cNaturally, how about three taels of silver for one flower? As for the small flower 5 silver a kilo. While the idea that Little Brother Shao came up with is worth at least another 200 taels of silver.\u201dShao Yunan said, \u201cThis \u2018Golden Silk Chrysanthemum\u2019 is really rare and I didn\u2019t intend to sell it. So I will not be modest with my price. The price of 3 taels of silver for one flower is very ordinary. But shopkeeper Xu doesn\u2019t need to accept the price of 5 taels of silver per kilo. Patriarch Sun only sells it for 3 taels of silver per kilo, so shopkeeper Xu accepts this price. As for the idea, shopkeeper Xu should only pay for it after it succeeds.\u201d\u201cFor sure!\u201d Shopkeeper Xu became excited. \u201cThis \u2018golden silk royal chrysanthemum,\u2019 how much can Little Brother Shao supply in a year?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to say, Shijing and I need to try planting some, so in the future when I produce good golden chrysanthemum, at least fifty percent of the supply would go to shopkeeper Xu. I want to keep some for myself and to give others as gifts.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d\u201cI guarantee 50 kilo for ordinary chrysanthemum tea.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201dThe two of them didn\u2019t write a deed for this transaction, because Shao Yunan was not able to provide much. To sell at a high price, they had to rely on shopkeeper Xu\u2019s big boss\u2019s operation in the capital. Anyway, the focus was on the high-end crowd. There were also 103 golden chrysanthemums in Shao Yunan\u2019s jar, which added to a total of 309 taels of silver. Shopkeeper Xu directly gave him 310 taels. As for ordinary chrysanthemum tea, Shao Yunan could only give 40 kilos, which added another 120 taels of silver. Shopkeeper Xu also added the idea fee, which added up to 630 taels of silver.Shao Yunan thought that shopkeeper Xu would need to go to town to get the money, but to his surprise he directly took a box from the carriage with 630 silver ingots.Shao Yunan did not intend to rely on the chrysanthemum tea to earn money, but he still easily earned 630 taels of silver. At noon, shopkeeper Xu, who stayed for a meal, ate the mapo tofu prepared by Shao Yunan, together with sliced boiled pork, shredded potatoes in vinegar (the two children\u2019s favorite), fish eggplant, and pork balls with radish soup.Shopkeeper Xu sat at the dining table observing the dishes, while doubting his identity as the shopkeeper of Yizhang Xuan. Yizhang Xuan was a restaurant, but he had never eaten such dishes before! Shopkeeper Xu looked at Shao Yunan and wished to steal him and take him away. Shao Yunan also did not talk much, letting Wang Shijing pick up the chopsticks.\u201cLet\u2019s eat!\u201d Wang Qing and Nizi reached out their chopsticks towards the shredded potatoes first. Then they tried the uneaten, yet boiled pork and mabo tofu. Chili pepper was a necessary thing for people living in cold areas of the great state of Yan. Yongxiu province was between the north and the south, so their tastes were mixed. Wang Shijing\u00a0 fought for three years in a cold land in the north, so he favored spicy dishes. While shopkeeper Xu moved his chopstick non stop, Wang Shijing also buried his head and ate. The two children were so happy that they wanted to cry. The food prepared by their little father was really delicious!Finally everything was eaten, including the pot of pork balls and radish soup. Shopkeeper Xu let out a burp in embarrassment, but Shao Yunan just smiled and said, \u201cWhich dish did Mr. Xu like? I\u2019ll write the recipe for you.\u201d Shopkeeper Xu said embarrassingly, \u201cI liked it all.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d As expected, shopkeeper Xu asked for the recipes for all five dishes, so Shao Yunan gave them to him. While shopkeeper Xu said nothing, he just strongly asked Shao Yunan to sign a contract with him. He could no longer give these recipes to others and he would pay 500 taels of silver for them. Shao Yunan signed a contract with him, but only for 100 taels of silver, shredded potatoes in vinegar and pork balls with radish soup would be completely non-technical, so he considered it a free gift. The shopkeeper Xu did not refuse and just took out a suet jade pendant on his waist and gave it to Wang Qing, while Shao Yunan let Wang Qing accept it.Shopkeeper Xu left after bringing a large amount of money-making business to his boss. Shopkeeper Xu had a hunch that in the future, his boss might need to rely on this mysterious Little Brother Shao to become the richest businessman in the great state of Yan. Shopkeeper Xu, still didn\u2019t know that in the future, there might be another powerful person who would compete with his boss for the title of the number one merchant in the great state of Yan.Shopkeeper Xu left contentedly, while two husbands went back to rest after cleaning up after the meal. As soon as their door closed, Shao Yunan asked, \u201cShijing, why don\u2019t you ask?\u201d The jar of golden silk chrysanthemum and wooden box had never appeared in their house before. Even the wolfberries and golden red dates had never been found in their house before.\u201cI won\u2019t ask.\u201d Wang Shijing said in a muffled voice as he hugged Shao Yunan. Shao Yunan asked again, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know?\u201d\u201cYes, but I won\u2019t ask you until you are willing to tell me.\u201d\u201cThen what if I refuse to tell you?\u201d\u201cThen I still won\u2019t ask.\u201d Wang Shijing said, his voice becoming duller. \u201cWhether you tell me or not, you are my wife.\u201d How could this person not want to know? But not wanting to force it, Shao Yunan rubbed Wang Shijing\u2019s chest and hugged his waist. \u201cGive me some more time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d\u201cShijing, do you like me?\u201d Shao Yunan raised his head. Wang Shijing\u2019s jaw muscles tightened for a moment and he pressed Shao Yunan\u2019s head back to his chest, preventing him from seeing his expression. \u201cI like you. But if you are my match\u2026\u201d His next words were stopped by Shao Yunan\u2019s hand.\u201cDon\u2019t say such things in the future, whether you are worthy or not. I don\u2019t want to have children, since I hate to have the appearance of a big belly and bear the pain of having children. It\u2019s better that you already have children, since I have this baggage\u2026 you gave me absolute freedom. If it was someone else, my wishes might have been dismissed long ago. I also don\u2019t like women by nature, so it\u2019s just right for me to get married. In this way you and I are a very good match.\u201dWang Shijing lowered his head, his lips landing on Shao Yunan\u2019s forehead, while the muscles in his whole body tensed. \u201cGive me some more time. I promise you, it won\u2019t take long.\u201d\u201cHmmm.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m actually glad Wang Zhisong backed out of the marriage and let you marry me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention him! You are supposed to be mine.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026 if one day your ex-wife comes back to you, what will you do?\u201d\u201cI have already divorced her. I can\u2019t live with her and she can\u2019t live with me either. When she abandoned Wang Qing and Wang Nizi, she also took all the money I left with her. She didn\u2019t leave anything to Wang Qing and Wang Nizi at all. She and I are already done.\u201d After a pause he added, \u201cI like you.\u201d\u201cIf you dare to show affection to anyone else in the future, I will definitely cut off your five taels of meat and make wine from it. It\u2019s no joke.\u201d Wang Shijing only felt pain in that place. \u201cI won\u2019t give you this opportunity.\u201d\u201cWell, since there is money, go to Zhao Lizheng house and buy the mountain.\u201d\u201cI am going.\u201dEdited by: JaislandProofreader:Support translation:Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Therefore, it wasn\u2019t that simple to take out too much at one time. Besides, it was only natural to keep the good stuff for your own enjoyment. He had golden chrysanthemum seeds, so when he tells Wang Shijing about his space, all the seeds would be planted. Since several acres of his land in the space became \u2018barren.\u2019 Shao Yunan became very distressed, which also made it necessary to tell Wang Shijing about the space.But since he already showed the chrysanthemum tea to shopkeeper Xu, he should also give some tea to County Magistrate Jiang and Dean Cen. Otherwise, they would get news from Yizhang Xuan and get their own ideas. Yongning Hall\u2019s chrysanthemum tea was provided by the Sun family, but the one from Yizhang Xuan restaurant was provided by him.The day after shopkeeper Xu\u2019s visit, Shao Yunan picked some chrysanthemum tea at home and selected the best quality for County Magistrate Jiang, Dean Cen, and teachers Guan and Cen. He also wanted to give shopkeeper Zeng some to taste. Shao Yunan wanted to send Wang Qing to White Moon Academy, so he was bound to curry favor with Dean Cen. Wang Shijing went to the new house to tell Uncle Zhou and Father Wang that they had to go to the county town, so they were waiting for him to return.As the carriage drove into Xiushui Village, the villagers who had finished farming saw that the drivers were two strong and powerful men. The carriage also looked like it belonged to a large family, so many villagers speculated where it was going after they saw it. Then the driver stopped and asked the villagers nearby, \u201cMay I ask how I can get to Wang Shijing\u2019s house?\u201dThey were looking for Wang Shijing? Immediately a villager said, \u201cGo down the road and turn north at the last intersection. It\u2019s the one with the shortest courtyard wall.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d The carriage driver drove away. After the carriage left, the villagers gathered together and talked about it. \u201cThey come to look for Shijing?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t someone just come to their house in a carriage yesterday? Is it the same person?\u201d\u201cNo, the carriage is different. I heard the person who came yesterday was the shopkeeper from Yizhang Xuan restaurant. When he left, he took something with him, so he must have done some business with their family again.\u201d\u201cThis Shijing married the right male wife. Just look at how prosperous his family\u2019s life has become.\u201d\u201cNot to mention his family\u2019s life, his old family almost got wiped out.\u201d\u201cHaha, old lady Wang\u2019s family is probably so regretful that they turned blue.\u201d\u201cNot to mention old lady Wang\u2019s family, Patriarch Wang must also be regretful. Look at that child student from old lady Wang\u2019s family, he has been back to the village for so long, but he never even once went to Patriarch Wang\u2019s house. But when it comes to money, he still covets it. He really has no shame.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I can already foresee that this boy won\u2019t be able to pass the examination in the future. This boy is already famous in the county town. I went to the county town a few days ago to buy clothes. When the shopkeeper heard that I am from Xiushui village, he asked me if I knew a child student named Wang Zhisong. I became so panicked at that time.\u201d\u201cHe deserved it. No one expected that he would be so cruel in private. A child as young as Wang Qing just touched his books, but he was punished with kneeling overnight. If I were Shijing, I would have beaten him up.\u201dThe gossip about Wang Shijing was transferred to Wang Zhisong. Many people in the village made money so they went to the county town more often. The story of Wang Zhisong was spread through the county school. The students of the county school had all kinds of identities, so it wasn\u2019t strange that something that was discussed in private was also a well well-known secret? Only Wang Zhisong, who didn\u2019t go outside, didn\u2019t know that he had become famous. So, he still wanted to rent a house in the county town to stay away from the village gossip, while waiting for the exam the following year.The driver easily found the house with the shortest courtyard wall and parked the carriage on the side of the road. Then the big man next to the driver jumped down and lifted the curtain, \u201cLord, it\u2019s here.\u201d The person in the carriage looked out and with the help of the big man\u2019s arm, got off the carriage and said, \u201cGo knock on the door.\u201dThe big man went to knock on the door and a moment later, a child\u2019s voice from from inside. \u201cComing, who is it?\u201d\u201cExcuse me, this is Wang Shijing\u2019s house, right?\u201d Because of Shao Yunan\u2019s status as a male wife, no one who came could say that they were looking for him (even though they actually came to meet him). \u201cYes.\u201d With that, the door was opened by a small boy. The adult man then stepped forward and asked, \u201cAre your father and little father at home?\u201dWang Qing stared blankly at this young uncle with extraordinary temperament and nodded subconsciously, \u201cMy little father is here but my father is out.\u201d At this time, Shao Yunan came out of the room. \u201cWho is it?\u201d As he looked up he was stunned. \u201cLord\u2026\u201d The other party\u2019s gesture made him swallow the \u2018Lord Jiang.\u2019Jiang Kangning walked in and gestured to the big man to close the door behind him and not follow him inside. Shao Yunan blinked. \u201cLord, should I just say that you read my thoughts? I was just about to go to see you.\u201d The other side froze and then laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have such a heart to heart connection. You also didn\u2019t need to come to the county town to see me, since this official himself came.\u201dWang Qing\u2019s body trembled, so Shao Yunan pulled him over. \u201cWang Qing, greet the lord.\u201d\u201cMy lord!\u201d Wang Qing hurriedly saluted, then Wang Nizi also came out. Shao Yunan pulled Wang Nizi and also asked her to greet the lord. Both children were very nervous facing the\u00a0 official.\u201cQing, you and Nizi should go and ask your father to come back quickly, since such an honored guest came. Your father went to the new house.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Wang Qing took his sister\u2019s hand and ran away nervously, while Shao Yunan guided Jiang Kangning into the house.Jiang Kangning jokingly said as he followed him inside, \u201cThis official heard that gentleman Shao has been making a lot of money recently. Not only did he buy a large piece of land for his new house, he also bought thirty acres of land and a mountain. This magistrate was told yesterday that you are becoming one of the richest families in Xiushui Village.\u201d\u201cHaha. It was an accident. I didn\u2019t expect this money to be so easy to earn.\u201d Jiang Kangning pointed at Shao Yunan with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you so shameless and thick-skinned. When you say money can be so easily earned, it is almost as if you are looking for a fight.\u201cHehe.\u201d Shao Yunan asked Magistrate Jiang to sit down on the kang bed and said, \u201cSit down for a while, I will make some tea for you.\u201d\u201cChrysanthemum tea?\u201d Magistrate Jiang\u2019s inquiry carried a bit of a peculiar endnote. Shao Yunan blinked his eyes as if he wondered if \u2018he should ask for punishment.\u2019 Then he blinked again and said, \u201cHow could ordinary chrysanthemum tea be worthy of your status as County Magistrate? I will make you a chrysanthemum tea of three taels of silver a piece.\u201dCounty Magistrate Jiang became surprised for a moment, as Shao Yunan went out with a puppy look. Once he left, County Magistrate Jiang stopped smiling and let out a long breath. After a moment Shao Yunan came back with boiled water. Originally, he had planned to go to the county town, so he didn\u2019t boil any water. He also didn\u2019t know how to start the stove at home, so he used the tea stove he used to make Longjing tea, to boil the water needed for the golden silk chrysanthemum tea for County Magistrate Jiang.When Shao Yunan put the tea cup in front of him, County Magistrate Jiang exclaimed, \u201cThis is chrysanthemum tea?\u201d\u201cYes. But it\u2019s not the same kind as the one sold by Yongning Hall. This is a different variety of chrysanthemum that Shijing and I accidentally discovered. I call it \u2018Golden Silk Chrysanthemum,\u2019 but the quantity is very small, so I could only sell a hundred of them to the shopkeeper Xu from Yizhang Xuan restaurant. I also kept some for myself, because I planned to bring it to Lord today.\u201dCounty Magistrate Jiang raised his cup with the chrysanthemum tea. So\u2026 it was different from Yongning Hall\u2019s chrysanthemum tea. He also had some understanding of the chrysanthemum tea\u2019s origin. Therefore, Shao Yunan didn\u2019t need to hide his cooperation with Yizhang Xuan restaurant.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s much better than the one sold at Yongning Hall and also looks several times better. The name \u2018Golden silk chrysanthemum\u2019 is really appropriate. It\u2019s also more than enough to make tribute tea.\u201dShao Yunan could not pretend to not understand County Magistrate Jiang\u2019s meaning, so he said, \u201cShijing and I picked everything that can be picked from the mountain and it will be winter soon. Even if we plant some at home, it would be too late. We can only wait until next spring to plant some and see if we can still produce such large flowers.\u201dCounty Magistrate Jiang took another sip and stared thoughtfully at the bright yellow Golden Silk Emperor Chrysanthemum. Suddenly a strong knock could be heard from the door outside.\u201cBang bang bang!\u201d\u201cSister-in-law! Sister-in-law, come out soon! Brother Qing had an accident!\u201dInside the house, Shao Yunan ran out with a jolt, no longer caring about County Magistrate Jiang inside. When he opened the door, Shao Yunan\u2019s expression changed to horror. \u201cWhat happened to Qing?\u201dThe person who came was Wang Xing, who was about to cry. \u201cQing was pushed into the river by Wang Zaizheng. He was no longer breathing after he was rescued. Shijing who was just passing by is by the river, quickly come and see!\u201d Shao Yunan\u2019s head buzzed, but in the next second he pushed Wang Zing away and ran toward the river.\u201cI\u2019ll go and have a look!\u201d County Magistrate Jiang said to his two subordinates with a serious expression and also hurried over.There was no particular need to search, since it was the place where most of the villagers nearby gathered after the incident happened. Even from a distance, Shao Yunan could hear someone crying while someone else shouted, \u201cYunan is coming, Yunan is coming.\u201d\u201cYunan\u2026\u201d Fourth aunt Wang cried as she came out of the crowd.The crowd automatically moved aside and then Shao Yunan saw Wang Qing lying motionlessly and lifelessly on the ground, with Wang Nizi lying on top of him and crying.\u201cGet out of the way! Don\u2019t gather there!\u201d Shao Yunan rushed over and pulled Wang Nizi up, before pushing her into fourth aunt Wang\u2019s arms. His voice trembled as he asked, \u201cHow long has it been since Wang Qing was rescued?\u201dWang Nizi cried, \u201cLittle father! Save brother! Save my brother!\u201d\u201cHow long since he was rescued!\u201d Shao Yunan peeled off Wang Qing\u2019s clothes, his voice changing. Someone finally replied, \u201cIt\u2019s been less than a cup of tea.\u201d That means less than five minutes! \u201cGet out of the way! Don\u2019t crowd around!\u201dShao Yunan yelled at the onlooking villagers that quickly took several steps backwards. Then Shao Yunan raised Wang Qing\u2019s chin and pressed his chest with both hands as he sent air into his opened mouth, shocking everyone around. Even Wang Nizi forgot to cry as she watched her little father do such a strange thing to her brother. \u201cBrother Qing, breathe, breathe. You can\u2019t give up! You can\u2019t give up!\u201dShao Yunan gave Wang Qing artificial respiration while calling him to consciousness.\u201cWhat is Shijing\u2019s wife doing?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dCounty Magistrate Jiang who followed after Shao Yuanan also paid attention to his actions as he heard another roar. \u201cQing!\u201dWang Nizi turned around and started crying again as she rushed over. \u201cFather!\u201dWang Shijing was about to pick up Wang Nizi just like in the past, but was stopped by fourth aunt Wang. \u201cShijing, don\u2019t go there. Yunan told us to back away, so he might have a way to save little Qing.\u201dShao Yunan had no time to care about Wang Shijing, for he wanted to snatch someone from the god of death. Wang Nizi only cried as she complained, \u201cDad, Wang Zaizheng pushed my brother into the water. He said that my brother and I should die, and that grandma and second aunt should have sold us earlier. Wuwu Wuwu\u2026 Dad\u2026\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s one-eye turned red as he shoved Wang Nizi into Wang Zhuanghua\u2019s arms, who was going to talk to him. Then he ran towards his family\u2019s house.\u201cHurry up and stop Shijing, I am afraid he went crazy! Don\u2019t let something happen again!\u201d Fourth aunt Wang hurriedly shouted to several nearby young men. Then Wang Zhuanghua handed Wang Nizi, who was still crying so hard that she was almost out of breath over to her and together with Wang Xing and brother Sun rushed after Shijing. Several other young men also chased after them.Jiang Kangning frowned and whispered to the people around him, \u201cYou also go over there.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShao Yunan was still giving first aid to Wang Qing, when someone who couldn\u2019t bear watching it anymore said, \u201cShijing\u2019s wife, stop torturing this child more. Just let him go.\u201d Shao Yunan just ignored it.\u201cYunan\u2026\u201d Fourth Aunt Wang also felt hopeless, as her tears fell.\u201c15, 16, 17, 18\u2026\u201dA mouthful of air was put into Wang Qing\u2019s mouth and Shao Yunan continued to do lung compression. Meanwhile, the mad Wang Shijing kicked open the front door of the big house with one kick. While ignoring the screams of old lady Wang and Wang Chunxiu, he rushed into the house like a bull. Then he found Wang Zaizheng hiding under the table and brought him out.\u201cWang Shijing! You son of a bitch! Do you want to kill your mother?!\u201d Old lady Wang\u2019s screams were stopped by Wang Shijing\u2019s blood-shot eyes. Then Wang Shijing took off his blindfold, with his face distorted with extreme anger making old lady Wang so frightened that she almost wet herself. Wang Chunxiu also screamed and hid, while Wang Zhisong who had come out of the house and saw this scene immediately hid back into the house.\u201cGrandma, grandma save me! Grandma!\u201dWang Zaizheng\u2019s trousers became wet. He never thought that this terrible uncle would come directly to catch him. Wang Shijing carried Wang Zaizheng out of the house and roared, \u201cI want you to pay for Qing\u2019s life!\u201d\u201cGrandma! Little Uncle! Little Uncle, save me! Little Uncle, help! Little Uncle, save me! \u201c\u201cI want you to pay for Qing\u2019s life!\u201d\u201cBrother Shijing, calm down!\u201d Wang Xing, who, together with Wang Zhuanghua and Sun brothers, had finally caught up, said. Together with a few other people, they tried to stop the furious Wang Shijing. Wang Zaizheng was frightened by everything that was happening around him while Wang Dali shrank on the side. Wang Zhisong was also too afraid to come out. Wang Shijing brutally waved away his good brothers who tried to block him and finally carried Wang Zaizheng out of the big house.\u201cBrother Shijing! Calm down!\u201d\u201cGo and call the head of the village, Zhao Lizheng! Call the clan patriarch!\u201d\u201cShijing!\u201d\u201cLittle Uncle! Grandma! Uncle! Grandma!\u201dWang Shijing had only one thought in his head, that was to make Wang Zaizheng pay for his son\u2019s life. But more and more people appeared to stop him, while Zhao Lizheng also rushed over quickly, saying to Wang Shijing, \u201cShao Yunan is still trying to save Wang Qing\u2019s life. If you kill Wang Zaizheng now, you will become unreasonable even if you are justified. Uncle Zhao promises you that no matter how your clan patriarch deals with this matter, uncle Zhao will try to give you justice.\u201d\u201cShijing, put down Wang Zaizheng. You will go to jail if you kill him! Calm down! Shao Yunan is still trying to save little Qing.\u201d The two Sun brothers, Zhao Yuande and Zhao Yuanqing, pulled Wang Zaizheng away, who was so frightened that he started to smell like feces and urine.Wang Shijing\u2019s one eye glowed red as he shouted in a thick voice, \u201cLittle Qing better be well otherwise you will pay for it with your own life! I want him to pay for it with his own life!\u201d Zhao Lizheng said, \u201cI promise to give you and little Qing justice. Go to Yunan first, maybe he has a way.\u201dWang Xing and Wang Zhuanghua who received Zhao Lizheng\u2019s signal dragged Wang Shijing over. Wang Shijing\u2019s breathing was so heavy that it seemed he would suffocate at any moment.Zhao Yuanqing took the frightened Wang Zaizheng away, while Zhao Lizheng together with his eldest son joined everyone by the river. Shao Yunan was still giving Wang Qing artificial respiration, while many onlookers urged him to give up and stop torturing Wang Qing. Wang Nizi had already cried so much that she didn\u2019t have any tears left.Just at that moment\u2026\u201cCough cough\u2026\u201d\u201cCough cough\u2026\u201dThe surroundings suddenly became quiet as they stared at Wang Qing, who suddenly made a sound, in disbelief, wondering if there was something wrong with their ears. But then Wang Qing coughed again and spat out several mouthfuls of water, making everyone jerk back. Shao Yunan\u2019s trembling heart finally calmed down as his hands went limp and he picked up Wang Qing, his eyes full of tears.\u201cOkay, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Shao Yun\u2019an gave Wang Qing\u2019s head a few kisses. He was still scared out of his mind.\u201cLittle Qing is alive!\u201d He didn\u2019t know who shouted it, but in an instant, the crowd boiled.Wang Nizi stared blankly at her brother who was coughing in her little father\u2019s arms and suddenly screamed, \u201cBrother!\u201d She struggled to get out of fourth aunt Wang\u2019s arms and then rushed over. \u201cBrother! Woo\u2026 Little Father\u2026 Brother\u2026\u201dWang Qing was still coughing as Shao Yunan untied his clothes with one hand. Then someone came over and wrapped an outer garment around Wang Qing\u2019s body, it was Tang Genshu.\u201cThank you.\u201dShao Yunan tried to stand up with Wang Qing in his arms. But his legs were still as soft as noodles. \u201cShijing! Come here quickly! Brother Qing is alive! Yunan has brought Qing back to life!\u201dTo the despairing Wang Shijing, this voice sounded almost like heavenly music. After pausing for a moment, he rushed over. Seeing his son coughing in Shao Yunan\u2019s arms, he ran over and knelt down on the ground, hugging the most important people in his life tightly in his arms.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My legs are still weak. Quickly give him a cup of warm water and ginger soup. Then ask Grandpa Sun to come over and give him a look. I need to sit down for a bit.\u201dAfter kissing Shao Yunan on the head, Wang Shijing picked up Wang Qing and Wang Nizi with both hands and went home, while fourth aunt Wang tried to help Shao Yunan. But Shao Yunan just shook his head saying, \u201cI\u2019m afraid, I still can\u2019t stand up. Give me a moment.\u201d\u201cRest for a while, I\u2019ll go over.\u201d Fourth aunt Wang ignored Shao Yunan for the time being and beckoned Aunt Zhou and the others to go after Wang Shijing. At times like this, someone should help them.Then another person came over to help Shao Yunan, who was still paralyzed and sat on the ground due to recent events, and tried to help him get up. Shao Yunan turned around in surprise, when the other party helped him to sit down on a nearby stone, while the onlookers suddenly quieted down because of his appearance. \u201cWho can tell this official what is going on?\u201dThis, official?This official?This official?!\u201cThis is the County Magistrate! Why don\u2019t you kneel down when you see His Excellency?!\u201d Another person who stood beside County Magistrate Jiang shouted, giving the villagers a jolt as they knelt down and greeted, \u201cYour Excellency!\u201dHow could the County Magistrate be in Xiushui Village? Ah! Could it be that the one who came to look for Wang Shijing this time was the County Magistrate? Was Wang Shijing\u2019s wife really good friends with the County Magistrate?\u201cGet up.\u201d County Magistrate Jiang sat down next to Shao Yunan and asked, \u201cWhich one of you will tell me first what happened?\u201dFinally Tang Genshu walked out of the crowd, knelt down and said, \u201c Your Excellency, I saw Wang Zaizheng and three children stop Wang Qing and Wang Nizi a short while ago. They walked together for a while, but later Wang Zaizheng pushed Wang Qing into the river.\u201dShao Yunan clenched his teeth. In fact, Wang Zaizheng was only seven months younger than Wang Qing. But because Wang Qing grew up malnourished, Wang Zaizheng was stronger and taller than him. He also had other boys on his side, while Wang Qing needed to protect his sister. Thinking of the scene that might have happened, Shao Yunan wanted to drag Wang Zaizheng over and throw him directly into the river.County Magistrate Jiang asked, \u201cWas it you who saved Wang Qing?\u201d\u201cNo, it was Brother Tianbao.\u201d Shao Yunan was surprised, it was Zhou Tianbao? Then another villager came out and said, \u201cYour Excellency, it was Zhou Tianbao. He was the closest when Wang Qing fell into the water. Because Wang Nizi cried very loudly, Zhou Tianbao heard it and jumped into the water to save Wang Qing.\u201d\u201cThen where is Zhou Tianbao?\u201d\u201cAnswering Your Excellency, Zhou Tianbao went home to change his clothes.\u201d Shao Yunan whispered, \u201cYour Excellency, Zhou Tianbao\u2019s brain was burned out when he was a child, so his mentality is just like that of a child.\u201d County Magistrate Jiang nodded, finally understanding the situation. Having nothing more to say, he looked around and asked, \u201cWhere is Xiushui Village\u2019s Head?\u201d\u201cYour Excellency, this underling is here.\u201d Zhao Lizheng was also a small official, so in front of the County Magistrate he had to call himself \u2018underling.\u2019 County Magistrate Jiang said, \u201cI want you to go and bring Wang Zaizheng and his family, as well as the other three children and their families for questioning.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhao Lizheng then turned to Tang Genshu and asked, \u201cDo you recognize who those three boys were?\u201d Tang Genshu nodded, when someone next to him also said, \u201cI recognized them too.\u201d\u201cYou guys come with me.\u201d Zhao Lizheng took the people who knew which children were there, while also taking several strong men along with them. Since the County Magistrate was here, it was no longer just a clan or Xiushui Village\u2019s matter. It\u2019s useless for the patriarch to plead for mercy. Both Wang Wenhe and Wang Shuping were in the crowd. Wang Wenhe\u2019s face was pale. The Wang clan was once again disgraced in front of County Magistrate Jiang. He just couldn\u2019t understand why his family could not live in peace and quiet!While waiting for the people to come, County Magistrate Jiang asked the person beside him, \u201cYunan, what was the method you used to save your son Qing just now?\u201dCalling his name directly secretly shocked the villagers. Shao Yunan was so familiar and close with him? Shao Yunan calmly replied, \u201cLord, this method is called \u2018artificial respiration method.\u2019 I\u2019ve seen others use it on drowning people before, so just now I used it on little Qing since it was an emergency, but I didn\u2019t expect it to work. If you think it is useful, I can find someone to draw it and bring it to you.\u201d\u201cVery useful. Can this method only be used for people who drowned?\u201d\u201cWell, I think that it can be used for people who suddenly stop breathing. Sometimes a dead horse is still a living horse, so if there is some hope we can\u2019t give up.\u201d Shao Yunan squeezed his palms and smiled bitterly, \u201cI\u2019m still soft all over.\u201dCounty Magistrate Jiang nodded. \u201cGood. This official will send someone to find you later, so you can draw this method of artificial respiration.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAt this time, the magistrate\u2019s people escorted old lady Wang\u2019s family over, together with the crying Wang Zaizheng. The families of the other three children were also escorted over. Once they saw the county magistrate they first knelt down and then began to shout injustice, especially old lady Wang whose voice was the loudest.\u201cShut up!\u201d The county magistrate\u2019s men shouted angrily, making the scene quiet. The man who was sent by County Magistrate Jiang to investigate also came back and directly said, \u201cYour Excellency, I have found out that the young child Wang Zaizheng, together with three children of the same age from the same clan had evil intentions towards Wang Qing and Wang Nizi. Wang Zaizheng shouted at that time that he would kill Wang Qing and Wang Nizi.\u201dCounty Magistrate Jiang\u2019s eyes narrowed as old lady Wang opened her mouth and shouted, \u201cYour Excellency, that\u2019s wrong. Wang Zaizheng is only five years old, how could he want to kill someone.\u201d County Magistrate Jiang said, \u201cIf you disrupt this case again, you will be slapped in the face.\u201dOld lady Wang shrank and no longer dared to make a sound. Wang Zhisong looked anxious and with hatred at his nephew Wang Zaizheng. Why was the county magistrate here? County Magistrate Jiang\u2026 \u201cContinue.\u201dThe subordinate continued. \u201cI asked the three children and all three of them said that Wang Zaizheng wanted to teach Wang Qing and Wang Nizi a lesson, because Wang Qing and Wang Nizi\u2019s fathers Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan caused his parents to go to prison. So he wanted to threaten to kill Wang Qing and Wang Nizi to avenge his parents and said that with his younger uncle Wang Zhisong, the patriarch will not ask for an explanation.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d County Magistrate Jiang looked at the shivering Wang Zhisong, but still asked, \u201cWhich one is the patriarch of the Wang clan?\u201d Patriarch Wang shivered as he stepped out of the crowd. \u201cI am here.\u201d\u201cPatriarch Wang, this official wants to ask you why Wang Zaizheng would say that with his uncle around, even if he killed someone, you, the clan patriarch would not ask any questions? Or is it that among your Wang clan, there are rules greater than the laws of the court?\u201d\u201cMy Lord, spare my life!\u201d Patriarch Wang knelt down.Unable to bear his father\u2019s punishment, Wang Shuping rushed out and also knelt down. \u201cMy Lord, I am Wang Shuping and this is my father. I can testify that my father never said this. Even though my father may be biased, he would never harbor clan members who killed people. Please get to the bottom of this, Your Excellency!\u201dShao Yunan also spoke out. \u201cYour Excellency, although the patriarch is fond of Wang Zhisong\u2019s studying, he would never sit back and watch his clan members kill people. Wang Zaizheng is just a child who would say such things. He must have heard something and thought something like this.\u201d Wang Shuping was very grateful to Shao Yunan.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if this official does not punish you because you are young, he will punish your parents. If the three of you don\u2019t want your parents to be punished for your mistakes, you will tell this official\u00a0 exactly what Wang Zaizheng said to you. \u201c\u201cYour excellency! Wang Zaizheng would never say such things, they must be talking nonsense! \u201d Wang Zhisong vaguely pre-empted the attack. County Magistrate Jiang\u2019s eyes were cold. \u201cSlap him in the face.\u201d Wang Zhisong\u2019s face turned pale, \u201cYour Excellency! I am a child student!\u201d\u201cSlap him thirty times!\u201d A subordinate went over and held Wang Zhisong down, slapping him left and right. Old lady Wang tried to stop him, but she heard County Magistrate Jiang say, \u201cIf you stop him, you will be the one to be slapped thirty times!\u201d Old lady Wang whimpered and cried, but did not dare to move.Since childhood, Wang Zhisong, not to mention being slapped, no one had dared to even lay a finger on him, so after thirty slaps he directly fainted. Old lady Wang threw herself at him, but never dared to cry out. The villagers were too scared to move because of the County Magistrate\u2019s anger. Shao Yunan also did not expect County Magistrate Jiang to order his men to hit Wang Zhisong.The county magistrate looked at the three children, making all three children\u2019s parents urge them to tell the truth. Afraid that the thirty slaps might land on their own faces. The three children were crying and talking to each other. Wang Zaizheng was able to attend classes, and had an uncle at home who was good at studying and would take an examination.Because of this, the children must have curried favor with him, so these children were Wang Zaizheng\u2019s followers. But when Wang Tianyan and Wang Guo were sent to prison, Wang Zaizheng stopped attending reading classes and listened to old lady Wang\u2019s curses at home all day. This made him want to take revenge on Wang Qing and Wang Nizi, as Wang Zaizheng and Wang Zhisong had no way to get rid of Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan for the time being.Wang Zaizheng never hid the fact that old lady Wang, Wang Guo, and Wang Chunxiu were planning to sell Wang Nizi. Wang Zhisong had also said that after he passed his examination and returned, that he would take revenge on Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan. For Wang Zaizheng, it was only a matter of time before his youngest uncle would pass his exams. The clan patriarch also curried favor with their family, so it was okay for him to kill Wang Qing and Wang Nizi. No matter how important the county magistrate was, will he be better than his uncle who wanted to take the top spot on the examination and become an official in the capital? His uncle also said that the county magistrate will change in a few years and then it would be time to take revenge on Wang Shijing\u2019s family.Not to mention County Magistrate Jiang\u2019s expression after hearing this, Wang Wenhe almost died on the spot, while others looked in disgust at Wang Dali\u2019s family and moved away as far as possible. Old lady Wang shouted and tried to beat the three children, but County Magistrate Jiang had already given his order. \u201cDisturb this official\u2019s handling of the case and you will be charged with 30 more board hits!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cOw! Sir!\u201dThe two subordinates did not bring a board, but they directly found a stretcher and began to execute the punishment. Old lady Wang was screaming as she was beaten, but no one dared to speak out or plead for her. While a few people were willing to plead for her, Wang Dali and Wang Chunxiu were too afraid to say anything. County Magistrate Jiang looked with cold eyes at the old lady\u2019s bleeding buttocks, while Shao Yunan whispered pleading, \u201cExcellency, don\u2019t beat her any longer, otherwise it will be difficult for this little brother to live well in this village.\u201dCounty Magistrate Jiang was not moved as he said in a loud voice, \u201cThis official has previously warned Wang Zhisong to restrain his family, but this official now sees that things have only been intensifying. The mother is not strict with her own son\u2019s discipline and ignores official orders as if they were nothing. If it wasn\u2019t for this official thinking of her age, her head would be cut off. Continue punishment!\u201d After the thirty strokes, old lady Wang also fainted.County Magistrate Jiang looked at Patriarch Wang and the other people. \u201cToday\u2019s matter is already very clear. This case involves children, so according to the law of our dynasty, this official will not punish them. But their fathers and mothers cannot be blamed\u2026 They are still villagers of Xiushui Village and Wang clan members. Since Wang Qing\u2019s life is no longer in danger, I will hand them over to you for punishment. I hope you two can handle the case impartially and don\u2019t let me see anyone act recklessly again because of the patriarch\u2019s protection.\u201d\u201cYour excellency forgives and rest his anger.\u201d Village head Zhao Lizheng hurriedly knelt down. Wang Wenhe, supported by Wang Shuping, also knelt down. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed.\u201dCounty Magistrate Jiang stood up and looked at Wang Zhisong, who was laying there like a corpse and said with a cold eyes, \u201cThis official will write to the governor to remove Wang Zhisong\u2019s status as a child student. Tell him that he doesn\u2019t have to go to the county school either.\u201dThere was an uproar at the scene. Wang Dali\u2019s body swayed as he sat down on the ground paralyzed. Wang Chunxiu was already completely stunned as County Magistrate Jiang no longer bothered to look at them and turned to Shao Yunan. \u201cCan we go?\u201dShao Yunan stood up and said, \u201cCan.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go back.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShao Yunan took County Magistrate Jiang back, as the people watched the magistrate leave with Shao Yunan. Each of them was fearful, waiting until County Magistrate Jiang and Shao Yunan\u2019s figure disappeared before Zhao Lizheng ordered with a black face, \u201cPatriarch Wang, they are all your clan members. Escort them all to your Wang ancestral hall!\u201dWang Wenhe could no longer speak so Wang Shiping said on his behalf, \u201cEscort them all away!\u201d There was a sudden cry and even Wang Zhisong and old lady Wang who had fainted were carried away.When they returned home and closed the gate, Shao Yunan bowed deeply to County Magistrate Jiang. \u201cThank you, Your Excellency, for giving justice to my family of four!\u201d Whatever County Magistrate Jiang\u2019s purpose was at this moment, he was still extremely grateful.County Magistrate Jiang regained some of his gentleness as he spoke, \u201cGo and see how the child is doing first. If it weren\u2019t for me, Brother Qing wouldn\u2019t be in trouble in the first place.\u201d\u201cYou are wrong, Your Excellency. If you hadn\u2019t been here today, I\u2019m afraid this matter would have been hidden again. As you heard just now, Your Excellency, Wang Zaizheng has been looking for opportunities to hurt Qing and Nizi. It is always hard to guard against the hidden arrows.\u201d\u201cYunan, your excellency.\u201d Wang Shijing came out of the house and County Magistrate Jiang immediately asked, \u201cHow is the child?\u201dWang Shijing, who was not wearing an eye patch and whose left eye was still a little red, said, \u201cHe soaked in hot water, drank some ginger soup and medicine, and fell asleep. I also put Wang Nizi to sleep.\u201dShao Yunan immediately said, \u201cShijing, the lord has just made the decision for us.\u201d Wang Shijing immediately bowed. \u201cLord Jiang.\u201d\u201cThis is what officials should do.\u201dCounty Magistrate Jiang told Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan not to be polite. While Shao Yunan looked at Wang Qing and Wang Nizi\u2019s room and whispered, \u201cWhere is the fourth aunt?\u201d\u201cJust left.\u201dShao Yunan exhaled. \u201cBut I would like to thank uncle and aunt Zhou. It was Zhou Tianbao who rescued Wang Qing, which made Tang Genshu notice that something was wrong and call people for help.\u201dWang Shijing nodded. The muscles of his body were still tight, his anger had obviously still not subsided. County Magistrate Jiang said, \u201cSince the child is all right, this official will go back. You two can settle down at home and then go to the Yamen to find this official.\u201dShao Yunan hurriedly said, \u201cIf your Excellency is not in a hurry to go back, the child is mainly frightened so after two days he will be fine. Since you are here, come in and sit down. You still haven\u2019t finished drinking your cup of tea.\u201dWang Shijing also said, \u201cPlease come in and sit down. Wang Qing is going to sleep for a while after drinking the medicine. The village doctor also said that he would be fine after a few days of recuperation. Originally, Yunan and I planned to visit you today.\u201dSeeing that the two men\u2019s words were not false, County Magistrate Jiang followed them into the house. Then Shao Yunan asked Wang Shijing to bring his tea stove and alabaster teapot over. After Wang Shijing brought them, Shao Yunan boiled water and re-brewed a cup of golden silk royal chrysanthemum for County Magistrate Jiang. Wang Shijing sat next to Shao Yunan, his anger still not suppressed, while Shao Yunan who was not shy about it, held his hand appeasing him.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of this chrysanthemum or the water is simply just different?\u201d After a pause, County Magistrate Jiang\u00a0 said, \u201cI am the same age as Shijing. I am just a few months older than him, so in private you two can call me Kangning.\u201d\u201cMy lord?\u201d Both of them were surprised. Jiang Kangning, however, showed a hint of shame and said, \u201cYunan, Shijing, I won\u2019t go around in circles with you two anymore. I came here today to ask for something.\u201dJiang Kangning had already lowered his stance, so Shao Yunan said, \u201cBrother Kangning, don\u2019t say anything else, you just made the decision for my young brother. If you have any requests, just ask, I will do it.\u201d Since you are willing to let me and Shijing call you \u2018big brother,\u2019 what was wrong with treating Shijing and I as your brothers?Jiang Kangning, however, had some difficulty in opening his mouth. He tightened and clenched his teeth before he finally said, \u201cYunan, Shijing, can you sell me the recipe for that jam? Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t sell it within Yongxiu Province.\u201dShao Yunan blinked, surprised. Wang Shijing was also stunned. Jiang Kangning exhaled and said, \u201cI know my request would embarrass you and I also know that you and the Zhao family signed a contract. But I learned that although Yizhang Xuan restaurant also sold jam in the capital, the amount was insufficient and the numbers could not be guaranteed. My brother is doing business in the capital. He might not be as good as the boss behind Yizhang Xuan restaurant, but I want to find a business for him that can make money to ensure he has a worry-free life.\u00a0 I only let my brother do business in the capital, so he will not compete with Yizhang Xuan restaurant for business.\u201dShao Yunan was still blinking, so Jiang Kangning immediately added, \u201cIf it is really difficult, you two can just pretend that I did not mention this matter. I also understand that my request might be difficult for you.\u201dShao Yunan instantly returned to his senses. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not difficult. Brother Kangning, you must not misunderstand. In fact, the deed I signed with Uncle Lizheng\u2019s family does state that I still hold the ownership of the recipe, so I can still sell it to other families if it won\u2019t affect uncle Lizheng\u2019s business.\u201dJiang Kangning immediately looked shocked. \u201cThen can you sell it to me? I heard that the Zhao family paid 300 taels of silver for your recipe, I\u2019ll pay 500 taels.\u201dShao Yunan almost burst into tears. \u201cBrother Kangning, don\u2019t rush. This jam does seem to be very profitable now, but if people with their heads straight do more research, sooner or later someone else will make it. I think that the owner behind Yizhang Xuan restaurant is not a fool, so I won\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t find someone to study this jam recipe. In fact, this jam can only be considered a small business, in terms of the level of craft, it is not as good as this chrysanthemum tea.\u201dJiang Kangning smiled. \u201cThen are you going to sell me the recipe for this chrysanthemum tea?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Shao Yunan grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s a recipe that makes more money than jam or than chrysanthemum tea. If there is big money to be made, why would Brother Kangning bother with this small amount of money?\u201d Jiang Kangning raised his eyebrows, his gaze burning. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell it quickly?\u201d\u201cHaha.\u201d Shao Yunan looked at Wang Shijing. \u201cBrother Wang, please.\u201d Wang Shijing knew what he wanted so he went down to get it for him. Shao Yunan said, \u201cBrother Kangning, it\u2019s a real coincidence that you came today. This is a big coincidence. I was worried about finding the right person for business cooperation and was about to go to you to talk about it. To tell you the truth, I don\u2019t want everything to go through the Yizhang Xuan restaurant side. In the long run, it wouldn\u2019t be a good thing for me.\u201dJiang Kangning was so excited that he feigned anger. \u201cTell me what it is. Don\u2019t sell it anymore. If you are not careful this official might gift you a board.\u201d\u201cWhy, isn\u2019t it Brother Kangning?\u201d\u201c\u2026You, you.\u201dWang Shijing first brought the tea set and tea tray, then he brought a jar of Longjing. After Wang Shijing sat down, Shao Yunan boiled water first and said, \u201cI wonder if Brother Kangning knows that I collected tea leaves everywhere a while ago.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard a little about it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll let Brother Kangning taste the tea I made now and you can see if my tea can become a big deal.\u201dJiang Kangning restrained his expression.The water boiled and Shao Yunan scooped out the tea leaves. As soon as the tea leaves came out, Jiang Kangning\u2019s expression changed slightly. After finishing scooping the tea leaves, Shao Yunan handed it over. \u201cBrother Kangning, you smell it.\u201dJiang Kangning took the tea leaves and smelled them, his expression changing even more. \u201cThis is tea?\u201d\u201cIt is indeed.

    "Chapter 81": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fierce \u201cHusband\u201dCH 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 42Shao Yunan asked knowingly, \u201cBig brother, our Great State of Yan is very poor, right?\u201d Jiang Kangning nodded with a sigh, \u201cYes. The court can only impose taxes and after the taxes are imposed, the people become even worse off, making the court even poorer.\u201dShao Yunan said: \u201cThis is a vicious circle. If you ask me, if the court wants money, it can\u2019t always only keep an eye on the farmers. Farmers depend on heaven for a living, how many acres of land can a family grow? If they want to be rich they need to develop business.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jiang Kangning\u2019s tone was suddenly a little eager. Shao Yunan said, \u201cNo matter which dynasty, merchants are the most profitable and the richest. The imperial court should vigorously develop commerce. The merchants will become very rich and if the imperial court\u2019s taxation focuses on the merchants, then not only will the pressure on the farmers be reduced, the imperial court\u2019s taxation can also be guaranteed.\u201d\u201cAs the pressure on the farmers is reduced, their days will become better and the imperial court will also become more stable. Although the merchants will pay more taxes because of the court\u2019s support, they will also earn more. While the imperial court will use the taxes collected to build homes, improve people\u2019s livelihood, and strengthen military equipment. In this way won\u2019t our country become safe and secure?\u201dJiang Kangning licked his lips, \u201cThere is indeed some truth in that. But how to develop business? Also, if everyone goes into business, who would plant the fields? Without food it is absolutely not going to work.\u201d This was also the main reason why most of the dynasties in history have valued agriculture over commerce.Shao Yunan said, \u201cOur Great State of Yan definitely has the most farmers, even if we open up commerce and encourage people to do business, how many of them can really do it? Business is not the same as farming. The intricacies and twists and turns are not something that ordinary people can understand. For farmers, having a field and land is always fundamental.\u201d\u201cIn other words, on the one hand, the court will have money and on the other, it encourages business. It will also increase support for households to plant, reduce taxes, and improve the purchase price of food, while the farmers will naturally try their best to plant more. This is complimentary. At that time, not only will there be no shortage of grain, but there will be even more grain.\u201dJiang Kangning nodded again and again and urged, \u201cGo on, how can you develop business?\u201d Shao Yunan\u2026 \u201cThe development of commerce should be multi-dimensional. The first thing is to expand domestic demand. That is, to enhance the commercial exchanges between the subjects of the Great State of Yan and increase tax revenue for the court. As an example, jam and chrysanthemum tea are sold within the Great State of Yan, earning uncle Lizheng and patriarch Sun\u2019s families a lot of money as a result. This could be used for internal needs and develop commerce, so that the people become rich and let money flow.\u201dJiang Kangning nodded, his eyes burning. \u201cSecond, it is to raise external demand. Although we have just finished a war, not all surrounding countries are enemies of our Great State of Yan, right? Those countries that are good friends with our Great State of Yan or do not have much contact with each other, must have something that our Great State of Yan does not have.\u201d\u201cOn the other hand, our country must have something they do not have, making it a profitable exchange for both sides and making trade and merchants moved by profit. The things we take out can be exchanged for the rare things we don\u2019t have or even real money. What we do not have, can also be exchanged from other countries for real silver and gold at home. With this back and forth, the imperial court can collect more money than by taxing farmers right?\u201dThe way Jiang Kangning looked at Shao Yunan gave Wang Shijing a sense of crisis once again. \u201cThe third is to enrich the commercial content and motivate people. Take jam and chrysanthemum tea as an example. Before there was no such thing, so people wouldn\u2019t think of using it to make money. Now everyone knows that chrysanthemum tea and jam can earn money. Since there are so many people willing to buy it, it means that there is money in making it. As long as similar commercial content is enriched, won\u2019t money just roll in? In addition, salt, grain, mining, and other more profitable businesses must be firmly in the hands of the court.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t let the merchants who are in contact with these businesses make a lot of money, while the court, who really holds these resources remain poor, right? These large transactions can be handed over to the people at the bottom, but the court should ensure that the largest portion of the profits go to the court. When the court encourages commercial activities, it is natural for intelligent people to find ways to make money. I could come up with\u00a0 jam and chrysanthemum tea, so others would also come up with other good ideas.\u201d\u201cWhat else?\u201d Now only Shao Yunan was in Jiang Kangning\u2019s eyes.\u201cWhen the court is rich and the people are rich, there will be internal stability. Externally, we strengthen our business relations with other countries and develop our advantages in the process. Sometimes, war is not just a sword and number of people, sometimes commerce can also be used as a weapon. If a certain country\u2019s business is particularly dependent on our country, as soon as we block trade with them, they will be in chaos. With the territory of our country, if we really want to do business, our country will definitely have the upper hand.\u201d Jiang Kangning nodded his head vigorously, his blood boiling.\u201cIf the court has money, many aspects can go more smoothly. For example, when conscripting soldiers, military pay can be raised to attract soldiers. In addition, if someone from any family joins the army, the court will not only give a certain reward, but also exempt a certain amount of field taxes. Also if they die in battle for the county, their children and parents will have pensions and preferential treatment. If you become disabled while fighting for the county, the court will not only give you a pension, but also exempt a few acres of land from taxation for 100 years. There would be plenty of people who would be willing to join the army.\u201d\u201cWhat else!\u201d Jiang Kangning really wanted to see how many \u2018strange\u2019 ideas Shao Yunan\u2019s head was loaded with.\u201cBy the same token, if the bulk of the tax revenue is not from farmers, then the court can also set up some incentive measures when recruiting people for corvee from peasant households, so that the court will not become very passive. Although the court has no money now and the country is poor, there are still many rich people. Just like the marquis\u2019 house that has money.\u201d\u201cThen our first step is to earn the money from these rich people and then develop commerce step by step. Just as more and more people from the Zhao clan have joined in making jam and more and more people have earned money, by this analogy, sooner or later there will be more and more rich people and people will have more and more spare money in their hands. Making the country richer and richer.\u201dShao Yunan pointed to the tea in the cup. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about overnight success. If this tea can reach my expectation, big brother can integrate all the tea resources in Yongxiu County next year. We will make a large quantity of tea and then the eldest brother will hold a tea tasting party to invite tea merchants and businessmen interested in the tea business from all over the province to spread the popularity of the Yongxiu [New Tea]. This will not only drive the province\u2019s people to grow tea and make tea in the future, it will also make our province rich.\u201d\u201cIf done like this, the experience of our Yongxiu tea can be popularized nationwide. As long as there is a place where tea is produced in abundance, they can also do the same thing. There are thousands of kinds of tea. The tea that you just tasted is only one kind of green tea. There is also black tea, white tea, and so on. You have also tasted this tea. I believe that this tea will not only set the wind in our Great State of Yan, but it will certainly be used in exchange for real money in other countries!\u201dHe was kidding, he long since knew that tea was a good thing that has been exported through the centuries. Jiang Kangning was short of breath. \u201cIf the eldest brother wants to build our Yongxiu Tea Country, in fact there are two backers that no one else can compare to. If you can pull these two backers into the partnership, then no one will try to snatch this business from the hands of big brother.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cThe emperor and old teacher Weng.\u201d\u201cYunan!\u201d Wang Shijing was startled. No one should speak of the emperor so freely. Jiang Kangning, however, encouraged him. \u201cTell me about it.\u201d\u201cJust imagine old master Weng invites three or five five friends to his home to have a cup of tea, drink tea, recite poetry, or simply have some other activity. Those people will naturally ask what kind of tea it is and old master Weng will only say it\u2019s good tea for him. Then he came up with a simple way to make tea. Do you think those people would also like to make such tea?\u201d\u201cDefinitely!\u201d\u201cOld Master Weng drinks a tea that has never been seen before. With his prominent status, anyone who thinks they also have status will want to also drink this tea. In this way they can only ask big brother.\u201d\u201cJust imagine the emperor hosting a banquet and giving one person such a unique cup of tea and then revealing with his words that it was made by your elder brother. Just think, the tea drunk by the emperor is definitely a symbol of status. At that time, not to mention being rich, you also need to have some status before you can even buy it.\u201d\u201cAs you said, you will not only have the two most unshakable backers in the tea business, they can also advertise for you for free, um, like sign boards. Even if more people make tea in the future, those who have money and status will definitely want the best tea. I dare to slap my chest and promise that the tea I give to your brother will definitely be the best of best.\u201d\u201cNot to mention a hundred taels of silver a kilo, a thousand taels a kilo can also be made, depending on whether you want to sell it. Can the son of a marquis be more powerful than the emperor and old master Weng? So big brother, I sincerely recommend that you pull these two into the partnership. Isn\u2019t the emperor also short of money?\u201dJiang Kangning\u2019s heart fluttered due to Shao Yunan\u2019s words, but he still pointed at him, \u201cYou, you, you must never say such words again. You need to be careful or you might be accused of defying the emperor.\u201dShao Yunan laughed. \u201cI just gave my big brother a suggestion. I will not say things like this to others. Big brother, why don\u2019t you wait until the wine is ready and take it to the emperor and old master Weng to taste it together? If the two great gods are willing to join him, your brother\u2019s business will be foolproof and we will just need to wait to make money.\u201dJiang Kangning slowly put away his smile and said, \u201cYunan, big brother accepts your heart. He also doesn\u2019t know how he might be able to repay it in the future. But big brother will promise you and Shijing that as long as he is an official, he will be your family\u2019s backer.\u201dShao Yunan\u2026 \u201cBig Brother!\u201dWang Shijing\u2026 \u201cBig Brother!\u201dAs soon as the thanks were over, Shao Yunan said, \u201cBrother, I want to enroll Brother Qing in White Moon Academy, please think of a way. Qing will be seven years old next year so it is not impossible for him to go to a private school, right?\u201dJiang Kangning was so happy, that after thinking for a moment he said, \u201cBring me some tea first and I\u2019ll give it to Dean Cen. I won\u2019t say who gave it to him at first, but when he takes the bait your wine should already be ready. Then I will also take it to him, greet him, and make a request. Tea and wine have always been Dean Cen\u2019s favorites.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019m counting on you, Brother! I will give you some of each of these four classes of tea and you can keep them for yourself. After the wine is made and you taste it, you can also arrange what you want to do yourself. I have nearly seventy kilos of fourth-grade tea here, 30 barrels of wine in large barrels, and 15 barrels of wine in small barrels.\u201d\u201cGood. Big brother should also not be polite with me. After the wine is brewed, your big brother will personally go to the capital to talk about this sale.\u201d\u201cGood!\u201dShao Yunan gave Jiang Kangning a tea jar for each class of tea and also gave him a jar of ordinary chrysanthemum tea and fifty golden silk royal chrysanthemums. He also took out three jars of red sour fruit jam that were kept in his space. Next, Jiang Kangning had a careful chat with Shao Yunan about his business idea, only feeling that he was in no mood for the New year meal. It was not until the afternoon that Jiang Kangning returned to the county town with what Shao Yunan had given him and his great ambition for the future.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fierce \u201cHusband\u201dCH 43.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43.1Watching Jiang Kangning\u2019s carriage go far away, Shao Yunan pulled Wang Shijing to close the door and prepared to go back to the house. No sooner had the door closed, than he was hugged with a great force that almost broke his ribs. Shao Yunan hissed and after being slightly released from the iron grip, he stroked the other party\u2019s taut waist and back.At this moment, Shao Yunan didn\u2019t speak any comforting words. All he had to do was quietly let Wang Shijing hold him. Telling the other person that he was here. Shao Yunan could not see Wang Shijing\u2019s expression, but he knew that this man must be dealing with great hatred at this moment.After a long time, the cold breeze of early winter made Shao Yunan\u2019s hands cold, as Wang Shijing\u2019s muffled voice rang in his ears. \u201cWithout you, Wang Qing would have been lost.\u201d With this sentence, the force in the arm hugging him became stronger.\u201cThis hypothesis is not valid. I was right, our Qing is lucky. If they had told me about it even a moment later, I might not have been able to help him. After today, Wang Qing and Nizi\u2019s suffering should end. There must be blessings after surviving such a disaster, so Wang Qing\u2019s future life will be smooth and safe.\u201dThe cold lips landed on Shao Yunan\u2019s forehead, then little by little, like a water they fell on eyebrows, bridge of his nose and finally covered his mouth. Soon, their cold lips became hot.Neither had the intention to enter the house, so in the cold courtyard, the two bodies got closer to each other, as they kissed with a strong attachment to each other. Shao Yunan was not incorrect. After Wang Qing\u2019s accident, not only Wang Qing, but also this man\u2019s suffering should come to an end. Jiang Kangning\u2019s actions have completely solved Wang Shijing\u2019s worries, allowing his man to break free from his shackles.Wang Qing and Nizi were still sleeping so Shao Yunan didn\u2019t wake them up to ask them to eat. After boiling chicken soup and slowly simmering it over a small fire, Shao Yunan brought Wang Shijing, who was still fearful, back to the house. Despite the fact that Shao Yunan had a chat with Jiang Kangning just now, he was afraid that things might not be so easily solved as they were this morning, so he asked Wang Zhuang to guard Wang Qing and Wang Nizi\u2019s room.Shao Yunan only then had the time to tell Wang Shijing about what happened before and also how Jiang Kangning ordered punishment. Hearing that Wang Zaizheng was the one who tried to kill Wang Qing and Wang Nizi, Wang Shijing\u2019s one eye was filled with killing intent. But after hearing that old lady Wang was beaten with thirty boards and Wang Zhisong was slapped thirty times, while also being stripped of his status as a child student, he became indifferent, even though they were his own mother and brother.After Shao Yunan continued to rub his chest for many hours, Wang Shijing exhaled a final sigh and planted a final kiss on Shao Yunan\u2019s mouth. He asked, \u201cWhy did County Magistrate Jiang let us call him big brother? Is it reliable to do business with him?\u201dShao Yunan pondered, \u201cI\u2019m also curious why he was more protective of us from the beginning. In theory when I first went to the county town school, I had nothing for him to value. Even if he wanted the stone, he still gave it back to me later. That is why I thought he was really just and not a hypocrite. This is what I don\u2019t understand. His attitude towards us, it\u2019s not hypocritical.\u201d\u201cThis time when he came to buy the jam recipe, I also thought it was very difficult for him to ask. I can also understand some of his meaning. His older brother is doing business in the capital and he has a teacher who looks after him, but he still seems to face some difficulties. But if he doesn\u2019t want to say, it would not be good to ask more about it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s also why I suggested that he pull his teacher and the emperor into the partnership. Our family\u2019s tea and wine will definitely attract the attention of many parties. If my guess is right, then his brother and his power alone will definitely not be able to keep the tea and wine business. But if his teacher and the emperor can join the partnership, then it\u2019s different.\u201d\u201cThe emperor.\u201d Wang Shijing felt that there was not much hope.Shao Yunan smiled, \u201cThe emperor is also short of money. From what I\u2019ve heard about the current emperor\u2019s actions he should be a wise ruler who wants to encourage good governance, but his father was too ineffective. Making the kingdom spoiled.\u201d\u201cEven if you want to encourage the rule, you have to have money first. I think the emperor is not only very poor, but also afraid of the powerful officials that have their hand everywhere. He has only been on the throne for four years, so it\u2019s not easy for him to fix the mess left by his father overnight.\u201d\u201cLooking at the present situation, prices are still rising, but the people\u2019s lives are only getting worse and the country has not developed significantly. You just need to look at the increasing number of refugees in Yongxiu County town to know the current situation. Yongxiu County would not be much better if it were not for its good geographical location.\u201d\u201cIt can also be said that the mess left by the emperor\u2019s father is not ordinary. If the present situation is not quickly improved, not to mention the invasion of foreign enemies, the country itself will collapse first. When the common people are no longer able to live, it\u2019s the beginning of civil strife. \u201cPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Without any outsiders inside, Wang Shijing never cared what his wife did or said. But because Shao Yunan mentioned the emperor in front of Jiang Kangning, Wang Shijing reminded him that there was an outsider present.At this time, there were only the two husbands and the two children who slept soundly in the next room. Wang Shijing not only accepted his wife\u2019s strange views, but also told his wife some inside information. \u201cWhen I joined the army, I was assigned under the command of a small general. There were many big generals in the little general\u2019s family and the great, mighty, and powerful General is the grandfather of General Dai Xiao. Their family is also very much trusted by the emperor, but during the last emperor\u2019s reign, their family suffered some injustice.\u201d\u201cI heard that thanks to his Royal Highness\u2019 attack, who is now the present emperor, their family was able to survive. Later, his Royal Highness succeeded the throne and used their family again. This time in \u2018Huhar country\u2019s invasion, the small general was appointed as the avant-guard general and his eldest uncle Minghui, who led the whole army, was appointed as the vanguard general.\u201d\u201cIt was precisely because I followed such generals that I was able to bring back the money and jewelry. For the villagers who went under the command of the other generals, getting part of their military pay was already good. I heard that many soldiers could not even get a penny and became bandits. The little general also led us around to wipe out the mountain bandits and gave us the gold and silver treasures hidden by these mountain bandits. He said that the imperial court is now poor, so we should not blame the army for being paid so little.\u201dShao Yunan wrinkled his eyebrows. \u201cThis phenomenon of drinking soldiers\u2019 blood was very serious?\u201d Wang Shijing nodded. \u201cVery serious. The court had no money, so at most they could only guarantee the general\u2019s pay. Someone even dared to embezzle General Dai\u2019s military pay. There were even some that embezzled directly from the Ministry of War, not to mention below. Other generals also deducted some of the soldiers\u2019 pay, but I was lucky. General Dai not only gave us all the pay we could get, he also gave his own pay and rewards to the soldiers with disabilities, so we soldiers were willing to fight for him.\u201dShao Yunan did not expect that there were really wise generals that could only be seen in history books and asked curiously, \u201cWhat was the name of that young general? Were you always a junior soldier when you were a soldier?\u201dWang Shijing said, \u201cHis name is Dai Zhanli and it seems to be written like this.\u201d He wrote the word \u2018Zhanli\u2019 on the palm of Shao Yunan\u2019s hand. Shao Yunan felt like he had heard this name somewhere before, but he quickly ignored it. Maybe the original body\u2019s owner had heard the story of this young general somewhere.\u201cOn the behalf of this young general, ten thousand troops were in the vanguard. Before I returned to the village, I was a centurion.\u201d Shao Yunan touched the injured half of Wang Shijing\u2019s face. \u201cUnexpectedly you were a small leader, leading a hundred people. How did you get this injury?\u201dWang Shijing said, \u201cIn the last big battle, everyone was anxious as General Dai led us to surround the other side\u2019s general. It was then that I was injured by one of the other side\u2019s lieutenants. Then I cut off his arm and stabbed him to death.\u201d\u201cThen you have done meritorious service, haven\u2019t you? Why did you go back to the village? Because you were hurt?\u201dWang Shijing said, \u201cNot at all. My superior, Captain Baili, was killed in that war and many of my comrades-in-arms were also killed. After three years in the army, I was also tired and always worried about the situation at home. I happened to be partially blind, so I proposed that I go back to my village. General Dai allowed it, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be able to come back.\u201d\u201cAccording to the law, I had to serve for ten years before I could come home. I also didn\u2019t take the merit and gave it to captain Baili, so that General Dai could ask for pension money for him. He cherished us little soldiers very much, so my becoming a centurion was also thanks to him.\u201d What he didn\u2019t say was that if he had really accepted the military merit and got a promotion, with the temperament of his family members, he couldn\u2019t even imagine how much they would try to use him. For him to get separated from that family, it was best to have nothing.\u201cWell, you were right, if you took the credit for this, even if you were seriously injured, you probably wouldn\u2019t be able to come back and had to stay in the army. Besides, your family isn\u2019t in need of money, so it was best to give it to those who needed it more.\u201dWang Shijing hugged his wife tightly. He knew that his wife would understand him. If he accepted the military merit, he might not have been able to marry his wife, which was absolutely not possible. Wang Shijing continued, \u201cAs you said, the court is also a mess and the emperor won\u2019t be able to\u00a0 rectify the administration of the officials overnight.\u201d\u201cThe situation in the army is no better than that of the court. If I had stayed in the army, I might have been under the command of my young general and been okay. But if I was transferred to another general\u2026 I am afraid that I might not even know how I would die. It was better to come back and marry a good wife, so you can warm my bed.\u201dShao Yunan pinched Wang Shijing\u2019s scarred face. \u201cCan you be more shameless? If Song hadn\u2019t divorced you, how could you get married again? I wouldn\u2019t see you either.\u201d Wang Shijing pulled down his wife\u2019s hand and held it tightly. \u201cThis assumption is not valid, you are now my wife.\u201dSo he learned how to use it\u2026 well, it seems that this child could still be taught. Shao Yunan changed his hand to touch the other half of Wang Shijing\u2019s face and muttered, \u201cThe scars have faded a bit and they are not as hideous as when I first saw you. Can you still not see with that eye?\u201d Was it necessary to directly use spiritual milk?Wang Shijing rubbed his wife\u2019s not-so-soft hand. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be okay, there\u2019s a little light now.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cWell, I can feel the light and it\u2019s especially obvious at dawn.\u201d Shao Yunan smiled. \u201cMaybe it will be completely fine.\u201d\u201cWell, with my wife around, it will definitely get better.\u201dWang Shijing was sure that his eye condition had something to do with his wife. Shao Yunan rolled his eyes and said, \u201cIf it gets better, what will you say to everyone?\u201dWang Shijing said, \u201cI\u2019ll just say that it\u2019s the medicine prescribed by the military doctor. I got injured not long before coming back, so it\u2019s not surprising that I can see again.\u201d\u201cSo smart.\u201d Pinching Wang Shijing\u2019s face, Shao Yunan did not shy away from giving him a kiss on his injured eye. \u201cIt will get better.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d Tightening his arm once again, Wang Shijing still didn\u2019t ask anything.Bang. Bang. Bang. There was a knock on the door outside, so Wang Shijing let Shao Yunan go and got off the bed. Shao Yunan did not move, as Wang Shijing dressed and went out. After a long time, he came back from outside and brought in some cold air. Shao Yunan, who felt a little drowsy after rescuing Wang Qing, had been feeling weak, but still talked with Jiang Kangning for such a long time. Now the weakness came up and since his bed was warm, he wanted to sleep.Seeing him like that, Wang Shijing took off his clothes and got into the bed. Putting his hands around Shao Yunan, he also closed his eyes and did not say that the clans came to him to tell him what they planned to do with those people. Finding a comfortable position in Wang Shijing\u2019s arms, Shao Yunan cooed, \u201cLet\u2019s eat noodles tonight.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Tucking in the blanket, Wang Shijing took a deep breath, exhaled slowly, and then closed his eyes as well. The two of them cuddled together for a good sleep, as Wang Shijing was a little tired after his mental relaxation. Not long after they woke up, Wang Qing and Nizi also woke up. Finding that their father and little father were there, Wang Nizi jumped into her little father\u2019s arms, hugging him and crying. Wang Qing also had tears in his eyes, so Wang Shijing held Wang Qing over the quilt and then held Shao Yunan and Wang Nizi with his other hand.\u201cNot afraid, not afraid.\u201d Shao Yunan coaxed Wang Nizi, as Wang Shijing touched his son\u2019s forehead. Not finding it feverish, he asked, \u201cIs there any discomfort? Is it hard on your chest?\u201d Wang Qing shook his head and opened his mouth to speak, but couldn\u2019t. Shao Yunan knew it was the after-effects of choking, so he handed Wang Nizi over to Wang Shijing and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go make some food for the child.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d Wang Shijing put the two children back on the bed, but Wang Nizi grabbed her father. \u201cFather, I want to go too.\u201d Wang Qing also grabbed his little father. The two children still had not yet recovered from the accident. Wang Shijing asked Shao Yunan to stay behind, while he went to cook noodles. Shao Yunan soothed the two children. \u201cLittle daddy is going out just for a moment, he will be right back.\u201dWang Qing hesitated for a moment and let go of his Little Dad\u2019s hand. Wang Nizi also let go of her little father. Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan then went to the kitchen together and\u00a0 Wang Shijing burned firewood. \u201cI\u2019ll buy another water tank in the future and we will use the water in it only for our family members. Don\u2019t worry, Wang Qing will be fine tomorrow.\u201d He patted Wang Shijing on his stiff shoulder, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything when we go to bed. Put some lard in the pot when cooking the noodles and also add some greens. Beat the egg lightly\u2026\u201dShao Yunan irresponsibly left Wang Shijing, who was frozen like a stone, behind as he went back to the room to accompany the two frightened children. After a long time, all the flames in the stove were extinguished, as Wang Shijing moved with a stiff neck, stiffly swallowing. Then he licked his lips as his head moved slowly like a puppet towards the water tank. After a long time, his hands unsteadily scooped up some water to take a sip.At that moment, Wang Shijing\u2019s body stiffened again. He had drunk this water before! He clearly remembered the first time he took Shao Yunan up the mountain to pick tea. Shao Yunan had given him a taste of this water. Hands trembling, Wang Shijing put down the water scoop, then touched his left eye, as his breathing gradually calmed down.Shao Yunan put one arm around Wang Qing and the other around Wang Nizi, as he told stories to the two children. The two children listened to the stories with interest, but still with a bit of fear. It took Wang Shijing much more time than usual to cook the four bowls of noodles. Seeing him come in with two bowls of noodles, Wang Shijing\u2019s face was calm as he looked at the four bowls of noodles as if they were normal. Shao Yunan nodded in his heart, his psychological tolerance was not bad.Shao Yunan let go of the two children. \u201cDinner is ready. After eating, you can take a break and then sleep. For today\u2019s matter, the county magistrate has taken revenge for you. Later when you see that family again, you shouldn\u2019t be afraid and should try fighting them, instead of hiding.\u201dWang Qing clenched his fist. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of them!\u201d Wang Nizi sniffed and suddenly called, \u201cDaddy, if Wang Zaizheng dares to bully me and my brother again I will bite him!\u201d\u201cOh, good. Come, eat the noodles.\u201d Wang Qing and Wang Nizi sat down, then Wang Nizi couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cLittle Father, what happened later?\u201d Shao Yunan said very maliciously \u201cLater\u2026 we should eat first.\u201d\u201cConcentrate on eating. After eating, little father will continue.\u201d Wang Shijing brought in two more bowls of noodles and sat next to Shao Yunan. One hand was placed on his lap, the heat of his palm penetrating straight through Shao Yunan\u2019s pants, causing goosebumps to rise on his body. Wang Shijing\u2019s silence was abnormal, but because the two children were bent on listening to the follow-up story, they didn\u2019t notice anything unusual about their dad and concentrated on eating noodles. After the four people finished eating, Wang Shijing took the bowls to the kitchen and soon came back to listen to the story of \u201cThe Three White Bones\u201d together with them.It could be said that Wang Shijing was very strong-willed. He remained motionless until the two children yawned and fell asleep. Then after Shao Yunan finished washing up, he came back to the bed, but Wang Shijing still did not speak. Without blowing out the oil lamp, Wang Shijing got into the bed and hugged the man there in his arms, then bowed his head and kissed him.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wasn\u2019t the plot not right? Shouldn\u2019t he be asked immediately what the bottle and the liquid were all about? Shao Yunan was confused, but Wang Shijing savagely ripped open his clothes and put his hand into his pants.\u201cUhhhh!\u201d Shao Yunan, who was gripped by his weak point, gasped. \u201cYou, why don\u2019t you ask?\u201d How come he didn\u2019t follow the script? \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you to tell me.\u201d Tearing off Shao Yunan\u2019s pants, Wang Shijing turned him over, then wrapped one hand strongly around his waist and put him in a lying position.\u201cAh!\u201d Shao Yunan felt dizzy due to Wang Shijing\u2019s unorthodox approach, as his soft, hot tongue licked his jewels, not giving him a chance to react. After f0ndling them with his lips and tongue, he went straight up and licked the small bvd that had opened and closed slightly under his tongue.\u201cAh!\u201d Tears came out of Shao Yunan\u2019s eyes. His neck tensed and his upper body suddenly lost its support and fell on the bed, as a pair of hot palms held his hips. While the sliding tongue made a rhythmic gesture to forcefully probe into the place where he had been longing to be vi0lated, Shao Yunan burst into tears.\u201cShijing\u2026 ah\u2026 um.\u201d Why did he suddenly have the impression that this guy was getting back at him? \u201cShijing\u2026 don\u2019t, don\u2019t\u2026 well\u2026 I must.\u201d Wang Shijing was unmoved as his tongue continued to work. A stream of hot liquid poured out and the five taels of flesh on Wang Shijing\u2019s lower body became purple and black.\u201cYou come in, I want you to come in! Ah!\u201d Shao Yunan screamed. He wanted it. His body, his whole person was eager for this person to come in. Wang Shijing straightened up his body, wrapped one hand around Shao Yunan\u2019s waist, lifted his lower body, and held his purple-black [email\u00a0protected] in one hand against Shao Yunan\u2019s already collapsing body. \u201cCome in come in!\u201d Shao Yunan was so anxious that he pounded the bed.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cMmmm\u2026\u201dShao Yunan, who was waiting to be fully entered, let out a moan of pleasure, while Wang Shijing let out a shuddering, muffled grunt. The thick head was squeezed into the moist place and although Shao Yunan, who was a pure zero, seemed to need no external lubrication at all, he still felt the dull pain in his body, as it was being forcefully pushed open.Then the head was fully inside, but Wang Shijing did not stop as the beads of sweat fell into the bedding along his strong body whose scars have faded a little more than before. Shao Yunan was covered with sweat as Wang Shijing pulled out and then came in again, but this time not just with his head.\u201cHoney, be patient.\u201d Wang Shijing gritted his teeth to control his impulse of going deeper. \u201cWhen you grow up I will give it all to you.\u201d This sentence almost made him use all his strength. \u201cYou son of a bitch! All in ah! Ahhhh!\u201dWang Shijing\u2019s movements suddenly accelerated as he was forced to enter only his head. But his movements were still rough and savage. Shao Yunan\u2019s body was going crazy from being stretched open, so he tried to relax, stretch open and relax again. He felt that Wang Shijing was born to seduce him and torture him.Wang Shijing\u2019s one eye was red, full of Shao Yunan\u2019s naked back and his tender mouth opening. His right hand clung to his front end, not daring to relax. He was too afraid to relax. Shao Yunan was still young, so if he went all out he could hurt his man\u2019s body.In Shao Yunan\u2019s moaning, crying and crazy lust, Wang Shijing finally shot a thick pulp on Shao Yunan slit. Shao Yunan\u2019s eyes were full of tears as he grunted, \u201cYou, you must be trying to take revenge on me.\u201d He felt bullied.Wang Shijing bent over and kissed Shao Yunan\u2019s shoulder where he had left a hickey. \u201cHoney, please grow up soon. I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d Shao Yunan sobbed, but a strong warmth welled up in his heart. \u201cAre you really not getting back at me?\u201d\u201cIf my wife wants to, I will wait. We almost lost Qing today so I wanted you. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it, but my wife is still young. Then he kissed him a few times. \u201cWife, I want to grow old with you.\u201dShao Yunan\u2019s still moist eyes instantly broke into tears, ignoring the stickiness on his body, he rolled over and hugged the man who was both honest and moody, who also liked to seduce him and bully him.\u201cCome with me.\u201d Wang Shijing only saw an instant light before his eyes when his braced body landed on the somewhat hard ground. Wang Shijing became completely dumbfounded. What was going on? What he just saw in front of his eyes! Shao Yunan just smiled and got out from under Wang Shijing. Not caring that he was naked, he walked to a semi-circular pool of water not far downstream from the spiritual spring and jumped in.The sound of water woke up Wang Shijing and when he saw Shao Yunan go into the pool, he got up with a jolt and chased after him in a panic. \u201cYun\u2019an!\u201d\u201cCome here and take a bath.\u201d This place was prepared by Shao Yunan to take baths. He drank from the spiritual spring, so he naturally wanted his bathing place to be separate from his drinking place. Wang Shijing, who saw his wife lying comfortably by the pool, looked around and asked, \u201cHoney, where are we?\u201d\u201cCome in and I will tell you.\u201d Wang Shijing walked in. Without any exception, it was not cold and even a little warm. Shao Yunan sat down, looking left and right, then nestled into his arms and said, \u201cThis is my secret. This is my space and it is also my world. You can also understand it as a land blessed by the gods.\u201d Shao Yunan looked up at the man, who was stunned. \u201cShijing, I\u2019m not who you think I am. That Shao Yunan died after jumping into the river\u2026 I am just a soul with the same name as him. Hiss!\u201dHis waist was going to break. Wasn\u2019t that guy still frozen? By exposing his biggest secret, the space, in front of Wang Shijing, Shao Yunan had no intention of concealing his identity. He didn\u2019t want Wang Shijing to think of him as the Shao Yunan who had been rejected by Wang Zhisong in Shaojia Village. He was not him.Shao Yunan told Wang Shijing that he was a person from thousands of years later, who died in an accident, but his soul came back in time to this country he didn\u2019t know anything about. He had become a different person, whose marriage was withdrawn and then married to another brother. He also told Wang Shijing how he got the space and why he has so many ideas that seem strange and weird to them.From the beginning, Wang Shijing just listened without saying a word. Only his arms around Shao Yunan revealed his restlessness.\u00a0 After all he wanted to say was finished, Shao Yunan asked, \u201cAre you afraid?\u201dWang Shijing pressed Shao Yunan\u2019s head to his bare chest and said in a muffled voice, \u201cYou are Shao Yunan, my wife. I don\u2019t care where you come from. You\u2019re just my wife.\u201d At the end, he also added roughly. \u201cYou\u2019re already married to me. You can\u2019t go anywhere.\u201dWang Shijing was afraid\u2026 afraid that Shao Yunan would go back to his world. Shao Yunan nibbled lightly on Wang Shijing\u2019s chest. \u201cI would like to go somewhere, but you have to give me our household registration certificate first.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Wang Shijing hugged him. \u201cWife\u2026 stay with me.\u201d\u201cIf you plant the land here, I will consider it.\u201dWang Shijing lifted Shao Yunan\u2019s face and kissed him eagerly. Shao Yunan grabbed Wang Shijing\u2019s hair and pulled his head back, gasping, \u201cIf you don\u2019t come in again, don\u2019t touch me!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shao Yunan let go and then Wang Shijing\u2019s fingers reached towards Shao Yunan\u2019s back.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Shao Yunan pulled Wang Shijing\u2019s hair as their long hair tangled together in the water. \u201cAh\u2026\u201dOnce again his body felt the dull pain, but this time the dull pain was particularly long. Shao Yunan put his arms around Wang Shijing\u2019s neck and gave his body to him completely. He only felt that the process of being entered was unusually long. These five taels of meat were really hard to \u2018swallow.\u2019\u201cUmm, Um\u2026 Wife.\u201d\u201cSlow down.\u201d\u201cWife\u2026 Wife.\u201dWang Shijing bit Shao Yunan\u2019s lips, the tip of his tongue intruded into his mouth, sucking wildly. Then he pried open the body of the person in his arms little by little, savoring the soft warm honey trail, this was his wife, it was his Yunan. Clatter, clatter, the calm water made waves.\u201cAh!\u201d Shao Yunan\u2019s cry resounded throughout the space and Wang Shijing, who buried himself all the way in, no longer wanted to restrain his eagerness that he had held back for too long. He wanted to enjoy possessing this person, so he could say from the bottom of his heart that he was the wife of Wang Shijing. He knew he didn\u2019t deserve his wife and now, he was even more flustered.\u201cShijing, Shijing\u2026 slow down, slow down\u2026\u201d Wang Shijing carried Shao Yunan out of the pool and let him go. During this period, he still locked Shao Yunan\u2019s body in a firm grip, wrapping Shao Yunan\u2019s legs around his waist. While Wang Shijing\u2019s own waist moved violently like an out-of-control motor.Shao Yunan had no time to think about whether he had brought this on himself or asked for his own death. He only felt that he was about to be pierced by Wang Shijing. But the paradox was that he wrapped his limbs around Wang Shijing so hard and his emotional cries provoked another wave of desires in Wang Shijing, that was about to overwhelm him. They finally become married in the real sense.Vaguely he heard someone talking, but he couldn\u2019t hear properly, so Shao Yunan struggled to turn over in the quilt, pulled the quilt over his head, and then went to sleep. After a while, he seemed to be pushed, but he still ignored it due to his exhaustion. Then someone came to him, pulled down the quilt, wiped the beads of sweat from his forehead with his hands, and after wrapping him back in the quilt, he picked him up.\u201cHoney, drink some water.\u201d Shao Yunan opened his mouth subconsciously and sweet warm water entered his mouth, moistening his dry throat.\u201cWife, are you hungry?\u201d\u201cSleepy\u2026\u201d\u201cEat something before you rest.\u201d With a big yawn, the man in Wang Shijing\u2019s arms did not want to move and just mumbled, \u201cYour ex-wife must not be able to stand it and ran away.\u201d A chuckle passed to him through Wang Shijing\u2019s vibrating chest.\u201cI made porridge, have some porridge before you go to sleep.\u201d\u201cI want to eat noodles.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll cook it, just like last night?\u201d\u201cMm-hmm.\u201dShao Yunan was placed back on the bed and the person who made him so tired went out. After two yawns, Shao Yunan still had no intention to get up. This coquettish man, even he was not sure how many times they did it in the space yesterday. He even pressed him down twice after leaving the space. If it wasn\u2019t for his spiritual spring water, he wondered if he would have already been reincarnated by now.This coquettish man, had supposedly been afraid of hurting his body and had refused to eat it thoroughly. Now knowing of the existence of the spiritual spring water and essence, he had completely revealed his appetite and was no longer afraid of hurting him.Shao Yunan licked his lips, but there was no denying that the process of doing the \u2018complete set\u2019 was very enjoyable. The man who looked so honest was not dull at all in bed and had so many tricks, he suspected he had learned from his good brothers.With a sigh of relief, Shao Yunan stretched his taut body, as he became much more relaxed. Finally, he had someone responsible for the land in the space. The pile of supplies and the things he had stored that needed to be organized and which gave him a headache was also taken care of. But the main thing was that with his secret out, many things became much easier to do.Wang Shijing came back with a bowl of fragrant egg noodles in clear soup, with spiritual milk and spiritual spring water. Shao Yunan did not have to pay special attention to his diet after the night;s activities and just wanted to eat the simple noodles made by Wang Shijing. Wang Shijing cut the noodles finely and cooked them just right, so Shao Yunan liked them very much.There were not many men in the Wang family who could cook like Wang Shijing. People like Wang Tianyan and Wang Zhisong simply never entered the kitchen, but Wang Shijing\u2019s skills in making noodles were \u2018trained\u2019 by old lady Wang. Shao Yunan sat up and Wang Shijing hurriedly put a pillow behind him, dragged the kang table over with one hand, and put the bowl on it.\u201cWhat else do you want to eat?\u201d\u201cNoodles will be enough, what time is it? How is Qing?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the morning after. Qing is fine. His throat doesn\u2019t hurt and his chest isn\u2019t stuffy. Earlier this morning, old master Sun came and said that Qing was recovering well, but since he is in shock, he should stay at home for a few days to recuperate. The children asked what happened to you and I said you slept late last night.\u201dShao Yunan glared at the culprit. \u201cHow dare you say I slept late? The sun came up before I could go to sleep! Your ex-wife absolutely couldn\u2019t stand your stamina!\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s one eye was filled with satisfaction as he came closer and reached into the quilt to run his hand along Shao Yunan\u2019s waist. \u201cMy wife is too seductive. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d\u201cGet lost, obviously you are a beast! You say if you had any good brothers in the army!? You seem very used to spending nights with a man!\u201d Wang Shijing immediately said, \u201cI really didn\u2019t. Even if I saw people doing it, I didn\u2019t do it and just followed what I learned.\u201d Then it\u2019s all used on me, right? Shao Yunan grunted twice and lowered his head to eat the noodles. Wang Shijing knew that his wife had suffered, but did not regret it. When he held his wife, he really felt like this person was his, that he completely belonged to him.Halfway through the meal, when his stomach no longer felt empty, Shao Yunan asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in the village?\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s expression immediately became a little cold. \u201cThe patriarch opened an ancestral hall and the concerned people knelt all night, while the four children each received three cane hits. Their houses are also not allowed to participate in the clan rituals for a year.\u201dShao Yunan raised his eyebrows. \u201cIncluding Wang Zhisong?\u201d\u201cYes. Brother Shuping and brother Yuande told me when they came to see Qing. But I didn\u2019t ask about the rest.\u201d Wang Shijing clearly did not want to mention the people from that house.\u201cOld lady Wang was beaten with thirty boards, what do you plan to do?\u201d\u201cI took twenty taels of silver and asked Brother Shuping to send it over, so I won\u2019t need to go over. It is also up to them whether they want it or not. I asked Brother Shuping to convey to them that they should not look for me in the future and that the twenty taels of silver is my last act of filial respect.\u201dShao Yunan nodded. \u201cIf they are smart, they probably won\u2019t come to us again in the future. Luckily you didn\u2019t let Qing and Nizi enter the family tree. Let\u2019s see if we will have a chance to get you out of there as well, in the future.\u201d\u201cMm-hmm.\u201dAfter eating the noodles, Shao Yunan went to the toilet, took a bath, and went back to sleep. Today, many people came to their house to visit Wang Qing, but Wang Shijing did not disturb Shao Yunan. Yesterday\u2019s incident could be said to have shaken the entire village. Wang Shijing\u2019s family clearly had the county magistrate as a backer, so the families that previously bullied Wang Shijing were now afraid.Looking at old lady Wang\u2019s family situation was enough to keep them on their toes. Especially Wang Dafu\u2019s family that wanted to take advantage of Wang Shijing. On seeing him, they now went straight to hide, in fear that Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan would come to settle scores with them. Many families that previously were not close to Wang Shijing\u2019s family, tried to take the opportunity of checking on Wang Qing to get closer to them. However, they were sent off by Wang Shijing on the grounds that their children were frightened, so only those with a good relationship with their family could come.Wang Shijing sent some chrysanthemum tea to Uncle Zhou and Aunt Zhou\u2019s family, and also took ten taels of silver to thank them. The couple refused to accept any money, but were forced to do so by Wang Shijing. If Zhou Tianbao hadn\u2019t rescued Wang Qing in time, Shao Yunan would not have been able to help. Not to mention that it was not easy for Zhou Tianbao to have such a response at that time.Wang Shijing also let Zhao Yuande send five taels of silver to Tang Genshu\u2019s side as thanks. Since Tang Genshu\u2019s mother was a widow, it was inconvenient for Wang Shijing to visit them in person. Tang Genshu also refused to accept it, but Zhao Yuande said it would help him with his brother\u2019s studies. Then Tang Genshu thanked him several times and finally accepted.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wang Shijing also said that the children and his wife needed rest and declined the villagers who wanted to visit them. After this, Wang Qing studied harder and harder, and Wang Nizi also showed some changes. These changes were not a bad thing in Shao Yunan\u2019s eyes, so he didn\u2019t talk to them about it.During the day Wang Shijing would make an excuse to go out and then Shao Yunan would send him to work in the space, while Shao Yunan would stay outside. Wang Shijing attached great importance to these forty acres of land. By the standards of this place, they were not only so fertile that Wang Shijing had never seen anything like it before, but they could also be irrigated with spiritual spring water. According to Shao Yunan, no matter what was planted on this land, it would never be bad.Shao Yunan also said straight away that he wanted to grow tea and grapes. Wang Shijing set aside thirty acres to grow tea and grapes, and seven of the remaining ten acres to grow food and vegetables, while the rest could be used flexibly. He also planted some ordinary yellow chrysanthemums, golden chrysanthemums, red sour fruits, and other things. Shao Yunan had a lot of seeds in his storage, so he could plant some rare fruits and vegetables from it.There were also solar-powered plowing machines and planters in the space, which became Wang Shijing\u2019s favorite items. His wife was really a modern man from another world, thousands of years later! Wang Shijing felt that he didn\u2019t deserve his wife or anything that had happened to him. But he still wanted to know everything about his wife\u2019s earlier world, so even without Shao Yunan\u2019s urging, Wang Shijing was full of drive.When Wang Shijing was busy in the space, Shao Yunan was in the kitchen frying black sesame seeds. Before frying, he had already cleaned the black sesame seeds and was frying them when a knock on the door could be heard. Then Shao Yunan called, \u201cQing, come here for a moment.\u201dWang Qing quickly came over and Shao Yunan said, \u201cCome and help little father fry. Little father will check who came. Fry it till it\u2019s dry and fragrant.\u201d\u201cMmm!\u201dShao Yunan handed the spoon to Wang Qing and told him to be careful not to get burned. Then he quickly went out of the kitchen to open the door. As soon as he opened the door, Shao Yunan wrinkled his eyebrows, as if he had seen a dead cockroach at the bottom of the pot of his leftover soup.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Didn\u2019t Wang Shuping bring you the message?\u201d The people at the door were Wang Dali, Wang Zhisong, and Wang Chunxiu. Wang Zhisong, whose eyelids were still bruised and the corners of his mouth were broken, shrank back and lowered his head. \u201cBig, sister-in-law, we\u2019d like to meet my big brother.\u201d\u201cSister-in-law, we were wrong. Please forgive us.\u201d Wang Chunxiu was crying. Wang Dali\u2019s lips moved for a long time before he finally spoke, \u201cWe\u2019ve come to see little Qing.\u201d But Shao Yunan was only annoyed with these people. \u201cShijing went out and I thought Shijing had already made it clear. Originally, our two families did not need to deal with each other after the separation, but time after time you\u2019ve come to our door.\u201d\u201cNow Shijing also sent 20 taels of silver over and you already accepted it, but you still come calling big brother and sister-in-law. After so many things have happened, can a few words of forgiveness erase it completely? Besides, after that day\u2019s incident, not to mention that Qing and I do not feel well, but did you still want to come in? Don\u2019t be ridiculous. Who would believe it? You go back and live your own lives from now on.\u201d\u201cSister-in-law!\u201d Wang Zhisong knelt down with a bang and Wang Chunxiu also knelt down. Wang Dali, whose knees were weak, also wanted to kneel down but Shao Yunan held him and yelled, \u201cWhat are you doing? You\u2019re here to torment us, aren\u2019t you? Wang Zhisong, did you ask your father to kneel to me to compromise my life? What are you planning?\u201dSome of the neighbors came out and some of the other families who saw the commotion also came out. Shao Yunan really wanted to slap these three undead cockroaches. \u201cStand up, both of you or do you want another thirty slaps?\u201dWang Zhisong hurriedly stood up with a jolt and also dragged Wang Chunxiu up with him. Shao Yunan pointed with his hand and said with a cold expression, \u201cI am telling you directly. Forgiveness is not possible, so don\u2019t even try. If you wanted to apologize, you should have done that earlier. I already warned you that time at the county school. Wang Zhisong, you are just stupid. When things get to this point, it\u2019s all your own fault. If you have come to ask for forgiveness, please go back.\u201dWang Zhisong looked at his father with tearful eyes. Wang Dali\u2019s lips trembled as he uttered in a low voice, \u201cShijing, Shijing\u2019s family, me and my wife, bad, you, forgive Zhisong, this time. It\u2019s all our fault. Zhisong is, child student, student\u2026\u201dWang Zhisong pinched his clothes. \u201cSister-in-law, please plead with the county magistrate to not remove my child student status, so I can continue to study in the country school. I will certainly restrain my family and take good care of my mother and Zaizheng. Please.\u201d After saying that he was going to kneel again.Shao Yunan looked at him coldly. As soon as Wang Zhisong clenched his teeth and knelt down, Shao Yunan said coldly, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll plead for you.\u201d Wang Zhisong raised his head in surprise and even Wang Chenxiu stopped crying.\u201cI will plead for you, but you need to control your family. As long as you can do what is written in the deed from now on, both sides no longer have anything to do with each other. You want to take the exam, take it. As long as you do not mess with my family, it will all depend on your own ability. I, Shao Yunan, will definitely not trip you up behind your back, but if you are still unable to do this, then sorry.\u201d\u201cCan! I can! Thank you sister-in-law! Thank you sister-in-law!\u201d Wang Zhisong hurriedly kowtowed. \u201cYou also do not need to call me sister-in-law. Your family has long disowned your big brother. From now on, when we see each other you can call me by name. Our family ties were severed after your mother said she was going to sell Nizi and after your nephew wanted to kill Qing and Nizi.\u201dNo longer looking at the shaking Wang Dali, the pale Wang Zhisong and the disbelieving Wang Chunxiu, Shao Yunan nonchalantly closed the courtyard door. Wang Dali\u2019s body trembled badly as he looked at the closed courtyard door. Wang Zhisong after standing up, held him and biting his lips, pulled his father and sister away and went home.Some people who saw this scene with their own eyes shook their heads and sighed. They were originally a family, but they came to this point\u2026 Some people said that Shao Yunan had good intentions, but some still doubted it. Even if Wang Zhisong could keep his status as a child student, he will be greatly humiliated by the country magistrate. Would he be able to take the examination in the future? But no one dared to say it was Shao Yunan\u2019s fault. If someone accidentally spread it to other people\u2019s ears, they could be next\u2026 Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing, who had the county magistrate as a backer, were absolutely not people they dared to mess with.Shao Yunan went back to the kitchen to replace Wang Qing. Wang Qing tightened his little face and asked, \u201cLittle father, are you really going to plead with the county magistrate?\u201dShao Yunan said, \u201cYes, I will plead. Otherwise, they will come to our door every day and pretend to be pitiful. Once or twice is fine, but after a few more times, people will say that your little father is cold-hearted. Even Wang Dali\u2019s old man was going to kneel down for me. But even with or without the status of a child student, it doesn\u2019t make much difference.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you were an examiner and there was such a candidate, would you let him get his merit?\u201d Wang Qing immediately shook his head.\u201cNo matter which era, reputation is very important. Wang Zhisong is stupid, because he is too conceited. He studied just to get the title and enjoyed the vanity that studying brought him, but forgot that his future success is not determined by his success in the exam. As the saying goes, don\u2019t be afraid of a god-like opponent, but of a pig-like teammate.\u201d\u201cIf the other scholars are Wang Zhisong\u2019s opponents, then old lady Wang, Wang Tianyan, and Guo Zhaodi, including Wang Zaizheng, are his teammates who are dragging him down. But sadly, Wang Zhisong doesn\u2019t think like this. Even if he really can become a scholar in the future, as long as someone pokes out his family\u2019s affairs, his official cap will definitely be removed. So little Qing, god-like opponents are not scary\u2026 pig-like teammates are much scarier.\u201d Wang Qing nodded his head in understanding.\u201cYou can be friends with people of the three religions and nine personalities, but if you want to make deep friendships with them, you must keep your eyes open and observe carefully. Your family will not drag you down and will prevent the people around you from doing so. Our family is rich now. In the eyes of others, we have the county magistrate as a backer, so people who want to flatter you will come in waves. Don\u2019t be proud because of it and don\u2019t be blinded. Knowing only a person\u2019s face, but not his heart\u2026 only an arrow aimed at your back can truly hurt you, so be careful of whom you trust, okay?\u201d\u201cYes! Little father, I will be careful!\u201d While frying sesame seeds, Shao Yunan told Wang Qing a story and Wang Nizi also came to listen. Wang Qing looked at his little father and as he listened to the story, he felt a sudden longing in his heart, wanting to call his little father \u2018mother.\u2019Their courtyard was filled with the strong fragrance of sesame seeds and when the sesame oil and sesame paste were canned, Shao Yunan suddenly remembered that he seemed to have forgotten someone in the space. Rubbing his sore and limp arms, he rushed the two children, who were still intoxicated after listening to the story all afternoon, into the house and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to see why your father isn\u2019t back yet.\u201dThe two children went into the house obediently, while Shao Yunan hid in the kitchen. After locking the door, he hurriedly went into the space. A large area of the land in the space had been tilled and the Qimen black tea branches, wild chrysanthemums, and goat milk fruits that Shao Yunan threw in the space had already been planted. Wang Shijing had also planted the golden chrysanthemum seeds that Shao Yunan had in storage and planned to go up the mountain to cut some of the tea tree branches Shao Yunan wanted to plant, and then plant the grain and seed Shao Yunan had stored.The grain seeds in Shao Yunan\u2019s space were very good seeds. The bags of rice and noodles that he had stored were only for his own family to eat. The children only thought it was delicious and did not suspect where such exquisite rice and noodles came from. As soon as Shao Yunan came in, he saw Wang Shijing sweating and pouring water. He called, \u201cShijing, it\u2019s time to go out.\u201d Wang Shijing raised his head, he was shirtless and only wore a pair of shorts. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Wang Shijing put down the bucket and walked over to ask.\u201cIt\u2019s time to make dinner.\u201d Shao Yunan said. \u201cClean up and dress yourself before coming out, I will be in the kitchen.\u201d Wang Shijing peeled off his shorts and underwear (boxers), jumped into a small bathing pool to wash quickly, then went ashore and took the towel handed over by Shao Yunan to dry himself. After putting on a clean pair of boxers, he took a look at the clothes and towel Shao Yunan brought to him.Shao Yunan was not used to wearing ancient underwear, so after his space became exposed, he quickly switched to the modern one. Wang Shijing, who was not used to wearing briefs, reluctantly accepted the boxers. Once they came out of the space, Wang Shijing quickly dressed and then opened the door to look out. Seeing that the two children were in their own room with the door closed, he walked out softly, opened the courtyard door, and then forcefully closed it as he shouted, \u201cYunan, I\u2019m back, I\u2019m back.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d Shao Yunan came out from the kitchen and the two of them acted very realistically. \u201cFather, you\u2019re back.\u201d The two children also came out of their room. Wang Shijing responded and asked, \u201cYunan, what are we having for dinner?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s cold, so I stewed a pot of vegetables and meat, together with steamed buns. I also made sesame paste and sesame oil today, so you can eat them with the vegetables.\u201d Wang Nizi said, \u201cDad, the sesame paste and sesame oil made by my little father are very fragrant.\u201d\u201cMmm. Your little dad is the best.\u201d Wang Shijing went to the kitchen and pretended to wash his hands, while Wang Qing and Wang Nizi, stopped studying and went to the backyard to see their vegetable garden which had already been harvested twice. Since it was getting colder and colder, the vegetables were going to freeze soon. The water for the calf and the two sheep was filled with spiritual spring water, so they grew strong and ate a lot. Wang Qing and Wang Nizi knew that their little father bought the sheep so that they could drink milk.As soon as the two children left, Shao Yunan whispered to Wang Shijing about Wang Zhisong and the others\u2019 visit. Wang Shijing\u2019s expression immediately turned ugly, but Shao Yunan told him to not be angry. \u201cI have made it clear, so if they act stupid, they will die soon. Shijing, you go to Brother Jiang\u2019s tomorrow. Wang Zhisong is not someone we should be afraid of. He might hold the title of child student until he grows old, we are not so stingy. Wang Zaizheng told him thoroughly after all. If brother Jiang does not want to have an enemy in the future, he won\u2019t let him take the exam, so let\u2019s take this as a clean break. I was going to order some things, so you might as well come along. After moving, we have to buy a carriage. It\u2019s too cold and painful to ride on the ox-cart.\u201dWith Shao Yunan\u2019s persuasion, Wang Shijing was no longer upset. Shao Yunan wanted to order several sets of wooden tea trays, as well as packaging boxes, and decanters. He could make tea with the supplies he had, but it must be sold in special packaging, and he must first give some to the two great gods to taste. He should also match an appropriate tea set with it. Shao Yunan had some in the space but couldn\u2019t bear to take it out.After dinner, the husband and wife entered the space again after the children fell asleep. Wang Shijing asked Shao Yunan who he intended to give the sesame oil and sesame sauce to. This sesame oil was fragrant and the sesame sauce when paired with Shao Yunan\u2019s spicy dish was also absolutely delicious. Shao Yunan said, \u201cLet\u2019s take a look at it first. I don\u2019t think Wang Shuping can afford it, because the Wang clan has so many internal problems. It\u2019s not known if Wang Wenhe can also keep his position as patriarch and to produce this in large quantities, requires some professional tools. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll make two snacks tomorrow night, so call fourth aunt\u2019s family and Wang Zhuanghua\u2019s family over.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Wang Shijing went to fourth Aunt\u2019s house the next day after breakfast to borrow their ox cart and also told her to come over for dinner that evening. Then he went to see Wang Zhuanghua\u2019s family. When Wang Shijing finally arrived at the town, he first visited Jiang Kangning and after relaying Shao Yunan\u2019s intention, he also agreed to let Wang Zhisong retain his child student status. But Jiang Kangning also bluntly said that he would not recruit an enemy for himself and with Wang Zhisong\u2019s current reputation, his path of studying was already ruined.The imperial court needed to make some adjustments to the current imperial examinations and should have stricter requirements for the character of students who wanted to take imperial examination and their family background. The students participating in the examinations also needed a letter of recommendation from the local \u2018school master,\u2019 that would guarantee that his character was good, had a clean family history, and there were no criminals in the family. If the investigation was not true, not only will the student be imprisoned for three months, he will no longer be allowed to participate in any examination and the local \u2018school teacher\u2019 who wrote his recommendation letter would also be implicated and punished.The emperor wanted to rectify the administration of the officials. Coupled with the current court officials\u2019 dissatisfaction, they came up with these laws. Although the law was too biased, most of the people who had the status of \u2018school master\u2019 are knowledgeable and upright scholars, and most of them are from the Imperial College. The emperor also believed in their character, so after adding the recommendation letter barrier, he believed that the people selected by the court to participate in the imperial examinations, were more trustworthy and eliminated future corruption. There were already enough corrupt officials who took bribes and behaved badly.There were only two people in Yongxiu County with the title of \u2018school master.\u2019 One was Dean Cen and the other was the master of White Moon Academy, who was also one of Dean Cen\u2019s students from the Imperial College in the capital. After a few years as an official, he was discouraged by the darkness of officialdom and resigned his posr to return to his hometown to teach.After returning to his hometown, Dean Cen opened the White Moon Academy and invited him to be a teacher as well as his assistant. Later, Dean Cen stepped down as the dean and this man became dean of the school. The capital later awarded him with the title of \u2018School master.\u2019 This title could be awarded only by the Imperial Academy after reviewing all the deans of schools, which was also one of the reasons the Emperor came up with this method. Old Master Weng, who was the dean of the Imperial Academy, was also the emperor\u2019s teacher and if the emperor had a crown prince, he would also probably become the prince\u2019s teacher, which was enough to show the emperor\u2019s trust in him.This edict has not yet been officially issued, but the news had already spread from the Imperial Academy in the capital, so people like Jiang Kangning had naturally already received the news. As for whether this edict will continue, it was not easy to say, but it seemed that within ten years it wouldn\u2019t change. In the case of Wang Zhisong\u2019s current status and the reputation of the Wang family he definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to receive a recommendation letter from the School master.In this regard, Wang Shijing didn\u2019t gloat. Even if Shao Yunan did not go to the county school to make a mess, it seemed that Wang Zhisong still wouldn\u2019t have the opportunity to take the imperial examination. If someone wanted to write him a recommendation letter he was bound to do an investigation. He also didn\u2019t believe that Dean Cen and other School masters would allow a person like Wang Zhisong to participate in the examination.Edited by: JaislandProofreader:Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fierce \u201cHusband\u201dCH 46.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 46.1Wang Shijing took out a long list of orders written by Shao Yunan to buy goods, before leaving the county town\u2019s Yamen. Shao Yunan wanted the tea tray to be made according to the pattern he drew himself, so Wang Shijing went to the same store where he ordered the wine barrel before. When the shopkeeper saw the pattern, he was very impressed and begged Wang Shijing not to go to another shop.Wang Shijing, who had learned a little about business from Shao Yunan, ordered 30 tea sets and requested that the tea bowls be made from white porcelain. The shopkeeper gave the cheapest price and also came with two sets. Wang Shijing then said that if they still need more in the future, he would definitely come back to the shopkeeper to order more. But before his family could make use of these tea sets, the\u00a0 shopkeeper was not allowed to present it to any other families, otherwise their order would be void.Most shopkeepers wouldn\u2019t know the use of the tea sets or the other things ordered by Wang Shijing, especially the decanter. Wang Shijing didn\u2019t say it was a decanter. He only said that it had a special purpose. Although the shopkeeper did not know the origin of the tea sets, he could see that Wang Shijing would definitely want them in large quantities later, so he signed the contract at once. The new style of wine barrel allowed him to earn a lot of money. He didn\u2019t know the use of the tea set for now, but he was sure that it would allow him to earn a lot of money later and would also sell well. It could be said that this shopkeeper had a very economic mind.After taking care of business, Wang Shijing bought the meat and glutinous rice that Shao Yunan ordered before going back. Just as he returned and entered the door, he smelled a strong smell of meat as someone dared to test him. \u201cShijing, what kind of delicious food did your wife make? We have been craving it for half a day.\u201dWang Shijing, who had returned the cart, was carrying the meat with one hand and the rice bag with the other, as he replied. \u201cIt must be meat, my Yunan said he would make something delicious for Qing and Nizi today.\u201d\u201cQing and Nizi are lucky to have such a little father. Shijing, you are also a very lucky man.\u201d\u201cWell, my Yunan is the best. Qing and Nizi are also close to their little father.\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s response made many of the villagers around him less afraid of him. If they were afraid of the scars on Wang Shijing\u2019s face before, now they were afraid of the mountain behind Wang Shijing.As soon as he entered the courtyard, Wang Shijing called, \u201cYunan I am back! What are you cooking?\u201d The two children come out of the kitchen, the corners of their mouths dripping with gravy. Their eyes shone as Wang Nizi shouted, \u201cFather, little father stewed meat! It\u2019s especially fragrant.\u201d\u201cWell daddy can smell it.\u201d Carrying the meat and rice into the kitchen, before Wang Shijing could ask, a piece of meat was fed to his mouth, making him hastily open his mouth.\u201cMmm! So good!\u201d Shao Yunan said, \u201cIt has to be stewed more, until it is soft and tender. But I scooped some to make braised meat rice. The rice also needs to be steamed, so wash your hands and rest for a while.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not tired. What else needs to be done?\u201d\u201cNothing more. I want you to make bread tonight.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d The two children didn\u2019t lift their heads while they were eating, but Shao Yunan just shook his head when he saw them.. They had already eaten it a few times, so how come they still loved it so much?Wang Shijing didn\u2019t say anything about going to the county town and just also took a big mouthful of food. The rice Shao Yunan cooked was the one from the space, so it was very fragrant. This made the two children think that the rice today was particularly delicious, but could not think of the reason why the rice tasted so different.When the two children went to take a nap after their meal, Wang Shijing repeated what Jiang Kangning told him to Shao Yunan. Shao Yunan finally said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to do evil, but you can\u2019t live long by doing it yourself.\u201dIn the afternoon, Wang Shijing went to their new house, instead of going to the space. Since Wang Qing\u2019s accident, everyone understood why he hadn\u2019t shown up for the past few days, so as soon as they saw him, they all asked him about Wang Qing\u2019s situation. Wang Shijing told everyone that the child was well and thanked them for thinking about him. Wang Shijing did not cover his workers\u2019 food and housing, but he still bought a large piece of meat over, so they could add it to their evening meal. Since the days were getting colder, it could be considered a thank you to these people who worked without delay.After strolling around the new house, picking out a few problems, and chatting with Father Wang and Uncle Zhou about the new house for a while, Wang Shijing finally went up the mountain and found the tea tree forest that he and Shao Yunan spent 600 taels of silver to buy. Jiang Kangning directly asked about this matter, since the Yamen division who came over to measure the land told him that Shao Yunan had directly signed the land deed on the same day. Although the village head also had to registrate the deed, he didn\u2019t spread it to the public and the Yamen also didn\u2019t spread it, so no one in the village knew that Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing had spent 600 taels of silver to buy a large piece of the mountain. From now on, the western mountain near the village belonged to Shao Yunan, since the land deed was written in Shao Yunan\u2019s name.Wang Shijing took out a large gourd of spiritual spring water from his back basket and began to water the trees. He brought a total of four large gourds, so each tree was watered once before he cut five branches from each tree. He then picked up the back basket and left. These old tea trees have grown here for a hundred years or even a thousand years, so Shao Yunan didn\u2019t intend to move them. As long as he has some branches, the seeds will be sown in the space to sprout. If nothing else, the old tea branches in the space should grow into large trees in a year.When passing by the withered goat\u2019s milk fruits forest, Wang Shijing also dug up a dozen of them. These dozen goat\u2019s milk fruit trees can be grown into hundreds of trees. Shao Yunan patted his chest to guarantee the quality of his tea, but the best wine would also be produced in his space.When he got home, Shao Yunan planted the cut branches in the space, while Wang Shijing was busy making bread. Wang Shijing kneaded the bread under Shao Yunan\u2019s guidance and baked it on the side of a large iron pot. After baking, it was placed on the stove top to stay warm. After the first batch was made, Shao Yunan scooped out a spoonful of meat and chopped it on the counter. Cutting the buns from the side, he put the meat inside and then poured a little soup over it, making Wang Shijing swallow his saliva.\u201cNizi, Qing come.\u201d\u201cComing.\u201d Wang Qing and Wang Nizi ran out from their room and Shao Yunan handed the meat sandwich to Wang Nizi. \u201cTry it, be careful and don\u2019t drip the grease on your clothes.\u201d Wang Nizi opened her mouth to take a bite and instantly, her eyes went wide open. \u201cUh-huh!\u201d Yummy!Shao Yunan quickly made the second one and handed it to Wang Qing, who was already gulping on the side. Then Wang Qing opened his mouth to take a big bite. Wang Shijing looked at his wife with his one eye, but Shao Yunan made the third one for himself as he squinted his eyes in satisfaction\u2026 \u201cDelicious.\u201d\u201cWife\u2026.\u201d\u201cHeh.\u201d Bullying people felt good, Shao Yunan teased, \u201cIf this bread is baked well, I will reward you with a bite.\u201d\u00a0Wang Shijing\u2019s mouth opened and half of the sandwich was gone, but he had a very satisfied expression in his eyes.\u201cLittle father, it\u2019s so delicious!\u201d\u201cLittle father is not delicious.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Wang Nizi blushed and Wang Qing laughed.The two children finished eating, licking the gravy running down their fingers. Shao Yunan, who only ate one bite, fed the rest to Wang Shijing, then asked, \u201cHow about this? Can we give this to fourth aunt\u2019s family and others to sell?\u201dEdited by: JaislandPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Only then did Wang Shijing answer Shao Yunan\u2019s question. \u201cI can do it. Do you really want to give it to fourth aunt\u2019s family?\u201d\u201cMm. Haven\u2019t I already talked to Boss Xu? Fourth aunt and Wang Zhuanghua will open a small stall outside Yizhang Xuan restaurant. This way Yizhang Xuan restaurant can protect them, while they can give Yizhang Xuan restaurant additional business, it\u2019s mutually beneficial. Help me wash the dishes later. I will make skewers tonight. Let\u2019s see how these two families will want to share these snacks.\u201dWang Shijing bent down and kissed his wife on the cheek. \u201cThanks for your trouble.\u201d This were all his favors, but they were all returned by his wife. Shao Yunan glared at him. \u201cCrazy, hurry up and work!\u201d Wang Shijing hurried to bake more bread.In the evening,\u00a0fourth aunt Wang\u2019s family and Wang Zhuanghua, together with his two fathers, a total of six people, arrived at Wang Shijing\u2019s house just in time. The Sun family\u2019s chrysanthemum tea has made a lot of money and now that the chrysanthemums were wilting, they could still smell it. Fourth aunt Wang\u2019s family and Wang Zhuanghua\u2019s two fathers, Wang Duoqiu and Li Shuyin, could not help being envious. But Wang Shijing already told them that he would give them a way to make money after the farming season ended, plus many things had happened in their clan, so they were too embarrassed to ask again. Today, Wang Shijing invited them to come over for dinner, so they had high hopes.As soon as Wang Xing and Wang Zhuanghua entered the courtyard, they shouted, \u201cWhat are you cooking again? People outside said they smelled meat all day.\u201d\u201cYou will know when you eat it later?\u201d Shao Yunan smiled and brought everyone to Wang Qing and Wang Nizi\u2019s room, where a big kang table was set up on the kang.Wang Shijing brought in a large pot of fragrant millet porridge from this year\u2019s rice. While Wang Qing was carrying a plate of shredded potatoes in vinegar. The tableware and chopsticks were already set. Wang Xing and Wang Zhuanghua were going to help, but were stopped by Shao Yunan. Shao Yunan held Wang Nizi and did not let her work. Fourth aunt Wang saw Wang Nizi\u2019s flushed little face, with a smile. She was all clean, with small white jade earrings in her ears and seemed to be enjoying the blessing as she smiled sweetly in her nest in Shao Yunan arms. Fourth aunt Wang was sincerely happy that Wang Shijing had found such a good wife and mother (small father) for his kids. After Wang Shijing remarried, she was worried that the two children would have more bad days in the future, but now not to mention worry, many children in the village envied them.Wang Shijing and Wang Qing came in again, this time, Wang Shijing had a large pot in his hand. Inside there were pre-made meat sandwiches. Seeing them, Wang Xing and Wang Zhuanghua began to swallow. \u201cBrother, what is this? It smells so good!\u201d\u201cLook at you two.\u201d Fourth aunt Wang slapped each of them. Wang Qing put a small stove in the middle of the table and lit the fire while Wang Shijing went out again. Wang Qing got on the bed and sat next to his little father. Fourth aunt Wang couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cYunan, look how much Qing and Nizi like you. You and Shijing need to put more effort in giving them both a brother or a sister.\u201dWang Qing and Wang Nizi immediately looked at their little father, pursing their lips a little. Without looking at their expressions, Shao Yunan said, \u201cQing and Nizi are already enough, I don\u2019t need any more.\u201d Fourth aunt Wang was surprised. \u201cYou don\u2019t want children?\u201d She looked at Wang Qing and Wang Nizi thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s not because of these two children, right?Wang Qing bit his lips. \u201cLittle father, if we have a younger brother or sister, Nizi and I will take care of them.\u201d Is it because of him and Nizi? Shao Yunan\u2019s head began to hurt as he shook his head violently. \u201cI\u2019ve agreed with Shijing to not have children. There are already ready-made ones at home, so I would be crazy to ask for more.\u201dFourth aunt Wang, \u201c\u2026?\u201d What does it mean? Wang Qing and Wang Nizi also stared at their little father, while Wang Shijing came in with a small iron pot. Fourth aunt Wang asked, \u201cShijing, you and Yunan don\u2019t want more children?\u201dWang Shijing put the iron pot on the small stove and only then said, \u201cYunan is afraid of pain. Whether it\u2019s a man or a woman, giving birth is painful so if he doesn\u2019t want it, he doesn\u2019t need to do it.\u201d\u201cLittle father\u2026\u201d Wang Qing tugged at his little father\u2019s clothes. Shao Yunan gave the back of his head a gentle slap. \u201cChildren don\u2019t need to think about such heavy topics. Even without you and Nizi, I wouldn\u2019t give birth. I am too afraid of pain and don\u2019t like big bellies.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Everyone.Fourth aunt Wang, \u201cHow could childbirth not hurt?\u201dShao Yunan, \u201cAnyway Shijing already has children, so I don\u2019t need to suffer this kind of pain. Fourth aunt, let\u2019s eat. Don\u2019t try to persuade me anymore. I won\u2019t have a baby. I am very determined not to have a baby.\u201dWang Xing and Wang Zhuanghua stifled their laughter, as fourth aunt Wang helplessly shook her head, but also laughed. However,\u00a0 the most vocal was Li Shuyin\u2019s voice. \u201cYou two have agreed. After I gave birth to Zhuanghua, your aunt no longer persuaded me. It\u2019s indeed painful to give birth.\u201dShao Yunan picked up his chopsticks, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about giving birth anymore, come and eat. This is called\u00a0 \u2018Bai Ji Bun\u2019. To put it simply, it is called a meat sandwich. This one is called a skewer and despite its spicy taste, it\u2019s very addictive to eat. It should be eaten together, but since I didn\u2019t have bamboo sticks at home I didn\u2019t dare to cook it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really fragrant!\u201dWang Xing and Wang Zhuanghua stretched out their hands to take one meat bun each, while Wang Shijing distributed one to fourth aunt and uncle, as well as Wang Zhuanghua\u2019s parents, Wang Duoqiu and Li Shuyin. The meat bun was so good that even the most reserved fourth aunt Wang couldn\u2019t stop talking about it. A layer of white sesame seeds floated in the sizzling soup, which was soaked with sliced meat and vegetables, like potatoes, mushrooms, etc\u2026After that, no one spoke. Everyone held their Bai Ji Bun in their left hand and stretched their chopsticks into the hot pot with their right hand. Shao Yunan didn\u2019t let Wang Qing and Wang Nizi eat too much spicy food, so the plate of shredded potatoes with vinegar was just for them. The two children eagerly looked at the dish in the red pot, although they loved the shredded potatoes in vinegar, they still wanted to eat more of it.When all the meat buns and the food in the red pot were finished, Wang Shijing picked up the red pot while Shao Yunan extinguished the fire before he spoke. \u201cFourth uncle, fourth aunt, Uncle Duoqiu, uncle Shuyin, do you think this meat bun and skewers can be sold?\u201d The two families froze, then became ecstatic, all nodding their heads vigorously.Shao Yunan said, \u201cNow that the clan is unstable, if I took out a big money-making recipe, I am afraid I would only make a bigger uproar in the clan. Not to mention uncle and aunt, Wang Xing and Wang Zhuanghua are Wang Shijing\u2019s good brothers. It\u2019s only right that when one brother has a good life, he will think about his other brother. Now that it\u2019s no longer so busy and these two foods can be sold even if it\u2019s cold or warmed up quickly\u2026\u201d\u201cThis business is just a small business, so if others eye it they will think it\u2019s not good enough to grab, so I can also avoid giving you unnecessary trouble. I have already talked to the boss of the\u00a0Yizhang Xuan restaurant. You can set up a stall at the entrance of Yizhang Xuan and use their source of customers to attract business. If you are tired, you can also close the stall. If you rent a store you will lose a day\u2019s rent, but if you do rent a store you should consider directly buying it if you decide to open a store later.\u201d\u201cYunan, this, this\u2026\u201d Fourth aunt wiped the corner of her eyes not knowing what to say. Uncle Shuyin said in an unsteady voice, \u201cThank you, Shijing, Yunan. We didn\u2019t help you much, so you guys doing this\u2026 it\u2019s really a great kindness.\u201d\u201cUncle don\u2019t say it. The help you gave our family was a blessing in disguise. The meat in this meat bun has to be stewed well. The key to making it is the ingredients. The key to this skewer is this pot of soup, it has the same key ingredients. The meat bun, stewed meat, and skewer all match the soup ingredients, so matching this style of dishes is not simple. What we eat today is not rich enough, and there is also tofu, chicken, duck, fish, pig, pig blood\u2026 many things can be used. These two kinds of snacks look simple, but they still take a lot of work. The two of you go back and discuss what to do first. After the discussion, I will hand over the recipe to you individually, and teach you how to make them.\u201d\u201cHey! Hey!\u201d Fourth aunt smiled. Uncle Duoqiu said, \u201cWe will discuss it when we go back, Yunan and Shijing, sorry for the trouble.\u201d\u201cNot at all. Our family is doing well, so Shijing and I want fourth uncle and aunt, uncle Duoqiu and Shuyin, to also do well. When we earn money, we will send our children to study.\u201d\u201cHey!\u201d\u00a0Both Wang Xing and Wang Zhuanghua had families and children, who were about the same age as Wang Qing. Who would not want to make money and send their children to study? They did not want to let them be like others who will spend their whole lives as simple farmers.The four people who had enough to eat, left with gratitude, while Wang Qing and Wang Nizi took advantage of their little father\u2019s inattention and tried the soup in the red pot with their chopsticks. So when Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing came back, they saw two children \u2018eating.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s spicy, so if you eat too much you will have diarrhea. Little father will make you bubble tea to drink later. Next time, little father will make a less spicy one, so when you grow up you will have a strong stomach and can eat a lot.\u201d\u201cLittle father, won\u2019t this taste better with sesame sauce?\u201d Wang Nizi asked. \u201cIt will. But the sesame sauce can\u2019t be seen by others yet, so let\u2019s eat it by ourselves.\u201d\u201cHmm, got it.\u201d Wang Qing and Wang Nizi would rarely talk about what was going on at home to the outside world, especially about the new food that their little father made. The two children were very tight-lipped about it.After packing up, Wang Shijing left the soup in the red pot, to cook a pot of fresh vegetables in it the next day. Wang Shijing was making tea in the house and when he entered the room, he saw the two children sitting beside Shao Yunan, drinking tea. Wang Shijing felt a burst of warmth in his heart. Closing the door, he went over after taking off his shoes and received a fragrant Longjing tea from his wife\u2019s hands.Nizi, \u201cDad, why is that Tang monk always so stupid?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s called the compassion of the monks.\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t like it.\u201dWang Qing, \u201cLittle father, what happened later?\u201d\u201cLater? Later after drinking tea you should go to sleep. You shouldn\u2019t drink any more unless you don\u2019t want to sleep.\u201d\u201cLittle father\u2026\u201dAfter digesting their food, Wang Qing and Wang Nizi went to sleep. Wang Shijing then took Shao Yunan back to their room and asked to go into the space. Shao Yunan hugged Wang Shijing and the two entered the space, but before he could react, a hand ripped open his clothes.\u201cI thought you were coming in to work.\u201d Shao Yunan held down the lustful hand. \u201cI missed you.\u201d Pressing the man to the ground, Wang Shijing began his second big meal that night.Edited by: JaislandPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shao Yunan had not yet gotten up, so they felt very apologetic when they realized that they had come too early. Wang Shijing, who was already up, took them to Wang Qing and Wang Nizi\u2019s room, only saying that since it became colder, Shao Yunan liked to stay in bed a little longer. All of them were experienced people, so it was not like they couldn\u2019t understand the real reason why Shao Yunan was bedridden.Not letting them have time to be embarrassed, Wang Shijing directly asked them if they had discussed it. When the two families went back last night they had time for discussion. Fourth uncle and aunt decided to make the skewers, while uncle Duoqiu and uncle Shuyin would make \u2018Bai Ji Bun,\u2019 otherwise called a meat sandwich. Wang Shijing gave the recipe that Shao Yunan had already written to both families respectively. This was also to avoid both sides knowing each other\u2019s recipe and having suspicion about the details later. The two families\u2019 stalls would be set up together and Wang Shijing gave them a detailed account of the stall style Shao Yunan had designed for them.Both families\u2019 stalls wouldn\u2019t be too big and the meat sandwiches could be made the day before and just warmed up on the stove before serving it. This was why the meat sandwich stall should come with a small cylindrical stove. In Shao Yunan\u2019s opinion, they should start selling every day in the afternoon so they could prepare the food at home in the morning, then go to the country town directly after eating lunch. But if they also wanted to sell in the morning, they would need to get up very early. When it\u2019s cold, the meat should also be stewed the day before, but when it\u2019s hot, it has to be stewed on the same day or it would go bad fast. But the stall opening time should be decided by fourth aunt and the uncles themselves.The soup for the skewers should also be boiled for a while and those who bought it could eat it at the stall or bring their own food boxes. In cold weather, the soup base did not need to be changed every day and the more it was cooked, the more fragrant it would become. When it was packed, a little soup should\u00a0 also be included for the buyer to bring back with them. In other words, there was still some prep work to be done, before the stall could open. Buying ingredients, making a movable stove, and preparing a lot of bamboo sticks, as well as other materials.It was cold and there weren\u2019t many fresh vegetables available, so Wang Shijing provided fourth aunt\u2019s family with a lot of fungus and dried mushrooms. After fourth aunt\u2019s family made some money, it was okay to pay him the cost, so Wang Shijing also lent the two families 10 taels of silver each, since the meat was expensive and both foods required it.Wang Shijing also suggested that they partner up to buy a pig, making both families not know how to thank Wang Shijing. They said they would pay for the recipe when they earned money. Wang Shijing only asked for ten taels of silver as he wrote the contract, but both families insisted on giving 20% of the profits to Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan. However, Wang Shijing refused, saying that it was only a small business and could not be compared to chrysanthemum tea and jam. After getting the recipe, the deed, and borrowing 10 taels of silver, the two families were even more grateful and fourth aunt Wang even frequently cried.In the afternoon, Shao Yunan went to fourth aunt\u2019s house after a good rest and taught her how to cook the soup base for the skewers, how many ingredients could be used for a skewer, and how to set the price. The base spices must be ground into powder and put on the skewers. Shao Yunan also wrote a list of ingredients that can be used to make the soup, so that fourth aunt Wang would have some understanding of it.After teaching fourth aunt Wang, Shao Yunan went to Wang Zhuanghua\u2019s house to instruct uncle Duoqiu and uncle Shuyin on how to cook the meat. The bread was easy to make, so uncle Shuyin could do it after seeing Wang Shijing demonstrate it once. But the key ingredient of this dish was the meat, so uncle Duoqiu and uncle Shuyin both watched as the ingredients were ground into powder and put directly into the broth.The two families went to Wang Shijing\u2019s house and then Shao Yunan went to both families\u2019 houses, after which both houses gave off an alluring smell. The clever people immediately guessed what was going on, but the villagers did not dare to ask Shao Yunan. After some word of mouth, fourth aunt Wang directly said that Shao Yunan had taught both families how to make unique snacks and that they were going to set up a stall in the country town. But snacks could not be compared with something like jam or chrysanthemum tea, so everyone didn\u2019t ask for more.After getting some news from fourth aunt Wang, someone else ran to Wang Zhuanghua\u2019s house, but uncle Duoqiu and uncle Shuyin were both men, so they only smiled while Wang Zhuanghua\u2019s wife was very powerful and just with a few words drove the prying people out. This could also be called being a good person will be rewarded. But when you aren\u2019t a good person, when the time comes you can only show shameful expressions.This incident spread rapidly in the Wang clan, immediately making the clan members scold Wang Dafu\u2019s family. If they were not so shameless before, Shao Yunan would have already given their Wang clan a good way to make money. Some people also went to the patriarch, Wang Wenhe, hoping that Wang Wenhe could step in and go to Shao Yunan. After seeing that the Zhao and Sun clans were earning money, fourth uncle\u2019s family and Wang Duoqiu\u2019s family clearly wanted to do it alone, while the rest of the Wang clan was on the sidelines.After that day\u2019s incident, Wang Wenhe\u2019s health has not been very good. Since his heart was worried, how could he have a healthy body? Wang Wenhe only felt that he was a failure as the patriarch. They were so protective of old lady Wang\u2019s family, because he was hopeful that Wang Zhisong would achieve success and carry the clan. But that family\u2019s actions was getting more and more disheartening to him, even the young Wang Zaizheng dared to try to kill someone, so how could he not be sad?Wang Wenhe wanted to push his son Wang Shiping to the position of patriarch, but Wang Shiping was too young. Now his family\u2019s status in the clan was also delicate, as the three other clan elders have criticized him quite a bit, while the clan people had various opinions on him.Wang Shuping blocked these people out. It was not like Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan did not help the clan, just look at fourth uncle and uncle Duoqiu\u2019s family. When Wang Shijing was not at home, these two families took care of Wang Qing and Wang Nizi in private and when Wang Shijing came back, they still helped him. But now that Wang Shijing was repaying them, everyone was jealous. You reap what you sow. Let\u2019s not mention that the patriarch did not do the right things. How many people of the Wang clan did a good job? Just when they saw other people making money, they were jealous and they came to ask for a handout. But when they saw others eat meat, they still couldn\u2019t even drink the soup.His father was sick, but he finally let go of his expectations for Wang Zhisong, making Wang Shuping\u2019s attitude immediately become a lot tougher. Wang Zhisong\u2019s status as a child student might be saved, but Wang Shiping still did not mention that family. What he wanted to do now was to protect his own small family.When Wang Zaizheng was punished according to the clan rules after returning home, he was almost beaten to death by his uncle and aunt. After Wang Shijing\u2019s anger, the county magistrate\u2019s interrogation, the punishment of the clan, and the beating, Wang Zaizheng looked just like Wang Nizi in the past. Old lady Wang was now bedridden after receiving thirty boards and although she did not kneel overnight, she still lay in the ancestral hall overnight while injured, which made her sick. The twenty taels of silver that Wang Shijing brought to her was all spent to treat her injuries and get medical attention. Even though she was dying, she was still in bed, cursing Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan, Wang Zaizheng who caused the trouble, and patriarch Wang Wenhe who didn\u2019t care about them.After that day, Wang Zhisong\u2019s whole life has become quite gloomy. His father could not be trusted, his mother was dying, his sister didn\u2019t have a young lady\u2019s life, but a young lady\u2019s temper, as she couldn\u2019t cook or wash clothes well. Wang Zaizheng was so young, but already caused so much trouble, while his second brother and sister-in-law were in jail and he was not sure if they were still alive. For the first time, Wang Zhisong was so disgusted with his family. No one was helping him, but they still held him back. Just like this,Wang Zhisong counted all the faults on his family, except himself.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shao Yunan held a stone hammer in his hand and every time he raised it, Wang Nizi would turn the steamed glutinous rice in the stone mortar. Neither of them moved too fast, but Wang Nizi was laughing and smiling, while Wang Qing was reading in his room. He now knew many words, plus his little father gave him lessons and told him stories every day, so Wang Qing had already started to read the enlightenment books written with notes by teacher Guan and teacher Chen.Wang Shijing was at the new house, as he gave Tang Genshu and Zhou Tianbao full authority over the fields. Zhou Tianbao was silly, but he has no problem with farming. With Tang Genshu leading him, the two of them had no difficulty with taking care of Wang Shijing\u2019s 30 acres of land. Wang Shijing\u2019s land was also near the mountain spring, so watering it was very easy.The two of them just needed to hoe the weeds and regularly water it, with a pay of 30 copper coins a day for their work. With the help of the Sun clan\u2019s patriarch and Zhao Lizheng, coupled with the regular pay from Wang Shijing, Tang Genshu could now not only ensure his family\u2019s livelihood, but also save money for his brother\u2019s private schooling and could even buy some land in two years.Someone knocked on the door and Shao Yunan put down the stone hammer to open the door. Zhao He, together with his son Zhao Congbo, was outside the door. The two of them were holding a clay pot in their hands. Shao Yunan let them in and said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m making mochi. Brother He, please help me if it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cMochi? What kind of rare food are you making again? It\u2019s fine, Zhao Congbo and I came to see Wang Qing and Wang Nizi. We also brought you some red dates, ginger ham, and hawthorn jam, so you can see if it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cThen you can help me make mochi and we will eat together at my house at noon. Later, ask little Congbo to call brother Yuande, and Zhao Yuanqing and his wife over.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhao He was not polite to Shao Yunan and directly followed him to the kitchen. Shao Yunan let Wang Nizi wash her hands, while Zhao Cangbo politely greeted \u201cuncle Shao.\u201d After Wang Nizi finished washing her hands, he went with her to another room with her, while Shao Yunan let Wang Qing make red dates and wolfberry chrysanthemum tea to entertain the guests.Zhao He washed his hands and asked Shao Yunan what he wanted him to do, then he took the stone hammer from Shao Yunan\u2019s hands and let Shao Yunan turn the glutinous rice, since he was stronger than Shao Yunan. Shao Yunan looked over at the mochi and asked, \u201cWhen will you be ready to make the red date jam and hawthorn jam?\u201dZhao He said, \u201cWe\u2019ll start next month, since we have already signed the contract with boss Xu. I came here today to let you check how good it is.\u201d Shao Yunan asked, \u201cWe will try it with the mochi when they are ready. Has your clan been distributed?\u201d\u201cYes, but after Father and Yuande stepped in and no one dares to make trouble. Father told me to concentrate on making the jam and said I shouldn\u2019t worry about anything else. My father and Little Father are helping me now, too.\u201d Zhao He showed a rare smile as he whispered, \u201cFather and mother gave Zhao Yuande and Zhao Yuanqing 10% of the profit each, which could be considered their family\u2019s private property. Father said that after the New Year, he will let Zhao Yuande and Zhao Yuanqing separate.\u201d\u201cSince the family had a business now, father became afraid that the two brothers would develop a conflict over time, so it\u2019s better to separate while the family is still harmonious. Father and mother will stay with me and Yuande, while Zhao Yuanqing will live alone with his wife. Zhao Yuanqing also agreed. Father said that after separation, Yuande and I can still have our own private property, as he and mother will not ask about it.\u201d\u201cHe also said that he and mother would cover Cangbo and Yuanqing\u2019s childrens\u2019 study expenses. Then it would not only be the tuition fee, but also the money for future examinations. Shao Yunan gave a thumbs up. \u201cUncle and Aunt Zhao are very wise, your life in the future will be only more comfortable.\u201dZhao He said gratefully, \u201cIt\u2019s all because of you. If you hadn\u2019t taught me how to make jam, my father and mother would still be complaining that I only gave birth to Cangbo.\u201d With a relieved smile, Zhao He said, \u201cIn the past, I was also anxious. I wanted to give Zhao Yuande more children, but I just couldn\u2019t get pregnant. After giving birth to Cangbo, master Sun said it would be difficult for me to conceive in the future. But I am content now. Cangbo is good and Yuande is good to me, so I am satisfied. His parents now also treat me like their own son, so I have no regrets.\u201dShao Yunan laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s because Uncle Zhao and Aunt Zhao realized that only when there is harmony in the family, that everything can flourish. Neither you nor Li Caijuan are people who care about things. Brother Yuande and Yuanqing are not only brothers, but also good friends and having children can\u2019t be forced. Instead of looking forward to having more grandchildren, it\u2019s better to cultivate your existing grandson. I think little Cangbo is a pretty good child. Wang Qing and Nizi both said that Zhao Congbo never bullied them and while other children in the village would bully them, Zhao Cangbo would stop it if he saw it.\u201dZhao He laughed, \u201cYou still say that Cangbo is a child, but how old are you?\u201d Suddenly stopping smiling, Zhao He asked with concern, \u201cYou and Shijing should have already consummated, right?\u201dSince they were both men, Shao Yunan did not feel any embarrassment as he nodded. \u201cWell, we\u2019ve only been together in the last few days. Shijing didn\u2019t want to and said it would be better to wait for two more years since he was afraid that it would take a toll on my body. But after little Qing\u2019s accident, he couldn\u2019t hold back any longer. Anyway we should pay attention to it in the future.\u201dZhao He was more than 10 years older than Shao Yuanan, so he said with some concern, \u201cYes, you should pay attention. A male wife is not the same as a female wife. Having too much pleasure too early is prone to damage the body, which is why female wives are still preferred in the world. You can get Master Sun to give you a pair of pills to use afterwards.You\u2019re still young and Shijing\u2019s concerns are right. Yuande and I also did not officially consummate our marriage until we were eighteen. If I hadn\u2019t insisted on taking the pregnancy fruit right after the consummation of the marriage, it might have taken us two more years to have a child. Did Shijing say when he wanted you to take the pregnancy fruit?\u201dShao Yunan reply was very much the same: \u201cI\u2019ve agreed with Shijing to not have children. It\u2019s enough to have Wang Qing and Wang Nizi at home.Zhao He frowned, \u201cShijing didn\u2019t want to?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me that doesn\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t like pain.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Zhao He didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201cI don\u2019t like big bellies either.\u201d\u201cChildren are also very noisy. Since Wang Qing and Nizi are already big and know how to behave, it\u2019s good.\u201d Zhao He was defeated. \u201cJust talk it over between you two.\u201dAs they were talking, Zhao Congbo came out of the room and ran into the kitchen, coyly saying to Shao Yunan, \u201cUncle Yunan, Qing said he had some books from the dean of the county school, with the dean\u2019s commentary on them, can you lend me them to copy? I promise to not damage them.\u201dZhao He froze, but Shao Yunan just smiled, \u201cThose books are still too difficult for Qing to read, so rather than leaving them here, you can take them back and bring them back when you\u2019re done.\u201d After saying that, he immediately thought of something. \u201cLittle Cangbo, why don\u2019t you come to my house every afternoon to copy them? Or let little Qing go to your place? He is now reading some of the books, but he still doesn\u2019t know all the words. Since you already learned them, why don\u2019t you teach him while you refresh it?\u201dZhao Congbo immediately nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll come to Uncle An\u2019s house to copy. The books that Qing is reading now also have notes from the county schoolmaster, so I would like to also read them and learn from them.\u201d After saying that, he bit his lips as if he had some difficulty.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Zhao Congbo stumbled for a moment before he spoke, \u201cUncle Yunan, can you let Wang Yan also copy?\u201d He said anxiously. \u201cHe studies better than me, so he can also help Qing better.\u201dShao Yunan was helpless, \u201cChildren should not think so much. What can\u2019t be done? Every afternoon you and Wang Yan should come over to copy the books. You can also help me with teaching Qing and I will cook some delicious food for you.\u201d\u201cThank you, Uncle Yunan. I\u2019m going to tell Wang Yan!\u201d Zhao Congbo turned around and ran. Zhao He shouted after him, \u201cBy the way, go tell your father, your uncle, and your second aunt to come over for dinner tonight.\u201d\u201cAi!\u201d Zhao Congbo was already running as he yelled back, while Zhao He looked back at Shao Yunan and said gratefully, \u201cYunan, thank you so much.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t always be so polite. Come on, hurry up and make mochi. You can also prepare them for Cangbo after learning how, so he can take some with him when he studies as a snack and pad his stomach.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Zhao He was not polite, as he started to seriously learn how to make the mochi.The beaten glutinous rice was pulled into pieces, flattened in the palm, wrapped with boiled red bean paste, kneaded, slightly flattened, then covered with white sesame seeds. Zhao He ate it and immediately fell in love with it. Shao Yunan brought a plate to Wang Qing and Wang\u00a0 Nizi, while scooping out some of the pea paste for Zhao He to take back. This glutinous rice cake should be made immediately after the glutinous rice has finished steaming, otherwise, it would taste much worse.Zhao Congbo came back, followed by Wang Yan, who acted very shy. Shao Yunan greeted the two children and brought another plate of mochi into the room. The two children ate it without stopping, so Shao Yunan hurriedly urged them to eat less, since it would fill their stomachs.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After hearing Shao Yunan say that Zhao Congbo and Wang Yan were at home and that Zhao Yuande and Zhao Yuanqing were also coming for dinner in the evening, Wang Shijing said that it would be better to invite Wang Shuping and his family over as well. Zhao Congbo sat in the room with Wang Qing and Wang Nizi, eating mochi and drinking chrysanthemum tea. Wang Yan was quite relaxed. With a packet of hot bean paste mochi in his pocket, he ran all the way to his house.In the afternoon, Zhao Congbo came to visit and took Wang Yan away with just a few whispered words, so he left without saying where he was going. Now that the day was about to get dark and Wang Yan still did not return, Wang Qian asked Wang Shuping to go to Zhao Lizheng\u2019s house to look for him. Wang Shuping was about to go out, when he opened the door and collided with his son who just ran in. Wang Shuping held his son and asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dWang Yan was sweating, but said while smiling, \u201cFather, Uncle Shijing asked me to call you and mother over for dinner and said to give you this.\u201d As he spoke, he stuffed a bag of hot things into his father\u2019s arms. \u201cThis is the bean paste mochi made by uncle Yunan. He asked me to bring it back for my grandparents to eat.\u201d Wang Shuping asked in surprise, \u201cYou\u2019ve been at Uncle Shijing\u2019s house this whole afternoon?\u201d\u201cAh, Dean Cen from the county school gave Qing several books that couldn\u2019t even be bought at the county town and they all have his notes in them. Uncle Yunan agreed for me and Cangbo to go over there every afternoon to copy the books, so that we could help Qing learn to read and write. Uncle Yunan also said that he would make us some good food since uncle Yunan made mochi this afternoon, I already ate a lot over there, so these are for my grandparents to eat.\u201d\u201cLittle Yan, really?\u201d Wang Shen was surprised. Wang Yan nodded. \u201cReally, I didn\u2019t believe it at first when Zhao Congbo came for me, but after I went there Uncle Yunan treated me really well. He made me chrysanthemum tea and gave me mochi to eat. When uncle Shijing came back and saw me,\u00a0 he only asked to bring back my parents and sister over for dinner. Father, where are mother and sister? Let\u2019s hurry over.\u201dWang Qing hurriedly urged her son, \u201cShuping, hurry and call Shen and Yiting and go over.\u201d Wang Shuping looked back and handed the paper bag to his mother. \u201cI\u2019ll go and tell father. Little Yan, your mother and sister are in the backyard, you go and call them.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d As soon as he heard Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan invited his son over and his grandchildren would go there to copy books every afternoon from the next day onward, Wang Wenhe froze. However, he did not stop his son after coming back to his senses, but only urged him not to mention any clan business when he went over there and to eat properly.Wang Shuping, carrying a jar of pickled vegetables, took his wife, son, and daughter to Wang Shijing\u2019s house. Shao Yunan liked to eat the village people\u2019s pickled vegetables since he didn\u2019t have any himself, so Wang Shuping thought it was appropriate to take a jar of pickled vegetables over.When they arrived at Wang Shijing\u2019s house, Zhao Yuande and Zhao Yuanqing with their husband and wife were already there. Since Zhao He and Shao Yunan were busy in the kitchen, it was not good for Li Caijuan as a woman to help them, so she was in the yard washing vegetables.Zhao Yuande, Zhao Yuanqing, and Wang Shijing were talking in the house, so when Wang Shuping and his wife arrived, Li Caijuan finally had company. Wang Shuping was pulled into the house by Zhao Yuande, while Wang Shijing gave him a cup of chrysanthemum tea with red dates and wolfberries. Since the day was cold, drinking only chrysanthemum tea might be a bit chilly. Wang Yuting was brought to Wang Qing\u2019s side by her brother. Wang Yuting was one year older than Nizi, so both girls took a piece of mochi and sat quietly beside her brother.Since Wang Shijing behaved generously, Wang Shuping finally relaxed. Zhao Yuanqing pushed the plate with the mochi in front of Wang Shuping and said, \u201cSister-in-law made it, it\u2019s delicious. Brother Shuping, if you came just a little later, it would already be gone.\u201dWang Shuping picked one up, took a bite, and nodded \u201cDelicious.\u201dBefore Wang Shuping came, Zhao Yuande and Zhao Yuanqing were talking to Wang Shijing about the jam business. But after Wang Shuping arrived they stopped talking about it and switched topics, \u201cSince Dean Cen was willing to give Qing the book he wrote his own comments in, is it possible for Qing to go to the White Moon Academy?\u201dWang Shijing shook his head. \u201cYunan has this intention, but the White Moon Academy is not an easy place to enter. Dean Cen was willing to give us his books because he thinks highly of us, so it would be bad for us to ask for more. I think that as long as Qing has these books he can study anywhere.\u201dWang Shuping said, \u201cIf you can talk to the county magistrate, it would be better to go to White Moon Academy.\u201d Wang Shijing said, \u201cWe can\u2019t bother the county magistrate for this kind of thing. Let\u2019s first see what Qing can do. Yunan also wants to find a zither teacher for Nizi. He said that a girl should learn how to play an instrument. He also asked Nizi to learn reading and writing with Qing, saying that if a girl can\u2019t read she can\u2019t know manners. Nizi also likes to learn.\u201dWang Shuping sighed. \u201cYunan is an innovative one. You should listen to him more.\u201d Zhao Yuande and Zhao Yuanqing also echoed, \u201cYes, you should listen to him more.\u201d Zhao Yuande also teased, \u201cYou, you\u2019ve really found a treasure.\u201d Wang Shijing nodded shamelessly, \u201cWell, Yunan is a piece of treasure that I had the fortune to pick up.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re cheeky\u2026\u201d The other three became speechless, but in fact, Wang Shuping was happy that Wang Shijing was treating him so casually. The aroma came in from outside the house, making the four men unable to sit still. They waited anxiously for a while until they finally heard the Zhao He\u2019s \u2018heavenly voice.\u2019\u201cDinner is ready, prepare the table in the room.\u201d The four men immediately moved the big table, taking away the tea bowl, as the children also rushed over from the next room for dinner.Since it was cold. Shao Yunan made boiled sliced pork, steamed pumpkin, stewed chicken, shredded pork with fish, radish and pork ribs soup, sliced pork with pickled vegetables, stir-fried mushrooms, and Wang Qing and Wang Nizi\u2019s favorite shredded potatoes with vinegar. A total of seven dishes and one soup. When the dishes were brought up in pots and pans, everyone\u2019s mouth began to water.Shao Yunan divided the dishes into two portions, with the five children sitting around a small table and the adults sitting around a large table. Li Caijuan and (Wang) Shen Susu, who felt uncomfortable at the men\u2019s table, also sat at the children\u2019s table.Wang Shuping, Zhao Yuande, and Zhao Yuanqing praised Shao Yunan\u2019s delicious cooking, while Zhao He said that he wanted to learn how to cook from Shao Yunan, so Li Caijuan and Shen Susu couldn\u2019t help but follow suit. Shao Yunan however just indifferently laughed as he spoke. \u201cAs the saying goes, to capture a man\u2019s heart, you must first capture his stomach. Brother He and sisters in law should learn well, so when your own men are not honest in the future you can cut off their rations.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026 that\u2019s a good idea! Yunan is really smart!\u201d The wives laughed, while the husbands became embarrassed. The meal brought everyone closer and when everyone left after the meal, Shao Yunan gave everyone wrapped mochi to take home. Wang Shijing sent them out, but walked next to Wang Shuping. Zhao Yuande, seeing this, pulled his brother to go first, while Wang Shuping deliberately walked a few steps behind his wife and asked in a low voice, \u201cShijing, what\u2019s the matter?\u201dWang Shijing whispered back, \u201cBrother Shuping, Yunan and I both hope that you can be the clan patriarch. We also think you are the only one qualified to be the clan patriarch. It\u2019s not that Yunan and I don\u2019t care about the clan, but we think that the clan is in too much turmoil. If you want, I can talk with old father Wang.\u201dWang Shuping was very moved and after a moment of silence, he said, \u201cI understand your and Yunan\u2019s concern. I will also not hide it from you. I do have this intention, but because of my age, I am afraid that it will be difficult to convince the public. Anyway, I am not in a hurry, but if you are in need, don\u2019t be polite with me.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Regardless of the books given by Dean Cen, even the notes in the several enlightenment books given by teachers Guan and Chen gave them some new insight. The best teachers in Yongxiu County were either in the county school or in White Moon Academy. Zhao Congbo and Wang Yan who studied in ordinary schools in the county town naturally would have different gains.Shao Yunan still taught Wang Qing and Wang Nizi every morning, the same way he did before. The idioms and classical stories he told the two children attracted great interest from Zhao Congbo and Wang Yan. The arithmetic and multiplication were also a novelty to them, so the two children would ask Wang Qing what uncle Yunan taught him that day, every afternoon when they arrived. Wang Qing would repeat it, Zhao Congbo and Wang Yan would write it down and ask Wang Qing to repeat them again. Wang Qing could not write a lot of words yet and Shao Yunan wouldn\u2019t write it down either. But in this way, as Wang Qing and Wang Nizi reviewed, Zhao Congbo and Wang Yan also learned something.Zhao Congbo and Wang Yan felt that although Uncle Yunan did not know how to write many words, he seemed to be more powerful than their own teacher. Both Zhao Yuande and Wang Shuping did not expect their children to have such gains, so the two families became even more grateful to Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan.Zhao He made red dates and ginger and hawthorn jam, and after Shao Yunan tasted it, he also gave some advice. Zhao He improved it according to his advice and found that the taste was indeed much better than what he had made before. The Zhao family began to prepare for the sale of this large batch of jam before the end of year, while Zhao Congbo and Wang Yan went to Wang Shijing\u2019s house every day to study and sometimes had dinner there. They would usually also eat snacks there in the afternoon, since the children were not at their own homes most times. The adults in the two families were relieved and put more energy into the busy time, before the end of the year.On November 18, the sound of firecrackers added a lot of excitement to the peaceful Xiushui Village. Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan\u2019s new house was finally ready. The moving-in ceremony was a big event and it was necessary to choose an auspicious day. Wang Qing and Wang Nizi were very happy about their new house and ran around it. Zhao Congbo and Wang Yan, who were already familiar with the two, looked after the two of them, lest they be bullied again. There was no gunpowder at this time, but just with lit bamboo it was very lively.On the last day, Wang Shijing set up five large pots at the entrance of the new house, each with a large pot of meat and vegetable stew, such as rabbit, pheasant meat, pork, dried mushrooms and fungus. Wang Shijing did not specifically set up a table, so the villagers who wanted to come over and eat needed to bring their own bowls and chopsticks. There were also enough steamed buns. The whole village was boiling, as everyone rushed to Wang Shijing\u2019s new house with tableware and chopsticks.Wang Wenhe also came, but not to eat, but to see Wang Shijing\u2019s new house with a smile on his face. Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan\u2019s acceptance and kindness toward his grandson made him feel much better. His grandson also learned a lot of things there, especially those novelties, which gave him a different perception of Shao Yunan. After being disappointed with Wang Zhisong, Wang Wenhe seemed to see some hope again. This hope was his own grandson. Coupled with Wang Shuping\u2019s non-stop guidance, Wang Wenhe thoughts became much more open minded. He also moved from his post of patriarch and named his own son Wang Shuping as the next candidate.Wang Wenhe did not take the bowl. On seeing this, Shao Yunan stuffed a pair of bowls and chopsticks into his hand, then asked Wang Qing to scoop a large bowl of meat for him. Wang Wenhe did not refuse it and sat together with Zhao Lizheng to eat. Only Wang Dali and Wang Dafu\u2019s families did not show up, but no one went to call them. One was probably afraid of losing face, so had no courage to come to eat, while the other was probably stopped by Wang Zhisong. From what they heard, old lady Wang was already able to walk and with her habit of taking advantage of people, if she didn\u2019t show up today, it was obviously because someone stopped her.Not only did old lady Wang want to come, but Wang Chunxiu also wanted to come, but they were both blocked by Wang Zhisong at home. Wang Zhisong was really scared now. His status as a child student was preserved and the county school told him to come back to study beginning in February. Wang Zhisong also remembered when Shao Yunan said that the two families should no longer deal with each other. He was afraid that his mother and sister showing up would anger Shao Yunan, which would put him in danger again, so he stopped both his mother and sister at home.The old lady scolded Wang Shijing at home for being unfilial and cursed Shao Yunan as the star of misfortune which was dedicated to bringing down their family. She also scolded Wang Dali, cursing him for his incompetence. So many things happened at home. She and her son were both beaten, but he as the head of their family did not even dare to make a sound.Wang Chunxiu also persuaded, but she had her own idea in mind. She clearly saw that her elder brother and his husband became friendly with the county magistrate and had heard that the county magistrate had not yet married. If she could recover the relationship with her elder brother\u2019s family, then her marriage\u2026The more Wang Chunxiu thought about it, the more she thought it was feasible. If she visited her elder brother\u2019s house and persuaded her father, while stopping her mother from going there and apologized to big brother a few more times, how could they not become close again? They shared the same blood after all. If big brother forgives her, she no longer would have to fear Shao Yunan. In the future, with Wang Zhisong\u2019s merit, how could her marriage not be settled? Wang Chunxiu also hinted to Wang Zhisong that the county magistrate Jiang was still not married. Even if she could not become the official wife, being a concubine was also not losing face. Wang Chunxiu was also not ugly and if you looked closely she and Wang Shijing still have some similarities.Wang Zhisong was a little moved by what she said, but he was still afraid. This time, he was really afraid of being beaten. After everything that happened, Wang Zhisong knew that no one in his family could be trusted. But on the other hand, his eldest brother was not only rich, but also a friend of the county magistrate. He also heard that dean Cen from the county school gave Wang Qing some books. If his eldest brother could forgive him, he would no longer have to be afraid of his future career. Wang Zhisong was now anxious to find a strong backer for himself and the best backer he could think of was his own big brother.Wang Chunxiu encouraged him, saying that they will only go there to see and with so many people there, they would not be alone. If they go and just say a few good words of blessing, big brother and sister-in-law would not be able to kick them out. Wang Zhisong considered it for a long time before he finally nodded in agreement. The two of them teamed up to convince old lady Wang and promised to bring her back a big bowl of meat, which finally convinced old lady Wang not to follow them.Shao Yunan was talking to Zhao He when Tang Genshu ran over and shouted, \u201cUncle Yunan, I saw Wang Zhisong and Wang Chunxiu coming this way.\u201dShao Yunan\u2019s expression immediately turned cold. \u201cHow thick-skinned are they, to still come to my house after everything I said?\u201d This family was like a fly flying over the dish to him, disgusting to the point of no return. But someone being able to disgust him to this point was also to some extent considered a talent.Zhao He hurriedly reassured him, \u201cIf they have any face left, they wouldn\u2019t do such a thing. You and Shijing now have money and are friends with the county magistrate. It\u2019s no wonder that they want to come over and please you.\u201d Zhao He whispered something to Tang Genshu who just nodded and ran away.Shao Yunan\u2019s eyes were doubtful, but Zhao He just said, \u201cThey are Shijing\u2019s siblings. No matter how much Shijing hates them, he can\u2019t push people out with so many people around today. It will only make them come over more often. Everyone in the village knows who is the master in your family. Even if you don\u2019t show up, Shijing can handle it. Just wait.\u201d Shao Yunan was extremely disgusted, \u201cNow I kind of know what it\u2019s like to fight against the \u2018undead little strong\u2019.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what does it mean?\u201d\u201cLittle strong also known as cockroaches.\u201d\u201c\u2026 puff.\u201dZhao He smirked, thinking that Shao Yunan compared the Wang family, who had always looked at everyone from above to the filthy worm and he suddenly felt a little sympathetic to that family. Zhao He shook his head in his heart, that student child student status\u2026Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wang Chunxiu greeted everyone with a little formality and said toward Wang Shijing, who was standing with Zhao Yuande and the others delicately, \u201cBig brother and sister-in-law, today, I and Wang Zhisong come over to congratulate you on your new house.\u201dWang Shuping frowned. After they received the twenty taels of silver, they agreed to not be involved with Wang Shijing in the future, so why did they come again?Wang Shijing said \u201chmm\u201d expressionlessly and didn\u2019t reply. The charming smile on Wang Chunxiu\u2019s face couldn\u2019t hold as everyone turned their gazes toward Wang Zhisong who already turned to leave.\u00a0 Zhao Yuande, who had already been instructed by his wife, said, \u201cGo get a bowl and fill it with some meat and go back. Today is a good day for Shijing\u2019s family. You already know Yunan\u2019s temper, so don\u2019t let him see you again.\u201dZhao Yuande didn\u2019t address them as \u2018brother and sister in law,\u2019 so his meaning was already obvious. After old lady Wang received the 20 taels of silver, they had already become completely irrelevant to Wang Shijing. This matter was also \u2018intentionally\u2019 spread all over the village, so everyone was aware of it. Zhao Yuande wording it like this could be considered as a reminder, while Wang Shijing\u2019s simple \u2018hmm\u2019 was to indicate his attitude.How could Wang Zhisong not hear or see it?\u00a0 He bowed his head and wanted to leave, but was pulled by the desperate Wang Chunxiu. Wang Chunxiu smiled like she didn\u2019t understand and said, \u201cZhisong and I are the younger sister and brother of my eldest brother and sister-in-law. We used to be ignorant, but we still share the same blood with my eldest brother, so we came to make amends.\u201dWang Chunxiu looked at Wang Zhisong bowing his head and forced him to apologize with her, while many of the surrounding people were frowning and someone even laughed out loud. But Wang Chunxiu pretended not to hear, straightened up and when she still didn\u2019t hear a reply, tears appeared in her eyes. \u201cBig brother, forgive me and Zhisong, we used to be ignorant.\u201dWang Shijing opened his mouth, still expressionless. \u201cIs it ignorant to try to sell Nizi as a concubine?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Wang Chunxiu\u2019s face changed and she hurriedly said, \u201cThis was just nonsense. Nizi is my niece, how could I sell her.\u201d\u201cThen having Qing kneel all night was also ignorance?\u201d Wang Zhisong\u2019s body shrank as he didn\u2019t dare to look up. The eyes around him made him feel ashamed. Wang Chunxiu pinched her brother secretly, but still said, \u201cThat\u2019s because Zhisong was impatient and didn\u2019t have a sense of priorities. Big brother, you should ask Qing to come out and let Wang Zhisong make amends with him.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Wang Shijing\u2019s tone was light. \u201cYou guys go back. Today is a good day for my family, but if Yunan sees you he will be unhappy. In our family, Yunan is the master and you guys should be clear about it already. If Yunan acknowledges you, then I\u2019m still your big brother, until then, it\u2019s better to not meet.\u201dWithout looking at Wang Chunxiu\u2019s white face, Wang Shijing spoke to Zhao Yuande and went back. Zhao Yuande spoke out, \u201cYou guys go get a bowl of meat and go back. Previously Wang Shijing sent twenty taels of silver over, and said that you would no longer be involved with them and you accepted the money. So many things have already happened, so no words or apology can erase it. There are some things Wang Shijing can\u2019t say out loud, so don\u2019t speak about sharing the same blood. What is right and what is wrong everyone understands. You live your own life and stop thinking about Shijing\u2019s family.\u201dZhao Yuande\u2019s words were very unkind, making Wang Chunxiu cry even harder. \u201cBrother Yuande, how can you say that? No matter what, that is my big brother.\u201d Someone sneered at the side. \u201cYes. Your big brother is rich and has a backer, so he is your big brother. When your big brother had no money, why didn\u2019t you say \u2018that\u2019s my big brother\u2019? When your big brother got married, why didn\u2019t I see you at his wedding?\u201dImmediately, there was a lot of laughter around. Wang Zhisong dragged Wang Chunxiu with him and left. He couldn\u2019t stand being there any longer. But Wang Chunxiu refused to go, Wang Zhisong forcefully let go of her and walked away, wishing that he had never come in the first place. Then Wang Chunxiu looked back and saw that everyone\u2019s eyes were full of contempt for them, so even though she was much more thick-skinned, she still couldn\u2019t stay. Lifting her skirt, Wang Chunxiu ran away in tears.Many of the old people present looked at the siblings running away and just shook their heads. Zhao Lizheng, who had not spoken until now, also shook his head. How could they not see what this pair of siblings were thinking? If Shao Yunan didn\u2019t have an \u2018ability\u2019 to make money and become friends with the county magistrate, would these two come to apologize? They probably would have followed their mother\u2019s lead and bullied Wang Shijing\u2019s family.In the past, if Wang Chunxiu behaved like this, the villagers would accuse Wang Shijing of being cruel and ignoring family affection. But now that more than half of the people in the village have benefited from Shao Yunan and the people in charge of the clan and village were also on Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan\u2019s side, Wang Chunxiu\u2019s behavior was just a joke.Shao Yunan hid with Zhao He in one of the rooms. When Wang Shijing brought in two bowls of meat, Shao Yunan immediately asked, \u201cHave they left?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I made it clear.\u201d Shao Yunan gritted his teeth. \u201cThey are just cockroaches that won\u2019t die! Thick skin to this extent, even I lose!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be angry, today is a good day for our family. Eat more.\u201d Putting down the bowl, Wang Shijing patted Shao Yunan on the back and then left. Zhao He advised Shao Yunan after Wang Shijing went out, \u201cDon\u2019t be angry because of this type of people. Yuande and the others will help you and Shijing to block them. You two now have money and the county magistrate as a backer, no fool will push his luck with you. They might be of Wang Shijing\u2019s blood relatives, but as long as they grasp the ground, no matter how you scold or beat them, they will have a reason to come. If you go too far, others will only say it\u2019s your own fault.\u201d\u201cI really underestimated them.\u201d Shao Yunan regretted letting Wang Shijing go to Jiang Kangning to plead for mercy. Wang Zhisong had no chance of taking the imperial examination, but none of them spoke of it in public. So he could only wait to see Wang Zhisong being made into a big joke.Zhao He smiled, \u201cYou are the master of your family and you haven\u2019t entered the genealogy yet. As long as they think that Shijing listens to you and you will not let them into your door in the future, they won\u2019t dare to do anything. Their family is also originally like this. Back then, Shijing\u2019s grandfather and grandma were left in the old house by old lady Wang and she didn\u2019t do anything for them except to deliver two meals a day. These two people only had one thin quilt in the winter, that even my father and the patriarch of the Wang clan could not look at. At that time, the Wang clan patriarch wanted to open the ancestral hall, but Wang Shijing\u2019s grandfather and grandmother said that their son and daughter-in-law were not unfilial and they were used to living in their old house.\u201d\u201cSince they said so, it was difficult for others to meddle. Those two people were honest to the point of simplicity, just like old Uncle Wang. But their family was not separated while yours already is. The contract is clearly written, so how long will they come to you\u2026 you can shake them up. Both sides have already agreed and you have also already given them money. Wang Chunxiu may be shameless, but Wang Zhisong will never dare to mess with you again. Wang Chunxiu will turn eighteen after the New year, so she should get married soon and leave the house. Then even if she comes to you, you have something to say. A new wife looking for her big brother and his male wife would be quickly divorced by her husband.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let\u2019s see who has thicker skin!\u201dZhao He slapped Shao Yunan on the head. \u201cWhat nonsense. If you say she is trying to seduce you it might spread out into what kind of rumor. Don\u2019t let a rumor spread that you and she have had an affair. How could Wang Shijing, Wang Qing, and Wang Nizi face people in the future? Your home is so big and you are not short of money, so why don\u2019t you buy some household slaves? If they come again in the future, you will directly let the household slaves block them and if she tries to break in, she will only give herself troubles.\u201dShao Yunan rubbed his head. \u201cBrother He, I didn\u2019t notice you were so heavy-handed.\u201d\u201cI was slapping you awake! Shijing is really spoiling you.\u201d Shao Yunan said, \u201cI know you\u2019re jealous, I will tell brother Yuande that you want him to spoil you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really trying to pick a fight!\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201dShao Yunan really thought that Zhao He was a very smart person. He also gave him an idea that he thought was very good. Wang Chunxiu was Wang Shijing\u2019s sister, not his. He also hadn\u2019t entered the Wang clan tree yet. Anyway, the people outside knew that he was the head of their little family, so he as male wife really should learn more from his mother-in-law, since his sister-in-law likes to come to his house so shamelessly, why should he still be polite about it?After arguing with Zhao He, Shao Yunan hesitated for some time before he finally asked, \u201cBrother He, why did old lady Wang and her family treat Shijing so badly? Shijing is the eldest son.\u201dUnexpectedly, Zhao He also shook his head and said, \u201cNo one knows what this family is thinking. I heard from my father that Shijing was not welcomed at home since he was a child. But Shijing was really borne by old lady Wang. However, he was pretty big when she gave birth to him, so old lady Wang had a difficult labor. Maybe because of that?\u201dShao Yunan was speechless. \u201cAnd the others?\u201d Zhao He was also very puzzled. \u201cUncle Dali was never good to Shijing. Wang Shijing was beaten by old lady Wang since he was a child and although Uncle Dali never did anything. He also never stopped it. It\u2019s almost as if he never treated Shijing as his own son.\u201d Pursing his lips, Zhao He lowered his voice. \u201cJust listen and never repeat it to Shijing.\u201d Shao Yunan nodded at once and thought, was there really some inside story?Zhao He said: \u201cI heard that old lady Wang married Uncle Dali in quite a hurry. From the matchmaker\u2019s visit, to the marriage, it was less than a month. Old lady Wang\u2019s family was also considered a large family in their village, so she married over with a dowry of ten acres of land. At that time, it was said that old lady Wang saw Uncle Dali\u2019s straightforwardness and he also had no brothers to share his family\u2019s property with later. I don\u2019t know If there is any more inside information. Old lady Wang became pregnant not long after getting married and later when Shijing grew so strong and tall, not looking like uncle Dali at all, there was some rumors among the people in the village that Wang Shijing might not be uncle Dali\u2019s.\u201cBut the older generation in the village said Wang Shijing was uncle Dali\u2019s and grandpa Sun also stated that Wang Shijing\u2019s birth month was right. Some old people in the village also said that Wang Shijing looked like uncle Dali\u2019s long-dead uncle, who was also tall and very handsome. He was a famous handsome young man from the village, but unfortunately died early. So 20 years after his death, even uncle Dali might not remember him clearly. That uncle was also said to not leave any children behind after his death. His wife remarried to another village, so no one was left from that side of uncle Dali\u2019s family.\u201dShao Yunan thought that Wang Shijing not being treated well by his family was not because he did not look like his own father, right? \u201cSo does Shijing know?\u201d Zhao He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about this, but I think Uncle Dali might not like Shijing because of this. But since old lady Wang doesn\u2019t like Shijing either, it might be really because of the difficult birth?\u201d\u201cThere is something wrong with that family.\u201d Shao Yunan stopped guessing. He was afraid the real reason had something to do with old lady Wang\u2019s hasty marriage to Wang Dali. But thinking about Wang Shijing\u2019s several responses, he guessed that he might not know the real reason either. He probably didn\u2019t even know that he once had a grand uncle who looked very much like him. Shao Yunan put this matter behind him. No matter what, he will not let Wang Shijing get involved with that family again.Wang Zhisong, who ran home, went straight back to his room ignoring his own mother\u2019s calls. While Wang Chunxiu, who came back a little later, came home crying. After she stepped inside, she started to scold Wang Shijing for not thinking about brotherly love and when she saw Wang Zaizheng, she even dragged him over and beat him again. Wang Dali saliently worked on the side,\u00a0not hearing the cries in the house.When Wang Chunxiu was scolded like this, old lady Wang also started scolding Wang Chunxiu. After going there, why didn\u2019t she bring some meat back? Not to mention a bowl, she didn\u2019t even bring a single piece of meat. The old woman wanted to drag Wang Dali, asking Wang Dali to go with her to Wang Shijing. They were eating large chunks of meat over there, but their own son didn\u2019t even send their own parents a single piece of meat.Wang Zhisong came out of the room and threw the tea bowl in his hand toward his messy family members. The ear-piercing sound of a shattering cup restored the house to a temporary quiet.Wang Zhisong tensed up and looked at his parents, his sister, and nephew, and said through gritted teeth, \u201cDo you have to ruin my reputation completely before you are willing to stop? Look at how people outside look at me!\u201d He stared at Wang Chunxiu. \u201cI said no, but you still wanted to go! If you\u2019re capable, let Shao Yunan recognize you as his sister. If you\u2019re not, let mother find you someone to marry in peace!\u201d He also glared at his mother. \u201cYour eldest son has long since abandoned you! Their family is run by Shao Yunan, if you want to eat meat, ask Shao Yunan for it!\u201dWithout looking at his sister\u2019s white face or his mother\u2019s dumbfounded expression, Wang Zhisong turned around and angrily lifted the curtain to enter his room. Old lady Wang\u2019s eyes rolled as she sat on her buttocks on the floor crying and howling. \u201cWhat kind of sin have I committed\u2026\u201dOld lady Wang did not go for the meat after all, but started hating Shao Yunan even more. Wang Chunxiu, however, was still not willing to give up. As long as Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan were willing to match her with the county magistrate, with her beauty, being a concubine was absolutely secure. Wang Chunxiu knew that her mother wanted to find her a big family, but how could even a big family compare to an official\u2019s family? Wang Zhisong also said that the county magistrate of Yongxiu County would be promoted sooner or later. As long as she can become the magistrate\u2019s concubine, won\u2019t she also have the hope of becoming the main wife? Wang Shijing said that as long as Shao Yunan recognized her, he was still willing to be her elder brother. Wang Chunxiu bit her lips, did she really have to go to Shao Yunan?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After the beams were up, the next step was to cover the roof with tiles, lay the floor tiles and build the fence. The empty space near the house was specially set aside to transplant fruit trees, flowers, and vegetables at the beginning of next spring. So they will all be able to move in at the beginning of the next month at the latest.After the beams were up, Wang Shijing had to spend more time in the new house every day. Shao Yunan also came over to see it often. However, there was still work to do. The goat milk fruits were about ready and although Shao Yunan wanted to keep it for a few more months, he couldn\u2019t wait any longer. On the second day after the beams were put in the new house, Wang Shijing went to the county town and bought a carriage. The villagers were already numb with envy, so they just went to see what kind of rare thing Wang Shijing\u2019s family bought this time.Early on the morning of the third day, Shao Yunan sent Wang Qing and Wang Nizi to Wang Wenhe\u2019s house, letting Wang Shuping help them look after the two. After all, Zhao Cangbo and Wang Yan were also there. Since Zhao Lizheng\u2019s family was busy making jam, Shao Yunan did not want to give them any additional trouble. After Shao Yunan\u2019s initiative to show his goodwill, Wang Wenhe no longer felt so awkward when he saw the two of them. Also because of Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing\u2019s attitude towards Wang Yan, the Wang clan\u2019s attitude towards the patriarch\u2019s family has also changed significantly.This time, they were going to the county town to run some errands, so Shao Yunan didn\u2019t take the two children with them because the weather was already cold. They packed five small barrels of goat\u2019s milk wine and fourth-class tea leaves. Despite the fact that it was called a \u2018small barrel,\u2019 there were almost 40 liters of wine in each barrel.Wang Shijing put Shao Yunan in the cart and then drove it. After leaving the village, Shao Yunan took out some baby warmers from the space and stuck them in Wang Shijing\u2019s cotton-padded clothes. He himself also used two. Wang Shijing was reluctant to use these \u2018modern\u2019 things from the space, but Shao Yunan felt that if they didn\u2019t use them themselves, they could only be brought into his coffin after his death. There are some things they need to keep secret from Wang Qing and Nizi that could only be known by the two of them.With baby warmers together with the cotton gloves on his hand, Wang Shijing no longer felt cold at all. The carriage ran fast, but it jolted Shao Yunan badly since the carriage had no shock absorption and the road was uneven. After he gets rich, he must first build a proper road. He had to talk to Jiang Kangning about it. They should also build a road in the village.When they finally arrived at the county town, Wang Shijing took out Jiang Kangning\u2019s jade plaque and told the yamen officers guarding the city gate that they were sending things to the county magistrate and that the carriage can\u2019t be left outside the city. As soon as the other side saw that he had the county magistrate\u2019s jade token, he immediately issued him a permit for livestock entering the city.Not far from the city gate, people were crowding and bustling, making Shao Yunan curiously ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on over there?\u201d The officer replied, \u201d Yizhang Xuan restaurant is giving away porridge. Every year at this time, the congee will be given away for a month. The shopkeeper and owner of Yizhang Xuan restaurant are famous good people in Yongxiu County. This year everyone not only receives a bowl of porridge, but it also has some noodles mixed in it. \u201cShao Yunan nodded and let Wang Shijing continue to drive. Shao Yunan did not comment on the act of giving porridge. However, he still thought it was better to teach people how to fish than to give them fish. It was always better to find a job for these people so that they could be self-reliant, than to make them dependent on other people\u2019s charity.The carriage slowly drove through the crowd and not far away, Shao Yunan saw a few young drifters who looked like they were beating two beggars. The two beggars were beaten to the ground as the young drifters started to tear their clothes, while the two beggars tried to protect their chest area, and Shao Yunan saw something similar to noodles. One of the beggars kept shouting, \u201cThis noodle is ours! It\u2019s ours!\u201d The young drifters started cursing, \u201cYou beggars, if you still want to eat, you better hand it over!\u201dOn one side were the young drifters and on the other side were beggars, so no one cared. But Shao Yunan could not look away. \u201cDamn, these young drifters have the guts to rob beggars. Shijing, call the yamen officer over.\u201dWang Shijing stopped the carriage and jumped off, but did not go to call yamen. Instead, he directly strode over, lifting one stranger and directly punching him. Wang Shijing was in the army before, so he absolutely had no problem with dealing with a few shrewish drifters. In just one minute, the four or five little drifters were lying on the ground, while the two boldest ones were yelling that they would make Wang Shijing pay for their injuries.Shao Yunan shouted from the carriage, \u201cShijing, go and call someone to let the officers take them to the county magistrate\u2019s office. Let\u2019s see if robbing people on the street will not sentence them to banishment!\u201d\u201cWho are you?! Mind your own business!\u201d Several refugees rushed from the crowd. But noticing the commotion, two yamen officers in charge of maintaining order also came. Wang Shijing immediately took out the county magistrate\u2019s jade tag and gave it to the two yamen officers, saying that the drifters were trying to rob the beggars of the food they had received from Yizhang Xuan restaurant.For the people of the county government, the most unstable people in the county town were these refugees who often made trouble. The people who wanted to teach Wang Shijing a lesson immediately became afraid after seeing the county magistrate\u2019s jade token. The two brave drifters from just a moment before no longer dared to yell as the two Yamen gave an order and immediately took them all away. Together with a few drifters who wanted to help them, they were all driven out of the county town. Then it was straight talk. Everyone who dared to rob other people of food would not only be expelled from the County town, but also not allowed to enter the city again. Then no one dared to speak up again. The days were cold and if they could not enter the County town again, they would die of cold and hunger outside.The officers took away the troublemakers while two beggars trembled on the ground. One of them helped the other one and bowed toward Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing to thank them. Shao Yunan stared at the two for some time before uncertainly asking, \u201cYou two, big brother?\u201d The two men flinched as they raised their heads, while Wang Shijing uttered, \u201cWife?\u201dBut Shao Yunan was still looking at the two as he spoke. \u201cWhen I first came to the county town to ask about things, I asked two beggars for help. It seemed to be them.\u201d One of the two men spoke in a low voice, \u201cThis little brother still remembers us\u2026\u201d They actually recognized him first, but didn\u2019t dare to speak about it.Shao Yunan was surprised. \u201cWhat a coincidence!\u201d He immediately turned to Wang Shijing. \u201cShijing, didn\u2019t I tell you about them before? I didn\u2019t expect to meet them today.\u201d Wang Shijing took his hand and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Then he said to the two men, \u201cFollow me.\u201dWang Shijing no longer drove the carriage and just led the horse. Shao Yunan also got off the carriage. When the two men retreated to the side, Shao Yunan found that one of them was lame. It was also him, who asked, \u201cWe are dirty. Do you have something to ask?\u201dShao Yunan didn\u2019t mind and took a step closer to the two men as he spoke, \u201cTwo eldest brothers, I don\u2019t think you are very old. My family wants to find someone to work at home. I don\u2019t know if you are willing? The other day I had a good talk with the two brothers and I think the two brothers are not lazy people. I don\u2019t want you to sell yourselves as slaves, just come to my house to do work. I will also pay for your work and you will be free to go anytime you want.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shao Yunan spoke again. \u201cMy husband and I still have things to do, two big brothers if you are willing to wait for me in the place we met before.\u201d The crippled beggar came back to his senses first and spoke, \u201cThank you for thinking about us, but my brother and I will only cause trouble for you. But thank you for your offer.\u201dShao Yunan blinked. \u201cTrouble? You are not wanted criminals of the court, are you?\u201d The man smiled bitterly and shook his head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s just that we got into trouble back home. With someone from our hometown and that person has both power and influence, so my brother and I had to leave our hometown and come here to beg.\u201d\u201cDid you murder, set fire, or commit treachery?\u201d\u201cNeither.\u201d The beggar who had been hiding behind the crippled beggar whispered. \u201cI caused this.\u201d As he said this, he touched his face.Wang Shijing spoke. \u201cSince neither, if you are willing to take this job, come with us. My family lives in a village and no outsiders come there. If it really causes trouble for my family, it will not be too late for you guys to leave.\u201d The crippled beggar\u2019s eyes were obviously red, as the other started sniffling. Shao Yunan said, \u201cYou guys wait here.\u201dThen they saw him run into a clothing shop across the street. Soon, he came out with a big bundle and ran over to put the bundle on the wagon, as he spoke to Wang Shijing. \u201cShijing, let\u2019s go to Yizhang Xuan restaurant first and after we have settled with them, we will go to find big brother.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cThank you. Thank you! Your Grace!\u201d The crippled beggar seemed to finally react, pulling the person behind him to kneel with him, but was stopped by Wang Shijing in time. \u201cYou do the work for us, we pay for the work. It\u2019s a reasonable thing, so there is no need to do so. Wang Shijing said, \u201cYunan and I have important things to do, so I will settle you down first.\u201d\u201cThank you. Thank you.\u201d Two lines of muddy tears flowed down the faces of the two men. Shao Yunan thought for a moment and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to big brother first Shijing? It would be hard to explain the things in the carriage to shopkeeper Xu, so I will take them with me to see how fourth aunt is doing.\u201dWang Shijing thought it was a good idea. \u201cThen go first.\u201d He gave the bundle to Shao Yunan and after getting into the carriage, left first. Shao Yunan took the two people to Yizhang Xuan restaurant, while turning a blind eye to the surrounding gazes. The crippled beggar uneasily said, \u201cLittle brother, why don\u2019t you think more about it?\u201d\u201cMy name is Shao Yunan, I am sixteen this year so you can call me Yunan. My husband\u2019s name is Wang Shijing, he is ten years older than me. How old are you big brothers?\u201dThe two men glanced at each other realizing that he was really not afraid of getting in trouble because of them. The crippled beggar said, \u201cMy name is Guo Ziyu and I am twenty four this year. This is my own brother, Guo Zimu, he is two years older than you.\u201dShao Yunan wondered, \u201cHearing you speak, it sounds like you studied before. How come you became beggars after messing with the wrong person?\u201d Guo Ziyu clenched his teeth as Guo Zimu lowered his head, also not daring to speak. Shao Yunan finally said, \u201cIf it\u2019s difficult, there is no need to say more. My home is in the village and outsiders don\u2019t go there very often. I also have a big house, so if you are afraid you can just stay at home and not come out.\u201dGuo Ziyu immediately said, \u201cMy brother wants to work, so how can he hide in the house? As you can see, I have a foot problem, so why don\u2019t you think some more about it?\u201d Shao Yunan waved his hand. \u201cI have a lot of work to do at home too. You might have a foot problem, but it\u2019s not like you are paralyzed. My son wants to go to a private school next year, so he is now studying at home. I know a lot of words, but I can\u2019t write most of them, so if you can read and write please teach him.\u201dGuo Ziyu\u2019s eyes were moist. He lowered his head and blinked few times before saying, \u201cThank you, thank you.\u201d\u201cConsider yourselves fated with me. My family has a very simple size and there are not many rules. As long as you are sincere and honest, I will also treat you with sincerity.\u201d\u201cThank you for your great kindness.\u00a0 These two brothers are now at your disposal.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re both older than me, just call me Yunan. Everyone in the village calls me this.\u201dShao Yunan\u2019s straightforwardness made the two Guo brothers feel touched and moved, but inwardly they were still worried. Would they really be able to live peacefully after all this time?When they arrived at Yizhang Xuan restaurant, they saw two long rows of people lined up near it. Shao Yunan saw a signboard of \u2018meat sandwich bun\u2019 and \u2018skewers.\u2019 He grinned. The business was good and the fragrance of stewed meat and skewer soup base spread all around. Guo Ziyu and Guo Zimu covered their noses. The scent was just too appetizing. Shao Yunan, seeing it, just smiled. \u201cWhen we go to my house, I will make it for you to eat, but first I must go to find the boss of Yizhang Xuan.\u201dThe two brothers did not know why Shao Yunan brought them to Yizhang Xuan restaurant. Without disturbing the two families who were very busy managing their business, Shao Yunan took the two people through the crowd. Since there were two beggars coming, the crowd automatically dispersed. When one of the waiters of Yizhang Xuan noticed Shao Yunan, he immediately ran over. \u201cMaster Shao, are you here to find my shopkeeper or to eat?\u201d As he spoke he looked at the Guo brothers behind Shao Yunan, as well as the big bundle in his arms.Hearing the \u2018master Shao\u2019 address, Shao Yunan said, \u201cI have some personal business with shopkeeper Xu.\u00a0 If I can trouble little brother.\u201d\u201cNo trouble, no trouble. My boss said that master Shao is an honored guest of Yizhang Xuan and can come in anytime.\u201d Shao Yunan said, \u201cI won\u2019t go in. These two are with me, so I don\u2019t want to disturb the customers in your store.\u201dWhen the waiter heard this, he turned and ran quickly into the restaurant. Shao Yunan then spoke to the two people who were full of doubts. \u201cI have a little friendship with the boss of Yizhang Xuan restaurant, so you can have a bath here. In this bag are two sets of clothes you can change into after washing.\u201dThe Guo Brothers understood, but were in a bit of a dilemma after hearing him. Shao Yunan said, \u201cIf you guys need anything, just tell shopkeeper Xu, he owes me a favor.\u201d Guo Ziyu squeezed his brother\u2019s hand, \u201cEverything is up to you.\u201dShopkeeper Xu soon came out. Shao Yunan took two steps toward him and said, \u201cShopkeeper Xu, I have something to trouble you with.\u201d\u201cHow can brother Shao trouble me? Please go in first.\u201d Shao Yunan didn\u2019t move, but told shopkeeper Xu what he wanted to trouble him with and said, \u201cShijing and I have to visit the county magistrate today, so I can\u2019t go in and sit down. Please find a place for them to clean up, I have already bought clothes for them. I\u2019ll talk to Fourth Uncle and the others later. If I am not back by the time they close the stalls, tell them to help me bring these people over to the village first.\u201dThe Guo brothers had a strange feeling in their hearts, just now Shao Yunan told them that Wang Shijing went to see his \u2018big brother,\u2019 but just now he said he went to visit the county magistrate? Then they remembered that Wang Shijing took out the county magistrate\u2019s jade token when he saved them. The two brothers clasped each other\u2019s hands, could it be that they had really met a privileged person this time?As soon as Shopkeeper Xu heard that Shao Yunan was going to visit the county magistrate, he immediately said, \u201cThen I won\u2019t keep you. But you and Shijing rarely come here, so you must have a cup of water, wine, or tea with me. There are a lot of things I want to discuss with little Brother Shao.\u201d\u201cAlright, so Shijing and I will come over when we are done. Sorry to trouble you shopkeeper Xu.\u201d\u201cThere is no need to be so polite.\u201dShopkeeper Xu immediately called over the waiter and asked him to take the Guo brothers to the backyard to wash. Shao Yunan thankfully gave the bag of clothes to the waiter and secretly slipped a piece of silver to the other party.\u201cif its not too troublesome for boss Xie, please also cook a bowl of noodles for each of them, they have been hungry for a long time. There is no need for meat, just clear soup noddle will do.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dThen Shao Yunan said to Guo\u2019s brothers: \u201cYou\u00a0 can rest assured.\u201dThe Guo brothers bowed to Shao Yunan and thanked him, then helping each other, they followed the waiter. Shao Yunan let shopkeeper Xu go on with his work as he squeezed through the crowd, squeezing right to the skewers stall, which immediately caused the discontent of the people in line. The busy Uncle Wang looked up at the sound and was immediately surprised. \u201cYunan! What are you doing here?\u201dAs soon as he shouted, fourth aunt Wang and Wang Xing also looked over. Wang Zhuanghua\u2019s family who were at the meat buns stalls were also surprised as they shouted, \u201cYunan (little sister-in-law), why are you here, where is Shijing (brother)?\u201d Shao Yunan looked at their stall and pretended to be envious, \u201cBusiness is good, just look at this line.\u201dFourth aunt Wang couldn\u2019t stop smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to you and Shijing.\u201d Shao Yunan said, \u201cFourth aunt Wang, I have a favor to ask you. I have two friends here and I just asked shopkeeper Xu to help them take a bath and change their clothes. If Shijing and I don\u2019t come back before you close, can you take them to the village and let them stay at your house first? Shijing and I have an errand to run and I don\u2019t know when we will be done.\u201dAunt Wang immediately said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry and leave it to us.\u00a0 I\u2019ll let Xing find shopkeeper Xu later.\u201d Then Wang Xing took over. \u201cLittle sister-in-law, just leave it to me.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll leave these people to you. I won\u2019t delay your business either anymore, since I need to go and meet with Shijing.\u201d\u201cYunan wait!\u201d Uncle Duoqiu handed over a freshly made meat sandwich bun as Shao Yunan said, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll eat with you when I get back. It\u2019s not easy for me to do things with a full stomach. Uncle Duoqiu, Uncle Shuyin, Fourth Uncle, Fourth Aunt, I need to go now.\u201dWaving to everyone, Shao Yunan squeezed through the crowd again, bid farewell to shopkeeper Xu, and left. On the night after the two families\u2019 stalls opened, the two families came running over to say thank you straight away. In just one hour, all the food they had prepared was sold out. Business was good. Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing could also rest assured, since they didn\u2019t expect the business to be so good. The meat sandwich bun was 25 copper coins a piece, vegetarian skewers were 2 copper coins, while the meat ones were from 5 to 12 copper coins a piece. They were definitely not cheap snacks, but people still stood in a long line to buy them. It seemed that as long as something was worthwhile, there would always be people willing to spend money to buy it. Shao Yunan could even remember seeing someone buying a dozen meat sandwich buns in one breath.The two families were also not afraid of hard work. Like Shao Yunan said, they only sold for half a day, but they still had to work until dark and got up early to open. Wang Shijing also told them to not rush paying back the money he loaned them, since it wouldn\u2019t be too late to pay it back when they had spare money. Temporarily settling Guo Ziyu and Guo Zimu,\u00a0 Shao Yunan went straight to the Yamen.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was clear at a glance that it had been ordered by Jiang Kangning. He went directly to the residence of the county magistrate, which was behind the Yamen. just as he entered the main hall and before he could enter the door he heard Jiang Kangning ask, \u201cAre the people settled?\u201d\u201cBig brother.\u201d Smiling, Shao Yunan walked to Wang Shijing\u2019s side and sat down, saying, \u201cI left them to shopkeeper Xu. I also entrusted them to the village\u2019s fourth uncle. If Shijing and I stay till late, they will go back to the village with Fourth Uncle and the others first.\u201dJiang Kangning said, \u201cShijing told me. When you get back, you should still find out what kind of trouble follows them. Don\u2019t wait for trouble to come to you. Now it\u2019s not the same as in the time of the late emperor. If it\u2019s really a powerful bully, I can step in and deal with him.\u201d\u201cThen I will trouble big brother. When we go back I will ask for clarification.\u201d Jiang Kangning nodded and changed the subject. \u201cShijing said that he would wait for you to come back before opening the wine. Do it quickly.\u201dShao Yunan stood up, \u201cBrother Jing, have you taken the wine decanter?\u201d Wang Shijing answered, \u201cI took it. I put the rest in the store over there first. The boss there said that when everything is ready, he will send it all together. He also already made five tea sets, so he also brought them over.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dWang Shijing came over and washed out the wine decanter first and then took it to the stove to dry. While Jiang Kangning asked to bring \u2018wine decanter\u2019 over, curious about what it was. Wang Shijing brought a barrel of wine to the table and Shao Yunan used the wine dispenser to open the wine, while Jiang Kangning said, \u201cThis wine barrel is special. What is this wine decanter for?\u201dShao Yunan explained, \u201cAfter the fruit wine is poured out, you have to decanter it to get a better taste. The wine decanter is for that.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Jiang Kangning was enlightened. After receiving some wine, Shao Yunan took the decanter to Jiang Kangning. \u201cBrother, you smell it first.\u201dJiang Kangning smelled it and Shao Yunan said, \u201cShijing and I have never tasted this wine, so we are curious what it would taste like. Let\u2019s see how long it will take this wine to decanter.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in no hurry.\u201d Jiang Kangning actually was in a hurry. The wine was purple-red and just from looking at it, it hooked his tongue. Smelling it also made him want to take a sip right away, Jiang Kangning was already confident in the wine made by Shao Yunan before even tasting it.Shao Yunan then asked Wang Shijing to smell it too, Wang Shijing nodded, it smelled very good. Thinking about so many barrels and bottles of wine in the space, he swallowed his saliva. He gotta hurry and sort out the stuff in the space!Jiang Kangning asked in passing, \u201cRecently there are two more snacks in the county town. Are these village people related to you?\u201d Shao Yunan didn\u2019t hide it. \u201cWell, those two people have a good relationship with my family and helped Shijing a lot, so it\u2019s a reward for their good deeds.\u201dJiang Kangning said, \u201cThen you have to cook a meal for me someday. I can\u2019t always ask the government officials to buy it for me.\u201d\u201cAh, what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d As the three of them waited for the wine to decanter, Shao Yunan first prepared Longjing tea to drink. Jiang Kangning followed along and let Shao Yunan guide him on the preparation method. All five sets of tea that Wang Shijing brought were handed over to Jiang Kangning. Since he was going to the capital to talk business and pull gods into the partnership, presenting just tea was not too professional and it would be better to do it together with tea sets.\u201cBig brother, these leftover tea dregs should also not be thrown away. You can boil eggs, melon seeds, and other things to make refreshments, as long as you add a certain amount of seasoning and dry it in the sun so they can absorb the smell. Since they are all good tea dregs, it\u2019s a pity to simply throw them away.\u201d\u201cJust write me a recipe and I\u2019ll directly bring it along.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dIt takes 5 minutes to 2 hours to decanter wine. Shao Yunan smelled the wine, but the smell was still not enough, so he wrote up tea refreshments. Jiang Kangning was going to do a good job in this tea business and since the tea drugs could still be used, he should make good use of it.Shao Yunan wrote down the recipes for several kinds of refreshments and then smelled the wine again. It was already ready to drink. Wang Shijing immediately brought three porcelain cups. Shao Yunan filled the cups halfway and said, \u201cBrother, if you can meet the emperor directly, you must let the emperor soak the Longjing and pour the wine into a crystal glass.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cThe water for making this tea should also be on point. The sweeter the better.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d Jiang Kangning smelled the wine again and it was really a little different from when it was first poured, but only people who knew the wine could smell it. Shao Yunan was really mysterious. But Jiang Kangning did not ask about it and just smelled the wine again before drinking it carefully.\u201cHmm!\u201d As soon as the goat milk wine entered his mouth, it immediately stimulated his taste buds, making Jiang Kangning very surprised. Swallowing this sip, he shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s really good wine! I have never tasted such a good fruit wine before! Even the tribute wine can\u2019t compare.\u201dOn the side Wang Shijing was already pouring a second cup. Shao Yunan also tasted a mouthful but was not satisfied. \u201cIf it was replaced by grapes, it would be even more delicious. Big brother, how is it? With this wine we can do some great business, right?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d Jiang Kangning looked at Wang Shijing and said, \u201cShijing, don\u2019t take a sip! Such good wine is spoiled by your casual drinking!\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Shao Yunan laughed and hurriedly reminded him, \u201cThis wine is of low strength, but it can still go to the head.\u201d\u201cit tastes good!\u201d Wang Shijing was suddenly a little reluctant to sell all the wine in his house. This wine has to be given away and sold for money. After the two drank second cups, Shao Yunan refused to let them drink more, as he only drank one cup himself. Jiang Kangning licked his lips, took his eyes off the wine barrel with difficulty, and said to Shao Yunan, \u201cDo you happen to want to come with me to Dean Cen\u2019s place today? He had already taken the bait and still clung to the hook, refusing to let it go. Yesterday he came and asked me where to buy this tea. I think the matter of Qing going to White Moon Academy will be fine.\u201dShao Yunan was very happy. \u201cI was afraid that Dean Cen would not take the bait.\u201d\u201cBring him a barrel of wine and I promise you he will beg you to send Qing there.\u201d\u201cHaha.\u201d Shao Yunan brought a barrel of wine, a set of tea, a wine decanter, half a kilo of each of the four grades of tea, and six golden silk royal chrysanthemums. The tea leaves were very light and half a kilo of tea according to the way it is measured here was only a very large sachet. This was what Jiang Kangning told them to do. After all this tea had not yet started to sell, so its quantity was very limited. Even if you wanted to do someone a favor, a portion should still be limited. Even Jiang Kangning himself calculated tea while making it.The three went to Dean Cen\u2019s house in Jiang Kangning\u2019s carriage. Dean Cen didn\u2019t go to the county school or White Moon Academy everyday and when the days grew cold, he would spend most days at home. Jiang Kangning\u2019s carriage stopped outside the main entrance of Dean Cen\u2019s house and as soon as Jiang Kangning got out of the carriage, the servant boy from Dean Cen\u2019s family hurriedly opened the door. Jiang Kangning asked the servant boy to carry the wine, while he went directly in together with Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing. Wang Shijing carried the basket on his back, which contained the other things he had brought.Hearing that Jiang Kangning had arrived, Dean Cen hurriedly came out of his house, gnashing his teeth as if he was coming to meet his enemy. When he saw Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing following behind Jiang Kangning, Dean Cen was furious. \u201cLittle Shao, I knew it must be somehow related to you!\u201d\u201cDean.\u201d Shao Yunan smiled. Wang Shijing also followed his greeting, \u201cLord dean.\u201dJiang Kangning whispered to Dean Cen, \u201cOld Cen, let\u2019s go inside first. Not many people know about this stuff, so I don\u2019t want people to spread it yet.\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201d Dean Cen\u2019s white beard moved as he brought the three of them inside his house.\u201dWhen they entered the house, Dean Cen saw the two servant boys carrying a barrel of wine in, making his expression look a lot better. Jiang Kangning told the servant boys to be on standby and not to come in. They should also not disturb them without order. The two boys quickly retired. President Cen did not blame Jiang Kangning for the hustle and bustle, as he just looked more serious.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This wine and tea must be presented to the emperor first, so before that there shouldn\u2019t be any gossip about it.\u201d Old Cen was surprised and then nodded quickly. \u201cI have only tasted the tea you gave me with my lady. I will be careful to not leak information about it anywhere.\u201d Then Dean Cen\u2019s expression changed as he looked at Shao Yunan. \u201cDid you want to make this old man a joke on purpose?\u201d\u201cLord Dean, Yunan wouldn\u2019t dare. It\u2019s Yunan who is asking for your help and he is afraid that you will refuse, so he asked his big brother to help.\u201d When he heard him, Dean Cen was stunned again as Jiang Jiang Kangning laughed. \u201cI seem to have a destiny with the two of them, so I recognized them as brothers.\u201dDean Cen pointed at Shao Yunan, \u201cYou\u2019re a really capable kid. Say, what do you want from me?\u201d Shao Yunan said, \u201cDean, why don\u2019t you try the wine I made first? I just finished making this wine and brought it here for my brother and you. I didn\u2019t even drink it myself.\u201dDean Cen hummed twice. \u201cYou are a slick one.\u201d But he didn\u2019t voice any objections. Wang Shijing took out a clean decanter and opened the wine. When the barrel switch was turned on, Dean Cen\u2019s nose moved. He scurried to Wang Shijing\u2019s side in one step, his eyes fixed on the wine that was flowing out. Jiang Kangning immediately gave Shao Yunan a \u2018fish biting the second hook\u2019 look, but Shao Yunan just smiled, not saying anything.\u201cWhat kind of wine is this?\u201d Dean Cen\u2019s nose kept moving. Shao Yunan replied, \u201cI used the goat\u2019s milk fruit, also known as red sour fruit, to make this wine. It took a total of fifty days. If this wine had been left a little longer, it would taste even better.\u201dWhen Wang Shijing turned off the switch, Dean Cen took the wine decanter from Wang Shijing\u2019s hand (vigorously) and wanted to drink from it, but was hurriedly stopped by Shao Yunan. \u201cDean, this wine should be put aside for some time to let It taste better. It has sat in the barrel for so long, so it needs some time outside to wake up.\u201dIt was the first time that Dean Cen heard that the wine had to be awakened and Jiang Kangning also said, \u201cThis wine does taste purer after it is awakened. It also only takes the time of two incense.\u201dDean Cen sat down with the wine decanter in his hands, without any intention of returning it to Wang Shijing. He then opened his mouth and asked Shao Yunan, \u201cWhat is it? Explain.\u201dHowever Shao Yunan didn\u2019t explain as he took out the tea sets, tea leaves, and golden silk royal chrysanthemum. Then he took out a gourd of mountain spring water as he performed a tea ceremony in front of Dean Cen, before finally giving Dean Cen a cup of authentic Longjing tea and a cup of golden chrysanthemum tea. Listening to Jiang Kangning\u2019s explanation that the golden silk imperial chrysanthemum tea depended on its harvest and cost three silver for a cup in Yizhang Xuan restaurant, Dean Cen with a heartbreaking expression made Shao Yunan laugh psychologically.Dean Cen was holding a decanter, with a glass of Longjing and a cup of golden chrysanthemum tea on the table. Wang Shijing\u2019s one eye showed a smile. Shao Yunan then said, \u201cLord Dean\u2026\u201dDean Cen, \u201cCall me Elder Cen.\u201d Shao Yunan grinned. \u201cElder Cen, these are my filial piety to you. My son Wang Qing is six years old this year. Although he has not studied for long, he is a smart and hardworking child. I am still teaching him how to read and write, but I want to send him to your White Moon Academy next year to study.\u201d Once these words came out, Elder Cen couldn\u2019t help but seriously look at Shao Yunan and ask, \u201cIs it one of Shijing\u2019s children?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Shao Yunan spent so much effort and also let Jiang Kangning appear. He sent these things which could not only be described as rare, that were difficult for others to buy even with money, in order to send his stepson to study in his academy. Elder Cen couldn\u2019t help but think highly of Shao Yunan.Elder Cen stroked his beard. \u201cLetting him study in my academy is not difficult, but what are the children in the academy like, you must have already inquired. Even if I accept your things, I can\u2019t take special care of him in the academy and he will probably not fit in.\u201d\u201cI have thought of this and I will find a way to solve it. As long as you, Elder Cen is willing to give that boy a chance.\u201d Elder Cen mused, \u201cYou are a thoughtful and capable person, and it is rare to love a stepson so much. I\u2019ll tell you what, since he started to learn late, why don\u2019t you send him to my house every day so I can teach him. On the first day of February next year, you will send him to the academy.\u201d\u201cThank you, Elder Cen!\u201d Shao Yunan looked happily at Wang Shijing, who saluted Elder Cen. \u201cThank you, Elder Cen!\u201d Elder Cen said to Wang Shijing in a serious tone, \u201cWhen you marry a wife, you should marry a virtuous one. You have married a good male wife. so be sincere to him.\u201d\u201cElder Cen, don\u2019t worry. I will love Yunan for the rest of my life.\u201d In front of Elder Cen, Wang Shijing took Shao Yunan\u2019s hand as Yunan squeezed back. Elder Cen sniffed the wine in the wine decanter and asked, \u201cHow much longer?\u201d Jiang Kangning was helpless. He could already imagine what his teacher\u2019s reaction would be when he tasted this tea and wine. But Shao Yunan only said, \u201cJust a bit longer.\u201dElder Cen was so anxious that he scratched his ears and when the time came, he immediately brought a wine glass and poured wine in it. With the wine decanter in one hand, he had no intention of sharing it with anyone present. After the first taste of the wine, Dean Cen looked like his whole person had entered another world, in that world was only him and the wine decanter in his hand.\u201cElder Cen won\u2019t finish this decanter of wine in one gulp today, right?\u201d Shao Yunan muttered to Jiang Kangning in a low voice, looking scared. Jiang Kangning shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. Elder Cen is not a wine lover, but he likes good wine. It\u2019s hard to find good wine, so you delivered something straight to his heart.\u201d After saying that, Jiang Kangning heartily patted his chest. \u201cI am afraid that my teacher will not be much better.\u201dShao Yunan had to remind him. \u201cThis time the quantity is limited and we still have to make money.\u201d Jiang Kangning suddenly felt that the task of \u2018making money\u2019 was a bit difficult. He even became a little afraid that the emperor himself would not be willing to sell it after tasting it.Seeing that Dean Cen had already drunk up the wine in the decanter and wanted to fill it for the second time, Shao Yunan hurriedly spoke out. \u201cElder Cen, I can only bring you this barrel of wine this time. If you drink it all now, you will have to wait until next June. Since goat milk fruits only bear fruits starting in April.\u201dDean Cen\u2019s action paused. \u201cThe wine is good, but you can\u2019t get greedy, otherwise it will quickly go to your head. Drinking two cups a day is enough.\u201d\u201cNot until after June next year?\u201d Dean Cen felt like he was struck with a lightning bolt. Then he spoke. \u201cYou must still have some there! I don\u2019t want you to give it to me for free, how much silver per liter? I will buy it. That tea too. I will not take advantage of you, I will pay as much as others.\u201dShao Yunan was unable to laugh or cry, but Jiang Kangning said in time, \u201cElder Cen, I will take this wine and tea to the emperor, so this wine and tea cannot be sold for the time being. It also depends on the emperor\u2019s intention. The amount Yunan made is not much, so I also only have one small barrel and have to save it up.\u201dShao Yunan said, \u201cElder Cen, I just made it this year. Don\u2019t tell me you want to buy it. I won\u2019t take your money. Next year I will add more, but I can\u2019t guarantee how much this goat milk wine will be next year. But I will give you at least two large barrels of a hundred liters each. The amount of tea will also be two kilos per class and at least fifty golden chrysanthemums.\u201d\u201cNo, I can\u2019t take advantage of you. If these things were sold, not to say that it would be worth a lot of money, it would still be difficult to buy\u2026 I\u2019ll take the ones you sent me this time, and I\u2019ll buy the future ones myself.\u201dShao Yunan said helplessly, \u201cElder Cen, don\u2019t think I\u2019m losing out, sometimes losing out is taking advantage. If you insist, I have two nephews who are close to my son. They are ten years old this year and have been attending private school for two years. All three of them study together every day and read together. My two nephews are also good children who are good at learning and improving rapidly. So why don\u2019t you take them together? The wine and tea I give you every year will be used as payment for the three children, how about that?\u201dJiang Kangning immediately said, \u201cElder Cen, I think this is a good idea. If you insist on paying money for it, it will be difficult for Yunan and Shijing.\u201d Elder Cen swayed, for him to accept three children into the academy was something too easy to do.\u201cI have one more thing to trouble Elder Cen with. My daughter is four years old and I want to find a female teacher to teach her how to play the zither or other musical instruments. I don\u2019t want her to be bored at home all day, so she can learn to play the zither and nurture her emotions.\u201dWhen Elder Cen heard that, his spirit was shaken. \u201cThat\u2019s good. There is no need to look for one, my wife can play the zither. There are no children at our house, so your daughter can come and keep my wife company. She doesn\u2019t have to come every day to learn the zither, just send her here every two days.\u201dShao Yunan was delighted. \u201cThank you, Elder Cen.\u201dElder Cen, \u201cWhat\u2019s your daughter\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cHer name is Wang Nizi.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not a good name.\u201d Elder Cen thought deeply and said, \u201cI\u2019ll give her a nice name the day you send her over. Daughters need a good name to find a good family in the future.\u201d\u201cThen I will trouble Elder Cen.\u201dElder Cen immediately changed his tone. \u201cThat\u2019s the deal. I\u2019m waiting for your tea and wine next year. You don\u2019t have to give me so many golden silk chrysanthemums, twenty is enough. The things you give are more than enough for the three children\u2019s education.\u201dShao Yunan said with a smile, \u201cI am still calculating. At least fifty-fifty. Money can always be earned so you shouldn\u2019t become a slave to money.\u201d\u201cSlave to money\u2026\u201d Elder Cen laughed openly. \u201cWell since you have ambition and heart, so I will take advantage of you. If you have a need for this old man to intervene in the future, don\u2019t beat around the bush and come directly to say it. The three boys from your family can be sent over together tomorrow.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fierce \u201cHusband\u201dCH 52.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 52.1Elder Cen was happy to keep the three of them for lunch at the house, but stingily did not drink any goat\u2019s milk wine. Old Cen\u2019s wife was a woman, so she didn\u2019t attend. The old man complimented Shao Yunan during the meal. It could be seen that he appreciated Shao Yunan very much and also said that Wang Shijing had married the right person. Wang Shijing felt honored. His wife was naturally unique and no one could compare to him.The three of them returned to the Yamen after leaving Dean Cen\u2019s house. Jiang Kangning gave the two of them some background information on Dean Cen. \u201cElder Cen and teacher studied under the same master and could be considered brothers. Before elder Cen resigned, he was a scholar at the Imperial College and a fourth rank official. He is a person who is very dedicated to learning. In the later years of the late emperor, he was very petty and after listening to some slander, Elder Cen\u2019s family nearly suffered.It was thanks to my teacher\u2019s help that Elder Cen was able to keep his life, but he was discouraged, so he resigned and returned to his hometown. Later, the current emperor invited Elder Cen to return to the capital, but Elder Cen refused to do so because he was too old and his wife was not well. Many of Elder Cen\u2019s students and friends were unjustly killed in the hands of traitors, so elder Cen is no longer willing to have an official position.Although elder Cen resigned and returned to his hometown, there are still many of his friends and students who are officials in the imperial court. But since Elder Cen doesn\u2019t want to publicize it, not many people in Yongxiu County know about it.\u201dShao Yunan said, \u201cThank you for the advice. I just hope that in the future, tragedies like Elder Cen\u2019s will not be repeated and the country will truly be at peace.\u201d\u201cWe all hope so.\u201d\u201cSo, doesn\u2019t Elder Cen have any children?\u201d\u201cHe has a son and a daughter, but both of them live in the capital. Both son and son-in-law work in the Imperial College. They are both scholars.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d After chatting with Jiang Kangning for some time, Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing said goodbye to him and prepared to go home. Thinking that shopkeeper Xu wanted to speak about something with him, Shao Yunan asked Wang Shijing to go directly to Yizhang Xuan. When they arrived at the door of the restaurant, they saw that both stalls were already closed, so fourth aunt should have already gone back.The carriage stopped outside Yizhang Xuan restaurant and shopkeeper Xu came out. Seeing Wang Shijing and Shao Yunan, shopkeeper Xu said, \u201cBrother Shao, your two friends have gone back to the village with your fourth aunt.\u201d\u201cGood, thanks a lot, Boss Xu.\u201d\u201cLittle brother Shao and I don\u2019t need to be polite, come in and have a cup of hot tea.\u201d Handing the carriage over to the waiter, Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing entered Yizhang Xuan and were guided to the elegant room on the second floor by the shopkeeper Xu. It was not yet time to eat so there weren\u2019t many customers in the restaurant. Hot tea was served. It was a very ordinary tea as the shopkeeper said apologetically, \u201cI sent all of the chrysanthemum tea I bought from little brother Shao to the capital to the owner, so I\u2019m sorry about this tea.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I happened to be thirsty too.\u201d Shao Yunan picked up the tea cup and drank two sips before putting it down and asking, \u201cI don\u2019t know what Shopkeeper Xu wants to discuss with me?\u201d\u00a0The shopkeeper first seemed to face some difficulty, but then he said, \u201cLittle brother Shao, you gave the recipe for the meat bun and the skewers to your fourth aunt\u2019s family and Uncle Duoqiu\u2019s family, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Shao Yunan didn\u2019t deny it, but still had some concerns in his heart. It must have something to do with this, so before shopkeeper Xu spoke, Shao Yunan said, \u201cFourth Aunt and Uncle Duoqiu were very kind to my family. Since the busy farming season ended, I gave them these two recipes, so they can earn some small money.\u201dShopkeeper Xu immediately said, \u201cLittle brother Shao is modest. The people who come to eat it every day are endless. Even the customers in my store want to try it at least once.\u201d\u201cThen what does Shopkeeper Xu mean?\u201d Shopkeeper Xu said, \u201cYizhang Xuan wants to cooperate with your fourth aunt and Uncle Duoqiu\u2019s family. I originally asked them to come to the store to sell since days are growing colder, but they didn\u2019t want to. I thought that I might rent a store. Fourth aunt and Uncle Duoqiu can sell it in the store, while Yizhang Xuan restaurant will provide the ingredients. This way they won\u2019t have to get up every day to prepare the ingredients. The profit earned can be split 3:7. Their cut will be 7, while Yizhang Xuan gets 3.\u201dShao Yunan pretended to think deeply about it. \u201c I can\u2019t decide this. Did you tell them?\u201d Shopkeeper Xu said, \u201cI mentioned it, but they refused. That\u2019s why I wanted to discuss it with you.\u201dShao Yunan said, \u201cAfter I sold them these two recipes, I made it clear that I would not interfere with how they do business. Fourth Uncle and Uncle Duoqiu can\u2019t just do business. They still have fields to work on. At first I also suggested that they open a store, but opening a store just to close it later on is not good. Farming season would be equivalent to losing money. But opening a simple stall does not pose these problems. I can go back to discuss it with them again, but it all depends on their intentions. I think I\u2019ve pulled some business for Yizhang Xuan these days.\u201dShopkeeper Xu did not hide it and just nodded. \u201cYes\u2026 we now have more people coming to eat at Yizhang Xuan than in the past. I will not hide it from you, but from November to March is the coldest time to do business, but the boiled pork recipe you give me sells especially well, but when there is no cabbage, it is impossible to make.\u201dShao Yunan was helpless. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do about it. I also had to ask some village aunt to help me with canning pickles and bacon. I can\u2019t do it myself.\u201d He had no intention of mentioning the warm room (greenhouse) in his new house.Boss Xu said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll be grateful to Little Brother Shao for helping to ask.\u201d Shao Yunan didn\u2019t mention giving him a new recipe for the dish, so it was not good for shopkeeper Xu to ask, although he thought of it. \u201cOkay.\u201dBoss Xu enthusiastically left Shao Yunan and Wang Shijing to eat dinner, but they refused since the children were still waiting for them. After they left the Yizhang Xuan, they bought cloth and a lot of cotton. They also directly bought Wang Qing and Nizi three sets of better clothes. After buying some more glutinous rice, they headed home.Back in the village, Shao Yunan asked Wang Shijing to pick up the children, while he went to fourth aunt and Uncle Duoqiu\u2019s house. Wang Shijing was not very happy as he spoke. \u201cWhy does Yizhang Xuan have to be involved in every business? If he makes such a request, how can they refuse?\u201dShao Yunan said, \u201cBusinessmen are driven by profit, it\u2019s normal. This is why I let fourth aunt and their stall stay ten feet in front of Yizhang Xuan restaurant. In any other place they would have already been targeted. You can see how good their business is. Shopkeeper Xu enduring until today to speak to me makes me really admire his patience. I am not a real businessman.\u201d\u201cJust enough to eat and enough to live.\u201d Wang Shijing doesn\u2019t like this very much, but his wife could figure it out. He then asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d Shao Yunan said, \u201cThat\u2019s fourth Aunt and Uncle Duoqiu\u2019s business. It depends on what they want.\u201d Wang Shijing nodded and stopped asking.The two of them parted ways at the halfway point and Shao Yunan instructed Wang Shijing not to say anything about studying at the White Moon Academy yet or else they might not be able to sleep tonight. Shao Yunan also admitted that it left a bad taste in his mouth.Shao Yunan went to Uncle Duoqiu and uncle Yinzi\u2019s house first, where they had just finished eating dinner with Wang Zhuanghua and uncle Duoqiu\u2019s parents. The family was very enthusiastic when they saw Shao Yunan. They sold the meat sandwich buns for 35 copper coins and could sell more than 200 daily, since the meat and buns they could bring were limited. These days, they earned no less than the jam and chrysanthemum tea. Hearing that Shao Yunan hadn\u2019t eaten yet, uncle Yinzi was about to go get him food, but was stopped by Shao Yunan.Shao Yunan said that there were still things to be done at home, so he only came over to ask about the matter proposed by shopkeeper Xu. To tell the truth, shopkeeper Xu also mentioned it to them, but uncle Duoqiu and uncle Yinzi, as well as fourth aunt Wang\u2019s family were not too willing. If they cooperate, with Yizhang Xuan restaurant in the background there is no guarantee that they will not be eaten by Yizhang Xuan. Their recipe also wouldn\u2019t be safe, so they were afraid.Shao Yunan then gave them an idea. Since both families needed a lot of pork, especially Uncle Duoqiu\u2019s family, they planned to raise their own pigs. Why don\u2019t both families buy pigs from the butcher\u2019s house in other villages? Shao Yunan proposed that the two families leave the parts of the pork they need and then use their own ingredients to marinate all the leftover pork and together with spicy marinade and sell it Yizhang Xuan restaurant, as a return to the favor for Yizhang Xuan for giving them a shelter.What would be left from the pig were, ribs, pig head, pig feet, pig ears, pig tail and many others parts. The two families could leave some for their own use, while the rest could be sold to a county restaurant after Yizhang Xuan restaurant received their part. According to Shao Yunan\u2019s advice, they only needed to cook the base and stew the meat when they got more ingredients. The finished product could also be sold for more money. While Yizhang Xuan restaurant who received the meat would not want to mention the cooperation again.Uncle Duoqiu and uncle Yinzi praised Shao Yunan for being smart and when they agreed Shao Yunan went to find Fourth Uncle and Fourth Aunt. Fourth uncle and fourth aunt also just finished dinner and their whole house was filled with the aroma of the skewer incense base. As soon as Shao Yunan entered the house, he saw two strange men, one of whom still had a dirty face, and then he instantly remembered who they were.\u201cYunan, you\u2019re back, have you eaten yet?\u201d\u201cNot yet, I\u2019ll go back to eat later, Shijing has already gone back. These two big brothers are Guo Ziyu and Guo Zimu?\u201d\u201c\u2026 little brother Shao.\u201dThis Guo Ziyu looked quite handsome. Not Wang Shijing\u2019s kind of ruggedly handsome, but with this change of clothes and gis tied up hair, he gave off an air of elegance. Coupled with his appearance, he would absolutely be liked by women. Guo Zimu\u2019s face was still dirty, but Shao Yunan guessed that his face would definitely not be just handsome.The two men stood up and bowed. The fourth aunt said helplessly, \u201cI asked little brother Zimu to wash his face, but he refused.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
