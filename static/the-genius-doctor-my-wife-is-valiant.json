It was clearly stated in the contract that if you were caught having an affair, we would withdraw everything we\u2019d given your family, along with all the profit that your family made during this period of time.\u201d\u2026\u201cYoung Mistress, the Zhan family is very well known. Although the third young master has encountered some misfortune, the family\u2019s name and reputation must be maintained. The Zhan family will never accept a granddaughter-in-law who\u2019s having an affair, especially not the wife of the third young master, whom the master loves very much!\u201d\u2026\u201cI\u2019m sure that Young Mistress must have weighed the pros and cons of the situation before agreeing to this marriage, which is why you should have been aware of the relative importance of your actions. Rather than simply thinking about the gains, you should have also considered whether or not you and your family would be able to deal with the consequences of the loss due to your actions.\u201dIn a luxurious VIP ward, a professionally dressed butler was desperately trying to talk some sense into a woman who was lying down on a bed. His facial expression reflected what he was thinking: this young woman was not worthy of being taught.As for the woman, she was casually lying on her side at the edge of the bed, with a phone in hand. Her long, curly, chestnut-colored hair was like seaweed, becoming entangled around her fair, swan-like neck and slightly covering her exquisite face.She was like a cat on a sofa: casual and lazy.The butler wasn\u2019t sure if the young mistress was even listening to what he was saying.He did note, however, her rapidly moving long, slim fingers across the screen. Even if she were simply playing some brain-damaging mobile game, you would feel as if she was playing an incredible piece of music; the movement of her fingertips gave off a breathtaking sense of art.On the phone, which he thought was just playing a brain-damaging mobile game, codes filled up a blue screen which was followed by an unfamiliar interface that popped up.Soon after, without any additional effort, a video titled \u2018Jing Qian and her paramour\u2019 appeared.As soon as it popped up, it was forcibly deleted by the codes.Following that, all the interfaces on the screen, including \u2018saved documents,\u2019 \u2018settings,\u2019 \u2018recently deleted,\u2019 and even the drive, along with the chat box, disappeared; none of them could survive being forcibly deleted by the rampant codes.Everything that was related to the video, including texts, voice messages, and videos, had been cleared away.With that done, the woman threw the phone onto the bed and looked at the butler. Her eyes were beautiful and clear, but at the same time, filled with a sense of laziness and a deceptive charm.The corner of the lady\u2019s lips rose up slightly, and as the soft, red lips parted, a voice as clear and light as a stream came out, along with a drawl that made her sound lazy and seductive.\u201cHearing all your maunder, is this because Jiang Yuxi has been prattling about me having a lover? Butler Xu, from the moment I woke up until now, you\u2019ve been talking about nothing else for the past 15 minutes. Do you have any evidence to back up her claim?\u201dButler Xu\u2019s face darkened. Had he been casting pearls before swine?\u201cYoung Mistress, as Miss Jiang was leaving, she informed me that she has a video! She will be showing it to the master later!\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

Our third young master is his favorite and no one is allowed to harm him! If he\u2019s convinced that you\u2019re in the wrong, Master Zhan will never forgive you. So I\u2019m advising you, just tell me the truth. Do you have a lover? If it\u2019s true, let me know and I can help.\u201dWhen she saw Butler Xu speaking nonsense with such a serious look on his face, the woman couldn\u2019t help but laugh.The moment when she laughed, she was shocked herself.Her depression\u2026Had she recovered from it when they swapped?!After realizing what was happening, the woman who hadn\u2019t cared much about her rebirth, having been ready to throw everything away and leave, decided then and there to value her new identity.Since she was no longer depressed and there were no suicidal thoughts present, life was actually pretty great.Her new identity was that of a woman called Jing Qian, who was married to Zhan Lichuan, the paralyzed third young master of the Zhan Family. Since her \u2018Ba-Zi\u2019* matched his, they had given her family 100 million yuan and brought her over as his wife. They had also promised her that as long as she was loyal to Zhan Lichuan, they would give her an additional 100 million yuan each year.However, if she was caught cheating or betrayed their young master in any way, the Zhan family would take back all the money they had given her, along with any profit that she made during this time as a result of that money.She had only been married for three weeks and already she\u2019d ended up getting caught by her rival-in-love, who had a video of her talking on the phone with her so-called \u2018lover.\u2019 Although that lover was actually her ex-boyfriend, the rival planned to expose her in front of the old man.Frightened, she had accidentally fallen down the stairs while trying to snatch the phone away from her rival and died as a result.\u201cYoung Mistress, why are you laughing?\u201dShe had already betrayed the third young master, but now she had the audacity to laugh?! This woman knew no shame! Butler Xu became infuriated, his face turning completely black.\u201cYou said it yourself. If he found out that I betrayed the third young master, he would chase me out of the family. In that case, why would you ever offer to help me? Since you work for grandfather, that means you\u2019d be betraying your own master. Well, it\u2019s either that, or you\u2019re trying to fool me.\u201cButler Xu, I\u2019m not gullible. I hope you know that.\u201dA pair of seemingly amorous, peach-blossom eyes smiled up at him, but the smile was actually accompanied by a cold, sharp look.When he made eye contact with such intriguing eyes, Butler Xu secretly became shocked. Who would have thought a young woman like her, who came from a small family, would have such aura and charisma?However, he quickly explained, \u201cThe Feng Shui Master mentioned that your \u2018Ba-Zi\u2019 matches that of our third young master\u2019s perfectly. As long as you marry him and stay by his side, the third young master\u2019s life will improve. I\u2019m simply hoping that the Zhan family becomes better under his leadership.\u201cThat is why I\u2019d like to believe that all of this is simply because you married into the Zhan family in such a hurry and didn\u2019t have enough time to properly settle matters from your past. As long as you let me know who it is, I will be able to get rid of this person before you\u2019re even discharged from the hospital.\u201dAfter hearing what he said, Jing Qian raised her eyebrows, a look of excitement appearing on her previously indolent face.Getting up from the bed, she put on her slippers and walked past the butler.\u201cLooks like this Feng Shui Master is quite an expert. Why don\u2019t you bring this master here in the future so that I can meet him? I want to know if I\u2019ll make a fortune, surprise the world, and end up the richest person on earth.\u201dHuh?**TL note: the term \u2018Ba-Zi\u2019 that was mentioned in the text is also known as the four pillars of destiny. A Chinese astrological concept, it\u2019s the idea that a person\u2019s destiny or fate can be divined by the two sexagenary cycle characters assigned to their birth year, month, day, and hour \u2014sourced from Wikipedia.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Did she assume that he was a cheap streetside vendor that one could meet whenever they wanted?The richest person on earth?!Even the Zhan family weren\u2019t the richest people on earth! Did she hurt her brain when she fell?!!When he noticed that she had already left the room, he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cYoung Mistress, where are you going?\u201d\u201cHome.\u201dButler Xu felt dejected.Not that he was being dramatic about it. This woman had clearly seen her bag and phone, which she left on the bed, but refused to reach for them herself. Instead, she just walked out of the room, with her hips swinging joyfully.In any case, he was the main housekeeper of the Zhan family, not her personal assistant. Did she not feel like this was somewhat inappropriate?\u201cYour CT scan report is not out yet. You can\u2019t leave!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t injure any major blood vessels. It was just a mild concussion. A good rest is all that\u2019s needed. As for the cut, just get the family doctor to change the dressing every two days and I\u2019ll be fine.\u201dAs he watched the cold, slender figure that was enchantingly rebellious walk away as she twisted her waist, which was as thin as a snake, she was so captivating that a lotus could bloom with every step she took. Butler Xu couldn\u2019t help but want to put a crown on her head.This woman, how could she behave like this?\u201cWe\u2019ll still have to wait for the report. Whatever you said doesn\u2019t count!\u201dAt this exact moment, at the end of the corridor, a doctor walked towards them. When he saw Jing Qian, he greeted her politely, \u201cYoung Mistress.\u201dJing Qian took a moment to react. After making sure that he was addressing her, she nodded. Her actions were filled with innate nobleness and coldness.Then, he turned around and saw Butler Xu\u2014who was dressed in an elegant, classic English suit, with his hair neatly combed back\u2014chasing after Jing Qian. He was carrying a bag on his shoulder that had a huge logo on it, as though he was worried that no one would notice that it was a limited edition Chanel. There was also a shiny phone in his hand that was bedazzled with diamonds. This scene definitely looked like a female tyrant who was bringing around her lap dog for a spin at her company.\u201cWhat are the results?\u201d Butler Xu asked.The doctor finally came back to his senses from the painful scene and answered, \u201cThe cut on Young Mistress\u2019s head is about five centimeters long and 0.35 centimeters wide. Although there was a lot of bleeding, none of the major vessels were injured. It was just a minor concussion. Allow her to rest at home and she\u2019ll be fine. As for the cut, please get a family physician to do the dressing every three days. Try to avoid getting the wound wet while washing your hair.\u201dButler Xu: !!!She\u2019d been right.\u201cCan she be discharged now?\u201d\u201cYes, sir. Young Mistress\u2019s condition isn\u2019t that severe. She can leave anytime now.\u201dButler Xu raised his head, wanting to thank the doctor. However, he then found Jing Qian, who was already at the end of the corridor, followed by the bodyguards whom he had brought. This scene\u2026This was what it looked like when Master left for his inspection trip, did it not?Butler Xu picked up the pace, went into the car, and passed the things over to Jing Qian. \u201cYoung mistress, your bag and phone.\u201dWhen she saw that the things were not to her taste, Jing Qian had a disgusted look and said, \u201cJust hold on to them for now. Pass them back to me later.\u201d\u201c\u2026Sure.\u201d\u201cYoung Mistress, what you said earlier was also what the doctor told me. Do you happen to know a thing or two about medicine?\u201d\u201cNope,\u201d Jing Qian denied quickly.\u201cThen, how did you know about your condition?\u201d\u201cI searched it up online.\u201d\u201cYou searched for your own result?\u201d Butler Xu obviously didn\u2019t believe her.\u201cYeap, only for $9.90. 48 hours online consultation from a tertiary hospital.\u201d\u201cI see!\u201dButler Xu nodded his head as he took in the news, although he couldn\u2019t help but feel as if he was being duped\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, as she passed by them, these people still politely addressed her as \u2018Young Mistress\u2019.When she saw the servants who still greeted her even when they had an evil look in their eyes, Jing Qian didn\u2019t even bother nodding her head. She walked into the dining room with her head held high.The person sitting in the dining hall was her \u2018boss\u2019. The head of the Zhan family, Chairman of the Op. Corporation, Mr. Zhan Renhao.His son, along with his daughter-in-law, had passed, leaving three children behind, Zhan Renhao\u2019s grandchildren\u2014Zhan Yuheng, the eldest; Zhan Shuyu, the Second miss of the Zhan family; and finally, the third young master, Zhan Lichuan.At this moment, the first young master, Zhan Yuheng, was sitting on the left, while Miss Jiang Yuxi, who had the video, was sitting to the right of the old man. As for the second miss, Zhan Shuyu, she wasn\u2019t home yet.Jing Qian didn\u2019t want to be close to any one of them, so she picked a seat that was opposite the old man.\u201cGrandfather.\u201dAfter sitting down, Jing Qian used the most polite way that she could think of and greeted her \u2018boss\u2019.Jiang Yuxi noticed that Jing Qian didn\u2019t look scared. She had even acted out and picked a seat that was directly opposite of grandfather, looking as if she was going to fight the three of them. Jiang Yuxi couldn\u2019t help but scoff.Jing Qian cleaned her hands with a towel as she said, \u201cWhat are you trying to say with that laugh of yours, Miss Jiang? Do you not wash your hands before you eat?\u201dJiang Yuxi accidentally choked when she heard Jing Qian\u2019s question. As she watched Jing Qian elegantly wiped her enviable hands that were as beautiful as flowers, a sense of destruction rose in her heart. Then, she replied with a sarcastic smile on her face.\u201cJing Qian, don\u2019t you know why I\u2019m laughing at you? Did you already forget what happened this afternoon? Or perhaps you\u2019re going to take the advantage of your head injury and would be telling me that you have actually lost your memories. Are you sure you don\u2019t remember everything that happened before?\u201dAs soon as Jiang Yuxi opened her big mouth, she sealed up all the excuses Jing Qian could have used.After what had happened, she didn\u2019t believe this b*tch who was helping others while living off of them could still stay in the Zhan family.Jing Qian slightly smiled and said, \u201cOh, I would have to disappoint you, Miss Jiang. I just got a minor concussion. Didn\u2019t hurt any of the major vessels, and definitely didn\u2019t lose my memory.\u201dJiang Yuxi sneered. \u201cDisappoint me? Why would I be disappointed? Disappointed with you for not remembering what happened in the afternoon? Since you didn\u2019t lose your memory and grandfather is here, why don\u2019t you give us all an explanation as to what happened in the afternoon?\u201dJing Qian took a sip of the soup then looked at Master Zhan calmly and casually. \u201cGrandfather, there\u2019s something that I don\u2019t really understand.\u201dThe old man, who was enjoying his meal and didn\u2019t seem to be bothered about the argument, wiped his mouth with a napkin and looked at Jing Qian. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWhen you personally came to me and asked me to marry the third young master, you were sincere about it, right? Or perhaps, Miss Jiang was the one that you would prefer to be his wife?\u201d\u201cYou and Lichuan are now legally married. I\u2019m happy for both of you. As for Yuxi, I remember telling you about who she is.\u201d\u201cOh! But I hit my head today. Maybe it was the concussion, but I don\u2019t remember who she is anymore.\u201dThis woman just said that she didn\u2019t have amnesia and now she was saying that she didn\u2019t remember anything because of the concussion!

When he died, he told me to take care of her in his place, as she was still a minor at the time. Therefore, I planned to take care of her until she turned 23 and graduated from college. Then, she will leave the Zhan family and live her own life, one that has nothing to do with Lichuan.\u201dThe cynical smile that Jiang Yuxi had on her face slowly disappeared when she heard what Master Zhan said, her face slowly becoming pale.\u201cGrandfather?!\u201dHer voice shook as she called for Master Zhan, unable to believe that these words personally came out of his mouth.She had always thought that even if the old man had been muddled enough to listen to the quack and make this horrible woman Brother Chuan\u2019s wife, he still really liked her deep inside! She had even thought that he took her in as his own granddaughter!Jing Qian took a piece of Gongpao prawn and placed it in her mouth. She slowly enjoyed the delicious home-cooked food before commenting, \u201cGrandfather, look. Even after hearing you say it yourself, she still has an incredulous look on her face. If she doesn\u2019t believe what her foster parent is saying, do you really think that she will still remember her place and do her part when you\u2019re not around?\u201d\u201cJing Qian, shut up!\u201dJiang Yuxi felt her entire body turn cold, even as it trembled with rage. She hadn\u2019t known that the old man had no plans for her to marry Zhan Lichuan, and even planned to kick her out of the Zhan family.Her main concern now was that she was 22 this year. That meant that there were only six months left before she turned 23!Jing Qian shrugged her shoulder indifferently and continued to cause trouble without feeling any pressure, all the while facing a serious Master Zhan who looked so terrifying that no one would dare mess with him.\u201cGrandfather, usually whenever you\u2019re not around, she\u2019s always treating me this way. Everyone else addresses me as Young Mistress, but she directly calls me by my name. Sometimes, she would even call me a b*tch. She doesn\u2019t approve of my identity.\u201d\u201cWhen have I ever called you a b*tch?!\u201dJiang Yuxi was shocked and speechless. Her face had the appearance of someone looking at a schizophrenic person.Although that was indeed how she had been secretly referring to Jing Qian, she only said it to herself. Yuxi wasn\u2019t stupid. Before getting any solid evidence and making sure that she could get rid of Jing Qian permanently, she wouldn\u2019t do something so obvious.The way that Jian Qian said all this, it was obvious that she was framing her!However, Jing Qian didn\u2019t feel any burden from all the bullsh*t she was spewing and continued. \u201cIn the beginning, I didn\u2019t pay much mind to it. Even if she doesn\u2019t approve of me, it doesn\u2019t matter because I shouldn\u2019t need to prove to her.\u201cBe that as it may, the third young master is a married man who has a wife living with him. This woman, who has only been temporarily fostered in the Zhan family, has been going into my husband\u2019s room every day. It\u2019s gotten to the point that even I suspect that she\u2019s the owner of this household, while I\u2019m just a beautiful flowerpot that\u2019s simply considered decoration in the Zhan family.\u201dWhile belittling Jiang Yuxi, Jing Qian didn\u2019t forget to compliment herself. She was indeed quite happy with the new body that she had just received.\u201cJing Qian, stop lying!\u201d Jiang Yuxi got so triggered by what Jing Qian said that her chest dramatically moved up and down.\u201cMe, lying? Who was the one who entered the third young master\u2019s room with a thin nightdress on that showed the small part of your cleavage while trying to feed him bird\u2019s nest this morning?\u201dJing Qian looked at a certain part of Jiang Yuxi\u2019s body with disdain and continued with a sneer, \u201cI\u2019m not saying this to hurt you, but this flat body of yours makes it really hard for others to identify your gender even if they wore a pair of \u2018contacts\u2019 when they don\u2019t need. If someone ever bumped into you and accidentally touched it, they would think that they\u2019ve touched a man\u2019s chest instead. This was why I never thought of saying anything to you because I really sympathize with someone as pitiful and disabled as you.\u201dMaster Zhan was shocked.The first Young Master, Zhan Yuheng, who had been quiet all along, reacted in the same manner.Jiang Yuxi\u2019s face was now bright red, her entire body shaking.When Jing Qian saw that Jiang Yuxi was speechless from all that humiliation, she slowly sipped on the mushroom soup in front of her, then opened her mouth to speak once again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I tried to pull you up, but instead, you pushed me down the stairs. Did you really think that if I died from falling down the stairs, you would be able to ruin my reputation and then become the next rightful Young Mistress of the Zhan family?\u201dJiang Yuxi jumped up from her seat, triggered by what Jing Qian had said. She shouted furiously, \u201cJing Qian, you bloody liar! Did you really think that I would defame you without any evidence? You think grandfather would actually believe all the lies that you\u2019re spewing?\u201dThen, she quickly walked over to Master Zhan and said in a resentful and urgent tone, \u201cGrandfather, I\u2019m telling the truth about what happened this afternoon. I clearly overheard Jing Qian talking to her lover about taking advantage of the Zhan family\u2019s resources. She promised him that he would be a famous actor with her help. Jing Qian even bought things for her lover. I have a recording of it, listen! She was trying to delete this recording, which was why we were fighting when she tripped and fell down the stairs.\u201dAs she spoke, Jiang Yuxi unlocked her screen to try and show Master Zhan the video she had taken.Jing Qian let out a cold laugh, ignoring Jiang Yuxi as she continued to elegantly enjoy her food.\u201cWhere did it go? That\u2019s strange\u2026 Where\u2019s the video? What\u2014What\u2019s happening? It was right here!\u201dJiang Yuxi\u2019s face turned green as she searched for the video on her phone. She went through each interface on her phone but she was out of luck, as the video that she had saved was nowhere to be found.The video had disappeared into thin air!\u201cHmmm\u2026 You\u2019re studying fashion design, I\u2019ve heard. Was it because you realized that you\u2019re too ugly for acting and decided to give up on that? With your acting skills and the Zhan family\u2019s resources at your back, I\u2019m pretty confident that you can win the next Oscars.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be extremely pretty to be an actress, you know. Why don\u2019t you go for an audition? I\u2019m pretty sure that there will be directors who would appreciate having such a talented actress on set.\u201d\u201cJing! Qian! It was you, wasn\u2019t it? You were the one who deleted my video!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, it was me. I was talking to my paramour and you recorded it all. Becoming angry, I decided to start a fight with you then threw myself down the staircase and hit my head. While I was in the hospital for my head injury, I found someone to hack into your phone and delete all your recordings, which is why you can no longer show us the video that you clearly had before this.\u201dJing Qian said these things on purpose in order to further trigger Jiang Yuxi. Even if it was all true, she no longer had the evidence needed to prove it. It wouldn\u2019t matter if it was true or not.A smart person would have already realized what was happening.However, that was not the case for Jiang Yuxi.Her eyes widened and her entire face flushed with rage as she screamed, \u201cSO IT WAS YOU!\u201dJing Qian didn\u2019t know how to respond to that. This woman\u2019s brain must have been kicked by a mule for at least \u2026 three times?Jiang Yuxi then turned around and cried to Master Zhan, \u201cGrandfather, did you hear what she said? She admitted to it! It was her!\u201dZhan Yuheng, who was sitting by the side, couldn\u2019t take it anymore and put down his chopsticks as well.Before this, he had always thought that Jing Qian and Jiang Yuxi weren\u2019t on the same level when it came to intelligence.Today, they still weren\u2019t on the same level, but it was Jing Qian who unilaterally crushed Jiang Yuxi.\u201cThis matter shall end here. No one is allowed to mention this anymore.\u201dMaster Zhan was tired of it as well and immediately put an end to the conversation.Jiang Yuxi stared at him with her huge, tear-filled eyes. Her face was filled with disbelief and humiliation.\u201cWhy Grandfather, why? She already admitted that it was her! Why don\u2019t you punish her instead of asking me to shut up?!\u201dWasn\u2019t she just some woman who had a Ba-Zi that matched Brother Chuan\u2019s?

She stared blankly at the old man, no longer able to cry.This was the first time Master Zhan had ever talked to her so unceremoniously.Even though Jiang Yuxi\u2019s heart was filled with intense grief and dissatisfaction, with her understanding of Master Zhan, she knew that she could no longer say another word about it.If she continued, he would most likely chase her out of the house earlier than planned.But that particular sentence he said\u2014\u2019to abide by her role as guest\u2019\u2014truly hurt her heart.To her, she had become a part of the Zhan family from the moment she stepped into their household.She fell in love with Brother Chuan when she was 17 years old. Even now, when he\u2019d become a quadriplegic, there was never a moment where she disliked him.She even felt fortunate that he had been paralysed, because someone as brilliant as Brother Chuan would never have turned his attention to her.She had already lowered herself to this point, so why wouldn\u2019t grandfather see how good she was?She has been working hard, putting in so much effort to become the perfect woman. She had spent a great amount of time getting Brother Chuan to regain his hope and confidence. How could it simply be wiped out and forgotten?Jiang Yuxi had thought that what Master Zhan said before was harsh, but she soon realized that he could be much more ruthless.\u201cWhen you first came to the Zhan family, you yourself mentioned that you wouldn\u2019t mind staying in the guesthouse. Since there were no young mistresses back then, I relented and had Butler Xu arrange a room for you in the main building. However, the matter that Qianqian just brought up is sound. Now that Lichuan is a married man, it\u2019s indeed inappropriate for a single, unmarried girl to be allowed to enter and leave as you please in the main building. After finishing your meal, you should go pack up. I\u2019ll get Butler Xu to arrange an individual guest house for you.\u201dJiang Yuxi froze; it was so cold that she felt numb.Tears fell down her face like pearls off of a broken necklace.What had she done to deserve this?She wasn\u2019t the one who had an affair! Why was she the one being punished in the end?!However, Jiang Yuxi did not dare say another word.She never thought that Grandfather would be this muddled.But no matter what, she could only rely on him.Jing Qian\u2019s appetite suddenly became much better when watching Jiang Yuxi cry her eyes out.When Master Zhan and Zhan Yuheng came back to their senses, they were left speechless, realizing that most of the dishes on the table that were full before this had been cleared out within a short period of time.As Master Zhan looked at the woman eating elegantly, his head started to hurt all of a sudden. \u201cQianqian.\u201d\u201cEn?\u201d Jingqian responded to him while continuing to eat. Her actions were so natural, just like those of a granddaughter responding to her own grandfather.\u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d Master Zhan asked.\u201cJust a small wound. I\u2019m fine.\u201dMaster Zhan nodded his head and continued, \u201cWhile you were at the hospital, Lichuan returned from his physiotherapy session as well. He seems to be in a bad mood. Since you\u2019re his wife, you should really spend more time caring for him.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was an established matter since ancient times.Although she wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d received 100 million yuan earlier or benefited from it, she had still taken over Jing Qian\u2019s body and become her. Along with that, ever since she\u2019d entered this body, she had recovered from long-term depression, which was said to be incurable. To her, recovering from that disease was worth much more than 100 million yuan.Her life was indeed something precious!She would let them know that they had made the right choice when choosing her for this deal.Master Zhan knew deep inside that Jing Qian hadn\u2019t married into the Zhan family willingly.No matter how brilliant Lichuan was before this, he had now become a quadriplegic.However, he believed Master Jingyuan\u2019s words. He believed that as long as this lucky star stayed within their family, Lichuan\u2019s condition would improve.Therefore, even if he knew that Jing Qian was still in contact with her ex and was also aware that Jiang Yuxi had been wronged\u2026It didn\u2019t matter.As long as Lichuan\u2019s life improved, none of these things mattered.As for the rest\u2026 Getting rid of an ex-boyfriend of his granddaughter-in-law\u2019s, who didn\u2019t come from a good background, was a piece of cake.If Jing Qian truly refused to leave her ex-boyfriend, he could simply find ways to make the man leave her instead.Jiang Yuxi had lost her appetite at that point. Sobbing, she told the rest of them to enjoy their food then ran back to her room while crying.Upon seeing this scene, Butler Xu quietly exited the room.He had to make sure that Miss Jiang cleared out her bedroom.Master Zhan had also lost his appetite due to a bad mood after seeing the results of Zhan Lichuan\u2019s physiotherapy session. With the issue between Jiang Yuxi and Jing Qian now dealt with, he left the dining table.At this point, only Jing Qian and Zhan Yuheng remained at the table.When Zhan Yuheng saw that the other person was happily enjoying her meal, he naturally became very interested.\u201cLooks like you have a really good appetite today, sister-in-law.\u201dJing Qian continued to eat as she replied, \u201cI\u2019ve always had a good appetite.\u201dAfter struggling with depression for so many years, she hadn\u2019t enjoyed eating as much as she did today.This was the first time in at least a few years that she had enjoyed her food.Of course, it was also because the food was really delicious.\u201cIs that so?\u201d Zhan Yuheng asked in surprise. \u201cBut before this, you told me that you didn\u2019t eat very much.\u201dAfter finishing her rice and gulping down the last of her soup, she wiped her mouth and looked at Zhan Yuheng.Jing Qian replied indifferently, \u201cReally? Maybe it\u2019s the concussion. I don\u2019t really remember Young Master asking me this question. I\u2019m done now. Please enjoy the food.\u201dThen Jing Qian stood up, holding her head high as she walked out of the dining room.As he watched the enchanting figure that walked away like a queen, Zhan Yuheng couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. \u201cSuch a cunning rabbit! How come I never realized how interesting you are?\u201d******After dinner, Jing Qian decided that it was time for her to meet Zhan Lichuan, her \u2018husband\u2019.According to the memories of the previous owner, Zhan Lichuan was a quadriplegic with no future. So what if he was from a rich family? Being a quadriplegic meant that he was ultimately useless. Since the only people left in the family were the old man and his grandchildren, there was no one in between that could inherit. Once Master Zhan passed, Zhan Yuheng was next in line to inherit. Nothing would fall into the hands of this quadriplegic.That was why the previous owner of this body had wanted to get as much money and resources as she could before finding a way to run away with her soulmate.As for Zhan Lichuan\u2026 The previous owner didn\u2019t even know what he looked like, even if she had entered his room once.But she herself knew who Zhan Lichuan was.[Author\u2019s note: The male lead is a quadriplegic but he\u2019ll recover from it. Just wanted to give you guys a heads up.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Initially, the Zhan family had bought this place, which was near the city center, for property development. However, when Master Zhan noticed that Zhan Lichuan liked this place, he kept the 200 acres of land and transformed it into a mansion for the Zhan family.In H city, where every inch of land was gold and even senior white collars found it difficult to buy a one-bedroom suite, this mansion showed how loaded the Zhan family truly was.From what she could remember, the mansion had been divided into 12 sections, each with a unique garden style. As the favorite grandson of Master Zhan, the design and construction on Zhan Lichuan\u2019s terrace were quite laborious.Since their rooms were connected, they shared the same balcony. As she got closer to Zhan Lichuan\u2019s room, she noticed that the number of priceless orchids increased as well.There were even dozens of Ghost Orchids placed right outside of Zhan Lichuan\u2019s room.This species of orchid was one of the rarest found on Earth. Even among professional botanists, these orchids were priceless treasures; just one of them would cost a fortune.Seeing how this place was surrounded by them, as if they had been acquired for free, one could see how much Master Zhan loved his grandson.However\u2026After looking at the balcony, which looked like it was built for a prince from a fairytale, a meaningful look flashed across Jing Qian\u2019s eyes. Then, she pushed open the glass door that led to Zhan Lichuan\u2019s room.The door wasn\u2019t completely shut, so Jing Qian was able to casually walk in.Despite being quadriplegic, there were still a great deal of high-tech gadgets next to his bed.Noting the magnetic buckle on top of his head, Jing Qian assumed that it was some sort of high-tech gadget with a smart sensor.However, she didn\u2019t get a proper look to discern the gadgets, because once she stood in front of his bed, she was soon distracted by the attractive-looking man lying on it.As someone who appreciated good looks, Jing Qian approved of Zhan Lichuan\u2019s appearance.His deep facial features were sharp and defined, with a high nose and thin lips that were tightly pressed together. The warm light that shone on his face had washed out the cold, intimidating feeling that was once there, leaving only a trace of sickness and fragility.As Jing Qian took her time observing the man, still surprised by how good-looking he was, Zhan Lichuan\u2019s eyes, which had been tightly closed earlier, suddenly opened.His pitch-black eyes were as dark as a swamp, their whirlpool-like depths seemingly able to pull people into a bottomless quagmire.Even though he was just weakly lying in bed at the moment, the conceited aura that was released in that instant came with a breathtaking pressure. Jing Qian felt as if a sharp blade had pierced through her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, the one standing before him was a different person.She gave Zhan Lichuan a friendly smile, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re awake? I\u2019m guessing you haven\u2019t eaten dinner yet. Are you hungry?\u201dAs soon as a sound came from inside the room, both of the bodyguards guarding the living room dashed inside the bedroom.When they saw that it was Jing Qian, they looked extremely surprised.\u201cYoung master, we apologize. We didn\u2019t think Young Mistress would simply come in from the other door.\u201dEveryone knew that Jing Qian\u2019s room was attached to Zhan Lichuan\u2019s room, but for the past three weeks, she had not stepped into the Young Master\u2019s space once, which was why the guards didn\u2019t bother guarding the balcony. Instead, they guarded the living room, so that Jiang Yuxi would not be able to disturb their Young Master with all sorts of ridiculous excuses.No one expected that today, it would be Young Mistress who came barging into the room.Zhan Lichaun stared at Jing Qian.He figured that this woman must have accepted something from his grandfather, which would explain why she was coming in here to complete the mission she had been given. Initially, he couldn\u2019t be bothered to respond to her, but when he saw the friendly smile on her face, he realized that the look in her eyes was now different from the disgust, resistance, and avoidance from before.This time, her eyes were filled with kindness. A pair of charming, clarity-filled peach-blossom eyes were looking at him, with the vulgar look from before no longer present. However, she still managed to give off the seductive feeling that was coming from her bones.She was the same person, with the same smile as before, but this time, it showed a different level of flattery. The difference between low-grade and high-grade flattery was clearly distinguished and vividly interpreted.No wonder she had become an actress. She was really talented in acting in accordance with how much money she had been given.When he saw the bright, hopeful smile on her face, much like the sun during spring, Zhan Lichuan felt the urge to tear apart the facade with his bare hands.His future was dark and ruined; he wouldn\u2019t be needing this flattering smile, especially if it was a fake one.While looking at Jing Qian, Zhan Lichuan slowly responded, \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201dThe calm voice filled the spacious bedroom.Perhaps it was because it had been a long time since he had spoken, but he had a deep, hoarse voice with a sense of laziness to it, managing to sound powerful at the same time. It was like a voice that had traveled through the ancient Nile River, as it sounded ethereal, yet tangled with sadness. It gave off an unrealistic feeling, as if he was far away in the galaxy when he was actually right in front of them.When the bodyguards heard Zhan Lichuan talk, their eyes widened.This was the first sentence that Young Master had spoken in a few days. How could they not be happy about it?However, the sentence that followed once again brought the temperature of the atmosphere back to zero degrees.\u201cDon\u2019t you know that a quadriplegic doesn\u2019t feel hunger?\u201d Zhan Lichuan slowly asked.His glare was like a sharp knife; not only did it hurt the ones around him, it also hurt himself.His glare was like a demon-revealing mirror, intended to immediately break the perfect expression that Jing Qian had sculptured.But when she heard what Zhan Lichuan said, Jing Qian was unbothered. The friendly smile that she had put on was still there, not going away despite his words.The pair of charming eyes glistened, her voice soft yet captivating as she replied, \u201cWho said that a quadriplegic can\u2019t feel hunger? You injured your spine, which means that your peripheral nerves are injured. In other words, only the ones supplying your skeletal muscles are affected. Your sympathetic nerves, which control the movement of your digestive tract, are still intact. Therefore, even if you\u2019re a quadriplegic, you can still feel hunger.\u201cIf you\u2019re hungry but refuse to eat, your body\u2019s metabolic rate will fall and start breaking down the proteins in your muscle, using it as the body\u2019s energy supply. This will result in your bones and muscles becoming atrophied. This is why it\u2019s very important for you to eat.\u201dZhan Lichuan was left speechless.He didn\u2019t see the broken expression that he had expected. Rather, this woman was still looking at him with that flattering smile, which was very startling. It was so bright, it almost blinded him.Zhan Lichuan closed his eyes once again. All of a sudden, he no longer wanted to speak.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He\u2019s already unwell to begin with, so why torture himself and make things even more uncomfortable? Additionally, when your nerves recover in the future, if you have enough muscles, it\u2019ll be easier for you to regain your strength during physiotherapy.\u201dMaster Zhan, agreeing with what Jing Qian said, instantly lectured his grandson, \u201cAh Chuan, did you hear what she said? Even Jing Qian said that once your nerves recover, you\u2019ll need the strength for physiotherapy. If you don\u2019t eat, your stamina and muscles will be depleted.\u201dZhan Lichuan opened his eyes and looked at Jing Qian with his pair of deep, pitch-black eyes that were unmoved. He said emotionlessly, \u201cIs she a doctor?\u201dMaster Zhan was speechless.Jing Qian maintained her smile and said, \u201cYou mustn\u2019t look down on other people, Young Master. I may not be a doctor, but there are all sorts of excellent doctors and masters in this world. Who knows, it\u2019s hard to say that you will be a lucky one and get to meet one of them.\u201dThese words pleased the old man\u2019s heart, and he quickly said, \u201cShe\u2019s right, Ah Chuan. I was just\u2026\u201d\u201cGrandfather, I need to talk to you in private.\u201dZhan Lichuan was aware of how Jing Qian became his wife; he was also clear as to why she was here in his room, saying all of this to him.He knew it was all his grandfather\u2019s good intentions, but he really didn\u2019t want the concerns of a stranger who came to him because of money.\u201cGrandfather, I\u2019ll leave so that you can both talk.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dMaster Zhan suddenly looked unpleasant and there was a look of struggle in his eyes; he didn\u2019t want Jing Qian to leave. He had a bad feeling after hearing what his grandson said.As Jing Qian walked out of the room, followed by the guards, only Zhan Lichuan and Master Zhan were left in the room. Before Zhan Lichuan could say anything, Master Zhan immediately broke the depressing atmosphere in the room, which was unbearable. \u201cWhat do you think about Jing Qian? Master Jingyuan said that your lifeline is too tough, which is why it\u2019ll break very easily, and not to mention that it\u2019s also deadly. Jing Qian, however, is your opposite. Her life is of extreme \u2018yin\u2019, which is a perfect match to yours, since you are of extreme \u2018yang\u2019. With both of yours combined, you\u2019ll be able to overcome all sorts of obstacles in life. Master Jingyuan has always been very accurate about this. Ah Chuan, now that she has become your wife, I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ll get better soon.\u201dZhan Lichuan\u2019s throat moved. His deep, dark eyes looked gentle, but he still spoke the cruelest words. \u201cGrandfather, the doctor has already declared my impending death. Why are you being so stubborn? For the past three months, I have been trying my best to rehabilitate because I didn\u2019t want to disappoint you. But\u2026 It hurts so much. Please, just euthanize me.\u201dAlthough this was a plea, Master Zhan could hear the determination and despair in his voice.With that, the entire room went into pin-drop silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He knew by asking him for this he had done something very cruel to his grandfather, but now that he was in this condition, he could no longer contribute to the Zhan family. Instead of laying on the bed every day and staring at the ceiling from morning till nightfall, he would rather end his life and be relieved from this, once and for all.However, in his current state, he couldn\u2019t do it on his own.\u201cAh Chuan, you will get better soon! You have to trust grandfather on this. I\u2019ve found someone who can help you! Please don\u2019t give up\u2026. Without you, what\u2019s the point of me being alive then? You\u2019re everything that I have, don\u2019t you know that?\u201d Master Zhan pleaded with tears running down his face.\u201cGrandfather, even without me, you\u2019d still have Big Brother and Second Sister\u2026\u201d\u201cNo! I only want you! I don\u2019t care about money, power, or fame; I can give up all of that as long as you stay with me. Ah Chuan, please\u2026. I\u2019m begging you\u2026\u201dZhan Lichuan replied with a calm, emotionless voice.\u201cBut it hurts\u2026. I have to deal with the fact that I\u2019m useless and incompetent every moment of every day.\u201d\u201cHow are you incompetent? You\u2019re just physically powerless at worst, that\u2019s all. Everyone can see how capable you actually are. Look at the other quadriplegics\u2014they\u2019re forced to bear with the pain of losing control over their bowels and bladder. There\u2019s nothing they can do other than lay in bed. But then look at you! When you became a quadriplegic, you immediately designed a customized computer system, letting it convey all the information from your body through your brain. You\u2019re even in control of the entire corporation with this computer. As for your daily needs, you have specialized robots that take care of everything. Look at all that you\u2019ve done. Even in this condition, you\u2019re still so capable. You haven\u2019t even asked for anyone\u2019s help and have been taking good care of yourself. Just how are you useless?\u201d\u201cBut grandfather, I can\u2019t stand someone else touching my body, even if it\u2019s just a machine. And what I really can\u2019t bear is the fact that all I do each day is lay on this bed motionlessly. From the moment I wake up, the next thing I do is fall asleep. Every minute in between is torture for me.\u201d\u201cThis is just temporary, everything will get better soon!\u201d Master Zhan was crying as he continued begging.However, Zhan Lichuan shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m always the first to see my report after every session of physiotherapy.\u201dMaster Zhan\u2019s heart sank and his face turned white.He had already warned them over and over again and had even gotten hackers to put up firewalls so that he could prevent Lichuan from seeing it.Ah Chuan, why are you so capable?Even as a quadriplegic, he could still hack the firewall with just his brainwaves.\u201cNo matter how hard I try, my recovery chances are still at a zero. The best-case scenario is the recovery of some small nerves in my fingers, but all I\u2019ll be able to do is move my fingers a little. Grandfather, if that\u2019s how my life is going to be\u2026. I\u2019d rather not have it.\u201d\u201cNo! No!\u201d Master Zhan shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s still a chance, Ah Chuan!\u201dThen, he opened up the tablet that was in his hand and pulled up an email. He showed it to Lichuan and said:\u201cLook at this man. His name is Hei Zelin, and he\u2019s an expert con man. This man once traveled to all the casinos in NHD state and never lost a single bet. Within three days, he won up to hundreds of millions of yuan and offended a lot of people there. This resulted in him being targeted. His bones were all excavated from his body and the tendons in all four of his limbs were severed. Initially, the only thing they could do was an amputation, but then, he found Saka, Master of the Tang Sect. Look at him now; even though most of the bones in his hands and legs are artificially installed, they\u2019re miraculously bound to his nerves. He can walk and do things just like a normal person. It can even be said that the injury back then did not bring him any bad sequelae.\u201cPreviously, this person also hired a lot of specialists from all over the country for consultation, but all of them said that he had no other choice but to do an amputation. This is enough proof that Saka\u2019s medical skills are incredibly talented. As long as Saka agrees to treat you, you\u2019ll definitely recover from this! We\u2019re not just talking about your fingers; it\u2019ll also be possible for you to walk like a normal person again!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When I found out about Saka, I immediately sent someone to River Delta and sought her help. If she agrees, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll recover in no time.\u201dZhan Lichuan did not say anything. Although it looked like he wasn\u2019t doing anything, the screen that was diagonally placed above him lit up as if it were commanded by something, and numbers filled the screen.The numbers rapidly moved across the screen. Then, the huge LED screen placed in front of the bed turned on.Zhan Lichuan finally said, \u201cThis was the biggest piece of news this evening.\u201dThe screen displayed a beautiful scene of the beach. On the cliff next to it, there was a villa that was made up of some kind of special material.The transparent villa hung at the edge of the cliff, where the waves hit it from below. It looked extremely dangerous, but any expert would know that the material used to make the villa was so strong that even a bomb couldn\u2019t break it apart.However, this building that was as strong as a metal box was now in ruins. There was only one small part left hanging on the cliff. As for the rest, including the cliff next to it, it had been completely destroyed.There were countless helicopters and rescue boats searching on the sea. A reporter was reporting about the news on one of the helicopters.\u201cAt 4 AM, a major explosion occurred on S island, located on 62.2\u00b0 north latitude, 152.9\u00b0 west longitude. There was only one villa found on the island, and the centre of the explosion was also at this same villa.\u201cFrom what we know now, this villa was one of the properties that belonged to the mysterious Master of the Tang Sect, Saka. Before this, one of our reporters confirmed with Saka\u2019s sister, Miss Dong Yuetong, that when the explosion happened, Master Saka was at this exact villa. This seems to have been a deliberate murder, and the police force of Country M has intervened to investigate this matter.\u201dMaster Zhan stared at the news that was being broadcasted on the screen. He couldn\u2019t believe that the hope that had just been ignited in him was now broken into pieces.\u201cMaster Saka was a legend. Her short but stunning life had been controversial. She was the 177th descendant of the Tang Sect, which was originally an ancient medical clan that came from Country Z. As their descendant, Saka had the skills to bring a dead man back to life and was a genius in both medicine and poison. She owned countless hospitals, biotechnology companies, real estate, gambling, and jewelry industries. Her net worth was immeasurable.\u201cHowever, Saka was a peculiar person. Although she was an expert in the medical field, there were many times where she refused to save the ones in need. It was a common occurrence for her to ask for a fortune in order for her help, and she lacked medical ethics. Hence, she offended a lot of people in her past. Regarding this explosion, her sister, Miss Dong, suspects that this was done by someone whom Saka must have offended and is now seeking revenge. Further investigation is needed, however, to find out who is behind this murder.\u201cSaka\u2019s name came from the word Manjusaka, also known as Lycoris. It\u2019s said that this flower means the calling from hell, the guide of the dead. Perhaps Saka saw this coming when she named herself after the flower?\u201cSaka was the Master of the Tang Sect, so will her death cause an uproar in the Tang Sect? Are there any other descendants of the Tang Sect after her? We have interviewed Miss Dong Yuetong, the younger sister of Saka, regarding this matter.\u201dThe scene switched to a beautiful woman who had an alluring figure. Her eyes were swollen, and her face was filled with grief and anger.As she looked into the camera, she spoke in a firm voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2019re all wrong! Even if my sister is dead, the Tang Sect still has me! God is watching you. I don\u2019t care who it is, but the Tang Sect will get to the bottom of this! We will take revenge! We will make them pay for what they did!\u201dMaster Zhan\u2019s eyes glowed with hope again as he said, \u201cLichuan, see? Saka\u2019s sister is also a descendant of the Tang Sect. She said she\u2019s just like Saka. She has also completely inherited her master\u2019s mantle.\u201dZhan Lichuan\u2019s eyes remained cold, and there were no signs of excitement even after hearing what Dong Yuetong said.\u201cI\u2019ve only heard of Saka and just found out that she was from the Tang Sect after looking into it. Grandfather, if it wasn\u2019t because of Saka, would you have known about the Tang Sect or Dong Yuetong? Let\u2019s put it the other way around; do you even know who Saka\u2019s master is?\u201dMaster Zhan became speechless.In the other room, Jing Qian also watched the international news that was being broadcasted. When she heard what the woman was saying, the lips that were originally curled upwards were now showing a cold, enchanting smile. She was no longer interested in what the woman had to say next or what was about to happen, so she turned off the television.At this moment, Butler Xu walked in with the family physician to change the dressing on her forehead and to check up on her. Jing Qian saw her chance, and with a bright smile on her face, asked, \u201cButler Xu, might there be rats in our garden? Could you get me some fat, healthy ones?When Butler Xu saw this woman\u2019s dazzling eyes and slender figure, a movie he had watched as a child appeared in his mind.In that movie, the captivating green snake was also very alluring. She would be talking and laughing with someone at first, but at the very next moment, she would stick out her poisonous fangs, catch a fat rat with her long tongue, and swallow it in one breath.Now that he was staring at their Young Mistress, who was almost as beautiful as the green snake, he couldn\u2019t help but shiver and carefully ask, \u201cYoung Mistress, may I know why you want these rats?\u201dHe was the one who\u2019d interacted with Young Mistress the most.Master Zhan and the Third Young Master may not see the change in Young Mistress, but he could.Ever since she woke up after falling down the stairs, the Young Mistress\u2019s temperament was different.She had become devilish.She was even asking for rats now.He couldn\u2019t help but overthink this matter.Jing Qian laughed when she heard Butler Xu\u2019s question, \u201cWell, obviously, I want to play with them. Did you think that I was going to eat them?\u201d\u2018Listen! Listen! Do you hear what she said?!\u2019This beautiful girl was asking for rats so that she could play with them, and she even talked about eating them. Most people would only want these rats for experiments! Yet, here she was, thinking about playing with them and eating them.Butler Xu felt his scalp turn numb, as he was frightened by his bold assumptions.\u201cYoung Mistress, if you want something to play with, why don\u2019t you choose white mice instead? They\u2019re much cleaner than rats. These rats are extremely dirty.\u201d\u201cWhite mice are cute, and it would be a waste if they died. Rats, please! Butler Xu, could you please get me some? Remember to get some that are fat and healthy.\u201dButler Xu\u2019s mind was now filled with images of \u2018fat\u2019 and \u2018healthy\u2019 rats being eaten.Should he\u2026 Tell Master Zhan about his assumption?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Don\u2019t worry, Young Mistress, I\u2019ve already prepared the other room for her.\u201dThis meant that no matter how hard she tried to delay it, she\u2019d be moving out tonight.Satisfied with the answer she received, Jing Qian stood up.\u201cI\u2019d like to take a walk in the garden. I think it\u2019d be best for me to go over there and comfort her.\u201dButler Xu remained silent, but in his head, he wondered, \u2018Are you sure you\u2019re going to comfort her? Or are you trying to kill her?\u2019Jiang Yuxi\u2019s room wasn\u2019t too far from their bedroom.As she walked past the corridor and came to the other side of the mansion, Jing Qian saw Jiang Yuxi, who really wanted to stay, packing up the rest of her things.When she saw Jing Qian walking towards her, a look of hatred flashed across her eyes. She sneered, \u201cLook at what you\u2019ve done to me! Are you happy now?\u201dJing Qian looked at the woman who had a twisted expression on her face simply because she was no longer allowed to live in the main building and bluntly replied, \u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201dJiang Yuxi was enraged.Her chest started moving up and down dramatically after being triggered by this b*tch, and she was almost screaming. \u201cJing Qian! You don\u2019t even like Brother Chuan! So, why can\u2019t you just let me have him?\u201d\u201cLook at how you\u2019re exploding. You\u2019re saying this as if he\u2019ll be yours even if I allowed it. If you were that great, you wouldn\u2019t have been a guest in this house despite living in it for more than five years.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Jiang Yuxi wasn\u2019t only panting with rage, as her face now flushed with humiliation as well.\u201cCalm down, I just came over to check up on your progress. Don\u2019t think that you\u2019ll get to stay another day just because you couldn\u2019t move everything out by tonight. I\u2019ve asked them, and the other room is already prepared for you. Get over there, wash up, and get a good night\u2019s sleep. Try to avoid showing up in front of me from now on.\u201dJiang Yuxi was too infuriated to speak, knowing that this woman was deliberately making things difficult for her. How could she be so arrogant?!When she was about to leave, Jiang Yuxi stopped her. \u201cJing Qian! Stop right there!\u201dAlthough Jing Qian wasn\u2019t willing to, she could see that this b*tch was a petty person. She wouldn\u2019t gain anything other than trouble if she were to fight her.Jiang Yuxi stood in front of Jing Qian and confronted her. \u201cYou yourself know whether or not you have a lover, or if I was framing you. Jing Qian, I can pretend that today never happened and we\u2019ll never talk about it again. You have someone you like, and I have someone I like. We shouldn\u2019t be fighting each other when we can both benefit from this. Why don\u2019t you let me have Brother Chuan? I won\u2019t pay mind to you having a lover outside. If you want to take advantage of the Zhan family, I\u2019ll even help you with that. What do you think?\u201dJing Qian looked at Jiang Yuxi, who was acting like she was such an honorable, kind person for offering a truce.She replied in a disgusted tone, \u201cNow that you\u2019ve realized you\u2019re not smart enough to defeat me, you\u2019ve come up with a different plan? Help me? How? What identity would you use to help me? As the guest who\u2019s about to leave the Zhan family? Hmm\u2026 Let\u2019s not talk about whether or not I have a lover outside. Even if I do, I wouldn\u2019t deal with someone who is useless and has no value.\u201dAfter that, she didn\u2019t even bother looking at Jiang Yuxi, who was trembling in rage. She twisted her slender waist along with her cute butt and walked down the stairs like a queen.This woman knew of her obsession and repeatedly mentioned that she was simply a guest!\u201cJing Qian! Stop being such a b*tch!\u201dHowever, the curvy figure that was walking away didn\u2019t bother responding to her.Butler Xu, who was hiding in the dark, was afraid that a murder scene might occur.

Instead, she was now dressed in a loose, white, cashmere, round-necked sweater, paired with some jeans and a pair of white velvet Hermes slippers.Her long, chestnut-colored hair was slightly curled and lazily scattered on one side. As she walked down the stairs, it gently moved around her shoulder and fair, swan-like neck.While she was walking, her slender waist, which was partly hidden, now looked more graceful than before. The effect was even more charming and attractive than the tight-fitting dress from before.She had minimal makeup on, but it was delicate and suited her well. Her eyebrows gave her a graceful look, and even when they were paired with her bright, glamorous eyes, the effect was surprisingly natural.Zhan Yuheng felt that this woman in front of him was like a banshee from those old mansions, one who went around sucking human spirits.Her each and every movement was filled with a devilish charm.\u201cWhere are you off to, sister-in-law?\u201d\u201cJust going for a walk.\u201dJing Qian walked in a casual, lazy manner and she had a drawl as she spoke. Her voice was like a feather brushing his heart and leaving an itch when it was gone.\u201cYou\u2019re going out for a walk now? When it\u2019s so cold outside?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s cold outside? I don\u2019t feel it.\u201dWith that, Jing Qian swiftly walked past him like an elf.As he looked at her retreating figure, Zhan Yuheng was captivated.It had been three weeks since Jing Qian had married into the Zhan Family. Before this, he thought that all she had were good looks, and even then, she was not attractive to him.After all, as the current Young Master of the richest family in H city, as long as he wanted them to, all the celebrities would stick to him, similar to how bees were attracted to honey. Hence, when he was told that grandfather had found an actress for his brother, he mocked the decision, saying that it was an embarrassment.But today, Jing Qian\u2019s every smile and frown kept reappearing in his head, refusing to go away.Zhan Yuheng only came back to his senses when he heard footsteps coming from the stairs. When he looked up, he saw Jiang Yuxi, who had a gloomy look on her face.He raised his brows and walked up the stairs. As he went past her, he was stopped.\u201cYuxi, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Zhan Yuheng smiled as he questioned her.\u201cBig brother, everything that I said today is true. Although I have no idea how my recordings disappeared, Jing Qian really has a lover outside! You\u2019ve got to trust me!\u201d\u201cYuxi, it doesn\u2019t matter whether I trust you or not. The important thing here is that you have no evidence and Jing Qian is the granddaughter-in-law of the Zhan family. You can\u2019t just go around slandering her. Have a good night.\u201dThen, Zhan Yuheng went upstairs.Jiang Yuxi had initially planned to ally herself with Zhan Yuheng. However, when she saw that he would rather stare at Jing Qian and not even bother to listen to her, she became angry once again.******The Zhan family\u2019s mansion was actually very famous worldwide, as every spot in the house was filled with the utmost elegance and refinement.No matter where you stood, from your point of view, it would become scenery.The design itself was breathtaking. In addition to that, it had perfectly integrated garden art with the classical elements of Country Z. Most of the top garden designers wanted the drawings of this mansion so that they could learn about its intricate designs.However, all of it was single-handedly designed by Zhan Lichuan, who was a business degree graduate that had nothing to do with garden designing.Most outsiders would assume that the Zhan family became so established because of the old Chairman, Zhan Renhao. However, only senior executives in the industry knew that Zhan Renhao was only responsible for strengthening the corporation. It was Zhan Lichuan, the quadriplegic laying on the bed now, who made them the richest family in H city.This perfectly described how brilliant Zhan Lichuan was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Other than the technology industry, they also owned several others, such as property, entertainment, hospitals, department stores, hotels, etc. He was the complete package when it came to being an established businessman.However, an accident changed his entire life. The injury to his spine had turned him into a useless quadriplegic.No one would be able to accept this, let alone Zhan Lichuan himself.Even Jing Qian found the change difficult. When she saw Zhan Lichuan in his current state and compared it to the attractive scene from when she first saw him at the dinner for when he became the executive chairman, she couldn\u2019t help but sigh.He was a phoenix with a broken wing.But being alive was the most important thing. Without that, you\u2019d have nothing.For now, though, Jing Qian drove around the mansion in the Zhan family shuttle bus. She admired the beautiful, ancient scenery under the moonlight as if she had teleported back to the olden days. With the moon shining bright above her, she took a deep breath of air, which was filled with freedom and vitality. Although it hadn\u2019t been long since her rebirth, she had already started questioning why she wanted to kill herself in her previous life. Why couldn\u2019t she jump out of it?Wasn\u2019t life beautiful?Wasn\u2019t it nice having so much money?She had fortune, fame, power, and good looks, so why was she still so depressed?She had no idea how she became depressed when she had this sort of personality, but by the time she realized that something was wrong, her emotions were already out of control.This was why she was always looking for ways to die. She was always trying to make others livid at her so that they would try to kill her.Once a perfect life reaches a dead end, it is hard to come out of it.Luckily, God gave her a second chance. Now that she had changed the core and was no longer depressed, life instantly became wonderful.The mellow and radiant moonlight shone onto the ground. It was so bright that it looked as if mercury had spilled all over it. Jing Qian\u2019s shadow stretched long and thin as she picked out flowers from the garden.There were a lot of plants in the Zhan mansion. She picked those that she needed, placed them in the shuttle bus, and went to the next location.Just when she got everything that she needed, her phone rang.She looked at the phone, which used to be fully bedazzled, and saw that it was an unknown number.As she picked up the phone and answered, a man\u2019s voice appeared on the other end.\u201cQianqian, are you free to talk now?\u201dIt was an unknown number, but the person on the other end was speaking to her with familiarity. Jing Qian couldn\u2019t tell who it was but answered the person shortly, \u201cEn.\u201d\u201cWhat happened this afternoon? Was there someone outside? Did they find out about us?\u201dThe other person\u2019s voice sounded anxious and nervous.Jing Qian\u2019s brain, which was confused at first, instantly realized who this person was.This person was called Qin Yi, who was supposedly in a relationship with the previous owner of this body. During freshman year, Qin Yi was recruited by an entertainment company and became a member of a group called Funik.Initially, Funik was a flop. They weren\u2019t a big hit until last year, when a director took a fancy to the beauty of the previous owner and decided to give her a role as the second lead in his drama. The previous owner even introduced Qin Yi to the director.This drama was based on a classic novel, but due to certain reasons, it didn\u2019t get released and could only be placed online as a web series. There weren\u2019t many investors for it, which caused dissatisfaction amongst the fans, who had rejected the idea of turning it from a novel into a web series in the first place. The fans felt that there were no celebrities good enough to be the male lead for the series, which was why anyone who decided to take up the role of the male lead would be hated before shooting even began.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When the director saw that Qin Yi fit the role and he could cut down on expenses, he decided to bring him on as the main lead.Fortunately, the web series was a hit. After that, Qin Yi continuously appeared in two other variety shows. Now, he had become the hotshot of the entertainment industry in the country, gaining 11 million fans within a year.When the Zhan family found Jing Qian and asked her to marry their quadriplegic grandson to help counteract his bad luck, the previous owner had originally refused. In the end, however, she ended up agreeing to the marriage, one of the main reasons being that she wanted to help Qin Yi.Qin Yi was a handsome, sunny young man, the type of guy that was most popular among younger girls these days. He already had a certain amount of fame and a fanbase; the only thing he lacked was resources. If he could act in a few more hit series, he would be able to successfully transform from an idol into an actor. Then, if he got noticed by any of the movie investors, his life would be smooth sailing from then onwards.Since the Zhan family\u2019s Op Corporation owned Zhongbo Entertainment, which was one of the top three entertainment groups in Country Z, they had the most resources.Qin Yi had his eyes on the high-end resources that the Zhan family possessed. The previous owner was duped by Qin Yi and ended up marrying into the Zhan family for the sake of her boyfriend\u2019s career.She, on the other hand, was not the previous owner at all. There weren\u2019t many memories left between the two of them. As a result, she didn\u2019t remember how this bastard had convinced the previous owner into marrying herself into the Zhan family.The only thing she could remember now was how much the previous owner had done for him. Not only did she agree to the marriage in order to get him more resources, but she had also spent quite a lot of money on him.However, now that she had taken over this body, the previous owner\u2019s money was her money.For someone like her, who used to not care about her life, money was currently her top priority.\u201cDid you borrow fifty million yuan from me before?\u201dAlthough the man sounded anxious on the phone, the truth was that he was lying naked in bed. As he rested his head on the side of the bed, a quilt covered the private parts of his body, and a lustful scent permeated through the air, matching the look of pleasure on his face.He was hugging onto a thin, fair, weak woman with one hand, and in the other, he held onto his phone along with a lit cigarette. He looked extremely comfortable in this position.Just as he was about to drop the cigarette butt onto the ashtray, he heard that earth-shattering question. His entire body was stunned, and his hands shook. The hot soot from the cigarette butt fell from his hand and onto his neck, causing him to immediately gasp and jump up after being burnt.The woman who was in his arms became frightened by the sudden movement, her breathing becoming heavy as well.When she saw what happened, she quickly swept off the burning soot that was present on his neck.All of these little movements and actions were clearly audible over the phone.Jing Qian couldn\u2019t help but raise her brows.What the f*ck?!The previous owner was betrayed and sold out while she was busy helping them earn a fortune!Unable to believe his ears, he asked again, \u201cQianqian, what was it that you were asking?\u201dJing Qian repeated in a kinder manner, \u201cDid you borrow fifty million yuan from me?\u201d\u201cWhen did I borrow money from you? Qianqian, what are you talking about? Are you sure you\u2019re free to talk right now?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure. Remember when I first came to the Zhan family? You told me that your mom or one of your relatives needed money, which was why you borrowed fifty million from me.\u201dQin Yi remained silent.He did borrow money from her, but it wasn\u2019t fifty million. It was only twenty million, and he hadn\u2019t planned on returning the money to her anytime soon.Years of habit allowed him to develop a consensus between the two of them \u2014 anything that belonged to Jing Qian was his as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As he related it to what happened in the afternoon, his heart sank.He was worried that Jing Qian might have messed up, and Master Zhan had found out about their relationship\u2014and as a result, was asking for all the money that he had given. His brain exploded and he instantly denied things. \u201cQianqian, I think you\u2019ve got it wrong. When did I ever borrow money from you?\u201dAs the burnt area on his shoulder turned red and he felt the pain, Qin Yi\u2019s mood turned bad and his voice became heavier. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering my question? Did something happen to you?\u201d\u201cNothing happened.\u201d Jing Qian was leisurely talking on the phone as she broke a branch off of the Osmanthus tree beside her.\u201cIf nothing\u2019s wrong, why are you asking me this? Jing Qian, this isn\u2019t a joke!\u201d Qin Yi\u2019s tone had turned cold.Usually, whenever Jing Qian heard Qin Yi\u2019s tone that tried to suppress his anger, she would immediately give in to him. Over the years, he had used her unconditional love for him to step into the commanding position in their relationship.However, the Jing Qian that he was talking to was no longer the same one from before.She had no memory of exactly how much this man had borrowed from her. Jing Qian realized that if it was something that the previous owner didn\u2019t care about, she wouldn\u2019t have many memories of it.This showed that the previous owner didn\u2019t see Qin Yi as an outsider, as she didn\u2019t have any memory of it after lending him such a huge amount of money. The only thing that she remembered about him was all the fake sweet nothings that he would say to her.Even so, she still had a vague memory of this man asking her for money. Therefore, she decided to randomly pick a huge amount, just so that she wouldn\u2019t be taken advantage of.Who knew that this **green tea would dare to scream at her!This bastard wasn\u2019t even treating his sugar mommy right. Was he still human?Even if he was having an affair behind her back, he should at least be mindful and professional about it!This bastard was a war machine amongst the green teas.Jing Qian was very contemptuous of such people, which was why she asked in righteous retaliation, \u201cJoke? Who\u2019s joking with you? Am I someone who would joke about money?\u201dQin Yi was left very confused at her response.She was a woman who cared more about love than anything else. Although she didn\u2019t treat money like rubbish, she was still someone who didn\u2019t like talking about money. Why did it feel as if something wasn\u2019t right?\u201cYou should know better than anyone whether or not you borrowed money from me. What\u2019s wrong? You were acting all sweet and kind when you wanted me to marry into the Zhan family and when you borrowed money from me. Now you\u2019re acting up just because I asked about it?\u201dQin Yi was shocked, but he didn\u2019t have time to respond to her words before she began to speak again.\u201cA**hole, I\u2019m telling you that I don\u2019t have that much patience. When I count to three, you better tell me how much money you borrowed. Otherwise, you won\u2019t be able to blame me for not giving you a chance for old times\u2019 sake!\u201dQin Yi, who had still been in a rage just a few seconds ago, became so frightened that his soul left his body when Jing Qian screamed at him.Although he hadn\u2019t treated her right and would always scream at her, he knew very well that he depended on this woman for all his future developments.No matter how bad-tempered he was before, she always trusted him unconditionally and would even tolerate him. Why was she suddenly being so mean to him today?The main problem was, what did he do? Why was she talking about \u2018old times\u2019 sake?\u2019\u201cQianqian, what\u2019s wrong with you? What happened? You have to let me know so we can face it together. With you acting like this\u2026. I don\u2019t even know what to do.\u201d\u201cCut it with the bullsh*t.

Therefore, that sister of hers assumed that everything belonging to the previous owner was also hers.From this, she could assume that the previous owner\u2019s sister liked Qin Yi as well. Even if she didn\u2019t, she would take him as if Qin Yi belonged to her as well.The woman next to Qin Yi at the moment was likely Xiao Lu.As she thought about it, Jing Qian raised her brows in interest and decided that tonight\u2026\u2026 nevermind. She\u2019d help the previous owner confirm her assumptions tomorrow.From the moment she made the decision, her head started hurting and an inexplicable consciousness suddenly resented the decision.As she vigorously massaged her temples, Jing Qian was even more convinced that she has to get it done tomorrow morning!The shooting pain was then washed away by her overruling thought.Jing Qian, who was a little unhappy from the earlier pain, continued speaking in a calm tone, but this time with her unique, amorous drawl.\u201cBut what she says doesn\u2019t count.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Qin Yi unconsciously asked.\u201cThe two of you are a hand in gloves. If she\u2019s your witness, what\u2019s the difference between that and getting a dog to be your witness?\u201dQin Yi was shocked, but the woman next to him was even more so.He saw the face of the woman in front of him turn from frightened, helpless, and enraged to immensely sad. It even got to the point that she was covering her chest with her hands while panting. Her lips had turned pale and she looked incredibly pitiful. Qin Yi couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cQianqian, what\u2019s wrong with you? You\u2019re acting really strange tonight. Did you lose your memory from a car accident, or have you somehow misunderstood things between me and Xiao Lu?\u201dThe other party replied in a kind, soft voice, \u201cWhy? Is there anything going on between the two of you that could cause unnecessary misunderstanding?\u201dBoth Qin Yi and the woman\u2019s scalps turned numb. Qin Yi angrily denied her words, \u201cOf course not! I, Qin Yi, only have you, Jing Qian, as my girlfriend. Even though you\u2019re a part of the Zhan family now, I\u2019m still upholding the promise between us.\u201d\u201cWhat promise? Which line?\u201d\u2013** TL note: White lotus b*tch \u2014 another interesting term to describe certain traits of a woman who usually pretends to be innocent and weak when they are actually not.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I will only love you, and that\u2019s something that will never change.The woman next to him was panting and her face had turned pale. She was biting onto her lips as her face was filled with fury, shame, and injustice.\u201cBut Jing Qian, the things that you said just now were too much. Not only did you insult me, you insulted Xiao Lu as well. You even called her a\u2026 Don\u2019t you think that you were too harsh about it?\u201dWhen she heard that firm, loud tone calling her by her full name, trying to be righteous despite the uneven breathing sounds that could be heard faintly over the phone, Jing Qian laughed out loud.Her laughter was melodious. It was just like a banshee who had suddenly appeared in the mountain valleys, teasing the mundane peasants who were passing by.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? She\u2019s not here anyways. Who hasn\u2019t said a few bad things behind the backs of others?

Do you think that she\u2019s better than me?\u201d\u201cOf course not!\u201d Qin Yi immediately denied.\u201cAlright then. You have to remember what you promised me tonight! I take promises very seriously. Don\u2019t let me find out that you have betrayed me with those b*tches. Otherwise, compared to the thunder and lightning that you\u2019ll get for breaking a promise, my revenge will be even worse. You have to remember that I\u2019m your \u201cinvestor\u201d now. If I get tired of you, your entire fortune and all of your resources will go down the drain. Understood?\u201dQin Yi was shocked beyond words.Forget about the woman panting uncontrollably next to him. Qin Yi himself felt that he was going to have a heart attack after being triggered by this woman.She had threatened him!This b*tch had dared to threaten him!If he hadn\u2019t been sure that the number and the voice both belonged to Jing Qian, he would have thought that he had been talking to a ghost instead.Before Qin Yi could say anything, Jing Qian had already ended the call.Seeing that the only sound coming from the phone was \u2018tututu,\u2019 and that it had gone back to its home screen, Qin Yi was shocked.He wasn\u2019t done talking yet!After making sure that Jing Qian had already hung up the phone, the woman, pale from being insulted, immediately started crying.\u201cBrother Qin, big sister was being so mean! She\u2026 She called me a dog. She always stood up for me and protected me, but I can\u2019t believe that she secretly hates me. Huhuhu\u2026 How could she be so mean?\u201dQin Yi was extremely irritable after being threatened by Jing Qian, but when he saw the weak, helpless look on the woman in front of him, he immediately softened.He gathered the crying woman, holding her in his hands. She was so soft, her body like weightless cotton. As her tears flowed down to his chest, it imprinted upon his heart.\u201cThere, there. Stop crying. It\u2019s entirely Jing Qian\u2019s fault tonight. Don\u2019t think too much about it.\u201d\u201cEn, I understand. Now that big sister belongs to Zhan Lichuan, she must be unhappy. Who on earth would want to marry a quadriplegic?! She only agreed to this because of you and our family, which is why she\u2019s so angry. She\u2019s in the upper class now. She has the right to look down on us and judge us. I understand.\u201dJing Lu, who was lying in Qin Yi\u2019s arms, continued sobbing as she tried to defend Jing Qian.However, it only served to fuel the flames in Qin Yi\u2019s heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Initially, he had felt guilty about it, but after tonight, all the guilt that he had felt disappeared into thin air.Especially considering the last sentence she had said before hanging up\u2026They were a couple! Since when did it all depended on what she said? She was his \u2018sugar mummy\u2019?!Then what did that make him?A strong sense of humiliation spontaneously overcame him.When she felt the man\u2019s body getting stiffer around her, Jing Lu knew that her words had worked, which was why she continued, \u201cBut, big sister was too much. It\u2019s okay if she wanted to scream at me but how could she be so mean to you? She even wanted you to return the money\u2026. When she wasn\u2019t married, you were the one who always bought her things, never asking her for anything in return.\u201cNow that she\u2019s loaded, instead of helping us, she wants you to return the money, despite knowing that you\u2019re in such a tight situation. She even humiliated you! She went overboard this time!\u201dQin Yi kept quiet but the look in his eyes had slowly darkened.\u201cIf I had known that this was how it would be, I would have gone to the Zhan family instead. Since I\u2019ve been sick all my life and I don\u2019t know how much time I have left\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? Isn\u2019t it just a congenital heart problem? Medical technology has advanced so much these days. You just need to take good care of yourself and you\u2019ll be able to live a long, healthy life. Plus, the Zhan family specifically asked for Qianqian. Don\u2019t blame yourself for it.\u201d\u201cI just don\u2019t want to see you sad. If you\u2019re sad, I\u2019ll feel even worse. Stop feeling sad about it, okay? If big sister continues to threaten you, I\u2019ll get mum to ask big sister for money and then pass it down to you.\u201dThen, Jing Lu wrapped her arms around Qin Yi\u2019s skinny waist. She was as soft and gentle as a rabbit.The last thing Jing Lu had said was the one to finally calm Qin Yi\u2019s racing heart.He stroked Jing Lu\u2019s silky hair as his dark face finally turned bright once again. Then, with a smile on his face, he said, \u201cThank you, Xiao Lu. You\u2019re the best.\u201d\u201cWhy are you thanking me? I\u2019m your actual girlfriend. Shouldn\u2019t I be helping you?\u201dQin Yi did not deny what Jing Lu said. Instead, he hugged her even tighter.\u201cXiao Lu, I\u2019m so sorry. Originally, I wanted to break things off with her but then the Zhan family came, and you had to remain in the dark. I couldn\u2019t even give you a proper status.\u201cBut, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re a couple now and I will never forget you, even if I become famous. We will walk side by side from now on. I will be the most famous actor and you will be the most famous actress.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201dJing Lu gently nodded her head.Most famous actress. That was her goal since entering the entertainment industry.******Jing Qian had only returned to her room for less than two minutes when Butler Xu, who was still in his neat suit, knocked and opened her door.\u201cYoung Mistress, I have brought the things that you asked for.\u201dButler Xu shifted slightly and revealed the servants behind him, all of whom were holding onto cages that were filled with big, fat rats.Jing Qian looked at them and smiled instantly.\u201cThank you, Butler Xu. Just place them on the floor.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Young Mistress.\u201d Butler Xu bowed slightly.

Then, she went back to the table and started working on the things that she had harvested from the garden.After a while, she looked through her silk nightgown and took out a bottle that was filled with water. Then, she poured everything into the small bottle and added a few droplets of the perfume that she liked into it.About an hour later, there were 15 bottles on the table, all of which had a wonderful yet unique fragrance. Jing Qian happily shook the fluid that was in the bottle, placing one of them inside her bag. Then, she took the remaining ones and placed them back into the cupboard.After taking a shower, it was already one in the morning by the time Jing Qian went to bed.However, she didn\u2019t go to sleep right away. Instead, she sat cross-legged with both hands on her thigh, closing her eyes and keeping her back straight.This was a habit that she had kept for several years, always meditating for two hours before going to bed.When Jing Qian tried using the familiar method to circulate her inner Qi, however, she was forced to suddenly open her eyes.Sh*t! There was no Qi! She did not have any inner Qi!!!Jing Qian was devastated.Still, even though she no longer had any inner Qi, most of the skills she had remained with her even after the rebirth. Plus, she no longer suffered from depression. As she thought about this, she immediately felt much better.Well, she could still start all over again.As she convinced herself that her situation wasn\u2019t too bad, she closed her eyes once again and tried to guide Qi from the environment into her body.Just as she was about to introduce it into her body, she felt that there was a layer blocking it from the inside of her body.Even her meridians were not connected!If the meridians weren\u2019t connected, it was a waste of time to meditate.She gave up and immediately fell asleep after lying down for less than a minute.After a while, the person who was fast asleep on the bed suddenly opened her eyes.Those seductive, blossom eyes now had a vigorous look in them.She flipped around and looked at the control board next to her bed.It was currently three thirty in the morning and the temperature was 24\u00b0.Before going to bed, she clearly remembered that the indoor temperature had been 26\u00b0.An enchanting smile appeared across her beautiful face as she realized what was going on.Although she knew that under these conditions, the other person would temporarily be unconscious, she still decided to take a bottle out of the cupboard, open it, and place it by the connecting door, allowing it to slowly diffuse into the other room.Then, after a while, she opened the connecting doors between their rooms.There were video cameras inside Zhan Lichuan\u2019s room but there were technically useless.She didn\u2019t even need a laptop. She took out her phone, swiped across it and the image where she was supposed to be was no longer there on the screen.She walked towards Zhan Lichuan\u2019s bed and looked at him. Even though he was now a quadriplegic, he still looked very attractive, his appearance one of the best that she had ever seen. At this moment, Zhan Lichuan was unconscious, droplets of sweat forming on his forehead.The discomfort in his body was still affecting him, even when he wasn\u2019t conscious.Jing Qian walked towards the door where the bedroom and the balcony intersected, shutting it close before returning back to Zhan Lichuan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, the men who admired her and had hovered around her before this all had really hot bodies.So for her, being surrounded by good-looking bodies was a very common situation. After being surrounded by that for a long time, it was really hard for anyone to make her covetous.However, when Zhan Lichuan was half-naked in front of her in the dim moonlight, Jing Qian became stunned and the muscles around her neck trembled.Tsktsk!Although he had been paralyzed for three months, every part of his body was curated to perfection and looked extremely intricate.From the chest to the abs to the looming mermaid line seen near his groin, each and every part was outlined to form a perfect picture.Along with his deep facial features\u2026 \u2026She must save this man!He was such a perfect man. She would regret it if she didn\u2019t save this man. Her conscience would also be deeply condemned.One should always stay true to their conscience.No matter how many people scolded or blamed her, she had always been upright, living her life according to her original intentions.Perhaps this was all god\u2019s intention that she was reborn into Jing Qian\u2019s body.But because she just got reborn, she had no inner Qi now, so the only thing she could do for Zhan Lichuan was a simple massage.She placed both her thumbs on two particular acupuncture points and pressed down on them heavily\u2026Zhan Lichuan, who had been pretending to be unconscious, almost screamed from the pain.Suddenly, he felt a gush of warm blood rushing towards his brain.Even without looking at the mirror, he knew that his face was completely red at the moment.Just when he thought that this woman was going to break his head apart and he was just about to awaken the Zhan\u2019s family security system, the hands on his neck slowly relaxed. The blood that had gushed into his head flowed down through his neck and back into the rest of his body.As the blood flowed past his shoulder, he could no longer feel anything, with no idea what Jing Qian was doing to him after that.The only thing he could feel was the sudden gush of blood into his head, sometimes causing him to feel hypoxic.He knew that there was something wrong with his room, as an ethereal smell would appear every once in a while.This smell would easily make others unconscious, but it didn\u2019t work on him.That was why he had been trying to find out who was trying to poison him.However, no matter how many high-tech micro cameras he placed around his room, he still couldn\u2019t find the culprit behind this.Just like before, he had noticed the smell, but as he looked around the room, there was no one suspicious around him.This meant that the ethereal smell had appeared out of nowhere.While he was puzzling over the situation, the connecting doors opened and this hypocritical person appeared in his room.Amongst the Zhan family, he had suspected every one of them other than his grandfather and this woman. He had never expected that the person who had been entering his room would turn out to be someone he had completely ignored.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He kept his eyes closed and allowed her to do whatever she wanted. He wanted to see what she would do to hasten his death.Since his request for euthanasia had been rejected by his grandfather, as long as he could find the culprit behind the accident and the cause of his death, he would be ready to rest in peace.He initially thought that the other person was planning to further destroy his body. However, as she closed the door and the ventilation system inside the room got rid of the ethereal smell in the room, the nauseous feeling along with his shortness of breath slowly disappeared.Then, Zhan Lichuan\u2019s heart shuddered.This woman\u2026\u2026She was trying to help him?Although his eyes were closed, multiple questions were running through Zhan Lichuan\u2019s mind.If she came in with a bad intention, she would have been working for someone else before this. She must have found a way to convince grandfather to allow her into the Zhan family and then married him.This meant that everything that he knew about her was a facade and none of these would be surprising.However, this woman was actually helping him.This proved that his grandfather had randomly found some woman who matched his Ba-zi, someone who seemed sweet and silly but actually had skills.If she was this good, why did she marry a quadriplegic like him?Zhan Lichuan continued the charade of being \u201cunconscious,\u201d but the curiosity that he had for the woman had already exceeded the curiosity for the culprit.Because she no longer had her inner Qi, she was not able to accurately perceive how severe the damage to the nerves was.However, after the massage, she felt that it wasn\u2019t the kind that was incurable.If she wanted to save him, she would first have to recover her inner Qi. As for now, the only thing she could do was a simple massage, along with acupuncture.Zhan Lichuan\u2019s fair skin slowly turned red and the pores on his skin slowly got bigger due to the massage. With every part that Jing Qian massaged, small droplets of sweat appeared on the skin.After massaging the acupuncture points in the front, Jing Qian easily flipped Zhan Lichuan around.Then, she continued massaging the acupuncture points on his back, lifting his head once in a whileAbout 20 minutes later, Jing Qian decided to turn him back to his original position.She tied her hair up and then bent forward. Placing one of his arms across her shoulder, she placed his other arm behind his back.Then she moved backward, and just as he was about to flip over, Jing Qian immediately pulled on the arm that was placed behind his back.Because one of her arms was placed behind him to protect his back and her other hand had to pull on the arm that was placed behind his back, their faces were very close to each other, the position extremely seductive.Zhan Lichuan could even feel Jing Qian\u2019s sweet breath on his face.This woman\u2026Why did her breath smell so sweet?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, she grabbed his clothes while reaching for his other arm and properly dressed him.After that, she buttoned his clothes, pulled the blanket up, and adjusted the temperature to 26\u00b0 before returning to her own room.As soon as the door closed, Zhan Lichuan slowly opened his eyes.Following the commands from his brain, the tablet that was diagonally placed above him lit up.The time was adjusted to the moment she had walked in. However, the screen only showed him lying on the bed sleeping, no one else present inside the room.The time on the screen continued moving and she was in the room for about 40 minutes while she massaged him. However, on the screen in front of him, there were no signs of her entering his room.So\u2026Not only did this woman know medicine, she was also a hacker?\u201cAchoo!\u201dJing Qian sneezed loudly when she was walking back to her bed after washing her hands. She had no idea that she had already exposed herself on the first day of her rebirth.As for the person in the room that was next to her, Zhan Lichuan was giving orders to his computers with his brain. Soon, there were codes appearing on the screen, the command that Jing Qian had hacked into quickly decoded.After decoding it, Jing Qian\u2019s figure appeared on another screen.Zhan Lichuan stared at the woman on the screen for a really long time, his dark eyes glistening in the dim nightlight.This woman had the audacity to walk into his room dressed in a short, lace nightgown which barely covered her bottom?Did she really think that he was completely useless, allowing her to walk around dressed like that?After that, he saw the woman staring in the direction of a video camera on the opposite side. Her fingers swiftly moved across the screen of her phone and within a minute, she had hacked into her camera.Although there were no strict firewalls placed in the cameras, as the one who had installed them, Zhan Lichuan had ensured that the firewalls placed were no less than those placed in important governmental departments.However, this woman hacked into them within less than a minute.That showed that she was an expert and with how she had done it\u2026 She must be extremely experienced.After getting rid of his camera, the woman walked to his bedside and pressed the control board to increase the temperature within his room.Then, she placed her hand on his wrist as she was checking his condition which was then followed by a massage. But\u2026What kind of expression was she wearing when she unbuttoned his clothes?Zhan Lichuan\u2019s face, which was usually cold and had a dark look in his eyes, was now filled with a disgusted expression.He paid attention to the acupuncture points that Jing Qian was pressing onto and searched for them online. He ordered his men to search for each and every one of them, wanting to know what these points were for.His men had not received commands from Zhan Lichuan for quite some time, so when they got their instructions, every one of them had an adrenaline rush and quickly went to work.Soon, Zhan Lichuan got all of their replies.The acupuncture points that were on his back were used to excite the nerves in his spine, aiding circulation. They also helped to provide better sleep and relieve any stress on the overworked muscles. As for the points on his chest and neck, they were to help with his pneumonia and helped to get rid of any chronic lung diseases.Zhan Lichuan\u2019s eyes deepened once again.Ever since he was paralyzed, he had already gotten pneumonia four times in the past three months. However, he hadn\u2019t had an episode of the disease in the past three weeks, ever since Jing Qian came into the Zhan family.So\u2026How did she know about his lung condition?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No one would dare to look down on her and there would be a lot of powerful people who would want her. Such a woman shouldn\u2019t be a person who was short on money.Plus, she definitely wouldn\u2019t be a person who would be dumb enough to marry a quadriplegic because of her family and boyfriend.He didn\u2019t even think that it was because this woman had liked him and was trying to help him, especially since she had been dating another man for the past 2 years.That was her first love.Then\u2026It must be that there is something that Jing Qian needed from him, which is why she decided to help, right?Other than this, Zhan Lichuan couldn\u2019t think of any other possibilities.In fact, this was great.He was curious as to whether her medical skills were as surprising as her hacking skills.If it was and he could help her out, why not do so?However, the woman\u2019s breath on his face and the faint, sweet scent that was different from the others kept Zhan Lichuan awake all night.******\u201cKnock, knock, knock!\u201dIn a deep sleep, she could faintly hear the sound of someone knocking on her door.However, Jing Qian frowned and irritably covered her head with a blanket.About ten seconds later, the knocking sound continued, still able to be heard even while under the blanket.Jing Qian continued ignoring it and stayed hidden.\u201cKnock, knock, knock!\u201dThe knocking sound on the door sounded without any hesitation for the third time.\u201cYoung mistress.\u201dThis time, along with the knocking sound, there were people calling for her as well.\u201cSh*t the f**k up! Is someone dead or what?!\u201dJing Qian\u2019s face was dark as she pulled down the blanket and reached for the clock that was placed by the bedside. It was as big as her palm and made of a rare, golden material. She picked it up and threw it against the door.Butler Xu, who was standing right outside, heard her loud cry.The people around the door were all shocked by it. When they went closer to the door and were about to say something else, they heard two loud bangs.The first one was the sound of the door almost breaking, and the second was the sound of a heavy object being dropped onto the floor.The sudden violence caused Butler Xu to shudder in fear and immediately stand in a position that made it seem as if he was ready to fight.Master Zhan, who was standing by the side, was shocked.\u201cEhm, Master Zhan\u2026 It looks like the Young Mistress may be having some trouble getting out of bed,\u201d Butler Xu said with an awkward expression.The poor man was already an elder in his fifties and could no longer withstand fright. When he was a few years younger, he was a strong, courageous man, incapable of being frightened.When Master Zhan saw the frightened look on Butler Xu\u2019s face, he instructed him, \u201cWhen she gets out of bed, bring her to the study so that she can explain herself.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir.\u201dJust as Master Zhan was about to leave, the door in front of them opened.Jing Qian, who was dressed in a white bathrobe, stood in front of them like an innocent kitten who just woken up.\u201cGrandfather, morning! Butler Xu, morning!\u201d Jing Qian cheerfully greeted her \u201cboss\u201d and Butler Xu, who was authoritative, with a bright, vigorous smile.Butler Xu and Master Zhan, who smiled slightly, were both rendered speechless.Her reaction was very different from the one from before, making it extremely difficult for Master Zhan to start the topic that he had planned to discuss.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

My dad had already sneaked into the enemy\u2019s territory along with the police and had told my sister to keep quiet.\u201cHowever, she decided to scream for help, and in order to save her, my dad was severely injured due to one of the kidnappers. I was very angry, which is why I screamed at her. I picked up a brick that was beside me and threw it towards the kidnapper.\u201cThen, I heard a loud noise, which woke me up. That was when I realized that I must have been sleepwalking and really threw something at the door. By the time I came back to my senses, I heard Butler Xu calling for me. Grandfather, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201dWith that, Jing Qian looked at her \u201cboss\u201d with guilt.Ayyyy\u2026In her previous life, she was born to reign. She had the habit of challenging others who looked down on her. From her birth till her death, she wasn\u2019t afraid of anything or anyone. Even if it was her \u201cboss,\u201d she would still keep her head held high.But for now\u2026She had no money, no status, and no skills.The only place where she could challenge someone would probably be the morgue, to see if anyone dared to breath with her around.As she thought about her depressing life, Jing Qian looked at Master Zhan with an even more sincere look.Just now, she was still drossy and had forgotten who she was now. There was a moment where she thought she was still sleeping in her villa and one of the servants were brave enough to wake her up, but the loud noise had woken her up and she immediately opened the door.When Butler Xu saw her explaining with a sincere look, he decided to still believe what she said.For a woman like her, who was willing to sacrifice for her family, it showed that she cared a lot about them.So\u2026 Young Mistress should be telling the truth, right?But\u2026 Why did he feel like he was being played again?Hmm?Why did he think \u201cagain\u201d?While Butler Xu was trying to remember when he had been played before this, Master Zhan had already moved onto the main topic.\u201cQianqian, I heard from Butler Xu that you asked for rats yesterday?\u201dFrom Master Zhan\u2019s point of view, he didn\u2019t care much about Jing Qian\u2019s personality, character, talent, education, or whether she sleepwalked. The only thing that was important to him was that she wouldn\u2019t harm his grandson.\u201cYup, that\u2019s right,\u201d Jing Qian replied with an obedient smile.When Master Zhan saw her being so compliant, his heart slowly calmed down, continuing to ask, \u201cWhy did you ask for all these rats? Where did you put them?\u201d\u201cI placed them at the balcony and the greenhouse near the third young master\u2019s room.\u201dSince Jing Qian was still answering him with an upright smile, Master Zhan did feel unhappy about those words, still willing to give her a chance to explain herself.\u201cThere must be a reason why you did it, right?\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d Jing Qian nodded her head and moved to one side. \u201cGrandfather, please come in. I\u2019ll bring you there to see the rats.\u201dMaster Zhan had no idea what she was doing, but since this matter involved Ah Chuan, no matter what it was, he wanted answers to it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her mood immediately turned bad.This was because when she had depression in her previous life, she could never get a good night\u2019s sleep and would only fall asleep in the morning. Even if she had a mission to do that day, she would never accept anything that was before 11 AM.However, she was now living under someone else\u2019s roof\u2026\u2026At this moment, Jing Qian was determined to make herself rich again.As she sighed to herself, Master Zhan noticed this and thought that it had something to do with Ah Chuan. He couldn\u2019t help but frown.First, Jing Qian brought Master Zhan and Butler Xu to the spot where she placed the rats.What they saw were four rats who were no longer moving actively like the night before. All of them looked dead, and there were even vomitus inside the cage. Although none of them were really dead, they looked really sick.\u201cButler Xu, when I asked for the rats, I remember saying that I wanted those that were fat and healthy, right?\u201dButler Xu had no idea how many rats there were in total, but just by looking at the ones in front of him, he knew that something was wrong and quickly answered, \u201cYes, Young Mistress, you did. I did exactly as you told and got them to catch those that looked fat and strong. What happened to these rats?\u201d\u201cJING QIAN!\u201dJust as Jing Qian was about to speak, Jiang Yuxi, who was on the other side of the balcony, saw them walking out. She screamed furiously and started marching towards them.\u201cI heard that you asked Butler Xu for rats yesterday? Why did you put these dead rats in front of Brother Chuan\u2019s room? Don\u2019t you know that this is an unlucky thing to do?!\u201dJiang Yuxi rushed over, and without asking what happened, she started screaming at Jing Qian. Since grandfather was here, she wanted him to see for himself that she was more suitable to be with Brother Chuan instead of Jing Qian.Jing Qian frowned and moved two steps back. With a disgusted look on her face, she couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cWatch your manners, lady. Your saliva is getting all over my face.\u201dJiang Yuxi flushed, feeling angry and awkward at the same time.\u201cJing Qian, don\u2019t you dare change the topic. Now that grandfather is here, you better explain yourself. Why did you place dead rats in Brother Chuan\u2019s sun room?\u201dJing Qian glanced at her and said, \u201cExplain myself to you? Why should I?\u201dThen, without waiting for Jiang Yuxi to say another word, she turned around and spoke to Master Zhan. \u201cGrandfather, let\u2019s go to the sun room.\u201dJiang Yuxi, who was completely ignored, burned with rage. Then, as Jing Qian passed by her, she didn\u2019t even bother to slow down but directly knocked her over.She was caught off guard by this and was pushed aside, which \u2018cleared\u2019 Jing Qian\u2019s path.Although Jing Qian only wore her nightgown, the way she twisted her hips, along with the intimidating, dazzling stride made her look like a queen.This b*tch\u2026This terrace was huge. Why didn\u2019t she choose another path instead?! She had to purposely push her away!This was too much!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Once the door between them opened, both areas would be connected.There were two cages of rats inside, but all of them were dead. Having already anticipated this, Jing Qian didn\u2019t look the least bit surprised when she saw them.\u201cYoung Mistress, why are these rats dead?\u201dAlthough he\u2019d already seen them before, Butler Xu was still disgusted when he beheld the rats, which seemed to have died struggling.Jiang Yuxi chose then to walk into the room. When Jing Qian subconsciously looked at her, the former instantly exploded.\u201cWhy are you looking at me? Are you going to say that I\u2019m the one who killed the rats here? Jing Qian, there should be a limit even if you\u2019re trying to frame me!\u201dFeeling wronged, Jiang Yuxi said to Master Zhan, \u201cGrandfather, I came to the Zhan family when I was 17. For the past five years, you\u2019ve seen for yourself how I\u2019ve been treating Brother Chuan. I only want the best for him. Why would I place these dead rats here to harm him?\u201dThen, she turned to Jing Qiang and screamed, \u201cJing Qian, don\u2019t you know that these rats are dirty creatures that can spread disease? Ever since the accident, Brother Chuan\u2019s immune system has been weak, yet you placed these rats right outside his room! Even if you didn\u2019t kill them, shouldn\u2019t you at least give us an explanation as to why you placed these dirty critters outside of Brother Chuan\u2019s room?\u201dMaster Zhan, noticing that Jing Qian was extremely calm, realized what was happening. He was immediately filled with rage as he asked, \u201cIs there something wrong with Ah Chuan\u2019s room?\u201dJing Qian gently nodded her head and said in a caring tone, \u201cGrandfather, you\u2019re quite clever, unlike some people here whose brains are far away from here, just like their room. Indeed, there is something wrong with third young master\u2019s sunroom.\u201dJiang Yuxi almost passed out after being triggered by Jing Qian\u2019s evil mouth.She had moved out of her room and shifted to the guest house last night. Although it was an individual suite and the view was just as breath-taking, it was still different from this mansion!This b*tch was doing it on purpose!However, when she heard that there was something wrong with the sunroom and this woman may have found what it was with the help of these rats, she swallowed the words she was about to spit out.When Master Zhan heard about the problem in the sunroom, which was connected to Zhan Lichuan\u2019s bedroom, he immediately ran towards his grandson\u2019s room, horrified.Jiang Yuxi found her opportunity and rushed into the room as well.\u201cAh Chuan!\u201d Master Zhan cried nervously as he rushed into the room.When Zheyan and Yunzhou, who were guarding outside, heard noises inside the room, they quickly opened the door and saw a whole bunch of people crowding the room.\u201cGrandfather.\u201dAlthough Zhan Lichuan wasn\u2019t sleeping, his eyes were still closed shut. He opened his eyes upon hearing the noise and immediately looked at the figure who followed behind his anxious grandfather. Jing Qian looked worried and docile, but in actuality, she was just walking inside leisurely.Zhan Lichuan was just casually observing Jing Qian; the other party shouldn\u2019t have noticed. However, Jing Qian immediately realized it and turned in his direction.Jing Qian\u2019s reflex may be fast, but Zhan Lichuan\u2019s was faster.When her focus shifted to him, Zhan Lichuan\u2019s eyes had already quickly moved towards Jiang Yuxi instead, who was standing in front of her.Perhaps it was because he had done it on purpose and his eyes were firm, for it caused things to be more obvious\u2014Jiang Yuxi could instantly feel someone watching her.When Zhan Lichuan\u2019s eyes landed on her, Jiang Yuxi felt as if her entire world was filled with rainbows.Brother Chuan was finally looking at her!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She only hoped that Brother Chuan would pay a little more attention to her. She believed that with all the hard work and effort she had put in for the past few years, Brother Chuan would definitely appreciate her as long as he noticed her. When he realised her good virtues, it would be like an interesting book. He would want to know more about her. She firmly believed that Brother Chuan would realize that she was the best choice and the most suitable for him. Since even when he became a quadriplegic, she was still there for him no matter what.Then, he would choose her.In her eyes, she believed that Brother Chuan was the best even if he was to remain paralyzed for the rest of his life. He was even better than Zhan Yuheng.This was true as long as he wanted it.\u201cAh Chuan, are you okay?\u201dWhen Master Zhan saw that Zhan Lichuan\u2019s condition was better than yesterday\u2019s, he let out a sigh of relief.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Zhan Lichuan\u2019s voice was still very calm; however, when compared to the tone he used yesterday while pleading for euthanasia, the one today seemed a little bit more cheerful.Master Zhan had no idea what was happening. He quickly turned to Jing Qian and asked, \u201cQianqian, what\u2019s happening? Why did the rats outside die? Would Ah Chuan be affected?\u201dWhile being questioned by Master Zhan, Jing Qian looked at the orchids that were planted in Zhan Lichuan\u2019s sunroom. Then, she asked, \u201cThird Young Master, do you like orchids?\u201dMaster Zhan was clear about his grandson\u2019s personality\u2014he wouldn\u2019t answer Jing Qian even if he weren\u2019t paralyzed. Now that he was, it would be worse. For this reason, Master Zhan was prepared to answer her question on his behalf.However, before Master Zhan could say a word, Jiang Yuxi had already opened her big mouth.\u201cOrchids are Brother Chuan\u2019s favourite. Can\u2019t you see that there are so many expensive orchids placed in the sunroom?\u201dOh my lord, this temper of hers!Jing Qian was completely speechless.\u201cMiss Jiang, were you born extremely thick-skinned or do you have amnesia? Grandfather already warned you to stay away from the third young master to avoid any misunderstandings, yet here you are. Why are you in our bedroom? I was asking third young master a question. As an outsider, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re a bit too much of a busybody?\u201dJiang Yuxi, having still been immersed in the overwhelming joy from before, had not planned to argue with Jing Qian. However, when the other party suddenly insulted her, she looked at Jing Qian as if she had been unreasonably bitten by a stray dog.Then, Master Zhan spoke. \u201cYuxi, you shouldn\u2019t be in here. Why don\u2019t you wait outside?\u201dMaster Zhan knew what Jiang Yuxi\u2019s thoughts were, but Jing Qian was someone whom he had brought into the family to bring luck to Ah Chuan\u2019s life. Although he had raised Jiang Yuxi for several years and had feelings for her, this matter involved Ah Chuan. Nothing else was as important as this.Jiang Yuxi flushed and bit her lips. She replied in a pitiful voice, \u201cGrandfather, I\u2019m worried about Brother Chuan. I just want to know why Jing Qian placed those dead rats outside of his room.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need you to worry about me. Get out.\u201dNo one had expected the person lying on the sick bed to open his mouth; even Jing Qian was surprised.

However, when hearing Zhan Lichuan\u2019s cold words, the colour in her face drained away and turned pale.She was still in cloud nine a minute ago when Brother Chuan looked at her, but the next minute, she got a huge slap across her face. The contrast was so drastic that Jiang Yuxi\u2019s mind went blank and her ears started ringing.\u201cMiss Jiang, our young master is asking you to leave.\u201d Yunzhou emotionlessly walked towards Jiang Yuxi, his voice robotic.When Master Zhan saw Jiang Yuxi\u2019s weeping, he still felt guilty for this poor child. Just as he was about to speak up to comfort her, Jing Qian, who was next to them, chuckled sarcastically.\u201cOh no, this came so abruptly for you, didn\u2019t it? Looks like your Brother Chuan doesn\u2019t care much for all your love and care after all.\u201dZhan Lichuan\u2019s gaze turned meaningful as he looked at the woman who was humiliating the other party, unafraid of making another scene.As for Jiang Yuxi, she might be unhappy with Jing Qian, but she had never hated Jing Qian this much.This b*tch was horrible and disgusting.She didn\u2019t know when to stop and didn\u2019t have the basic courtesy to keep a line between them for amiable meetings in the future. Even with grandfather and Brother Chuan here, she was still trying to stir up trouble. Absolutely unbelievable!Although she was already burning with rage, Jiang Yuxi took two deep breaths and smiled.\u201cI understand that Brother Chuan may be in a bad mood, so I can tolerate it. You don\u2019t have to try triggering me further by saying horrible things.\u201dWith that, Jiang Yuxi showed a caring smile on her face and said, \u201cBrother Chuan, I\u2019m leaving now. Have a good rest. I\u2019ll come by again soon.\u201d\u201cInfinite tolerance is only found between a mother and son. So, you\u2019ve been treating the third young master as your son? Wow\u2026 what great motherly love.\u201dJiang Yuxi was already by the door when Jing Qian\u2019s voice rang behind her. She got so angry that she almost exploded on the spot.However, she still managed to calm herself down.She didn\u2019t want Brother Chuan to see her ill-mannered fighting with Jing Qian.Jing Qian may not love him, but she sure did. She didn\u2019t want the man she loved to think that she was someone as petty as Jing Qian.Once Jiang Yuxi left, Master Zhan said, \u201cQianqian, you were asking about the orchids just now. Are they related to the death of the rats?\u201dSince the horrible person had already left, Jing Qian no longer had any reason to continue being a b*tch. Therefore, she directly answered his question \u2014\u201cGhostorchids are among the most priceless orchids in the world. They\u2019re like priceless jewels for a collector, but there are dozens of them inside the third young master\u2019s room. Do they all belong to him, or were they a gift?\u201d\u201cOnly two of them were his. As for the rest, his sister and I are the ones who placed them there. There are a total of 13 Ghostorchids now. Is there something wrong with them?\u201dJing Qian shook her head. \u201cIf you only plant Ghostorchids by themselves, it won\u2019t be a problem, but it would be if you placed them with Osmanthus and Henbit.\u201d\u201cHenbit? What\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cThe green plants by the wall that are used to beautify these flowers.\u201dMaster Zhan didn\u2019t know what it was, so Jing Qian went to the sunroom, plucked out one of the Henbits that were next to the orchids, and brought it back into the room for Master Zhan to see.As he looked at it, his face turned dark.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was all because of phosgene.\u201cPhosgene? What\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a highly toxic gas that is ten times more toxic than chloride gas. Phosgene poisoning can cause rapid damage to the respiratory system, and once severe, it can cause damage to the other systems as well. Most who are poisoned will feel breathless, cough, and get dizzy at first; then that would be followed by pneumonia. There may be some severe cases that could lead to pneumothorax. If too much poison gas were to be inhaled, it could directly lead to multiorgan failure.\u201dThe entire room was pindrop silent as she spoke.Master Zhan\u2019s face was so dark that black ink could be dripping down his chin. He thought about all those times where Ah Chuan had spontaneously contracted pneumonia. It wasn\u2019t because his immune system was bad but that he\u2019d been exposed to phosgene.All this while, this toxic gas had been circulating inside Ah Chuan\u2019s body, which was already severely damaged to begin with.\u201cQianqian, are you saying that Ah Chuan was poisoned? Then\u2026 would he be in danger now?\u201d Master Zhan swallowed painfully as he spoke, his voice sounding extremely bitter.Jing Qian immediately comforted him. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to know how long these three have been placed together, though luckily, the third young master\u2019s room has gotten a new ventilation system. Even if the toxic gases were once in here, most of them would be diffused by now. Other than that, there are many orchids and henbits here. Although the osmanthus tree is huge, it\u2019d still require a certain temperature to work. So\u2026\u201dEveryone listened to her seriously, especially Zhan Lichuan. The way he stared at her could have punctured a hole in her body. Jing Qian immediately realised that she might have said too much.She changed her tone and said, \u201cAhem\u2026. It may have harmed him, but it couldn\u2019t be too severe. Since the third young master\u2019s circulation had been tampered with after the accident, we would still need to do a more detailed checkup. I\u2019m not a doctor, so it would be better for grandfather to get someone here to check on the third young master.\u201dAs the woman before him blabbered about not being a doctor, a sharp look appeared in Zhan Lichuan\u2019s eyes.No longer able to stand the sight of this cunning fox playing around with his grandfather, he asked, \u201cYou said that when all these plants are together, it\u2019ll still require a certain temperature.\u201dEver since he was paralysed, Zhan Lichuan had lacked interest in everything around him. When he suddenly started talking, Master Zhan, who was sitting next to him, got so excited that he almost stood up.\u201cEn.\u201d Jing Qian nodded.Just as she was about to continue, Zhan Lichuan spoke again. \u201c20 degrees?\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware that the third young master\u2019s knowledge of chemistry was so extensive.\u201dAs Zhan Lichuan looked at the enchanting smile on Jing Qian\u2019s face, a desire to conquer started growing inside him.Well, of course, he was about to die and he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it physically, so this desire to conquer had turned into a desire to win instead.The type of desire where he wanted to tear this fox apart to see what she was made of.\u201cWhen I was in college, I chose business administration, but I also studied physics and chemistry, which was of the same level.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No wonder you became the most brilliant helm of the business world!\u201d Jing Qian was being thick-skinned as she continued kissing her boss\u2019s ass.When he saw her sweet smile, Zhan Lichuan thought of her sweet scent that landed on his face last night.Zhan Lichuan\u2019s face was suddenly replaced by a warm, gentle smile. \u201cCompared to my wife, I\u2019m a nobody.\u201dHuh?Wife?What did that mean?Jing Qian\u2019s mouth couldn\u2019t help but twitch at the sound of that word.When she was done thinking about the word \u2018wife\u2019, she immediately realized that he had called himself a nobody when compared to her.Did that mean, to him, she was better than him?Damn it, this man!Was he trying to say that she\u2019d been hiding her skills?F**k!Her head began spinning because of this one sentence of his.Did he always speak so\u2026.tactfully?Wouldn\u2019t his intestines get tangled from it?Jing Qian chuckled to herself as she replied, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. Why would I know anything about chemistry? It\u2019s just a coincidence that I have the same hobby as you, young master. I get curious about the plants I like and search them up on the internet.\u201dOn the internet again?Butler Xu, who was observing everyone in the room, glanced at Jing Qian. He couldn\u2019t help but feel that she was fooling them.Other than Butler Xu and Jing Qian, Master Zhan was equally shocked as well.He was possibly, or most definitely, the most surprised among all three of them.What did Ah Chuan refer to Jing Qian as?Did Ah Chuan finally admit that Jing Qian was his wife?Was he hallucinating?One should know that when he first insisted on Ah Chuan marrying her, Ah Chuan had been against it.Although he didn\u2019t say anything to him, he was Ah Chuan\u2019s grandfather, so he knew clearly that his grandson was against this marriage from the bottom of his heart.However, he now called Jing Qian his \u2018wife\u2019 and even conversed with her.Master Zhan tried to stop himself from smiling but\u2026 He couldn\u2019t!\u201cYou can find anything online. It\u2019s just that most people wouldn\u2019t use the internet to verify the information and apply it in real life. Young Mistress seems to be of those who are observant and could apply in their daily lives.\u201d Zhan Lichuan spoke again and praised Jing Qian.She turned around and stared at Zhan Lichuan, still thinking whether the things that he had said were compliments or insults\u2026In the end, Jing Qian silently decided that she would have to be more cautious in the future since her rebirth was a secret. She shouldn\u2019t let this smartass find out about it.\u201cHehe.\u201d Jing Qian had a bitter smile on her face and said, \u201cI\u2019m honoured that these little things that I\u2019ve learnt were able to help out third young master.\u201dAs both of them continued talking, Master Zhan\u2019s eyes, which were originally small and sharp, now widened immensely. His heart was overflowing with joy, and he had even forgotten the fact that someone was trying to harm his grandson.This was because when Ah Chuan pleaded for euthanasia the day before, he\u2019d seen the despair in his eyes.However, today, he finally saw hope and interest in Ah Chuan\u2019s eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In other words, other than planting these Henbits, the culprit also had to lower the temperature in my room.\u201dJing Qian nodded her head. \u201cSince our rooms are connected, the temperature in my room was 24 degrees.

I was just trying to help.\u201dIn the end, Master Zhan repeatedly thanked Jing Qian for it, and because he was worried about Zhan Lichuan, he told Butler Xu to send him to the hospital for a thorough check-up.As for how Master Zhan intended to investigate this matter, it was none of her business.When Zhan Lichuan left, it was only seven-thirty in the morning and Jing Qian decided to make a trip to Qin Yi\u2019s house.As she decided this, Jing Qian felt her heart ache and her head throb as well.Ever since her rebirth, she still sensed lingering consciousness that the previous owner had left in her body, which was why every time she thought of Qin Yi, her body would hurt all over. However, if she trusted Qin Yi, why was she so afraid of going to his house early in the morning?You\u2019re already dead, but you left behind such a strong obsession for him.**eye rollTherefore, in order to get rid of this last hope that the previous owner had, she knew that she had to make this trip to his house. She must awaken the secretly hidden obsession.No, that\u2019s not right. She was going to demolish this subconscious obsession.******62.2\u00b0 north latitude, 152.9\u00b0 west longitude; on a private island, the number of boats and helicopters around increased.As time passed, the people gathered around the island got more and more complicated.Other than the Tang sect, there were also other groups of people from all over the world who were helping to locate Saka. There were people from the government, partners, and even gangsters. They would either be there personally or send over their men.However, as time went by, the odds of Saka\u2019s survival became smaller.Dong Yuetong had already fainted thrice from crying. Every time she woke up, she would run to the beach where she would be welcomed by the bone chilling sea breeze. She would ignore everyone\u2019s advice and continue standing there waiting for her sister to come back.Her thin body stood in the wind as if she would be blown away by the wind and washed away by the waves.\u201cXiao Yue, let\u2019s head back to the campsite first. It\u2019s windy here.\u201dThis man had been next to her the entire time. He was tall and handsome; with his handmade haute couture suit, his slender figure was perfectly set off.There was grievance written all over his face, but when he saw Dong Yuetong\u2019s swollen red eyes, he looked heartbroken as well.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to wait at the camp. I want to wait for her here. Brother Jinyuan, big sister has been capable all her life. She\u2019s still alive, right?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everyone around them that was looking at them sighed.Xue Jinyuan was Saka\u2019s fiance and the young master of the Xue family. His background was one of the best, but Saka, as the master of the Tang Sect, was already rich and powerful. She never lacked money or resources. Saka had beauty and brains, and lots of admirers went after her. For the past few years, she hadn\u2019t shown many feelings for Xue Jinyuan.When others saw Xue Jinyuan and Dong Yuetong standing next to each other, they looked more like a couple instead.Since Saka was already dead now, it meant that the future development of the Tang Sect would be affected as well. If Miss Dong really ended up with Young Master Xu, both their families would be able to cooperate and it would be a win-win situation.Therefore, although Xue Jinyuan was Saka\u2019s fiance, the elders of the Tang Sect were quite happy when they saw Dong Yuetong and Xue Jinyuan together.Suddenly, a deafening sound came from above. From afar, dozens of helicopters that were arranged in a line flew towards them. The number of helicopters were a few times more than those sent by the Tang Sect and everyone else there combined.\u201cBrother Jinyuan, who\u2019s that?\u201dDong Yuetong, who was still grieving a moment ago, now looked at the scene with shock and envy.She couldn\u2019t believe that there was someone who would do so much for her even when she was already dead!Within the blink of an eye, the leading helicopter stopped at the helipad near the beach while the others directly joined those who were still searching by the ocean.Seeing this, Dong Yuetong quickly ran over to see who it was.Xue Jinyuan, who\u2019d been standing next to her, followed as well as his eyes filled with rage.And when he saw the man who walked out of the helicopter, the rage and jealousy in his eyes became even more obvious.The man wore a fitted silver mask that only showed his lips and chin. The rest of his face was hidden by the mask, but you could still see his cold, dark eyes that were sharp and chilling to the bone.He was at least 188 cm tall, and his slender figure was even more majestic under the warm moonlight.He wore an armour, and his entire look was ice cold. As he walked forward, it felt as if he could freeze the ground below his feet.Dong Yuetong\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief when she saw the man walking down the helicopter.As the man got closer to her, Dong Yuetong could feel her heart beating faster.\u201cYou\u2026. you\u2019re Z! You\u2019re Z from the Sanctuary!\u201dAlthough most of them had never seen Z personally, everyone around the world knew about the terrifying death knight, Z, from the Sanctuary.No one knew his real identity or background, but they knew that he built up his own force in the River Delta with his bare hands. His force was similar to AO2, which was an extremely wealthy group that specialized in selling high precision products to distribute all over the world.However, AO2 was known all around because they had high precision weapons and technology that could not be replicated. Most countries would try to maintain a good relationship with them. As for the Sanctuary, they managed to conquer the River Delta because of their overwhelming force.He had never shown his true self, and even if he were to appear, he would cover his face with a silver mask.As of now, about 30% of the international mercenaries were under his command.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, these mercenaries could cause chaos in their country with just five of them alone. They may even have to deploy their troops just to fight them.Although the Tang Sect had their own mercenaries, their quality and quantity were not of the same caliber as the Sanctuary\u2019s.He was the most powerful figure in the River Delta.On this day that Saka died, she finally got to meet Z!Dong Yuetong felt as if her heart was about to jump out of her chest.A minute ago, she had envied her sister, but now, all of it had turned into joy.If Saka and Z were good friends, the Tang Sect would be able to further expand with the help of the Sanctuary.The immense pressure made it even more difficult for Dong Yuetong to breathe. She was already panting, but she tried to put on her best smile while looking at Z. Along with her swollen red eyes, she looked so pitiful that anyone who saw her would want to protect her.By now, Z already stood in front of Dong Yuetong. Since she was only 165 cm, her height only reached his shoulder, which made her look even more helpless.Xue Jinyuan, who was standing next to her, reached out his hand, prepared to greet the other party. However, before anyone around them could so much as react, Z had already grabbed onto Dong Yuetong\u2019s neck at a terrifying speed.\u201cXiao Yue!\u201d Xue Jinyuan\u2019s eyes shuddered and he screamed. He tried to attack Z in the ribs to loosen the grasp he had on Dong Yuetong.However, before he could even touch the other person, Z had already kicked him in the chest and sent him flying.Xue Jinyuan was also someone who knew martial arts.Since he was Saka\u2019s fiance and the young master of the Xue family, he had been trained by experts that were hired by his family. Being able to sit firmly as the future heir of the Xu family and even managing to become Saka\u2019s fiance showed that he was an extremely talented man.When he was attacked by Z, he tried blocking with his arms. It may seem like he wasn\u2019t using much force, but in fact, he was already blocking with all his might.The person that he was facing was Z!He was someone who could command the international mercenaries.The moment he got kicked by Z, he realized that he had made a mistake.His efforts of perseverance for the past 20 years were like that of an ant trying to shake a big tree.Even if he used all of his strength, he was still easily kicked away by Z.When his butt touched the ground, Xue Jinyuan felt as if his brain and ego had both been smashed into pieces.\u201cYoung master!\u201dWhen the bodyguards of the Xue family saw this spectacle, they quickly took out their guns and pointed them at Z. Two of them simultaneously went forward to support their Young Master, who was on the ground.\u201cMove back!\u201d Xue Jinyuan screamed at his bodyguards even before he could stand up straight.However, it was obvious that his warning was not as fast as the men from the Sanctuary.Everyone around them, whether it be on land or sea, was already surrounded by the men from the Sanctuary.These men were either retired soldiers or hired mercenaries from all over the world. They had the stamina and physicality of an iron-blooded army. The Xue family\u2019s bodyguards simply could not contend with them.The most important thing was that the Sanctuary had firearms businesses and most of their weapons were heavy machinery. The Xue family\u2019s bodyguards, on the other hand, only held onto handguns.While facing such a power disparity, the Xue family\u2019s bodyguards were already trembling.\u201cPut your guns down!\u201d The veins on Xue Jinyuan\u2019s forehead were already pounding as he screamed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, the mercenaries who were close to the bodyguards even mocked them as they pointed their guns against the bodyguard\u2019s head while chewing on pieces of gum in their mouths.As for Z, he didn\u2019t even look at Xue Jinyuan. His hands were still gripping onto Dong Yuetong\u2019s neck, and the sharp look in his eyes was like daggers piercing through her body.\u201cYou\u2019re the one who killed Saka.Z finally spoke, but the words that he said shocked everyone around, their eyes widening.???What did they just hear?Dong Yuetong\u2019s eyes widened in fear as she stared at the man who was a head taller than her. At this moment, her entire body was trembling.As she faced the suspicious looks from the elders of the Tang Sect, Dong Yuetong panicked and immediately explained, \u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t\u2026 Why would I harm my own sister? She\u2026 she\u2019s my big sister!\u201d\u201cThe only person other than me who knew that she was coming to this island for a holiday was you. I wouldn\u2019t harm her, so the only one that would could only be you!\u201dDong Yuetong\u2019s heart sank.When did that b*tch become friends with Z?Z even knew about her private schedule.What was their relationship?\u201cNo\u2026 it wasn\u2019t me! You\u2019ve got to trust me! She was already suffering from chronic depression, and it was incurable. There were already a few times that she tried to kill herself, and I was the one who stopped her. One time, she already managed to harm herself, and if it weren\u2019t for me, she would have already died. If I were the one who killed her, why would I save her and try to stop her from harming herself?\u201cBig sister was always so nice to me. She even brought the Tang Sect to this level. If I\u2019m being frank, I would\u2019ve been able to earn a fortune had I stayed beside her. Without her, most of them wouldn\u2019t even care about the Tang Sect. She was so important to me, so why would I kill her?\u201dAs Z\u2019s grasp on her softened, it was easier and smoother for Dong Yuetong, and in the end, Z even let go of her.\u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you now, but not because I trust you, but that I don\u2019t have enough evidence yet. Seeing as you\u2019re her sister, I\u2019ll let you go for now. However, if I find out that you\u2019re the one who caused her death, I will make you regret being born in this world.\u201dDong Yuetong\u2019s face turned pale, and her lips wouldn\u2019t stop trembling: \u2026\u201cI\u2019ll be taking over. Now, take your men and leave!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 I\u2019m Saka\u2019s sister. I\u2019m her only family. I\u2026\u201d\u201cGet lost!\u201d Z didn\u2019t want to even listen to her explanation.Dong Yuetong had a pitiful look as she stared at Xue Jinyuan\u2019s face that was pale and twisted. She said in a sorrowful tone \u2014\u201cBrother Jinyuan!\u201dThis weak and helpless white lotus look that she had on was entirely different from the strong, independent image that was on camera before this.She was different from Saka, who was the kind that was born strong. As for Dong Yuetong, she was the type where even if she had the abilities, she would rather rely on a man. She\u2019d play the role of the poor bird who needed a man to depend on, and the man would feel the need to protect her as well.Which was why when she cried for help, it immediately triggered Xue Jinyuan.Xue Jinyuan spoke with a dark face. \u201cMr. Z, we appreciate your help with searching for Saka\u2019s body. However, Xiao Yue is Saka\u2019s younger sister and I am her fiance. This is a matter for the Tang Sect and the Xu family. We won\u2019t be needing your help, Mr. Z\u201dAs he heard Xue Jinyuan\u2019s words, Z chuckled and his cold laugh was like a calling of death from hell.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Innocent? You\u2019re calling yourself innocent after sleeping with him?!\u201dAs soon as Z spoke, the helicopter poured down photos from three huge buckets.The surrounding sea breeze was huge. The photos quickly fell from the sky and flew everywhere.Intimate pictures of the two lying in bed naked unexpectedly appeared in front of everyone.\u201cHoly sh*t, it is them!\u201d\u201cNo wonder Saka never even bothered to look at Young Master Xu. These two must have started it so long ago.\u201d\u201cShe might actually be the one who killed Saka then. If Saka were still alive, she would never end up with Xue Jinyuan.\u201d\u201cF**k! Saka had already agreed to treat my father. I can\u2019t believe these two sons of a b*tch ruined it!\u201d\u2026On this island, other than the men from the Tang Sect and the Xu family, most here still needed help from Saka.As they saw these unsightly pictures, everyone around looked at Dong Yuetong and Xue Jinyuan with disgust, mockery, and rage.Even if the River Delta was accepting of a lot of things, they were still angry at Dong Yuetong when they saw these pictures.Z snorted. \u201cJust a dog with his b*tch, you both make such a good pair. I never thought of dealing with you animals, but don\u2019t you dare play me for a fool. Now, take your woman with you and leave. If I have to repeat myself for the third time\u2026\u201d\u2018TATATATATATATATATA\u2026\u2019The mercenaries on the helicopter who held onto machine guns suddenly started shooting at Dong Yuetong and Xue Jinyuan. The bullets landed on the ground next to both of them.The soil around them splashed onto them, and it was so painful that Dong Yuetong couldn\u2019t help but scream.What he meant was obvious. If he were to repeat his words for the third time, the bullets would then be on them instead of the ground.Z was like a demon from hell who was chasing Xue Jinyuan away.\u201cFrom now onwards, I am Saka\u2019s fiance. If I hear you calling yourself her fiance again, I will kill you.\u201cAlso, keep your foxtails to yourselves, and don\u2019t let me catch you. Both of you better pray that I don\u2019t find any evidence pinning you as her killers. Otherwise, the entire Tang Sect and the Xue family will disappear from the surface of this earth.Dong Yuetong was so angry that she was about to explode.She hadn\u2019t expected Saka to still be able to trample on her dignity even after her death.Dissatisfied with the humiliation, she couldn\u2019t help but scream, \u201cSaka is already dead, so it doesn\u2019t matter who her fiance is! Since you\u2019re so capable, why didn\u2019t you protect her? Why did you let this happen?\u201dWith that, there were tears falling down her face.No one would know whether these tears were for Saka\u2019s sake or because of the rage and humiliation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The immense rage that could be seen from both his eyes was like a deep black hole that had no light.As the murderous intention grew, Dong Yuetong realized that she had made a mistake and immediately dodged.She may be quick, but Z was much faster.Dong Yuetong had no other choice but to keep her soft side and fight Z.She had grown up alongside Saka. Although she wasn\u2019t as good as Saka, she\u2019d already learned all the basics of the technique of the inner Qi. Dong Xuetong\u2019s fighting ability was even better than Xue Jinyuan\u2019s.At least when she was fighting Z, she could still fight him for a few rounds and wasn\u2019t sent flying immediately.However, even when using all her might to fight him, Dong Yuetong still wasn\u2019t Z\u2019s opponent. She realized that Z\u2019s strengths were not like the ones that Saka had taught her. Z had pure strength and durability, and he was so strong that even if she was using her inner Qi, she still couldn\u2019t defeat him.\u201cAHHHHH\u2014\u201dAccompanying the scream was Z\u2019s foot stomping onto the groundEveryone who was watching the fight couldn\u2019t help but scream along as well.Since Saka was already dead now, Dong Yuetong was the only hope left for the Tang Sect. Whether or not this woman was responsible for Saka\u2019s death, they still wanted her alive.No one would be free from illness their entire lives, and the medical skills of the Tang Sect were one of the best in the world. Dong Yuetong may not be as good as Saka, but she still had skills.\u201cBang\u2014\u201dThe deafening sound was accompanied by a huge hole, caused by Z, about half a centimeter away from Dong Yuetong\u2019s face.As the surrounding soil splattered onto her beautiful face, her entire body began shaking.\u201cXiao Yue!\u201dXue Jinyuan\u2019s face turned pale as well, but when he thought of Z\u2019s ability, he couldn\u2019t do anything but scream.Z had defeated Dong Yuetong within minutes.However, he didn\u2019t kill her with that stomp. He looked at the woman who was lying on the ground and said, \u201cIt\u2019s true that I couldn\u2019t protect her from this. It\u2019s my fault, which is why I will destroy the person who killed her. As for her, even if she\u2019s dead, she\u2019s still mine! The rest of you\u2026. GET LOST!\u201dThe Tang Sect belonged to Saka, and Xue Jinyuan was Saka\u2019s fiance, but when Saka died, it was the Sanctuary who took care of her funeral. The Tang Sect didn\u2019t even have the right to be involved with it!Since then, the Tang Sect and the Xue family became the joke amongst the \u2018big guys\u2019.********Although the previous owner had only been to Qin Yi\u2019s new house once, it was still a beautiful memory to her, which is why Jing Qian easily found the way to his house.It was a villa on the outskirts of H city. It may not be comparable to the Zhan family mansion, but this was still a wealthy suburb, which was why they had a tight security system. When the guards heard that she was going to Qin Yi\u2019s house, they took an extra look at Jing Qian and immediately gave a video call.Qin Yi was still sleeping with Jing Lu in his arms when there was a sudden knock on the door.Jing Lu uncomfortably shook Qin Yi, who was holding her, and said, \u201cBrother Qin, someone\u2019s knocking on the door.\u201dQin Yi was extremely tired from yesterday, so he couldn\u2019t be bothered with the knock on the door. When Jing Lu woke him up, he was annoyed. Just as he was about to speak, his mother\u2019s voice, which was anxious and worried, came from outside. \u201cAh Yi, quick, wake up! Jing Qian is here!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, as soon as they heard the last four words, they immediately jolted up.Because they had both moved at the same time, the moment Jing Lu jumped up, her head immediately crashed into Qin Yi\u2019s chin.A muffled \u2018boom\u2019 was heard, followed by Jing Lu letting out a scream while Qin Yi hissed in pain, tears pooling in their eyes.Jing Lu stood on the bed and covered herself with a translucent, silk nightgown. She was turning around like a headless fly, exclaiming anxiously, \u201cWhat do we do now?! What should I do?! Big sister is here! What should I do?!\u201dAs Qin Yi recalled Jing Qian\u2019s tone from last night, his face showed unprecedented panic. He quickly got dressed and exclaimed, \u201cQuick! Put on your clothes and hide your belongings in the drawer below the wardrobe! Hurry up!\u201d\u201cWhat about me? Where should I hide?\u201d\u201cJust wait for me here in the bedroom. If anything goes wrong, go to the balcony outside this room, and since the balconies are connected, just climb over to the study.\u201dJing Lu\u2019s eyes widened. She had never expected Qin Yi to ask her to climb across the balcony just for Jing Qian!However, this wasn\u2019t the time for arguments. Jing Lu quickly put on her clothes, throwing everything she couldn\u2019t pack into the wardrobe.\u201cQuick! Quick! Jing Qian is already talking to the lady at the gate.\u201d\u201cMother, why did you let her in?!\u201dQin Yi finally got dressed and opened the door, allowing his mother into the room.He couldn\u2019t help but complain as he helped Jing Lu clean the messy room.Mother Qin was anxious and frustrated as well. She joined them cleaning the room as she spoke angrily, \u201cShould I have just let her stay outside then, if I couldn\u2019t let her in? She is still considered a celebrity. What if paparazzi took pictures of her as she waited outside?\u201dWhen Qin Yi heard his mother\u2019s words, he kept his mouth shut.On the other hand, Jing Qian rang the doorbell several times before a servant came and opened the door.As Jing Qian walked into the house, the servant quickly closed the door and stood right in front of her, blocking her way.\u201cMiss Jing, why did you come to see our Young Master so early in the morning? Is there anything urgent?\u201dJing Qian looked at the servant who was standing in her way, not intending to let her into the house, and sneered. Then, she raised her finger and gently poked the servant\u2019s collarbone.The servant let out a painful exclamation and staggered back, almost falling while doing so.Jing Qian strode past him with her infamous catwalk as if she was an empress walking back to her palace.As she passed him, she replied, \u201cWhy I\u2019m here for Qin Yi isn\u2019t something that a servant should be concerned about.\u201dThe villa that the Qin family lived in was a two-story bungalow. When compared to the Zhan family\u2019s villa, even the guesthouse that Jiang Yuxi was living in was much bigger than this house.Jing Qian walked past the garden at the front yard, which was filled with fountains and fake mountains even though it wasn\u2019t nearly spacious enough to do so. Then, she pulled open the sliding door that led to the living room.At this moment, Mother Qin was one step ahead of Qin Yi, already walking down the staircase with nervous footsteps. When she saw Jing Qian, Mother Qin couldn\u2019t help but frown, immediately starting to mercilessly lecture Jing Qian.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Haven\u2019t I told you this before? Both you and Ah Yi are artists. You may be a couple in real life, but both of you are still working your way up in the entertainment industry. Therefore, you shouldn\u2019t let anyone know about your relationship.\u201cOther than that, you\u2019re married now and have become the daughter-in-law of the Zhan family. If they found out that you came all the way here looking for Qin Yi at such an hour, they would be very unhappy about it. What would you do if they withdrew their investment because of this?!\u201dWhen Jing Qian heard Mother Qin\u2019s lecture, Jing Qian was about to slap the woman, who didn\u2019t even know what was happening, but the sudden palpitations in her heart stopped her.She knew that this was because of the fear and respect that the previous owner had towards Mother Qin.This was the mother of the man she loved, so she cared a lot about Mother Qin\u2019s attitude towards her.Mother Qin was exactly like Qin Yi, the GTB. Everything that they had and used belonged to Jing Qin, but they still acted superior towards her. They definitely didn\u2019t have enough of a conscience to be nice to the person who was supporting their luxurious life.Jing Qian took a look at Mother Qin and suppressed the itchiness coming from her palm. After a while, the palpitations stopped.It was none of her business if the previous owner still cared about this woman. She was no longer the owner of this body and the woman in front of her was just air to Jing Qian. She decided not to slap her, opting to totally ignore the woman.When Jing Qian did not say a single word and immediately walked past her to go towards the staircase, Mother Qin frowned. She spoke up in an unpleasantly, loud tone, \u201cJing Qian! I was talking to you! Did you hear what I said?!\u201dHowever, Jing Qian ignored her and continued walking towards the staircase.Mother Qin was a little dumbfounded, but mostly she felt rage.The rage was due to being ignored.For the past two years, while Qin Yi and Jing Qian were dating, she always prefered Jing Lu, who was more loved by the Jing family, over Jing Qian, who was completely abandoned. Therefore, no matter how nice Jing Qian had been to Qin Yi, Mother Qin never allowed Jing Qian to be too close to her, and did not show her any type of kindness.But still, this woman was head over heels for Qin Yi, even when Mother Qin was mean to her, Jing Qian would still respect her.But now\u2026Mother Qin dashed towards the stairs. Within two or three steps, she stood right in front of Jing Qian, blocking her way up the staircase and screamed in rage, \u201cJing Qian! You walked into someone\u2019s house without permission and didn\u2019t even greet me before going upstairs. Isn\u2019t that too much, to just ignore the house\u2019s owner?! No matter what happened, you are a young woman brought up from a wealthy family, you shouldn\u2019t just run into my son\u2019s room early in the morning. Didn\u2019t you ever learn a thing or two about manners and etiquette?\u201dThe spot where Mother Qin stood was a few steps higher than Jing Qian\u2019s, which is why at this moment, she glared down at Jing Qian condescendingly. It was a furious look, similar to that of someone guarding treasure against a thief.But as Mother Qin continued to glare, the look in her eyes started changing.This was because as she furiously stared at Jing Qian, the opposite party also stared back at her.Although Jing Qian\u2019s eyes looked dull, the way she was staring back at Mother Qin sent chills down her spine.This feeling\u2026 It was similar to being stared at by a ferocious beast.Mother Qin felt like if she were to move an inch, the other person would pounce on her and eat her up.\u201cYou\u2019re living such a good life with things that I have provided for you, and yet you still look at me like this? At least a dog would be grateful to me if I gave it food! None of you are even worth being compared to a dog! How dare you talk to me about manners and etiquette?! Is there something wrong with your brain?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - Low AltitudePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43: 043: Low AltitudeMother Qin had never expected this woman, who had always respected her and been resigned to her and her son\u2019s temper, to suddenly say such\u2026 Maddening words. At that instant, she froze, and her eyes widened with an expression of \u2018I don\u2019t recognize you anymore.\u2019Just as Mother Qin was so shocked that she was wondering if she had heard wrong, Jing Qian grabbed her, pulling her aside and shouting, \u201cMove!\u201dMother Qin froze, watching Jing Qian walk up the staircase.There were thousands of words in her heart that she wanted to scream at this woman, but at this moment, all of them were caught in her throat and nothing came out.She really wanted to scream at her, but she couldn\u2019t help but suspect that this woman might be possessed\u2026How could she be so fierce towards her?As Jing Qian reached the end of the stairs on the second floor, the door to Qin Yi\u2019s room suddenly opened.There was a man dressed in a loose robe, his chest vaguely visible through it. With the loose, messy bed hair that because he just woke up, he was considered sexy and handsome. At least for the previous owner, who hadn\u2019t seen much of this world, this man was definitely attractive for her standards.However, for Jing Qian, who never lacked handsome admirers, Qin Yi\u2019s figure was just weak.Without mentioning the others, his height was only around 175 cm. The handsome suitors from Delta were at least above 185 cm. Qin Yi\u2019s height was comparable to a half-handicap at that point.Forget about 185 cm tall handsome men, let\u2019s just compare him to Jing Qian, who had worn a pair of 10 cm stiletto heels in order to match the long coat that she was wearing this morning. Her height was originally 168 cm, and with the additional 10 cm from her heels, she was now at least 178 cm.But the man in front of her was only 175 cm\u2026Jing Qian even had the urge to stay far away from this person.This was because\u2026 She felt ashamed!This was the first time she had found someone whom she had an intimate relationship with. Placing his abilities aside, she was already literally looking down on him due to his height!What should she do with him? He was too short to even be her pet!She couldn\u2019t help but then compare Qin Yi to Zhan Lichuan, who had been on his sick bed for months, since these were the two closest men in her current social sphere.She realized that even if Zhan Lichuan had been paralyzed for three months, his body figure was countless times better than Qin Yi.If she gave Zhan Lichuan a score of 85 for his figure, Qin Yi would only get an 11.This was because from the look of his figure, she seriously suspected that Qin Yi\u2019s size was a weenie, perhaps about the size of a toothpick.Even if it wasn\u2019t one toothpick, it was only two at most.11 points\u2014the additional ten points were only sympathy points that she gave him with respect for the previous owner.Qin Yi had no idea that his image in Jing Qian\u2019s mind was already completely destroyed.When he saw Jing Qian, his eyes lit up.Initially, he had already subconsciously prepared a scolding, but the woman here today was just \u2026 \u2026She was incredibly beautiful! Her beauty took away his breath, making him feel suffocated.Jing Qian had been by his side for such a long time. Other than the surprise he felt when they had first met, he found out in the beginning of their relationship that this woman was extremely gullible. She was so clean and simple, he felt dull.He had actually decided to break up with her much earlier, but when he found out that her family owned a real estate company in City H, he hesitated. After that, he eventually got together with Jing Lu, who was the princess of the family.Just when he had finally decided to break up with Jing Qian, she was spotted by the director and finally got the resources that he had been waiting for. With all these events happening back-to-back, he never got to end things with Jing Qian.When was the last time that he had been so mesmerized by Jing Qian\u2019s appearance?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was a Korean style, with a loose-fitting, dark-khaki. Although the sleeves were above the elbow, which showed her snow-white, jade forearm with a hint of playfulness, it was still a design and color that was extremely difficult for someone to style, especially for a young and ordinary girl.However, the Jing Qian who was here today was like an angel sent from god. For a piece of clothing that was extremely particular with the person\u2019s appearance, skin tone, and charisma, Jing Qian looked incredibly fashionable and dazzling.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Qin Yi, who was still stupefied in amazement, suddenly shouted.While Qin Yi was mesmerized by Jing Qian\u2019s temperament and appearance, she had already walked past him and was heading towards his bedroom.Qin Yi was shocked. When Jing Qian was already about a meter away from him, he finally came back to his senses and shouted out.As the previous owner clearly remembered everything about Qin Yi, it was extremely easy for her to locate his bedroom.Jing Qian completely ignored Qin Yi\u2019s scream and continued walking. Even if her heart was being disturbed by the previous owner\u2019s emotions, signaling that she was extremely against what was about to occur, Jing Qian kept walking towards the bedroom without any hesitation.Qin Yi was so scared that his heart almost jumped out of his chest. He got rid of the lazy and unwilling look on his face, rushing towards her in two steps and grabbing onto her wrist.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d Qin Yi\u2019s voice was extremely loud. \u201cYou came into my house without greeting my mother or speaking to me. Now you\u2019re even trying to barge into my bedroom? What is wrong with you?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to catch the mistress.\u201dIn the face of Qin Yi\u2019s rage, Jing Qian replied honestly with a calm face.\u201cAre you crazy?!\u201d When he heard what Jing Qian said, Qin Yi had a bad feeling.\u201cAs your girlfriend, I suspect that you have been cheating behind my back, which is why I\u2019m here today. Why would you call this action \u2018crazy\u2019?\u201d Jing Qian continued, answering with confidence.Qin Yi almost died of anger because of Jing Qian\u2019s calm, natural, and righteous tone. He screamed, \u201cJing Qian, there should be basic trust between humans, especially between couples. It\u2019s how they get along. Not to mention that we\u2019re not even married. But even if we were, whatever you are doing still isn\u2019t right.\u201dJing Qian sneered in reply, \u201cPerhaps you have a deep-rooted misunderstanding about the words \u2018basic trust\u2019? And there is a difference between each human being. There are countless f*ckboys in this world who are cheating on their partners. Do you think that they still deserve trust?\u201cOur relationship hasn\u2019t gotten to the point where I can trust you, which is why I\u2019m here to find the mistress you are clearly hiding. Do you have a problem with that?\u201dQin Yi was stunned by Jing Qian\u2019s words, rendered speechless. As for Jing Qian, she took advantage of Qin Yi being frozen on the spot and quickly twisted the doorknob while he was still trying to come up with an excuse.Qin Yi\u2019s face drained all its color as he saw the scene before him unravel; it was obviously too late now for him to stop her.Fortunately, the door was locked from the inside.Qin Yi and Mother Qin, who had just gotten to the door, let out breaths of relief.Mother Qin got so angry that she rushed in front of Jing Qian, screaming at her, \u201cYou are out of line! Do you even have manners? How could you come into my house without my permission? You didn\u2019t greet your elders and even said that we are worse than dogs! Now, you\u2019re trying to search my son\u2019s bedroom?! Since you don\u2019t trust him, why are you still dating him?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was obvious that she must have heard rumors about him and Jing Lu, which was why she was here to catch them today.He was the one to blame in this scenario, but despite this, his mother was still saying such things.Qin Yi even initially had plans to borrow five million yuan from her today. What if she got triggered and turned ignorant towards him again?\u201cI\u2019m out of line?! Perhaps it\u2019s you who have gotten a stroke because you woke up too early this morning?!\u201dWhen she saw Mother Qin\u2019s acrimonious face, Jing Qian refused to bear her insults any longer, and immediately retaliated.\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t introduced your son to the crew of \u2018The Palace of the Qing Dynasty,\u2019 would he still be the popular idol he is now? If it wasn\u2019t because of me, who agreed to marry into the Zhan family, giving him money and resources, do you think you\u2019d be able to own a mooncake factory, because of your son\u2019s popularity? Your entire family\u2019s fortune depends on me. None of you getting on your knees and calling me your \u2018daddy\u2019 is already enough of injustice from your side. I have been the better person to let go of it but you still have the audacity to talk to me in this manner?\u201dDepends on me?\u2018Daddy\u2019?The better person?Mother Qin\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief with every sentence that Jing Qian uttered.This was mainly because from the first time they had met Jing Qian, she was obviously the kind of person to be head over heels for a man and lose herself in the name of love. Plus, Jing Lu was the pearl of the Jing family, which was why Mother Qin had been much nicer to Jing Qian for the past two years. As for Jing Qian, she had always offered her like Buddha because of Qin Yi.However, there was something wrong with the \u2018Jing Qian\u2019 standing here today. Not only had she told her to \u2018get lost\u2019 when she first walked into the house, but now she was even asking an elder to refer to her as \u2018daddy\u2019!\u201cYou! You are just\u2026\u201dAt that moment, Mother Qin couldn\u2019t even find the right words to scream at Jing Qian.From her point of view, Jing Qian had no values.\u201cWhat were you going to say about me? That I have no manners or etiquettes? I don\u2019t respect my elders? You weren\u2019t nice to me even when I was well-mannered. Since you would be harsh to me no matter what I do, why should I even be talking to you about manners? Before trying to get your \u2018daddy\u2019 to be well-mannered, you should think if you, as the \u2018god-daughter,\u2019 have been filial enough towards your \u2018daddy\u2019! The ones who are eating shit are oppressing the ones who shat! Such bullshit!\u201dMother Qin couldn\u2019t believe her ears.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me not trusting your son? I\u2019m here to catch him red-handed! What can you do about that? I will also let you know in advance: if there is a fox inside, I won\u2019t even give you the chance to call me your \u2018daddy\u2019!\u201dWith that said, and as Qin Yi and Mother Qin were still startled from Jing Qian\u2019s words, she slammed the doorknob with her palm. All they heard was a loud \u2018bang,\u2019 and as if something inside the door had broken. With a gentle push, the door that was initially locked from the inside could now be easily pushed open.The mother and son duo were both lost for words.\u201cQianqian!\u201d Qin Yi shouted out loud, standing in front of Jing Qian in an attempt to block her.However, when he looked into her smiling eyes, he saw that they were as cold as the venom that oozed out of a Mandala Flower, all the words that he wanted to say now stuck inside his throat.\u201cMove!\u201dJing Qian pushed Qin Yi away, that force so strong that Qin Yi stumbled.The bedroom was a small suite. The outside consisted of a living room, with the real bedroom inside it. At this moment, the door leading to the real bedroom was obviously shut closed.Jing Qian strode across the living room and stood in front of the door. She raised her leg, and with her stiletto heels, she kicked open the locked door with a loud \u2018bang\u2019.Both Qin Yi and his mother remained speechless as the scene unfolded in front of them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He relaxed slightly and immediately began to comfort Jing Qian, \u201cThere is really no one here! The reason why I said that just now was because I wanted you to have more trust in me. Qianqian, we\u2019ve been dating for the past two years. Don\u2019t you have any idea how well I treat you?\u201dWhen Mother Qin saw that Jing Lu had already hidden herself, she straighten her back as she saw her chance. As she recalled all the evil things that Jing Qian had said, she sneered, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you were looking for a mistress here?! Look for her then! Didn\u2019t you say that you wanted to break up with Qin Yi?! Do it then!\u201d\u201cMother!\u201dQin Yi didn\u2019t know what to say. All he could do was yell, hoping to interrupt his mother.Couldn\u2019t she see that Jing Qian had completely changed?However, after two years of getting along in a completely different manner, Mother Qin couldn\u2019t stop, even when she had the upper hand.\u201cWhy are you screaming at me? Did I say anything wrong? She\u2019s so ill-mannered and doesn\u2019t have any trust in you. She doesn\u2019t even have basic respect for your mother! Since this woman has already said that she doesn\u2019t want to be with you, you should be the one who discards her instead!\u201dAs Jing Qian heard what Mother Qin said, she raised her brows and asked with a calm, coquettish expression, \u201cAre you sure?\u201dMother Qin remained silent.She wanted to say something back but realized that there was something wrong with this woman\u2019s expression. She bit her lips, and even though she didn\u2019t say it outright, her face had a stubborn, unyielding expression.\u201cMother! Qianqian might have offended you, but you know that I love Qianqian! Why do you always have to be so harsh on her? The two of you are putting me in a tough spot when you act like this!\u201dWhen he saw his mother\u2019s face flush red due to shame, Qin Yi continued advising them, \u201cYou know that I can\u2019t live without Qianqian. Even if she\u2019s temporarily married to the Zhan family, I will still wait for her. This is something that you agreed on as well. Why do you always have to be like this when Qianqian is here\u2026\u201dWhile Qin Yi was still expressing his thoughts to Mother Qin, Jing Qian suddenly bolted out of the room.By the time he reacted and dashed out of the room, it was already too late, as Jing Qian had already opened the door to the study room.Jing Lu, who was initially hiding in the bedroom, was eavesdropping and had realized that something wasn\u2019t right. That was why she instantly took off her heels and hid them inside Qin Yi\u2019s wardrobe. Then, she went to the balcony bare-footed and climbed over to the study room.Just as she reached the study room\u2019s balcony, she heard the sound of Jing Qian breaking the bedroom\u2019s door. She became so frightened, she almost fell off the balcony.Although by now she was inside the study room, her heart still wasn\u2019t at peace.Just when Jing Lu thought that she was safe, the room\u2019s door opened without any warning.Jing Lu suddenly raised her head and locked gazes with Jing Qian\u2019s beautiful peach-blossom eyes, which she had always envied.At this moment, the usually extremely seductive eyes were filled with an ironic look.Jing Lu\u2019s face turned various shades of red and white. As she faced Jing Qian, she did not know what to say. She was ashamed and angry, but she had no idea what to do next.Qin Yi ran into the room and saw Jing Lu sitting on the balcony of the study room. His complexion immediately became awful.Lastly, Mother Qin ran into the room as well. When she saw Jing Qian\u2019s \u2018I told you so\u2019 expression and the grey, embarrassed look on her son and Jing Lu\u2019s face, she immediately went towards Jing Lu.She helped Jing Lu stand up and said\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Jing Lu, how did you manage to fall down even when you\u2019re indoors? How are you? Are you hurt? Did you get what you need?\u201dJing Lu\u2019s mind was spinning and immediately got the hint. Her face was now tear-filled as she spoke in a pitiful tone, \u201cI looked through every spot on the table but I couldn\u2019t find it. I thought I heard big sister\u2019s voice, so I ran to the balcony. As soon as I got here, I fell and twisted my ankle.\u201dQin Yi finally came back to his senses. He instantly walked towards Jing Lu in a casual manner, helping Mother Qin support her.\u201cHow could you be so careless? Why couldn\u2019t you find it? I told you that it was on the left side of the table.\u201dEven as he was caught red handed at this very moment, Qin Yi was still talking to Jing Lu in an extremely gentle tone.Jing Qian looked at the terrible acting that everyone in the room was putting on. The only thing she could feel was the cramping pain in her heart and the pounding occurring in her head; her body was being completely drained.This was the most powerful resistance that she had felt from the previous owner\u2019s consciousness since her rebirth.Even when things were already this obvious, Jing Qian could still clearly feel the previous owner\u2019s resistance and disbelief towards this matter. There was a voice in her heart telling her to leave, urging her to believe that Jing Lu was only here to get something.Jing Qian became so angry that her face turned completely white.That\u2019s why they say you can never wake a person who\u2019s pretending to be asleep.Things had already turned out this way, but the previous owner was still torturing her body, forcing her to leave by making her feel uncomfortable?! How was this possible?!Jing Qian had initially planned for the previous owner to see for herself how messed up Qin Yi was and how b*tchy Jing Lu could be so, just so that the previous owner could move on.Who would have expected the previous owner to react this way? Jing Qian couldn\u2019t help but sneered, \u201cWow, look at this kind mother with her filial son and pitiful daughter-in-law. Such a harmonious family. Looks like I came in at the wrong time. Excuse me.\u201dWith that, she turned around and left.Qin Yi became very frightened, immediately letting go of Jing Lu\u2019s hand and dashing towards Jing Qian.Jing Lu had already put all of her weight on Qin Yi. As he ran after Jing Qian, Mother Qin was so shocked by what Jing Qian had said that she had also loosened her hand as well. Jing Lu instantly lost all the support she had just seconds before, immediately falling to the ground and letting out a loud cry.However, Qin Yi didn\u2019t bother looking at her, even when she fell to the ground. At this moment, his whole heart was focused on Jing Qian.Although she knew that Qin Yi was only doing this in order to get more resources for their future, she was too used to snatching things from Jing Qian. Even if she knew that she should be playing along with Qin Yi\u2019s performance, there was a deep sense of hatred and envy within her.Qin Yi was clearly HER boyfriend!Qin Yi had caught up to Jing Qian and reached out to pull her into his arms. As if Jing Qian had eyes behind her head, she raised her arms and landed a tight slap on his hand.It was so hard that the back of Qin Yi\u2019s hand turned red and swelled up within seconds.\u201cGet lost. Don\u2019t touch me with those filthy hands of yours, especially after touching that provocative fox. You may not be bothered by it but I am disgusted by it.\u201dQin Yi\u2019s hand froze in the air, a look of disbelief on his face.\u201cQianqian, what did you say?\u201d\u201cI said that she is a provocative fox. What\u2019s wrong? Does it break your heart?\u201dQin Yi looked surprised. \u201cWhy would you say that Xiao Lu is\u2026 She only came over because your father told her to help him get some documents.\u201dJing Lu, who had fallen to the ground, looked incredulous at this point, tears trickling down her face.Since she suffered from a congenital heart disease, she rarely exercised and was never under the sun, which was why she was so sickly pale. Along with her appearance at this moment, no one would be able to resist falling in love with her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How could you insult me in this way?\u201dAfter hearing the \u2018explanation\u2019 from Qin Yi and Jing Lu, her mood immediately turned better. Jing Qian knew that this was because the previous owner had forgiven this pair of dogs.In fact, it really didn\u2019t matter whether or not the previous owner had forgiven her. The problem here was that her body still had remnants of the previous owner\u2019s consciousness. Therefore, whenever the previous owner felt heartbroken, she would feel it as well.For a man that she despised, even if he offered to lick her foot, Jing Qian couldn\u2019t accept the fact that she felt heartbroken over him.\u201cI\u2019m insulting you?\u201d Jing Qian sneered.\u201cIn this cold winter weather, you came all the way to Qin Yi\u2019s house early in the morning, barefooted, just to get some documents?\u201dQin Yi and Mother Qin turned around and looked at Jing Lu, who was barefooted and wearing thin clothing\u2026\u201cIf the two of them had beaten you just now saying that you stole something, maybe I would believe you. However, this unique way of coming in for a document\u2026 Do you take me as a fool, or do you have some misunderstanding towards your mouth? Did you think that it is an expert in vomiting ivory, thinking that everything you said would appear to be the truth?\u201dJing Lu was confused. Her head was spinning in circles until she suddenly thought of the saying \u2018you will never find ivory in a dog\u2019s mouth.\u2019Did that mean that Jing Qian was calling her a dog?Last night on the phone with Qin Yi, she had called her a b*tch! Today she was calling her a dog!Jing Lu glared at Jing Qian. She couldn\u2019t believe that Jing Qian had dared to say such vicious words in front of her.Qin Yi\u2019s head was pounding because of the two sisters, quickly explaining, \u201cQianqian, you\u2019ve misunderstood her. Xiao Lu only came here because of the documents.\u201dWith that, he quickly walked to the table and started searching around.\u201cHmm? I remember placing it here on the table last night.\u201dAfter that, he bent down by the table and opened one of the drawers next to it. Then, he scavenged through the drawer and pulled out a file. Qin Yi let out a breath of relief and said, \u201cOh, my bad. The document wasn\u2019t on the table, it was inside these drawers.\u201dHe then passed the document to Jing Qian and said, \u201cSee, take a look. This is the document that Jing Lu was looking for. My mother wanted to expand her factory and required additional capital, which was why we needed to get a foreign loan. Your father thought that since the two of us are in a relationship, investing in my mother\u2019s factory would be similar to your investment, which was why he has decided to invest 100 million yuan as a shareholder.\u201dBased on Qin Yi\u2019s understanding of Jing Qian, she knew nothing. Even if the document was given to her, she wouldn\u2019t even read it, which was why he came up with all these excuses.Who would have expected Jing Qian to take the document without any hesitations?Qin Yi couldn\u2019t believe his eyes!However, Jing Qian casually looked through it, then threw the documents back to him, which instantly reassured him.It was such a short period of time. It was impossible she could have noticed anything wrong with it.Jing Lu saw her chance and immediately started acting, \u201cBig sister, you\u2019ve really wronged me!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, Qianqian. You\u2019ve accused Xiao Lu.\u201d Qin Yi immediately turned to Jing Lu and reassured her, \u201cXiao Lu, your sister has been in a bad mood for the past two days. You have to forgive her. I\u2019ll apologize on her behalf.\u201dFollowing that, an aggrieved Jing Lu shook her head as tears rolled down her face. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem as long as there are no unnecessary misunderstandings between you and big sister.\u201dAs she watched the pair in front of her put on a show, Jing Qian couldn\u2019t help but think about how this pair of dogs were really sticking to their scripts for money.Jing Qian was wearing a set of Bluetooth headphones, which was why Qin Yi didn\u2019t hear him when she made the call. As soon as it was answered, she switched it to speaker mode. When Father Jing\u2019s voice came out of the phone, Qin Yi\u2019s pupil immediately shrank.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How are you doing in the Zhan family?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, father. Remember when you asked me for a loan? Didn\u2019t you mention that your company is short on funds? Why did I just hear that you are now investing 100 million yuan into the factory that Qin Yi\u2019s mother owns?\u201d\u201cWHAT?\u201d The voice on the other end of the call suddenly rose, exclaiming, \u201cWhen did I say that I would be investing 100 million yuan?!\u201dQin Yi already knew that this was going down the wrong way. Just as he went to open his mouth, a glare from Jing Qian frightened him so badly that all the words became remained inside his throat.At this moment, Jing Qian\u2019s eyes were like a venomous snake, making him feel that as soon as he spoke, he would be poisoned to death.\u201cCould you ask Xiao Lu to come onto the phone? I have a movie opportunity here and I wanted to see if she would be interested.\u201dJing Qian smiled. The edge of her lips rose as she looked at the face that was bitter just a moment ago. The same face was now filled with extreme embarrassment. This delicate-looking woman had a vicious look in her eyes; they were glistening seductively with a hint of chilliness present.On the other end, Father Jing\u2019s voice rang again, \u201cReally? You should quickly call Xiao Lu. She went to Yanjing\u2019s house yesterday, this girl who she\u2019s really close to in her class. Yanjing\u2019s parents were going to be out of town these two days and she was afraid of being alone, so Xiao Lu decided she would keep Yanjing company.\u201d\u201cYanjing? I don\u2019t think she\u2019s in H City.\u201d\u201cOh, since the next two days are holidays, Jing Lu decided to make a trip to Yanjing\u2019s house. You should directly contact Xiao Lu, or I can make the call as well. But tell me about this movie. What is the genre of the movie that you chose for Xiao Lu? Who\u2019s the director? Will Xiao Lu be the first female lead or the second?\u201dBeginning to talk about Xiao Lu, Father Jing started talking non-stop.Jing Qian looked at Jing Lum who was now as pale as a dead person, with a smile that said, \u2018Gotcha, you dirty provocative b*tch.\u2019Then, she answered her father, \u201cOh, there\u2019s no need for that now. I suddenly remembered that they\u2019re giving this movie to another artist.\u201d\u201cEh? How could you\u2026\u201dFather Jing\u2019s voice was filled with a mixture of confusion and anger, but Jing Qian had already ended the call.All three of them froze in surprise upon seeing her action.At that moment, all of them were feeling extremely awkward.\u201cShe\u2019s here for the document? Your mother wants to cooperate with my father? Hmmm\u2026\u201dThe \u2018hmmm\u2019 in the end was the reaction you would have after tasting the world\u2019s best green tea.The look on Qin Yi\u2019s face was extremely ugly. He had no other choice but to continue spewing bullsh*t.\u201cQianqian, listen to me. It\u2019s not what you think. Xiao Lu and I are innocent! Last night, she did go over to her friend\u2019s place, and coincidently, I was there for a shoot. There, I met Xiao Lu when she and her friend, Yanjing, were being bullied by a bunch of gangsters.\u201cI managed to save them, but she had injured her ankle, which is why I brought her home. She was worried that Uncle Jing might scold her, so she decided to stay here for the night.\u201cWhen you came barging into my house this morning, she got nervous and made up a lie. Qianqian, don\u2019t you trust me?\u201dAs soon as he wasn\u2019t talking, Qin Yi heard the sound of a call being answered once again.\u201cHello?\u201d a familiar voice said from the phone, and Qin Yi could feel his heart sinking.\u201cBrother Liu, I made plans with Brother Qin to go to Huzhen yesterday, but I can\u2019t seem to contact him.

If you don\u2019t believe me, I have a video of him being in the company for the entire day.\u201cBut, Jing Qian, Qin Yi is now a rising idol. You can\u2019t keep pestering him like you did before. If the fans found out about the two of you, it would be the end of his career. If you don\u2019t want this to happen, you should stay calm instead of asking for his whereabouts every day, or-\u201dJing Qian was not interested in what Liu Gang had to say after that. She immediately hung up and looked at the ghastly-looking Qin Yi with an innocent smile. \u201cHmmm\u2026 A shoot? Perhaps from what you know of me, I\u2019m mentally retarded?\u201dQin Yi had no idea what he could say at that point.Jing Qian turned around and was about to leave when Qin Yi ran after her.He thought that Jing Qian would leave directly, but instead, she went back into his bedroom and headed straight towards his wardrobe.\u201cQianqian!\u201dQin Yi tried to stop her, but Jing Qian firmly pushed him away.Qin Yi was pushed so hard that he stumbled a few steps backward and fell on his butt, almost rolling over on the ground.Jing Qian, on the other hand, used the opportunity to open the doors of the wardrobe.When she pulled open the second drawer, Jing Lu\u2019s undergarments, clothes, pants, shoes, and lingerie were all openly displayed.At this moment, Jing Qian could feel a piercing pain coming from her heart and head as her face turned pale.Qin Yi, who was sitting on the ground, turned pale as well.Mother Qin and Jing Lu rushed into the room soon after and saw that Jing Qian had managed to take out all of Jing Lu\u2019s clothes, which were hidden in the drawer. Both of their faces were flushing red due to awkwardness.However, other than the embarrassment seen on Jing Lu\u2019s face, her eyes held a sense of pride from successfully snatching Jing Qian\u2019s belongings.Ever since they were kids, as long as it was something that belonged to Jing Qian, she would want it. How could they be biological sisters, but Jing Qian had such an alluring appearance?Not only did she look good, she had a good body and also good health.But what about her? She didn\u2019t share the same appearance, and worse, she even suffered from congenital heart disease.All she could do was watch Jing Qian get attention and praise for her beauty and kindness.This was why she hated Jing Qian!Her goal since childhood was to take away all the attention that Jing Qian received, along with everything that belonged to her.This included Qin Yi!When she saw the pale look on Jing Qian\u2019s face and the large droplets of sweats on her forehead as Jing Qian learned of Qin Yi\u2019s betrayal, Jing Lu was jumping with happiness on the inside.She was standing by the door, pretending to be innocent, while her eyes flashed with unconcealable excitement after this mass destruction.\u201cQianqian, listen to me! You have to listen to me!\u201dQin Yi knew that he had f**ked up, trying to grab onto Jing Qian. However, Jing Qian took out some boots from the drawer and immediately threw them towards Qin Yi\u2019s head.Although she didn\u2019t have her \u2018inner Qi,\u2019 her strength was still much stronger than that of an ordinary person.With that, Qin Yi immediately fell backward because of the impact, even knocking over a chair that was behind him.\u201cBrother Qin!\u201d Jing Lu cried in distress as she ran towards Qin Yi.When she saw the bump on his head, she turned around and scolded Jing Qian, \u201cBig sister, this is all my fault. I am the one to blame for all this. I fell in love with Brother Qin and I couldn\u2019t control myself, which is why I came to his house and refused to leave.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why did you have to blame it on Brother Qin? You\u2019re the one whom he\u2019s loved since the beginning. You know he\u2019s a celebrity and he has important events to appear at all the time. How would he be able to show his face in public if you beat him up?\u201dJing Qian was hurting all over, feeling as if something was trying to break out of her body.Her condition was awful as huge droplets of sweat appeared on her forehead.Jing Qian no longer wanted to speak to this group of GTB. If she hadn\u2019t wanted the previous owner\u2019s subconscious to see what kind of a scumbag this man was, she wouldn\u2019t even have bothered coming here early in the morning and wasted so much time talking to them.She was tired of seeing this pair of dogs publicly displaying their love for one another, so she turned and walked away on her stiletto heels.As she walked towards the door, no longer paying attention to them, Mother Qin grabbed onto the edge of her coat and held on to it tightly.\u201cStop! Jing Qian, Jing Lu is your younger sister and Ah Yi is your boyfriend, who you have loved so dearly for the past two years. Jing Lu has already told you that she didn\u2019t do this on purpose and Qin Yi has tried to explain the situation to you since the very beginning. Even when you were rude to me, with no manners or respect, he was still on your side. I think that you should be more forgiving in this matter. Don\u2019t be unreasonable with this, okay? Just forget about this and move on. Do you really want to end up losing Qin Yi?\u201dWhen Jing Qian stopped walking and turned around, Mother Qin thought that she managed to convince Jing Qian. Therefore, she continued, \u201cYoung one, you shouldn\u2019t talk about breaking up with someone so easily. Otherwise, the other party might misunderstand and actually break up with you.\u201dJing Qian looked at Mother Qin, who was still acting superior and arrogant even while she was trying to mend things.\u201cWhat made you think that I\u2019m not doing this for real?\u201d she questioned.Qin Yi was stunned. He immediately stood up and went to grab Jing Qian\u2019s arm. However, as Jing Qian \u2018gently\u2019 pushed him, Qin Yi was like a small, white flower amongst the wind. He ended up on the ground once again, with stars in his eyes due to the fall.Even Mother Qin and Jing Lu thought that Qin Yi had gone overboard with his action.However, Qin Yi was the only one that was truly shocked.Since when did Jing Qian get so strong?\u201cI don\u2019t agree with the breakup. There is no such thing as \u2018break up\u2019 in my dictionary!\u201dQin Yi\u2019s eyes turned red as he looked at the charismatic Jing Qian, whose appearance was extremely delicate and beautiful. At this very moment, he felt that he had shown his true feelings.If even he was touched by himself, he believed that Jing Qian would be touched by him as well.As she looked at Jing Lu, who was next to Qin Yi, she saw an envious look in Jing Lu\u2019s eyes that could no longer be hidden.Jing Qian smiled with her plump, red lips, mocking him, \u201cThere\u2019s no such things as a \u2018break up\u2019\u2026 Only something known as \u2018cheating\u2019? So it\u2019s okay to say that you\u2019re cheating, but I can\u2019t break up with you?\u201dQin Yi was shocked as he looked at Jing Qian. He couldn\u2019t believe that not only was she not moved by his act, she even had the audacity to say such insulting words.\u201cI\u2019m not asking for a divorce. I don\u2019t need your permission for a breakup. What were you even thinking? Hmph\u2026 Forget it! The two of you can continue with what you were doing. May happiness be with you, today and always!\u201dJing Qian\u2019s disdain caused Mother Qin to panic.Qin Yi and her used to live under someone else\u2019s roof in H city, their lives only improving because of Jing Qian.It\u2019s true that they wouldn\u2019t revert back to their previous state even without Jing Qian, but at this moment, she was the daughter-in-law of the rich and powerful Zhan family. Not only would she be getting 100 million yuan each year as pocket money, she would also be able to provide an endless amount of resources for all of them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, now that we\u2019ve split, she\u2019s nothing to me.\u201dQin Yi was once again at a loss for words.Qin Yi had no idea how to deal with Jing Qian, who was suddenly asking for a breakup with such venomous words. All that was now left was devastation and disbelief.\u201cBig sister, it really is my fault. Can you forgive me? I know that you\u2019re just angry with me, but you still love Brother Qin. You can\u2019t end things with Brother Qin just because you\u2019re mad at me. It\u2019s true that I spent the night here, but I stayed in the guestroom.

It\u2019s not her fault! You should blame me for that! I shouldn\u2019t have let her marry someone else. I should have kept her by my side!\u201dWith that, Qin Yi turned around and said to Jing Qian, \u201cQianqian, I\u2019m sorry. This is all my fault. I promise that this will never happen again in the future. You are my one and only girlfriend, and the only woman that I will ever love in my entire life. Xiao Lu may have stayed over at my place last night, but I swear to god that I did not touch her. I\u2019ll tell you my whereabouts and you can always look for me. You can punish me however you want as long as we don\u2019t break up.\u201d\u201cI can do whatever I want as long as we don\u2019t break up?\u201d Jing Qian asked sarcastically as she looked at Qin Yi\u2019s affectionate expression.\u201cYes! As long as we stay together, you can punish me however you want!\u201d Qin Yi\u2019s face, which was previously hopeless, suddenly glowed with possibility when he heard Jing Qian\u2019s question.\u201cOkay then!

She screamed in a very loud voice, \u201cGo ahead! But you have to remember, Qin Yi is a rising idol. You\u2019ve wasted two years of his life. According to his value right now, each endorsement cost at least 8 million yuan. Taking 12 endorsements into account for the year, it would total up to at least 100 million yuan. Since you\u2019ve dated him for two years and wasted his time, that would be a total of 200 million yuan. I won\u2019t ask much for the compensation, you only have to pay 5 times the amount. That means you can only break up with him after compensating him 1 billion yuan!\u201dSince the Zhan family was only giving her 100 million yuan each year, it would mean that it would take her at least 10 years to get 1 billion yuan. After 10 years, she would be worthless; even if she refused to break up with Qin Yi, Qin Yi would dump her anyways.Mother Qin had it all planned out in her head. However, life didn\u2019t work that way. It isn\u2019t always going to play out the way you imagined it would.\u201cAre you an idiot?\u201dMother Qin paused.\u201cDo you think your son is an actual piece of gold, and his value would increase no matter where he went? Well, in my opinion, he is just a crumpled up tissue that I used to like. I only kept him by my side because it was on a discount. But then, before I could use it, Jing Lu already used it to wipe her a**. You are telling me that I should appreciate this piece of filthy sh*t, and if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll have to compensate you for keeping this disgusting thing because he\u2019s valuable? Even if you think that this piece of junk is beautiful, you should get Jing Lu to treasure it instead, since you\u2019ve always preferred her.\u201dWith that, Jing Qian turned and looked at Qin Yi, who was ghastly pale, speaking in a unceremonious tone, \u201cThe one thing that I, Jing Qian, hate the most in my entire life are disgusting f*ckboys who cheat. For a GTB like you, I am horrified to even be acquainted with you. Therefore, be a smart man and stay away from me. Don\u2019t ever come close to me. Otherwise, don\u2019t blame me for not letting you go for old time\u2019s sake.\u201dQin Yi was speechless.Lastly, she turned to Jing Lu and smiled, \u201cHe\u2019s your man now, and no longer your brother-in-law. If anything happens, please deal with it together. Don\u2019t try to bring me into this, or you won\u2019t be able to blame your big sister for slapping you after this!\u201dJing Lu bit onto her lower lip, an aggrieved expression on her face.Mother Qin looked at Jing Lu and her son, who were so badly bullied that they couldn\u2019t even retaliate, and gave a cold laugh. \u201cOh? Now that you\u2019ve found someone to depend on, you think that you can just get rid of us? Jing Qian, I\u2019ll put forth the truth. If you dare split up with Qin Yi without any compensation, don\u2019t blame me for suing you. You are a celebrity yourself. When you get blamed and scolded by the fans, followed by being abandoned by the Zhan family, don\u2019t come crawling back to us, blaming us for being so merciless!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.

The pain that was coming from both her chest and her head made it seem as if her body wanted to shake her soul out of it.Jing Qian was panting with pain as she sat in the car, but a smile appeared on her face.She decided to just let the pain continue.If she didn\u2019t go through this, this body of hers would still be in control of the remaining subconsciousness of the previous owner in the future.But this pain was getting\u2026 A little too much.At last, Jing Qian was in so much pain that she couldn\u2019t take it any more and fainted.By the time she woke up, it was the same ward and the same scene with Butler Xu wearing the same suit, looking at her with the same judgemental look as the first time.Jing Qian had no idea about what was happening.She thought that she returned to the time when she first came into this body.Jing Qian continued staring at Butler without saying a word.\u201cYoung Mistress, you\u2019re awake? How are you feeling? Is there anything that\u2019s making you feel uncomfortable?\u201dJing Qian looked at Butler Xu and faintly asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cYoung Mistress, don\u2019t you remember? You fainted by the side of the road. How do you feel?\u201dJing Qian took the time to judge her body\u2019s condition.The pain from before had completely disappeared and the obsession that the previous owner left in her body was gone as well.Jing Qian knew that the terrifying pain from before was the remnants of the previous owner.Now that Qin Yi and Jing Lu had completely destroyed the last of it, the remaining consciousness in her body was now all gone.Jing Qian finally had total control of this body.\u201cDoes the car have a GPS system?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dButler Xu didn\u2019t know how to respond to that question.The Young Mistress\u2019s logic seems to be always different from his; their chain of thoughts were never the same.\u201cIt isn\u2019t noon yet, which means that it hasn\u2019t been long since I fainted on the side of the road. It didn\u2019t take long for you to find me because I only parked there for a short period of time. The only explanation is that the car has a GPS system. You guys saw that the car had been immobile for quite some time which is why you guys may have thought that something bad happened.\u201dWhen facing the Young Mistress, who was certainly smart to a certain extent, Butler Xu immediately told the truth.\u201cThe Zhan family is a wealthy and well-known family. There are a lot of people who may be after us. In order to prevent any accidents, our Third Young Master has placed a tracking device in all of the cars. This is done to ensure the safety of every member of the Zhan family.\u201dJing Qian raised her brows. Did this mean that Zhan Lichuan knew about where she went this morning?So, did it count that Zhan Lichuan had caught her red-handed?It shouldn\u2019t, right?She only went there for a breakup.When Butler Xu saw Jing Qian in a trance, her face looked as if she got caught red-handed. As he realized what had happened, he wanted to stomp out in rage.\u201cYoung Mistress, please tell me that you did not meet up with that \u2018lover\u2019 of yours?\u201dJing Qian did not know how to answer him.It\u2019s true that they met, but she went there to end things between them!Does that count?Jing Qian\u2019s face was full of questions.When Butler Xu saw that Jing Qian had difficulty answering him, he once again started his lengthy family lecture.\u201cYoung Mistress, oh! Young Mistress ! Why can\u2019t you just let go of it? Although our Third Young Master is tied to the bed and may not be able to move, isn\u2019t he better than all the other wild men outside?\u201dSeeing that Jing Qian was still keeping quiet, Butler Xu continued, \u201cAfter saving the Young Master this morning, did you know that our Master has changed his opinion about you?!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. It\u2019s something that I should do anyway.\u201d Jing Qian showed a professional smile.Butler Xu was shocked at how unreasonable the Young Mistress was.\u201cYoung Mistress, please don\u2019t assume that you can cheat on the Third Young Master just because you saved his life. The Third Young Master is the pearl of the Zhan family. If the Master found out that you\u2019ve cheated on him, he would never let it go. Please! Forget about that man! Otherwise, you\u2019re making it difficult for us as well!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Did the Third Young Master tell you that?\u201dButler Xu\u2019s face had a look that said, \u2018I can see through your expression.\u2019\u201cYoung Mistress, speak from your own conscience. Did you not go over to your \u2018lover\u2019 today so that you could spend some quality time with him?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Jing Qian answered without any pressure, since she went there for a break,up. She definitely wasn\u2019t there for some quality time.Seeing how calm Jing Qian was, Butler Xu chose to trust her.\u201cFine then. Since you denied it, I\u2019ll trust you. But please, do not forget the things that I\u2019ve just told you, Young Mistress. This isn\u2019t a joke.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Jing Qian waved her hand. She got down from the bed and asked, \u201cHas anyone told you that you are a little long-winded?\u201dNow, Butler Xu turned speechless.When he saw Jing Qian leaving, Butler Xu immediately asked, \u201cYoung Mistress, where are you going?\u201d\u201cHome.\u201dWith that, Jing Qian once again walked away, leaving an unruly, enchanting figure for Butler Xu.\u201cBut we still have to wait for your report! You can\u2019t leave!\u201d\u201cThere will be no problem with my report. My body is fine.\u201dButlet Xu became anxious, insisting, \u201cIf you really were fine, why did you pass out for so long in the car? Young Mistress, since we\u2019re already here and I even talked to the Dean, it doesn\u2019t hurt to just stay a little longer. Let\u2019s just wait for the Dean to confirm your situation before leaving.\u201dJust when he finished speaking, a beautiful, young woman in a white robe with a charismatic temperament, with a hint of exhaustion in her eyes, was amongst a group of doctors that were walking towards them.\u201cQianqian? Where are you going?\u201dWith the memories of the previous owner, Jing Qian immediately recognised the person standing in front of her. The second miss of the Zhan family, Zhan Lichuan\u2019s elder sister\u2014Zhan Shuyu.Jing Qian greeted her and replied, \u201cI\u2019m about to head home.\u201dWhen Butler Xu saw her, he quickly walked up to them and bowed towards Zhan Shuyu.\u201cSecond Miss, Young Mistress is insisting on leaving the hospital. Is that okay?\u201dZhan Shuyu smiled and said, \u201cSure, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Just remember to get more rest when you\u2019re home.\u201dJing Qian nodded without saying another word while Butler Xu replied, \u201cThat\u2019s great. Thank you, Second Miss.\u201dZhan Shuyu continued smiling as she spoke, \u201cWell, you should thank Qianqian instead. If it wasn\u2019t because of her, Lichuan would still be in danger. God knows how badly Lichuan would have suffered because of it. Therefore, Qianqian is now the hero of the Zhan family.\u201dWhen Butler Xu heard her words, he laughed and immediately agreed with what she said.\u201cThat\u2019s right! The Young Mistress really is our Third Young Master\u2019s lucky star! However, the Zhan family is also extremely lucky to have you watching out for them. It is indeed Third Young Master\u2019s blessing. If it wasn\u2019t because of you, Master wouldn\u2019t have been able to find Master Jingyuan and we would never have found Young Mistress.\u201dZhan Shuyu sighed, then said, \u201cIt\u2019s too bad that just as I told grandfather about Saka, she died.\u201dJing Qian was listening to the conversation between Butler Xu and Zhan Shuyu but she was not interested in it at all.She was only brought into the Zhan family in order to bring good luck for them. As long as she did her job, she would leave the Zhan family. As for the dramas within the Zhan family, she did not care about them at all, as long as they did not drag her into it.\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this. Grandfather told me to go back today. Since Qianqian is also going home, I\u2019ll tag along.\u201dThen, Zhan Shuyu turned around and said a few things to her colleagues. After that, she left the hospital together with Jing Qian.When they got into the car, Jing Qian could feel Zhan Shuyu staring at her. She couldn\u2019t help but raised her brows and asked, \u201cSecond Miss, you\u2019ve been looking at me for quite some time. Is there anything wrong?\u201dZhan Shuyu was stunned by the sudden question, then smiled and replied, \u201cNothing, it\u2019s just that you seem different from before.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s\u2026 I just like you better now, when compared to before.\u201dJing Qian laughed and said, \u201cSo Second Miss didn\u2019t like me before?\u201dZhan Shuyu thought about it for a while before answering her. \u201cSince I\u2019m the one who brought you into the Zhan family, if your actions weren\u2019t compatible with the Zhan family, it would be my fault. But it\u2019s good now, you don\u2019t talk as much, and you even saved Lichuan\u2019s life. I hope that you\u2019ll be able to blend in better with the rest of the Zhan family soon.\u201dZhan Shuyu\u2019s eyes were smiling and as she was talking to Jing Qian, her face did not show any arrogance from being the only miss in the Zhan family. She seemed friendly and very approachable.\u201cWell, I shall live up to your words then. I will definitely get along with the Third Young Master.\u201dFrom the beginning, Zhan Shuyu had been giving her the hint that \u2018she was her person,\u2019 which was why Jing Qian could only subtly tell the other party that she was only here as the \u2018lucky star.\u2019She would only be involved with Zhan Lichuan.Zhan Shuyu understood the hidden meaning, which is why she decided to keep quiet. The smile on her face deepened, but no one would know if it was genuine or not.As Butler Xu was listening to their conversation, he initially felt that it was hopeless trying to help the Young Mistress, but now he was greatly impressed by her EQ.When you\u2019re in a wealthy family, you should know where you stand.Jing Qian knew that she had to be on the Third Young Master side rather than choosing any other sides. This was obviously the best choice.Right at that moment, Jing Qian\u2019s phone rang, showing that it was Una who was calling.Una was her manager, and she was also Qin Yi\u2019s aunt. When she was unconscious earlier, Una had called her about 20 times.A flash of sarcasm flashed through Jing Qian\u2019s eyes and she answered the call in front of Zhan Shuyu and Butler Xu without any hesitation.\u201cJing Qian, tell me, why did you go over to Qin Yi\u2019s this morning and cause all that commotion?!\u201dJust as Jing Qian was about to open her mouth, the other party\u2019s voice bombarded her like a canon. That sharp, piercing voice of hers was so loud, Jing Qian had to move her phone further away from her ears with a frown on her face.Because the other person\u2019s voice was extremely loud, everyone in the car could clearly hear the entire conversation.\u201cDon\u2019t you know that you and Qin Yi are celebrities?! I\u2019ve already told you this before! Without my permission, you are not allowed to look for Qin Yi. But what did you do? You went all the way there, early in the morning, and even waited right in front of his house. You didn\u2019t even bring your assistant along with you!\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of paparazzi taking photos of the two of you? Aren\u2019t you worried that someone will realize that you and Qin Yi are a couple? I\u2019m telling you now, if the paparazzi find out about this, you are to bear all the PR fees and to compensate Qin Yi for ruining his reputation!\u201dButler Xu felt as if he had been struck by five lightning bolts at the same time!!!How thick faced could this Young Mistress be? How could she deny that she had looked for her \u2018lover\u2019 with such a calm expression?!The other party was screaming at her, but she was still listening to her with such a tranquil expression.This\u2026. This was exactly what they called \u2018dead pigs aren\u2019t afraid of boiling water\u2019!Zhan Shuyu, who was beside her, couldn\u2019t help but feel her face darken when she overheard the conversation.Jing Qian was the only one who remained calm throughout the call, not paying any attention to their facial expressions.Instead, she asked the other party, \u201cAre you my manager, or are you Qin Yi\u2019s manager? If you are Qin Yi\u2019s manager, then I\u2019ll end the contract with you tomorrow. You can go ahead and work for Zhongze Entertainment.

As his aunt, don\u2019t I have the rights to lecture you on this matter?\u201d\u201cWhat makes you think that you have the right to lecture your artist just because you\u2019re their manager? Don\u2019t forget, I\u2019m the one who brought you to Zhongbo Entertainment. Who gave you the balls to scream at me this way? Qin Yi? Then you\u2019re screaming at the wrong person.

If you want to scream at someone, please scream at her.\u201cAlso, I don\u2019t know if there were paparazzi, but if anything from this morning gets leaked to the press, I\u2019ll make sure that Qin Yi fails so badly, there will be no way for you to save him!\u201dWithout waiting for the other party to reply, she immediately ended the call.Zhan Shuyu looked at Jing Qian, lifting her brows but not saying a word.Since they had already overheard the conversation, it was clear that Jing Qian must have gone over to the \u2018ex\u2019 to clear things up. It didn\u2019t matter if she was the one who initiated it, because the result would still be the same.As for Jing Qian, as soon she ended the phone call, she sat with her legs crossed like a gangster. Her posture was even more arrogant than the second miss of the Zhan family.Butler Xu could not believe what had happened before him. Was he invisible to her?When they arrived at a Chinese medicine center, Jing Qian got out of the car. Butler Xu offered to leave a car and a driver behind but was mercilessly rejected.Zhan Shuyu looked at Jing Qian\u2019s retreating figure and commented, \u201cQianqian is a good seedling. Not only is she beautiful, she\u2019s also filled with potential. She has only been here for a few weeks, but her temperament is already so different.\u201dButler Xu chuckled, \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dHowever, he wasn\u2019t sure if it was her potential, or had she always been this way.******Jing Qian had searched this place on the internet last night. Moxibustion Hall was the best Chinese medicine center in H city, and it had everything that she needed.Therefore, as soon as she stepped into Moxibustion Hall, Jing Qian did not waste any time. She immediately called for the sales assistant and told her to get the things that she needed.As most of the things that Jing Qian asked for were herbs that were extremely expensive, the sales assistant immediately regarded her as a valuable customer. As a result, her service was filled with enthusiasm.After picking out all the herbs that she needed, Jing Qian also picked out a few utensils that she would need to make the medicine. In the end, she also picked out the most treasured silver needles in that store.Although she wasn\u2019t really satisfied with them, these were the only ones that she could get for the time being.\u201cGreetings, ma\u2019am. The total is 21,570 yuan, and since the amount spent is more than 5 thousand in a single transaction, we will be giving you a 22% discount. The total is now 18,981 yuan.\u201dJing Qian slowly took out a card from her bag and passed it to the sales assistant.When the sale assistant saw that it was a black card, her eyes began to glow.This was because she also had an account in the same bank. Therefore, she knew that only those who had savings of more than 50 million would have this card in their possession.The sales assistant smiled, and she took the card with both hands. However, when she swiped the card, her mouth couldn\u2019t help but twitch. She passed the card back to Jing Qian and said in an awkward tone, \u201cMa\u2019am, your card balance is insufficient. Why don\u2019t you try another card?\u201dJing Qian was confused.Didn\u2019t she get 100 million yuan from the Zhan family?What the f**ck?!!She remembered that the previous owner had given her parents 50 million and the GTB would have borrowed about 10 or 20 million from her. She was sure that it wasn\u2019t 50 million. What happened to all the money in her card?The depressing issue here was that she knew that she was broke, but even so, she was confident that she still had about 20-30 million in her bank. It was definitely sufficient for her to support herself for the next 2 months, which was why she didn\u2019t bother checking.Well, guess who was in deep sh*t now?When she saw the sales assistant looking at her as if she was the God of Wealth, this was the first time Jing Qian felt embarrassed because of money.Dong \u2014\u2014\u201cMaster!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The sales assistant right in front of Jing Qian immediately dashed towards the old man that was on the ground.The old man was dressed in a customized, handmade Chinese tunic suit. Although she couldn\u2019t see his face, by the look of how the rest of the bodyguards rushed towards him, she was sure that this old man was someone important.At that moment, since everyone\u2019s attention was on the old man, Jing Qian decided that it was time for her to leave as well.She had three main principles in life.First, don\u2019t save those who she didn\u2019t want to, even if they were rich! Second, don\u2019t save those who she didn\u2019t like! Third, don\u2019t save those who liked bullying others with their status!This was also why most of the wealthy, powerful people with status didn\u2019t like her in her precious life. After dealing with her several times, they realized that she was someone extremely difficult to deal with and liked seeking revenge for the smallest action. In the end, most of them ended up as her sworn enemy.This was how her reputation got worse, and the number of people who wanted her dead increased.However, as she walked past the old man, she stopped after realizing who the old man was.She knew him. Although they had never met, she knew who this old man was while she was investigating \u2018that man\u2019. She had thoroughly checked his entire family during the investigation.She would admit that in her previous life, other than Dong Yuetong, that man was someone whom she really had feelings for. However, after getting to know him, it all changed. She wasn\u2019t sure if it was because of her disease or her personality, but as he forcefully suppressed her feelings for him over and over again, she got more and more reluctant to approach him.At one point, she even started to dislike him, wanting to stay far away from him.If it wasn\u2019t because she had chosen to die in the end, they would have already broken up by now. They might have even turned into enemies.Jing Qian stood next to the old man, her eyes reamined dull but her heart was contemplating.Then, a few of the store\u2019s doctors came running. One of them told the rest to call 120, while another immediately started doing chest compression on the old man. When Jing Qian saw what was happening, she immediately walked over to the doctor and pushed him aside.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d When the doctor got pushed away, his face started fuming with rage.\u201cDo you know that you\u2019re stopping me from saving this man? Move aside!\u201dWhen the other doctor noticed what was happening, he immediately came forward to push Jing Qian to the side. The bodyguards also came towards her, about to grab her in an attempt to prevent her from causing any more chaos.\u201cDid you even know what was wrong with him before you started doing chest compression? Will you be responsible for his death?\u201dThe doctor who was being questioned was pissed. He immediately shouted back at Jing Qian, \u201cLook at how he held his hands by his chest! It obviously shows that he felt pain coming from his chest, which means that his heart is the one affected. That is a classic sign of a heart attack.\u201cWhenever an elderly person has a heart attack, the most important thing to do is to resuscitate the heart. If we miss the first 5 minutes, his condition will worsen and even the best doctors on earth won\u2019t be able to save him! So I will do this whether or not I can save him.\u201cAs for who would be the one responsible for him if anything happens, we have security cameras installed all over. There are so many kind-hearted people out there who would save people on the streets, but not everyone is responsible for the death of the person that they\u2019re trying to rescue, right?\u201dWhile he was saying this, the bodyguards were already next to Jing Qian, both trying to get a hold of her.Who would have expected them to freeze as soon as Jing Qian glared at them with a cold look in her eyes? Both their hands, already stretched forward, abruptly stopped midway.When the doctor saw the look in Jing Qian eyes, his heart trembled as well.Although the girl standing right in front of him seemed young, the look in her eyes was like that of a venomous snake. With just one look, one could feel the treacherous, cold feeling coming from her.\u201cHow would you know that he\u2019s having a heart attack? Did you even check? Who told you that he had a heart attack? Those who save people by the streets are being righteous, but you are a doctor. If you kill the person that you\u2019re trying to save, it becomes a malpractice.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Other than the doctor and the two bodyguards closest to her, no one else would have realized what happened; even the other bodyguards around the old man didn\u2019t notice.\u201cDoes the patient have a heart condition? What about his blood pressure and cholesterol level?\u201d the doctor quickly asked the bodyguards.The bodyguards quickly nodded, \u201cOur master does have coronary heart disease and he once had a coronary bypass surgery. He has had attacks before, but none of them were as bad as this.\u201dThe doctor looked towards Jing Qian. When he saw her looking like a gullible young girl who wouldn\u2019t bite, he immediately said to her, \u201cDid you hear what they said? The patient has had coronary heart disease and even had a bypass surgery done! His face is already turning blue and he can\u2019t even talk. It\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s a heart attack!\u201d\u201cHe has a pneumothorax, which led to a heart attack. He\u2019s already having trouble breathing. If you continue to press on his chest, his heart will stop beating as well.\u201dEveryone around them was shocked; even the doctors were taken aback.If it wasn\u2019t because of Jing Qian, all of them would have assumed that this old man was having a heart attack. However, now that Jing Qian mentioned it, they noticed that the old man\u2019s mouth was indeed open, trying to gasp for air. It\u2019s just that he couldn\u2019t say anything.It really did look like he had a pneumothorax.\u201cDoes the patient have pneumothorax?\u201d the doctor couldn\u2019t help but ask.At that point, his hands, which were extremely close to the old man\u2019s chest, had already been lifted.The bodyguard in charge quickly shook his head.\u201cMaster has been having problems with his heart and legs, but he never had a pneumothorax.\u201d\u201cEven if he never had it before, that doesn\u2019t mean that he isn\u2019t having one now, and it definitely doesn\u2019t mean that he will never have it in the future.\u201dJing Qian\u2019s words put both the doctors and the bodyguards in a tough spot, as no one could be responsible for it.At last, the doctor gave in and said, \u201cWe are only a Chinese medicine center that sells herbs. We don\u2019t have the necessary equipment and first aid supplies. What this young lady said is reasonable. If this man has a pneumothorax, doing chest compressions would only hasten his death. We\u2019ve already called 120, so why don\u2019t we just-\u201d\u201cAHHHHH!\u201dAll of a sudden, everyone around them started screaming.When the doctor was busy talking, Jing Qian had reached for the swiss knife in her bag. Just when everyone around was still flustered with what was happening, Jing Qian thrust the knife into the site right below the old man\u2019s neck.Everyone around screamed and the bodyguards were distraught as they started panicking.When they came back to their senses, some of them went forwards, trying to arrest her. However, Jing Qian snatched the disposal medical kit that was in the doctor\u2019s pocket.When she saw the bodyguards getting close to her, Jing Qian replied with one word\u2014\u201dMove!\u201dFrom their point of view, it looked like Jing Qian didn\u2019t have any intention of harming their master, so the only thing they could do now was wait anxiously.There was a tube inside the kit. Jing Qian immediately took out the tube and placed it into the bloody hole she had created using the knife.A hissing sound similar to a gas leak came from the tube as gas started rushing through it.After waiting for a while for the gas to continue being passed out from the tube, the old man\u2019s complexion became better.The faces of all the doctors and bodyguards waiting by the side turned pale.Thank god!If it hadn\u2019t been for Jing Qian\u2019s reminder, they would have treated his problem as a heart attack.The man was already having trouble with his lungs, needing help to breathe. If they had continued with the chest compression, they would have pumped out all the air that was originally inside his lungs. The man would have probably died even faster than before.At this point, the doctor was longer angry at Jing Qian.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If this man had died in their center, not only would it be bad for their reputation, but both the doctor and the center would be in big trouble. Looking at the number of bodyguards that this old man had surrounding him, it was obvious that he was someone important.\u201cHi Miss, I am this gentleman\u2019s butler. We really appreciate what you have done for us today. Everything that happened today was too abrupt and since I\u2019m the only one here today, we won\u2019t be able to do much for you. Please give us your contact number so that our master will be able to thank you personally later on.\u201dEveryone around them, including the doctors next to her, looked at Jing Qian with envy.It was obvious that this old man was not an ordinary person. The reward given to her would be extremely generous.\u201cI just happened to have seen someone else do the same thing while trying to save another person. Instead of thanking me, why don\u2019t you just help me buy a few things right now?\u201dThe butler paused before asking her, \u201cWhat is it that you would like, Miss?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with my card, which is why I couldn\u2019t pay for the things that I was trying to buy. You could help me with that.\u201d\u201cOf course, of course. No problem.\u201dThe butler immediately paid for Jing Qian\u2019s items.Seeing that Jing Qian was leaving with her things, the butler immediately spoke up, \u201cMiss, please give us your contact number. It\u2019ll be easier for our Young Master to thank you personally.\u201dWhen she heard the words \u2018Young Master,\u2019 Jing Qian\u2019s eyes lit up and she quickly rejected the offer, \u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary. I didn\u2019t do much and you\u2019ve already paid for my things. We\u2019re even now.\u201d\u201cBut Miss\u2026\u201dThe butler tried to block her and was still trying to get her contact number. However, when he saw the ice-cold look in Jing Qian\u2019s eyes despite her smile, he was stunned. He had no choice but to allow her to leave with two large bags.As soon as she stepped out of the place, she got a call from Una.After experiencing Jing Qian\u2019s extremely vicious new attitude, Una had called Qin Yi. When she learnt about Jing Qian\u2019s actions that morning, Una panicked.Therefore, this time, she spoke in a completely different tone.\u201cQianqian, first, I would like to apologize for my behavior earlier.\u201dJing Qian held both the bags in one hand but continued walking effortlessly. She looked so elegant; it was as if she was just holding onto something extremely light.She held onto her phone with her other hand, a cold smile slowly appearing on Jing Qian\u2019s lips as she said, \u201cYou should apologize to me. You\u2019re not my biological child, and as your \u2018daddy,\u2019 I don\u2019t have to tolerate you unconditionally. Therefore, I hope you\u2019ll remember your position and situation. Don\u2019t start lecturing me about things that are not important.\u201dUna didn\u2019t know how to react to this.However, she could feel the difference in Jing Qian\u2019s attitude, which was why she convinced herself to suppress the anger raging inside her heart.\u201cOkay, it\u2019s my fault for screaming at you before asking about the truth. I\u2019ve talked to Qin Yi. He really did regret bringing Jing Lu to his house last night.\u201cBut Qianqian, think about it. You\u2019ve been with him for two years and he hasn\u2019t even touched you once. Do you think he would have touched Jing Lu?\u201d\u201cThe reason why he hadn\u2019t touched me was because I didn\u2019t allow him to. It definitely wasn\u2019t because he was a gentleman. You\u2019re saying that she only stayed for one night, but I found her undergarments hidden inside the wardrobe in Qin Yi\u2019s room when I was there in the morning.\u201cDo you take me for a fool, thinking that I will believe everything you\u2019re saying?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She didn\u2019t know how to continue with that conversation, but she had no other choice.\u201cQianqian, this is indeed Jing Lu\u2019s fault. You are her elder sister but she seduced your boyfriend when you weren\u2019t around. But you know Qin Yi well; he\u2019s just someone who\u2019s really soft-hearted. We should just let bygones be bygones. We\u2019re humans, not god. We\u2019re allowed to make mistakes in our lives, right?\u201dAs Jing Qian listened to what she had to say, she looked at the street opposite of her, seeing a middle-aged man feeding ice-cream to a young girl who was at least 20 years younger than him.They were feeding ice cream to one another, the looks in their eyes were filled with so much love.As Una continued talking on the phone, the smile on Jing Qian\u2019s face grew and she took a few pictures of the scene that she was seeing.\u201cYou called me just to tell me all this?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s another issue,\u201d Una said in a stern tone. \u201cI\u2019ve decided on the cast for \u2018Mirror World.\u2019 I just need you to sign some paperwork tomorrow at the office.\u201dJing Qian\u2019s beautiful peach-blossom eyes deviated upwards, forming a nice-looking curve. This time, it wasn\u2019t because the words sounded funny.She had no idea what the other party was saying\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re just a manager, but you\u2019re casting for the show? When did you become the producer and the director?\u201dUna fell into a deep silence for a while. Then, her voice suddenly rose an octave higher as she began screaming at her.\u201cQianqian, what\u2019s wrong with you?! Have you forgotten about our promise?!\u201dUpon hearing her reply, Jing Qian immediately understood what had happened. It must have been one of the things that the previous owner did for Qin Yi and his family.\u201cOh\u2026 I fell from the stairs yesterday and suffered from a small concussion. I also lost part of my memory.\u201dUna became speechless, the words sounding like a joke to her.\u201cHave you forgotten about \u2018Mirror World\u2019?\u201d\u201cNot everything about it. I still remember that it\u2019s a drama that the Zhan family invested in for me. I\u2019m the female lead.\u201d\u201cNo, but here\u2019s what happened.\u201d Una quickly explained, \u201cHuanrui Entertainment has also invested in this drama. Therefore, in order for Qin Yi to be the first male lead, Yunxiao from Huanrui can only act as the second lead.\u201cHowever, Yunxiao is a well-known actor and he comes with a really strong background. In order for him to let go of the role of the first male lead, I negotiated with them and Huanrui finally gave their reply. If Zhongbo agrees to let go 20 pips and allow Yan Meiqi to be the first female lead, Yunxiao wouldn\u2019t mind being the second lead.\u201d\u201cHold up!\u201d Jing Qian felt that something wasn\u2019t right, and she immediately questioned Una. \u201cWhy is Qin Yi acting as the first male lead in a drama that the Zhan family invested in for me? I was supposed to be the first female lead, so why do I have to give it up to Yan Meiqi?\u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is that I have to be the second lead in a drama that the Zhan family invested in for me? Additionally, they have to give up on 20 pips? Is there something wrong with your brain?\u201dUna became extremely mad when she heard Jing Qian disagreeing with her suggestion, saying sternly \u201cWhat on earth is wrong with you, Jing Qian? Did you break your head yesterday when you fell? You were the one who agreed to giving up everything that you have in order to help Qin Yi. I\u2019ve gone out of my way to discuss this matter with all the producers, and now that they\u2019ve agreed, the only thing left to do is for you to sign the documents. Zhongbo will be giving up on 20 pips and Qin Yi will be offered a role. If you\u2019re asking questions now, all my precious effort before this will have gone the drain.\u201dJing Qian laughed out of anger, as she was getting triggered by Una.For her entire life, she was the only one who cheated others. She would always avenge towards those who tried cheating her, and make sure they regretted doing it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Since the previous owner had a soft personality, it was easy for everyone to think that they could simply trick her.\u201cUna, you\u2019ve tricked me so unscrupulously. Aren\u2019t you afraid that I might fire you? Don\u2019t forget that you work for me. You\u2019re telling me that I have to be the second lead because of Qin Yi? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the one who has an injured head. Are you sure you\u2019re not the one who fell and lost your brains?\u201dThe voice from the other end rose another octave, \u201cJing Qian, what are you trying to say?! Are you saying that you don\u2019t want Qin Yi as the first male lead? How could you do this to Qin Yi? He\u2019s your boyfriend!\u201d\u201cNo, no, no, Una. Please don\u2019t corrupt the word \u2018boyfriend\u2019 for me. If you continue saying that word, I may never want to be married. He\u2019s just a piece of sh*t that Jing Lu used to wipe her ass. Do you still think that he qualifies as my boyfriend? I have to sacrifice my role for him? And the Zhan family has to give up 20 pips because of this?\u201cAm I the one who broke my head, or do you have worms in yours? Why would you think that I would willingly let go of such an opportunity? Well, let me tell you now that you\u2019re out! You\u2019re a manager who only thinks for Qin Yi, I don\u2019t need you anymore.\u201dWith that, Jing Qian ended the call before the other party managed to say anything.Initially, Jing Qian thought of going shopping at one of the largest complexes in the city because her taste in fashion was extremely different from that of the previous owner. However, when she thought about how she couldn\u2019t even afford the items before this, which only cost 10 thousand yuan, her excitement died down.This was so embarrassing!She really wanted to know how and why all the money in her bank was gone.By the time she walked out of the alley that she just turned into, all the bags that she was holding were gone.As she logged into her bank account and looked through the transaction history for this month, she realized that when the Zhan family gave her 100 million yuan, she immediately gave the Jing family 50 million. Then, on the same day, she gave Qin Yi\u2026 Another 20 million!After that, part of the money was transferred to Qin Yi\u2019s account on several occasions, all of that totaling up to 20 million.As for the remaining 10 million, she used it on shopping.With the transaction history and the vague memory that she has from the previous owner, Jing Qian recalled that with the remaining 10 million, she bought Mother Qin a bangle that cost 4 million. With the 6 million that she had left, she used 1 million on her own clothes, and the rest were spent at a store that sold men\u2019s clothing and accessories.When she saw a picture on her phone with Qin Yi dressed head to toe with clothes from the same store, Jing Qian wanted to reach into the screen and drag him out so that she could beat him up.Just as she was looking through each and every transaction, which caused a raging fire in her heart, she received a message from Una.It was a contract.As she opened it, she saw that this was an agreement that she had signed with Una when she got married.The contract stated that in order to make up for Una\u2019s loss after shifting her from Zhongze Entertainment to Zhongbo Entertainment, she could never terminate her contract with Una. If that happened, Jing Qian would have to pay a compensation fee of 200 million yuan.After reading through the contract, Jing Qian was completely speechless towards the actions of the previous owner.She had gone out of her way to provide the best for Qin Yi.But she really didn\u2019t understand how Qin Yi was considered handsome\u2026Soon, another message came. It was from Una as well.\u2018I can be fired, but you would have to be prepared with 200 million yuan before doing that or pay me 200 million worth of commission fees in advance. Qianqian, I understand that Qin Yi cheating on you with your sister is a horrible thing, but this isn\u2019t why you should break up with him. Both of you should help each other grow together.

However, after catching my dearest sister and my ex sleeping with each other, my goals have changed. As for the compensations\u2026 Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll prepare a huge present for you before you leave.\u2019Una was already frustrated from before. She thought that by showing her the agreement that they had both secretly signed, Jing Qian would give in to her.Instead, she got this reply in return.\u201cPresent? What present? Is this the attitude she would have if she was willing to give in or pay the compensation fees?!\u201dQin Yi, who was next to her, has a unsightly expression on his face as he bit his lip and kept his mouth shut.\u201cYou! You knew that Jing Qian was deeply in love with you! And of all people in the world, why did you have to mess around with that sick girl? That sickling is always going after Jing Qian\u2019s things by acting weak. Did you really think that Jing Qian was silly enough to truly take her as a sister? Anyone in their right mind would hate Jing Lu! Now that you\u2019ve been caught sleeping with her, what do you expect from Jing Qian?!\u201dQin Yi did not dare to refute the accusations from his aunt.This was because before he became popular, he and his mother were dependent on his aunt, which was why he still subconsciously felt inferior to her.Out of frustration, Qin Yi ran his hand through his messy hand and covered his face with his large hands.When he removed his hands, his face looked even more dejected than before.\u201cWhat should I do now? Qianqian seems really angry this time. I\u2019ve never seen her this mad. I tried getting her back, but she was really mean. She totally ignored me.\u201d\u201cWhat should you do? What else can you do now?!\u201d Una was filled with rage. \u201cShe\u2019s your girlfriend, so you tell me. What do you think you can do now? If she was willing to marry the quadriplegic from the Zhan family, it shows that her love for you is immeasurable. Therefore, it is impossible for it to be so easily broken and forgotten.\u201cYou should beg her for forgiveness. Although it is easy to earn a fortune in the entertainment industry, resources are still limited, since they belong to a few large companies.\u201cYou initially had the best resources and should have been able to live a prosperous life with her helping you. But look at what you did!\u201dMother Qin had been sitting next to her this whole time with a wry face. She wasn\u2019t happy listening to her younger sister arrogantly reprimanding her son.Her husband had left them at a young age and her sister was the one that supported them. Although Una was the one who helped Qin Yi start his career, she was still uncomfortable with Una scolding her son. She was determined to make a fortune from the factory that she owned so that they could soon cut ties with Una.Otherwise, the two of them would always feel inferior to her.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Qin Yi\u2019s fault! If it wasn\u2019t because of Jing Lu, who kept disturbing him, why would he end up with her? Plus, Jing Lu\u2019s family owns a real estate business, but Jing Qian isn\u2019t well-liked in her family. It was obvious that Jing Lu was the better choice amongst the sisters. Who would have expected that crazy woman to turn up in our house early in the morning?\u201dMother Qin was getting angry and she stood up for Qin Yi.\u201cBig sister!\u201d Una turned and looked at Mother Qin with a stern look. \u201cYou can\u2019t have the best of both worlds! You already own a business, and it seems to be making money which makes you a wealthy person. Why don\u2019t you know the basics?\u201cQin Yi has been pampered all his life, but now he has a choice to make between Jing Qian and Jing Lu.\u201cIf he chooses Jing Qian, he would have a bright future in the entertainment industry. If he chooses Jing Lu, he would have to depend on Jing Lu his entire life as a live-in son-in-law of the Jing family.\u201cYou have to make up your mind now.

I will never let go of Jing Qian, no matter what my relationship with Jing Lu turns out in the future,\u201d Qin Yi looked extremely determined.The Jing Qian that he saw today was 100 times more attractive than Jing Lu. Why hadn\u2019t he noticed that Jing Qian was so stunning before this?As for Jing Qian, who had successfully proven to the previous owner how sh*tty those pair of dogs were after catching them red-handed, she immediately blacklisted Qin Yi.She had no idea that even after she made herself crystal clear, the other party still thought that she was just playing hard-to-get.Jing Qian was hacking Una\u2019s phone as she initially wanted to check if there were still any secrets that she wasn\u2019t aware of between her and Una. However, she realized that Una\u2019s daughter, Peng Miaoqi, who was also her junior in college, had sent a message saying that her friend, Xue Ning, was coming over tonight.She wanted her mum to inform the housekeeper that they had a guest coming over tonight.As Jing Qian looked through the phone to get the agreement, along with other things that interested her, an evil smile appeared on her face when she saw this message.When Jing Qian returned to the Zhan mansion, she immediately headed to Zhang Lichuan\u2019s room.Because she forgot to knock, Jing Qian saw an exquisite-looking robot cleaning Zhan Lichuan\u2019s body when she went into the room.The robot\u2019s joints were very flexible and its movements were very smooth. It was different from the other robots that obviously screamed the message \u2014 \u2018I am a robot.\u2019Other than being made entirely out of metal, the things that it was doing were exactly the same as what a normal human would do; even the minor joints of the fingers were very agile.Zhan Lichuan never expected anyone to suddenly walk into his room.This was because he had just gotten back from the hospital and he was cleaning himself, making him completely naked in front of Jing Qian.Zhan Lichuan was looking at her but he soon realized that this woman\u2019s gaze wasn\u2019t even at his body. Her eyes were completely glued to his robot.This woman had been drooling when she saw his body last night. Did she already lose interest in him?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, this time, she turned and looked at Zhan Lichuan with a shining look in her eyes.\u201cThis is so cool! It has emotions and preferences?!\u201dThen, Jing Qian immediately turned to the robot and asked, \u201cWhy did you scold me though? I\u2019m so pretty, don\u2019t you like me?\u201dThe robot was created based on Zhan Lichuan\u2019s figure, which was why the robot was much taller than Jing Qian. She was looking at the robot with her neck stretched backwards, and the person who was seductively charming before this suddenly turned into a cute, naive-looking woman.However, the look that she had in her eyes while staring at the robot was exactly how a monster looked at Tang Shanzhang**.Zhan Lichuan didn\u2019t even notice that as he stared at Jing Qian acting this way, his eyes overflowing with happiness.The emotionless tone of the robot appeared once again, \u201cYou touched my hand. I hate getting touched by others.\u201d\u201cThis is a robot with OCD!\u201dJing Qian was in love with this robot. This was because in her previous life, she owned a robot to accompany her as well. However, that robot that she bought was acting as if its brains were hampered, and she didn\u2019t like it very much.Now that she finally found one that was exactly what she always wanted, and with such temperament, Jing Qian was over the moon.\u201cWhere did you buy this robot? I want one as well!\u201d Jing Qian looked at Zhan Lichuan, her peach-blossom glistening and shining at him.Since the robot\u2019s hands were touched, it didn\u2019t properly place the blanket on Zhan Lichuan, and as a medical professional, Jing Qian casually pulled the blanket and made sure that it completely covered Zhan Lichuan\u2019s body.He was still a patient after all. The toxins in his body weren\u2019t completely cleared and it would be bad for his surgery in the future if he contracted pneumonia from a cold.However, before Zhan Lichuan could say anything, the arrogant and bad-tempered robot opened its mouth,\u201cHmph, stupid woman. I\u2019m one of a kind. You want to buy another me? Do you even deserve it?\u201dJing Qian\u2019s eyes widened as she got scolded by the robot and looked towards Zhan Lichuan, who hadn\u2019t said a single thing to her since she walked into the room.She asked with that questionable confidence of hers, where she thought that the other person would definitely answer her, \u201cWhat\u2019s up with your robot? Why does it have such a \u2026. Characteristic temper?\u201dZhan Lichuan, who was looking at Jing Qian\u2019s face the entire time, naturally replied to her without any hesitation when he heard the question.\u201cI was the one who set\u2026 Its character.\u201dHe initially wanted to reply, \u201cJust like me,\u201d but he stopped himself when he remembered that Jing Qian had been getting scolded by the robot ever since she walked in but she was also the one who gave him a massage last night and she even saved his life. Although he no longer wanted to be alive, he didn\u2019t really feel like dying before knowing who the real culprit behind all of this was.Facing his savior, Zhan Lichuan felt that he should at least maintain basic manners and etiquette. He immediately changed the words that he was about to say, just so that this little girl wouldn\u2019t be saddened by his words.Well, who would have expected that Jing Qian would complement him instead?\u201cThat\u2019s cool!\u201dShe wanted a robot just like this, which was cool and loyal. It would only serve her and would simply ignore everyone else. If anyone were to touch it, the robot would be able to roast them. It would be perfect if the robot even knew how to fight.**TL note: Tang Shanzhang a central character in the 16th century novel Journey to the West by Wu Cheng\u2019en.

We\u2019ll just have to overcome it and everything will get better soon.\u201dWhen she said this, she was actually thinking of her own past.As she looked back, she had the looks, the fame, the power, and the fortune. She already had everything, but she still felt as if she was living in a deep, dark hole and her entire world was grey and hopeless.The hopeless feeling that she felt was probably similar to what Zhan Lichuan was feeling right now.Therefore, for someone like Jing Qian, who never really cared about her patient\u2019s feelings, this was miraculously the first time that she had ever comforted her patient.When he heard what Jing Qian said, a ripple formed in the peaceful waters that were usually seen in Zhan Lichuan\u2019s deep, dark eyes.He thought about how Jing Qian had given him a targeted massage yesterday, along with what she did to save his life this morning. His sixth sense even felt a sense of anticipation because of what she said. It was something that had never occurred ever since he became paralyzed.He always felt that the reason why she could casually say things like, \u201cYour loss of motion is just temporary,\u201d was because this was her true intention. It wasn\u2019t said to him as words of comfort.Zhan Lichuan looked at the girl whose eyes were now glued on the robot. She was looking at the robot with undisguised passion and eagerness.\u201cYou really like it?\u201dThis was the first time that Zhan Lichuan spoke to Jing Qian.\u201cEn,\u201d Jing Qian nodded with undisguised possessiveness.\u201cOnce I\u2019ve recovered and I can start walking, I\u2019ll make you another one that\u2019s better than this\u201dJing Qian\u2019s eyes shuddered, and her beautiful peach-blossom eyes were glistening; it was as if they were filled with stars.\u201cYou promise?!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t go back on my words.\u201dThe two of them came to a tacit agreement.Initially, she thought that since she was occupying Jing Qian\u2019s body, she should at least do something for her \u2018boss.\u2019 She had planned to only leave after successfully treating Zhan Lichuan, and she never thought of asking for anything from the Zhan family.But now, she would be getting the robot that she always wanted and it was something that she wouldn\u2019t be able to buy anywhere else in this world. Jing Qian felt that she was the one who made a profit from this deal.In fact, even if Zhan Lichuan didn\u2019t offer, she would also have made a business deal with him, intending to buy the robot after his recovery.As for the \u2018mistress hunting\u2019 business this morning\u2026 Both of them tactfully kept quiet about it.From Jing Qian\u2019s point of view, she felt that there wasn\u2019t a need for her to explain herself to Zhan Lichuan since she was only here to counteract his bad luck.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 - Used you as an excusePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 68: 068: Used you as an excuseAs for Zhan Lichuan, this marriage only happened because it was prompted by Master Zhan. He just passively accepted it. As far as he was concerned, he didn\u2019t want to burden anyone . With his handicapped body, it would be imporrisble for him to have any relationship with anyone. Plus, he had already investigated where Jing Qian went this morning, and roughly knew what happened to her.He totally agreed with what Jing Qian did. That man did not deserve a girl like her.Just as they were happily chatting, Jing Qian\u2019s phone rang again.When she saw who it was, her brows subconsciously frowned.Her parents had already passed away when she was five, but with the memories that she had of them, she would always rate them 5 stars.After her parents died, she used the money that they left for her, and with some hard work, she turned herself into a rich, world-famous woman.Therefore, for her, the word \u2018parents\u2019 always brought her warmth.However, in the memories of the previous owner, her family did not bring her such sweet memories.Since they were kids, Jing Qian had to give in to her sister all the time. If there was a conflict of interest between both the sisters, her parents would always choose Jing Lu\u2019s side without any hesitation.\u201cHello,\u201d Jing Qian picked up the call.\u201cWhere are you?\u201dThis was Mother Jing. Her voice was stern, and it felt much like an interrogation.\u201cHome.\u201dJing Qian\u2019s answer gave Mother Jing a huge shock, but then she realized that the \u2018home\u2019 that she was referring to was the Zhan family, not the Jing family.\u201cCome home tonight,\u201d Mother Jing commanded.\u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201dJing Qian\u2019s answer was short and strong.\u201cYou\u2019re busy?\u201d Mother Jing raised her voice and questioned her, \u201cYou\u2019re a Young Mistress in the Zhan family. You don\u2019t even have to clean the house. What would you be busy with?\u201d\u201cChatting with my husband.\u201dZhan Lichuan was lying on the bed. His eyes, which were originally motionless and as dark as obsidian, suddenly moved when he heard these words.It was like a ripple rising from the depths of a lake. There were no obvious lines that formed on the surface, but beneath it, there were numerous waves forming.This was the first time anyone had addressed him in this way.He always felt that this marriage wouldn\u2019t affect him, and it wouldn\u2019t change him, but at this moment, he suddenly realized that something had changed.This was a peculiar feeling.The other side of the call was silent, and Mother Jing said with dissatisfaction, \u201cYou weren\u2019t sold to the family, you were married into the Zhan family. Why should they be bothered if you come back to your own family? I don\u2019t care. You must come home for dinner tonight.\u201dJing Qian was prepared to retaliate towards her, and just as she opened her mouth, the phone call ended.Jing Qian was speechless.This was the first time in history that someone had hung up on her!!\u201cYou can go back whenever you want. Your mother was right. You weren\u2019t sold to the family, you married into the Zhan family. I don\u2019t need you to stay just to talk to me.\u201d\u201cI know. I was just using you to fool her.\u201dThis time, it was Zhan Lichuan who was speechless.If he remembered it correctly, this girl only agreed to marry him because of her family, right?In order to bring fortune to her family, she married a paralysed man. In order to provide her fianc\u00e9 with more resources, she agreed to be married to a quadriplegic. But now that she had already broken the engagement with her fianc\u00e9, she was still using him as an excuse. She didn\u2019t even want to return home.What was his dear wife up to?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He would be angry if we go in right now.\u201d\u201cBut- Young Mistress is already inside. She\u2019s already seen the Young Master\u2019s body, and if we don\u2019t enter to help, will he be angry at us?\u201d Yun Zhou was struggling.Zhe Yan hesitated for a few seconds before saying, \u201cBut\u2026 Young Master did not call for us.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t\u2026 Why don\u2019t we just wait and see? We\u2019ll go in when we hear the voices get louder or perhaps when the Young Master gets angry?\u201dSuddenly, the living room\u2019s door opened.When they saw that it was Zhan Shuyu, Zhe Yan and Yun Zhou greeted her with respect, \u201cSecond Miss.\u201dZhan Yushu raised her brows and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with both of you? Why are the two of you frowning?\u201dYun Zhou hesitantly spoke up, \u201cIt\u2019s the Young Mistress. She has once again opened the door from her room and directly entered into the Young Master\u2019s room.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re a married couple now, what\u2019s wrong with Qianqian looking for Ah Chuan?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because the Third Young Master has been in a bad mood recently, and he isn\u2019t in the mood to speak to anyone. Plus, Young Master was cleaning his body. He\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll have a look then,\u201d Zhan Shuyu interrupted Yun Zhou. She knocked on the door a few times, then pushed the door open.Inside the room, Jing Qian was smiling brightly as she spoke to Zhan Lichuan, and there was a faint smile on Zhan Lichuan\u2019s face that none of them had seen before.The smile may have been extremely faint, one an ordinary person would not have been able to notice on his stern, strict face. However, as a sister who loved her brother dearly, Zhan Shuyu always kept a close look over her brother. Therefore, even if it was a minor facial expression, she would be able to notice it immediately.When they saw that it was Zhan Shuyu, Zhan Lichuan greeted her.\u201cSister.\u201dA huge smile immediately bloomed on Zhan Shuyu\u2019s face.\u201cIt looks like Qianqian has been keeping you in a good mood.\u201dZhan Lichuan looked at the woman who looked extremely tired and asked, \u201cAre you at the hospital these days?\u201dThe smile on Zhan Shuyu\u2019s face grew.\u201cAh Chuan, I\u2019ve managed to contact Lawrence Institute of Medical Research. They were interested in the newly developed anti-hypertensive drugs available in our Chuantou Medical Institute and would like to cooperate with us. In exchange, I\u2019ve requested that Professor Hongsu, the deputy director of Lawrence Institute of Medical Research, treat you. She is a genius in neurosurgery. They are currently considering it.\u201dThe Lawrence Institute of Medical Research was the world\u2019s top medical research center, but when Zhan Shuyu told him about this, Zhan Lichuan did not seem to be interested at all. When compared to the surprise that the Lawrence Institute would bring, he had a feeling that Jing Qian would be able to surprise him more.Although he shouldn\u2019t compare Jing Qian to the Lawrence Institure, this was just a feeling he was getting from his sixth sense.Just when Zhan Shuyu was talking to Zhan Lichuan, there was a knock on the door once again.This time, it was Master Zhan and Zhan Yuheng.When Jing Qian saw her \u2018boss,\u2019 she naturally got up and greeted him.As for Master Zhan, who once again saw Jing Qian inside Zhan Lichuan\u2019s room, Master Zhan\u2019s face, which was initially awful, turned much pleasant looking, and he greeted Jing Qian as well.After talking to Master Zhan, she turned and looked at Zhan Yuheng.Zhan Yuheng thought that this woman was about to greet him, which was why his lips began to curl upwards. However, Jing Qian looked at him magnanimously, then she looked away, like an autumn breeze sweeping away fallen leaves. She didn\u2019t even intend to talk to him.When Zhan Yuheng realized what happened, the corner of his lips reverted and the look in his eyes deepened.Zhan Lichuan, who was lying on the bed, saw the entire scene and Zhan Yuheng\u2019s expression. His eyes turned dark as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had a handsome appearance and a man like him deserved the attention of every woman in the room.However, when there were two stars shining together, it changed things. As long as you stand next to the one that is shining the brightest, your light would still be less compared to the other, no matter how bright you are.Zhan Yuheng and Zhan Lichuan were exactly like these stars.\u201cThird brother, you look good today.\u201d\u201cWell, big brother, you don\u2019t look too good yourself. You should get some rest.\u201dBoth were saying caring words to him, but Zhan Lichuan\u2019s attitude towards Zhan Shuyu and Zhan Yuheng was extremely different.For some unknown reasons, Zhan Lichuan, who would usually pretend to play nice, suddenly decided that he didn\u2019t want to be the nice guy today.Zhan Yuheng and Zhan Shuyu were both called back to the Zhan Mansion because of Master Zhan\u2019s command, the reason being he wanted them to come clean. He wanted to find out who was the culprit that had tried to harm Zhan Lichuan by changing the plants in his room.However, none of them admitted to it.Zhan Shuyu had always been close to Zhan Lichuan, which was why the targeted person here was just Zhan Yuheng.At this point, Zhan Yuheng was already pissed, which was why he had an extremely awful facial expression.However, with Master Zhan standing there, Zhan Yuheng had no other choice but to keep the stiff smile on his face and continue talking to Zhan Lichuan.Now he got targeted by Zhan Lichuan for no apparent reason.Zhan Yuheng was unhappy about it, but he still kept a warm and gentle smile on his face.\u201cYou\u2019re right. Well, I\u2019m not as smart as you, and without you around, I\u2019ll have to take over your duties. Not only do I have to deal with the matters in Zhongbo Entertainment, I also have to tend to matters in our main corporations, which is why I didn\u2019t get to rest much these two days.\u201dZhan Shuyu sneered, \u201cSince Big brother is complaining about being tired, why don\u2019t you let someone else take over some of the projects in the corporation? Why don\u2019t you let me help you? You want to occupy it, yet you\u2019re complaining about being tired. You\u2019re just a dog in the manger.\u201dThere were no words that Jing Qian could use to properly describe her feelings.WOW!She initially thought that Zhan Shuyu was an elegant superwoman who would always put on a nice smile. Who would have expected her to be such a tough woman? Now that she was up against Zhan Yuheng, who was extremely tough, would they be fighting in front of Master Zhan?!Zhan Yuheng smiled and said, \u201cThis is my responsibility. I don\u2019t think I should trouble you, sister, since I still have both the uncles to help me out. It may be a little tiring, but I feel content. Second sister, you should just focus on medicine and find a way to cure our brother. I\u2019m still waiting for Third brother to come back to the corporation.\u201dJust as Zhan Shuyu was about to say something back, Zhan Yuheng immediately turned to Master Zhan.\u201cGrandfather, I forgot to tell you that I\u2019ve found a doctor who will be able to operate on Third brother.\u201dWhen Master Zhan heard Zhan Yuheng\u2019s words, he wasn\u2019t surprised. Instead, there was a questioning look in his eyes.Master Zhan narrowed his eyes and asked, \u201cYou found a doctor? Who is it? What background do they come from?\u201d\u201cXu Fang told me today that his uncle runs a business at the Delta River, which is why he knows someone from the Lawrence Institute of Medical Research.\u201dZhan Shuyu couldn\u2019t help but tease, \u201cBig brother, don\u2019t you know that Chuantou and Lawrence Institute are working together? Instead of asking for help from Xu Fang, I can do it myself. I forgot to inform you that I\u2019ve been personally talking to someone from the institute and they\u2019re going to send Professor Hongsu for Ah Chuan.\u201d\u201cOh? So Second sister has been in contact with the Lawrence Institute of Medical Research?\u201d Zhan Yuheng smiled and asked in a stern tone, \u201cAfter talking to them for such a long time, did you know that the Lawrence Institute actually belonged to the Tang Sect?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If it\u2019s possible, it should be the Master of the Tang Sect, Miss Dong Yuetong, who will be doing the surgery for Third brother.\u201d\u201cYou managed to contact Dong Yuetong?\u201dMaster Zhan had only found out about Dong Yuetong from the news last night. He had already personally contacted her, but there was no response from the other party. It was as if his message had sunk into the deep sea. Despite the fact that he was the wealthiest man in H City and the Op corporations were the best in the technology industry in Country Z, he still didn\u2019t get a reply from them. Even when he had offered a generous reward, they continued to ignore him.Master Zhan was anxious about this issue, but he had never expected Zhan Yuheng, the grandson whom he never had any hope for, to suddenly bring up this topic.\u201cYes, grandfather. I actually heard of Saka earlier and tried contacting her through Xu Fang two months ago, but Saka was not receiving any request. When I heard about Saka\u2019s death last night, along with the announcement that Miss Dong would be taking over Saka, I immediately told Xu Fang to contact Miss Dong instead. Although Miss Dong is not well-known, I heard that her skills are just as good as Saka\u2019s. Plus, I heard from an insider that Saka had major depression before she died. Therefore, even if she was alive, she wouldn\u2019t be the best candidate to treat Third brother, due to her mental state.\u201dAt this moment, Master Zhan\u2019s eyes were glowing with light.\u201cAre you sure? Dong Yuetong and Saka are almost the same? Since you\u2019ve contacted them, did you receive any good news from them?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ve looked into it and both Saka and Dong Yuetong are both direct disciples of the Tang Sect. Dong Yuetong was actually adopted by Saka\u2019s parents and therefore, if it wasn\u2019t because of them, Dong Yuetong would be nothing. In order for Saka to shine, Dong Yuetong has always been keeping quiet and giving in to her. The things that they\u2019ve inherited and learned are actually the same. If Saka can treat him, Dong Yuetong would be able to do the same as well. If Miss Dong refuses to treat him, then\u2026\u201dZhan Yuheng did not continue but he made it really clear. If Dong Yuetong could not save him, no one else in this world would be able to do it.Since they had already given a death sentence to modern medicine, the only way to treat Zhan Lichuan now was to combine both traditional and modern medicine. Tang Sect was the most suitable candidate for this.After hearing this, Master Zhan happily grabbed onto Zhan Lichuan\u2019s hand and said, \u201cAh Chuan, did you hear what he said? Dong Yuetong is just as capable as Saka! If your brother is able to get Miss Dong, there\u2019s hope for your recovery.\u201dThen, Master Zhan turned over to Jing Qian and started complimenting her, \u201cQianqian, the master was right. You are the lucky star of the Zhan family!\u201dZhan Yuheng was speechless.He was the one who found the person, but Jing Qian was the one who got complimented?However, he saw that Jing Qian had already hidden her seductive look, which resembled a fox. She now looked like a cute mascot after being praised by Master Zhan.Well, since she was the one who got praised, Zhan Yuheng put away the unpleasant thoughts in his head.Master Zhan was looking at Zhan Lichuan, but Zhan Lichuan had just glimpsed Zhan Yuheng\u2019s face.\u201cThank you, Grandfather.\u201dZhan Lichuan suddenly opened his mouth, leaving everyone in the room confused.Master Zhan paused for a moment. Then, he realized that his sweetheart was thanking him because he had found Jing Qian as his wife.Master Zhan immediately laughed out loud. \u201cOh, my dear child! Why are you thanking me?

Qianqian, you see how much Ah Chuan likes you? You have to treat him wholeheartedly, okay?!\u201dJing Qian had no idea how the conversation ended up back to her.However, she could understand the warning from Zhan Shuyu, since she had overheard the conversation that she had with Una on the phone earlier today.Jing Qian did not feel guilt or fear due to being caught as she smiled and nodded, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Second sister. I\u2019ll take good care of Third Young Master.\u201dMaster Zhan immediately seized the opportunity and insisted, \u201cWhy are you still referring to him as \u2018Third Young Master\u2019? Qianqian, he\u2019s your husband, you should call him \u2018Ah Chuan\u2019 instead.\u201d\u201cUmmm, sure. I\u2019ll refer him to Ah Chuan, then.\u201dWhen Zhan Lichuan heard her answer so casually, he understood that she was just trying to stay out of trouble. For someone like her, who did not care much, it may look like she was very close to him, but in reality, she was keeping a distance from him.The servants who planted the Henbits had already left the mansion and they didn\u2019t get to capture the person who messed with his air-conditioner. As such, they didn\u2019t come to a conclusion as to who was trying to harm Zhan Lichuan.Although both Zhan Shuyu and Zhan Yuheng were the prime suspects, there was still a chance that it wouldn\u2019t be them. The Zhan family had lots of rivals from different industries, especially towards Zhan Lichuan, since his spurt had caused problems to a lot of people, there were a lot of other people who wanted him dead as well.After investigating it, it was revealed that Zhan Yuheng and Zhan Shuyu were both secretly doing things for Zhan Lichuan. Without any new evidence, they had to leave this matter alone.In the evening, Una told their nanny to prepare dinner in order to welcome Xue Ning.Xue Ning was the best friend of their daughter, Peng Miaoqi. The two of them went to the same high school and were now in the same college as well. Xue Ning had a financial situation at home and seeing that she was a good friend of their daughter, they decided to support her education in H City\u2019s Drama School. Xue Ning also addressed them as her godparents.Una may not be able to treat this \u2018daughter\u2019 like her actual daughter, but if Xue Ning remained a good friend to her own daughter and was able to help her, she wouldn\u2019t mind helping Xue Ning.Both of them would be in the entertainment industry anyways and would be able to help each other and Una wasn\u2019t worried that Xue Ning would take the limelight away from her daughter.As both the kids were chatting and laughing away at the table, Una was also having a good talk with her husband.Since there were outsiders around, Una didn\u2019t want to speak of Qin Yi, but she kept talking about how Jing Qian was being an ungrateful b*tch and that she was worried about how Jing Qian would ruin Qin Yi\u2019s chance as a first male lead.Peng Miaoqi and Xue Ning were both fans of Qin Yi. When they heard that Jing Qian was taking advantage of the resources that she had, making herself the first female lead and taking away Qin Yi\u2019s role, they started cursing her.Peng Miaoqi was Qin Yi\u2019s cousin sister and since she hadn\u2019t debuted yet, she was the president of Qin Yi\u2019s fan club. She was just saying that if Jing Qian had the balls to mess up Qin Yi\u2019s chance as the first male lead, she would get the fan club to riot.This was when Una received a message.It was a message from Jing Qian, and Una thought that Jing Qian was asking for a truce.Instead, it was a photo.In that photo, a woman was sitting opposite a man and feeding him ice cream. The man was enjoying it with bliss and satisfaction.She knew the couple in the photo. She knew them very well.That was her husband and the woman opposite him was her daughter\u2019s best friend, her goddaughter\u2014Xue Ning!At that moment, Una could feel her blood pressure rising rapidly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In addition to that, she was a famous artist manager, which was why she had never expected her husband to cheat on her.He even chose to cheat on her with their goddaughter!Una was fuming with rage, but when she remembered that it was Jing Qian who sent her the image, she felt that there was a possibility that Jing Qian was doing this on purpose. She may have photoshopped this image in order to trigger Una and ruin her family.\u201cGodmother, what\u2019s wrong? You don\u2019t look good. Did something happen?\u201dXue Ning, who was sitting directly opposite Una, was the first one to notice that something was wrong with her. She was looking at Una with concern. The clear gaze from her eyes assumed Una that Jing Qian was doing this on purpose. This photo could have been photoshopped, and even if it wasn\u2019t, there was a chance that it was deliberately taken from an angle. This photo may not even be the truth.It was as if Jing Qian knew what Una was thinking, because at the exact moment when she managed to calm herself down, another picture came.It was the check-in record to a hotel in S city from two days before.At that time, her husband, Peng Yonghua, had a project at S city and was there to check on the progress.It wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if he checked into a hotel in S city. The problem was that Peng Yonghua had checked into a luxurious suite, and soon after that, Xue Ning had checked into another room, in the same hotel, with her own id.Although it wasn\u2019t the same room, Una wasn\u2019t a fool. If the two of them were innocent, why would they be at the same hotel, one after another?Facing Xue Ning, Una suddenly asked, \u201cMy friend told me that she saw you in S city before this? Were you in S city the day before yesterday?\u201dXue Ning had already sensed that something was wrong with Una\u2019s expression, and now that she was being interrogated, she panicked.However, she was just a college student. There was a difference between how she reacted to a sudden situation and how someone who was experienced would have reacted. Therefore, for a brief period of time, Xue Ning\u2019s face changed but she immediately denied it, \u201cNo. I was in H city for the past few days. I didn\u2019t even leave the city.\u201dThen, her phone rang again.This time, it was a clear picture of Xue Ning standing in front of Peng Yonghua\u2019s room.The two were making out right outside at the door.The photo burnt her eyes and Una immediately turned crazy. She picked up a bowl from the table and threw it towards Xue Ning\u2019s face.\u201cYou b*tch! I\u2019ll kill you! I\u2019m the one who supported you through college, but you\u2019re sleeping with my husband?! You\u2019re dead!\u201d\u201cAHHH-\u201d\u201cLi Nianfang, what\u2019s wrong with you? Why are you hitting her? She\u2019s just a child!\u201dWith Xue Ning\u2019s scream, the entire Peng household instantly turned into hell.When Peng Yonghua saw Una beating up his sweetheart, he helped Xue Ning defend herself from Una. As for Peng Miaoqi, she went through the messages and realized that she had been betrayed by her best friend, deciding to join the battle.In the end, the police came, but Xue Ning was so badly injured that she had to be admitted to the hospital.Just as the police were bringing Una in for a testament, she received another message.\u2018Sister Una, I heard that you\u2019re at the police station now? Eh? Why? It\u2019s not a big deal, being betrayed by your goddaughter, right? What\u2019s wrong with that? Some say that we should always have some amount of drama in our life, that\u2019s why \u2018cheating\u2019 should be okay. We\u2019re humans, not god. We all make mistakes, right?\u2019Una was already so angry that her face was flushing red with anger, and when she read the message, she was about to explode.She clearly remembered that these were the same exact words that she said to that b*tch on the phone, earlier that day.This b*tch was saying those same words tonight, and she was doing it in such a cruel method!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She finished the drink in one go, took out the silver needles that she had bought and pierced them at several acupuncture points on her body.Then, she started introducing Qi into her body.While she was doing this yesterday, she felt as if there was a barrier, which was why she couldn\u2019t introduce any Qi into her body. However, since the previous owner\u2019s remaining obsessions were now gone, Jing Qian could feel that her body had become much lighter than before.With the help of the silver needles, a warm flow of Qi slowly entered from her TianLing point which is found on top of her head, opening up all the meridians in her body.Three hours later, as Jing Qian opened her eyes, the world around her was so much clearer than before.At her lower abdomen, there was a warm, familiar feeling that was circulating around.Jing Qian took out an awful-looking pair of sunglasses and took a good look at the quality of the lenses, making sure that they were made of acrylic.Acrylic lenses may be thin and light, but they were extremely tough. However, when Jing Qian poked a thin, soft needle through the acrylic film, it entered as if it was poking a piece of cloth. Soon, the acrylic lens was completely punctured by the silver needle.When she saw that the needle could be pierced through the lens, Jing Qian pushed a large force through the needle. Then, a soft \u2018crack\u2019 was heard. The entire lens was broken into pieces by an invincible force, shattering the lens.Jing Qian was surprised. This was because even in her previous life, her speed and strength were not at this level when she introduced Qi into her body for the first time. Looks like there was a good reason why this person was chosen as the granddaughter-in-law of the Zhan family. Both her body and personality were suitable for cultivating Qi.If she continued to do so, she would be able to reach her previous level very soon.After that, Jing Qian turned on her computer and wrote an article about nerve damage and paralysis due to a spinal injury, sending it over to the Lawrence Medical Institute of Research.She ended the article with an initial\u2014J.After spending about an hour on the article, it was about 2 in the morning.Jing Qian returned to the small lab that she had created in her room. She took out a bottle of medicine that she had prepared before this and placed it near the door.The customized medicine inside the bottle had a strong penetrating power and immediately entered Zhan Lichuan\u2019s bedroom.Soon, Zhan Lichuan, who was meditating next door, smelled the familiar scent once again.The smell had a chemical ingredient that he was extremely familiar with. It was for sedation.It was already 2 in the morning and someone was using this soothing fragrant on him?This person was definitely trying to sedate him!Well, unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t sensitive to any of the medications that targeted the nerves, which was one of the reasons why his treatment progress was so poor.After some time, the door finally opened.When the door opened, Zhan Lichuan immediately closed his eyes.Just like the night before, Jing Qian turned off all the security cameras in his room. She even looked around the room before entering because she was afraid that his robot may be inside. When she realized that the robot was nowhere to be found, she then entered the room.After stepping into the room, she walked towards the bed and did the same thing as the night before. She first gave him a massage that lasted for about 40 minutes. When the meridians on both his front and back had reached a good state, she took out a silver needle that was extremely long and pierced it through Zhan Lichuan\u2019s injured spine.His injuries were due to a collision against a hard object at an extremely fast speed, and because it was so quick, it caused a compression fracture of his thoracic vertebrae.Since the thoracic vertebrae was compressed, the nerves were severed as well and they were disconnected. This was why even when the brain was sending a message across, the spine couldn\u2019t transmit the message to his limbs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The roots would have absorbed all the nutrients and water, but due to a blockage in the main parts, the sections after that, which were the branches and leaves, would not be able to receive any nutrients. Over time, only the roots would be able to survive.However, after a certain period of time, the parts that did not get the nutrients would wilt and die. At the same time, it would even affect the roots that were absorbing the nutrients, which would then lead to the death of the entire tree.This was Zhan Lichuan\u2019s body\u2019s current condition.Because of the fracture at the thoracic vertebrae, the spinal cord was damaged, and the damage was permanent and irreversible.After this, he would have to face problems beyond the immobility that he had now. Since the nerves were damaged, it would slowly cause other neurological problems in the autonomic systems. His internal organs, including the kidneys and the heart, would start to fail as well.Even though during the surgery, the doctors had already stabilized the fractured pieces with a metal nail, the nerves were remained damaged. Therefore, the only method for a full recovery was to reconnect the nerves in his spinal cord.In order to reconnect the nerves, other than making sure that the bones were seamlessly placed together, they still had to reestablish new connections for the nerves.The silver needle that was now in Zhan Lichuan\u2019s back seemed to be no different from an ordinary acupuncture needle. Looking at the length of the needle, about 15cm had entered into Zhan Lichuan\u2019s body.No one would be able to tell how the needle managed to pierce through his body, but Jing Qian\u2019s hand was steadily and slowly moving the silver needle inwards. In less than 5 minutes, with a room temperature of 26 degrees, there were already droplets of sweat forming on Jing Qian\u2019s forehead, even as she was dressed in a singlet.After the acupuncture therapy, which was the most important, Jing Qian took out another extremely long needle and pierced it into an acupuncture spot that was between both of Zhan Lichuan\u2019s arms.Zhan Lichuan did not feel anything in the beginning, but when both the needles were pierced through his body and combined with Jing Qian\u2019s gradual exertion, he felt a warm flow in his body.Zhan Lichuan\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He knew what the warm flow meant.Ever since the accident, he hadn\u2019t felt the slightest sensation beneath his chest, including both his arms. He couldn\u2019t even feel pain.After losing sensation for about three months and being disappointed multiple times, he was finally able to feel a warm current in his body that reached his fingertips under such strange circumstances.Although it was only a warm flow that went towards his fingertips, he could genuinely feel it flowing through his fingers. Due to his excitement, Zhan Lichuan, who was pretending to be asleep, slowly opened his eyes.At this moment, Zhan Lichuan was lying on his stomach on the bed and his face was facing the opposite side from where Jing Qian was at. This was why Jing Qian, who was focused on exerting the force onto the needle, did not notice that the essential oil that she had specifically designed was not effective on Zhan Lichuan.The person who was supposed to be unconscious until the next day, even if there was a thunderstorm outside, was currently awake with his eyes wide open.The deep dark eyes that were originally emotionless were now disturbed by a deep, bottomless vortex, which also disturbed his emotions.Although he had known since yesterday that his \u2018wife\u2019 was a hidden master, he still hadn\u2019t expected her to be at such a level.This was something that even experts from the Capital were not able to do, but she managed to do it with only two massages.Since he had lost most of the sensation in the rest of his body, Zhan Lichuan did not know what Jing Qian was doing behind his back that allowed him to feel this way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then, all ten of his fingers started to hurt.Although all of these were a little uncomfortable, Zhan Lichuan still felt extremely excited.This was because it meant that there was still a miracle that could happen to his body, which had already been declared dead.About 20 minutes later, Jian Qian pulled out the silver needles from his body. Just like last night, she smoothly flipped Zhan Lichuan onto his back, put on his clothes, covered him with a blanket, and then walked back to her room.Similar to what happened before, as soon as she left, Zhan Lichuan immediately opened his eyes.He took a look at the security footage that had been hacked, and then adjusted it once again.He clearly saw that Jing Qian was doing acupuncture for him just now.He had tried multiple acupuncture therapies after becoming paralyzed. Most of the time, he would be covered with numerous silver needles, and in order for it to be more effective, they would run electricity through it.However, despite the numerous needles used and the electricity, his body was still unresponsive. It was as if he didn\u2019t feel anything.But tonight, Zhan Lichuan truly experienced how it was to be treated by the \u2018boss.\u2019From the very beginning, there were only three silver needles that were pierced into his body.The three needles were extremely long, something that normal doctors wouldn\u2019t use.But soon, Zhan Lichuan\u2019s attention was caught by Jing Qian\u2019s face, which was turning pale.Zhan Lichuan initially thought that it was Jing Qian\u2019s excellent technique that made it possible for him to feel the warm current, since the only thing that she had been doing throughout was just rolling the silver needle with her fingers.After taking a closer look, he realized that the movement of rolling the needles was not as simple as he had imagined.She was applying force onto the needles!It looked like it was an extremely large force, and she was able to skillfully pass them through the silver needle.This would explain why the acupuncture treatment given by the other doctors didn\u2019t work, but Jing Qian\u2019s did.When he saw her good-looking face turn ghostly pale with droplets of sweats appearing on her forehead, faint ripples formed in his eyes.He saw how Jing Qian had slowly placed everything back into its place and how she almost fell while walking back to her bedroom. Zhan Lichuan wanted to reach out to her.But, he realized that it wouldn\u2019t be possible because he was a useless piece of trash.As for her, she had already returned to her side of the room.In fact, from Jing Qian\u2019s point of view, being exhausted was a good thing, as long as it wasn\u2019t seen by any of her enemies.This was similar to stamina training. In order to get to a higher level, you must first break down all the accumulated energy. When you realized that you had been completely drained and had reached the limit, you would have to overcome it so that you\u2019d reach another level.It was the same with cultivating \u2018Qi\u2019.For her, she would be able to progress faster if she had more chances of being drained.The only reason why Jing Qian was chosen to be the Young Mistress of the Zhan family was that Zhan Lichuan\u2019s life was of extreme \u2018Yang,\u2019 while Jing Qian was of extreme \u2018Yin.\u2019 Since they were able to balance out each other, they were a match made in heaven.Coincidentally, Jing Qian had been practicing \u2018Qi\u2019 at night ever since she was a child. In other words, the \u2018Qi\u2019 that she had been cultivating was known as \u2018Yin Qi\u2019.As the life of the previous owner was of extreme \u2018Yin\u2019, it made it even more suitable for her cultivation. Perhaps this was why her soul had been reborn into this body.After being completely exhausted from before, it was time for a good sleep.After returning to her room, Jing Qian fell asleep as soon as she laid down while Zhan Lichuan, who was in the other room, watched the security footage until the sun rose.*****Although she had set an alarm, Jing Qian was still late.For someone like her, who had been struggling with insomnia, the only thing that she would never stop herself from doing was sleep.Therefore, even with the alarm, Jing Qian did not wake up at the time that she had expected. By the time she arrived at Zhongbo Entertainment, the regular meetings had already ended.Just when everyone was leaving, they saw Jing Qian walking into the room like a Queen, even though she was late, and their eyes were filled with ridicule.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everyone around was just waiting to see what would happen to her.\u201cQianqian, why were you so late?\u201dAlthough she had been mercilessly played last night by Jing Qian, Una realised what was most important to her now after thinking about it the entire night.Men were useless and women could only count on themselves.Plus, today was an extremely important day. As soon as the agreement was made that Qin Yi was the first male lead and Jing Lu was second female lead, she would be able to get commissions from three different companies.However, ever since Qin Yi got caught yesterday morning, Jing Qian had blocked his number. No matter how much Qin Yi tried calling her, Jing Qian wouldn\u2019t budge.Una was finally aware of the catastrophic impact Qin Yi\u2019s derailment might bring to their future.If Jing Qian had completely given up on Qin Yi because of this matter, they would never be able to get any resources from the Zhan family.When she realized that her smooth road ahead had instantly turned muddy, and there may even be a possibility of it being a dead road, Una became worried. Therefore, she changed from her usual arrogant ways and looked at Jing Qian, who walked in like a breeze during spring, and with a thick face, made up an excuse for her lateness.\u201cWhy do you look so pale today? Are you sick?\u201d\u201cSister Una, look at Jing Qian\u2019s rosy cheeks. Why would you say that she looks pale? Why do I feel that she looks so good that she couldn\u2019t be any better?\u201dThe person who spoke up was called Yang Yinli, a dancer who was also the leader of a girl group known as the Aurora Girls.They weren\u2019t close. From the few memories that she had, she remembered that the only time that they were together was in a show called \u2018Dancing Youth.\u2019However, they weren\u2019t even from the same company before this. About a month ago, she got married into the Zhan family, and with their help, she ended her contract with Zhongze Entertainment. Then, she ended up being an artist at Zhongbo Entertainment.After thinking about it for a while, she didn\u2019t remember how and why she had offended this lady.Just when the machine got fully loaded with bullets and was in \u2018roasting\u2019 mode, Director Xu Yan from the Artist Department spoke up instead.\u201cYou were sick, but still decided to come to the company despite feeling uncomfortable. That is something commendable. There\u2019s another important project meeting that you have to attend after this, so please be prepared.\u201dEveryone else was surprised.F**k! Could the double standards be any more obvious?Just a while back, Yang Yinli was only late by two minutes, but she had ended up with a fine and a huge lecture from Xu Yan. Yet, when Jing Qian was about half an hour late, this devil let it go so easily. Not only did he not scream at her, he even complimented her.Anyone with a good pair of eyes would be able to see that there was nothing wrong with Jing Qian, it was just an excuse that Una gave!Seeing that Xu Yan had already helped her with the \u2018roast,\u2019 Jing Qian stopped herself from roasting Yang Yinli herself. She glanced at her, then walked away with her head held high.With regards to unimportant people, the only reason why she would talk to her was because Jing Qian hated being provoked or challenged. However, since someone else had already done it for her, there was no need for her to waste her time with these people.\u201cQianqian, Director Xu had already arranged an office for you, which is just like a suite. From now on, we will have our own personal office. Come, I\u2019ll show you your new office.\u201dUna\u2019s behavior today was extremely nice, and there were also hints of a truce.She never said anything about the pictures that Jing Qian had sent last night, which caused chaos within her family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She\u2019s only a pretty vase that came to us from Zhongze. She should have just kept quiet, but instead, she\u2019s behaving so arrogantly. Does she really think that she\u2019s the best actress here?!\u201d one of the artists who looked really sweet couldn\u2019t help but complain.However, right after she spoke, she was nudged by her manager, who was standing next to her.\u201cWhy are you nudging me? Did I say anything wrong? Zhongze Entertainment is just a small company. How could they compare to us? All she has is her looks. Zhongbo was just trying to be nice to her, but she has already forgotten where she came from. She was acting as if she was a \u2018Queen.\u2019\u201cLook at her! Do you think that she\u2019s conscious about the fact that she\u2019s actually a newcomer? There\u2019s also something wrong with Director Xu. Why did he scream at Sister Li but not her? He was being extremely biased!\u201dStanding nearby, Yang Yinli\u2019s face turned dark as she heard everything, a fire burning in her heart.However, when she saw Mei Ruodan, who was standing behind, Yang Yinli\u2019s expression changed and she respectfully greeted Mei Ruodan, \u201cSister Dan.\u201dThe female artist who stood up for Yang Yinli heard her greeting and immediately followed and greeted her as well.\u201cSister Dan.\u201dMei Ruodan acknowledged them with a decent, magnanimous smile.\u201cSister Dan, why are you here today? Are you here for the project meeting?\u201d Yang Yinli quickly went up to her and affectionately held onto Mei Ruodan\u2019s hand with a bright smile on her face.Mei Ruodan smiled and replied, \u201cI\u2019m about to start the shoot, which is why I\u2019m here for the meeting.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great. I heard that this drama has a really high intellectual property and it would definitely be a hit if you joined. Plus, it is an ancient drama, so it\u2019ll be easier to get good results from it. I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ll be the next best actress when this drama gets aired.\u201dSeeing that Yang Yinli was chatting with Mei Ruodan, the other female artist went up to her as well.\u201cSister Dan is already a beauty, and with her good acting skills, I\u2019m pretty sure that she will be the next best actress in both dramas and movies.\u201dMei Ruodan\u2019s father held a high position in Zhongbo Entertainment, which was why she had been getting better resources than the other artists. She was only 25 this year, but she had already played the female lead for 2 tv series, both of which were incredibly successful. The best actress award was definitely hers.Therefore, whenever there was a chance for them to kiss up to Mei Ruodan, none of the artists would miss it.Mei Ruodan gently smiled, as she didn\u2019t think that these two were just trying to flatter her.However, Yang Yinli was good at it, and she was a gullible person, which was something that satisfied her.\u201cWho\u2019s that newcomer? She looks good,\u201d Mei Ruodan continued walking and casually asked. As for Yang Yinli and the sweet-looking girl from before, they stood close and walked along with her.\u201cSister Dan, don\u2019t you know her?\u201d The sweet-looking girl asked with a surprised look on her face.\u201cShould I?\u201dMei Ruodan was the type who looked beautiful and pure. Her smile was gentle, resembling the sweet breeze during spring, naturally making those around her feel good. However, as she asked the question, her tone was as cold as ice.The artist immediately understood what was happening and quickly replied, \u201cOh, what did I have to bring it up? She\u2019s just a small, infamous artist that came from Zhongze. She somehow managed to get a third female lead in one of the upcoming dramas. She doesn\u2019t deserve to be remembered by Sister Dan.\u201dMei Ruodan continued smiling and said to the sweet-looking artist next to her, \u201cThat\u2019s right.

After being in the industry for so many years, she had already seen all sorts of people. This woman was trying to get her to start a war and wanted to use her to fight Jing Qian. How would she not know?These types of people, who were incapable themselves but still wanted to create chaos between everyone, were the most disgusting and annoying people in the industry.Therefore, even though Mei Ruodan knew what her name was, she decided to embarrass her.The female artist who was given a \u2018slap\u2019 across her face, realized that her little plot had been revealed which was why she looked a little embarrassed. However, she quickly replied, \u201cSister Dan, my name is Fang Manyu. I\u2019m in the same group as Sister Li.\u201d\u201cEh? Sister Dan, you don\u2019t know Manyu? I always thought that you know her. She is the \u2018visual\u2019 of our group, the Aurora Girls.\u201dWhen the word \u2018visual\u2019 was mentioned, Fang Manyu\u2019s face had a subtle, shy look on her face, almost as if she expected compliments from Mei Ruodan.However, Mei Ruodan didn\u2019t even continue with the topic.Instead, she turned to Yang Yinli and said, \u201cOh, by the way, there is an empty role for a court lady who\u2019s good with martial arts in my next drama, \u2018The Queen of the General.\u2019 Although it isn\u2019t one of the main roles, she is one of the most important people to the female lead. It would be good exposure, and since you\u2019re a dancer, it should be easy for you to pick up on the martial arts skills. What do you think? Are you interested?\u201dYang Yinli and Fang Manyu were both stunned.\u2018The Queen of the General\u2019 was a drama that was extremely successful a few years ago and there was a huge fan base for the drama. Plus, it was a female lead drama. Even if her role was just that of a court lady, she would still be the one closest to the female lead. The exposure that she would be getting from this role would be even more than those who acted as the king\u2019s concubine.When Mei Ruodan saw the shock on Yang Yinli\u2019s face, she smiled casually and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You don\u2019t want it?\u201d\u201cI do! I want it! Thank you so much, Sister Dan! Thank you so much for giving me this opportunity!\u201dYang Yinli was so happy that she started bowing and thanking her. Her joy was beyond words.Although she was the leader of the Aurora Gurls, their group was not very well-known. After their debut, she never had such a chance. She only got to join \u2018Dancing Youth\u2019 because she was talented in dancing.However, variety shows wouldn\u2019t be able to attract many fans, and it wouldn\u2019t be beneficial to her future development either.If she got this role as the servant of the main female lead, there would be a qualitative increase in her fans and media coverage.If this drama became a hit, she may also be famous because of it as well.\u201cIf you want it, you better put on your best performance. Don\u2019t embarrass me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sister Dan. I will do my best, and I promise that I will never embarrass you.\u201dMei Ruodan nodded her head in satisfaction, \u201cThen you\u2019ll have to meet me for the project meeting after this.\u201dThe artists that were allowed to join the project meeting were those that the company focused on. She was only jealous and mad because she found out that Jing Qian was allowed to join the meeting.But now that she was allowed to join the meeting, she no longer felt that way.\u201cOkay then. The meeting is about to start. Come along with me to my office. There are some things that I\u2019ll have to inform you about beforehand.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dMei Ruodan left with Yang Yinli, not even bothering to look at Fang Manyu while leaving. Fang Manyu was completely ignored.Just when Fang Manyu was about to leave after being so thoroughly embarrassed, she saw Jun Leyao, who was holding a pile of things, walking into the elevator.\u201cJun Leyao, where are you going?\u201d\u201cThe recording studio.\u201d\u201cI thought you promised to accompany me to the dance studio?\u201d\u201cUhhh\u2026 I don\u2019t feel like going there anymore.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Fang Manyu felt ashamed, angrily rushing into the elevator to confront Jun Leyao.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Don\u2019t you dare leave this place without giving me a proper explanation.\u201dJun Leyao looked at the person who was blocking her way with displeasure. She paused for a moment and said, \u201cSince you\u2019re the one who\u2019s asking me to say it, then I shall. The only reason why I joined the Aurora Girls and the entertainment industry is because I like singing. No matter what happened in the future, I could accept it willingly. However, I do not like the schemes and rivalry of the industry. I especially hate those who try to plot against one another, trying to cause chaos. Therefore, I\u2019m leaving.\u201dWith that said, Jun Leyao pushed aside the arm that was blocking her and left the elevator.There were no common grounds between them.Fang Manyu was left alone in the elevator, pissed at herself. She didn\u2019t have support like Jing Qian, she wasn\u2019t as lucky as Yang Yinli, and she definitely wasn\u2019t as talented as Jun Leyao when it came to singing.*****There were numerous artists from Zhongbo Entertainment gathered in the conference room.These artists were different from the newcomers who would attend numerous daily meetings. Those that were here today were either senior artists or artists that the company was currently focused on, the receivers of most of the resources from the company.The person in charge of this meeting was the Vice Director of the Operations Department, He Kaiwei.The meeting held today was focused on the projects that had been recently invested by the company and how they would be distributed amongst the artists.When Jing Qian arrived at the conference room, there were a lot of people that were already seated. Since she didn\u2019t pay much attention to the entertainment industry, she didn\u2019t know much about them, even if they were popular artists. She just thought that they looked familiar to her, but she didn\u2019t know their names. After all, most of the people here would have been thrilled if any one of them were eligible to attend her parties in her previous life and would talk about it for days.\u201cQianqian, over here.\u201dAs soon as they entered the conference room, Una pointed to the centre spot on the first row.Other than that particular seat that was empty, the other important seats were already taken. The remaining seats in the room were by the side of the room.Una figured that even though the Zhan family would not allow them to reveal Jing Qian\u2019s identity, she should still let the other artists realise that Jing Qian\u2019s position was much higher than they could ever imagine.As for Jing Qian\u2026Even if Una hadn\u2019t given her the instructions, she would have naturally picked the centre seat anyways.It\u2019s not that she didn\u2019t want to be low-key, she didn\u2019t even know what the word meant.As soon as Jing Qian seated herself in the centre seat in the first row, all the artists, as well as the managers standing behind, looked at her strangely.The centre position was something terrifying in the entertainment industry. Not just the seating position, but even while they were taking a picture. Even for those artists that were well-established, they wouldn\u2019t pick the center position. On one hand, they were trying to be humble, and on the other, they were worried that they would be hated by others.However, Jing Qian, whose name was still unknown in the entertainment industry, immediately took the position while there were so many other senior artists around her.\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cDoes anybody know who she is?\u201d\u201cNo idea.\u201dAfter asking around, the answer that they all reached was \u2014 I don\u2019t know.Yang Yinli, who came to the meeting with Mei Ruodan, sneered and said, \u201cHer name is Jing Qian. She was originally an artist from Zhongze Entertainment and acted in a drama before this as the sixth female lead. She recently ended the contract with Zhongze and joined ours.\u201dAlthough both the companies had similar names, Zhongze Entertainment was just a small company with rising stars. As for Zhongbo Entertainment, they were a corporation of the Zhan family, and they were one of the top three Entertainment corporations in Country Z.\u201cHow did she end the contract with Zhongze? How did she join Zhongbo? Who was the one who paid for her liquidated damages? What\u2019s her story?\u201d one of the managers couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cI\u2019m not sure about that. She must have a really powerful background. Otherwise, where did she get the courage to sit in the centre? I\u2019m sure she only got to sit there because she was qualified to.\u201dBack in Mei Ruodan\u2019s office before, Sister Dan had already taught her something new, which was to kill others with flattery.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, Sister Dan had already looked into it just now and found out that she was only the third female lead.Getting the third female lead in a drama as a newcomer was considered eye catching, but it was much better than the rumoured first female lead.Plus, Sister Dan had even called her father and enquired about Jing Qian\u2019s identity, but even Mei Changdan, who was the Vice Director of the Artist Department, had no idea who she was. Therefore, Sister Dan just assumed that this was all because Jing Qian had a \u2018sugar-daddy\u2019. The \u2018sugar-daddy\u2019 must be friends with one of the executive personnel in the company, which was how she got the role.Therefore, her job now was to compliment Jing Qian and put her on higher grounds. The higher the position she was placed in, the harder she would fall.Soon, the meeting started and He Kaiwei, the Vice Director of the Operating Department, started talking about the arrangements that the company had made for each artist present.\u2018The Queen of the General\u2019 starred by Mei Ruodan and \u2018Mirror World\u2019 starred by Jing Qian would be mentioned together, as Zhongbo Entertainment was the largest investor in both these projects.After briefing about \u2018The Queen of the General\u2019, Director He reminded Jing Qian, \u201cJing Qian, third female lead of \u2018Mirror World\u2019. Come over to my office after this and sign the agreement to confirm the cast. You may be the third female lead, but you have quite a number of scenes to prepare. You haven\u2019t taken many roles before this, so if there\u2019s any problems during the shoot\u2026\u201d\u201cWait a minute.\u201dDirector He wasn\u2019t done when Jing Qian\u2019s charming voice with her unique drawl echoed in the conference room.Director He hadn\u2019t expected Jing Qian to rudely interrupt him. While he was still in a trance from being interrupted, Jing Qian spoke up once again. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that I\u2019m the third female lead?\u201dAlthough he was already informed by his senior that he should be nicer to her, Jing Qian\u2019s behaviour towards him had triggered him.\u201cDon\u2019t you know the role you\u2019ll be playing?\u201dDirector He\u2019s rhetorical question humored most of them in the room. They couldn\u2019t help but cover their mouths and laugh.As for those that were calmer, they just raised their brows.In conclusion, everyone in the room had a mutual understanding of the new artist in the room.Beautiful, stupid, with low EQ.Oh\u2026 and one more: arrogant.As a newcomer, being the third female lead in a star drama that was heavily invested in by the company was already a win, but she looked as if her talents were about to be wasted with such a small role. Everyone in the room was indeed surprised by her courage.However, Jing Qian wasn\u2019t afraid of Director He, who was trying to embarrass her. Instead, she continued, \u201cObviously, I know my role and I know that I\u2019m not playing the third female lead. Therefore, Mr. Director, if you can\u2019t get these simple things right, it\u2019s better for you to ask around about what is happening before coming to the meeting. Please do not waste my time.\u201dAt this point, the crowd no longer thought that Jing Qian was arrogant.This woman was insane!Yang Yinli hated how Jing Qian was still acting as if she were the queen when she was just a nobody. She could no longer hold it in, and just as she was about to open her mouth, she got a stare from Mei Ruodan and immediately decided to shut up.She did not understand. This new girl was just someone who had a \u2018sugar-daddy\u2019, so why should they be afraid of her?However, Mei Ruodan had already warned her and she just promised Sister Dan that she would work for her as her person. Therefore, Yang Yinli, who was burning with rage, had no other choice but to suppress the burning flame in her heart.\u201cHmph! I\u2019ve seen arrogant artists, but I\u2019ve never seen one that is as arrogant as you are! Your manager is right behind you and she should know about this better than anyone else,\u201d Director He mocked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019ll be best to avoid the fact that the both of you know what\u2019s happening, but I don\u2019t. I should be informed about what and how my role as the first female lead got changed into the third female lead.\u201dJing Qian\u2019s words caused Una to freeze on the spot. As she turned around, she was in shock, as this woman didn\u2019t even bother looking at her.\u201cQianqian, stop it. The company has already decided upon this. Let\u2019s just agree with it. We\u2019ll be able to get more opportunities in the future.\u201dThere was nothing wrong with the things that Una had said, since it was already a gift that a new artist was given a third female role in a heavily invested drama of the company. She was being nonsensical! First female lead! Wasn\u2019t she just being unreasonable?\u201d\u201cThe company\u2019s decision? How is it that you\u2019re the only one that knows about it, but I don\u2019t? Or did I misunderstand anything here? Are you actually someone else\u2019s manager?\u201dUna did not expect Jing Qian to call her out, shocking her till her scalp turned numb. If the Zhan family found out that she had switched Jing Qian\u2019s role for Qin Yi without her permission, she would be in huge trouble.\u201cI don\u2019t care. You better give me a proper explanation for this. Who is the one who took away my role as the first female lead. Since it\u2019s the company\u2019s decision, who made the decision? Is it you?\u201dJing Qian stared at Director He. Her eyes were sharp and there was no sense of fear in them.At this point, Director He was speechless and he really did not know how to answer this question.This was because the high ups had already informed him that \u2018Mirror World\u2019 was a drama that was specifically made for Jing Qian, which was why she was the one who would be calling the shots.However, Jing Qian\u2019s manager was the one who told him that she would be in charge of Jing Qian\u2019s affair.After discussing with the manager, he was promised a few things, which was why he made the decision himself with Jing Qian\u2019s manager.But now, Jing Qian was pushing against it.He has seen Jing Qian once before this and saw that Jing Qian was very obedient towards Una, which was why he thought that Una was the one who was controlling Jing Qian.However, looking at the situation now, that did not seem to be the case.Director He, who realised that something was wrong, immediately turned to Una and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did you not say that you were handling this matter entirely?\u201dUna\u2019s scalp had turned completely numb when she was questioned by Director He. With an awkward smile on her face, she said, \u201cYes, yes. Qianqian did leave this up to me before this, but she fell down the stairs recently and lost her memory, which was why she had forgotten what she had promised.\u201dThen, she turned to Jing Qiand and said, \u201cQianqian, it\u2019s true that you gave me the authority to deal with this matter entirely, but you lost your memory recently. Look\u2026 the matter has already been decided. Are you trying to make things difficult for me?\u201d\u201cSo what if I\u2019m making things difficult for you. There are so many people in this room, why don\u2019t you ask them? Even if they had lost their memories, would they have promised their manager to give up on their role as the first lead on a show and allowed someone else to take their spot before losing their memory? It\u2019s true that I\u2019ve injured my head and have forgotten some things, but I was not a fool before that, was I? Why would I give up my spot as the first female lead and agree to be the third? What good is it for me?\u201dAs she was speaking, Jing Qian slowly sood up from her chair and turned around. She stared at Una with a friendly expression, but her eyes were icy cold.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Tell us, in front of everyone in this room, as my manager, have you taken my benefit into consideration? Why did you conspire with someone else in order to take away my role?\u201d\u201cQianqian, I already told you that you lost your memory.\u201d\u201cSo I lost my memory, and now you get the right to conspire with an outsider and harm the interest of your artist. By doing this, does this count as a violation of our contract?\u201dThe look on Una\u2019s face was ugly beyond any words could describe.She finally knew why Jing Qian had been compliant the day before after learning the news that there was a change in cast; she had been waiting for an opportunity today.Jing Qian wanted everyone to know that Una had harmed the interest of her own artist and had violated their contract. If she wanted to end the contract between them and if Una mentioned the private agreement that they had, Jing Qian would be able to sue her in court.Una felt that Jing Qian had really tripped her, and she fell really badly.As she had no other choice, Una was forced to say, \u201cYou\u2019re right, I had foreseen your benefits in this matter, but you were the one who agreed to leave these matters to me. It was something that we promised. We even wrote it in the contract.\u201d\u201cThe reason why we wrote it into the contract was because I trusted you. But what about you? You used the trust that I had in you and gave the opportunity to someone else. Even if we had an agreement before this, does it mention that I would not be allowed to question you if you did something to harm me? Or does it say that even if you sold me to someone else, I would still be counting your fortunes?\u201dUna was speechless.Jing Qian was holding on to the matter and Una finally experienced how it felt to be put in a tough spot.\u201cRegarding this matter, I didn\u2019t think it through. I\u2019m sorry, Qianqian.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want your apology. If apologizing is useful, why would we still need the police?\u201d\u201cBut the decision had already been made\u2026. Why don\u2019t we just let it go for now? I promise to discuss all my decisions in the future with you before making them.\u201d Una has already placed herself at her lowest.\u201cDecided? Who is it that made the decision? You? Were you the one who invested in the show, giving you the right to decide? I can let go of this, but you better discuss with me before making any other decision. As for now, you should go and hunt for a good first female lead role for me. I\u2019ll give you one week\u2019s time. If you fail to do so, you\u2019ll have to compensate me with 1 billion yuan.\u201d\u201c1 billion?!\u201d Una\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re just a newcomer and the most that anyone would pay you for an episode would be 800,000. A drama with 35 episodes would only give you 28 million, and yet you\u2019re asking me for 1 billion?\u201d\u201cOf course, how else would it be a compensation then?\u201d Jing Qian replied with a smile on her face. \u201cI may be a newcomer, but the amount of money that I get from each episode shouldn\u2019t be decided by you. I have a contract with Zhongbo and they are willing to pay me 3 million each episode. With 35 episodes, I\u2019ll be able to get 1 billion in total. Your actions have not only cost me 1 billion, but you have also caused me to lose the chance of becoming famous, along with the endless possibilities that I would have because of this. Therefore, if I don\u2019t ask you for 1 billion, who should I get it from then?\u201dWhen everyone heard what she said, they couldn\u2019t help but take a deep breath.3 million each episode?That\u2019s the amount of an well-established first female lead.What kind of relationship did Jing Qian have with Zhongbo?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Did I find myself a \u2018sugar-daddy\u2019 or make myself a mistress? You can say whatever you want as long as it is the truth. There\u2019s nothing that I\u2019m afraid of letting everyone else know. Therefore, if you have any bad sh*t that you want to expose about me, go ahead. There is a possibility that I will let go of this 1 billion compensation if it is explosive enough.\u201dThe only reason why the Zhan family had not announced Jing Qian\u2019s identity was that they had accepted the condition that the previous owner suggested and the only reason why she decided to hide her identity was because she was still in love with Qin Yi. Her plan was that once she got the fame and fortune, she would get back together with Qin Yi and she could pretend that she had never gotten married.However, Jing Qian was no longer the previous owner. She didn\u2019t feel pressured about letting everyone know about her identity. She even felt that once everyone else in this room found out who she was, they would be extremely respectful towards her and would even try to flatter her.There was nothing that Una could do about the fuming rage inside her and she suddenly felt useless.She felt that the Jing Qian now was out of control and there was no way that she could put her under her thumb.Director He\u2019s face was also awful-looking as well.This was because they had already settled things with the crew and would be making the official announcement tomorrow. However, the third female lead decided to not comply and was asking for the first female lead role.He was the one that settled the matter, which meant that he had already taken in all the benefits from making it work.Now that Jing Qian was making a scene, Una\u2019s suffering was a trivial matter; the important thing here was that he may also be in deep sh*t because of this.\u201cEnough. I don\u2019t care what is happening between the both of you, but I will only listen to what Una said. Since you have already authorised her regarding this matter and you didn\u2019t even bother asking her about it, you are the one who should bear the consequences if anything happens. The official announcement will be made tomorrow. It\u2019s already too late for any changes now even if you want to be the first female lead. We will discuss this later on. As for you and Una, the both of you should settle it amongst yourself.\u201d\u201cHuh? You only listen to Una when you\u2019re the Vice Director of the Operating Department of Zhongbo? Who is she? Your mother? You only listen to her but not your company? Do you think that you\u2019ll be off the hook just because of the crap that you just said? Or is it because Zhongbo has given you the right to ignore the company and to only follow Una\u2019s orders?\u201dThen, she stood up and continued. \u201cI think that there\u2019s no need for me to be here for the meeting. You guys should go on ahead without me.\u201dWith that, she walked out of the conference room.Director He\u2019s face turned dark.He was aware that Jing Qian may have some sort of support; otherwise, the director wouldn\u2019t have personally told him to take extra care of her. If Jing Qian were to look for the director now, what would happen to him if the director insisted on investigating this matter? Wouldn\u2019t they find out about the benefits that he had gotten from this?\u201d\u201cJing Qian, stop!\u201dDirector He panicked and shouted at Jing Qian as he rushed after her.Una got so scared that she ran out as well.As soon as she stepped out of the conference room, she realized that this would be useless. Then, she called Qin Yi and asked him for help.Qin Yi became anxious as well. He was worried that his first male lead role would go missing. Therefore, he immediately used another number and called Jing Qian.Jing Qian saw the call and answered but as soon. as she heard the anxious tone, she immediately ended the call.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now, he thought that she was going overboard about this!Hmph! Thank god she had decided to stay single forever.After Director He and Una ran after Jing Qian, the remaining artists in the room awkwardly looked at each other.\u201cWhat background support does Jing Qian have?\u201d someone else asked again.This time, everyone turned and looked at Yang Yinli, hoping that she could answer them.However, even Yang Yinli was dumbfounded. She had never imagined that Jing Qian would be so powerful that she could be in charge of the cast list in a heavily invested drama!Wasn\u2019t she just a small artist from Zhongze? Who was she related to?Jing Qian was the earliest to leave the room. Therefore, when she entered the elevator, both Director He and Una didn\u2019t manage to enter it with her.Director He assumed that Jing Qian would be directly looking for the director of the Operating Department.Since there was someone else in the lift who wanted to go to the Operating Department, the elevator that Jing Qian was on did stop at that exact floor. When Director He saw this, his face immediately turned dark.She really wanted to complain about him.\u2018Hmph, you think that a newcomer like you would be able to defeat the vice director of the Operating Department?\u2019Did she really assume that he would be able to get this position without any skills?Just when Director He figured out how to defend himself, he put on a dark face and stomped into the Director\u2019s office. He became stunned on the spot.The director was happily talking to actor Xu and when they saw him, the director asked, \u201cDirector He, is there something wrong? Your meeting is over already?\u201dDirector He was at a loss for words, as he had no idea where Jing Qian was.*****Well, Jing Qian was already at the top floor of the building.\u201cMiss, may I know who you\u2019re looking for?

Is it Deputy Director Zhan Yuheng or Deputy Director Zhan Yihe?\u201d\u201cZhan Yuheng.\u201dThe secretary at the front desk gave an expression that said \u2014 \u2018I knew it\u2019.The head secretary\u2019s face immediately sank. She stood up and repeated her question: \u201cDo you have an appointment?\u201d\u201cNo, but I\u2019m close with Zhan Yuheng. Just inform him that I\u2019m here and he will allow me in.\u201dThe head secretary politely smiled, but her tone was filled with sarcasm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Miss. I\u2019m not sure how you came through the lobby and came here, but there are a lot of people like you looking for our Deputy Director Zhan Yuheng. If he met each and every one of you, he wouldn\u2019t be able to work properly. Please come back to us after making an appointment with him.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this why I told you to inform him about me?\u201dThe secretary smiled in return and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Miss. I\u2019m not obligated to help you with that.\u201dAlthough there weren\u2019t many small characters like the woman who would dare to put up such an act in front of her in her previous life, she was still aware of all these things. How could she not understand what this woman was thinking?As the secretary in charge for the Deputy Director, just because she wanted to get the opportunity that only had a possibility of one in a million, she decided to offend every single woman that came here. Jing Qian really couldn\u2019t understand how Zhongbo managed to develop into such a huge company with personnel like these.Just as she was about to call Zhan Yuheng directly, a huge door in front of her opened. Two bodyguards with a height of 190 cm walked out and stood by the door. They were followed by a good-looking woman who was dressed in a white suit, looking extremely professional.Jing Qian had met this woman in the Zhan family once. She was the granddaughter of the second Zhan family \u2014 Zhan Yihe.Master Zhan had a younger brother, Zhan Renmian.

Hence, she was still considered a real Miss from a wealthy family. Therefore, she had always looked down upon girls like Jing Qian, who came from a poor family but was now part of the Zhan family in order to bring them good luck.However, she knew that even if this woman had nothing else aside from her looks, she was still one of her great uncle\u2019s favourites. Being that Jing Qian was the person who was brought in to counteract the Third Brother\u2019s bad luck, Zhan Yihe naturally wanted to use the chance to show herself in front of the person that Master Zhan liked.\u201cQianqian, why are you here? Are you looking for Big Brother?\u201d Zhan Yihe asked her with a friendly smile on her face as she affectionately reached for Jing Qian\u2019s wrist.Jing Qian looked at the hand that was wrapped around her wrist and smiled in return. She mercilessly brushed off Zhan Yihe\u2019s hand and removed her wrist from it.Even though she had recovered from her depression, she still didn\u2019t like being touched by others.\u201cI\u2019m looking for someone who can call the shots.\u201dZhan Yihe was filled with embarrassment when Jing Qian removed her hand, but she still maintained a casual, warm smile on her face.\u201cBig brother is stuck in a conference call now. If it\u2019s something urgent, you can tell me about it first. When the meeting is over, I\u2019ll bring you over to his office.\u201d\u201cI thought you were going out?\u201dZhan Yihe smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re here now, so how could I leave?

I\u2019ve never seen her.\u201d\u201cWhy is the Deputy Director so nice to her? She even knew that the woman was looking for Deputy Director Heng?\u201d\u201cPerhaps\u2026.. She\u2019s from a wealthy family as well, and everyone in the Zhan family knows her existence?\u201dThe secretary that stopped Jing Qian, preventing her from meeting Zhan Yuheng, had an extremely unsightly look on her face.After entering Zhan Yihe\u2019s office, Jing Qian told the entire story to her.Since she was a poor woman now with only a few thousand left in her bank, she was extremely tempted by the 1 billion yuan that she could get for now. However, even if it was in her previous life, she would never let go of green tea b*tches like Qin Yi.As Zhan Yihe heard about the whole incident, she felt that Jing Qian was a dumbass.Her granduncle had thrown in at least a few million just so that his granddaughter-in-law would get the first female lead. She even had the opportunity to work with Yunxiao, the best actor from Huanrui Entertainment.However, this woman gave up on those excellent roles and single-handedly gave them to someone else.Then, Director He and Una were called into Zhan Yihe\u2019s office.When Director He learned that Jing Qian had skipped the director of the Operations Department and went directly to the Deputy Director of Zhongbo Entertainment, Zhan Yihe, who was also the Artist Director, he had a bad feeling.Although he had no idea what relation Jing Qian had with Zhan Yihe, he had no other choice but to blame it all on Una.\u201cDirector Yi, it really isn\u2019t my fault. Although the Director told me to discuss it with Miss Jing and she\u2019s allowed to make all the decisions, Miss Jing had a private agreement with her manager, Una. She had agreed to authorise Una and had given her the right to make decisions upon this matter. Una told me about the new rising star, Qin Yi, and told me to use him as the first male lead. I was just following the orders that I was given, wasn\u2019t I?\u201cThe official announcement will be made tomorrow and all of the actors have already made preparations for it. Even if we want to change the cast today, it would be impossible.\u201dAs Director He defended himself, Una, who stood next to them, did not say a single word, as she was worried that the Zhan family would ask her for compensation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The private agreement that they had, was it notarised? If it wasn\u2019t, then it\u2019s deemed invalid. Why would she have the right to decide for Jing Qian?\u201dWhen Una heard what was said, she turned pale.Jing Qian had been an extremely obedient girl before this and was Qin Yi\u2019s puppet. Therefore, she didn\u2019t even bother doing anything more than necessary. As for the agreement, it was only made to scare this little girl since Jing Qian was gullible and she didn\u2019t know anything about these.Who knew that Jing Qian had turned into a completely different person because of the affair?As a manager, she clearly knew that the private agreement that she had with Jing Qian was completely unequal. However, Jing Qian had been so obedient before this that she never expected that it would cause any problems.But at this point, it was brought up by Zhan Yihe.Director He was so scared that he was covered in cold sweat all over and said, \u201cYes, yes. I did not do my best regarding this matter. I should have asked Jing Qian personally.\u201cBut back then, Una said that \u2018Mirror World\u2019 was a drama that had two first male leads and it would be better if we used the well-known actor, Yunxiang, along with Qin Yi, who is a rising idol. It would make the drama even more attractive. Even if our company invested millions into this show, we would be able to gain more profit this way. However, Jing Qian was just a new artist. In order to prevent getting hated by the fans and to not ruin the show, she recommended a substitute.\u201d\u201cUna is the aunt of Qin Yi, the new rising artist, which is why she hopes that he would be able to play the first male lead. As for the second female lead, it would be played by Jing Qian\u2019s younger sister, which is also related to Jing Qian. Therefore, Huanrui raised a proposal that they would agree to this if we gave them the first female lead and we would give up on 20% of our investment in this show.\u201cUna said that Jing Qian had an agreement with her where she would be allowed to make the final call. So, I immediately came to an agreement with Huanrui.\u201cDirector Yi, the main problem here is that Jing Qian is still a new artist and I don\u2019t know her that well yet. Is it possible for us to just forget about this?\u201dDirector He turned to Jing Qian and made a 90 degree bow. He apologised to her and said, \u201cJing Qian, it\u2019s true that the Operating Department did not deal with this in the right way. I promise that I will change from now on! I hope that you\u2019ll be able to forgive the mistakes that I\u2019ve made.\u201dUna quickly followed after. \u201cQianqian, I\u2019m really sorry regarding this matter. But, you were the one who promised Qin Yi before this and even your parents. I assumed that because you had been so filial to them, so I immediately agreed to put Jing Lu as the second female lead when they called. Huanrui Entertainment is one of the top three companies in the entertainment industry, on par with Zhongbo even. Since we\u2019ve already come to an agreement with Huanqui regarding this matter, why don\u2019t we just forget about this? I promise to get you a better role in the future. What do you think?\u201d\u201cYou assumed?\u201d Jing Qian sneered at Una. \u201cHmmmm, what should I do then? The thing that you assumed was not what I wanted. If you can\u2019t return the role of the first female lead to me, then you better start preparing the money for the compensation!\u201dUna had already been \u2018attacked\u2019 by Jing Qian so many times this morning that she could no longer put on a fake smile. Her face was incredibly ugly at this point.Jing Qian turned and looked at Director He. \u201cHow many years have you been working as the Vice Director? Did you turn into a garbage bin because you\u2019ve been eating sh*t all this while? Is it that you didn\u2019t think of contacting me directly, or that you couldn\u2019t even bother? Did you really think that it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal if you bullied me? I\u2019m just a new artist in the eyes of the \u2018great\u2019 Director He. So, as long as everyone else is happy, it wouldn\u2019t matter even if you offended me. You thought that it was still a good deal after all.\u201dJing Qian suddenly turned and asked Zhan Yihe, who had been silent throughout the entire scene, \u201cDirector Yi, what do you think?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The first female lead in a star drama was taken away because of them, so we will definitely investigate it thoroughly.\u201dDirector He and Una both turned ghastly pale.However, Zhan Lihe continued. \u201cBut\u2026. you heard what they said as well. These dumbasses have already made it happen, and the official announcement will be happening tomorrow. This means that there is no way of changing it now. If we were to talk to Huanrui about it now, we may have to suffer even more losses. Therefore, you should properly warn your manager. Otherwise, history might repeat itself, where you initially got the chance as the first female lead but ended up losing it. If there\u2019s anything like this in the future, you can come to me. I will settle it for you.\u201dZhan Yihe\u2019s words sound pertinent and it was obvious that she was on Jing Qian\u2019s side. It was just that the result was not the best since she had no other choice as well. As he released a sigh of relief, Director He looked at Jing Qian in shock, trying to figure out her identity.He had already asked Una before this, but she never said a word.Zhan Yihe\u2019s solution towards this matter was satisfactory to both Director He and Una, and her attitude towards this matter was reasonable. It stands to reason that Jing Qian would have no other choice but to accept it as it is, and Zhan Yihe wouldn\u2019t be getting a bad review for her solution. If this were done to scare off the previous owner, it would have definitely worked, but Jing Qian?\u201cHmph.\u201d Jing Qian sneered without saying anything, but Zhan Yihe could already feel the chilliness coming from her.Zhan Yihe was shocked, as Jing Qian was able to send chills down her spine even though she had been in the industry for years.It was such a terrifying force!\u201cSo\u2026 this is your solution?\u201dWhen she saw the sarcastic look on Jing Qian\u2019s face, the smile on Zhan Yihe\u2019s face slowly disappeared as well.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case\u2026. Excuse me.\u201dIt was obvious that Zhan Yihe was not going to help her with this, so there was no reason for Jing Qian to stay any longer in her office, as it made her look like a fool.There wasn\u2019t much that she cared about, but the one thing that she didn\u2019t like was suffering losses like this. Some had told her that suffering a loss could be a blessing; Jing Qian didn\u2019t mind giving this blessing to others.Seeing Jing Qian leave so abruptly, Zhan Yihe panicked.She never thought that Jing Qian would be so unreasonable.She had just heard that Jing Qian had done something explicit for the family and won the trust and recognition of her Granduncle. Her status was now even higher than Big Brother\u2019s.This drama was given to her specifically by the Zhan family in order to make her famous. If this didn\u2019t happen and she complained about it to Granduncle, saying that Zhan Yihe didn\u2019t handle this matter properly, would Granduncle think that she was incompetent as well?\u201cQianqian, wait!\u201dJust as Jing Qian was about to leave, Zhan Yihe quickly stopped her.Jing Qian\u2019s only goal here was to deal with this matter first, and then they could talk more after that. Therefore, when Zhan Yihe stopped her, she did. Jing Qian turned around with an exquisite, charming smile that had a hint of playfulness on her beautiful face.\u201cSo\u2026 Director Yi, did you think of another solution?\u201dShe was just about to discuss it with Jing Qian so that they could come to an agreement that would satisfy both her and Huanrui, and wouldn\u2019t make them suffer too many losses when the internal phone rang.There was a sudden change on Zhan Yihe\u2019s face.The others may not know about this, but she did. This call\u2026. was from the CEO!CEO, an abbreviation for the Chairman of Ops Corporates \u2014 her cousin brother was extremely talented and horrifying even though he had turned into a quadriplegic.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You can just wait here for now, but please do not appear in the conference call. I will deal with your matter as soon as I\u2019m done with the meeting.\u201dWith that, she answered the call.The moment she was connected, the interface on Zhan Yihe\u2019s laptop connected as well.She had already disconnected it from the projector screen, but as soon as she was connected to the call, it instantly itself projected on the screen.Zhan Yihe was shocked. She immediately reached out and tried to turn off the projector.\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201dWith Zhan Lichuan\u2019s voice suddenly coming from the call, Zhan Yihe immediately stopped and froze on the spot.He hadn\u2019t appeared, but his voice had. It was obvious that she was being watched.The colour in Zhan Yihe\u2019s face slowly drained away.The screen lit up and showed the study of the Zhan mansion.It was an oriental, antique study, and there was a modern wheelchair right in the middle of the screen.Then, the wheelchair turned and an extremely handsome man with deep, stunning facial features appeared on the screen. A few magnetic buttons were on his head.\u201cSir!\u201d\u201cMr. CEO! Good morning!\u201d\u201cSir, how have you been?\u201d\u2026The greetings came one after another.Soon, many small windows appeared on the screen, each one filled with all the senior executives of Zhongbo Entertainment.Zhan Yihe realised that after three months, Zhan Lichuan had finally appeared, but his first appearance wasn\u2019t at a meeting with the Ops Corporates, but instead, with the senior executives of Zhongbo Entertainment, which was just a subsidiary of the corporate.\u201cThird Brother, why have gotten up from bed? Is there something important that you would like to announce?\u201dZhan Yuheng, who was actually already in another conference call, had no other choice but to abruptly stop his meeting and join the one that Zhan Lichuan had started.After all, as long as the other party didn\u2019t officially step down as the CEO of the Ops corporate, he was just a Deputy Director of a subsidiary company.This was the difference between him and Zhan Lichuan.They were brothers, but because of grandfather\u2019s favoritism, the difference in treatment that they received was as large as the galaxy.Zhan Yuheng referred to him as \u2018third brother,\u2019 but Zhan Lichuan, on the other hand, did not care if Zhan Yuheng was his \u2018family\u2019. He asked in a stern voice, \u201cDeputy Director Heng, do you know about our star drama \u2018Mirror World\u2019?\u201dWhen Zhan Yihe heard Zhan Lichuan\u2019s question, the look on her face turned extremely awful.\u201cYes, Sir. \u2018Mirror World\u2019 is one of the major projects that the company will be working on this year. The first female lead will be our new artist, Jing Qian. Is there any problem?\u201dJing Qian initially planned on getting Zhan Yihe to settle this for her and if they didn\u2019t come to an agreement, she wouldn\u2019t mind staying here till dinner.However, when she suddenly heard Zhan Lichuan\u2019s emotionless voice and even heard him mention \u2018Mirror World\u2019, Jing Qian couldn\u2019t help but turn and look at the screen.The Zhan Lichuan now was even more majestic than the one she saw years ago when he took over the position of the Executive Director of Ops Corporates.Even when he was only sitting down, his aura was like that of a giant that was three meters tall.His calm, unruffled steadiness along with his fierce temperament and unrestrained look gave him an aura that could overpower everyone present even if he was seated in a wheelchair.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The smooth flow on the suit was not disturbed, and there were no wrinkles formed despite his sitting position.The inborn dignity and gracefulness created a drastic difference between him and his elder brother.Zhongbo Entertainment was established by Zhan Lichuan single-handedly, and therefore, he was the Chairman instead of Master Zhan. Zhan Yuheng may be temporarily in charge of the company, but whenever the real owner appeared, everyone in the company would automatically bow down to Zhan Lichuan.This included Zhan Yuheng.\u201cDirector Yi, did you know about \u2018Mirror World\u2019?\u201dZhan Yihe could feel her scalp going numb, especially when Jing Qian was sitting inside her office. With the screen connected, Jing Qian, Director He, and Una were forced to appear in the conference call.\u201cSir, I\u2019ve indeed known about \u2018Mirror World\u2019, but I only just found out about the problem with this project. Jing Qian just informed me that her manager and the Vice Director of the Operating Department had negotiated amongst themselves to a private agreement. They exchanged her role of the first female lead for the first male lead role for the manager\u2019s nephew, Qin Yi, who\u2019s a rising idol, and also a secondary female lead role for Jing Qian\u2019s younger sister, Jing Lu. In exchange, we\u2019ve given Huanrui Entertainment the first female lead role along with a 20% profit.\u201dAs soon as Zhan Yihe explained what had happened, the faces of the senior executives and shareholders drastically changed.Jing Qian?What the hell was this?Why would Zhongbo invest so much money in a drama for an unknown newcomer?The main thing was that they had even incurred a loss of 20% and lost the first female lead to another actress!\u201cYihe, why didn\u2019t you report this to me?\u201d Zhan Yuheng\u2019s face looked awful as well.This was such a huge matter, yet he, the Deputy Director, had no idea about this until it was raised to their attention by this quadriplegic who had been lying in bed all this while.Plus, this matter was related to Jing Qian.Didn\u2019t Zhan Yihe know how much the old man valued this woman?!\u201cBig brother, I just found out about this as well. You were in a conference call, which was why I told Qianqian to come into my office.\u201d\u201cSo, what is your solution to this problem?\u201d Zhan Lichuan asked.\u201cSince this problem was created by Director He and her manager, Una, they should take responsibility for it. Zhongbo Entertainment should file a civil lawsuit against them with financial compensation.\u201dZhan Yihe deliberately avoided the crucial part of the problem and instantly blamed it on Director He and Una without a second thought. The pair turned as white as paper.She hadn\u2019t mentioned that they would be charged with financial compensation.Una was afraid of being confronted by the Zhan family, so she immediately defended herself. \u201cI was authorised with the right to deal with this matter entirely by myself. Jing Qian had already promised me earlier on that I would be in charge of all her affairs in regards to her entertainment career, and she even signed an agreement with me. Therefore, I have the rights to decide on her behalf for the cast of this project.\u201dUna viciously turned and stared at Jing Qian, warning her, \u201cJing Qian, hurry up and tell them that this was all a misunderstanding. You were the one who wanted Qin Yi and Jing Lu on the show as well. Don\u2019t you remember what your dreams are?\u201dThat last sentence?It was obvious that she was threatening Jing Qian.This was because Jing Qian\u2019s dream before this had been to make Qin Yi the best actor.If Jing Qian didn\u2019t help her with this matter, she would expose the fact that Jing Qian had cheated on the Zhan family with Qin Yi. By then, the net would break and all the fishes in it would die altogether; no one would be able to escape from this tragedy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If this matter were brought to life, she wasn\u2019t the only person who would suffer; Qin Yi and the entire Qin family would be involved as well.Now that she had separated from her husband, she would be needing help from the Qin family. If Una was willing to put the Qin family in trouble, why should Jing Qian be afraid, since he was just a scumbag that she had just broken up with?Just as she was about to speak, Zhan Lichuan\u2019s pleasant voice came from the projector.\u201cI think you may be mistaken there. Jing Qian\u2019s role is a decision made by Zhongbo Entertainment. It was a decision of the company\u2019s, not hers personally. This role was given to her specifically, and even if it was hers, she didn\u2019t have the right to change it; not to mention, you are just her manager. Zhongbo entertainment will hold you and Director He Kaiwei fully responsible for this matter.\u201cAs for you, Director Heng, the role of first female lead belongs only to Jing Qian. I don\u2019t care how you go about it, but I want to see results during the official announcement tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir.\u201dIt\u2019s true that Zhan Yuheng had already begun single-handedly dealing with the affairs of Zhongbo Entertainment and that most of the senior executives were on his side, but as soon as Zhan Lichuan, the Executive Director of Op Corporates and the Chairman of Zhongbo Entertainment, appeared in the room, he would still have to obey his commands.UGH\u2026. The anger! The rage! The hatred!Zhan Lichuan turned and looked at Zhan Yihe. \u201cDirector Yi, when I\u2019m not in, you can look for Director Heng if you face any situation that becomes difficult for you. Director Heng has been in the industry for years and he knows the basic rules about dealing with matters like this.\u201dZhan Yihe was thoroughly humiliated in front of all the senior executives of the company, but in the face of absolute authority, there was nothing that she could say to defend herself.Currently, her window was the largest on the screen, so everyone could see the most minute expressions on her face. Even though she was unhappy deep inside, Zhan Yihe still presented a professional smile. She stood up and said, \u201cSir, I\u2019m truly sorry that I did not handle this matter properly. If I face any difficulties in the future, I\u2019ll definitely ask for help from Director Heng. Please rest assured.\u201dZhan Lichuan took another look at Zhan Yihe, announced that the meeting was over, and went offline.The last look he aimed at Zhan Yihe was cold to the bones.Zhan Lichuan may be a few years younger than her, but his deterrence was something that she could never compare to.Even if he had turned into a quadriplegic.She knew that this was a warning from Zhan Lichuan.Although she was displeased about it, her heart still trembled when his eyes swept over her.Jing Qian stared at the projector screen that had now gone black. Zhan Lichuan may not have spoken to her throughout the entire meeting, but other than her parents, who died when she was five, no one else had ever defended her like he did.Even if Zhan Lichuan didn\u2019t help her with this matter, she would have gotten her role back by herself. To Jing Qian, unless she voluntarily gave it away, there was no taking anything away from her.However, Zhan Lichuan had given her role back with such little effort, so she was pretty happy about it.The feeling of being defended\u2026.. It felt good.Well, at least the secret massage that she gave him at night hadn\u2019t gone to waste.That\u2019s why they say that pretty people have the kindest hearts.As she looked at Jing Qian once again, Zhan Yihe continued to feel displeased. However, she adopted a different attitude before speaking to Jing Qian.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I assumed that it was just a small role that wouldn\u2019t matter to you. I did not take it to heart, and now my incompetent decision has harmed you. Third brother was right. I was not mature enough to handle a situation such as this, and I couldn\u2019t think of a better solution. I hope that you will be able to forgive me.\u201dJing Qian gave a warm smile upon seeing that Zhan Yihe\u2019s attitude had taken a drastic turn.She had seen tonnes of black-hearted white lotuses like her.For someone like Zhan Yihe, profit was everything. She may seem warm and full of sunshine now, but if you met her again in the future, she could still stab you with a cold, sharp knife. If that didn\u2019t kill you, she would still be nice to you if your existence benefitted her.For these types of people, as long as it wasn\u2019t life or death, they would still let bygones be bygones.\u201cNo worries. It\u2019s only worth a billion after all. Director Yi, you shouldn\u2019t bother yourself with such trivial matters.\u201dZhan Yihe was completely speechless.Now she was saying that this was only a trivial matter worth 1 billion? Why hadn\u2019t she thought of it this way when they couldn\u2019t come to an agreement before this?!What a petty person! Such an embarrassment!\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for the good news then, Director Yi. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201dWith that said, she ignored the awful-looking Director He and Una, who were still inside Zhan Yihe\u2019s office. She twisted her thin waist, which should have belonged to a villain, and confidently walked out of the office.As soon as she walked out, the door of the office opposite her pushed open.Zhan Yuheng had noticed that Jing Qian was in Zhan Yihe\u2019s office via the conference call just now. He was just about to look for Zhan Yihe, with a grim look on his face.However, as soon as he walked out, he ran into Jing Qian.\u201cQianqian.\u201dJing Qian was just passing through the front desk where the head secretary was seated. When she heard her name, she turned around and smiled at him. \u201cBig brother, your conference call is over now?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a conference call. I just had to deal with a few matters with the workers here. Why didn\u2019t you come look for me instead of Zhan Yihe?\u201dWhen the head secretary heard how Jing Qian had addressed Zhan Yuheng and also saw that Zhan Yuheng treated Jing Qian as if she were a priceless treasure, her face turned black and looked at Jing Qian with a pleading look in her eyes.Had she known that Jing Qian was Zhan Yuheng\u2019s younger sister, she would have never stopped her.In fact, she had already begun regretting it when she had seen Zhan Yihe inviting Jing Qian into her office. She regretted it so badly that even her guts felt regretful.Jing Qian glanced at the head secretary.The woman had good features and her body was above average. She would definitely score more than an 85, as she was even more beautiful than Zhan Yihe. Along with her temperament, it was obvious that she didn\u2019t come from an ordinary family. At the very least, her family was definitely one with a good background and support. Therefore, with all this combined, she did have a chance of dating Zhan Yuheng.But\u2026Since this woman decided to play the villain, there was no reason for her to play nice. She was never the kind who retaliated evil with kindness.She completely ignored the woman\u2019s pleading eyes and said, \u201cI did come looking for you, but your head secretary didn\u2019t let me in since I hadn\u2019t made a prior appointment.\u201dZhan Yuheng obviously knew about what these women were thinking.Previously, when Zhan Lichuan was still healthy and completely able-bodied, their gazes would always be on him. However, he was an upright man, and once he noticed that they were having these thoughts, they would be fired almost immediately. But now that he had turned into a quadriplegic, they finally remembered about his older brother. Since Zhan Yuheng was also more lenient toward them, these women became worse.\u201cSo, you didn\u2019t let her in. Why didn\u2019t you come and report this to me yourself?\u201d Zhan Yuheng asked with a cold look on his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Please give me another chance!\u201dAlthough it was quite humiliating, the head secretary didn\u2019t want to lose her job, as she was quite close to some of the senior executives in Zhongbo Entertainment. With this job, she had been able to bring in loads of benefits to her family business.At this point, she felt remorse.\u201cI\u2019m asking you, what is your duty? SAY IT!\u201dZhan Yuheng was being unforgiving towards the head secretary.\u201cMy duty is to greet clients and enquire if they have an appointment. If they do, I have to bring them to your office and serve them tea and refreshments.\u201d\u201cAnd if they don\u2019t have an appointment?\u201d Zhan Yuheng continued to ask.\u201cIf they have come without an appointment, I\u2026 I should report to you or your personal assistant to find out if you are willing to meet the client.\u201d\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t look like you didn\u2019t understand what your duty was. You were just doing it on purpose towards Jing Qian.\u201dZhan Yuheng had put on a powerful aura and was being extremely tough on the secretary. He wasn\u2019t showing any mercy to this beautiful woman.This was because there was a little fox standing right next to him at the moment. Even without Zhan Lichuan\u2019s protection, he would want to protect her.He wanted to show the little fox that even without Zhan Lichuan, he would still be able to give her whatever she wanted.The head secretary noticed that Zhan Yuheng was treating Jing Qian a little differently than he would treat others. As she wasn\u2019t a senior executive, she wasn\u2019t in the meeting before this, which was why she had no idea that Jing Qian was Zhan Lichuan\u2019s wife.She was only filled with even more sadness and remorse.The person that she liked before this had become paralyzed before she could confess her feelings. When she finally managed to divert her love and attention to Zhan Yuheng, it was taken away from her by an unknown woman.\u201cMiss Jing, it\u2019s all my fault and I\u2019m truly sorry. Please have some mercy on me! Could you put in a few good words for me to Director Heng?\u201dJing Qian was smiling the entire time, and when she heard this plea from the head secretary, she replied, \u201cWhy should I? I\u2019m not obligated to do that for you.\u201dThe head secretary was speechless when she heard such a reply.The other secretaries around were shocked as well. She was so mean!\u201cYou have neglected your duties as the head secretary. Report yourself to HR and get your pay for this month. You won\u2019t be needed here anymore, starting from tomorrow.\u201d\u201cDirector Heng?!\u201d The head secretary was shocked.Her family had put in a lot of effort trying to get her this job. They had spent so much money on her, but she was going to leave before she could bring anything back for her family?!However, Zhan Yuheng no longer wanted to talk to her. He turned to Jing Qian and asked her in a warm, gentle tone, \u201cQianqian, where are you headed to now?\u201d\u201cHome.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you a ride.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that, Big brother. I\u2019ll be able to go home by myself. Thank you.\u201dAfter rejecting him politely, she turned around and left.Zhan Yuheng, who was left behind, stared at the elevator for a few more moments before turning around, staring at the secretary with a stern look on his elegant face.\u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d he demanded.The head secretary bit her lips and wanted to beg for forgiveness, but Zhan Yuheng had already called out to his personal assistant and told him to hire another head secretary.When Jing Qian left Zhan Yihe\u2019s office, Director He became so frightened that his legs turned soft.He had thought that she was just a new artist in the company, so why was the executive director of the Zhan family involved in this?\u201cShe\u2026 She\u2026 Who is she?\u201dDirector He\u2019s eyes were wide open and completely filled with fear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why would you believe everything that she told you? Why would you do all these things just because of the little benefits that it would bring you?!\u201cIf you are on a suicide mission, leave me out of it! Get out! Get out of my office! You will definitely get sued by Zhongbo Entertainment! Just wait for it!\u201dZhan Yiheng felt wronged.Why didn\u2019t she directly bring Jing Qian to Zhan Yuheng\u2019s office instead? Why did she bring her here, into her own office?As Zhan Yihe was screaming at them, her door was pushed open.The person who walked in was none other than Yun Zhou, whom Jing Qian met every single day.\u201cAssistant Yun? You\u2019re\u2026\u201dYou Zhou greeted Zhan Yihe and said, \u201cDirector Yi, I was ordered by the Executive Director to pass something to both Director He and Miss Una.\u201dWith that, You Zhou handed four letters to them; He Kaiwei and Una each had two letters.\u201cThe content may be different but they\u2019re actually the same thing. One is a notice of expulsion and the other is a notice of litigation regarding the losses that you have caused Zhongbo Entertainment and Miss Jing Qian. We\u2019ll see you at court.\u201dHe Kaiwei and Una were both so shocked that their heads exploded with a loud \u2018boom.\u2019\u201cAssistant Yun, this isn\u2019t my fault! I had planned on discussing it with Miss Jing but Una was the one who showed me the private agreement that she had with Miss Jing. She told me that she was fully authorized by Miss Jing, which was why I was deceived and agreed with her suggestion.\u201dYun Zhou remained polite as he replied. It wasn\u2019t loud but it was harsh.\u201cDirector He, you are 47 years old, not 7 years old. Since you\u2019re working, you should be responsible for your own stupidity.\u201cAs the vice director of the Operations Department, you were easily deceived by a manager, which clearly shows your lack of intelligence. This also reflects that you are not a suitable candidate to be working at Zhongbo.\u201cHowever, while you may not be smart, the CEO does think that you are really good at earning money. You have only worked at Zhongbo for 5 years, but you were able to buy 3 houses in H city within such a short period of time.\u201cThis means that you are just dumb when it comes to dealing with the interests of the company. When it is a personal matter, you seem to be quite intelligent.\u201dThe colors on He Kaiwei\u2019s face were completely drained at that point.He\u2026 He had been targeted by the CEO. The CEO even targeted his properties!These properties\u2026 They were obtained through illegal means.When He Kaiwei realized that he was doomed, he could no longer remain standing and instantly fell to the ground.Una\u2019s face was also extremely unsightly, and she was fuming with anger.\u201cJing Qian was the one who brought me here from Zhongze, which means that I belong to her. She is the one who should be firing me; you have no right to do so!\u201dYun Zhou continued smiling, \u201cYou have signed a contract with Zhongbo, not with Jing Qian. Your actions have damaged the interest of Zhongbo Entertainment, which is why we have the right to sue you. Miss Una, we have already passed you the lawyer\u2019s letter. Please get yourself a lawyer and prepare the compensation money. Otherwise, you will be in jail for the rest of your life.\u201dZhan Yihe was admiring Yun Zhou\u2019s cruel performance, silently thinking to herself that Zhan Lichuan was such a mean person. She was grateful that she wasn\u2019t part of this mess.Well\u2026Just as she was silently celebrating her victory, Yun Zhou turned to Zhan Yihe and said, \u201cDirector Yi, the CEO thinks that you still lack the knowledge of basic rules when it comes to dealing with matters such as these and making a correct decision. The incident today has shown that you still need more experience, which is why the CEO has decided to temporarily remove you from your position as the Artist Director.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She instantly stood up with a furious expression on her face.\u201cWhat did you say? Say it again!\u201dWhile facing a raging woman, assistant Yun Zhou was like an emotionless robot, repeating what he had just said with the same exact words from before.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You are still the Deputy Director of Zhongbo entertainment. It\u2019s just that your position as Artist Director has temporarily been replaced by another personnel. The CEO hopes that you will be able to learn from your mistake and perform well in the future. If your performance is satisfactory, there is still hope that you will be able to once again manage all the artists in the company.\u201dWith that said, Yun Zhou passed the notice of expulsion to Zhan Yihe. He gently nodded to her before leaving the room.Zhan Yihe, who was left in her office, was in disbelief, wondering how such a catastrophic thing had happened to her!******Some shocking international news amongst the celebrities!Saka\u2019s body was found! It was \u2018Z\u2019 from the sanctuary who found it!Z held onto Saka\u2019s body, which was unrecognizable after being soaked in the waters for days. Then, he personally carried her into the crystal tomb that he had built for her and held the funeral.The funeral was only attended by The Sanctuary, but it was broadcasted live to the whole world.Before burying her, Z placed the world\u2019s first pink diamond ring, known as \u2018The Eternal Star,\u2019 on Saka\u2019s ring finger, making them husband and wife.Back in the magnificent conference room, there was an awful look on Dong Yuetong\u2019s face as she looked at all the Elders of the Tang Sect.These were Saka\u2019s parents\u2019 family and friends. When Saka\u2019s parents passed away due to an accident, leaving her and Saka to depend on each other for their dear lives, she could still remember the look on these people\u2019s faces.After that, as Saka\u2019s power grew and with her effort, she managed to overpower all these people at an extremely young age, most of these wolves turning into dogs due to despair.Now that Saka was confirmed to be dead, the fangs of these greedy wolves would appear once again.\u201cSaka is my elder sister. Now that she has left us, I am next in line. I should be the one to inherit her shares. Did all of you think that you should inherit her shares instead?\u201d\u201cSecond Miss, that\u2019s not right. Saka may have been your sister, but there are a lot of us that are actually related to her. Take me for an example. I am her uncle, her blood-related uncle. I think that there are a lot of us here that are more qualified than you are to inherit Saka\u2019s shares.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s your reason, Z from The Sanctuary just broadcasted his wedding with Saka\u2019s body. He should be the one to inherit it. He would be more qualified than any of you here!\u201dThe Third Elder laughed. \u201cHow does that count? He married a body and Saka did not willingly marry him. Even in international court, Saka\u2019s shares wouldn\u2019t be his. As for you\u2026.\u201cI think that Sir and Madam wouldn\u2019t have expected that the orphan girl that they had saved out of kindness would be the biggest winner at the end of the day. Not only did she take all of their inheritance and fortunes, she even took away the son-in-law that they liked. There might be a possibility that the life of their precious daughter had been taken away by this wild, adopted daughter of theirs.\u201d\u2018BANG!\u2019Dong Yuetong got so angry that she punched the wooden table that was right in front of her.There was a crack on the long, thick wooden table, formed due to Dong Yuetong\u2019s punch. The crack may not have been deep, but this was sufficient enough to show the elders that Dong Yuetong\u2019s strength was different from that of ordinary people.When they saw what happened, they froze.\u201cThird Elder, you can put whatever you want in your mouth, but you should be more mindful about what comes out of it. You\u2019re saying that I\u2019m the one who killed big sister. Where is your evidence? If you don\u2019t have any evidence, I can sue you for defamation. Then, not only would you have lost out on these shares, you may also end up in jail.\u201dThe Third Elder realized that he had gone out of line, becoming speechless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were a lot of us who saw it. Seeing that your sister would be getting married to Young Master Xue, you decided to make a move. Since you\u2019re willing to seduce your brother-in-law, who knows if you would have hated your sister, and in order to stop your sister from getting married to him, it may be possible that you would have killed her.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! Even Z from the Sanctuary has testified against you, saying that you\u2019re the murderer. What else can you say about that?\u201d\u201cWe are the biological family of Saka, but it was The Sanctuary who found Saka\u2019s body! Even her funeral was held by The Sanctuary! This is an insult!\u201d\u201cYou better watch your mouth! Z was just suspecting. Does he have any evidence that I\u2019m the one who murdered my sister?\u201d\u201cHmph, if he had, do you think that you\u2019d be able to stand there and continue arguing with us?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dMost of the elders that had the right to voice out their opinion had decided to oppose her, trying to frame her.Dong Yuetong was fuming with rage.These people were monsters, not knowing anything about ethics and integrity when there were profits involved.However, after spending some much time with these people, she knew that there was no point in her being angry.She calmed herself down and smiled instead. \u201cSince none of you have evidence, this means that I\u2019m still innocent, right? Since I\u2019m innocent, I am next in line and I will be inheriting my sister\u2019s shares. I hope that everyone remembers what the Tang Sect was built on.\u201cNow that Big sister is dead, if I refuse to treat those people that are in need, the reputation of the Tang Sect will soon plummet. Without me, the powerful people wouldn\u2019t respect the Tang Sect, and by then, even if all of you have more shares of the Tang Sect than I do, it may not be worth as much as it used to.\u201cPlus, we have been friends with the Xue family for more than ten years. If it wasn\u2019t because of my efforts in maintaining that relationship for all these years, do you think that the Xue family would still cooperate with the Tang Sect?\u201d\u201cSecond Miss is right. Although she had been together with Young Master Xue behind Saka\u2019s back, which isn\u2019t something to be proud of, it is Second Miss who is still with him now. If they weren\u2019t together back then, our relationship with the Xue family would have been broken by now. All of us are aware that the Xue family is in charge of the imports and exports of our jade business, which brings in a large income to the Tang Sect.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. We\u2019re lucky that Second Miss is in a good relationship with Young Master Xue, getting rid of all the troubles that we would have faced in the future.\u201d\u201cSaka was the one who personally taught Second Miss her \u2018Qi\u2019 technique. She may not be as good as Saka, but I would like to ask everyone in this room a question. Is there anyone who has skills that are better than those of Second Miss? How about the \u2018Qi\u2019 technique? Do any of you have it?\u201dAt that point, most of the talented people who were on Dong Yuetong\u2019s side started speaking.When everyone in the room got heated, Xue Jinyuan walked into the conference room, just as Dong Yuetong had arranged.\u201cElders of the Tang Sect, I am very sorry for Saka\u2019s death. I was her fianc\u00e9, but I fell in love with Xiao Yue. This is truly my fault, but I can promise all of you that no matter whether it\u2019s Saka or Xiao Yue, the Xue family will give them our full support.\u201dXue Jinyuan was very talented at talking.What he meant was that the Xue family would not be supporting anyone other than Saka and Dong Yuetong. It wouldn\u2019t matter who the next person in charge was because they would only be supporting the sisters.The head of the Xue family used to be the King of Navigation at the Delta, as he had control of all the routes on the sea. Even the Somali pirates wouldn\u2019t dare to rob any ships that belonged to the Xue family. This was why the Xue family was so important to them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They had no medical skills, and they were not able to maintain such a close relationship with the Xue family, like how Dong Yutong could. Plus, other than having some knowledge about running businesses, they knew nothing about defending the Tang Sect and they did not have that many advantages when it came to fighting their enemies.Soon, most of the elders kept quiet.\u201cSecond Miss\u2026 How much of Saka\u2019s share would you want?\u201d The first elder couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cI won\u2019t be taking all of it, but I want most of it.\u201d\u201cHow much would that be?\u201dAfter that, Dong Yuetong and the elders of the Tang Sect sat down and started to negotiate.The negotiation continued in the conference room for one whole day, from the afternoon of one day until the afternoon of the next day. In the end, they finally came to an agreement after considering how everyone would benefit from it. Just when they were extremely exhausted and hungry, thinking that they could finally celebrate with a good meal, there was a knock at the door.Saka\u2019s designated team of lawyers came with her will.The entire crowd, which had been struggling for one whole day, turned speechless.She was still making fools out of them, even after her death!They knew the lawyer that was leading the entire team, and it was Saka\u2019s designated lawyer. He was a shareholder of the world\u2019s largest law firm, Hamilton Law Firm, and also one of their best lawyers\u2014York.York did not look like his usual self, always smiling. Instead, he now had a stern look on his face and was standing directly opposite of Dong Yuetong. He took out a piece of document and said, \u201cMiss Dong, Elders of the Tang Sect. Good morning. I am Saka\u2019s lawyer, York. I\u2019m so sorry about what happened to Saka. Now, I will be announcing to all of you how Saka will be distributing her shares in the Tang Sect.\u201d\u201cYou want to make an announcement? Why are you qualified to do that? You\u2019re just Saka\u2019s lawyer. Each and every one of the people here are respectable elders of the Tang Sect. They are more qualified than you to be doing this.\u201dDong Yuetong was especially sensitive to the word \u2018distributing.\u2019Some of the elders that managed to get what they wanted were supporting Dong Yuetong now.\u201cYou can only make such an announcement if Saka had made this will right in front of us when she was still alive. Otherwise, no matter what announcement you\u2019re making now, it will not affect the distribution of shares amongst the members of the Tang Sect.\u201dYork was not annoyed at all. He was an experienced lawyer at the world\u2019s largest law firm, and he had been facing people like this for a long time. He had seen conflicts in much bigger corporations.York chuckled and said, \u201cPlease calm down. Can you see the camera in my hand, which is recording? There is a live broadcast that is going on with this camera. Saka mentioned that once she died, I would have to do a global live broadcast of the announcement of her will and the distribution of her shares in front of all her senior executives working for her company on the third morning after her death. Everything that you have said or will be saying will be broadcasted live.\u201dAs the word \u2018distribution\u2019 appeared once again, Dong Yuetong felt her head spin.\u201cA will? How is it possible that there is a will?! She was so young! How would she know that she was about to die? THIS IS FAKE! THE WILL THAT YOU HAVE IS DEFINITELY FAKE!\u201d\u201cMiss Dong, the authenticity of the will in my hands can be proven. If you don\u2019t believe it, you can file a lawsuit in court. As for now, I will be showing you a video of Saka declaring her will.\u201dWHAT?! It wasn\u2019t only on paper? He also had a video?Everyone was shocked.The lawyers even brought their own projector, the video that Saka had recorded before her death appearing on the screen.

That\u2019s right, I have depression, but please do not worry, my depression isn\u2019t serious, and I have no suicidal thoughts. However, there is something that has been bothering me these days. I just found out that my younger sister, whom I trusted the most in the world, has been sleeping with my fianc\u00e9, whom my parents had chosen for me. Other than that, I also realized that there have been a lot more assassinations happening than usual.\u201d\u201cRUBBISH! She\u2019s being nonsensical! She was suicidal.

If I really wanted her dead, I wouldn\u2019t have saved her in the first place!\u201dDong Yuetong was so angry that even her liver started hurting, causing her to shiver.She couldn\u2019t understand why Saka was blindly lying about the fact that she did not have any suicidal thoughts. She clearly had severe depression!\u201cWell, of course, I can\u2019t say for sure that it is my younger sister, Dong Yuetong, and my fianc\u00e9, Xue Jinyuan, who are trying to murder me. I have been investigating it. However, it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.

What do you guys think?\u201cTherefore, in order to prevent others from encroaching on my properties, I have decided to make a will with York.\u201cUp until now, other than the small random businesses that the Tang Sect has, the 5 main industries include medical facilities, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, resorts and jewelries. All of these were started with the help of a few of my friends and myself. They do bring in a lot of profits and it adds up to about 85% of the income of the Tang Sect.\u201cHowever, all of these were not related to my sister or the elders of the Tang Sect. Therefore, after my death, all the shares will be distributed to the people who have been developing these properties alongside me. They include\u2026\u201dThe elders of Tang Sect, along with Dong Yuetong, widened their eyes when Saka\u2019s voice paused for a few seconds.They really want to know who these people were so that they could buy the shares from them.Especially Dong Yuetong.She really hated this b*tch from the bottom of her heart. She knew that this was Saka\u2019s revenge on her.Did Saka really think that by passing these properties to others, she would have no other choice but to accept it?As long as they belonged to the Tang Sect, they belonged to her.If she found out who these people were, there were a million ways she would be able to kill them.After getting everyone\u2019s attention, Saka finally spoke.\u201cThey are Jing, Mo, Chang, and Chen. As for how the shares will be distributed, I\u2019m sure that the four of you are clear about that. I hope that you will be able to bring my businesses to another level.\u201cAs for the remaining 15%, they will be distributed all over the world and will be handled by the elders of the Tang Sect. These properties are entirely yours. If the day comes where I am killed, you can choose to continue to stay at the Tang Sect or you can leave.

I am wishing you eternal happiness with the dog, and hope that the two of you will be able to grow old and healthy together!\u201dWhat the f*ck?

Before making the will, the certification center evaluated her mental status to make sure that the will was legally valid.\u201cMiss Saka\u2019s shares are her personal belongings and have nothing to do with the Tang Sect, which is why you have no rights to distribute it.

However, from now onwards, no matter how profitable they are, the Tang Sect will only be able to get 15% from the profit.\u201d\u201cI already told you that I don\u2019t acknowledge this will!\u201d Dong Yuetong was not as weak and soft as her usual self. Now there was a fierce look on her face.However, York was not affected by her, continuing to speak, \u201cMiss Dong, this has nothing to do with whether or not you acknowledge this will. You do not have the shares or the management rights to these properties. They were not even yours to begin with, so how would you be able to comment on it? I\u2019m just here to announce Miss Saka\u2019s will. As for her shares, as soon as her body was found, they were distributed to the four inheritors that she had personally chosen. My job here is done. You can go on with your meeting. Good day.\u201dThen, he exited the conference room along with his huge team of lawyers and left the place in three helicopters.The sea breeze blew, and the waves crashed against the rocks.Dong Yuetong and the elders of the Tang Sect ran after them, but they only saw the helicopters, which was far away, and the huge waves that were crashing against the rocks.The huge impact on the rocks was like the impacts of this meeting on their hearts.\u201cFind out who the four people are! Jing, Mo, Chang, and Chen! The properties belonged to the Tang Sect and the management rights are with us. I don\u2019t believe that I wouldn\u2019t be able to find out who the largest shareholders are!\u201dDong Yuetong gave the orders, her teeth clenched in anger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - Not allowed to ignore his wifePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100: 100: Not allowed to ignore his wifeTranslator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat TranslationWhen Jing Qian got back to the Zhan mansion, Zhan Lichuan, who would usually be lying in his bedroom, was not in his bed. Surprisingly, he was dealing with some affairs in the study.When Jing Qian knocked on the door and walked into the room, she saw a man dressed in a suit, seated by the table while meticulously looking through some documents in front of him.Bright sunlight was shining into the room through the panoramic window, colliding with the darkness of the room. The sunlight swept past him, and in between them, a faint silhouette was formed. A part of him was covered by a faint glow, seeming very unrealistic.She could only see him clearly by taking another step closer.He was still wearing the same suit from the earlier meeting.The exquisite work on the suit carved his body\u2019s figure into perfection.The tie that was around his collar had been removed, and in order for him to be more comfortable, the first two buttons of the shirt underneath his suit had been undone.His Adam\u2019s apple, which was extremely sexy, was quietly bulging from his neck, just like his personality. He was so stunning and talented that it was extremely terrifying, but he remained humble in order not to cause any trouble.At this moment, he was seated in his wheelchair, which made his facial features stand out amongst the rest of his body.His facial features were perfect. Each and every line was created in a way that made it seen as if they had been perfectly curated by god. The way that his eyes and nose were placed together formed a perfect picture.He was so f**king gorgeous!Jing Qian couldn\u2019t help but curse while she was admiring the man\u2019s handsome face.As for Zhan Lichuan, he noticed that there was someone in the room, which was why he turned around. When he saw that it was Jing Qian, his eyes remained stuck there.He couldn\u2019t deny the fact that his dear wife had truly captured his attention and curiosity.Because he was paying attention to her, he realized that for the past three months, while he had been absent from the company, some of the senior executives had already forgotten about his existence.This didn\u2019t really matter to him before since he was already paralyzed. He had already lost hope in life, so he didn\u2019t really care about the company.However\u2026When he saw how she had been bullied, he felt a sense of unexplained rage deep inside his heart.To ignore who he was now\u2026 Sure, go ahead.To ignore his wife\u2026 No way!It didn\u2019t matter if their marriage would last 1 month or 2 months, or if he managed to survive for another 6 months. Even if it was really possible for him to stand up in the future. As long as he was alive, he didn\u2019t want to see her getting bullied.Since he was married to her, even if wasn\u2019t able to please her intimately\u2026 He would still be able to provide her a sense of security.When she saw the handsome man looking at her, Jing Qian stared into Zhan Lichuan\u2019s eyes and started giving him flirtatious looks, followed by a sexy, charming smile.If this was Zhan Yuheng, he would have felt that this feeling was similar to being stared upon by a vixen that was a thousand years old.Perhaps it was because there was something wrong with Zhan Lichuan\u2019s eyes or maybe it was due to the sunlight that was coming in from the panoramic window, but he felt that the woman\u2019s smile seemed a little silly.The Jing family didn\u2019t treat her well. It could even be said that they had been harsh on her, but in order to save the Jing family from the verge of bankruptcy, she had resolutely decided to marry a quadriplegic like him.Qin Yi wasn\u2019t treating her well either, but in order to get the minimal amount of love and care from the other party, she had been willing to marry him, even signing such an unfair agreement with Qin Yi\u2019s aunt.Even the money that she had gotten from the Zhan family was given to her family and her ex. She didn\u2019t leave anything for herself.After marrying him, he was never nice to her before this, but she was still willing to silently come into his room just to give him a massage and acupuncture. She had even saved his life.This little girl may look like a cunning fox, but she was really just a silly sheep.She was nice to everyone around her, yet she was the only person who would suffer.Jing Qian absolutely had no idea that during this time, she had been labeled a \u2018silly sheep.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
